Two Weeks: Observations

Hey all,

So it's been two weeks smoke-free, and I'm feeling great! I'm quitting on the patch, and have since scaled down to 14mg. I wanted to quickly outline what's changed, both positive and negative, and how I plan on going forward (helps hold myself accountable).

**Positive**

**I can breathe!** - As an asthmatic who smoked for ten years (shudder), this is the first time in a long time that I don't constantly break down having an attack three or four times a day. My breath is deeper, more consistent, and I've all but stopped using a ventalator. This is really the main motivation behind the quit.

**More energy** - I feel much more active, and I'm finding my 2-3 times/week gym schedule much easier since I quit. I'm a lot less winded and have more energy throughout the day.

**Taste and smell** - I can actually taste and smell things again. The joys of eating an orange/drinking coffee/sitting down for a great meal are so much better already.

**I smell better** - Second-hand smoke now smells as revolting as it does to non-smokers (probably more so)...I smelled like that all the time for ten years...

**More time** - This is a weird one. I had no idea how much of my life was based on smoking. Now I'm in a lot less of a rush, and can sit for hours at a time if that's what I want/is needed.

**Feeling feelings** - This is a weird one too. For years I tamped down negative emotional reactions (anger, sadness, joy, love, whatever) with smoking. Now I allow myself to feel feelings when they arise, and then let go. It's a total revolution.

**Money** - I've saved over a hundred dollars so far. It's going in a separate account to buy a suit I've had my eye on for ages.



**Challenges**

**Mood** - This has been really difficult for me (see point above). On my bad days, it's crippling. I keep telling myself that the bad feelings are temporary, and that smoking never helped anyway, and they eventually subside.

**Skin** - Another weird one. I have dry skin/ecsema, but it's gotten a lot worse since quitting. I'm not sure I've ever heard of this before.

**Can't sleep** - I had this tendancy before, but it's gotten much worse since quitting, especially since I started a job where I have to be up early on the daily. I'm hoping this evens out eventually, but for now I'm getting 5-6 hours/night and making up for it on weekends.

**Stomach issues** - My digestive tract is really out of wack. Again, I had stomach issues before the quit, I think I'm just noticing them more now. I look forward to the day I shit normally.

**Headache/cold symptoms** - These have been constant and really rough since the quit date. I know these are common (particularly the cold) but I hope the headache goes away soon.

I also have a question regarding the patch. I've seen a lot of people here say it just makes the cravings go on longer than they have to, which I get. But I also cannot afford to take any time off work, and have a very busy schedule on weekends. I feel like it's working for me so I plan on continuing to use it...however, what is the consensus on cutting it down yet again even though it's only been two weeks? Could this put me at risk of relapse?

Thank you all for the support!!!

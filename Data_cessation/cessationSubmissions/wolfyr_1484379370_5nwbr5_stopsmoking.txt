So I quit smoking. What can I expect to happen now?

I tried quitting about a year ago, but couldn't do it. I've quit again now, but I'm going to make this time a permanent thing. Been smoking for about 7 years, so what can I expect to happen? Right now, my face hurts, I've got a runny nose, my throat's acting up and my lungs feel very congested. I'm also very distracted. Is this all normal or am I coming down with the flu?

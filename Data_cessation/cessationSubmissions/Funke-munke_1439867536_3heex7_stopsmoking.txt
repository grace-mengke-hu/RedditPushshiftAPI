I Failed AGAIN!!!

Please ignore my badge. I just sent the request to remove it. I failed one week into my last quit and never reset. I hate this habit but it I just keep going back for more.  All summer it's been excuses. Delaying tactics , different quit dates. I have tried everything, vaping , patches, Allen Carr, lozenges.  What am I missing?  Some please help?

Way easier than I thought

I know a lot of people really struggle quitting but I am finding it so easy two weeks in. 

I have smoked for 17 years. Has anyone else experienced this when quitting?

I keep expecting to get serious cravings but I have had none so far. My housemate smokes and all my friends smoke when they call but it doesn't bother me. I fear that my only downfall may be when I am drunk but I am not drinking for January so hopefully that will help.

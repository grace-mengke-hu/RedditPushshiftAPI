I did it and I think it'll stick!

Hey all, I smoked on and off (nonsmoking gaps of anywhere from a few months to 2 years) for about 12 years. Menthol was always my go to.

Well about 6 or 7 weeks ago just woke up one day, saw I had no cigarettes and decided not to buy a new pack. I'm going through some interpersonal growth at the moment and usually smoking would be my go-to in moments when I feel like I'd need control or peace. I bought an ecigarette thing at one point just to deal with cravings but I haven't touched that in about 2 weeks.

Now I occasionally have cravings. But for the most part I feel like I've actually turned the corner. As my body has gotten healthier and healthier I just don't feel the desire. I don't miss waking up with literally the grossest ickiness in my mouth. I don't miss the way it'd sometimes tinge my mustache. I don't miss hacking. And geez, things taste and smell sooooo much better. It's nuts.

I'm glad I quit. I hope you all are able to kick the habit and keep it that way. I understand it's hard but it's definitely worth it!

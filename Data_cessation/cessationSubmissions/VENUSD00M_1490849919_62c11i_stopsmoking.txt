Relapse after 4 days

Haven't smoked a single one since sunday.
Didn't even feel cravings yesterday and yet after being unsupported by family members and some of them even going as far as teasing me and implying i am boring if i dont smoke. Then i just lost it and went on with it. Smoked 10 cigarettes last night in quick chain succsession and this morning I bought a pack and it is still unopened. Not sure should I just go with it for today as in smoke,and begin again tommorow.Or should i just trow it away.
One thing i am sure.I am going to quit.

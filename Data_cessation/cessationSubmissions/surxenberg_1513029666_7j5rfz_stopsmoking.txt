The smoking dream...

It just won't leave me alone. Every now and then, I dream of smoking and what a stupid fucker I'd be for resetting my quit to zero. I was smoke-free for over 5 years before I relapsed last summer (best friend's bachelor party) and it took me years to get rid of the smoking dream...

I'm not the only one who has it, right? I've had zero cravings in my every day life for months, I don't miss it at all... but I still dream of smoking that one cigarette that fucks up my quit at least once a week...

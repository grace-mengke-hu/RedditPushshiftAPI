Some opinions needed- specifically, do lozenges count?

Hi. I quit smoking about 10 years ago, for about 5 years. For what I now regard as stupid reasons I started back about 5 years ago. For the past 2 years or so, I have more or less *mostly* quit smoking, but I've lozenges instead.

I occasionally slip and smoke nowadays, primarily when I'm drinking *and* around other smokers. I'd like to claim a non-smoking badge, but I am not prepared to give up the lozenges just yet. I want the badges as an additional motivator to keep clean. 

So, do lozenges count if you continue using them for long periods? Also, does anyone have any lozenge use stories to share? Any ill health effects?

Thanks very much.

**tl;dr** Does lozenge use count as smoking, so long as you're ONLY using lozenges?

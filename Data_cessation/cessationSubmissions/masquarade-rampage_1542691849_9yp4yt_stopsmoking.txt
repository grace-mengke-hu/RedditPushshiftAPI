First time poster wanting to quit

I love this sub and reading your stories.  I think, if they can do it, so can I!
Been a smoker for about 25 years.  I did quit for four years once, but went back on them again due to emotional stress.  When I first quit, it was like a switch went off in my brain.  Cold turkey, no cravings.  Now I want to quit again, that switch isn't switching off :(.  Will have to do it the hard way.  I don't really want to quit (just being honest), but I have to.  My breathing isn't good, I can feel the gurgle in my lungs and I can't do anything physical because I just end up wheezing.  Also, the cost here in Australia is $48 for a pack of 40's!!  For the sake of my health and bank account, I have no option but to kick this horrible habit.   Wish me luck!
Also, what is the app people are using that shows them money saved and how many days they've been off the smokes?  Thanks in advance

30 Days

I made it! I made it ! I fucking made it! 30 days smoke free!!! Subsequently, I have also been completely sober for the same amount of time. I honestly feel a bit down today but that's not going be an excuse to smoke or drink for me. No sir/ma'am. I'm proud of myself! Boom! It's a mindset folks. Stay strong. You will face ups and downs. Quitting anything doesn't stop life from happening. You just have to keep moving. Change the script in your head. Your mind will tell you it's hard. Don't listen. You got this.

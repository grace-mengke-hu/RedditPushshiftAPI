Day 6

Hi all,
I’m on day 6 and it’s the hardest day by far. It’s my first day back at work and I literally can’t think of anything but how much I want to smoke. It was always a reward or opportunity to take a break and without it I feel completely unmotivated. I can’t concentrate and I’m really irritable and almost upset. 
I’ve been drinking lots of cold water and green tea, taking regular breaks but I still want to jump out of my skin. Does anyone have any tips? Do I just need to ride it out? 
I really want to stay strong and I’ve been so proud of how well I was doing but this is torture!!!

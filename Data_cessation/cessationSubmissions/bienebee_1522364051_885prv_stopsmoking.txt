Brain making conspiracy theories

I'm on day 9. I was supossed to get my period during last night. I am on the pill so it's extremely accurate and always predictable. I take it on time and exactly as it should be taken. When I don't get it this morning I hit google. Many posts with anecdotal evidence of women with disrupted cycles after quit. However, I decide that these women are most likely not on the pill, my hormones are somehow different since they are from an outside source and I must be pregnant. Pills have failed me or my bf's sperm evolved to outmaneuver them or something 😂😂 I even spin my thoughts into a conclusion that this pregnancy must be the reason why my cravings are way less then the first time I quit 😁😂 I managed to freak my bf out too. I even bought a test but then decided I'm too afraid to do it before next Wednesday (he comes back then - he's away temporary) since I'm already beyond help for a morning-after pill 😂😂 This quit made me into a crazy woman, cravings are not the problem, lack of sleep and weird behaviour and even weirder thoughts are. Luckily, i got my period around 6pm. I was even margianlly proud for quitting for that hypothetical baby even though I have no clue what would I do if I was actually preggo. When I eventually do have a kid, I'm glad it would be raised by non-smokers.

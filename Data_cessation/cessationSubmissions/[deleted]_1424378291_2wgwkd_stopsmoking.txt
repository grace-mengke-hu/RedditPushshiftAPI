I will have my last smoke today and I'm scared.

Today is my quit day. I started out excited about it, but as the day goes on, I've gone from nervous to scared. I'm afraid of the craving that I know will hit at 11 p.m. - when I usually go out for a cigarette all alone, while my family sleeps. I'm scared of continuing to smoke, I'm afraid of cancer and all the other risks I know I've taken by smoking these last many, many years. I'm going to need help to fend off that craving. My strategy is to try and exercise when it hits, then run to bed and hope I fall asleep before the next one.

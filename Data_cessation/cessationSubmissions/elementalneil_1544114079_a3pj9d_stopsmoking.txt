I'm in college, and I just picked up this habit. It helps with my stress.

But, I don't want to continue with this, my father died when I was 5. He had lung cancer, he used to smoke cartloads of cigarettes. 

The stress, though, is huge - I think anyone who went through college will relate. I just need a bit of motivation to quit.

Anyway, I wanna hear how you guys kicked the habit, and how you handled the stress.

1000 days ago I decided to stop for a while.

I didn't do it for any particular reason, or to mark any kind of occasion.  I didn't tell anyone I was quitting.  It was more like when you were a kid and you tried to see how long you could hold your breath.  That's about how long I thought I'd last.  I never imagined this.  1000 days.

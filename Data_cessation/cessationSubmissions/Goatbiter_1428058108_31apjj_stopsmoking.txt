Checking in. Quit after almost 25 years of smoking.

I followed the Allen Carr method.  It was easy.  Before I quit, I was smoking a minimum of 2 packs of Marlboro reds a day, much more if I was drinking.  I'd tried to quit many times before but always went back after a couple of weeks or months.  Read Allen Carr, quit cold turkey, no problems, no cravings after the second day.  I did it, my life is better as a result, and you can do it too.  Although I paid for the kindle copy of Carr's book, if money is tight you can find it for free via piratebay.se .

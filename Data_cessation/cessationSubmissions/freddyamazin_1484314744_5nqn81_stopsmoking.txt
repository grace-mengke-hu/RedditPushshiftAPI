Failed after 18 months... here we go again!

I regrettably started smoking again after 18 months (I smoked for 5 years prior to quitting). It was so nice being an non-smoker, being able to do things I enjoy without the constant thought about my next cigarette, being able to exercise, live a healthy lifestyle, feel better mentally, etc.

I'm determined to quit again! Currently, I'm approaching 22 hours cold turkey, while I'm experiencing some quite horrible side effects, I know I'll be through the worst of it in the next few days. Here's to being a non-smoker again, hopefully forever this time! 

I hope everyone else's quit is going well, keep at it! And to anyone who is considering quitting, if you can get through the first few days cold turkey, you'll already be through the worst of it, good luck! :)

Update: Witnessing some horrid side effects right now, but approaching 44 hours smoke-free! These side effects are only making me want to quit even more... cigarettes are the reason for feeling this way, they're not helping me at all. Good-bye cancer sticks :-)

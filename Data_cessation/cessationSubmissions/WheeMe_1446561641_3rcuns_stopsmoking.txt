Relapses.

I'm fine as long as it's impossible to smoke ie. in school or at work. The hard part is being at home and not smoking.

It's so freaking annoying to find myself having a puff. It's like something clicks and I'm at it again. Why am I doing this to me? Each smoke gets me back to square one and it freaking sucks.

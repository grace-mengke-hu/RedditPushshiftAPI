When will everything stop enraging me?

I quit 3 weeks ago.  I occasionally use the gum or an e cigarette.  It's probably once per day.  Everything fills me with intense rage.  Even things that logically should not.  I'm also very, very depressed.  Do you guys think this is due to the nicotine withdrawals or a mental health issue?  I do have a diagnosis of bipolar 2, but the medication was working well before I stopped smoking.  I don't want to feel like this.

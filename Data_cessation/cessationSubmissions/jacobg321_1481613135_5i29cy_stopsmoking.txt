A short story about beating cravings

Hey everyone. Happy quitting and I hope you're all doing well and breathing better. Just wanted to share a short story I wrote that I hope might help some of you. It's about an intense craving that I recently overcame, one that nearly kicked my ass. It's a quick read, only about 600 words. Enjoy.

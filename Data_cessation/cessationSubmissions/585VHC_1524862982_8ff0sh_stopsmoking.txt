Chronic Recidivism

Hi guys, new to reddit, came here for this group.

I can't seem to get past 36 hours before everything I've read and all the advice melts away and the addicted parts of my brain overpower my weak will. I'm 45 and I've been smoking between 1\-2 packs a day since I was 18 and have tried to quit at least a hundred times in the past few years. I'm searching for a job right now, and being a smoker is not the benign vice as far as employment marketability as in times past. I need to be off \*nicotine\* for health reasons related to circulation due to a current progressing health issue with three fingers on each hand being numb that is eluding diagnosis, and I live with burn survivors who can't have any sort of particulate in the air, so vaping is right out of the question. 

I guess what I'm looking for are stories from people like me who've had to resort to more extreme forms of behavior control. Some steps I've already put in place are getting rid of my car and limiting my job search to walking distance, buying a house that's more than 10 minutes away from anywhere I could buy cigarettes, putting my money in places where it is so illiquid that I wouldn't even be able to access it if I'm hungry and need food, terminating all contact with friends who smoke until I'm quit, and I've just had another cigarette because a vinyl window salesman came to the door with some in his shirt pocket\- there is now a "no solicitors" and "beware of large dog" sign in my yard...

What are some more extreme forms of behavior control that you have taken that have helped that I might add to my quit?

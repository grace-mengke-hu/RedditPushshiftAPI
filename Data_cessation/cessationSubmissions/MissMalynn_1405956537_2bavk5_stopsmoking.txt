To whoever recommended walking when I posted about 2 weeks ago..

THANK YOU! Whoever you were, you freaking rock! That was the thing I needed!
I have the Samsung Galaxy S4, so it automatically comes with S-Health on it, and I love being able to monitor how many steps I took, how fast I am running, how far I went... I LOVE IT! (My shins hurt like hell, LOL, but I'd rather that than hacking up black crap)
I also downloaded QuitNow, an app that monitors your health since not smoking, how many cigarettes I haven't smoked, all my health details - like my CO2 levels and my risk of sudden death (along with alot of other SWEET details)

So, again - a HUGE thank you to whoever in the world suggested this. You are literally a life-saver!

Day 5

I hit my 5th day at 730 this evening. Every time I am tempted to smoke I think of how I would barely be able to fall asleep at night without losing my breath.

On Day 2 I ended up getting a cig, holding it in my mouth while searching a lighter, and as I rationalized why I needed it, I flipped script and started calling myself out for being a punk and not owning up my responsibility to resist triggers. Not letting myself use triggers as an excuse but as a rage inciter against cigarettes has made it a lot easier to manage.

Dropping the Patches - Much tougher than expected.

I'm concerned I may have set myself up for a long hard road to recovery here. I 'quit' smoking cigarettes/ vaping almost 6/7months ago by going on the patch. It wasn't exactly quitting as I would often continue to smoke while drinking but would always go back to patches the next day. 

I struggled for months to wean off the patches for months and have finally succeeded in getting off them completely for the last 8 days. I should be past the worst of the withdrawals by now, but still find myself very depressed, fuzzy headed and anxious. 

Just wondering if anyone has experienced the same depression after dropping patches, or has any tips to help me out. 

Cheers

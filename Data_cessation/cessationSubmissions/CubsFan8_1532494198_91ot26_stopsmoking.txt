Quit in February. Back in restaurant business and have been craving every night after work.

I quit smoking in the middle of February of this year and I also quit drinking July 1st as well as quit smoking cannabis on the 15th of this month.  I am now 100 percent sober. I recently found myself back in the restaurant business serving tables and have been craving a cigarette like crazy these past 5-6 nights every single night.  Somehow I got home tonight without buying a pack and I cannot get it off of my mind. So many people on the staff smoke so cravings are out of this world not being able to light up after work. I just want a damn cigarette man. I feel like Iâ€™m going to have these intense cravings every night now and idk what to do. I feel like my brain just wants some kind of pleasure and the last thing I need right now is a drinking relapse.

1 year!! I'm here to share my tips.

quitting smoking was a little difficult, but it was easy and rewarding every single day i stayed quit. i quit cold turkey.

the best advice i can give you, is think of your smoking habit as NOTHING MORE than a nail biting habit or oral fixation, NOT AN ADDICTION. its hard beating an addiction, but Its easy to keep your hand away from your mouth, think of it like that. keep your mouth busy with lots of water, and cut up ginger. treat yourself often. start fresh from the morning, dont try to quit mid day. 

after 1 whole day, you've got it from there.

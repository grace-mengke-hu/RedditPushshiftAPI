To all you who are worried it never gets easier.

I've been quit smoking for 173 days now.  I smoked for 12 years about a pack a day.  The first little while was tough, and I have tried many times before to quit, and had failed.  This time I succeeded.  Smoking used to be the first thing I did when I woke up, and the last thing I did before I went to sleep.  If you are worried that you will always be thinking about it 24 hours a day, and always want to have one after you've stopped, don't worry.  After 173 days, I only even think about smoking occasionally.  It doesn't cross my mind when I wake up, nor when I go to sleep.  Some people at work smoke, and it doesn't bother me.  Actually it gives me a headache now, but it doesn't make me want to smoke.  It gets easier.  I'd say the thought to smoke doesn't entirely go away, but you certainly don't think about it nearly as much as you do now.  Just fight through it.  You'll get there, I promise.  Good luck everyone here~!

I think I can finally honestly say I quit.

I've been an off again on again smoker since I was 13-14. I tended to relapse and smoke whenever I get stressed,and I've been pretty stressed the last few months. So I was smoking relatively heavily, 1 and a half to 2 packs a day. I quit again last month,  and I've stayed away from cigarettes for about that long. 
Today I got a bit more stressed than usual so I bought a pack,  and I just smoked one cigarette. And it just disgusted me. I threw away the rest of the pack,  and I don't have any craving to smoke anymore. I honestly think that was my last one. 

Sorry if this was badly written. This is mostly so I have something on record for myself so I can be a bit more accountable if I feel the urge to smoke in the future.

I found out that all of my fears were...just...fears

Guys, it's only as hard as we make it. 40 days gone, I can take a cigarette, put it on my lips and won't even think about light it up. Constantly living with smokers.

Quit, please. After quitting I understood why I was smoking, what holes were filled by that smoke. But...was just smoke, so the holes remained open. Now I know what was missing and I can move on with my life. It won't happen overnight and everyone of us is different, so I don't know what will work for you, but I can garantee you that you won't regret this choice. Show yourself who is in control of your life.

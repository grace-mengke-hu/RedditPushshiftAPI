On day two! I need to feel healthy again.

I have been at a about 7 cigs a day and up to a pack a night when I would go out to the bars. I used to be very active, but for the last few years(about 5) i have let it control me not anymore. Wish me luck, I work a hectic weekend at a high volume resturant :)  .Ill keep ya'll posted.

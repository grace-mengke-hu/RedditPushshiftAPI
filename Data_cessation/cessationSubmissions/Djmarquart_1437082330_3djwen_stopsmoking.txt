My reason for 1 year smoke free

[](http://i.imgur.com/fKhQAW4.jpg)I wanted to post this two days ago, on my 1 year date, but I didn't get around to it.

This is my son, Connor, and the 14th marked 1 year from the day we brought him home from the hospital, and the last day that I smoked a cigarette.

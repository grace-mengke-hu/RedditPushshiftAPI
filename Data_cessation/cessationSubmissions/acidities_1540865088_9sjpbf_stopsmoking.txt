A Personal Reminder

*The hardest part about quitting for me is the fact that personally, I don’t actually want to. I’ve been smoking on and off for about eight years, and the most effective way for me to quit for extended periods of time is when the people I date tell me not to. I stopped cold turkey about a month ago after requesting the person I had started dating to tell me to stop, but after recently being dumped by said person, I immediately went back to it. It’s been hard to come out of that relapse, but I’m hoping posting this as accountability will help me commit to quitting for the first time without external inspiration*

You really wanted a cigarette today. It was mostly because you were bored and didn’t know what else to do with yourself. 

Since you’re still grieving or whatever, you let yourself have one. Well, guess what:

**It wasn’t worth it.**

Sure, the initial inhale was great and the release was nice, but after the second or third drag, it was gross. 

It tasted disgusting. It made your mouth dry and you wanted to gag. You couldn’t even finish the entire thing. 

Your breath now stinks. Your clothes now stink. Even though you smoked it outside, your bed now stinks. 

The menthol wasn’t even that cool and refreshing. If you want a minty taste, go chew a piece of gum instead.

The action of smoking may have felt nice for all of ten seconds, but you didn’t feel better after. The nicotine gave you a headache. 

You regretted it after. Now that you’re no longer accustomed to it, it’s actually really, really, not enjoyable. Don’t let yourself become re-accustomed to it.

Next time you want a cigarette, remember you don’t actually want a cigarette, you just want to smoke. 

It’s not worth it.

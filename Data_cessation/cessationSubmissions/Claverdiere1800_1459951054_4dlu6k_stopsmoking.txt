6 months smoke free

6 months smoke free today, the anticipation of quitting was the thing that kept me smoking for so long. I didn't think I could live my life without cigarettes. So after 20yrs and a half dozen failed attempts it finally took. I feel a lot better, smell better (questionable) and I'm not selfishly hiding from my family to feed my habit. I quit cold turkey, bought some sugar free lollipops for when I was driving and a few packs of regular chewing gum also keeping myself busy so if urges came on I would try to put the thoughts out of my mind. I knew that 6 months ago was my time to quit. When it's your time to quit you can do it too. I've heard this before and it rings true "it can't just be a good idea, you have to really want to do it" Set your mind to it and it can be done. I'll probably check back at 1yr just for fun. I have had inspiration from the Reddit community so thank you and good luck.

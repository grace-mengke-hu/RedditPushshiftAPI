Quit with Allen Carr's book then re-started

I quit using Allen Carr's easyway for about a month, then started again, I am back in the thick of being a smoker. I have heard it said that Easyway only works once. Has anyone successfully retrained themselves to be a nonsmoker using the book? Any advice on making it work a second time to get back on track?

Allen Carr's Easy Way To Stop Smoking

This is my story of how I've now been smoke free for 3 weeks, thanks to the book in the title.  
  
A bit of backstory first I guess. Im 25, and I've been smoking for 7 years. Sometimes as much as a pack a day, or as little as 10. It's fluctuated with other circumstances in my life. At about age 22 I was in a very bad place mentally. I was smoking a lot of weed (daily), I was depressed, pushing past a pack a day of cigarettes and was actually showing up to work about 8 days out of my 10 day fortnight. I was overwight quite badly and had a very low self-esteem.  
  
I got rejected by another girl and said enough is enough. I started going to the gym, 4 days a week, lost 25kgs and gained a bit of self confidence. Tried another girl and got rejected again, this would have been about age 23.  
  
I decided that the weed was bad for me (which it was, I was a delusional paranoid wreck.) So again, I said enough is enough, and I gave it up.  
  
Which brings me to my last vice. I tried for 2 years to stop smoking, never lasting more than a day. I thought I'd never quit. I read Allan Carr's book and boom. Haven't had a smoke in 3 weeks, couldn't give a fuck if I never have one again. I've finally cleaned up my act and you can do the same.  
  
It's all about mindset. It doesn't matter if you read the book, go on the patch, go cold turkey. You just have to want to quit, and every time you get a craving, you just laugh and tell yourself "oh, but I don't smoke anymore."  
  
After trying and failing over and over, this book was what finally put me in the right mindset to quit, and to others in the same boat, it's a great read. While i reccomend supporting the author, the book can be found in PDF form quite easily too.  
  
TL;DR  
Smoked for ages, read the book, quit. You should too.  
  
GOOD LUCK!

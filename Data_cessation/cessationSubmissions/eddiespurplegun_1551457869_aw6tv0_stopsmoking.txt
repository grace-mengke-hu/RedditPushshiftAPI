Thoughts on quitting and restless leg?

I'm not sure how to start this off so I'll just ask. How many of you have suffered with restless leg after quitting smoking?
I had my last cigarette a week ago (was drinking) but have stopping smoking consistently since mid December. I was a fairly light smoker at under 10 a day but I guess that's all relative really.
I feel like I've been having restless leg for roughly a month now and usually it's just feeling the need to stretch when I get into bed. I have always slept through the night without any issues, except tonight and it sucks.
Any advice? Should I look into medication or wait this out?
Thanks everyone. I'm real proud of everyone who has subbed here. It's a tough journey for sure but I believe in all of you!

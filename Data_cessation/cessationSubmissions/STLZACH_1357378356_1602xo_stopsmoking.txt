Question for those that have quit, please, I need your help Reddit

I've been having these symptoms since Christmas, and I went to the ER because of them. The doctors did tests and x-rays and told me I was fine. I followed up with my regular physician and he said the same, except prescribed me with anti-anxiety medication.I went from a pack every 1-3 days for about 5 years to 1-2 cigarette(s) a day about a week before Christmas. I also smoke marijuana and have continued to do so, except I cut down quite a bit once the symptoms popped up. Before, it was an every day thing, and I've smoked 3-4 times since. Christmas Eve was the last time I had a cigarette. I'm starting to think that I'm having these symptoms because I quit and my body is recovering, and I'd like to know if anyone else has experienced any of these. *NOTE: I now have NO desire to smoke cigarettes whatsoever. It doesn't even sound appealing. I don't ever think about wanting to smoke and even when I'm talking about it now I have no urges or desires to smoke. All of my friends smoke, and when I say all I mean all, and even seeing them smoke doesn't make me want one. I feel like quitting is going to be a breeze for me if I can just get through these symptoms (assuming they are related)*


**My Symtoms:**

- Constipation

- Desire to take deep breaths occasionally

- Lots of gas, mostly burping.

- Fart sounds coming from my stomach area... not too sure about this one

- Shortness in breath 

- Random sharp pains in upper body area (never lasting more than a second or two)

- EXTREME anxiety and depression, thoughts of death of loved ones and how I will cope when it happens. I've never had any thoughts like this before. This is really what I'm struggling with most. I can handle physical problems but emotions are very hard on me. 
 
- It also almost feels like my lungs are expanding into my ribcage when I inhale.

- Woke up this morning in cold sweats with bad stomach ache and constipation. Today was the first day of cold sweats and stomach ache.

Please, I've been struggling with this the last week or two and it's getting to the point that it is consuming me. Any comments are appreciated and I thank everyone in advance.

I started smoking cigs 2 months ago, now Im addicted and wanna quit before it gets out of hand

Hi,
Im a 23 year old male. Generally healthy and fit.
I started smoking in February and to be honest, loved the way it made me feel. I used to smoke a lot of weed and because it got in the way of university I quit...but it kind of turned into a cigarette addiction.  I justified it by telling myself that "cigarettes dont fuck you up" and you can function normally, "I wont get addicted" etc etc.


Before icking up the daily habit, I would smoke here and there maybe 5 times a year or less). So I was kinda naive going in and thought I wont get addicted.

Because I used it to forget weed it got really heavy, really fast.  I smoke little under a pack a day.  And chain smoke a lot. Every morning I love the first cigarette, but after the first one, it looses it's effect and becomes pointless.

It's been about 3 days since my last cigarette, and I have a question about anxiety. Luckily I dont really have any flu like symptoms, or mood swings, as of now. But the anxiety and cold sweats at night are really irritating.  Its almost like a physical feeling, tat shoots down from my neck area.  Imagine dropping an ice cube down your back.  I've felt that anxious feeling for the last 2 days now.  Man I thought weed had bad withdrawal symptoms, was I wrong.

 I just cant live knowing that I have a physical dependance on a drug. So I have to quit. How long do these last given my time being a smoker?

about 15-20 cigs a day everyday for 2 months.

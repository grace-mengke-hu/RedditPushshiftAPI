Really need help Quitting. Not sure if this is the right place to talk about this.

I had been smoking for 8 years, and switched over to vaping. After vaping for a year I switched up to 40mg salt nicotine, and developed asthma. I started vaping around every 3 minutes later on, was running through a full tank twice a day. Yesterday I bought nicotine gum 4mg, and 4mg lozenge. Even going back to back on them it’s doing absolutely nothing for me, and my head feels like it’s going to explode. I’ve quit cigarettes before and it wasn’t anything like this. I keep trying to search for people quitting vape and there’s surprising very little about it- as if no one is trying to quit it. Any support, help, or guidance would be very appreciated.

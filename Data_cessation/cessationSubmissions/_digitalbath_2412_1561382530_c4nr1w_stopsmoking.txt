Quit 7 months ago

I've been scrolling through here for awhile reading almost everything and I must say well done to everyone who has quit and I hope everyone trying to succeeds in their efforts.

I'm 18 years old, I started smoking when I was 12 due to peer pressure and rapidly my addiction developed, this caused so many arguments with my family. Over the years I had gone through a lot in terms of mental illness (I have BPD) and all I thought that helped was cigarettes and other things that I will let you come up with cause I'm rather ashamed. 

A year and a bit ago I met my boyfriend, a non-smoker and he helped push me to quit, when I say push I don't mean he forced me but he made me realise I needed to. I tried quitting cold turkey but it didn't help, so I searched online and found Allen Carrs book on how to quit permanently. It helped me a lot. 

7 months on and I haven't smoked any cigarettes, I have been smoking weed with tobacco because my friends do, I'm done with that now though. They're getting texts off me and I'll say I'm done smoking joints. My life really has changed for the better since I quit and I really do hope that anyway who wants to quit gets through it no matter how long it takes because addiction sucks.

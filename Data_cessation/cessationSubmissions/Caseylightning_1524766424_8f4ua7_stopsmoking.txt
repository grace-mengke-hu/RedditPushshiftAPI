Day #16

When I first quit I thought it was going to be way harder.

I smoked almost a pack a day for over 6 years. I thought If I didn’t quit now it would be nearly impossible once I reached the decade point. 

Sure, of course I had some really bad cravings. 
Day #6 was the worst.
I was stressed, anxious and in need of a lean-to. I even went so far as to look for a halfie in my ashtrays and search my house for a lucky left in a pack.
I couldn’t find one and if I did, I would of probably smoked it. I didn’t though and life moved on smoke-free as intended.
I’m so thankful I couldn’t find one.

Day #8 
I went drinking with a friend. We all know smoking and drinking are pretty much besties and go hand in hand. I resisted the urge to bum one while my friend smoked outside.
It was incredibly hard.
I got a frozen banana instead and enjoyed my walk on the beach without that ‘after cig tired feeling.’
I felt accomplished.

Day #10 
I was in the Casino. There is someone smoking everywhere. The cravings were super bad this day. SUPER BAD.
It felt like a boss level in a video game. I chewed my gum sadly and the cravings disappeared fairly quick.

Day #13
Friend was smoking and I stared at him while he did it. It didn’t seem appealing. 

Day #14
2 weeks! I’ve never gone this long. It’s a wonderful feeling. My teeth appear whiter, nails returned color, food tasted better and I have more energy. 

Day #16
I have a long journey ahead with many more obstacles but I feel more confident in staying true to the promise to myself. Everyday it gets easier and it’s extremely rewarding.

I hope sharing my timeline helps give some perspective, motivation to at least one person. Stay strong and choose to live a healthy life.

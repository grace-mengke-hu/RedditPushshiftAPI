Made it through the first 24 hours. So far so good.

After reading this sub for the last month or so, the day finally came. In the last week I've been building up to quitting, and yesterday I watched the Alan Carr DVD due to all of the recommendations here. It really put things into perspective for me and I think it allowed me to get through the first 24 hours of being a non-smoker relatively stress-free. Just wanted to thank all of the awesome people in this sub.

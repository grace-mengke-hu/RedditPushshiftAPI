Just got home from the grocery store. I've got juice, candy, gum, and toothpicks. I just smoked my last cig. 

I hate smoking. I hide it as well as I can from everyone I know.  I've been telling myself I'll quit before I turn 30 so I can say smoking was just a dumb thing from my 20's. I turn 30 in May. I met a girl a month ago and things are going really well. But I always end up making an excuse to head home when all I really want is a cig. She doesn't know I smoke and I'd like to never have that conversation. 

So, today's the day. Moved up my quit date by about 2.5 months. Time to reset my flair and give this another go.

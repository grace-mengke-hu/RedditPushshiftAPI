10 Months Nicotine/Cigarette Free!

Hey all! Was going through my post history and saw that 4 months ago I had replied to a topic saying I was 6 months quit, making me at 10 months now! (I had the Stop Smoking app but my phone reset and never bothered to reinstall the app)


I guess I'll recount the last night I had cigarettes:


I had been struggling with quitting like every smoker does and had been smoking for over 10 years at that point and was smoking a pack a day.


I eventually got really mad at myself for not being able to quit and harnessing that anger at myself is what really pushed me over to quitting. Instead of blaming this or that or any external factor for what "makes me smoke" I turned the blame on myself.


I took the remaining cigarettes I had and put them in a plastic bag then filled it up with water, this would make sure that they were ruined and I wouldn't be able to fish them out of the trash later.


First few days, and weeks, are definitely the hardest. I basically just started eating everything in site and after quitting definitely got to one of my my heaviest weights in my life. I told myself that it was alright though, I would allow myself to eat more and gain weight because my main focus was on quitting cigarettes once and for all.


Now I am 10 months quit and I am in the best shape of my life, excersize regularly (4-5 times per week) and eating healthy. Best of all, no nasty cigarettes!

Keep it up everyone

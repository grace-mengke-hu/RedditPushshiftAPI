On day 6, the cravings seem worse than ever.

I've made it this far and if it wasn't for my mind telling me that I'd of wasted all this suffering for nothing, I'd of had one. I have some in my room, im not going to throw them away because it'll stress me out even more.

I've been working out like a lunatic but it's always been late at night when the cravings are the strongest then I sleep like shit.

At the moment it's work out till I feel absolutely sick and sleep like shit or smoke. So far I haven't smoked but it's getting damn hard.

The best way I can describe this is a constant pressure inside of me that feels like a cigarette a will like a ballon, like a wave of stress just gone but I know I'll of failed. 

I'll probably make it through tonight but if this continues I'll give in.

Day 6 and it sucks.

Quit for 6 months and stumbled. Picking up the pieces again.

I'm a 29 year old male who smoked for about 12 years. I am also asthmatic and couldn't have chosen a worse thing to do to myself. In December I had a near fatal breathing incident due to smoking where I was in a medically induced coma for several days that required intubation. Since, I have had to have several minor surgeries to help me swallow and breath properly since I developed a condition known as stridor. (http://www.healthline.com/symptom/stridor) I have had to go back a number of times to have the scarring in my throat removed/stretched so I can breathe and swallow properly. 

I was living in NJ and had an Uncle who offered to have me live with him under the condition that I find steady work and not smoke. I managed to fulfill my end of the bargain for about 6 months until I recently got a car to myself and in my weakness went and smoked at a bar my Uncle's friends frequent. When they saw me smoking I knew they would tell me Uncle so at that point I decided it would be better if I told him then his friends. When I came clean he said that I had to leave, and he has given me a range of 2 pay periods to leave. I am not currently making a lot of money and it has been very difficult to find somewhere to live. I am trying to find a place in NJ because I am really home sick for the Northeast, but in my desperation am also seeking a room in SC as well out of necessity. 

Once again it has taken everything from me. But this time I had only smoked about 9 cigarettes and started feeling the negative health effects again, so I have not smoked since and would like to think I won't. I'm sort of using this as an off my chest but I just wanted to share my story with someone I might be able to relate to. I wish everyone luck in their quest not to smoke again.

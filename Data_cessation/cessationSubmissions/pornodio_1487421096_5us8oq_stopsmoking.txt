15 hours since last cigarette, already having an existenzial crysis

Now, IÂ´m some heavy addict. I suffer from a very very hard addiction to cigs. I've learned a lot of tricks on how to manage withdrawal and how to recognize symptoms and traps and I'm astonished at how deep can an addict mind go.

So, this morning I felt the typical symptoms of hypoglycemia due to withdrawal, even if I ate / drank juice etc. Those aren't a problem, actually I enjoy the feeling. It's almost like being a little drunk. 

Then went for a run on the Hills here in switzerland where you have very beautiful sights (I'm italian). After the run I guess I happened to have a mix of dopamine depletion due to the sprints and the one due to nicotine withdrawal, so my mind started thinking about how old and ugly I am, and that I'll always  be alone all the time, and how it's normal that nobody likes me, and even if I'm lonely and ugly I can't even excel at my job or even be athletically good. I started thinking about how I fucked up with a girl at my work that I fucked up with, and how I wrote her on facebook and had a small conversation with her and felt only bad because I didn't ask her out when I had the possibility and now I feel cucked. And of course how I will never have sex with a beautiful girl again and, at best, I'll be back with my vampire ex after she had the time of her life so I can be her asexual teddy bear.

So, all of these thoughts are all due to the negativity of being in withdrawal for me. I know it and I just needed to vent the fuck out. Thanks for your time if you like reading a negative bipolar borderline piece of shit spitting his retardedness out.

You don't miss it?

Yesterday after eating with two coworkers, the smoker went out and that bring on the table, the topic of my quitting.

- You don't miss it?

I pointed to the window through we could see our coworker outside under a small roof to protect her self from the rain and bad weather.

- Not a single bit.

Keep strong fellas.

Farewell

This sub has been a great help with tons of super supportive people! I almost hate to say...I don't need to be here anymore. I honestly don't even think about smoking on most days so really at this point all this sub does is pop up and remind me that I used to smoke. I will still be stopping in from time to time, good luck to you all, and I hope to see you again. We can hang out and not smoke together!

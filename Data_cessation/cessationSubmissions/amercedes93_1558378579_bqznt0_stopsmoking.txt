I have no idea HOW to quit. Heard terrible things about chantix.

Mostly all in the title. I have been a smoker since 16 years old, and I turned 26 last week. This has got me SERIOUSLY concerned about my addiction to cigarettes. I never thought I would be smoking 10 years later, when I wanted to 'be the cool kid' at 16. I'm not sure if it helps, but I have some existing anxiety.  I do not take medication for it, as cigarettes have always been my 'go-to' when I'm anxious. My mom had used chantix before, and didn't have any issues, but after reading reviews, I'm terrified to try it.  Another issue is, I've heard that when you quit smoking, you tend to gain weight. I have been dieting since January, and I don't want to take a step back on the progress I've made there...

Any advice? I've heard about a book, but quite honestly, I have 2 young boys, and hardly enough time to keep the laundry up, let alone read  book.

Stopping smoking is like coming off an antidepressant....literally. MAOIs is cig smoke

Hi guys, I heard this a bit and actually found a scientific study involving lab rats.  The study concluded that nicotine alone did not have a high self administer repetitive rate in the rats, compared to nicotine and MAOI additives such as are in the cig smoke.  The nic with the MAOI had a very high repetitive rate for self administration, and this fully and scientifically answered my question about why I've been super depressed about quitting smoking, even though I'm vaping at similar to higher nicotine levels.

I just wanted to share this, because for me, now it feels like a validation of the initial feelings of feeling empty, aside from "it's an addiction".  We all know it is, but the experiment kind of shows that it's like immediately stopping an antidepressant.  MAOIs aren't prescribed that much any more because they f*ck with people so much coming off of them. 

So, for those going beast mode cold turkey, you're awesome and my heros, but if you feel like you're going to fail, don't be afraid of using nicotine replacement therapy if you're at that point where you're on your way to the store buying smokes..that giving up point.

For vapers who feel like they are cheating, don't.  It's a wonderful stepping stone and this study really shows that nicotine addiction is not so bad.  It's all the other stuff in the cigs that make smoking so addictive.  That's why there's so many people who go down in vape juice and are fine, or people i've know who ran out of vape juice and were just mildly antsy.

Anyways, love to all of you and yours, and fight the good fight!  We are DOING THIS!!!! RAWWWWRRR!!! &lt;3

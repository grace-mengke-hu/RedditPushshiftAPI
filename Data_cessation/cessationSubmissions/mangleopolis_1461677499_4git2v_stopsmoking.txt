Over a Year Smoke Free

If it hadn't been for this subreddit, I don't think I would have made it this far. If it hadn't been for this subreddit, I wouldn't have even started. A user here introduced me to Allen Carr's *Easy Way to Quit Smoking* last April, and I quit the same day. A year later, I'm smoke-free, finishing up a grad program, and dating a fantastic girl. I couldn't be happier.

Thanks a thousand times over to all of you.

Freedom from nicotine slavery

I have been smoke free now for 1 month and 7 days. The benefits I have now are more then when  was a smoker. I have more money, better health, complexion, teeth, skin and hair, smell and taste. I'm  more attractive to women,  have more energy to run and go up stairs, more time to focus on myself. I love being away from the slavery and addiction of cigarettes. I know look at smokers and feel sorry for them.

Day 3 and feeling like shit

I've tried quitting before where I made it either a few days or a month, but I've never felt this much physical pain and discomfort that I'm feeling this morning. It's not crippling by any means but it is worrying. I've only been a prisoner of cigarettes for 2.5 years but of course the thought of cancer hovers over my head when I feel shit like this. Have any of you felt something like this when quitting? What were you side effects in the harrowing first week?

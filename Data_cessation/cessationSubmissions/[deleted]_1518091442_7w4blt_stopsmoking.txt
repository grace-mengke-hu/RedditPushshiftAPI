The mood swings are real. How long until they stop?

I quit cold turkey 24 days ago. It's been surprisingly easy but damn... the mood swings are brutal. Past few days I was feeling literally suicidal and today I'm almost optimistic. It's really crazy and disturbing.

I've always had an history of depression though so I'm not sure if that's caused by the withdrawal but anyhow how long does it usually take for the brain to stabilize?

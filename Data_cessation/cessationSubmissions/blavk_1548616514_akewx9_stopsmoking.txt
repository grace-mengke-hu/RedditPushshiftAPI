I put a bet and I hope I’ll win it

I just made two bets with my cousin, one that I’ll stop smoking, the other that I’ll start going to the gym. If I win both I would stop a bad habit and learn a new one.   If I lose I would also lose 200 euros. The bet starts tomorrow. Wish me luck! Also I would like some tips for the days that I may lose some of my motivation, if you have any I would gladly hear it

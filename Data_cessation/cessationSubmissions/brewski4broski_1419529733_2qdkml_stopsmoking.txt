Stop right now

Not next week. Not after The New year.


Just stop right now. It's the perfect time. Chances are many of you will be hanging out with family & friends later on today (if not right now). Start talking to the family/friends who don't smoke. Make conversation with them, and spend more of your time with them. observe how they don't NEED to smoke.

If you can get through today, everything else will be easy. New Year Eve falls in the middle of the week, so chances are you don't have any big plans, right? EVEN BETTER.

All signs are pointing for you to stop right now. If you are just reading this forum and thinking about it, stop thinking & do it.

In 4 months, spring will arrive. The weather will get better & you'll be way past cravings & wanting to smoke. You can enjoy all outdoor activities this year smoke free and won't be craving it at all. 

There's no time like right this second to stop.

best of luck, you can do it.

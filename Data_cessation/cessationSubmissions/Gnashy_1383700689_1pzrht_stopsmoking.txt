Any other long*ish* term quitters experiencing this?

I love having quit smoking.  Love it.  For anyone who is new to quitting and is reading this, do not be discouraged.  I do not for a second regret quitting.  
But now that that is out of the way, I am having a weird resurgence of  a problem I kind of had when first starting up with the quitting.  I am not craving nicotine but at all times I want to be eating, drinking, or otherwise consuming ... something (yep, now would be a great time for a dick joke).  I can tell I'm gaining weight and I would rather not do that, but I just can't get away from that nagging feeling that I'm hungry, especially for food that is not particularly healthy.  I do get quite a lot of excersize, but have been since before quitting and as a result, eating more *is* causing a weight gain.

Has anyone else had this problem this late in the quitting process? What did you do?

Give it or smoke it

OK guys so I tried to stop smoking yesterday and I just bought a new Marlboro pack (20 cigarettes). I smoked one but now I feel bad. First solution is to finish it or 2nd option is to give it to a homeless  man with my 2 lighters (I'm outside now thinking about what is the best solution) What is the best solution? I don't wanna throw it because I just bought it, what can I do? 🙁

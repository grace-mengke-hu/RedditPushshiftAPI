Feeling it

The nostalgia of quitting is gone, most of the fear and the anxiety. I still have cravings but they are less frequent and less powerful. I feel proud of myself, but not so much that I'm not watching out for pitfalls. It just feels good to be doing right by myself and my body. 

Life is short. Life is precious. I can do this. You can do this too!

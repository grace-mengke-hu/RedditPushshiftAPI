Monday is my quit day.

I'm a little nervous, but I am so ready to quit. I have been a smoker for almost 12 years now, and I just hate it. The smell, the taste, the way it makes my mouth feel, I hate all of it. My 7 year old daughter asks me to quit regularly. I have tried to quit in the past, and the farthest that I ever got was 3 days. I wasn't really ready to quit then, though. This time, I am ready. I would really appreciate some tips or tricks if possible. Any advice is welcome. Thanks so much. Oh, I guess I should tell you that I am quitting cold turkey. I don't really want to use a patch or a pill. Just personal preference.

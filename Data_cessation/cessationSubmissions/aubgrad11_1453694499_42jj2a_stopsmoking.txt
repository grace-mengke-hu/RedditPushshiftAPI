So I guess it's been half a year...

I honestly don't even remember how bad it was. I'm now six months without a cigarette, and three without any nicotine replacement.

I can't even imagine my life with cigarettes anymore...it seems so distant. I didn't realize it had been 6 months because I haven't even thought about it.

I'm drinking right now and usually would be needing a cig badly. But here I am happy as can be without nicotine. Cheers.

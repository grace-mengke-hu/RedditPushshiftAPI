No matter how positive you want to stay, there will be conflict and stress every day of your life.

That's the main thing I need to keep in mind. As soon as I have an argument or get bad news my brain instantly tells me I need to buy a pack and try quitting again in a day or two. You can't quit smoking by avoiding all the stressors in your life. It's like as soon as I have something negative occur in my life, my mind perks up and just starts becoming happy that it has a reason to smoke again. As if the conflict is more important than quitting.

Help! Has anyone else experienced this?

Im (25F) off of nicotine completely for appx 9 days. I’ve been having a burning/tightness in my chest and I’m wondering if anyone else has had that. I’m not really thinking it’s cardiac related because...well I’m 25 and have no cardiac history. I have a doctors appointment though anyway. It’s not debilitating just frustrating and noticeable.

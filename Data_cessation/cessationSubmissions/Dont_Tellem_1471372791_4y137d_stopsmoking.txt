On day 2 of no smoking

Cravings are definitely hitting me hard right now. I've been putting off quitting smoking because I'm trying to lose weight and I am really scared that I'm going to gain.

I've read that's it's inevitable and I will really bummed out because I've worked so hard on my diet and exercise to lose the weight that I have lost.

I want to quit to better my health and fitness performance. I also just want to breathe and smell normally.

Is gaining weight really inevitable or can I keep it under control with my diet and exercise plan?

i posted here a while ago. the man/woman who sent me this message has been a redditor for all of five hours. seems like a scam for a 90$/month subscription

>Quitting smoking

>from Docsmoke sent 1 hour ago

>Hey, I read that you quit smoking! Congrats on your decision. My name is Ray and I'm an MD from Cornell. We are creating a new program for smoking cessation that links successful people who have quit smoking to those who want to quit. I was hoping you could answer a couple of questions for us.
Would you pay $3 a day for a mentor who successfully quit smoking who is just like you (ie your age, years youâ€™ve been smoking, packs a day)? They would give you advice and interact with you while you quit, guide you through day to day. Any input would be really beneficial for us.

>Thanks a lot, Ray

whats going on here. this is really not what i came here for

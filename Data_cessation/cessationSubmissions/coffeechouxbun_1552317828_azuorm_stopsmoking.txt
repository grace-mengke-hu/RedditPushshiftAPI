Whatever works for YOU

So many posts being critical of NRT and vaping.
These posts are not helping anybody.

Great, you quit cold turkey and that is to be applauded but this is not the right way for everyone.

I don't mean to be harsh but successfully quitting cold turkey doesn't make you any better than the person next to you who successfully quit with another method.

We need to be encouraging everybody, no matter what method they use to get away from the evil tobacco, the main thing is - is that they do surely.

So well done everyone however you choose to quit.
Your are strong and you can do it.

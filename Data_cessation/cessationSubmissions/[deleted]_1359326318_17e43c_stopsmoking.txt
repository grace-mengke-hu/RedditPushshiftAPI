I've failed

As the title implies, I've failed. 26 days ago I gave up smoking. I had it done. I finally quit for good. Well I thought for good. Today my girlfriend broke up with me and I'm a fucking wreck. This is the worst feeling in the world. I think it's made worse by the fact that I didn't do anything particularly wrong, she's just too busy with school and work and she couldn't be in a relationship anymore. I'm utterly heartbroken. We were only together for a little short of 9 months but it had me crying like a baby. So, on the drive home I couldn't take it anymore. I couldn't handle the pain of her leaving and keep up the good fight at the same time and I bought a pack. I'm not proud of it, I'm not happy about it, in fact I'm rather ashamed of myself but I couldn't stand to struggle with 2 things at the same time. 

Honestly, I don't know if you guys want to know this or even care but it makes me feel tons better to talk about it. I will quit again. I'm not going to give up the good fight, but for the time being my fight has to be focused elsewhere. This sub helped me get farther in my quitting than ever before and I thank you guys dearly. You've been great help but I've let you guys down. I'm sorry guys.

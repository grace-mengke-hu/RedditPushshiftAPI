Has it been 2 days already?

So, all I did was blink, and now it's 2 days later and I've been eating healthier, not smoking, and not rubbing it in people's faces! I realize that every other time I have quit before, I was a pretentious d-bag about it; this time I just don't want to die like my parents, and I want to be able to afford the good life I have ahead of me. 

I'm currently going to school for massage therapy, I love the work I do but I feel like a hypocrite in a profession that advocates a healthy holistic lifestyle and be a smoker who drinks way too much coffee and gets hardly any sleep. 

I put down the smoking and I find myself naturally drawn to healthier foods, yes I have been having little mini sugar binges, but nothing compared to the constant in-flow of junk like when I smoked!

I feel good guys but I do get scared when I get a craving, it isn't just like an "ooo I want one" craving, its a subtle and insidious craving that feels like "OF COURSE it's time for a smoke" like it's a necessary component of my day! it's so strange that my body see's it as if it's a medication that I have to take periodically and something bad would happen if I messed up the timing.

You guys are awesome by the way, I really do feel the love on this sub, btw how do I get the day counter flair???

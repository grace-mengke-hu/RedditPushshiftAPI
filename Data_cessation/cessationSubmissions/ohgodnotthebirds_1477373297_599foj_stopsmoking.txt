Having trouble maintaining my normal motivation while quitting

I've been trying to quit for the last few months and I find it very difficult to keep up with school work and keep up with interests like music and art whenever I'm not smoking. Whenever I've quit, all I've been able to do is durdle around. 

I really do want to stop, but I have so much trouble trying to focus on studying and such. I'm feeling pretty trapped, not being able to function properly without nicotine. Unfortunately, I can never find a good time to stop, exams for my classes are spaced fairly close together this semester. Does anyone have advice for quitting and still maintaining my normal motivation and energy?

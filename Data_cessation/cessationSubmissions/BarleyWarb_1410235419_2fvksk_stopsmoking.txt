The time is never right -- but what's the right time?

I work at a music venue at night and as a writing tutor / writer during the day. Almost every single day. Seriously. There is no "weekend" for me where I can just hole myself up and avoid contact with people. Not to mention, the venue is full of smokers of course, so every night I am surrounded by it (not inside the venue, thankfully, but still a huge pressure). Meanwhile, the tutoring job requires a lot of patience and the writing job requires focus and self-motivation, all of which I know I'll lose for at least a few days while quitting -- this is what happened last time; I could not focus on anything or motivate myself to do much of anything, but luckily I had a rare three-day break (that I orchestrated for that purpose). But I can't afford to miss days right now, and this weekend the one day I AM missing is for my friend's wedding, which I know will be chock-full of alcohol, the deal-breaker for me last time (should have waited a bit longer to drink, knowing that it was a trigger). 

I've been on this sub for about a month now, and today in particular I've really wanted to quit (seeing it as a potential source of a lot of my fatigue and semi-depression) but I'm totally scared of messing up my daytime workflow only to possibly revert again at night or this weekend or something. I know a lot of this is addiction-based excuses, but a lot of it is real too, in that I want to maximize my chances for success while minimizing negative side effects during the quitting process itself.

Any advice for a way-too-busy dude?

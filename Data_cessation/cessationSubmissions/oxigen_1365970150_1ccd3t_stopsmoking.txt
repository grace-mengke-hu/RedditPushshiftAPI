Just hit 28 days. Sometimes it helps to quit out of spite.

Last month I was out drinking and other shenanigans with my girlfriend. Quitting had been on my mind for a long time and I can't remember exactly what I said but I announced that I wanted to quit. Again. My girlfriend scoffed at me in that like-I-haven't-heard-that-before kind of way. And told me that she didn't believe I would do it, so I shouldn't bother trying.

Well what she learned about me that night is that I'm the type of person who really hates the phrase "you can't do that," or "you won't succeed." So I told her I would quit just to spite her and show her I have the willpower to stop. And on top of that we made a deal that if I went 30 days without a smoke, she would quit too.

But a week later she decided she wanted to show me she could drop it cold-turkey as well. Well, last night I met up with her and she was smoking a cigarette! The last of a pack. Tsk, tsk, tsk! But she said she's still holding true to the deal, if I go 30 days, she'll try to quit again.

So I hope she does but I'm glad I've come this far and I have no intention of turning back. I'm done with it!

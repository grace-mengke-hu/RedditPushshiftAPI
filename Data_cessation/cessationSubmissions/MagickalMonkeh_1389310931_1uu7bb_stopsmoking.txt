Just could not quit smoking so now I'm cheating with e-cigs

I've been a hopeless smoking addict for over a decade now. I've quit on countless occasions but the longest I've been without smoking since I was 18 has been 3 months.

I've tried nicotine gum, the nicotine inhalators, but they didn't really help at all. That feeling of 'being without' was too strong, and weak willed as I am, I just got restless and anxious until I was back on the smokes.

Just before Christmas I got an e-cig, you know the sort, they produce a nicotine vapor. I have to say it really works for me - it took about 2 weeks to wean myself of cigarettes even with this, but haven't had one now for a month, and mentally it feels as if I've not quit. Physically though, the effects are starting to show now. First of all was the return of my sense of smell and taste - particularly how horrible people smell for 5 minutes or so after they've just smoked outside and come back into the office.

Eventually I hope to give up the e-cig, but even if I don't, I'm so much happier that I'm no longer at the mercy of tobacco and all its obvious health hazards.

In some ways it feels like I'm cheating, but to anyone out there who is feeling in despair at their inability to quit smoking like I was, seriously give an e-cig a try.

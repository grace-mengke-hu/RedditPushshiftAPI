Living with smokers and wanting to quit.

Has anyone went through a similar situation? I live with my parents and they smoke. I don't even need to ask they just let me take because we've all been smoking together for years. Now i'be wanted to quit for a while and its like i cant get away from it! All i have to do is walk a couple steps and they're there! I've tried telling them they want to quit but in reality, it's like one junkie asking another to help them kick their habits. Any advice?

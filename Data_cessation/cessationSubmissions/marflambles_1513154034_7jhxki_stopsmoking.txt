Help drastically reduce cravings by employing simple techniques developed by Pavlov

Hello all, keep fighting the good fight. I have had noticeable success by using a simple rubber band trick where every time I got a craving or saw a cigarette in general I would snap the band harder depending on how big the craving was. It took about 12 days of this but now I don’t even wear it because my cravings are basically 0. If things have been tough and you have been craving may be self harm is the answer! At least a rubber band won’t give you COPD.

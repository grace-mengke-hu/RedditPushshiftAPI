Quitting for a Baby. Not even my own!

My roommate just became a father. He and I are going to quit smoking so we don't stink and have smoke around the house that his daughter can breathe. We also work together, and a couple co-workers said they'd join in on this as well. I'm really excited about this group effort we're doing. yesterday I finished my pack and I'm now (counting sleep) 12 hours without a cigarette. I have tried many times in the past before, as we all have, but I hope this time I can quit for good; if not for me, for little baby Annie.

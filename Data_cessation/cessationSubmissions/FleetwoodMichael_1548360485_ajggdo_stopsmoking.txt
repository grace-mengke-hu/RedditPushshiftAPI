Hi there.

My name is Michael, I’m 26 years old, and today is the first day of me quitting cigarettes. I’ve been smoking since I was fifteen, and have tried to quit numerous times to no avail. I found this sub on accident and really liked the community. Ended up downloading the Smoke Free App to chart my progress and keep me motivated, wish me luck guys!! Lurking here the past couple days has given me the courage to take this step.

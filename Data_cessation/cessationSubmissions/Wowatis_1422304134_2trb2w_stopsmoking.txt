Today is the day..

I have been a smoker for 4 years, it hasn't been that long compared to other people but I find it is going to be just as hard. Cold turkey, I have tried many times and no success so far but today I am not going to smoke ever again. Any support or tips to breaking the habit of picking one up would be greatly appreciated.. :( thank you

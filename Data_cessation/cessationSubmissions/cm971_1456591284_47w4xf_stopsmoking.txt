Gonna do it this time!!

I've been trying to quit smoking for at least a year now. The best I've done is going 2 or 3 weeks without having a cigarette but then I'll end up having one on a night out and then that leads to finishing off the pack the next day and before I know it I'm back smoking. But I hate the feeling of guilt and I'm tired of  how smoking makes me feel. I wanna be able to run up a stairs and not feel out of breath, feel more energetic and healthy! Today is the day that I actually quit and quit for good! Anyone out there thinking or trying to quit today I wish you luck!!

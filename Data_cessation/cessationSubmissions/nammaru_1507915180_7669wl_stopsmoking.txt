I am becoming complacent and careless.

A cold turkey quitter here. I can't believe it's been this long since without a cigarette. Self-respect. 

My cravings are still here and yesterday night, had a really bad one. But for the most part, the cravings are largely muted and feels like the television blaring in the background like white noise. 

I feel in control...or am I?

This morning, I woke up thinking about how I don't crave cigarettes. But thinking of cigarettes naturally made me want one. I showered, I shaved, threw on my clothes for work. Grabbed my sports coat, checked my pockets for keys, my wallet and my phone. And then I kept checking for something else. 

My cigarettes. 

It's a strange feeling trying to find my cigarettes when I don't smoke them anymore. 

I think it's because I'm used to feeling victorious. I've settled that I am not a smoker. My mind is assuming victory when the battle is still to be fought. 

I think I'm back on my toes. Alert and cautious not to have another puff.

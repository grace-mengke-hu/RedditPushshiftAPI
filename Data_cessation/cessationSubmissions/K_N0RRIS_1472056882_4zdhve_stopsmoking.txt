Day 1. Me 2.0

Hey everyone. So today is my 1st day as a non smoker. I'm 26 and Ive been smoking newports for the past 5 years. Half a pack a day.

I made the decision and commitment based on a couple reasons. Firstly, i had a devastating breakup with my girlfriend of 11 months. We were madly in love the first 5 months but things changed around March. I realized that I had gotten complacent in our relationship and she grew unattracted to me. She also hated my smoking. I gained a ton of weight. Even still I treated her like gold when she treated me like an option. So the inevitable happened. I got tired of chasing and pleading for her to want to be with me and i ended the relationship for good yesterday (on a good note). 

In the past month, Ive worked out 6 days a week, changed my diet, and dropped 15 lbs. Ive always flirted with the idea of quitting smoking but it seemed unrealistic. That is until I realized how much of a better person I could become. Then my mother told me she could get me nicotine patches to help but only if I was really ready. Well today I am. I put it on this morning and Im 13 hours no cigarette. The craving is still there a little bit. But I feel great about myself. I hope to keep it up.

I want to become a better version of myself. Get this promotion at my job and eventually go back to school and earn my bachelors degree. I joined this subreddit since all I do at work is answer phones, be a secretary and reddit anyways and the support here looks phenomenal.

So stoked!!! 30 days!!!! SFS (smoke free Sept.) was a success!!

I thought I could make it here ... but I didn't know I could! 30 days!!!!

Just giving myself a huge pat on the back for breakin a month!!! :D

I was in lots of situations over this month where I had no idea I could say "no" and I still stuck too it!

If you are reading this and thinking about quiting, just do it. you don't need anyone to quit with you ... my GF still smokes, my friends smoke, my coworkers .... you will just be their inspiration. I've already vicariously inspired 2 other friends to quit! 

My reasoning was purely $$$ based .... health was in a far second place (I live in Southern Ontario .... shit is over $10 a pack!)

But!!! health wise: my workouts have got more effective (higher reps, an extra set, etc.), my running has gone through the roof .... I can just .... keep going now ... without that shitty acid taste in the back of my throat and tight chested feeling.

I didn't read the book everyone talks about on here. I would have been good just to keep busy and motivated.

the first week is hell. (day 4 and 5 I literally cried)
after that its breaking routine.

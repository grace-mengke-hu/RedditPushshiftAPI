Skinny guys who managed to gain weight after quitting?

Hey everyone :) 
22M I am currently 2 days smoke free after smoking 20 cigs a day for 8-9 years...
The cravings are pretty strong so i came here to look for motivation.
I always was very skinny (140lbs 5'11)
Im working out and trying to eat as much as i can but it is very hard for me.
Is there anyone who been there and quitting helped them gain weight?

Ready to quit now

I quit smoking at the start of 2018, lasted a month. I fell for it when I was drinking alcohol, loads of tequila and beers weren't the brightest idea afterall. I'm glad I have an experience though:

Playing with a straw or stick biscuits in the first week are surprisingly great

Walking for long distances

Not hanging out with any smokers in the first week

Affirmations

Reading a note I wrote myself before quitting, of how decading smoking is and how I felt about it emotionally.

Remind myself that, eventually, I'm gonna hate the whole thing.

In 5 years I would have an extra 12,000$ in my pocket

The demons inside you will always try to convince you it's only one cigarette

Everyone noticed how I smelled very good, brightened face too

Wim Hoff experience started to feel real

Started running

And all the juicy stuff. WHY THE HELL WOULD ANYONE WANNA TOSS ALL THAT AWAY

Let's bloody do this!!

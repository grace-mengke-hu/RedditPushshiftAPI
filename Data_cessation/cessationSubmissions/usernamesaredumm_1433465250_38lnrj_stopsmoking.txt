Smoking in the car.

I had my last cigarette on May 11th and for the first few weeks everything was fine. I barely had any cravings and I generally forgot about smoking...unless I was in the car. My husband smokes and both of us would light up right away when we drove somewhere. Now that I've quit, the smoke from his cigarettes and the smell of his car is overwhelming. Is there a way to have us both be respectful of each other in such a closed space.

Also, he's almost ready to quit, too. Fingers crossed.

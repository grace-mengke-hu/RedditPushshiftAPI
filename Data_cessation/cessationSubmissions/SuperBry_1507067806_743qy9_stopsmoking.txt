Day 1, so far a success.

I started smoking when I was 16, it was mostly a social thing but did find my self quickly addicted. About nine years later when my second daughter was born I knew it was my time to stop.  I took chantix (worked great at the time, had some crazy dreams and unimaginable gas but didn't go psycho) and was able to drop them like they were nothing.

A little under a year ago I found out the love of my life, my wife had an affair. I kinda went down a dark path started drinking heavily and with it picked up smoking again from my bar-friends. 

Its been a wild year, some good some bad. Filing for divorce, started seeing a therapist, getting kicked out of my house, worked on some other unhealthy habits and just tried to be the best SuperBry I could be but quitting smoking just wasn't a priority for me. I had a physical a few weeks ago, asked for chantix again and here I am one day not smoking.

Here's to many more and good luck to the rest of y'all on your journeys.

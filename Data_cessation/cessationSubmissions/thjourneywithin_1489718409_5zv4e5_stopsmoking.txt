Survivorship Bias: Did anyone read David Carrs book and find it DIDN'T work for them?

I was a smoker in my teens and was able to quit (cold turkey) after finishing grad school. After almost 10 blissful years of being a non-smoker, I started back up again because of social smoking while going out with friends. It's been a few months and I want to quit again so I joined this sub. After reading so many stories about how Carr's book helped, I decided to read it. 

I mentioned this to a non-smoker boyfriend who is otherwise totally supportive. He suggested that I might be listening to the biased opinion of ONLY the people who were helped by the book and not all the others who read it and still failed. He called this 'survivorship bias'. 

It made me curious. I'm still going to try the book, and follow the plan, but how many out there found that book unhelpful or just another gimmick?

Smoker vs ex smoker

* ex smoker: tonight I can hit the gym even if tomorrow I have a shitty day at work,  I have more energy so I won't feel very tired afterwards; I can enjoy the endorphins and be fit.
* ex smoker: yesterday I went to place X to do Y and, unexpectedly, I really had fun and met wonderful people; I did not feel like going but I tried instead of staying always in the same boring pub. When I smoked it was OK but now I need to try doing more interesting things to avoid boredom. 
* ex smoker: I am a bit anxious lately, well, at least I do not have to worry about the consequences of smoking,  I have already taken care of that. I feel I am clean, it is easier to love myself without this self-destructive addiction.
*smoker: smoking is nasty but I have to do it to put up with all the shit that keeps happening.
* ex smoker: wow, I never realized that for many girls it's a big turndown if somebody is a smoker. I am even fitter so I am a better catch!
* ex smoker talking to the dentist: I quit smoking one month after last visit (the longer the period the more truthful the answer), is it better for my oral health? (I guess the dentist did not want to make me feel bad when I was a smoker)
* ex smoker: I had a fight with my loved one yesterday,  after yelling at each other for 40 minutes we built a deeper connection and we are very happy now. If I had been a smoker I would have cut short after 30 minutes to go to smoke. 
* smoker: I was really having fun with my kids/friends but I had to take a break because I had been wanting to smoke for 20 minutes. When I came back the magic moment was finished. 
* ex smoker: the activity X lasted 2 hours, I fully enjoyed it  because I did not have the urge to smoke a cig.
* smoker: that work meeting lasted till late evening, during the last hour all I could think about was smoking a cig afterwards. If it lasted a little longer I would have killed my boss. Talking about cravings!
* smoker: another hour and a half of work and then it is finished so I can have a cig. 
* ex smoker: I smoked about a pack a day, before and after several task (work, shopping, eating, cleaning, etc) I did not care but I wasted more than half an hour each day.
* ex smoker: from time to time I have a craving, as a smoker every activity lasting more than an hour started a craving.
* smoker: I had only a few cig, why on earth I did not buy a pack, now it's the middle of the night and I really need a cig.
* smoker: I have to limit the number of cigs to find the right balance between the urge to smoke and the morning cough
* ex smoker: I still canâ€™t believe that if I am a bit tense I can take a deep breath and feel much better. When I smoked I could not take a deep breath, it made me cough.
* smoker: I am really frustrated by all these little problems that I keep postponing. Well, fuck everything, let's have a cig (and the get distracted and not solve anything)
* ex smoker: I can't believed how many cigs I did not smoke in a month, I have spared my lungs a lot of filth.
* ex smoker: so, how am I going to use the extra time and spend the money that I am saving?

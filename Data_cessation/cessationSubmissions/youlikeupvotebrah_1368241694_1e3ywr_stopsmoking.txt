A new trigger after 435 days.

Last night a girl that I've been dating for 6 months had sex with another guy while I was at her house. It hurts pretty bad right now and I haven't been through this kind of emotional trauma since I quit smoking. I thought I'd be over brutal cravings after so long without smoking but it's all I can do to not go buy a pack. Thanks for listening.

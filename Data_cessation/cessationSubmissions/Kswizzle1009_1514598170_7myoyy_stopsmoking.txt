A tip that helped me quit.

So I’ve been quit for a month and a half now and I never plan on smoking again. 

The first 2 weeks were tough. I remember reading that it’s more work to smoke a cigarette than not to. 

So in order for you to smoke you have to: leave your house
Go to the store
Buy the cigarettes 
Unwrap the pack
Find a smoking area
Light the cigarette 
Then, finally you can smoke it.

In order for you not to smoke: 
Nothing.

That has really stuck with me and I hope it can help you. ☺️

Good Luck!

quitted smoking -- sort of

I stopped smoking about a month ago. Well , not exactly . it's that i don't buy cigarettes anymore but on some occasions i still do it. Let me explain  - by my usual schedule of the week i spend 3 days in university and these 3 days are my only sober smoking days. i usually smoke about 1-2 cigarettes during these days and not pointing at my coursemates or anything but i just take up the offer. I feel the compulsion to smoke so bad when im around other people and also taking cigarettes from others is just lame. when i go out for some drinks then i just pretty much smoke 5-7 cigarettes a night. Im only 20 years old and i feel a lot better than i did before though and the thing is that i find it easier not to smoke when im not counting the days i've not smoked.  My questions are that would this be a viable option counting as "quit smoking" ? and is increase of appetite normal? and of course all tips are welcome how to take my mind off the nicotine. I'll write back if i've managed to pick up a pack from the store(that would be the failure for me).

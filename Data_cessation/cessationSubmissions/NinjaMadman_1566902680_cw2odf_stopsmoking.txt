Alcohol is my trigger. I relapsed 5 times now.

I relapsed about 5 times already. 
I wanna quit. After every relapse my lungs start hurting, i cough and i feel like shit the next day.

I noticed that, relapse is happening extremely easy when i am a little tipsy.
For example yesterday i drank 2 glasses of wine and ended up buying a pack of Marlboro.

Today i feel bad.
I dont wanna quit drinking wine, but how can i control it, from being a trigger?

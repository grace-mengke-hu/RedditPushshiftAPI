Day one - I still don't feel like I ever started

Hi, all. I want to quit and actually quit. I started as an early teen, and have tried to quit maybe dozens of times. My problem is that I feel like I am only an "occasional" smoker. That just a few cigs here and there is no big deal. That is the trap.

I've never been a pack-a-day smoker. It has always been an on-again off-again situation, so it is hard to feel any sort of urgency of like I really need to change my lifestyle.

I am committed right now. I have a real problem.

Can anyone offer me a link to other posts / resources that might help me deal with my particular struggle? I am happy to be joining this awesome community. Thanks for being here.

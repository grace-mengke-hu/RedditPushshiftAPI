I need help for a friend

I'm 16 and I have a good friend of mine that smokes from the age of 10, she has had a rough childhood and the smoking is part of her life by now, I confronted her about the topic several times but to no avail. Please, if you have any advice for me I'd be thankful because I hate seeing the people I love succumb into these kind of addictions.

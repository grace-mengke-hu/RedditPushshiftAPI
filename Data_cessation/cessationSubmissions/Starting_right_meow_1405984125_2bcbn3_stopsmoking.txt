Passed the two week mark, I am already becoming self righteous...

I was walking in the park earlier this week and I couldn't help but notice how many littered cigarette butts there were.  I have tossed more than my share from the window of my car, but most of the time I try to make sure they find their way to a proper receptacle.  I have decided to spend some free time during the next week picking some of them up and talking to the park service about installing some more butt cans along the walking paths.  I hope that picking them up helps to remind me how gross this shit is and helps to keep the addiction at bay, as well as making the area a little more beautiful.  I picked up 40 or so just in the spot I was sitting just within an arms reach, so I think I have my work cut out for me.  I'm just happy my cough is gone and I'm starting to feel better.  I will never judge someone for smoking, but if you do go back please toss the butts in a can.  It's too easy.

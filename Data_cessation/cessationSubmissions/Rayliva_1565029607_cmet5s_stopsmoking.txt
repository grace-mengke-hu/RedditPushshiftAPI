I want to quit but don't know how.

It goes without saying, I know how to quit.  You just stop.  That's what I told myself when I smoked my first cigarette.  It can't be that hard to quit, you just have to NOT do something.  Well, that was 7 years ago, &amp; although I've switched to vaping, I still feel like I am a slave.  That is why I am reaching out on reddit.  I feel like I've reached a dead end in trying to quit &amp; I'd like to hear some other's stories and advice on how they did it. 

Note: I would have posted on r/stopvaping but I think this subreddit will have more of what I'm looking for as far as responses go.  Mod please remove if not allowed. 

**Here's a little background:**

I have had depression and anxiety since I was 12.  I'm 21 now.  I was just recently diagnosed with bipolar as well.  Mental health issues, as well as traumas in my life, have really hindered every aspect of it.  When I found smoking/vaping, i basically developed a deep friendship with it.  It was always there for me and it washed away every bad feeling of the day.  Fast forward 7 years, I feel like I'm best friends with a monster.  My anxiety is much worse than it has been in the past, I have NO confidence, and I isolate so I can vape. 

 I was recently offered a job singing and playing piano at a hotel.  I don't have the ability to sing as long anymore due to not being able to breathe as well.  I don't have the confidence I used to.  So, I turned down what could've been the start of my dream job.  

I just recently moved back in with my parents after a break up with a guy I was living with 2 hours away.

**Past quits:**

I have tried to quit numerous times before.  I've tried cold turkey, patches, gum, you name it.  For me, I need the feeling in the back of my throat, which NRT just doesn't give to me.  My longest quit was 3 days , cold turkey, after reading "Alan Carr's Easy Way To Quit".  On the third day I went to visit my parents, got stressed out, got worried about taking the 2 hour trip home being so stressed (I'm a terrible driver to begin with.  Thanks, anxiety.) so I stopped and bought a little gas station vape.  I have thrown out 4 vapes, just to buy a new one a day or two later.  I have tried waiting until later in the day to have my first hit of nicotine, but "cutting down" doesn't seem to work for me.  I end up making up for it later.

I don't think I get physical withdrawals when I quit.  I spent 72 hours in a psychiatric hospital after my doctor changed my medication &amp; I declined nicotine gum &amp; was TOTALLY FINE... Until I stepped foot out of the hospital.  

I guess what I'm trying to get at with this post is, how the hell do you do it?  I don't mean to use my mental health diagnoses as excuses, and I don't think I am.  However, I go through a decent amount of mental pain and exhaustion daily, how do I take away nicotine and still be okay?  Does anyone else here struggle with depression and anxiety but made it through quitting?  How many days until you start feeling okay?  Does anyone else get very lightheaded when they quit, specifically on days 2 &amp; 3?  I'm hoping if I can be more informed about what is normal side-effect wise &amp; timeline-wise, I may have more success this time. 

I really want to quit because I think a fair amount of my anxiety could be coming from the nicotine.  I want to know what my brain functions like without it.  I could be a totally different person without the nicotine.  I'll be damned if I go my whole life never knowing her.

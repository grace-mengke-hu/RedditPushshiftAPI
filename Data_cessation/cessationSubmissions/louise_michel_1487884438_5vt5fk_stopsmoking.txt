still enjoy rolling

i feel pretty comfortable mostly as a nonsmoker now, and the occasional pang of nostalgia is there, but i try to acknowledge it, feel it for a bit, then let go (or i look at the app that told me i've already saved over $500 since 1 Jan). 

i was proud of myself for being out with friends the other night who were smoking. one of them recently bought a pouch and can't quite roll yet, so she asked me to, and i just rolled one for her and gave it back, and didn't feel like i wanted one. o sure the smell of tobacco was kind of nice, but it didn't make me wish for a cigarette. 

it felt like a good step and even though i might crave cigarettes in the future i know that i've had this feeling of not-giving-in and it feels so much better. 
 
what were your moments of small achievements, where you felt 'i got this'?

I keep having dreams of smoking

Hi, I just found this sub. I'm 9w6d pregnant and I haven't smoked a cigarette since maybe week 1. I had quit 2 months before I got pregnant but had one every 2 or 3 weeks and I think one might have been while I was technically pregnant. Anyway, as soon as I found out at 3w3d I immediately stopped considering an occasional cig and also quit vaping (i was at a very low nic content). I'm not worried about any damage, most women don't even realize as early as I did. 

Anyway, I've been doing good, haven't had even the smallest amount of tobacco or nicotine, but I've still been having cravings for them. I refuse to give into the temptation, I wouldn't be able to live with myself, but I want a cigarette so bad. I've been dreaming almost every night of it for the last few weeks. Someone help me to tell this demon to step off? Thanks

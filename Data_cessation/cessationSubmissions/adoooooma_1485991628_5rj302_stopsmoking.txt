One month nicotine free video blog

I decided for a little extra motivation to blog quitting smoking as i done it day by day and can proudly say I'm now a non smoker! 

After 12 years I'm finally free and feel great :D

If your trying to quit I highly recommend you make a video like mine (but more organised mines a bit shi*) 

Here's the link

Quit smoking May 5, 2018; Had open heart surgery August 12, 2019.

They say it was mostly bad genetics. But 21 years of smoking cigarettes forced it up on my schedule. Left main artery was 90-95% blocked (discovered just because I didn’t feel well and pushed it with my doctor, who referred me to a cardiologist). Upon testing at cardiologist, they discovered the blockage and immediately sent me via ambulance to the hospital for double bypass surgery.

When you think smoking disease, you think lung cancer.  But don’t forget heart disease - the number one cause of death in the US.

I’m 41 years old with good cholesterol, not overweight, excellent blood pressure and a normal resting EKG. They feel like based on family history this would have happened eventually, but because I smoked for half my life, it happened now. Thank god they caught it before anything REALLY BAD happened. You’ll need to check my sources here, but i believe the stats are something like: “More than half of people with heart disease don’t know they have heart disease until they have a heart attack, and about half of them don’t make it.” 

I’m still here to tell the story and to watch my daughter grow up. And I realize a lot of that is luck, so I’m paying it forward.

My advice to you is this: stay quit. Do not start smoking again, no matter how much you romanticize it in your head. Yeah, it’s pretty awesome, except when it isn’t. And in zero cases is it WORTH DYING FOR. Get checked out by your doctors. Run some prevent defense and get your heart looked at before you have to.

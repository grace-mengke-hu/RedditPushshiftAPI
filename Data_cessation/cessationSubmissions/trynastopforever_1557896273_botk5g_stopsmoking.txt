Quit On Saturday

Was a pack a day smoker. I turn 30 in a couple weeks and started smoking when I was 14. I just moved 2,700 miles across the country for work to a city where I know no one. My girl left me when I moved. Started smoking more for a couple months. I quit a few days ago because I’m sick and tired of smoking being my crutch and I don’t want to start off the next decade smoking. Not even sure why I’m writing this...first ever reddit post...but I guess I am looking for some advice or encouragement. How did y’all do it? Should I get a patch or something? I had to leave work early today because I was so antsy and frustrated but I can’t keep doing that. Thanks so much for anyone who can help.

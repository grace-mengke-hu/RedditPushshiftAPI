Falling off...help!

My issue is, I'm on medication for anxiety/concentration/depression, the medication was a Godsend, but after quitting, these issues, particularly the inability to concentrate are back to pre-medication levels.

I'm not able to see my Doc until next Friday and want to get off the smokes again before then.

My question, does anyone have any tricks/hints/suggestions to help with my lack of concentration being caused by withdrawals?

My Uncle is currently going through radiation and chemo for cancer caused by smoking, one of my major influences to quit, and frankly, I'm disgusted with myself for smoking again. 

Any advice?

Thanks in advance. 

To all the other new quitters, stay strong; you don't want to feel disgusted and ashamed of yourself and like a failure like I do right now.

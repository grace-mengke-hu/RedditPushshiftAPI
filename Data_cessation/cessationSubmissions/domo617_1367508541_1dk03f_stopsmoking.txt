Finally!

Finally, I’ve quit smoking for myself and not anyone else like I’ve done before.  I’ve hit the few month mark before so only being a day and a half is small bananas.  But I’m excited this time.  I’m excited to start feeling normal again and not bound to some evil vice.  I’m already such an active person and most are taken back to find out that I do smoke so I’m thinking soon enough I’m going to be getting after it even harder.  I’ve grown weary of being the only smoker or that person smoking a cigg after a long hike, or on the lift.  But I’m going to miss her, that sweet smoke accompanied with a beer after an amazing bike ride.  Or enjoying a coffee and a smoke on a cool morning in the desert.  She’s been a close companion of mine that wants to kill me, it’s hard to grasp but it’s the truth.  Everyone speaks of avoiding triggers, but I can’t avoid most triggers, this is my life and she’s been a part of it for some time now.  

Thanks for having a place for me to vent and express my feelings.  I’ve been smoking for 17 years, and I want the next 17 to be smoke free.  I hope to share my success story soon, but until then I’ll be pulling hair and being grumpy towards people.

Positive points

Since quitting; 

•breathing is easier, deeper

•never felt dizzy or nauseous or lightheaded that could sometimes accompany shmokes 

•I smell great. My fingers don't smell. My long hair doesn't smell. My clothes smell clean. Even my sweat smells better

•I have saved $150

•according to smokefree app I have regained 123 hours of lifetime. 

•I have started running a beginner 5k program and am impressed at my beginner improvements already and that I finally incorporated exercise in a weekly scheduled habitual way for the first time since  high school 

•quitting truly is life changing and I hope I don't backtrack 



Upcoming triggers: I start a new school year tomorrow, school and smoking go hand in hand for me, was such a constant "compliment" to the whole day - before school smokes, 3 hour class break smokes, after class smokes, after test smokes, study break smokes, writing break smokes, gathering thoughts smokes, basically my source of reinforcement for any scholarly accomplishment. It's going to be weird not smoking at school, but my program was transferred to a new campus mostly designated for health centred programs and the website mentions something about trying to be smokefree, which would be amazing bc previous  campus was literally surrounded by 100s of smokers at any given time. 

Also a 2 day outdoor music festival next weekend, don't think it will be too hard as I'm volunteering and just super excited for the bands.

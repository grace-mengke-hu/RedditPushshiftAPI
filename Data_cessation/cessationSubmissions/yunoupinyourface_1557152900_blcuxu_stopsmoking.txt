Family can be such a huge influence.

    I've been smoking since 15. I'm 21 in two months. I grew up with my entire adult family smoking cigarettes. I always told myself I never would, but being raised where you don't learn healthy coping skills sucks. I've been in a rollercoaster of emotions for so long and cigarettes have not helped me.
    Tomorrow is not just my quitting day, it's the start of my recovery. Time to learn new coping skills with a professional! This bitch is going to therapy! 
    I can't wait to take control of my life. I can get through my hardships without the help of nicotine. Wish me good luck.

3 glasses of really good sauv blanc ...

And I'm craving like a mother !!!! I had 2 small glasses yesterday before I went to lay by the pool, and fell asleep in the sun. Thank god because I may have not been able to resist the lure of a relaxed Sunday afternoon in the heat with wine woozy. After I woke up to a puppy licking my toe, someone started smoking a cig and it grossed me out. 

Today though ... Man I am finishing up that bottle of sauv blanc. I love to savor a good wine alone and smoke a few cigs. My bf and I are moving in together at mid May so this ritual will soon be forever lost.

And I just so happen to have one tiny huge cigarette glaring at me from inside a wooden drawer in the corner. My ha I can do it cig, my I didn't have to Finish the pack cig. 

Oh my god I want it.
 Someone tell me no, I need to be accountable! 

I want to tear it into pieces but can't stand the thought of doing it.

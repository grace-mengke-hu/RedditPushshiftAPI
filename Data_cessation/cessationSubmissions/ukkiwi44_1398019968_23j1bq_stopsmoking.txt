Hanging around people who are smoking to deal with craving?

Hey, I'm 20 and I quit a little less than a week ago from my 2 packs a day addiction.  I find that the best solution to craving is to hang out with friends who are still smoking because I absolutely love 2nd hand smoke and I can smell it without needing one myself. Besides, I don't have any friends who don't smoke. I know this is counterproductive but at least I'm not getting it first hand anymore. What do you guys think?

30 days smoke free and I really feel like this is it! I was a closet smoker for the last four years(smoker of 15ish years) pretending that I had already quit. It is so nice to be free of that lie and have actually quit. Slowly starting to get my breath back and can go hiking with my SO and not be embarrassed!

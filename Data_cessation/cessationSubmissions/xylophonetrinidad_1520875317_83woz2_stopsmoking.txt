Made it through the weekend!

Sunday was hard.  I had more cravings in number and intensity since I quit.  It was my first weekend at home  as a non smoker.  Sunday we had gorgeous weather and I worked in the yard—-normally I would end with a craft beer, but I’ve heard others say alcohol sometimes trips them up, so I didn’t want to chance that.  I ate and ate and ate, but I don’t care because I didn’t smoke!

Day 2 of no smoke, no e cig, just the patch.

I'm only on day 2, and Ifeel like a completely different person. Like, I don't feel like my usual self. I have had mood swings, my sensitivity to everything has increased, my appetite is all messed up, sleeping is a bitch... is this all normal for withdrawls? I used to smoke half a pack, changed to e cig, went through one cartridge a day at 24mg nicotine for a year. I purposely got the 14mg nicotine patches because Iwanted to ween off quicker. Please, Ijust need support, for someone to tell me that it will be okay... I have been chewing gum like crazy, sucking on jolly ranchers, and chewing on toothpicks. Any other advice?

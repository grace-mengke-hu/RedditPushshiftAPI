0mg ecig & drinking alcohol..

I've quit cigarettes cold turkey, about 4 days ago & I'm pretty much over the worst of it.. Feeling very positive about it now except for one thing, alcohol. I know alcohols a pretty big issue for people who have quit & it's wise to generally stay away from it.. But, I'm just wondering if anyone has quit cold turkey & used 0mg inhalers for when their out, after quitting, and if so, has it worked for them?

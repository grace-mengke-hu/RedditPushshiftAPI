Never thought I'd be disgusted by the smell of smoke

Just had a bath, got cosy afterward in a big sweater and had to change into something else because the sweater reeked of passive smoke. I'm sat here and my mind is blown that a) smoke is so disgusting to leave a smell on my clothes when I'm not even the one smoking and b) I never thought I'd be repulsed by something I used to do 20-30 times a day. Great feeling! Keep going.

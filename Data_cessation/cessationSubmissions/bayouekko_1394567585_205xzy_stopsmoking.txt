Nervous posting here.

I have been wanting to quit for a while now. Not only for the health benefits, but to save money. I smoked my last cigarette this morning. My anxiety has been more noticeable so far today. It felt weird driving at lunch without lighting up. I think it is a mind trick, but I feel that I can already breathe easier. I want to get back to being fit, and need my full lung capacity to do so. As someone who has lost a lot of weight, but recently gone from a very active job back to a desk job, I am nervous that quitting will make me gain weight. 

  I am having trouble, because I *enjoy* smoking, in certain aspects. It gives me something to do. I like inhaling the smoke. I like the social "click" you get with others as you go out for a smoke break at work. I no longer like the taste, I can't stand the smell. I just do it because it is something I have been doing for eight years. I started smoking at the ripe old age of 12. I am stuck in a love-hate relationship with cigarettes. I know the fact my husband isn't ready to quit is also going to make my journey much harder. I need some serious encouragement, tips, tricks, pointers, anything. Because right now, I really want to buy a pack on the way home from work for the comfort of just having them near...as a "once in a while" thing.

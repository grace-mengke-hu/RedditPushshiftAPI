I finally haven't smoked for a month!

I got into vaping and it really helped me. Should really try it if everything else fails. My end game is to quit inhaling smoke or vapor altogether. But for now it seems that vaping might be a better alternative. I won't say it's healthier but I will say it's definitely less harmful than cigs :)

This Thursday, I'm going to a hypnotherapist. Anyone interested in a play-by-play?

I've been smoking for most of 11 years. And not lightly. 

Part of the reason I'm seeing the therapist is because my story is a little complicated and/or entangled with other parts of my life, so it's difficult to isolate the behavior and look at rationally enough to just quit. If you guys want to hear about it, I can fill you in later. Without interest, I'd rather not spend the time hashing it out.

I tried reading Carr's book, but it didn't *quite* break through to me, for reasons I'll explain, again, if there's any interest. 

Another reason I'm doing this: I also knew someone who suffered from panic attacks, went to this particular therapist, and was cured. This prevented me from being as skeptical as I imagine I would've otherwise been.

There's a few other threads about hypnotherapy - I didn't see any gradual reports, so I thought I'd offer. There also doesn't seem to have been one in awhile.

Basically, it's gonna go like this:
On Thursday afternoon I'll go to my consultation appointment. Doc and I are gonna "discuss [my] history of smoking." If he thinks the shoe fits, we'll make another appointment and start the actual hypnosis; I'll be given recordings of the sessions for my personal use - and maybe yours! He and I will schedule the next sessions "as closely as possible." I'm not really sure what that means - every 2 business days? Once a week? I'll probably know on Thursday.

The total number of sessions (including the consultation) is capped at five, another reason I figured to go for it. At least it's not a possible black hole. He seems to think that if he can't help someone after five appointments, then it's just not going to work.

You guys want a guinea pig? It might be *educational*. (cue The Pixies.)

In any case: wish me luck? Anyone else gone through this and have any advice?

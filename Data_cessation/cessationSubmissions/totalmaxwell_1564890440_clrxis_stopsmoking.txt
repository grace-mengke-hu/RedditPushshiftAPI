Going to college in a few weeks but decided to try to quit juuling again today.

I’m just wondering if anyone has tips on how to do this in college. Iv been juuling for a year and I have tried many times to quit, but it hasn’t been till now that I realized how much money I’m wasting on this stupid addiction.

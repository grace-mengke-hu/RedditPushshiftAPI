Nicotine gums are useless and disgusting.

They taste awful and make my throat fell sore and weird. They make my heart beat harder as if I smoked 20 cigs in a row. I'm ingesting the same amount of poison as a cigarette, yet I still want to smoke. Gave them several opportunities by now, leaving them for good today.

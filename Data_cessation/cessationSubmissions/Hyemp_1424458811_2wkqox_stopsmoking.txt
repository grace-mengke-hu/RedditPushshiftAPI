Here we go....again

I've done it before, up to a year even, and then I got comfortable. During that year I was working out, ran a marathon, ran a spartan race, and now, I can barely jog across the street without getting winded..fuck that. So, this time, I am going to stop, and I will not get comfortable...good luck to the rest of you out there, I smoked my last cig earlier this morning, I have cravings like a motherfucker right now, but they will pass.

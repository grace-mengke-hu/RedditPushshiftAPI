Tonight was the night...

Like many before me I have come here to announce to the world that I have had my last cigarette ever. I have tried this before but this time I prepared and am ready to reach out. I may not be able to do this alone but I can do it. I will remember why I don't want to smoke. 

[This](http://imgur.com/pkQ0dE1) is me during my first minute as a nonsmoker. This time I will be successful. I needed to share this moment with the world. I need to remember how happy I was to finally end this ugly fight against myself.

Wish me luck...

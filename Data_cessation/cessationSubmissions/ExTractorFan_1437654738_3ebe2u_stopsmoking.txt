Just posting to see that flair

Never ever thought I'd break one year. 

It hasn't been easy - for a few months the physiological effects were really difficult - dozens of mouth ulcers, recurrence of childhood allergies, mysterious fungal infections all over my skin - but I'm out the other side. 

I will never, ever smoke again and that's the best feeling in the world.

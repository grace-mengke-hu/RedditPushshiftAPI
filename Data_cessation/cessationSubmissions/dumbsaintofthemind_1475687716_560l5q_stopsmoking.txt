96 hours smoke-free!

Hi r/stopsmoking,

I'm a 24F who started smoking when I was 16, worked my way up to a pack a day, more on weekends/when drinking, and stayed there until Saturday. For the first time in my life, I'm very happily dating a non-smoker, which initially made me start cutting back without thinking about it much, since I was always going out alone for a smoke while he stayed inside, and it just wasn't convenient. I wanted to be spending time with him, not dipping out every hour for 5 minutes. He never pressured me to quit, but he's over the moon that I'm quitting now.

Other things that led to this decision (mainly writing this out to remind myself when I crave...) is that for the past several months I started experiencing a persistent cough/weeze, exercise seemed more taxing, and that scared me. I'm in pretty good shape and like to rock climb, and it made me mad that my endurance seemed so shitty. 

Lastly, after the first 36-48 hours smoke-free, I went to the grocery store and HOLY MOLY I could actually SMELL smoke on other people from just walking past them for the first time since I can remember. And it was gross. And then I realized that's what I have been smelling like for years. 

I'm on the 21mg patch. I tried quitting cold turkey twice before and couldnt make it past 2 days because of the side effects/irritability/mood swings, and I'm absolutely stunned at how well it's working for me. I only really get cravings at night after dinner or a couple of drinks, but it's totally manageable. I want to smoke out of habit, but it's not a physiological thing screaming and begging for nicotine. So if anyone has been on the fence about patches, they're working super well for me.

I'm really happy that I'm on this journey and looking forward to being able to identify as a non-smoker for the rest of my life. Nice to meet y'all!

WHY? HELP ME.Why DON'T I want to quit?!

i finally got the nerve up to visit this sub. everyone here wanting to quit..and i am crying right now.  WHY DON'T I WANT TO QUIT? i don't understand myself-i have 2 grandkids i adore, i nursed my mom until she died of metastasized lung cancer.  what kind of fucking freakshow of a person does not want to quit?  help me, i need advice to get there.  i do suffer from depression but am on meds, btw. i hate myself for acting like this. comments welcome

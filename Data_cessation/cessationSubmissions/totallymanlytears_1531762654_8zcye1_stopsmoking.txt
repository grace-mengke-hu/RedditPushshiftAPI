Just relapsed, let me tell you how it went.

I made it to day 4, but I made the decision to relapse because my quit-zits were out of control. I knew that nicotine would help them, and I was right. 

But. 

What I didn't expect was the dizziness. Not good dizziness either, I mean the kind that makes you unable to walk straight, and the kind that makes your whole body shake. 

I didn't expect vomiting right after either. I vomited the most I ever have, and I was dead sober. 

I didn't expect feeling worse than I did before. I have a headache now, and I can assure you I am fully hydrated. 

I didn't expect how bad it would taste. IT TASTES LIKE POISON, I SWEAR TO GOD. Thats why my body forced me to throw it up. 

I didn't expect my anxiety to return either. I didn't expect the complatency I feel now. 

I did it because of my pimples, and I sure hope it helps. Because I am never going to do this for "relaxation" again. 

You are NOT MISSING ANYTHING, TAKE MY WORD FOR IT.

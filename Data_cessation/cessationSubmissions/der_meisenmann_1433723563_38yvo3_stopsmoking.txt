5 days. List of good things.

Hi everyone.

I am a non smoker for 5 days now.
I just want to list the positive changes I noticed in this first 5 days.
Right now I am aware of these changes but I might take them for granted in a few weeks. 
So for my future me---thinking about smoking "just this one cigarette"---this is why you don't:

* I am happy right now, happy in a way I have not been for a while
* I was not tired today
* I was not tired yesterday
* I was not tired the day before yesterday
* I was jogging four times this week (two times today) and it wasn't a struggle. It was fun and I wanted more.
* getting up in the morning was not the worst horror known to mankind. It was not bad at all.
* today I had Döner, strawberry cake and lasagne... they tasted amazing
* yesterday it was 30°C inside. I was able to move. I was not in physical pain because of the heat. I did not lose 4 litres
by sweating.
* Not sure if this one is positive: I can smell. Everything decided to be smelly. My toothbrush never had a smell. Today it did :(
* I feel like I have accomplished something big
* I am proud of myself
* the weird feeling in my throat is gone
* I like myself as a non smoker. More than I like to smoke.
* I don't stink

What is on your list?

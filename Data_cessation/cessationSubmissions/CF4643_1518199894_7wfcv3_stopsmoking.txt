23 Year Smoker - I Finally Quit!!

While itâ€™s only been three weeks smoke free, itâ€™s the longest Iâ€™ve ever gone after a pack a day habit. I know Iâ€™ll continue to be tested, but Iâ€™m ready. Enough is enough. Iâ€™m starting to feel better physically and more importantly for me, mentally. I donâ€™t have the guilt anymore after each time I would lite up. Instead, Iâ€™m feeling proud and accomplished.  

Any pointers from anyone to deal with social situations where smoking was a big part of it? Like outings to bars with friends, etc. For now, Iâ€™ve been avoiding those things all together, but I donâ€™t want to become a hermit. ðŸ˜† Any advice is greatly appreciated!!

Cheers!

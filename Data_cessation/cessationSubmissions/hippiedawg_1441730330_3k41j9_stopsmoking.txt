My (teen) kid is being a shit and I want to smoke.

She's breaking every rule we have and we don't have many, e.g. go to school, follow laws. Things are getting bad for her and we're worried. I'm sure she's started cigarettes, not to mention drugs/alcohol. I'm thinking of buying her a pack and have her chain smoking till she pukes. And I want a smoke to relieve me for the time it takes to smoke. But I won't. But i want to. 

Edit: I posted in r/stopsmoking, not r/parentingadvice - stop with that shit

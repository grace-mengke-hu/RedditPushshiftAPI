Oh hey! 31 days!

Has it really been a month? It doesn't feel like it. I've been so busy with work (busy season! deadlines! chaos!), graduate school applications, and my various hobbies (been designing some cosmetic mods for my motorcycle) that I almost didn't notice.

I'm most proud of the fact that I have been out drinking with friends and have been to parties and yet have not bummed any cigs from anyone. The temptation is sometimes ENORMOUS, but I just tell myself that I'm not a smoker. I don't smoke, and I don't want one. 

A few of my friends quit around new year's, and I'm the only one who hasn't fallen back into bumming all the time. They all have excuses! "Oh, I work at a restaurant". "Oh, I just want a couple puffs". "Oh, I'll just have one". "Oh, I don't smoke unless I'm drinking."

I've already saved about $100 bucks. I've recouped most of that savings by buying really nice food and yummy snacks (butter toffee peanuts, omg) but some is going into savings for: a bicycle, stuff for the Honda, a trip to NOLA later in the spring, a plane ticket to my brother's graduation, a vape for herb 'cause my poor recovering lungs can't toke it like I used to.

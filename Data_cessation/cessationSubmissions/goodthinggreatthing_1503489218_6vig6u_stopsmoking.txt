Halfway through day 3 and struggling

So I've just quit after a long time of smoking 15 a day. I tried to cold turkey but I couldn't manage so I'm on  nicotine gum and have a vape which I strictly only use between 9-10pm when I come home from work. 

I found the first 2 days really easy (gum was managing the cravings) but weirdly sitting outside for lunch today I just got this overwhelming desire for the taste and feel of a REAL cigarette. Has anyone ahead this? How to get over it and not succumb to "just the one?"

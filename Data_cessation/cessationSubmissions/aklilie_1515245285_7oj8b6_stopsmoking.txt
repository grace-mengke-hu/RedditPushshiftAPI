Made it to 5 days....

I made it to 5 days then bought a pack. Now I feel guilty and depressed. I should just quit again, try again, right? I tell my SO, who has been fighting to get me to quit for over a year now, that I need him to just back off a bit and be, I don't know, supportive? Each time I try to quit he seems to take the opportunity to be straight up abusive though. Gets angry enough to call me, for example, a Cunt. I know I need to quit for myself and not someone else, but there is this childish side of me that just decides "Fuck It". It hurts all around. I dont know what to do. I do know that I will always find an excuse to smoke again if I look for one. I also know I need help kicking a habit that has been an emotional crutch for me for 90% of my life. Where do I even turn? Reddit?

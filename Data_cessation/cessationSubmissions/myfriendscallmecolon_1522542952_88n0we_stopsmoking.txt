Today's my First Day of Cold Turkey

I've been smoking a lot for the past several years. I used to vape, but I'm trying to bump my addiction to nicotine completely (I hate being dependent on a substance). I've never really **tried** to quit before, and I've been told the first three days are the hardest. Any advice you guys (and girls) have for staying off?

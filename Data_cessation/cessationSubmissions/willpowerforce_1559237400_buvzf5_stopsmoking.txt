Knowing what you need to work on with practice

I've been doing alot of practicing.  My original quit date was 5-24 but I've cheated a few times &amp; last night I smoked 4 this morning I woke up feeling horrible!  I reset my smokefree app to today, but I now know what I struggle with the most. The evening hours &amp; with people who I enjoy smoking with the most! Any suggestions?

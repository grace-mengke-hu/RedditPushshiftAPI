60 days a nonsmoker after 46 years of smoking!

and if I can do it, you can too. I feel great, I can breathe, my kids are proud of me, and most of all, I have achieved something that I never thought that I could do: stop smoking. Imagine. I'd never been without a cigarette since I was 14. All of my adulthood. And I am free. Reddit stopsmoking, you have been my best friends and helped me through those tough early days. I can't thank you enough.

I want to stop. Are there wrong reasons to stop smoking?

I'm 24 and I've been smoking for almost three years. I smoke a pack a week. I never seriously thought about quitting. I don't know why I started but I know that I hate smoking. I hate the taste, I hate how it burns my throat, I hate how I smell and I am terrified of cancer and other health complications.

None of these are the reasons why I want to quit though. I want to quit because I met someone. He doesn't smoke and he says he is okay with it but I feel guilty. I don't want to smell horrible to him, I don't want him to see me coughing, I just don't want him to associate me with smoking. For the first time in my life, I want to quit.

Is this a superficial reason to quit? I fear that if my reasons aren't valid enough, even if I stop, I may start smoking again. I don't want to relapse. Do I need to be doing this "for me"?

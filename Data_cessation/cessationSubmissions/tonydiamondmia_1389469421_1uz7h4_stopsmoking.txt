Day 1 (again) : In the dragons mouth

I failed miserably yesterday and today I seem to be doing significantly better. I'm actually where I mostly smoke my cigarettes. Im having cravings but nothing to major, someone just lit one up in front of me and I didn't run and grab a cig. So you may not give a fuck but I'm pretty proud of myself.

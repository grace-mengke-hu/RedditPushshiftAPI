day 4 kind of?

My 24th birthday was the 5th.  I "quit" on the 6th. I've been offered an accumulative $1000 from family members if I quit and stay quit for a year.

I never smoked more than a half a pack a day and since the 6th have had less than one ciggarette a day but I can't find myself to just not have any.  I had a half of a cigarette yesterday, a few puffs this morning and will probably have a few puffs tonight. 

Advice on this tappering off method?   Is it bullshit?  Is it working?   Ahhg.

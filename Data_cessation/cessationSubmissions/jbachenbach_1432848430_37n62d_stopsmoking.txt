2 months now without a puff but lately I'm wondering "why am I doing this to myself?"

I feel like I'm missing out on a simple pleasure that I shouldn't have to deny myself and the pros to smoking (I should know better...I've read Alan Carr) seem to outweigh what I feel I've gained by quitting.  I ascribe to some basic Buddhist teachings with which I've been trying to rationalize having another cigarette after 50 days without a puff.

More specifically, both craving and aversion are our sources of suffering (I suppose they're really just two sides of the same coin).  So back when I was smoking, my opinion was that by quitting I could rid myself of a major source of dependence/attachment/craving (i.e. suffering).  I never felt that way upon quitting, though.  I experienced no sense of achievement or freedom from the slave master.  The only benefits that I notice and appreciate are the enhanced sense of smell and reduction in mucus.  So now...when I want a cigarette so bad, my struggle to avert is more miserable than the craving sensations that I left behind.  I think to myself why not just have a rollie with a coffee in the afternoon on a park bench.

Hm...as I wrote that last sentence, it really kind of bothered me.  Felt like a bit of self betrayal...

Someone talk some sense into me :)

Day 50: totally worth it

Hello, I'm a longtime lurker and just wanted to offer my insights on quitting.  I switched to vaping on Valentine's Day and haven't looked back.  (Tried cold turkey several times didn't work for me). I thought I'd list the benefits I've experienced for those who are just starting:

1:  I can run much further and faster.
I felt like hit a wall with my exercises before I quit smoking and I've since smashed my previous goals.

2:  Increased libido
I didn't have E.D. but I felt like my sex drive was declining and chalked it up to getting older.  Since I've quit I feel like I'm 20 again in the libido department.  

3:  Little to no hangovers
This one is probably my favorite.  I drink twice a week nowadays but when I do I like to get drunk.  I've been pleasantly surprised to find that I barely if at all have a hangover even after heavy consumption whereas before I'd feel completely terrible the next day.

4:  my mood has improved significantly 
I still have my bad days but my outlook is much more positive since I've quit 

The one negative?  I've gained 4-5 pounds but I'm working on it.

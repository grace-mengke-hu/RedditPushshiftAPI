4 Days on the Patch.

My wife and I decided to quit smoking this past week for the financial benefits. I had been a smoker for the past 20 years. I have shook a few bad habits in my time. I've been drug free for almost 9 years and haven't had an alcoholic drink in 2 years and 8 months.  
  
I'm on Day 4 of not smoking with the help of a nicotine patch. The mental battle is still there, but it's getting easier. I'm not really posting here for support, encouragement doesn't do much for me. I was just wondering if any of you have had experience with the nicotine patch? Can I use it effectively to separate the mental addiction from the physical addiction? Or will the mental struggle resurface once I start cutting back on the patch?  
  
I'm a bit stubborn and will continue using the patch either way, I just want to know what to expect. Thanks in advance for your responses.

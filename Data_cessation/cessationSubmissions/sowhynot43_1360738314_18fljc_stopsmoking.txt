college student here tempted to go pick up an e-ciggarrette. Never been a smoker, tell me why I shouldn't? 

I've never been a smoker (aside from the occassional hookah or something but almost never). 

I've been having the urge to pick up an e-cig lately. not to smoke with friends, not to use it around others. Just something to do and keep me awake while studying and shit like that. 

I have a feeling this is a bad idea. Can someone convince me not to?

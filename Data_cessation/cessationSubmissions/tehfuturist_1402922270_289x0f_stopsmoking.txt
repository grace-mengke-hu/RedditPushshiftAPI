YSK: Smoking cigars is still feeding your nicotine habit and putting you in risk of cancer.

I had quit quite a while ago, but I've always enjoyed the social aspect of puffing away, so naturally I gravitated towards cigars. Although it killed my taste buds and made me smell like smoke, I still did it because it's fun. 

I decided to look into it today, and apparently it's pretty bad for you. [link](http://www.cancer.org/acs/groups/cid/documents/webcontent/002965-pdf.pdf) 

If you've quit like I have then the hard part is over. Just realize that there's no need to keep putting yourself at risk by smoking cigars or being a slave to nicotine. I, for one, will be steering clear of them from now on.

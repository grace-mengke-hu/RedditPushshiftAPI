Thanks

I have the least amount of control over my life right now. My world is spiraling and at this point I just have to sit and watch to see what happens next. Shit just keep happening. It gets so intense by the time evening comes that I am out of control, stressed, depressed, and I crave cigarettes. I have no idea how I've managed to still not smoke at this point but come morning time, I don't hurt so much. And, I am happy I made it yet another damn day without lighting up. I use to be strong and hopefully soon I will be able to comfort others instead of others comforting me. I read these threads and even though my problems are so much larger than smoking cigarettes, you folks do help. Thank you all.

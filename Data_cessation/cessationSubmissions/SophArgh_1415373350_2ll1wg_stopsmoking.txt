looking for some advice and encouragement please

hi there!
I'm a 24 year old lady who has been a pack-a-day smoker for about 3 years. I've half-heartedly tried to quit in the past, only lasting a day or two. 

I had a scare with my health in december of 2012; long story short I had a CT scan of my lungs and they thought they found a tiny 1-2mm mass in my lung but upon seeing a specialist (who told me it was most likely how they cut the CT scan images, not an actual mass) they did a bronchoscopy and found my lungs were clear and normal and I was all okay! PHEW. 

Stupidly, I started smoking again since I was just so addicted. Recently I started to have problems breathing and went to the hospital but the doctor checked my breathing and lungs and assured me I was fine and normal and I ended up getting the flu and horrible cough the next day so it was most likely just the combined chest infection and mucus build up. But they write it off as related to my panic attacks and anxiety. 

I got so sick of being a smoker and being constantly worried for my lungs and health - and I kept getting episodes of panic and breathlessless which I'm sure were panic attacks - so almost two weeks ago I quit smoking cold turkey. I've done really well. I haven't slipped up (until now) and have minimal cravings, it's mainly psychological and feeling bored with life without cigarettes. 

I was however so tempted to smoke tonight that I had a few puffs of one of my mothers cigarettes. It tasted disgusting and I threw it away immediately. 

But I'm so scared and convinced that I have some lung condition even though I was checked out and cleared only just under two years ago and obviously it takes a long time of smoking to develop chronic conditions. 

I was just wondering if you guys had any words of encouragement or similar experiences with your health concerns and smoking. Because sometimes it's hard for me to just write off those recent episodes of breathlessness as panic related.

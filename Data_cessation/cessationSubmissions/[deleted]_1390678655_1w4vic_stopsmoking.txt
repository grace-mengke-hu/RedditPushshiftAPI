Cold Turkey {Day 1}

This day I claim victory over my cigarette addiction. (Newport) was my brand of choice and oh so expensive they were! $5.55 is what I shell out for a box and by no means am I really able to afford such a habit. I'm not a box a day smoker like most people. Probably 3 or 4 a day. Even more when coupled with alcohol and marijuana which i'm also quitting.

I know this will be a long journey and temptation will be great (been smoking for about 6 yrs now) but I want my life back like it was before I was introduced to this addiction.

Wish me luck........

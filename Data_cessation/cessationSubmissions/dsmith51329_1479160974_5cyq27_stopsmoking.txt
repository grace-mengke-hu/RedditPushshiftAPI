Quit Date is 11/16 after 15 years of smoking

Hello everyone.

I'm reaching out to reddit, and every other avenue I have to support me in my quitting journey.

I started smoking when I was 15, and realized I was dependent on it in my early 20's, as before that I could stop and start for months with no effect.

I only smoked about 8 cigarettes a day, and would smoke much more when drinking. 

I have rituals I'm used to, specific times I took smoke breaks, coming in 10 minutes early to smoke before my shift, as I don't smoke in my car.

I'm very nervous for my quit date, and for potential side effects of Chantix, as 3 of my friends all tried it and had to quit taking the drug around week three due to nausea and depression setting in.

I'm going to post my highs and lows through this process.  I think this will help more than anything in digesting my feelings and emotions.

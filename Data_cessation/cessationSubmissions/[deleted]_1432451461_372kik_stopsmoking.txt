Back again.

So, yeah. I've quit multiple times before. Started up late last year again.

Kind of embarrassing but I promised myself I'd quit at the beginning of this year and it just kind of... dragged on.

The moment I decided to quit was last weekend when I was at the grocery store. I had my budget all worked out and I thought "Okay, I have enough cash to feed myself for this weekend - protein, fruit, veg, and even a little dessert. *Or* I could live off instant ramen and buy a pack of smokes."

Yeah, it sucked. Not only because I ate the same noodles for every meal over the weekend but also because I knew I had sacrificed a healthy option for something that doesn't benefit me whatsoever. 

I finished that pack mid week and come grocery day last Friday, I decided to kick the habit again. It's been a bit tough, constantly on my mind but I've been through this before and I know I can handle the initial craving. These carrot sticks are helping wonders nom nom nom.

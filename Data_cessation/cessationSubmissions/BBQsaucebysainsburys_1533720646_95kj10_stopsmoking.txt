Today is going to be the day... again.

Right... quick back-story, then I'd love some advice with how to best succeed.

So, I decided to quit about 6 or 7 months ago. Failed miserably. Got onto this sub and gave it another go, lasted two weeks. Got the Stop Smoking app, lasted another two weeks. Then it went like that for a while - two weeks on, two weeks off - made it three weeks at one point. Then I read the Allen Carr book and it was like a veil was lifted. I suddenly knew *why* I didn't want to smoke. Things were going well, I even was drinking around smoker friends and didn't have one. After just under four weeks I failed again. Haven't lasted two weeks since. I'm not sure why I smoked after reading the Carr book, because it made so much sense. I even copied loads of the little mantras down, to quickly explain to me in times of need why there was no need for me to do this stupid, stupid thing. Last week I didn't smoke, then at the weekend I did. Today, I am going to do it for good. I know that the best way to stop, is just to stop smoking. It's that simple. There are no good reasons to do it, and plenty to stop. I know that I was brainwashed into thinking it was doing something for me, and that it really, really wasn't. I've re-set my flair. I will come on this sub every day. 

I think the problem was always: at the moment of quitting I desperately wanted to feel better. After three days of not smoking I felt better and thought "how bad could it have been?" I forgot all the bad things about it, and just remembered that little head-rush. I always used to smoke when bored - even though that I know th*ere is nothing interesting about a cigarette* \- and now I find myself smoking when bored, despite this knowledge. 

Any advice as to what's worked for you specifically?

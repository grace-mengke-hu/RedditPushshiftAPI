Day three of non smoking, day 4 of non drinking

So this is my third day of not smoking and my 4th day of not drinking.  I've recently identified myself as an alcoholic and I figured while I'm at it,  I might as well save my lungs and my heart and my brain as well.  I also went to the gym last night and the day before and worked out like a madman. I don't know how much longer I can put up with this but I'm going to give it a go so far so good. Is there a badge system in place for this subreddit? I would love to be able to display at least to myself how long it has been since I've had a cigarette .

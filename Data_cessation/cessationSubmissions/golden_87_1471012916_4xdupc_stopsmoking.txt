Scared to hang out with friends...

I haven't hung out with my smoker friends while drinking since I quit. I made plans with them for this weekend where there is sure to be drinking involved. I've been at bars since I've quit and been around smokers but the smokers were strangers and no one in the group I was with smoked. The group of smokers I've made plans with are my close group of friends, we used to hang out at least once a week if not more frequently.

I don't want to keep avoiding them, but I'm nervous what my brain might try talking me into in the moment being the only one not smoking in a group of 6. I don't want to smoke again, I don't want to let something have control over my like cigarettes did.

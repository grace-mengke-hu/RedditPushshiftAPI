Day 200

Randomly decided to check my Quit Smoking app and today is exactly 200 days since I decided to quit. 200 days ago I decided to tackle a whole slew of bad habits, I remember waking up that morning after a night of drinking and chain smoking and I just felt so bad and knew I never wanted to feel like that again. That very day I decided no more smoking, drink a lot less, stop binge eating, start working out-- basically, take back my life from the six year depressive slump I had been in. I couldn't lie to myself anymore, I was killing myself. 

As a result of all this I've also lost 40 pounds. My quality of life is so much better now, my chest doesn't hurt all the time, I'm not out of breath walking and I can even do intense cardio, I don't have to interrupt what I'm doing every thirty minutes to take a smoke break, I smell better. When I first started I thought it would be impossible, but after that first week I never looked back. I hope anyone coming to this sub today who is thinking about quitting makes today their quit day!

At a convention; Tempted to smoke just this once

I'm at a convention (not going in detail on what kind it is) and just because it is a special time of year I want to just be able to let loose and smoke a cigarette. I'm almost at my one month mark and i'm considering to allow it, but there is a part of me that doesn't want to.

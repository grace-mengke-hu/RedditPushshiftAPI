Looking for things to do instead of smoking

The title is basically the gist of this post. So I'm lookimg for things to do to keep my mind off of wanting a smoke. ATM ive basically just been cooking food, when I get the chance and doing about 50 miniature workouts a day but my body cant keep up. I had no idea how much i would think about it while tryimg to quit and stopping the urges with a workout does not seem like such a good thing to do now. I cant even game or read most of the time because I just get so distracted by the thought of smoking and have to do something that stimulates my brain a bit more or i end up going for one
I'm hoping some of you wonderful people might be able to throw me some of your go to distractions for me to try
Any help would be much appreciated

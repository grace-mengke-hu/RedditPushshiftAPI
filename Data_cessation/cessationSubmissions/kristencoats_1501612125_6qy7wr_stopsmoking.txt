Day 15

I'm on day 15 and I'm actually having a good day. Today my reasons for quitting are standing out and I'm using the extra time to workout and do things I normally wouldn't do. I think getting to 2 weeks changed my whole attitude. It's been tough, yesterday I left my job of 2 years to start a different one and I'm so glad I made it through without smoking. It's actually more of a hassle to go out and buy a pack now and it helped me cut out other bad habits like a 5 hour energy shot everyday, which cost an extra $4 and honestly just kept me up all night!

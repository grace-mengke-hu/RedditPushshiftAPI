Feeling so agitated all the time.....

Currently on day 12. First 10 days felt almost easy. But the last 2 days have been the worst so far. What makes it harder is my boyfriend just doesn't understand. Keeps asking me what's wrong.  Please.... does anyone have any advice on how to deal with a boyfriend who is like this that has never smoked?  I need help :( 
He does try but he sometimes at no fault of his own makes it worse.

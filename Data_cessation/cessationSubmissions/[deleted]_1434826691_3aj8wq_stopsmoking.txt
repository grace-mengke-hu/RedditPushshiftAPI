For those of you who recently slipped up, here's how I quit and stay quit.

Warning: Incoming wall of text.

I'm no better. I've quit before and relapsed. The only thing I have is persistence. I'm fucking stubborn. I want to quit and I'm going to keep trying until I do. Here's my story.

And it's a familiar story: I started smoking when I was 18 but it was intermittent. I could go for weeks without a cigarette but smoke non-stop for a weekend. I thought I was the exception. 

However, what I didn't know was that it wasn't *really* smoking. I wasn't pulling the smoke into my lungs. I figured this out one day when I *did* pull the smoke into my lungs. Ohhhhh. I get it. After that, I was hooked.

But I quit at least seven times between then and now (I'm in my mid 40's). This most recent time is what I'm going to write about.

I knew I needed to quit again from the moment I picked up the first cigarette after the last time I quit. Every time I put "cigarettes" on my shopping list I would put a frowny face next to it :-(  I started thinking about all the crappy stuff I had to do to get along with smoking. 

- Driving with the windows open and the heat on (in winter) so my clothes wouldn't smell like smoke. 

- Leaving my windows open (in winter) so my apartment would smell less like smoke. 

- Keeping my bedroom door closed so at least my bedroom wouldn't smell like smoke. 

- Walking a quarter mile on my break so no one at work would see me smoking. 

- Constantly having to do laundry because I could only wear my clothes one time before they smelled like smoke. 

Seriously, the list goes on.

Then I started thinking about how much money I was spending. Ten dollars a pack, smoking an average of half a pack per day (more on my days off, less when I worked). That's $1800/yr. I *live* to travel and that's the price of a two-week, international trip - airfare included! 

What about my health? That factored into it, but it wasn't my main reason for quitting. In the mornings, I would sometimes sneeze and it felt like my lungs were about to burst out of my chest. Horrible sensation. A few coughs. More colds than normal. Other than that, though, nothing really going on.

Basically, as you can tell, it was the smell that got to me. The constant work-arounds to avoid or minimize it. 

So I thought about quitting a lot. 

I was on vacation at the beginning of the year, with my smoker boyfriend, in a place where smoking is prevalent, and I was waiting until I got back to quit. Then the boyfriend and I broke up, and I downloaded an app to help me quit and, when I got back, I researched vaporizers and ordered a GOOD one online (V2-brand "Pro" Series 3).

The DAY it arrived, I smoked my last two cigarettes, started vaping and never picked up another one again. 

[Detailia: At first, I vaped the vanilla "e-juice" I bought with the vaporizer. It was medium-level nicotine (12mg). But after a week I got tired of it and bought a new "e-juice". This was Space Jam-brand "Astro" in 6mg nicotine (I figured, 'new flavor, drop the nicotine, won't notice'). So I vaped that for a couple of weeks or so. Also, the app is called "Smoke Free (Beta)", available for iPhone and Android. It's free and gives you daily "missions" to complete.]

One day, about three weeks into vaping, I forgot to use my vaporizer all day. Well, huh. After that I found myself using it less and less. Once a day. Once every couple of days. Went a week without it. Boom, done. 

I carried it with me for another solid month, everywhere I went I carried that vaporizer with me, just in case I wanted a cigarette, so I wouldn't cave and buy a pack. Never needed it, but still. I think I got lucky. Still have the thing even though it's been a couple of months since I last took it off the charger. Just sitting there. Just in case. I like it there. It's a buffer between me and Marlboros. 

You know what? 

- My heating bill went down by half since I'm no longer keeping my windows open in winter. I can close my windows and shut out the noise!

- My gas mileage went up since I'm no longer blasting the heat with the windows open to let the smoke out. Oh hey, heat! And I can 'listen to the radio at a reasonable volume'. And I don't have to constantly carefully hide the butts in the trash (my apartment doesn't allow smoking). 

- My water usage is way down since I'm not doing as much laundry. Hello wearing jeans twice!

- I put all the money I would have spent on cigarettes into a jar. At first, I did this daily, to the penny. Now, I do it every couple of weeks. It's been 114 days and I've saved $565. CASH. I'm thinking about going to Asia with the money :-)

Sadly, I also found out I needed to give up coffee. I'll still have a cup if someone wants to 'meet for coffee' but that's once monthly, not two cups daily. Coffee and cigarettes just went together so well that I found coffee was a trigger for me. Maybe someday I can go back to coffee and have a new pattern to establish. For now, it's off the menu.

Okay, enough with the wall of text. I am not even trying to suggest this is my final time for sure. It might be, it might not be. I hope it is. 

tl;dr - Vaping, thinking about stuff I don't like about smoking, rewarding myself for good behavior, providing against weakness, getting rid of triggers.

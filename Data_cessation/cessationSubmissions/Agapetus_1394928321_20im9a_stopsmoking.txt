Smoking ruined my lips

Women used to complement me on my lips, now they're crusty and have a permanent sore right in the centre and on the left side, plus discoloration and general nastiness. Sucks man, wish I'd never started, and wish I could quit permanently - but I always cave in and have a smoke at some point.

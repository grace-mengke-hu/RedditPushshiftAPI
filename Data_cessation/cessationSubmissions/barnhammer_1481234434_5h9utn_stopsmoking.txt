I quit 54 hours ago...

Mostly because I have a terrible cold. But also for many, many other reasons. My boss' step dad gave me some nicorette gum, and I have 1/2 a piece every once in a while. I'm not exactly struggling with quitting, I just really don't know what to do with myself. I've been a smoker for 7 years. I was 14 years old when I started. Almost everything I have done as a young adult, has been done with a cigarette in my hand. 


I just want to know how you guys cope with not smoking. It feels so lame. I realize that ANY of the side effects of smoking are much lamer than not smoking, but I guess I just need a bit of encouragement. Does it really get better after a few days?

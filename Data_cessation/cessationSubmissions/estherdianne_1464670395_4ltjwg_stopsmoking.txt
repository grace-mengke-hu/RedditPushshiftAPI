The smallest things help

So I've hit my 100 day mark (yay me!) and I've been reflecting on what's helped me the most, and wondering if it could help others. Here it goes!

- Talk about it. The more people I told about my quit, the more people I had to hold me accountable. It helps that I hate the thought of letting others down. Plus, you meet tons of ex-smokers who also give you awesome tips and tricks! 

- Write down why you're quitting. Put it in a spot where you'll always see it. I kept mine where I usually kept my cigarettes. 

- Distract yourself with something else. T.V., books,LEGOS (I've built more LEGO sets than I care to admit). Something to get your attention (and hands) distracted. 

And never forget, you're not alone! This is the best choice I've ever made, and I'm so excited and happy when others decide to do the same. Good luck!

I quit on Sunday

Its now Thursday....made it through Thanksgiving.

I think I can do this. Albeit I'm cheating....still chewing tobacco but everyone believes that is still better than smoking (doctor/dentist agree).

The real challenge will be kicking nicotine completely but one thing at a time. For anyone who is losing hope....I quit for 2 years smoking...still chewed....but I didn't think I could ever put the cigarettes down. I did....then I got into a group of friends who went out for beers and I said  "ok, once in awhile I can smoke when I drink" -- that was 2 years ago. 2 fucking years straight of smoking again. Now I'm done for good. I will not make that fucking mistake again.

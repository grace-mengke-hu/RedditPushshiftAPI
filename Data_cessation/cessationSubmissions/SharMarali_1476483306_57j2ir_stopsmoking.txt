One year ago today, I smoked my last cigarette. How am I doing?

Great!  I don't miss smoking anymore.  I actually feel sorry for people when I see them lighting up, and a little grossed out.  

One year ago, I was just like a lot of smokers.  I had accepted that I was going to be a smoker for life.  I had accepted that even if I ever did manage to quit, I'd always feel like I was missing something.

I quit because I came down with a really bad cold.  As per usual, when I got a cold, I had horrible breathing problems.  I couldn't smoke for 3 days because I couldn't breathe well enough.  Once the 3 days were up, I thought, well, I've already done all of the nicotine withdrawal and slept through most of it.  I might as well not start back up again.  

My SO was supportive, but I'm quite sure he didn't believe I was really going to quit.  I tried vaping for awhile, with 0 nicotine, to help break the psychological addiction.  After a couple of months, I didn't need it anymore.  I read most of Easy Way (didn't finish it) and a lot of what it said made perfect sense to me.  It changed the way I thought about smoking and my supposed need to keep doing it.

Here I am, one year later, with zero desire to ever smoke another cigarette again!

One thing I will add though, is that I still have vivid smoking dreams.  They are *so* vivid that I sometimes have to stop and think about whether it's *really* been a year since I smoked an actual cigarette.  Those dreams make me think I've broken my streak, and I hate it!  I had one of the dreams as recently as a couple of weeks ago.  I always wake up feeling so ashamed and sad, and then I realize after a few minutes that it was a dream.

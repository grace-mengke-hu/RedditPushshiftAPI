Skin sos

Hi soz to bother you - since stopping smoking the skin on my face has become red blotchy & extremely dry (my moisturiser is only relieving it for about an hour) i have just spoken to a pharmacist & he said he's never heard of that as a side effect of stopping smoking. Has anyone else experienced this or something similar?

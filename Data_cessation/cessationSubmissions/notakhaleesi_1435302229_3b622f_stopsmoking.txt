Day 18. 2nd attempt

Ok this is my 2nd attemt trying to quit. Last time it lasted about 10 months but some events lead to starting again. I am an athlete so it really is bad for my performance and I get all judgemental looks and stuff. 
This time I bought an e-cig and I have not smoked since I bought this two weeks ago. I know this is not much but is something to begin with!

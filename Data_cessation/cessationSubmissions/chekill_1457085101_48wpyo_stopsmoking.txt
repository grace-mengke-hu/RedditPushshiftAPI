Does the depression go away ?

I've been a quite heavy smokers for 12-13 years at 20-35 cig a day and I've stopped almost 3 days ago. I'm using a patch (high dosage) and gum sometimes. 

Overall I think I'm good since I'm not craving too much for a cigarette but my problem is that I'm constantly thinking of cigarettes and the fact that I stooped... This is terribly annoying and I cannot accomplished anything at work. And more I'm now afraid to do anything else than lying in my bed because I'd go buy a pack I'm almost certain...and I get depressed. My question is does anyone also had the same issue of being so depressed and unable to focus on anything ? Will it go away ? In how much time ? Thanks for your help!

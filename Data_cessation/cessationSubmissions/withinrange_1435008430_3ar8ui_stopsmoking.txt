500 hours smoke-free

Honestly, seeing my quit in terms of hours has made it somewhat easier and more satisfying. I use the Smoke Free app and am really grateful for this metric. The win feels more continuous, more immediate. 

By no means am I out of the woods. But seeing progress and community here helps a lot. Thank you for that. !!

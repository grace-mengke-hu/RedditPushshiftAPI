Day 2 ~30 hours. Feeling very crappy and highly agitated.

-I've been a smoker for 5-6 years- I am 26 now and want to quit before my 27th birthday.

I've tried a million times to quit and this feels like the hardest time. I don't remember ever being this mentally exhausted and irritable before :( I blew up at my bf for something stupid and tried to pick apart and destroy my ~1 year long term relationship. Last time I tried to quit I got severely depressed and my emotions were out of control and it freaked me out so I started up again. 

Right now I'm feeling OK, I have some cough syrup with hydrocodone that was prescribed to me for the massive sinus infection I had (it's one of the reasons I wanted to quit smoking along with being able to take long jogs and not worry about lung cancer or heart disease) so I'm a little more calm, relaxed and my muscles don't hurt anymore.

I don't know why I'm reacting so bad to quitting and feel kind of like a failure for not being able to deal with it cold turkey. If things get too bad I'll get some nicotine gum.  Thanks for letting me unload.

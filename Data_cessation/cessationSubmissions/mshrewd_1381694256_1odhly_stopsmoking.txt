E-cig ran out of juice last night . Now I'm going crazy.

After 3 weeks of only vaping (smoked cigarettes for 10 years) my E-cig ran out of juice last night, and I refuse to buy more. I thought this damn thing would make life easier, but no. Feels like a rickety old crutch, and hasn't made not smoking any easier. Feels bad man, like quitting cold-turkey...  So I figure I might as well quit cold turkey. I give up on you E-cig! Quitting cold turkey today! Anybody else think vaping is not a great way to quit smoking?

UPDATE: 3 days down with no nicotine. It's official, vaping for me was about the same as quitting cold turkey. thanks for all the support. the fight goes on.

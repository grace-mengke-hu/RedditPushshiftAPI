Finally took the jump

Kinda just wanted to shout into the void about it lol but my girlfriend and I decided to quit together and it's only been 4 days but her and I haven't had a cigarette or any nicotine since and I feel great! It's definitely getting a lot easier and I'm so happy I finally stuck to it and decided to quit

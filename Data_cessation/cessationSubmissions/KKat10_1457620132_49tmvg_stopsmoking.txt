5 Pounds in 2-1/2 weeks :(

OK I am compensating by eating stuff - I will cop to it. I'm having crazy sugar cravings, so some reason.  I just hoped I would keep it under control, but I find myself slipping into comfort snacking to stop the fits.  I already have some weight to lose - it's very daunting to have more now. It's one of the reasons I was afraid to quit because I KNOW what I turn to when I'm stressed.  Gum isn't cutting it! Anyway, just feeling depressed and pissed at myself. :(

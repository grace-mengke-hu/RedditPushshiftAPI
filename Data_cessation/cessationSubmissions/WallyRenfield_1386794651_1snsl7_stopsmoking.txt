Nervous Hands

I've been enthusiastic about quitting smoking before, but the biggest hurdle for me to jump has always been my idle hands.  Even as a child, long before I started smoking, I was the type of person who always needed to be doing something with my hands.  Whether it was doodling in my notebook at school or shoved in my pockets playing with coins, my hands have to be in motion.  Smoking has always just given me something to do.

Any suggestions on how to keep my hands busy?  Even better, any suggestions on how to ignore my nervous habit?

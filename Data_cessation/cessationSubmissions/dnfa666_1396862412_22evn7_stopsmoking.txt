Question about difference in 'vascularity'. Does anyone else notice their veins are more prominent?

Think I've heard that your heart rate/ blood pressure should go back to normal within like 30 min- an hour after you smoked, but in the last week I've noticed my veins popping out like they used to so many years ago.  I've been losing a little weight, so I'm not sure if this is due to that or not.  Does anyone else notice this?  And does smoking just have longer lasting impacts on circulation and blood pressure than I had thought?

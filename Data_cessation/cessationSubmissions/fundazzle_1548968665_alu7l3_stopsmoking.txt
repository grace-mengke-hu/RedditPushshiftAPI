There’s one issue I see with Allen Carr’s book that keeps me coming back to cigarettes. Maybe you guys can help.

So, The Easy Way To Stop Smoking really gave me some perspective on my habit, and had gotten me to quit, numerous times - unfortunately I haven’t stuck with it.

The times I’ve quit, I think about nicotine is the problem, not that I need to “relax”, or “feel confident” when smoking. I’m just chasing my baseline, where cigarettes are the cause of my dipping below in my health and relaxation.

But the one thing I can’t shake is the simple fact that nicotine/cigarettes stimulates that *pleasure center* in my brain. Allen Carr (or maybe I missed it) didn’t seem to address this simple thing). He only addressed the obvious ones, like nicotine is a stimulant therefore it can’t relax you.

Cigarettes just make me feel *good*. After an argument with my girlfriend (for example), a cigarette stimulates my emotion enough to make me feel like everything is okay.

How can I shake this? Or how else can I (scientifically speaking) replicate that same “pleasure center” stimulation from something other than cigarettes??

Day 9... WHEW! My thoughts and progress.

*Pardon the disorganization.* 

So I decided to quit for good at the start of Movember, as a part of my giant plan of getting rid of a lot of bad habits acquired over the past several years. Here's how its gone so far:

Days one and two were with the patch but then I felt that delaying the withdrawal symptoms to a later date was kind of pointless. 

Day 3, no patch. It was a bit easier than I thought it would be. 

Day 4, cravings intensified but were manageable.  


Day 5, holy mother of god. I barely remember the events that happened that day. Everything was just a dang blur from what I would like to call the longest largest craving ever. I was also very, very angry. But I endured. 

Since then it's been a lot easier. It's now just not smoking when a trigger happens. However, I've yet to find another vice to replace smoking so I've just become a wee bit angrier than normal and more frazzled. 

Honestly, of all my times trying to quit, this time was the easiest. Being in the military and quitting there was just not happening. Now that I'm in college, psssshhhhh, this was a breeze.

 

 

 

 

 To all those out there that just recently quit, **WE GOT THIS!!**

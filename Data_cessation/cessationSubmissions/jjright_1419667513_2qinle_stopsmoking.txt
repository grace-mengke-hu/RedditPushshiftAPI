A year has come and gone and I didn't notice!

I was planning to celebrate my one year smoke free date. I was going to congratulate myself, inspire my family and friends, etc. Instead I just went about getting ready for Christmas. Because I'm not a smoker. This group was so encouraging to me. Thanks for all of the posts! 
AMAZING!

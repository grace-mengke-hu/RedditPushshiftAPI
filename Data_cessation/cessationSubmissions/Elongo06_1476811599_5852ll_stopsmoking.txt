2 years!!!

I just have to vent this out.

Wow today marks my 2nd year of not smoking! I can't believe it's gone by so fast. I smoked for 20 years at a pack a day or more.
Finally I hit that point to where I had enough. Weird it was on the 20th year though. But anyways between using the Nicoderm CQ patch for the full program, using this subreddit and Allen Carr's video it all worked and I haven't had one puff.

The patch worked well but it did leave temporary red squares on you and it itched a bit. The side effects were lucid dreams. If that happens and it gets to be too much, you can do a 16 hour day with the patch instead of 24 hours.

Every now and then I will get a slight craving still but it's gone in a minute or so. It depends on what I am doing as certain things can spark like a quick nostalgia. But like I said it fades quickly.

My toughest time was a visit to France last year. I went out on a night on the town in Lyon with dinner and drinks. The company I was with were smoking and for some dumb reason it kinda smelled good(which is odd) But I stuck to my guns and didn't smoke. 

Here I am another year later and still doing well. 

I wish all of you just starting out good luck. You're on the right path to happiness. No more will you smell like hell. No more will you rush through meals so you can go outside to smoke. No more will you freeze your ass off this winter smoking outside. No more a slave to the nicotine monster. You will gain a lot of free time by not smoking. A new hobby will fill the void and keep your mind off of smoking.

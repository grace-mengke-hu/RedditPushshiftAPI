Whats the 1st smoke after quitting like?

If anyone has started smoking again months after quitting... What's it like.. is it amazing? Is it everything you thought it would be? Or is it shit? I'm a month in and still always tempted to smoke just 1 last one. I never had a "last one" and it's STILL bothering me. Just wondering if I tried to have a last one now would it even be good

Heads up to American Spirit Smokers

july 2014 i quit cigs up until feb 2017. i went from 20 a day to zero. i maybe had 1 cig every 2-3 months(if that).. When i restarted i smoked maybe 5-7 a day..my throat was on fire at night, had post nasal drip the following days..it was terrible...eventually as time rolled on into jan 2018 i started getting weird side effects of cigs...i would be standing and all of sudden i'd feel dizziness...then i tried to vape and eventually got palpitations before sleep...shit was wild...then eventually i got highway driving anxiety which is something i've never gotten before(i've drove 155 mph on the high way) and now i was going 60 mph(5 mph under the speed limit) on the slowest lane....i knew something was wrong but i didnt wanna admit it...i didnt wanna quit cigs...so i switched to american spirits in like march 2018 up until a week ago...right before i quit i was getting derealization and massive anxiety...so i quit...and i swear...i've never had such bad withdrawals before...these cigs are the worst and i highly recommend no one smoke American spirits..first few days...i am not a suicidal person...but the derealization was driving me nuts and before i would sleep i would say it would be a lot better to not exist right now...never had any intention on acting on these thoughts..but yeah...these fucking cigs...i've never had so much anxiety caused by any cig before...i hope you all can be safe and always remember these cigs are a mind game...protect your inner peace and your mental happiness...

House fires and cigarettes

Maybe about 3 or 4 months ago I started smoking again after 37 successful days of being quit. I was stressed out because the fire department had just left my house. It wasn't a super bad fire, it was a grease fire that was contained in a pan, but I had no lid and couldn't extinguish it so my house filled with smoke...and, it was stressful so I used it as an excuse to smoke "just one" cigarette. This, of course lead back to a pack a day smoking within a week or so.

Fast forward to 12/31... the fire department was leaving my house again. This time because one of my walls was on fire. 
It's still up in the air on the cause. We initially thought electrical short because it started within the wall and (other than the smell) was noticed by smoke coming out of the light switch... but after the firemen took an ax to the wall to put it out, it was determined there was no wiring down at the bottom of the wall where the fire was.

 So "something" could've been smoldering... something like a cigarette. Which, this was right by my back door, and my boyfriend and I smoke on our back porch - so it's very possible it was a cigarette.

We're still pending the final word from the fire Marshall for insurance purposes and whatnot... but in the meantime I decided to quit smoking. Chances are high it was a cigarette, and for all the hundreds of reasons I need to quit... not burning down my house just added to it.

I used one fire to start again, so I'll use the second one to quit for good. 

Thanks for reading!

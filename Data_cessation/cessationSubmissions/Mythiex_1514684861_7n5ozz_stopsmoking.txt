2 weeks...

After not smoking for almost a year, I started smoking again, daily, for the past two weeks. I feel awful about it. I stopped breastfeeding my 6 month old because of it. ( but pumping and dumping because I want to keep breastfeeding)  I hate the smell, I hate having to "take a break" to go out and smoke. I'm hiding it from everyone except my household. 

I'm ashamed of myself. 
I set my new quit day to the 1st. 

I'm not really looking for reply to this. I just kind of needed to say it...

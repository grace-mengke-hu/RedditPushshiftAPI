I was diagnosed with asthma...

Its not emphysema!

I've had trouble breathing for years and with the smoking and seriously compromised breathing systems (I had a lot of surgery for it when I was younger) I just assumed I was doomed to never get a full breath of air again, but it was only sort-of bothering me, not so much that I felt I had to bring it up with my doctor...

So recently I've started working out a lot and would get a tightness in my chest, cough for ages after running and feel that shortness of breath for the entire day after a work out... So I saw my doctor.

(btw just saw I got to 700 yesterday... NEAT!)

A concerned look; "I think you have asthma, we'll put you on an inhaler" 
a rebuttle from me "Are you sure its not emphysema? I did smoke for 10 years..."
"No no no you're too young, but we'll try this and come back in a month..."

Guys.

Guys...

Omg guys...

I can fill up my lungs with air, every single time I need to.
I exercised today and didn't cough.

Guys.

I don't have emphysema!

What has smoking done for ME lately? Nothing. I think it's time.

I'm 25 years old, and I've been smoking for over 10 years. What started as a social habit is now a major vice, and I'm finally sick of it, both physically and mentally. 


After my third round of bronchitis in less than two years, I'm ready to quit. It's scary how shitty I feel, how awful my cough sounds, at such a young age. I know that the cigarettes are to blame. Not to mention the money I'm wasting - where I live, my pack costs anywhere from $10 - $14. I'm spending $50 per week, $200 per month, $2400 per year.... it has to stop.


I'm sick of my friends (who have either quit or never started) get annoyed with my habit. When I have to put a conversation on hold so I can go out for a smoke, when I get into someone's car reeking of it, etc. I know lots of people who have kicked the habit, and while I've been at it much longer than they had, I know I can do it too. The real challenge is going to be dealing with my live in boyfriend, who also smokes. I know we should do this together.


Anyway, I'm really glad I found this community. I've been lurking the threads for a couple of weeks now, and one in particular today really struck a chord - treat your cravings like a little bitch. Next time I'm craving, it's going to be a lot easier to say "NO, you little bitch. Who the fuck do you think you are to tell me what I can and can't do? Fuck off outta here!"


Thanks for reading, looking forward to a cleaner way of living with you guys :)

I guess sometimes it just hits you.

I started smoking a year ago when I was 19. Not much at first, then slowly worked my way up to anywhere from half a pack to a pack a day, not really thinking much of it.

Yesterday I woke up before the sun, poured a cup of coffee, sat myself in my chair on the patio and lit up my morning cigarette. Typically I bring my phone out and browse Reddit or catch up on the news, but for whatever reason yesterday I didn't. Without my phone I inadvertently surrendered myself to my subconscious, which decided to show me an images of myself smoking my morning cigarette every morning, every single morning for the rest of my life, getting older, and older, and older.

Honestly, that kind of scared me a bit - sent a chill down my spine. Is this really how I want to spend every morning for the rest of my life? And every day too... an addiction that will literally stay with me until the day that I die?

Needless to say I put out that cigarette... I didn't pick one up for the rest of the day and haven't touched one today either. 

I've been hanging around this sub for awhile, always the goal of quitting in the back of my mind, just never got around to it. I've "tried" quitting before but just didn't. Don't rush yourself into it. You'll know when you're ready.

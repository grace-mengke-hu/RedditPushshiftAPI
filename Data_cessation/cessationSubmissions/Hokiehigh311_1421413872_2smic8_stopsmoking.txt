Got my 2 week chip today!

This is the first time I've tried cold turkey and it seems like it worked the best.  I am also doing a 21 day cleanse so I had to give up caffeine, alcohol and sugars at the same time.  The first three days were hard but that may be mainly due to caffeine.  I hope when I end the cleanse next week that the I can suppress the urge to smoke!

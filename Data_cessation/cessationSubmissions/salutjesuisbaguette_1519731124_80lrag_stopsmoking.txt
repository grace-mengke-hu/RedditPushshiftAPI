what change of state of mind allowed you to stop smoking ?

Hi guys. It feels a bit strange to post here. Because i never considered my self as addicted. 

I'm 21, I'm a smoker (rolled cigarette or roll up, don't know how to say it, I'm french) since 16 or 17 years old. Sometimes I don't smoke for a month or 2 (or even more) but I always end up buying cigarettes for parties. I feel like I'm missing something to fully enjoy the moment if I don't smoke at parties. And the days after the parties I smoke the end alone.

I also ask friends for cigarettes at uni too, when I see them smoking I can't control myself and have to ask. Even if I said to myself to not smoke that day, I just completely forget it and smoke. Once I asked them some cigarette I buy some to give them back few days later. But I smoke the rest alone again.

The craving is so hard when I see friends around me smoking! Smoking has become a kind of ritual at parties or before lessons.. I can't and don't really want to resist.

I still associate cigarette with pleasure and can't feel to do a complete stop because of that sensation. I know it's the whole point of addictions, to release dopamine, but I feel dumb because it's bad for me but I like it and always want to smoke one to feel right...

I'm always telling me that if I want to stop I can, and that if I'm smoking it's because I want it. But if I look at the past that's simply not true.

So how did you guys get out of that mentality of: smoking = pleasure ? How to quit that state of mind. What did make stop ? 
What was the good/your state of mind that allowed you to stop smoking ?

PS: feel free to correct my English. And sorry for that long post.

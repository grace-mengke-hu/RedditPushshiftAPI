Is it all in my head, or is it really possible for me to be having cravings months after quitting?

I smoked and was a heavy drinker for these last 3 years, and quit a few months ago after my physician had a come to Jesus with me about health issues I've been going through. Long story short, I was told to quit smoking, drinking, and to cut out a lot of stuff from my diet. I was at home with my parents at this point because I temporarily left school for other medical issues, so they were able to be my support system for quitting cold turkey on everything.



Things have been going okay for the most part, and I'm back at a healthy BMI for the first time in a while. I feel better, and I have more energy and I'm really pleased with that.



However, since I've been back in school (my college is on a 3-1-3 calendar, and school started up in January) and the usual stress is back, I find myself really craving to go buy a pack or have a drink. I usually find ways to distract myself from this by playing a video game or going on a walk, but it doesn't help all that much because I still feel frustrated, even if it's only in the back of my head. I don't really have a support system here, but I don't want to have to rely on other people to help me do what's best for myself. 


Is it just all in my mind, or is this normal? I knew that quitting was hard but I was not expecting it to be this difficult.

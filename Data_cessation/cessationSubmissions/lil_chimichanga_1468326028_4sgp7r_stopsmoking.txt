Week One - DONE!

Hey everyone!

Just wanted to come and update on how my first week went. I told myself not to post anything until I hit that mark so here I am.

A little background: I've smoked since I was 18 (I'm 25 now.) I was pretty good about only smoking between 6-10 cigarettes a day. My friends and family hated it, and if I'm really being honest with myself, I hate it too! I don't like the taste of "my brand," I don't like being outside alone, I don't like waking up feeling like an ashtray if I smoked too soon before bed. Smoking just sucks so here we are.

Week one has been good. I'm really struggling with the physical act of not smoking. I start to go crazy when I'm driving anywhere because my hands feel use less. My mouth gets this weird feeling when I'm watching tv and a commercial break comes on as if it's begging for a cigarette. I'm not experiencing any of the common withdrawal symptoms, but I credit that entirely to the Nicoderm Patch i religiously apply every morning.

My tips would be just to stay physically and mentally active this first week (it REALLY helped Pokemon Go came out on my quit day in the US because I'm walking and hunting, not even thinking about cigs.) I've also developed a serious Dum Dum lollipop addiction from using them when I drive, but hey, at least I'm trying.

EDIT: I am also using the Kwit app. I like the progress dashboard on it a lot, and I really like that it's sort of set up like a game. The ads are annoying, but I highly recommend using it as a tracker during your quit (you can pay for a version without ads. I'm just cheap.)

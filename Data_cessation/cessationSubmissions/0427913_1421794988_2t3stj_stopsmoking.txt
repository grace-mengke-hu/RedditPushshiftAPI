My Weekend Lapse involved a philosophical debate with the checkout assistant

So i lapsed on the weekend after getting very drunk, however, r/stopsmoking might appreciate the scenario.

My friend ran ahead and asked the checkout girl NOT to serve me cigarettes as i was trying to quit.

(Enter, young man, pissed out of his face)
"Can i have a ten pack of royals please?"
The attractive lady working the counter replies"No, sorry"
"Ahhh, ok can i have a ten pack of benson and hedges gold please?"
"No, im afraid not"
"But i can see them there?"
"Yes, i know, but you friend told me not to sell you any as your trying to quit"
"Oh bless him, no its okay, can i get a lighter aswell please"
"He told me not too, would you rather an e-cig"
"Umm... maybe...actually no can i have the royals?"
"Smokings bad for you and your doing so well"
"Yea but im drunk, im not addicted anymore im just out for the night"
"Are you SURE you wouldn't prefer an ecig"
"Yea im sure, thank you though for trying to help"
"Ohhh please dont make do this"
"Im sorry, im weak, i probably wont even smoke them"

Serves me the cigarettes, soon as i leave the shop, light one up.

30 minutes later im violently sick and home, yet paraletic and vomitting, before midnight, miss my lectures the next morning. 

Tl;Dr - Dont fucking smoke. Peace.

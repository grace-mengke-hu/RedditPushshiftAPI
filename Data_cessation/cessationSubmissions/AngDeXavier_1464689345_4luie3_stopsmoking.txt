A slip can be just that (keep on quitting)

On Saturday, just as I hit the 2 month mark, I went to a party. At said party I partied hearty. And smoked. In total about 4 full ciggies. Two, having drags here and there and two whole ones as the night wore on. 

Deep into Sunday morning I started questioning whether this meant that this quit attempt was over (and should I therefore go buy a box). And then I thought fuck that. That's the kind of addictive thinking that kept me a smoker for 18 years. In fact, I'd been having a tough time for the past week, maybe that motivated my actions at that party, with the nicotine monster behind the slip in the hopes of this very response.

Aside from a few physical pangs for the past few days, my resolve is actually back to full strength thanks to the slip. 

Has anyone else experienced this? Do you disagree and think I need to reset my badges everywhere?

Has anyone used chantix as a way of stopping smoking?

I'm 23 I've been smoking since I was 16 and I really want to quit I hate waking up in the morning hacking up a lung or feeling like going up stairs is a real workout, not to mention my brand of cigarettes is almost 8$ a pack now. So I went to my doctor on Tuesday and he told me for other medical reasons not to start the chantix he prescribed me for another two weeks. Has anyone had any luck with this stuff? I'm really excited to use it and free myself from the chains of smoking.

Ending week one afraid!

Today is day 8. I've officially been smoke free for a week! I am a bit scared about the coming days as I have been told that week two is hell. Any tips to get through this? I haven't told anyone, not even my husband, that I'm quitting and my cravings are sneaking up on me out of nowhere. I've had some grumpy days and don't want this to displace other things in my life so any advice on week two madness would be much appreciated!

Quitting smoking, 3rd attempt.

Hey guys! 

So, today I'm quitting, Its my 3rd attempt.

The other 2 happened this last 2 years. The first one I lasted 1 month but went for an hike with my family, who are really heavy smokers, and ended up smoking again. The second lasted little over 2 weeks, and started smoking on a night out with friends. 

I have several triggers to smoke during the day: Meal times, commune to work, work itself and while I'm on my PC. 

My major problem to be honest will be handling work. EVERYONE smokes in there. It's so hard to spend 11h at a place, where everyone is smoking and you're not. 

What are your suggestions? And congrats on everyone trying to quit!

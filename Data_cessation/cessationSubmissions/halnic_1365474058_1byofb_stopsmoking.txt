My biggest problem so far has actually been sensitivity to smells that seem stronger than before.

I have a pretty tough stomach and threshold, but since I quit everything from fast food to road kill to other people make me gag if there is a smell. Kinda sucks since I work in the public and everyone has a smell. Plus my husband after a smoke is awful. Need some nose plugs. Anyone else experiencing this? Also lost job today, no relapse.

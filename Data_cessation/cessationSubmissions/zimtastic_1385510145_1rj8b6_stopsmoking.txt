Day 3 - cravings are less intense, but when will I stop thinking about smoking all the time? Also, where the hell is my focus?

So I'm on day 3, and I'm no longer hallucinating about cigarettes (seriously).  When will I stop thinking about smoking all the time?  The cravings are way less intense, but all the time I keep thinking about smoking, and when I can get back to it.  Like my brain is telling me this has been fun, but seriously now, let's go get a pack so we can get on with life.

Also, I had been learning how program/code before this, and now I'm having some trouble focusing/getting my mind back into it.  Has anyone else experienced something similar?

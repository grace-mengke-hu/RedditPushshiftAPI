Day 5 is a giant anxiety attack

New here. I desperately need a community that understands this. 

Days 1-3 I did great and stayed strong, chewing on AirHeads and grapes any time I craved (ALL DAY) 

Day 4, I smoked 3. When I say ALL DAY ANXIETY ATTACK.... that's what it was. And I'm moving forward.

Today is day 5 and AGAIN, I can't ... I don't know how to NOT go outside and smoke. I'm really struggling. 

Is this anxiety, shaking, crying, from withdrawals? Or was I just dealing / masking this every day by smoking? 

I'm really struggling here.

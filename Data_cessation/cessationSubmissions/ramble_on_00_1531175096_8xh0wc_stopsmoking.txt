Nicotine path on prescription!!!

Just a heads up, I had successfully quit one in the past using patches for upto a year (3 month of patch usage). Recently started my hopefully final quit and consulted the doctor during a visit. She thought my insurance may cover it so wrote a prescription for it. Went to get it filled at the local Walgreens fully expecting to pay the full amount and lo and behold 1 month of 21mg + 1 month refills were covered 100&amp;#37;. Not that this was a deciding factor (80 dollars for a month of patches vs 400 dollars a month on cigarettes), but definitely a nice surprise.

I would recommend checking with your doctor and having them write a prescription. Worst case, you still have to pay the full amount that you were planning to anyway

Quit update- on day 31, have been able to resist all habit based urges (after meals, drinks etc.) Got drunk at a 4th of July BBQ and didn't smoke a single cigarette.

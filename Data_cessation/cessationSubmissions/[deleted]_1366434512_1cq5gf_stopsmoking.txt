First 24 days.

Surprisingly, I made it 3+ weeks of non-smoking. I first quit for a girl. I thought might be a possible girlfriend. She helped with the first week of non-smoking, but then she ended our relationship. I decided to keep up with quitting smoking because I have been wanting to quit for quite some time now. BTW, I am still using the E-cig. After the first week, I felt great. On top of the world. Now, I still feel great, but it is still a constant struggle not to buy a pack. I don't have many friends that know I am quitting, so I do not get as much recognition for not smoking. It is a daily battle I fight, by myself, and every day makes me feel stronger and better about myself.

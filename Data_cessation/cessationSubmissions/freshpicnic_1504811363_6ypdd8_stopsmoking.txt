Could use some advice (20 days in)

As the title says, I'm currently 20 days in on my smoke-free journey. This is the furthest I've gone without smoking since I started around a year ago. Everything was going well, I hit one week, then two weeks, and it really made me feel happy about myself. However, for some reason now those feelings of achievement seem to be slipping away. I can't help but think back to all the positive memories I've had whilst smoking and it really takes its toll on me. In fact, for the past two nights I've dreamt about smoking and I find it strange that these symptoms only seem to be appearing now. 

So, my question is how do you keep motivating yourself to stay smoke-free? Thanks.

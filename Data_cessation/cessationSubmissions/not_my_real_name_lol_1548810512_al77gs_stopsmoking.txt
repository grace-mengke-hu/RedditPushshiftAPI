Addicted to the habbit, not necessarily the nicotine

For me, I don't really get nicotine cravings. I can go a couple of days without smoking no problem (especially after a hungover day), but eventually I just get this want to smoke. 

I'll be walking to work and think "a fag would be nice", or Ill be at the pub having a drink and again I relate the two activities to smoking 

I went about a month without properly smoking (I had about 3 in that time frame when offered on nights out), but then bought a pack 2 weeks ago. Since then I've smoked 4 packs and recently bought a bag of baccy. 

I really want to quit, I'm almost 23 and know this is just the stupidest thing I can do to my body (especially with my poor diet and lack of exercise) but having the self control to say no when I have that desire is really hard. 

Any feedback would be appreciated, thank you

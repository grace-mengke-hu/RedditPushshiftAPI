Hoping this is it for good- I feel like it is. I have learned that just one turns Into a full blown Relapse as is evidenced by the timeline above. Itâ€™s my reminder to not even think I can have one because it will turn into many, many more and starting over on day 1 is the hardest part. Best of luck to you all!

Starting my final quit!

My habit has been at a pack a day for over 5 years now.  I've "quit" twice before, once for 2 weeks and once for two months.  I am trying the patch this go round as the last few times I was incredibly irritable and moody.

Don't mind having to deal with the cravings, but I just don't want to be a jerk to my friends.  Can I still use the badges, even though I'm not really nicotine free yet?

It's time to chew bubble gum and smoke cigarettes,... and I'm all out of cigarettes.  :)

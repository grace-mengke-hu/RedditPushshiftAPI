This seriously happened!

Today is Day 3 for me! I literally sat at a green light wondering why people were beeping at me. I actually looked at the fuckn light and it still didn't compute in my brain. How does quitting make you turn into a total dumbass and just forget so much? Shouldn't these things happen when you start not when trying to quit!?! Please tell me I'm not the only person this ridiculous shit happens to. Feel like I'm soooo losing my mind, wtf?

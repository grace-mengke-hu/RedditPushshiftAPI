Quitting tips with another smoker in the house?

So I’m 22/F, located in the USA, been a pack a day smoker for the past 2 years. I recently moved in with my dad (who is smoke free coming up on one year) and his girlfriend who is the same. I’m going through the state free quit line and I have 4 weeks of patches sitting in front of me right now, and one more cigarette. 

I know I haven’t been a smoker as long as many of you. I know I’m too young to be this addicted to something, and I don’t want to be too old in a few years! Plus this affects my every day life—shortness of breath, can’t exercise like I used to, constantly planning out my day so I can keep my fix alive. Not to mention it’s horrible on my body. I wanna be independent of this thing. 

I tried quitting cold turkey over the winter and it was harder than I imagined it could be. So now I’m going with the patches, also got the Smoke Free app. 

The thing is, I wanted to ask if any of you have quit with another smoker still in the house? My younger brother (21/M) still smokes a pack a day, and up till today we have been smoking a lot together. It doesn’t help that we both love the same type of menthols. The fact that the smokes are there, that I’m going to see him go outside for a smoke break (we don’t smoke indoors), and smell it on him constantly has me worried. Any tips on how to deal with this? 

Already bought a few packs of gum and a fidget spinner for the times I usually smoke. I’m thinking I can get up and walk around, too, and remove myself from the area when my bro smokes. I have no idea how easy or difficult it will be to resist, so I come here asking advice and any other tips I might have forgotten. Thanks so much.

Yep, I'm done.

Two days ago I pondered if I was ready. I decided today I am ready. Yesterday I had my last cigarette, and managed to convince my fiancee to quit with me. So, we got this, together. I feel okay, had some minor irritability and a bit of the jitters in the car (car rides always equaled smoke time!). I am currently trying to steel my nerves for the coming work week, and beyond. Here we go!

Just quit last night.

My girlfriend and I were out having a smoke and suddenly in a fit of drunken rage at our sore chests we both decided to take out our packs and destroy every cigarette one at a time.  

Today has been slightly difficult, not as hard as previous attempts at quitting actually.  No headaches, no phlegm.  The only real issue is my anxiety is through the roof.  Everything has been freaking me out today.

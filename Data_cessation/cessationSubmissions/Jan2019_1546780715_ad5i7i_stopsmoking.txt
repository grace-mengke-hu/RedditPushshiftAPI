I know this sounds weird, but...

...maybe it will help someone. I quit smoking Jan 2. The first day was so rough I didn’t think I was going to make it. I’m 56 years old and I started smoking at 14, so it is truly a lifetime habit. On day two I took out the insides of a regular Bic pen (just a plain stick pen), so all I had left was a hollow tube. I stuffed a cotton ball on the inside. When I find myself losing my mind for for the whole ritual of a smoke, I “smoke” my pen. And I literally go through the motions. I pretend to light it, I hold it exactly like a cigarette, I inhale and exhale exactly the way I did with a cigarette, etc. It has made all the difference for me. Why the cotton ball? Because without it, the tube is too open, the air flows too easily. With it, you get a similar drag to a cigarette. But careful - make sure the cotton is packed tightly or you’ll suck it right through! 😬 Yikes, not pleasant! 

Good luck everybody!

3 days 10h and 15m without smoking and the cravings are killing meee

Agh, so this is my 4th time quitting and hopefully the last. I’ve been vaping with a shitty 7/11 vape, which has substantially helped the cravings, but my last cartridge just ran out and I’m too broke to buy more (hell yeah, college student life). 

What are the best ways to get through the cravings? I’m so tempted to go outside and bum a smoke from someone, but I also know that I don’t really want to do that. Nicotine is a powerful drug y’all :/

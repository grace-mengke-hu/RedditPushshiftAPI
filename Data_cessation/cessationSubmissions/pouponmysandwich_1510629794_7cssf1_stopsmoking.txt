Day 15 smoke free after five years.

It's been rough as I'm surrounded by smokers everywhere, but I feel great. Definitely been rough. Staying positive helps. 

Today was the first time I smelled cigarette smoke on my clothes after spending time at a buddy's house. Grossed me out, so thats definitely an improvement. 

The time period between thinking about having a cigarette is getting farther apart as well. Woohoo!

Getting easier every day. We can do it!

Stopping for the Nth time

The nasty taste and horrible smells that smoking has produced in my life was enough to make me want to stop smoking a long time ago. I even purchased a full set of nicotine patches because I knew this day would eventually arrive. After smoking 2 packs daily over the last year and a half, I've decided to ride the patch again. Yesterday I did not have a single cigarette and I lived! I won't have the luxury of removing myself from the smokers table because I work in the retail industry where everyone comes in to purchase cigarettes or other tobacco products, so this time, I'm going to try to face it head on and spend time around those that continue to smoke. I am very fortunate in that my wife was sick enough this week that she also quit smoking cold turkey forcing me to ramp up my time frame to personally quit. 
I lost my momma this year to advanced lung disease and it has been the worse experience in my life. As a 41 year old man who has been around the block at least once, I had no clue how much losing my mother would affect everyday life. I know that I can not protect my daughter from the pangs of watching a parent pass away, but with a little luck and grit, I will at least stay the door for a few minutes longer. I do this to save my life for my daughter who doesn't talk to me, my mother who was my best friend, and my future grandchild that may never get to know me.

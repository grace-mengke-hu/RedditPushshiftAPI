Day 5 - going thru hell

I’m struggling worse than I ever have right now, and I’m only 5 days in from quitting cold turkey. I want a cigarette so badly. I’m missing my soon to be ex wife, and that fact only compounds the problem. I feel so... lost. I feel like I will never be the same without nicotine.

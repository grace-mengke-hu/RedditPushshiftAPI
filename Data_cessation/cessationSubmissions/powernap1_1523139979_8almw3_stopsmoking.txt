Does vaping help? Need advice.

I have been spending the last 18 days with family, they don't know I smoke so for the time being I've quit cold turkey. I'd like to quit for good, but am worried that as soon as I go back to university, I'll fall back into my old habits of smoking a pack a day (as I've done after previous family visits). Even though at this point I have no strong cravings, I'm worried my regular surroundings and smoker friends will get me back into it; I have zero self control and know I couldn't just be a social smoker, or just have one or two a day. So I've been thinking about getting a vape to help me transition, and was wondering if anyone has advice on whether vaping actually helps. 
P.S. I know there's a lot of stigma around vaping being lame, but I'm okay with that, if that means I can stop smoking for good.

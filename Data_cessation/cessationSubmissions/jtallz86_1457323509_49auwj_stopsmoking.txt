3 months today

Today I'm officially 3 months removed from my last puff of a cigarette and thereby my last dose of nicotine. Figured I'd post some unsolicited thoughts to mark the occasion.

  I only rarely think about having a cigarette, and I wouldn't even call those cravings anymore. Just simple thoughts. 

  I've always had a bit of nervous anxiety and fairly regular existential crises. I smoked through them all. While Im much more level headed and less reactive than before, my mental health woes haven't seemed to regulate as quickly as I'd hoped, but I'm still glad to be smoke free. Spring is coming and with it my graduation from graduate studies- so things should start looking up on their own.

 My kids love that I'm quit. My 12 year old now cuddles me again. I thought she'd outgrown me but it turns out I just smelled repulsive to her. My 3 year old comments on how "you don't have cig-etts anymore. You won't die."
 At least not for a while, kid.

 My husband still smokes, and I hate the smell of him. I'm not sure I'll get used to that, but he's cut down a lot so maybe I won't have to. 

I'm much more confident and focussed at work and school. No longer stinking up the conference room or rushing oUT at the end of meetings to get to my smokes.

Here's hoping I keep up this quit until the end.

Tl;Dr reflections on 3 months quit. Mostly good, but not without some difficulties.

543 Days completely smoke free.

Just wanted to touch base with you all, I am still smoke free after all these days!  It feels amazing and surreal, I didn't think I would make it this far.  Oddly enough when I quit smoking my drinking slowed way down as well.  Now I rarely drink and when I do it's only a little bit, like 1 beer at a friends house.  Even the couple of times I have gone out for a couple drinks smoking hasn't tempted me.  I am extremely thankful to have found the strength within myself to quit and stay quit.

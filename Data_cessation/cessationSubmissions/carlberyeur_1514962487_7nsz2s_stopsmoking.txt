I'm not a smoker anymore

I quit smoking this summer, after smoking six or so years. It was really hard and after the physical cravings "the minor depression" took over. But I kept going and it turned around and got better and better. I stopped envying smokers on parties and this new year's day, I realized that I hadn't even wanted to have a smoke at new year's eve, even though at least half of the people at the party smoked. I realized this morning that I am not a smoker anymore, I made it out. And we can all do it. I know this subreddit has helped me enormously and I owe you all my gratitude, and in a sense my life! Thank you very much and I wish you all the best luck on your journeys :)

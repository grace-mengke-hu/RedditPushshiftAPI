I've tried quitting several times, my story...started smoking at 23 on vacation, ended up getting addicted, although I just recently accepted that. I'm 35 now, will be 36 next month. I have 4 children, and one on the way...and I have a lot to live for. I'm ready to learn better ways to cope...cause I'm a stresser...while I've gotten better...I stress, so much so that I grind my teeth in my sleep, and I have high blood pressure. And I'd like to get off the meds they have me on...next appointment with the doctor is the 12th, and I want to be smoke free. Well...that's me! I thought I'd get better results with a support circle...one thing I never tried.

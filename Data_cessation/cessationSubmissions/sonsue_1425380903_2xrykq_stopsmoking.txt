Fellow Quitters, I need your help.

During the course of my quit I have learned a lot of interesting facts about the science behind nicotine addiction. Many of these facts I have shared with a nurse friend of mine (quitter of 15 years) and she had never heard of them. She has asked me to compile a list of some of these lesser known but quantifiable truths and I am asking for your help. I would like to avoid any anecdotal "truths" and stick with things that can be sourced.

For instance: 
A 2013 Gallup poll shows that 48% of successful quitters did so using the cold turkey method. ( I will then source the comment)

XXX study has shown blood sugar can drop drastically within the first 72 hours of smoking.

Anything you have would be really helpful. This is something she will use in her office to help people like us kick the habit. Of course when it is complete I will also compile a list it and post it here.

Keep kicking ass!

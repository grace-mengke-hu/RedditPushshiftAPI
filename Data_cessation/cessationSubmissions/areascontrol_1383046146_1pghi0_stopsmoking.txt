Night smoking :(

I started stopping last week, Monday, I think.  I am a homemaker with no cigarettes/ patches/ e-cigs in the house.  If I want cigs, I have to drive about 10 minutes to get a pack.  Haven't done it.  

Here's the problem:  My husband smokes.  He's been REALLY good about not smoking in the house or in front of me.  Keeps his smokes out of sight, and so on.  The problem is that just knowing he has cigarettes is a huge trigger for me.  The longest I've gone so far is 29 hours.  I did poorly weekend evenings and poorly last night- about 6 cigs between 6pm and bedtime.  I'm so disappointed in myself.  I didn't smoke a single cig during the day even though I was out and about with my 81 year old day all day (talk about a trigger!).  

How can I do better?  I'm afraid the increased smoking at night is going to lead to smoking full time again.  Oh.  I should also add that I'm paying him 50 cents per cig- we're in NY so he's not price gouging me lol.  Sunday evening, I had lost count of how much I owed him so I bought him a pack.  Troll brain now knows that I'm flush/ he owes me some cigs.  Basically I found a sneaky way to buy myself cigarettes.  Grrrr. Stupid!

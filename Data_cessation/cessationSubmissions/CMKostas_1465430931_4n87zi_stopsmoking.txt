2 collapsed lungs and finally i got my badge!

I wanna quit! I want it for a long time but could never really do it. 

Even after I had my lung collapse 2 times I still couldnt do it but today is the day I quit! Ive had a pneumothorax 2 times already and after both times I stopped for 1 month and started again afterwards. 
I need to stop. I have been suffering from nerve damage and paranoia cause of my lungs and I still somehow cant quit smoking. I know it sounds stupid but my fight against cigarettes is the hardest thing to accomplish in my life.

Starting TODAY I am a non-smoker!

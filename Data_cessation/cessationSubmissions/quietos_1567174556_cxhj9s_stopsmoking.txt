Has anyone had experience with Nicotine gum/lozenges?

I smoked for about 4 years, and then switched to vaping which got me off the cancer sticks for an entire year now. I'm ready to drop vaping now as well; I am tired of the way my lungs feel and my general health. Has anyone tried gum or lozenges, and how well did they work for you?

Thanks in advance!

Smoker for about 2 years, how long do you need to be hooked to experience withdrawals?

I started smoking in college. I never really experienced cravings, I saw it as a filler for when I was bored (walking to class, etc.) Maybe that was how I masked cravings to myself. Anyway, I was just wondering for anybody who is a long time smoker, is two years of semi-consistent smoking enough to experience craving and withdrawals when quitting? I haven't had a cigarette in 11 days now, and I don't have any physical symptoms. Sure I've wanted one, especially on the job (EMT), but it hasn't been overpowering. I have read places that cold turkey is no good, but it seems fine so far. Am I wrong? Thanks guys, good luck on your journeys as well!

Three weeks in and big victory yesterday

Hit the three week milestone yesterday. Still having some thoughts and cravings but I have found the third week easier than the second and the second easier than the first, really hope  this trend continues! 

So yesterday morning was waking to the bus stop and a girl in front of me was smoking roll ups, which I used to smoke and have always preferred the smell of. Some smoke went into my face and instead of liking the smell and having a craving or feeling jealous, it stank. And I thought “urgh, imagine having to smoke at this time of the morning”. 

It was about 20 past 8 and I would have smoked 2 or even 3 cigarettes by that time when I was still smoking. I got a flash back of sometimes feeling sick or dizzy with that first cigarette but still choking it down because I was craving.

First proper “yippee I’m a non smoker” thought, really hoping to have more and more.

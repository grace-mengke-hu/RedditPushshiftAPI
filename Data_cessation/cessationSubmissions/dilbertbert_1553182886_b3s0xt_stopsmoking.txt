I'm waiting for the day to come that I don't think about having a cigarette, does that day ever come?

So, I'm 76 days quit and I'm thrilled but not a day has gone by that I haven't had the desire for a cigarette cross my mind.  

Is this the way things will always be or will eventually a day come that I don't have an urge to smoke?  If this is the way things will always be, I believe I can better adjust to the situation if I know in advance.

If you have days without the urge to smoke, how far in were you when you experienced your first?

Serial quitting

I've been trying almost constantly to quit for months. The longest I made it was 12 days after finishing Allen Carr's book, but I gave in when I was drinking that night and since then I've only been able to go a couple of days at a time. My SO thinks I haven't smoked at all in a long time and I really hate that I've been hiding this secret and desperately want to stop. Should I try reading the book again and avoid alcohol this time? I started reading it again a while back but stopped about a quarter or so of the way through. Or should I try something else entirely? I feel pretty desperate and I guess I'm mostly hoping that actually writing all this somewhere will partially lift the weight or something.

Also ignore my badge, I haven't bothered to update it with each attempt in a while.

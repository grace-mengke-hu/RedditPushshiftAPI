Tapering?

Well, I've tried quitting cigs before but never lasted too long. I was thinking about trying to gradually taper down and try to focus on times when I habitually smoke. Like I am thinking step one will be not to have a cigarette right after sex, my next step will be avoiding the usual post meal cigarette, and over time addressing all of these usual moments. This alone would help me cut back quite a bit.. I've also considered just tapering down as usual, a small bit less each day.

Has anyone had success with long tapering plans? I know some people drastically lower their use day to day and I am intending to make the process a bit longer. I am doing this as I'm still working through two other pretty big drug addictions. It isn't the best idea to add much more to the mix but I'd like to think with a gradual enough taper plan it wouldn't be too bad. Anybody had success like this?

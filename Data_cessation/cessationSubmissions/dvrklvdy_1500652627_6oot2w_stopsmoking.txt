Halfway through a month!

It's been easy for me to quit with a baby on the way. Just reminding myself that he or she will really appreciate starting his or her life with a healthy mom. When I can breathe deeply and not feel my breath quicken is another great reminder. The app Smoke Free has actually been very helpful with daily goals. It helps break it down instead of looking at the daunting task of "QUIT SMOKING". I haven't had many cravings, which I know is rare so I'm very thankful that this has been a relatively easy process. This being the second time I've really tried to quit, I know the difference is not only being pregnant but I actually WANT to quit. Here's to 18 days, completely smoke free!

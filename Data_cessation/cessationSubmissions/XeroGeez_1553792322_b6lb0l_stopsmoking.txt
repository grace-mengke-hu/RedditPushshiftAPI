1 month, 18 day

1 month, 18 days, longer than its ever been.

I've never posted here before, just lurked, but I felt like I've made it far enough to have street cred to speak up on it. I had been smoking for about a decade, started very young, and it had gotten to the point that I always noticed how smoking just made me tired afterward and I couldn't stand the feeling anymore.

So I bought some nicotine gum (sidebar: I had tried to quit cold turkey many times before. Never worked. This timebi used the gum for a few weeks and it was disgusting, but I think it really helped. Don't be afraid to ease off) and only had one relapse since then, but I didn't beat myself up like I did in times past, and as a result I think it was easier not to relapse. It was just a mistake on my longer journey, not a game ending failure. 

Anyway, my purpose for posting this is that the other day I was thinking about cigarettes and realized that I hadn't really done that in recent memory. No cigarette thoughts, no cravings, maybe a passing thought but never any hang up on the subject. I couldn't stop myself from laughing a good bit in that bathroom because it felt a bit surreal after all these years of addiction.

So yeah, it hasn't even been that long for me but its already leagues better. Hang in there, everyone.

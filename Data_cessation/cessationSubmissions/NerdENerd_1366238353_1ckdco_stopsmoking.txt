Starting to feel good today

The last week has been tough but today I feel like I am getting better. I have slept properly for the last two nights, the coughing and sore throat are getting better and I am feeling nowhere near as tired. The best part is how easy cycling to work is getting, I have a two kilometre hill climb at the end of my ride to work and I can feel the extra oxygen getting through my system.

The first two weeks are hell and you feel like crap but there is light at the end of the tunnel and the reward is totally worth those few weeks of physical pain and misery.

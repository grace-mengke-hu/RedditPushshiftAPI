Day 22

Feeling a little better this am after the first day of antibiotics (had a serious cough and finally went to the dr yesterday).

I’m going to take a nice walk outside this am and breath deep. I’m so grateful I’ve mustered the courage to choose health over smoking cigarettes. Thank you all for the support.  And I’m proud of all of us for the tenacity to stick to this effort.

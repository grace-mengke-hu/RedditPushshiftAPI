Cravings while drinking

I quit smoking for 1 year now.  Quitting smoking was one of the hardest things I've ever done and I never thought it would be.  The first couple weeks I was such a bitch not purposely but I was so hard to be around my boyfriend and my friends were not affraid to forwarded tell me so and as much as it might have hurt I appreciated their honesty.  Recently I have started to struggle with smoking while drinking...  Though I only smoke 2 or 3 cigarettes when drunk I still wale up the next day thinking "why the fuck did I smoke last night".  I don't crave smoking when I'm sober... On fact I sont even think about it.  When I go out and get drunk (only takes me 3 drinks)  my inhibitions are gone I no longer think clearly my friend go for a smoke and I go with them without a Care. I say this because I am currently struggling  with the same issue...  And I read the comments and majority of people are saying don't drink do put yourself in the situation....  Honestly I like drinking I enjoy my friends even if they smoke, yes maybe they aren't a good I fluency on me maybe seeing them smoke is making me have the urge to engage with them but I also recently have been thinking...  711 sells nicotine free electronic cigarettes that's what I used to quit in the first place,  it was not easy but I'm thinking I should by more (they sell them in packs of 2 for 11$ and they are flavoured)  they may not have nicotine but it helps with the feeling and habitual habit of putting something to your lips.  I know this will help me so maybe it will help you.  Good luck and know you're not the only one struggling it's ok to make mistakes everyone does even I'm having a hard time...  Don't stop trying though you'll get it eventually and occasional failure is only human,  just don't give up ;)

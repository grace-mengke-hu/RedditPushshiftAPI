390 days - Reset

I have been messing around since I return to work full time tomorrow and we'll... I had a cigarette. Drunk. Felt good at the time. Hope I don't crave to hard from just one. It wasn't all that special and tbh I'm glad I have chosen to become a non smoker becuSe Jesus they smell bad and the rush is short lived. Keep on quitting my friends!

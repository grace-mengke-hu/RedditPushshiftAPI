Just passing a very strong craving

It's the 5th day of my quitting. I have been a smoker for seven years. Today i woke up with such a heavy headache and nausea....Somehow i passed half the day but then i had lunch. Now, I always used to smoke after a meal and this triggered my craving. This craving made me shiver and somehow like "Tweek" from south park..I am so anxious right now that I decided to post here to act as a distraction. But my teeth are having a smoking sensation that they need some nicotine. Hopefully i will get through today as well. I thank this community where I stumbled upon accidentally and watching so many people quit inspired me to do the same. Thanks for reading this.

Day 6....not feeling great

I've been smoking for 8 years. Today is day 6 of no smoking. My life is not very stress free between work, college studies, finances, family, and my relationship. Today is one of those days where a lot of bad shit happens. Every area, something bad has happened and smoking always gave me a chance to relax for a minute, think, and eased the stress through. Learning to handle things is proving to be more difficult. I feel like creaking and saying fuck it smoking right now. I probably won't, but man does that sound nice with everything wrong going on right now.

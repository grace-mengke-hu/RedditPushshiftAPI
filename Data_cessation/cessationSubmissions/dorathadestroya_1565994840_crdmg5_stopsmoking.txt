I ordered Nicoderm CQ patches today.

I’ve been smoking a total of 10 years, between half a pack to a full pack a day. I don’t want to rely on a vape because I don’t think they’re very good for you either and I don’t think I’d be able to quit cold turkey. My cousin really recommended trying the patch, so I’m giving it a go. Wish me luck guys!

Its day one for me and I want nothing more than to earn that star.

It seems odd that it took me 15 years to realize that as a habit it sucks. Costs money, makes everything smell bad in my flat and that's just the start of the negative's list. I don't want to say much but r/stopsmoking is the inspiration for me quitting so I thought I'd leave my mark here on day one.

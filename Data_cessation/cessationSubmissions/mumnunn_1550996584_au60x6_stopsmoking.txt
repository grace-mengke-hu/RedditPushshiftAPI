Slipped day 10

Not happy with me but its happened, stupid stupid thing to do. I couldn't cope with my pain, it was awful, I was awful, for a brief few seconds it seemed to help, then proper head kicked in.. Of course it didn't help! What I should have done was just stop trying to carry on, rested, see breathed and taken extra pain killers which would have sent me to zzz. So here I am on what would have been day 11,having to restart diary, and brain. I know I don't want this stinky controlling habit, I know how easy it is to relapse, well it wasn't I did put up a fight, but it' was stronger than I,. Reset restart, never let guard down. Have a good day all

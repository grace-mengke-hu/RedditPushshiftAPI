Does anyone miss the romanticism of smoking?

This sounds super dumb and is such a superficial reason to stop smoking, but does anyone miss the romantic feeling of smoking? When I quit/imagine my future not smoking, not smoking day to day doesn’t bother me; it’s missing a cigarette in a specifically cigarette worthy moment. I envisage a cigarette and a glass of wine on a balcony in Italy, or a cigarette on a boat at sunset etc. and that makes me not want to quit. It sounds so stupid, but one of my biggest hangups is missing out on a cigarette worthy moment.

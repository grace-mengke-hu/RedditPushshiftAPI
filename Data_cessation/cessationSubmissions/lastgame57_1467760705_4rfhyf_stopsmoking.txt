I have tried, and tried, but this time it is going better

I started my trek to not smoking on the first of July. Thankfully, those that are around me are supportive, and help me with things to do other than smoke. 

I have been sleeping a lot, so that is  taking my motivation to self task. Does anyone have things that keep them from having urges to smoke while alone?

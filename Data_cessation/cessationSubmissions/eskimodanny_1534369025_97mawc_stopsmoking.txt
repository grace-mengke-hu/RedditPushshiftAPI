28th day and it's the worst one yet

My quit has actually been fairly easy until today. I woke up with a minor headache, an itchy throat, and have had brain fog all day at work. Blah. I don't feel "all there" and the worst part is that I don't have anyone to talk about this about!

Thankfully I can post about this here :) 

I'm just waiting for the fog to lift. I'm hoping it's soon. Anyone experience similar symptoms around this time in their quit?

What do you like or dislike about nicotine gum specifically?

I see a lot of posts about using nicotine gum as part of a quit strategy and would love to know more about what people like or don't like about it. For those of you who have tried nicotine gum specifically, can you tell me a little about your experience? What brand did you use and how much / for long? What did you like or dislike about the experience? Interested to learn more, so thanks in advance!

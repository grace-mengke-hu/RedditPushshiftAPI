Day 15

Over two weeks smoke free! I still can't believe I've made it this far. I can't believe how my health has improved. The other day, I ran just over 3 miles in under 25 min and didn't feel like dying! When I smoked and worked out, I always felt there was a "wall" that I would hit; that I couldn't improve more. No matter how much I worked out while smoking, I never felt like I made progress. Sure, I lost weight like I wanted to, but I know that smoking kept me from the fitness level that I desired. After being smoke free for this long, I feel like that limiter has been removed. The fitness bump has been huge. The physical benefits are keeping me motivated and preventing me from falling off the wagon. 

Mentally, its been a different story. For me, getting the nicotine out of my system was the easy part. I still struggle with cravings (which is a given) and have been attempting to find ways to cope with these triggers. Some nights I have trouble falling asleep because for years, I ended my day with a smoke. When I was stumped on a project at work, I would take a break and smoke a cig in my car to clear my mind. When I got off work, the first thing I would do after getting to my car was to light one up. I find that chewing straws (what my dad used to quit chewing tobacco) on the ride home does wonders. That and lots of cinnamon gum. I don't understand the science behind it, but cinnamon flavored gum helps with cravings.  It keeps me occupied and takes my mind off it. Its hard to take something out of your life that's been part of your daily routine for years. 

Have I thought about giving up? Hell yes I have. Some of the cravings I get make me feel like ripping my hair out and smashing my head against a wall simultaneously. But I know it gets better, and I want to get better, so I march on. I haven't felt this great in years and when the nicotine man comes knocking, I tell him to go fuck himself.

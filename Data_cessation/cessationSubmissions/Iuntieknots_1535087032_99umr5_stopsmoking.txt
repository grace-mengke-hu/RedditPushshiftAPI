Day 1 of the Journey

Hey  there kind people,

&amp;#x200B;

I had put on a post yesterday, describing how hard it is to call quits, how to find the motivation and how am i gonna chart out the way to quitting when deep down i don't want or feel unable to quit. I guess the only easy way out would be to take you people as the support system and quit cold turkey. Long back (2 years) i had done the same, quit cold turkey and remained the same. I am going on the same path again. Thank you for all the kind hearted souls who took time out and commented on how it can be done and more importantly why it has to be done.

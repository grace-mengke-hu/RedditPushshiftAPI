Loss of appetite anyone?

Hey all! 
A bit about myself, I'm 25 and have been smoke free for 2 weeks after smoking for a good 7 or so years.

I was really looking forward to pigging out on delicious food after having my sense of smell and taste return to me but to my horror I can't seem to eat anything! My appetite has dramatically decreased.

Has anybody else had similar experiences or an explanation?

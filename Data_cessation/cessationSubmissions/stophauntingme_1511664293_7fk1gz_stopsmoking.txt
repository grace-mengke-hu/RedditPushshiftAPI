List of Thanksgiving firsts - still didn't smoke!

* Spent the week with my sister &amp; brother in law, both of whom I love (drinking &amp; smoking with). Still didn't smoke.

* Thanksgiving was the drunkest I've ever been since I quit - still didn't smoke. Edit: to add, even drunk as can be, my drunk ass still registers how awesome it is I don't have to go outside in the cold to have a cigarette to enjoy my drink anymore

* My sister &amp; bro-in-law went out for more cigs &amp; got an extra pack of my brand for me "just in case" and later (when she'd had a few more glasses) my sister said her husband got the extra pack because "::looks at me pointedly:: he knows our family." It made me laugh and crave a cigarette *so much.* Still didn't smoke! 

* On Thanksgiving, my mom relapsed (but just fyi, she doesn't believe she's addicted to cigs &amp; she'd already told me she was pretty sure she might have some cigs come Thanksgiving). Still didn't smoke. 

* Cigarettes still smell good to me, so I don't know what to do about that, but thinking about *smoking* a cigarette is slowly getting less appealing. Whenever I think about a substantial inhale of smoke like it's something I might want to feel again, instead I inhale clean air deeply through my nose and force myself to compare the sensations &amp; think about how that deep breath couldn't have been as easily achieved only a month ago. 

Thank you, /r/stopsmoking. I actually grabbed my tablet and read through some of the posts while hanging out with my family when they were smoking. It helped me a lot.

Ended my Thanksgiving trip with my whole family really supportive that I hadn't relapsed.

Two holidays and so many irregular triggers down, so many more to go! Tackling each one is like a step further up an imaginary health mountain...

I went to the bar and didn't smoke!

I feel like in so many ways I went full circle yesterday. I started smoking because my ex smoked. At first I was one of those, "only smokes while drinks" people and then we started drinking a lot. I lost the ex, but kept the habit. 

We met at the bar yesterday, which gave me a lot of anxiety since everyone says you should try to avoid places like this and I knew it was going to be **a lot** harder to avoid a cigarette. I stood outside with them while they smoked, there was even a moment where I almost asked if we could go smoke, but I didn't. I stayed strong, I worked through my cravings, I worked through the anxiety, and I'm so freaking happy that I did! I FEEL SO PROUD OF MYSELF!


I had to share with you all! Happy New Year!

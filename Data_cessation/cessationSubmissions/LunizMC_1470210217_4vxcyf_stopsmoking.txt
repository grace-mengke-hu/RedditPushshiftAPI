Acupuncture

Went for my appointment last night, where I had a chat and was then stuck with a few needles, before being sent on my way, with considerably less money than I'd started with.  I didn't feel any different last night, and I don't feel any different today.  I'm pretty miserable to be honest, and I feel like it was a complete waste of quite a lot of money.  Can't help thinking that I should have gone for hypnotherapy instead, but also can't escape the feeling that I could just as easily be sat here typing the same about that, and wishing it were the other way around.

I guess I just have to try and give up now, even though I don't feel like this treatment has helped me at all.  It just feels like cold turkey all over again.

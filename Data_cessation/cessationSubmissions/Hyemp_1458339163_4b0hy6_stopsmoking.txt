Thats what I smelled like??

Holy shit. I feel bad for everyone who ever had to smell me after I went out for a smoke. My colleague came in after a smoke yesterday and sat next to me and the smell was disgusting. I just kept thinking to myself, "holy shit, is that what I smelled like? Fuck that's so gross" SO GLAD I DON'T SMELL.

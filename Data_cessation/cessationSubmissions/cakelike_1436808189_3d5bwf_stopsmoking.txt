Am i addicted to smoking?

This might sounds stupid but here goes anyway. I have been smoking for the last 7 years. I don't smoke a lot, probably around a 20 pack every week. I don't feel like smoking first thing waking up in the morning, i normally have a habit of lighting up after a meal or after i have eaten something. I don't really get cravings and can go weeks without feeling like a need a smoke. If i run out of cigs it doesnt really bother me and i can wait days before being bothered to buy more. Am i addicted?

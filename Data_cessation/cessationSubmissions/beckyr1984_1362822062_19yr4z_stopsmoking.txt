Curious questions/looking for advice!

Well guys, long story short, I've been trying to quit smoking for awhile now (6 months or so) my longest streak being 1 month, with patches (which btw, I only needed less than a few days of the patches to feel like I was completely fine). The streak was broken, so I SAY by my boyfriend, who was "suppose" to be quitting with me, and once I found out he was smoking I DEMANDED a cigarette.

Fast forward to now, and I'm using the excuse that "well if you aren't going to be serious about it neither am I" or "patches were the only thing that worked and I can't afford them now" etc. 

I find myself making excuses constantly, and I'm not proud of myself for that. Especially since it's been causing issues with me and my boyfriend in our relationship. We've NEVER lied to each other before about anything before, but when it comes to our "attempts" at quitting, it's a damn joke, and we both know it now (after 4 months or so of trying)

Anyways, I've been lurking here for few months or so, and any help would be SO much appreciated. I've heard about the book, and a few other things as well, my main question is..were you all as stressed out as I am whilst trying to quit? 

I've learned that I use that as a main excuse 9 times out of 10, claiming that I will stop smoking when I'm in a better place in life. 

Anyways, thanks to all for helping =)

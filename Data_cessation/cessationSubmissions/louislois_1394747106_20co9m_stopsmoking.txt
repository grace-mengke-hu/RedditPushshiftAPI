Into week 3 and I feel amazing!

Well, I'm into the third week of my quit.  The first two were horrible where I was dealing with a serious case of the Quitters' Flu (sever cough, insomnia, and lack of appetite).  At the worst point, I lost my voice as the coughing had gotten so severe.

The coughing is finally abating now, and my throat isn't killing me.  I'm coughing less and less as the days progress.  To those in their first week of quitting, hang in there!  It sucks as soon as you start but it will gradually get better.

SCREW THESE DAMN CIGARETTES!!

I made the terrible decision to start smoking cigarettes. It was a slowly developed addiction and it's been like 3 years now. I am so disappointed in myself for smoking them. I tried my first attempt at quitting on the 21'st of december..I made it one day without. Then the next day I bummed one from a friend thinking I'd be alright and the time was perfect for a smoke...sure enough I ended up buying a pack after bumming a bunch like 10 days later...I hate the smell, the taste, the image, the yellowing teeth and dark eye circles...but I cannot cope with the irritability and depression I go through when trying to abstain...Any one have some actual, realllyy GOOD tips?

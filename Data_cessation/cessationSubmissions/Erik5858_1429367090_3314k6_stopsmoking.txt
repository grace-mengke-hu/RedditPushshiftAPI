90 Days Today!

3 Months wow. I never thought I'd get this far and i'm glad I did. I wake up without coughing anymore and I can go for a drive and drink coffee without craving that death stick. I'm able to drink alchohol and play on a dart team with smokers around me and it doesn't even bother me anymore. Its only getting easier for me and I will stay strong! Off to my daughters 7th birthday party ill check back later!

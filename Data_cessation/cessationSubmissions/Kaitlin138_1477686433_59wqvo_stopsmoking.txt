Day 5 and I'm making all my addictions my bitch!

So, as the title implies, today is day 5 of no smoking. Not even a puff of a vape. I've been smoking since I was 16. That's half my life. I've quit before but I'm determined to make this time my last time. I also struggle with over doing it with alcohol and food in moments of weakness and stress. And I'd say that quitting smoking would definitely qualify as a stressor. However, I haven't had a drink and I've been sticking to my 1200 calorie per day diet (been eating at a deficit since Dec 2015). So yeah I'm killing it and hoping that the rest of you are too!

Deciding whether or not to take the Chantix my doctor prescribed me

Hey all. I’ve been smoking since I was 13, now almost 23. Been a pack a day smoker for a few years now and have tried to quit a few times, the patch made me nauseous, the gum is disgusting, e-cigarettes didn’t help as I enjoy the taste of a cigarette and it didn’t give me the same feeling. My cousin and biological father are on chantix, my cousins been on it for a while and she successfully quit and my biological father is on week 2 of his second attempt to take it. The only things they complain of is the agitation. But after reading and doing more research as my doctor told me to do before taking it, all of these horrible experiences people have had are making me nervous to take it. 
Has anyone taken chantix to quit? And if so, what was your experience and would you recommend it?

It begins today.

Hello, my new quitting friends! Today is day 1 for me (as of literally a few minutes ago) and I'm going cold turkey. I've done this once before, and made it a week before I caved in and bought a pack while stressed out over school. I'm pretty resolved and confident this time around. The most stressful part of the school year has passed for me, and I'm gonna make it. Anyway, besides saying hello to all my new cheerleaders, the point of this post is to ask a few questions... 

1) Have you gained weight since you quit? I've been hitting the gym pretty hard recently and lost about 12 lbs in the last month (the goal is to lose another 20!). I'm terrified that quitting will reverse my weight loss. Is it true that quitting smoking - even with diet and exercise - can result in weight gain? What are your experiences?

2) Have you experienced your teeth getting whiter after having quit? I'm very regular about brushing, but my teeth have still gotten pretty yellow over the last 8 years of smoking. I'm concerned because one of my front teeth is mostly fake (hooray for falling off bikes!) and matches my currently yellowish smile. Being a fake tooth, I'll have to get it replaced if I want it to match a whiter smile. Maybe I'll just drink a lot more coffee? Not sure what's worse: yellow smokers teeth or an otherwise white smile with a mismatching yellow front tooth...

I know these are very superficial questions for an otherwise uphill psychological battle, but I feel I've seen the worst of it before, the last time I quit (for a week... but that's the worst part of it, right?). Starting to ramble, so I'll stop now. Any and all advice/encouragement welcome!

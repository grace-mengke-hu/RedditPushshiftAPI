I don't want to quit

It's my 4 day at this and I already know about the cravings and such that comes with quitting cold turkey. I've quit before and have gave up and this time I am giving up the smokes. Occasionally I will think to myself when ever I have strong cravings that I do not want to give up smoking and I'd rather smoke. I had nothing wrong with me smoking and it was a great way for me to pass time. Now I cannot seem to concentrate, I cannot stop for a min without thinking for cigarettes. sometimes I am just so tempted to go out and buy a pack of smokes that I just call people and complain about me wanting a cigarette. 

Wtf is wrong with my brain? why does it want to quit but want to smoke so badly ?
I know its the craving but I've never had this temptation to go buy smokes. 

I really don't want to give them up. I really don't.

four years, a retrospective of sorts.

Two days ago was four years:

Just want to check in, this is the group I credit for HUGE help in my staying quit. Thank you all, you are amazing!

My history is that I smoked for 26 years, starting when I was barely 13 and it defined me for a long time. The shortened version is that I decided one day that I was done.  

Last year I was not around here to post my three year post because I was hiking the Pacific Crest Trail, here is a video I made about how I ended up quitting smoking while I was hiking on the PCT. (I think I got the permissions right on this)

Warning: hiking video, and crazy guy who has been in the woods for months ;)

This year I am back in LA at a new job and planning my next big escape..

My one year post I had traveled to S.E. Asia and all over with the money I saved from not smoking, my two year post I had no car anymore and was biking 20 miles to work every day as an experiment. The video here is my belated three year post because I was busy hiking 2,650 miles and this is my four year post :)

Still no car and biking to work, still not smoking, still hike.

My main thing to say, have a plan to reward yourself for not smoking, use the money you would spend on travel, or something good (a new car) or anything, but you need to in inject a lot of positive new things into your life after a while.   That is the best advice I have for the long term.

Good luck to you all who are quitting, you got this.. you do! And of course congrats to you all who have stayed quit!

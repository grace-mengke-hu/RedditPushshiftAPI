Where there’s a will there’s a way.

At the beginning it seemed like a part of me was missing and I couldn’t accept it, it was like a part of me was chopped off. Now after  50 something days, I feel so fu#%*!@g cool! So proud of my willpower, we know how hard it is quitting. That’s my second time nicotine free. I used to see myself like a loser to relapse after a year and a half (years ago), now I have a total different vision: I’ve been twice a winner to be able to stop this mental slavery twice in my life.
Long story short guys, we’re all winners!

Good luck to everyone

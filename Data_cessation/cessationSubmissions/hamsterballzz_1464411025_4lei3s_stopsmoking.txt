Constructive advice?

Looking for a little advice on dealing with stress. Every time my stress levels peak I go back to smoking. I really want to stay quit but most of the advice I get is making it worse. Exercise and deep breathing are increasing my anxiety. Need sedentary non meditative coping mechanisms. I can't stay on the patch for life. Ideas?

I posted not long ago about having a smoke here and there at work after four years clean....guess what happened.

I started buying packs of smokes again, and though I never smoked anywhere outside of work, I was up to several cigarettes a day, and was even swinging by work on weekends to smoke with coworkers. 

Man, I REALLY love to smoke!

But all the usual problems start to arise. My breath stinks, my hands stink, I'm throwing money down the drain. Every morning when I wake up my throat hurts. My breathing on runs has been noticeably strained. And I've been getting headaches that I know are connected to smoking, because I recall getting the same type the last time I was smoking.

I managed a little over four years clean with the help of /r/stopsmoking last time. Hopefully I can do a bit better this time.

Thanks for your support.

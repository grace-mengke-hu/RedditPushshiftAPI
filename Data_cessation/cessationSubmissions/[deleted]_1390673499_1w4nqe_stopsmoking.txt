Day two smoke free!

I only smoked about four a day, but I loved my cigarettes so much. I'm quitting for ME and my health and I need all the support I can get right now. My husband has no idea how hard this is for me since he's never been addicted to anything. It's day two and I'm happy and determined, and totally in withdrawal.

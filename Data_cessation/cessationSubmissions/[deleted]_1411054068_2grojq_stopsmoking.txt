A list of things I have found helpful

I'm following the missions on my SmokeFree app and, for day 19, I'm supposed to write a list of the things I have found useful so far, so here it goes (maybe some of it will be useful for somebody else)  :)

1. Quitting NRT - This has made all the difference in the world and compared to my previous attempts when I was on the patch I feel so much more committed and the cravings are almost all gone now.
2. Reading this free e-book http://whyquit.com/ffn/ - I found it a lot more useful than Allen Carr's (less patronising, in my opinion). I read it in one sitting and I keep going back to bits of it almost every day!
3. Everything on whyquit.com
4. Posting and reading posts here regularly (!)
5. SmokeFree - an app that tracks my stats and gives me a different mission every day to help me stay committed.
6. My dog - walking him helped with all the cravings and he was the only creature that I didn't hate when going through withdrawal. 
7. Not avoiding any activity - so as not to feel like I'm giving up something substantial in my life.
8. My circle of close friends and family members that smoke like chimneys! - Since I've been getting my support from the subreddit, the book, the app and so on, being around smokers has made me happy to be putting that behind me. 
9. Reminding myself of my decision all the time, but trying not to discuss it with others to remind myself I'm doing it for me.
10. Exercising.

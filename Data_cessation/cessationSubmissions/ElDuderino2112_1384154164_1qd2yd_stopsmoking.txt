Quiting smoking soon. What do I absolutely need to know?

So, I've been a pretty heavy smoker (about a pack a day for the past 6 months, and before that half a pack a day for 5 years or so) for a long time now and I'm getting sick of it. It's getting really expensive and I'm starting to feel like shit all the time. I know it's going to be really difficult, so I've picked December 16th as my quit date because that's when I'll be done all my papers and exams for this semester and I'll be able to (hopefully) stand the withdrawal then. What about this do I absolutely have to know? What tips will help me? What methods should I avoid? Should I try the patches or not waste my money? Etc. Anything like this would help me immensely as I've pretty much not gone a day without a cigarette since I started smoking and never really considered quitting before. If it's any help, I'm turning 22 soon and I've been smoking since I was 16. Thanks in advance everyone, and here's hoping this sticks!

I'm an addict and I'm scared

I have been smoking a long time, 16+ years. My lungs heart my heart hurts my throat hurts. I've had unsatisfying relationships and I'm sure that's due to the damage I have caused to my heart chaukra and the way I smell. A few months ago I quit smoking for two months. Becuause of this I am sure I have the ability and lifestyle to be able to quit. I experienced so many beautiful things because I was a non smoker! I came back smoking twice as much as I used to. I feel like no other goals matter in my life until I overcome smoking. Why bother getting a better job as long as I smoke if I can't even do something a simple as quitting smoking? Why bother exercising if I can't do it as well as a non smoker could exercise? Why bother having a kid if I can't even have the self decipline to not light up? This community did so much to support me in ways I can not describe when I successfully quite smoking before, it's not easy I will take a long time being annoying. Day one, now

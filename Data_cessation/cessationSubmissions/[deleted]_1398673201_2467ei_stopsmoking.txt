Day 6...In retrospect, I really couldn't have picked a worse time to quit

I am finishing month 4 of an 8 week home renovation project...with no end in sight. 


I was living with my girlfriend who, one month ago, with no other warning and no notice, woke me up in the middle of the night and told me she wanted me to leave. That night.


So I left, and camped out in my construction zone. I had no bathroom so I had to plan my eating schedule carefully so I could be at work when...um, necessary. I also had no bed and no furniture other than a camping chair, which I am currently typing from.


My renovation has gone way over budget, which is stressing me out because I'm not sure where I'll get the money from to pay for it and I can't exactly stop now because my house isn't liveable.


I was taking Champix, but didn't like the side effects so stopped taking it last Thursday. Since then I have had cravings, weird emotional swings and a bit of paranoia last night.


Yesterday I went on a second date with a new girl who seems very nice.


I'm not certain, but I think my furnace may have just crapped out.


Still smoke free! :)

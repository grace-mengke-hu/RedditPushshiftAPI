Almost at 24 hours and the cravings are unreal

I have been a smoker for a large majority of the last 13 years of my life. I think I only didn't smoke for about 3 of them, and that was 4 years ago. I remember it being really easy to quit cold turkey then! I had just woken up one day and decided I was done. No cravings at all.

This time around it was more of a conscious decision to quit. It's just bad for me. And holy crap, the cravings! I only slept 6 hours because the cravings actually woke me up. I dreamt about smoking. I almost said "fuck it" and walked out to buy a pack while making breakfast, barely stopped myself. Never has any of that happened. Any suggestions on how to deal with this quickly?

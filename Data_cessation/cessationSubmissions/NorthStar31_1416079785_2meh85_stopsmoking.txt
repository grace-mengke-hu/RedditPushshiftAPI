It's Day One and I'm fucking ready!

I'm done. I've watched the Allen Carr video. 

I'm tired of being a slave. I'm tired of spending nearly my monthly rent on something that's killing me and making me feel terrible.

I'm tired of talking to girls at bars and needing to go outside and come back smelling gross and being insecure about it.

I'm tired of waking up feeling tired.

I'm free. I'm ready. Bring on the withdrawal, we're gonna kill 'the little monster'.

I'm heading to work now. I'm heading to a rock show afterward.

And I'm a nonsmoker.

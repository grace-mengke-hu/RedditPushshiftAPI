Need help, advice, encouragement...

I'm on the journey to end this horrible habit I've endured for the last 11 years. I've attempted to quit smoking multiple times but to no avail. Was closest about 3 years ago. Quit cigs all together for about 3 months, was using a vaporizer weaning off of nicotine. Then, I met my now boyfriend who smoked(he's quitting with me as well). Being around him and his smoking family all the time got me hooked on smoking again.  

3 years later, I'm ready to stop smoking. For good. Not only for my health and to rid of my financial burdens, but to set a healthy example for our son. I'm struggling guys! I'm trying to cut down considerably; preparing for my quit date on Dec 1st. I don't think I'm doing horribly, I bought a pack Sunday, lasted me until Wednesday. Bought another one. Only smoked a few. I was smoking about 1 1/2 packs a day. I'm substituting with my vaporizer as it helps kick the cravings(sometimes). 


I'm mostly fine at home. I can puff on my vaporizer instead of having a cigarette. What I'm mostly struggling with, is being a work. I work in a call center doing tech support. Takes a great amount of patience for this job. Esp when it comes to uneducated customers. It can get very frustrating. And I'm basically attached to my cubicle until break/lunch time. Which consists of two 10min breaks and a 1/2 hr lunch.  If a craving hits, I'm stuck, to ponder about it. I can't just get up and walk it off or use my vaporizer indoors. When I finally do go on break or lunch, I cave and have a cigarette. 

Give me some suggestions, words of advice anything as to what I can do to make things easier while at work.

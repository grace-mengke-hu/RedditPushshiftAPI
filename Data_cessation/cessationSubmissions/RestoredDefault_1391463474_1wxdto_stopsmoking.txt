Done with those damn things!

I have been a smoker for the last 8 years of my life.  I finally made the decision to be done with it for good.  I have been reading through this subreddit and have found a ton of encouragement from the success stories of others.  I am looking forward to a cleaner and brighter future free of those nasty little things :)

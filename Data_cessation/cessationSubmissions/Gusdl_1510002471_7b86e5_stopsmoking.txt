I just did it. I put out my last cigarette. Today is the start of my better future!

Hello guys,

you really motivated me, thanks for that so far!

I just put out my last cigarette. I‘m going to take my health in my own hands. No more coughing, no more driving to the shop at 11 PM just for satisifying that urge to smoke. No more smelly clothes and complaints of my girlfriend. 

Do you guys can give me tips?
Or maybe a „roadplan“ of what is ahead of me?

Thanks so much so far!!

Debilitating depression

I will be 2 weeks smoke free tomorrow. My boyfriend and I are doing this together. He quit cold turkey and he feels fine now. Me on the other hand! I used some patches and lozenges for the first week until I ran out (had some left from a previous attempt). I ran out of lozenges 4 days ago and have been experiencing terrible depression since then. I have been crying non stop, this feels like heartbreak or like somebody has died or something! I succumbed and bought some lozenges today which have helped slightly but I'm still an emotional wreck. I just desperately need some support. I feel so low and like life just will never be enjoyable again. 
Some context: female, 33, One young child. Out of work for 6 months and start a new job next month. Smoked 15 roll ups a day for about 15 years with one 3 year break in that time. 
Thanks for reading.

Taking control of my life back.

I've tried before and failed. This time is so much different. Since I've put them down, the idea of smoking makes my stomach turn. My reason for stopping this time is stronger than my addiction. Now when I get a craving, I just smile and think of how I never have to let a cigarrette decide where I sit in a restaurant or even wich restaurant I go to. I don't have to tell my child to be carefull around me, he can run and hug me when ever he wants, and I don't to be afraid he'll get a burn. I can work without thinking of when I can have my next cigarette.  
I'm taking back control over my life, starting with this addiction. and it feels GREAT!!

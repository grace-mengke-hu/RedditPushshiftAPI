10 days in...

I've been lurking for a while and finally, with some motivation from Smoke Free's missions, decided to post! I quit on 1-20, smoked a few on the 24th, and have been cigg free ever since then. The title says 10 days, but I guess if I am being completely honest it's really been 6 days since my last smoke. ;)

Regardless, I am damn proud of myself. Smoked for 15 years averaging 1/2 to 3/4 of a pack a day (or a pack a night if drinking!), and I have never even attempted to quit prior to now. I am using an e cig at the moment, but plan on reducing the nicotine levels accordingly as I go through the process. 

I take each day as it comes, and this sub has really helped me to get into that mind frame. I will not smoke today! Thank you all for your motivation!

Where to start?

Probably get this type of thing a lot here and I'll try to keep it short, but the story is my grandpa died today and honestly the main reason (among many) is probably that he smoked every day for the last 50 years. I don't ever want someone else to go what I and the rest of my family is going through because of this. I don't even know where to start though.

I went to a military school and the only time we got even 5 minutes to our selves was the smoking post, nobody could come and totally fuck your day up there. It was an escape. And that's what really got me started. And then when I graduated things went to shit, one job after another fell through I got a gig working part at a liquor store which is ok except for the fact that on an 8 hour shift breaks are non-existent unless it's for a smoke and I dunno just sitting on a bench for 5 minutes can mean a lot in tha environment. 

Basically I'm a straight up addictive personality who doesn't want anyone else to suffer because of me in the long or short term and I need strangers on the Internet to berate me until I feel bad enough to quit. Yup.

Anxiety about quitting

I have this weird thing where I donâ€™t get motivated to quit smoking unless I have a (mostly) new pack around. Then I curb (chain) smoking for a day or two and BINGE. Anyone had this? Also, I am coming down from about 1.5 to 2 packs a day to 0.75 to 1 pack a day with Chantix.

Side note, does Chantix dosage get upped?

Thanks and keep up the good work!

It's been about 6-7 months since I've stopped smoking..

And it couldn't have been a better choice. 

[This](https://imgur.com/a/WUnhb) is a relatively small amount of packs I've kept. I honestly thought I had triple this, but I think I just threw them away. I was saving these packs for the past couple years because I was eventually going to do an art project with them, never got around to it, so thought it would be interesting to share.

I started smoking when I was around 18, I'm 31 now. Never a pack a day person, I probably went through a pack or two per month. I was usually a social smoker, though it did become a habit in certain situations like on my drive to work for example. I was never physically addicted, but for a while I did feel like I needed it to socialize sometimes or for an image issue. I'm kind of a introverted nerd so at times when I was by myself in public, I thought the image of me smoking would make myself look cool and look like I was doing *something*. It was an easy way to meet people and socialize with strangers at bars and concerts.

As a result of this and other bad habits, my teeth are nowhere near as healthy as they should be. Earlier this year, I got a cracked, decayed tooth pulled. It would cause me extreme pain for periods at a time and it had to go. I knew smoking contributed to its decay and since then, I've stopped completely!

Is this the right place to ask for help?

I really apologize if this isn't the right place to ask this but I need some solid advice!
I smoked for 7 years and had quit cold turkey. It went fine for a couple years until a huge breakup happened and I fell onto my crutch.
Fast forward to today. I recently quit smoking again a couple months ago for medical reasons (I have a high risk of blood clots) but I desperately feel I need the cigarette.
I deal with a lot of traumas due to many rapes and other serious things, I have chronic depression and anxiety and a lot of stress. Cigarettes are incredibly soothing and help me feel better but I obviously quit for my health so that's what is stopping me from still smoking.
How do I keep myself from smoking?!
The urge isn't little cravingbursts that go away, it's constant 24/7. I've almost relapsed every day this week.
Also eating carrots, chewing gum, sucking lollipops etc never does a thing. Never worked for me at any point in life.

TLDR
Stopped smoking for medical reasons.
Constant craving to relapse due to serious trauma and emotional struggle.
How to not?

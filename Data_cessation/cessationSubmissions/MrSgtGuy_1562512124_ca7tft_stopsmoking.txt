Little Big Victory

Went on the annual summer camping trip with friends from work. It's been a year this time. TBH, was tempted a couple times. The kids were there and helped me keep my resolve. Feel good about myself not relapsing. May have even inspired a buddy to quit, we'll see.

Thanks to this sub and everyone who contributes.

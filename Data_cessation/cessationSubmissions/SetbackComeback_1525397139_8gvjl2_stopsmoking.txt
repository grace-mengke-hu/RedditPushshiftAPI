The Smell of Rain

Quick one here. For anyone living in the NYC area, you know that it's been very warm the last couple of days (90 degrees).

Today, the wind blew in, and a storm rolled through. It rained that hot, smelly, summer rain you remember from your childhood. It was dank, humid, and a little overwhelming.

So glad to have experienced it. For all new to the quit, keep fighting. For all thinking about quitting, it's about a collection of small things like smelling rain that make non-smoking more glorious than you realized it could be.

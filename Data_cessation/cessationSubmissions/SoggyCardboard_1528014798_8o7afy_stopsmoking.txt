Just putting it out there

Ive been smoking about a pack every 2/3 weeks for maybe 2 years. With weed initially and then sometimes by itself.. Anyhow I've been seeing myself spiral with it. I've tried to cut the tobacco out multiple times and I keep failing. Tonight I went to buy a pack on my lunch break, locked my keys in my car, had to wake my mom up to bring me a spare.. Fucking car auto lock/keyless key malfunction.. Hate that shit.. All for a pack of cigs. Totally not worth it. 

What the fuck am I doing. I'm wasting money, inconvenience others, making my parents worry, shortening my life, really REALLY increasing my risk of stroke thanks to some meds I'm on. All for what? So I can be less stressed for 5 minutes before I feel like shit for smoking?

I smoked half a cig almost two hours ago. Hopefully its my last. Its going to be wicked hard to not smoke for the next couple of days. I want to say I've got this but failing at it so much hasnt improved my belief in myself.

I'm so used to getting done work and smoking a bowl of green and tobaccoo(a mole) . Thats like my favorite thing in the world. Im going to smoke just green today. I'm going to fucking do it. And I'll do it while theres tobaccoo within arms reach. And I'm gonna say fuck that shit, mj used to be enough, and mj still is enough.

As I write that I'm very aware of how many times I've said "just one more mole" today feels different. I feel so fucking ashamed.

Hopefully I'll stay strong today and get over the hump... I downloaded some shitty app, maybe that will help

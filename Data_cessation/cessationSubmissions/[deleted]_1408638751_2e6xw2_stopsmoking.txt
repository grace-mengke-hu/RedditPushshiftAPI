My girlfriend just quit after I mentioned that it would be nice once. What can I do to help her?

(She told me this morning). She smoked between what I think is one and two packs a day, works in the food service industry, and most of her friends smoke. I only get to see her a few days a week because our schedules line up, but I want to make it easier for her whenever I can. Is there any advice on how I can do that? Thank you all in advance.

I don't smoke, if you're wondering.

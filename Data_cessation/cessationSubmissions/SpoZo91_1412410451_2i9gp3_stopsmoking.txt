This is it.

Today was a roller coaster. I walked out on a shit job, got another one, went to the bar to celebrate, and watched the girl I invited out leave with someone else. As I sit here, I realized that cigarettes aren't helping me de-stress, and they don't make the good times better. I've been using them as a crutch and as an augment to my good times, when really, they're holding me back as a person. 

I smoked my last one outside the bar. Tomorrow I'm hitting the gym for the first time in forever. It's gonna suck, but I'm going to push myself. This will be my new stress management system and a means of elevating already good moods. Goodbye tobacco, you've been nothing but a fucking anchor around my neck.

HI /r/stopsmoking

Hi fellow non smokers, I've just discovered this sub and think this really migh help. I have not smoked for three weeks now, and I am trying really hard to keep it that way. 

I'll probably will visti this sub many times a day since I am having a lot of cravings. 

Let's ride together.

So I've just met a girl who hates smoking

I really like her and I really hate smoking I've posted here before that I've tried chantix and patches. Chantix made me go insane with the insomnia and patches made me have terrible, terrible dreams. What have you done either with your schedule or every day routine that helped you quit.

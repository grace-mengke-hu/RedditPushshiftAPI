How hard does it get?

Hey all,

Bit of context, I smoked about 8/9 a day, maybe 20 a night when I was out drinking. It was always my plan to quit just not this soon. 

A couple of days ago I decided to test myself to see how far I could get until a needed another cigarette, and since then I haven't had one.

My question is, how hard does it get? I've found over the first couple of days that other than a small craving once, I haven't really had the urge to have any. Nor have I really had any side effects.

I just wanted to hear it from someone else's perspective. When did it start getting difficult for you? Is the first two days the easiest in comparison to the rest of the month? I'm concerned I might be being a bit complacent for what lies ahead.

Some thoughts after almost 800 days

It's been over 2 years since I last had a cigarette, and I feel amazing.

I just wanted to share a thought I had this morning concerning one of the worries I had in the first few weeks of quitting; the feeling of fear that I'll ALWAYS want to smoke and I'll have to live with this horrible feeling of something missing in my life. I remember imagining the future and thinking "how on earth am I supposed to do X if I don't have a cigarette, what about nights out?"

Some of you might know the feeling that I'm talking about, like there's a gaping hole in your life after quitting, and I'm just posting this to reassure you that the feeling absolutely doesn't last.  In fact, I *literally* cannot imagine me smoking now, not a single part of me even considers smoking to be a possibility.

Anyway, I feel great, things taste great, smell great, and are just generally great. If you're thinking about stopping, please do, push past the hard parts and you'll thank yourself 1000 times over

How long for irritability to stop?

Hello, I'm 16 days without nicotine and this last week has been hell. Not because I'm craving necessarily but because I've been extremely moody. I've been going to the gym, eating healthy, taking vitamins and supplements, meditating, and attempting to get a good night's sleep but the irritability is still there and it's getting to me. How long can I expect this to last?

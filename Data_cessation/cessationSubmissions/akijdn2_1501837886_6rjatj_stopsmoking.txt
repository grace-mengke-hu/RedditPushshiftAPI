Do the mental issues ever go away?

Been cold turkey for a week. Not a long time, but I notice focusing and thinking and the such is still difficult for me. I'm wondering if this is a longterm thing for the rest of your life that will affect me. Honestly if it is, I would rather die early than feel like a retard the rest of my life.

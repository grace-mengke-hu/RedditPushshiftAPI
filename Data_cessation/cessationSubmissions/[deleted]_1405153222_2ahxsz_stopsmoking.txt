Smoker wanting to quit. Need advice

Hey everyone. I have been smoking for a couple of years now and I want to quit but it is a lot harder than I imagined. I found this subreddit tonight and I knew I had to ask for advice after looking at some of the posts. I know my triggers and they are;

-waking up/going to bed

-after eating

-walking from place to place (college campus)

-stress

I have a very addictive personality and quitting in the past has been super hard for me to do. My girlfriend hates it and she just moved to Florida and i want to surprise her with me having quit when i go to visit her. That is not my only reason, I want to do it for me. If you have any tips, I would really appreciate it. 

tl;dr I want to quit. It is hard. Any advice?

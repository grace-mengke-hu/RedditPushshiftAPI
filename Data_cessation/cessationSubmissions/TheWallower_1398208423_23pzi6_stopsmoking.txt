Stopped 14 days ago...Help

I stopped smoking 14 days ago, i never really got the "3-day hump" that many people say you get when you stop. 

However now after I have got so far without any assistance (nicotine patches etc) i feel like i really want a cigarette!

Should i start on some nicotine replacement or shall i just try to carry on without?

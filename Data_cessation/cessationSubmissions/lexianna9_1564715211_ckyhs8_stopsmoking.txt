7 Days Tomorrow!

This is another attempt to quit smoking! I began smoking very young &amp; at The young age of 15 I was a regular smoker! I’ve smoked 1 + packs a day for 29years! I’ve tried to quit more times then I can count! I really want this time to be the last time! The first couple months seem to be extremely hard with cravings. Seems like senseless punishment to yourself to quit and then give in. You now have to start all over with the horrible cravings and withdrawals! The longest I have quit is four months. I am really trying hard this time to make it forever!

FINALLY MY NEW LIFE COMING UP

I stoped smoking 5 days ago and things are going better today. The third day felt like living hell with acing in my body, cold sweating and anxiety. I have also had sleeping problems every night since this started but today was the first day I actually was able to somewhat focus at work. Iâ€™m still getting stress related feelings but the other day it went on and on the whole day. 

High five! Quitting is the best decision ever and I wish that I had done this earlier!

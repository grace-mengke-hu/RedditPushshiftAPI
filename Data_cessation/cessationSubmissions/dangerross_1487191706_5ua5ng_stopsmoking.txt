9 Months!!!!

Just stopping by and saying how stoked I am on going 9 months today!!! Never ever thought I'd be able to do it, and yet here I am. Thanks to this sub for being a... breath of fresh air ;)

Never give up - never surrender! One thing that really helped me was not looking for any praise from anyone by myself and from r/stopsmoking - no one should be more proud of you than you. Only you know how tough your own addiction is and it is up to us to defeat it. 

Who will join me in not smoking today??

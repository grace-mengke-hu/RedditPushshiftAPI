1 month ruined ?

I've been smoke free for a month but a birthday party arose and I talked myself into smoking a cigar. Before I was going through some pretty bad withdrawals but they all pretty much subsided like 2 weeks ago. I smoked not even a little bit of the cigar, but is this gonna put me through all those withdrawal symptoms again I really don't want that ?

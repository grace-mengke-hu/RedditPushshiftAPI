Describe the smell

Went to a bar last night. God smokers smell rancid... I just didn't realize it was that bad.

Here's the game, next time you're standing next to a heavy smoker  try to describe in words how they smell. I'm not sure I can do it right now, but will try to post when standing next to someone. Look forward to reading everyone else's descriptions.

On a side note - the girls normally not interested in me suddenly were when they found out I don't smoke.

Point of the post - if you're single, lonely, etc.... this is one huge motivation to ditch the cigarettes. You just don't realize how bad you smell until you stop, and how may women are simply not going near you because of that one reason.

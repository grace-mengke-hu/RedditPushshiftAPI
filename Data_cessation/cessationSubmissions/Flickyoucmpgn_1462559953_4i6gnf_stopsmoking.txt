Hey Reddit, help us say FLICK YOU to cigarette litter and the flicking habit that causes it!

When smokers flick their cigarettes, they flick off the world. To help them realize the damage they're causing, we're saying FLICK YOU to the litter and the flicking habit that causes it.

We're declaring today Anti-cigarette Litter Day and we could use your help!

Help us make a FLICK YOU heard around the world. Help us gain traction by liking us @flickyoucampaign on Facebook and Instagram, and @flickyoucmpgn on Twitter.

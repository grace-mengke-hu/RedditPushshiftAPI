Chapter 2

Hi everyone.  New here, Day 1!  A little background:  

- I quit drinking approximately 9 months ago after being a daily drinker for the last 13 years (and almost nightly blackout drinker for the year previous to quitting).  When I quit drinking, I knew it was for good and forever, not just for today.  I believe this down to the core of my being. 

- When I quit driniking, I started a daily exercise program as well as eating healthy and lost 50 pounds in 6 months.  

- I've cut down processed sugars and carbs down to almost nil.  

- I quit drinking caffeine about a month ago after realizing how much coffee I was actually consuming after I quit drinking.  I didn't know if that would make much difference in my general health besides curbing my addictive tendencies, but it really has improved any lingering gastrointestinal issues I had leftover from drinking.  

So now.  This.  The thorn in my foot that I've had longer than any of those others (well, except bread (processed carbs).  Loved bread my whole life!).  My first attempt was 3 weeks ago and I made it 4 days until my SO and I had an argument.  Off to the store I went after I couldn't stop obsessing about NEEDING it even after trying to derail my obsessive thinking.  The thing is, I really believed that I was ready to quit when I put down that last one.  I felt like I was on board 100%.  

I've started reading [The Power of Habit](http://www.amazon.com/dp/081298160X) last week to further understand the whole dynamics of how habits work and how to change them.  I mean, I have a base understanding and intuition about it, but I wanted more knowledge to build up my chances of quitting.  It basically discusses through examples of how the habit loop works; from cue, to routine, to reward.  It then discusses how to interrupt or change the habit loop, which is something that I already knew but it was interesting to see it put into action in the stories.  

What it mentions after that is what really perked my ears up and the reason why I am here joining this community. It contends that even after someone has the base habit under control, it can still be derailed during times of stress.  Their contention is the key is the power of beliefâ€”and the importance of social groups in helping create this belief.  For a habit to stay changed, people must believe change is possible. And most often, that belief only emerges with the help of a group.

If you want to change a habit, you must find an alternative routine, and your odds of success go up dramatically when you commit to changing as part of a group. Belief is essential, and it grows out of a communal experience, even if that community is only as large as two people.

When I quit drinking, I joined up at /r/stopdrinking and am a regular, daily poster there. And guess what?  I'm still sober and I'm lovin' life.  I've changed my life in more ways in the last 9 months than I have my entire adult life, and I don't just mean with the things I have "quit", but with the ways I have grown as a human being.  So if it works there, it can work here too, right?

I am here asking for this community's support and help to quit smoking.  Today, I am wearing a patch and chewing gum any time I get an urge to disrupt the habit loop and establish a different routine.  Any guidance that you guys have past that would be awesome.

Thank you!

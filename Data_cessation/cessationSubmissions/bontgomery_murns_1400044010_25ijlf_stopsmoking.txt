Getting ill after quitting

I have been a smoker on and off for 14 years (more on than off). The few times I have actually quit meaning no drags off friends cigarettes, no bumming one here or there no nicotine at all, just cold turkey, and every time I have gotten ill. Last time I quit I got a rather nasty lung infection that required antibiotics, which I like to avoid unless I really need them. I wonder if anyone has any good advice on how to boost yr immune system prior to quitting, or is it just something that I will have to belly up to?

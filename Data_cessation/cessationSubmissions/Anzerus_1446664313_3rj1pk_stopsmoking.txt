How badly I have damaged my lungs?

Hello there fellow quitters,

I'd like to ask if anybody have an idea how much I have damaged my lungs? I used to smoke for like 5-6 years for about pack a day. It started to feel very bad in my lungs so I decided to move on e-cig. Now I've been almost 9 months without real cigarette. Lost some weight (Still big guy) and my breathing has greatly improved e.g. can exercise just fine, walk long distances, also run a little. (Always been bad at it) and the breathing gets only slightly heavier on 4 story stairway.


So is there still hope for me? Everything was going pretty well until I couple days ago developed flu-like symptoms, little difficulties with breathing and feeling like there's clump in my throat. And yeah, I'm going to see doc probably tomorrow.


EDIT: Thank you for your answers! Much appreciated.

It's been 42 hours since I've smoked

I pretty regularly go 3 or 4 days cold turkey without smoking during the week without any real withdrawal issues. Last night was brutal, though. I just could not fall asleep, I maybe got 4 hours of sleep total. It's sort of a reminder for me that if I can go quit cold turkey for 3,4,5 days regularly, why not just fucking quit altogether?

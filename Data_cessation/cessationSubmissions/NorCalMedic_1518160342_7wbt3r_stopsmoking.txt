I have been lurking for sometime but here I am 4 days not smoking

I met the most amazing human about 10 months ago and I can’t picture a day without her so I quit. I have been coughing a lot at times to the point of throwing up, but I feel like any second I can gain is worth it. It’s a pretty shitty task but the benefits outweigh the cons. So here I am.

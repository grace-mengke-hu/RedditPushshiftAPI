Had a funny moment while reading Allen Carr easy way...

I got to the chapter on the benefits of smoking and saw it was blank. I thought there must of been a error in printing in my book so I went back to the book store and went through all five copies on the shelf with them all blank lol I don't know why I thought there had to be benefits to smoking but yea I thought it was pretty funny.

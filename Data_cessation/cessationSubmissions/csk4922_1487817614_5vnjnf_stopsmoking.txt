Day 10

Today is day 10. I smoked fairly regularly, 8-10/day, but not openly from age 21 to 37. I am trying hypnosis and went to my first session 2 weeks ago today.  That was a Wednesday and I ended up quitting on Sunday. I am really struggling the last couple of days but have my 2nd appt tomorrow evening and hope it gets easier. I'm about halfway through Carr's book. Is there a point when it just clicks? I am just struggling in the evenings this week wanting to just have one cigarette. I love that my car and clothes don't stink- it is extremely freeing. I so badly want to quit, but why is this so dang hard?!

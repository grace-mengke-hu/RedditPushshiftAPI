It really does get easier.

I just wanted you guys who are in the early days to know that.  
At first it was minutes between cravings. Then it was hours, then days, until now where I'm going a week without an attack of the nicotine-fiend.  
And I barely feel like a "quitter" anymore, I'm just a "non-" :)  
Stay strong, you got this!

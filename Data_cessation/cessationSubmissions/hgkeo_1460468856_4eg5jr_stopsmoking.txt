I feel like I have the "quitter's flu" after stopping for 12 days. Anybody else got this?

Is there even such a thing? I quit 12 days ago, except for a minor relapse 2 days ago (hence the flair). I was feeling great and healthy up until 2 days ago. 

I have a headache, nausea, confusion, and a weird painful sensation in my sinus, and a clogged nose. I'm starting to feel a sore throat, and some coughing too. All in all, very flu like, but not quite.

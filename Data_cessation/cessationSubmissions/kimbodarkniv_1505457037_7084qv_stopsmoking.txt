No smokes for 45 days

Even though I went cold turkey, it was sill a process to get to that point.

What I've found is that I thought I NEEDED to smoke whenever I can because I might not get a chance later and also when I want to kill 10 or so minutes. Thinking ahead of a non smoker me I couldn't imagine myself NOT smoking whenever I used to.

What I started doing is telling myself that smoking is in fact a waste of time and money. I also reminded myself how I feel right after that smoke(shit and feel like smoking again). Yes, took me a while to realise this well known fact. It just doesn't have any benefits. Cannabis has benefits and I'm not talking about new found medical benefits, I'm talking about the pure relaxation feeling you get from it instead of just higher blood pressure from cigarettes.

Anyway, don't swop one bad habit for another Looking at you, vapers!

After repeating to myself for more than a year that I'm wasting my life by smoking, I had a cigarette in my mouth and lighter in my hand. Thought for a second how I would feel after the cigarette and just dropped it. Haven't smoked since.

It's a huge process and good luck to everyone. Hope someone will find this helpful and help them quit as well.

Smoking is pointless (but still smells fucking good haha).

PS. Dont be scared to do things people tell you not to. Example: Don't stand close to smokers. Sure the smell is good but not doing so puts a subconscious fear in your mind that if you do you'll start again.

Fear of smoking again makes you think of smoking all the time. Get the fear out.

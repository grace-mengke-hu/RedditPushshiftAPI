Almost broke my streak

I gave in to stress and ran out to the store to buy a pack. I put the cigarette in my mouth. As the cigarette rested between my lips, I thought about how miserable things were before. Coughing fits, stale tobacco smelling hands/clothes, pale face, low energy, antsy, shortness of breath. Not to mention how others looked down upon me. I threw out the cigarettes including the lighter I bought. I can proudly say I am still a non-smoker. 11 days going strong 💪🏼. I can do this.

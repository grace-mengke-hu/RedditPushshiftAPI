Going to start day 3 - here are my thoughts

Most of the time it's VERY easy, but then I hit times where I crave a cigarette a LOT, mostly after I get in the car, sit down in front of the computer, or finish eating. There are others, but not a super huge amount at all, mostly just random stuff I notice.

When these hit I can't do anything since I gave away all my cigarettes. Even if I had them WITH me, I keep remembering that I'll forget I want one a few minutes later.

Right at this very moment while I'm writing this, and for the last 2 or 3 hours I haven't had a single craving. It's easy most of the time, folks! It's just those little bits you gotta watch out for, the rest is a walk in the park!

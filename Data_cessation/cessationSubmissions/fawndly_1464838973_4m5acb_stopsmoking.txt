I decided to quit today. I'm currently on hour 12.

I've smoked since I was 16, and I'm 24 now. I grew up around parents who smoked constantly (my mother smoked through all her pregnancies) and all my relatives were smokers. It was just normal. As soon as I tried them immediately hooked and I haven't stopped since. I was able to quit for a few months in 2010 using patches, but relapsed due to school-related stress.

Anyway, I've had a nasty sinus infection for three days after a weekend of partying and chain-smoking. I decided to be smart this time and actually take a break from smoking in order to heal. Today I woke up, had a cigarette, and was disgusted by the taste and feeling. I put it out halfway through and made a firm decision to stop making myself feel miserable, and to make a change that very moment. I then impulsively drove to the store and dropped $44 on nicotine patches.

Like the title says, I'm on hour 12 and am doing pretty well so far. Thanks for existing, r/stopsmoking.

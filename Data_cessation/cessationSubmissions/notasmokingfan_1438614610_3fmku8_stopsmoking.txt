Joined for the support!

Hi all, I was directed here by one of the 'missions' from the app 'Smoke Free' as an example support community.

I gave up at 14:55 BST last Wednesday and feel like I'm over the absolute worst part.

I managed to quit a few years ago and lasted over 3 months until I missed the last train home and was stuck with a colleague who smoked waiting until the next morning's first train (5 hours). Anyway, after 3 weeks I noticed I barely thought about smoking so that's what I'm looking forward to! Good luck everyone!

p.s. I went with the cold turkey route. That's the only thing that worked for me last time.

One week and a lot of battles won.

Well today makes one week without a cigarette.  From the moment I started the endeavor, I know that it was going to be a hard fight, but I also know that I would win it.  

I decided to plan for the times went being surrounded by cigarettes were inevitable.  Setting in a car with three smokers is one of this hard battle, but through the use of breathing, relaxation, and meditation these moments were no match.  These actions were very important in the first three days.  

I told everyone with pride that I quit for day one.  This included myself.  I respected those words numerous time throughout the day, and I still do so. 

I am starting to feel so much better physically and mentally.  I have better sleeping and eating patterns, more energy, and a better mood.

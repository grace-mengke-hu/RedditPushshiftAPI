Quitting the second time doesn't feel the same

So I quit smoking about 2.5 years ago the stayed up again a month ago. Then quit Christmas day. After the first time I was happy I quit and excited about it but this time I'm just resentful and bitter I don't want to not smoke and is beyond the mental addiction I just actually don't care.  This time around stuffs a lot more stressful (jobs, deaths, injury,ect.) But I don't think that's why I don't care any more.  I don't know what I'm asking or even trying to say I just felt like I needed an outlet so I can manage not to smoke today at the very least.

A quick note: be careful about drinking until' you black out, because you might smoke and not remember :/

I'm not saying that it happened to me, but it very well could have... I just haven't asked anyone who was around me, because I honestly don't want to know. As far as my sober mind is concerned, I haven't smoked a single cigarette since I quit.

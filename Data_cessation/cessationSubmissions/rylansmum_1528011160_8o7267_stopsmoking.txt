Today has been a HARD day..

So at 7.30am this morning I was officially a week smoke free, I was so excited to meet this milestone! But this has by far been the hardest day of those 7 days. My partner and I have been arguing, I have been restless, trying to study for an upcoming exam but I just canâ€™t concentrate...  what is going on?! Why has today been harder than any other day? Advice and words of wisdom are most welcome!

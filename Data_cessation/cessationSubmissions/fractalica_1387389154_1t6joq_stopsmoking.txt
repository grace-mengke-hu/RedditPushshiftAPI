I've finally decided to stop, but need encouragement! (Just sharing my story)

Hello everyone!
I've finally decided to stop smoking. There were 2 things that triggered this: one, I'm starting to feel like I can't breath at night. I'm a very anxious person, and I know that it's not only cig realted but also anxiety related, but it will still make me feel better. Two, I had a friend recently diagnosed with a thrombosis. She had an injury and had to be in complete rest for about a month, and that + her birthcontrol probably caused it. When she was telling me her story, she said "Luckily I stopped smoking, or it could have been worse".

The dangers of smoking for me were, in my mind, always for the long term. I could only think about lung cancer or something like that. But seeing my friend, 25 years old, with a thrombosis, well.. it gave me a different perspective on the dangers. Besides, between quitting smokes and my birthcontrol, I definitely preffer to quit smoking :)

But it's been so hard taking this decition because I really, really love smoking. I don't smoke *that* much, a pack usually lasts 2 days, but still. Tomorrow I'm going out and it's going to be my first challenge because I can't drink without having a smoke. I want to allow myself to 2 cigs max per day to start. To see how it goes :)

It's going to be hard, I've been smoking for 8 years and feel like it's a part of me. But I'm motivated and want to do it! I know it'll be for the better.

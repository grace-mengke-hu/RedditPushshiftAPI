Hmmm, am I doing this wrong?

I'll be quitting again Monday and figure this will be a great resource but this is my first time on Reddit so I'm a little confused (doesn't take much!). I thought I posted but can't find it so maybe I didn't. If this reaches anyone could you let me know please. Thanks!

Day 10 - Broke the plateau!

Those of you who have months or years under your belt might not think it much, I know, but it's a big deal for me. 



I came back from a week-long camping trip with a sore throat, no voice and no money because I smoked so many cigarettes. There were times when it wasn't even pleasant, anymore -- my lungs were so sore that every drag hurt, but the monkey on my back was making the decisions for me, so I smoked them anyway. 



I took the greyhound home from the trip, and when my foot hit the sidewalk in Philly, I gave the remains of my pack to a kid who'd been on the bus since SanFran, and I vowed to make it stick, this time. 


Since I got back home from that trip I've been borrowing a tool from the kit of a friend who's getting sober, and one I've seen used here: counting days. 


I've had a few slips since then, so my chains of good days broke down to four days, nine days, three days, one day, four days ... I couldn't seem to get back to that nine-day mark. 


Well, today I broke the plateau. It's been ten days since I smoked a cigarette. Wish me ~~luck~~ strength and steadfastness enough to keep it rolling.

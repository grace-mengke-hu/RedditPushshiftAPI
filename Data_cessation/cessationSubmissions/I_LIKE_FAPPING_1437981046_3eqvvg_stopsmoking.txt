Quitting again..

I am an addict - weed and cigarettes. I had my last joint a week ago and my last cigarette few hours ago. I saw a video here -http://www.quitsmoking.com/videos, today and realized that there is still hope for me. I am 26 and married to a lovely girl(who thinks I have stopped smoking :( )- I want to be healthy again and do not want to lie about my habits from the people I love.

Wish me luck!

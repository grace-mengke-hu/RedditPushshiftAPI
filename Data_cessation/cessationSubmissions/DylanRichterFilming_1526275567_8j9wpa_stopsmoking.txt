Just smoked a cig from the trash.

I'm angry with myself. I made a post here about quitting smoking quite some time ago. The thing about it is: I didn't. I recently got fed up and decided to quit again and throw my cigs away in someone else's garbage on a walk I was having.

At midnight I crept out of my house and walked a whole block away to grab my old pack. I had one and just felt disgusted with myself. I just want to quit already. I know I still have time. I've only been smoking for about six months and I want to stop now and get my health back on track.

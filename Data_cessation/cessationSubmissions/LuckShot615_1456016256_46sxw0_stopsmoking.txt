4 Days Strong

Been 4 Days since I made the life changing decision to quit smoking. Picking up the habit around 18-19 years of age I never dreamt it would go this far. Always been the child who worried about his parents smoking an hid their cigarettes all the time. Anyways, until recently  (9 years later) I found myself easily smoking a pack a day. I've tried to put them down more times than I can remember but something about this quit seems like it will go all the way. Been using nicotine lozenges the first couple days because I'd always went complete cold turkey the other attempts an failed. So far so good an I feel I deserve to pat myself on the back. 

Found this site an support group through an app on my smart phone. Hopefully you guys here have some good advice an positive notes to keep in mind. My struggle has only begun an I'm sure there will be plenty of severe cravings wanting to pull me back down.

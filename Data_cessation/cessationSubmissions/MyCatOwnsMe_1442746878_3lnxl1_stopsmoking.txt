Looking for some support in quitting vaping.

Hey everyone.
I quit cigarette smoking a year and a bit ago by changing to vaping.
I want to quit vaping now too.
I haven't used it today at all but it's super hard, particularly the fidgeting and needing to chew stuff to replace the vape.
Has anyone out there has any luck quitting vaping? If so, do you have any tips? 
Would love some ideas :) 

EDIT: four days down and I'm still hanging in there! Cravings were complete RUBBISH today but I'm still vape-free!

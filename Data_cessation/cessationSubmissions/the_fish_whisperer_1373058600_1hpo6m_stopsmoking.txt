it's like taking baby steps on roller skates sometimes.

On the first Friday of every month, we have a gathering at work, which involves light snacks, awards for performance and drinking.
I had been dreading this, as alcohol has always been my Achilles heel with regards to smoking. I was planning to abstain completely, but the philosophy is to continue to enjoy your life even more without the burden of nicotine addiction. In this spirit, I decided to have a beer. I ended up having a really good time with my sales manager and my operations manager, who are both non smokers. We laughed and talked about many things in a fashion that could only have happened in a social setting, lubricated with alcohol. I didn't suffer even the slightest twinge of craving. If anything, I enjoyed myself more than I would have with cigarettes as we were sitting inside, in comfort, instead of outside in the rain. (and of course, I wasn't suffocating myself) The experience of having a few drinks and a lovely social gathering, without nicotine or the craving for nicotine has added another layer of cement to my resolve to never smoke another cigarette.

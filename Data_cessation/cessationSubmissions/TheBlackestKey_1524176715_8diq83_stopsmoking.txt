How long does coughing last?

So I've been coughing more since quitting, which is normal. But just how long does it last? I was coughing normally after quitting for the first month or so, but recently I've developed a really nasty dry cough, anyone else experience this and how long did it last. I guess I'll add that my quitting app says coughing lasts 1-9 months so I guess I shouldn't be to worried. But how was/is your guy's coughing post quitting?

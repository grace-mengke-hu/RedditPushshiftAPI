Stiff neck?!

I "quit" smoking (regularly) a week or so ago. I did allow myself to have a few with some drinks this past weekend because I am also planning on cutting weekend alcohol. 

Anyway - almost from the moment I have quit smoking regularly I have had the worst stiff neck which feels more from sleeping than anything but I have never experienced this so much. Every day I wake up with pain and stiffness in a different area of my neck. It was brought to my attention that there could be a relationship between not smoking and this newfound regular pain. I feel comfortable with not smoking (moreso than I'd ever imagined I would) but maybe since I'm not using this "stress reliever" I am holding more tension in my neck?

I got on my roommates massage table last night and he did some work on me but it helped until I just woke up in the same terrible pain as every other day in the last week. 

Has anyone experienced this with quitting or do you think it's just a coincidence?

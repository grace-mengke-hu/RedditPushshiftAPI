Experiencing a lot of anxiety, panic attacks and depression...how to cope.

It's been over 40 days since I quit smoking. I didn't know exactly what a panic attack was until 2 days after quitting when I suffered a several hour long panic attack.  In the 40-some days since then I have had two more panic attacks each lasting about 3-4 days. 

Right now I'm mostly fine, but I'm feeling rather depressed- at least that's the best I know how to describe it.  I'm very anxious about the future now- worrying about a lot of stuff that is mostly out of my control. I have close friends, a sweet dog and loving girlfriend of 6 years, but I just feel like there's something missing from my emotions lately, like I should be feeling something more. Our sex life has been lackluster in recent weeks. I do not feel motivated to do anything. I force myself to go running and take the dog on long walks just to get some exercise and . I force feed myself food that I'm not really hungry for. I force myself to hang out with friends even though I kind of just feel like staying home. At work I can't focus on anything. I don't know what's going on. The only thing that has changed in the last month+ is I quit cigarettes.

I found [this article](http://asp.cumc.columbia.edu/psych/asktheexperts/ask_the_experts_inquiry.asp?SI=256) which was reassuring that this is probably a temporary thing resulting from nicotine/tobacco withdraw, but it doesn't really help me cope with it. Any advice on dealing with this kind of anxiety/depression? I'm already trying my best to exercise, get sun, eat right and maintain as much of a normal sleep schedule as possible. It isn't working for me though.

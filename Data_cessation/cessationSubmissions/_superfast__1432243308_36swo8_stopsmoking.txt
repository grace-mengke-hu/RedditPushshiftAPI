My number of days smoke free just hit double digits! 10 days!

I have been using the "smoke free" app to keep track of my quit and it's been quite helpful. I just hit 10 days smoke free and also 100 cigs not smoked. 

It's crazy to think about it in terms of how many cigs not smoked. I imagine 5 packs of cigarettes emptied onto a table, a pile of 100 cigs... That's so many... And to think I smoked for over 20 years. That's probably over 75,000 cigarettes... So crazy that I willingly did that to myself. So glad I finally cancelled that shit

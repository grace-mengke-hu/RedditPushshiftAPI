70-80 hour mark

let me know if this sounds normal for a 8 year smoker.
day 1: couple of cravings nothing serious
day 2: still going strong feel a little weird
day 3: light headed, like a fog over my brain or something. Can't form sentences without really thinking what i want to say. Typing for some reason is working fine. Just getting words from my head to my mouth has been hard
day 4: similar to day 3 just less intense. A lot more cravings like right now. i literally feel my finger tips freaking out about not having the numbing feeling in them, that plus a little pain from newly regrown nerve endings. any suggestions/is this a normal timeline?

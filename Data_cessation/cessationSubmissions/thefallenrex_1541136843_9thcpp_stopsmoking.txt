Round 2, forgot how much this sucks!

Quit for a year and a half a few years back, fell back off the wagon for a year.... 2 weeks no nicotine, finally starting to feel like a person again!!  In hindsight it was way easier to quit this time around, the real question is will I be able to stay off em for good this time...

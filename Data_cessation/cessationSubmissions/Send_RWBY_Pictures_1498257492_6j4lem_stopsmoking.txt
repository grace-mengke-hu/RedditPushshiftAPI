After 3 months, I relapsed

I've been trying to quit smoking for roughly 6 months now. I've failed 4 times. I see this as a bittersweet moment. Each time I've quit, I've been able to go longer periods of time. When I initially tried to quit, I wasn't able to go more than a few days. Each relapse has been a longer time than before. It started as a few days, then it was a week, then a couple weeks. Finally I got to the 3 month mark without having a cigarette before relapse. It's been hard, but each time I've made it further and further without having to rely on cigarettes. While I still can't fully control my urges to smoke, it's great to see myself slowly be less controlled by that urge. Although I still have problems, it's great to see that cigarettes control me less and less each time. It's been a hard time, but each time is getting easier. I'm never happy that I relapse, but I am proud that I've been able to go longer each time. I still have a long way to go, but thankfully it gets better the harder I try to quit.

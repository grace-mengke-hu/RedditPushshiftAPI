Think twice before you shrug off a pregnant smoker

I’m 325 days past my last cigarette. That was 127 days before I found out I was pregnant. I remember looking back and realizing gaining a few pounds, not secretly smoking, feeling shame hang over me, had made me a better person.

It was so freeing and beautiful that my body wouldn’t be sharing any cigarette-related substances with this new life. Not even a day. Many, many health care workers had to ask that dreaded question:

“No, not anymore. I quit in July.”
“Good for you!”

Yes, good for me. Good for me being smoke free for 4 months. Good for my anxiety to not worry about extra complications.

A girl from high school (eons ago) gave birth this year. A friend told me she had smoked her entire pregnancy. Her baby is fine, came early but she’s fine. But it’s not fine because this is not about horror stories. It’s about giving this newborn creature a chance at life that is optimal. It’s about at least trying to give up a vice to someone you are responsible for.

Obviously, we can’t run around shaming pregnant smokers. If you’re anything like me, resistance made me smoke even more. But why take the risk pregnant women? You feel so much better when you can say that you did everything you could for the life inside you.

We know better now. Pregnancy and habits are difficult topics but if mom is healthier and baby is better off, it’s not worth it. Feeling like you’ve taken agency over your pregnancy is. Your kid needs you in the womb to grow. They also need you to be there at their high school graduation. 

Just my thoughts for today after I saw a pregnant woman smoking in a parking lot.

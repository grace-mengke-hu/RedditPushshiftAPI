I need to Quit Smoking

Yesterday I smoked myself sick for about the third time. I know as I am doing it that I a having too many smokes, but after drinking and smoking weed i just didn't seem to care at that time. I have decided I need to quit smoking. I am a radio broadcaster and I know i need my voice so smoking is a bad decision. I am not really a cold turkey guy because I cave in to cravings easily. Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks

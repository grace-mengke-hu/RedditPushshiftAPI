Almost a year

I can't remember the exact day but sometime in the first week of August will be my 1 year anniversary of the end of my 2 pack a day habit..


But.. im addicted to nicotine gum and still chew 15-20 pieces of 6 mg nicotine gum a day. Has anyone else kicked the smokes and found it hard to get off the gum or lozenges?

What can I do to help my boyfriend stop smoking?

Hi everyone, 

My boyfriend has converted from a situational smoker to a regular smoker and i hate it so much. I've gotten so frustrated that I would yell at him and demand that he throw the cigarette away. I would roll my eyes everytime he bought a new pack. Also, he would smoke in the bathroom in the morning and I hated that because I believe smoking inside is disgusting. I would forcefully tell him to smoke outside even when it was cold. 

However, I'm seeing that I am wrong in this approach because I can see that I have hurt him by being so blunt with my distaste for smoking. He told me that he wants to stop, he really does, but he continues to buy the cigarettes. I have such a strong opinion on it because everyone in my family smoked my whole life and have had preventable sicknesses due to it. I just don't see the purpose of picking up the habit in this day and age when there is clearly no benefits. I don't want to hurt his feelings anymore though. He brushes his teeth afterwards, but the smoking in the house is too much. Also, I cannot see a future with a chain smoker. I don't want to raise a family with a smoker. It sounds rude, but it's how I feel. I have told people in my family that it's best for them to stop smoking and they have told me to "shut up". I just don't know what to do at all. 

So I guess my main thing here is: How do I help my boyfriend break his habit? How do I do it in a caring and loving manner without getting so frustrated? What can a person do in this situation? People that I have been in this situation before how did this work out for you?

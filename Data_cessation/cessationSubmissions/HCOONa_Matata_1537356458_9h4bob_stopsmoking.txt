What are your favorite parts about being an ex-smoker? Or maybe some pros that you never thought about untill you quit?

I'll start. I no longer have to check to make sure I brought smokes and a lighter before I leave the house. Pockets feel nice and roomy and I dont have that cigarette pack protruding from my Jean pockets announcing to the world that I have a filthy habit.

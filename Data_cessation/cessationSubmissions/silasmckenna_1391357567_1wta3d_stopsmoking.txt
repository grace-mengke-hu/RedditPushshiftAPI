Lungs + Cracking up;

It has been somewhere in the 5-6 week range since I've smoked.  I'd been smoking for 7 years (still a youngin').

I never got up to smoking more than half a pack a day and even half a pack would cause my throat to get scratchy.  I've never experienced "deathly cravings" when being forced to do something for hours with no chance to smoke, like a lot of those here seem to experience.  However, I would have cravings throughout the day.. some of which were stronger than others (and when I could, I would fulfill them).

1]  In this 5-6 weeks, I figured my lungs would be rejecting a lot of the buildup in there.  Nope.  Does this not happen?  Is there some way to detoxify the lungs?  I know I've done permanent damage, but I was expecting some signs of repair.

2]  Mentally, I feel 10000x better.  However, physically I haven't noticed much difference.  The only thing I can really notice is the circulation in my body--my gums felt very strange as they got accustomed to the new level of bloodflow and I've been able to tell the difference of the amount of blood reaching places in my body when I stand/sit/lay.


I'm unsure of where I stand.  Stopping smoking was not all that difficult.  The cravings hit harder for a week or so and the frustration gets to me like once a day (but is lessening each instance).

I'm just not sure I see the benefits physically or that there was a reason to quit.  I've found charts that say all this stuff happen within a couple of weeks but I haven't experienced any of that.  I'm beginning to wonder if it's all a load of bull and smoking actually isn't all that bad for you.  It doesn't seem like it was all that it was cracked up to be.

Thoughts?

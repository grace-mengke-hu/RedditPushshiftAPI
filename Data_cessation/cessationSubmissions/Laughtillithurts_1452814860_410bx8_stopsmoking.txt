Today I'm starting again

Although it pains me to say it, I've been a smoker for nearly ten years. I remember growing up and watching my sister smoke and thinking to myself "Why would anyone do that?", but here I am. I've tried to quit before, usually to little success. The majority of my friends and coworkers are smokers, so one bummed cigarette turns to a pack, turns back into a habit. 

My girlfriend (who hates the habit) has been encouraging em to try to quit again. And when that didn't work more strongly encouraging... When I think about it I know I want to quit, but I also know that in that one moment I'll want a cigarette. My triggers are driving, work and drinking, so I wish I could just take two weeks to lock myself at home. On a (rare) day off, I can go a whole day without even thinking about a cigarette, but it's been less than 3 hours and I'm already wishing I had one. 

Any advice to help keep me on track? Words of encouragement? Some magic trick that I've been missing out on?

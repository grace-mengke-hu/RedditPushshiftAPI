STICK WITH IT to stop smoking

Podcast with the Author, Sean Young, PhD: http://www.artofmanliness.com/2017/08/10/podcast-science-behavior-change/

The Book: https://www.amazon.com/Stick-Scientifically-Process-Changing-Life/dp/0062692860

After hearing the podcast, I bought and read the book in preparation to quit. Also made spreadsheet to collect all the steps/techniques to help me tackle this stop smoking change. I can share the spreadsheet once I figure out how, but I thought some might like to check it the podcast first, it's much better than words I could put down.

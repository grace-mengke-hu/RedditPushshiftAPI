After 2 weeks, immune system low? Body is so exhausted

Hello all. It's been 2 weeks since I quit smoking. (Previous 15 years of smoking daily)

After the initial cravings and discomfort, I went for a run and found that it was so much easier to breathe. Usually when I ran I felt like I struggled to breathe but this time it was so exhilarating and I wasn't out of breath at all! 

Then I caught a cold, usual changing of seasons here in England. I've had this damn cold for almost 2 weeks now, when usually it would take me a couple days to recover from a cold. I'm constantly blowing my nose day to night. I've also developed an eye infection. 

This week I have been so tired, like totally exhausted. Like wanting to sleep as soon as I wake up. I usually go for a long walk but this week I couldn't even leave the house. 

Also erm I noticed I have had loads of flatulence this week. I haven't changed my diet or eaten anything strange! 

Also in the mornings I've had this horrible taste in my mouth when I wake up even though I haven't smoked for 2 weeks. Is this just all the 15 years of horrible mucus clearing out of my lungs?

Also throughout all of this I'm dealing with depression and irritability. 

I feel like a blubbering nose dripping boulder farting mess! 

Are these symptoms all totally normal for someone who is quitting smoking? I guess I just want someone to tell me that all this discomfort is due to me quitting smoking and that it will all eventually pass. 

According to an article I read online in weeks 3-4 weeks the headaches are gonna come. I'm bracing myself.

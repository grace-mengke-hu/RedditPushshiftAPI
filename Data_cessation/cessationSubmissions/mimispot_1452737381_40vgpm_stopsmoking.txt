I'm an anger monster on day 5

I have a headache a toothache some pretty severe anger and anxiety outbursts. But no cravings. I'm far too miserable to be craving and frankly nothing inside me wants a cigarette or believes it would make this shitty monster go away. Oh and I dreamt that Steve buscemi was murdering my dad and my PhD advisor with a butcher knife. So yea this is  terrible but quitting was easy as fuck.

First day, help

It's been 12 hours and I'm at work and I can't stop fantasising about going home and having one on my balcony listening to some nice music. I feel on edge I really just want this feeling to go away and it hasn't even been one day! Work is pretty stressful atm because my coworker keeps stuffing up. Help please

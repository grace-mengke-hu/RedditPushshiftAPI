Just be careful with NRT

Or nicotine replacement therapy. Initially in Jan 2016 the nicotine spray I used helped me really a lot in quitting. From 20 cigs, I went all the way down to 4 a day. In March 2016 I didn't even need the spray. 

Fast forward in May 2016 I relapsed due to personal circumstances. 

In September I quite again and relied heavily on the spray. I decided to quit even the spray (because it is not cheap as well). I just realized how dependent I was on it because not using it reminded me of when I first stopped smoking: I feel disoriented, in need of something, and bored. 

Bottom line: Use NRT to help you deal with the worst of cravings, not just any minor cravings. The idea is to quit smoking/nicotine, rather than replace one addiction (cigs) with another (nicotine spray). 

I'm writing this to help me with a bad craving fit as much as it is advice so hope you don't mind.

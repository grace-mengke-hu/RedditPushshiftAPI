Three weeks clean, never felt better

I just randomly decided three weeks ago while smoking to stop smoking, saying to myself: "This will be the last cigarette I'll ever smoke." I'm off to a good start, I'm not even attracted to the idea of smoking again.

Plus, the following idea is very encouraging: I've tried to quit a million times before, but I've felt like a piece of shit when I relapsed for not following my own rules and decisions. This time is different, I actually feel great for doing myself a favor. I save money and my health, what's not to like?

I wonder if I can keep this up until I die.

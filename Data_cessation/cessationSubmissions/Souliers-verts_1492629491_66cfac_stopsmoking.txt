Day 4 (almost) done! Stuff stinks?

Well, my cold is starting to go away so my nose is clearing out. I think it's because I stopped smoking but I can smell almost everything really strongly now.

Almost puked while leaving my apartment building because all the hallways smell really strongly of smoke. Went to the ocean, everything smelled really salty. But that was pretty cool with all the fresh sea air.

I live in a country where it seems the majority of adults not only smoke, but smoke a lot. It was hard controlling the cravings but I managed!

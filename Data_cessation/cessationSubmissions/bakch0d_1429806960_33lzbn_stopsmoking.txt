Its been a month !

Quit cold turkey and its been a month, never thought I would make it this far ! 

I have to remind myself that I quit smoking poison sticks several times in a day but I would say it's worth it when compared to benefits of being a non-smoker. I see several people outside of my work, staring at their phones and smoking as if on autopilot and I feel proud of myself that I am not one of them. 

Cravings are also pretty strong when I am drinking alcohol but I keep telling myself that non-smokers are also enjoying and having a good time without having the need to smoke. Honestly, it's not fun because I cannot let go of myself, my inhibitions... takes the fun out of a night of drinking with buddies when you have to constantly resist the urge to smoke. Pretty sure my body has given up the addiction but its still a fight within my head. But hey it's my head and I command it. 

* Can breath better and deeper -- check

* increased stamina and can run a little longer -- check
* time and money saved -- check

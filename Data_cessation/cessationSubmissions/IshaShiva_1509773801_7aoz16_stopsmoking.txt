Day 5 (again) &amp; stoked

I love being a nonsmoker. Glad I am not sneaking it &amp; hiding it from family - guilty pleasure was really not a pleasure - messed w/ my nervous system &amp; sleep. I often opted out of things, so I could smoke! Doing daily meditation &amp; pranayama exercises, getting outdoors as much as possible &amp; juicing like crazy - I swear itâ€™s been the best nicotine replacement- I am crazy high on vegetables ðŸ˜œðŸ˜˜ðŸ’œ

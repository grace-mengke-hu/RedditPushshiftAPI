Started smoking at 7..

First time I smoked I was 7 years old.. I would sneak around and smoke cigarettes but eventually quit at 9 (I would maybe smoke a packs worth in a month to 1 1/2 months).. I started back up around 11 and have smoked (with the exception of a couple breaks) since then.. now, turning 21 in a couple days, I have smoked for over half of my life... I have tried quitting but I enjoy smoking too much. I smoke when I am bored, stressed, having fun, literally everything and I have no idea how to quit. I don't feel the need to smoke either.. it just happens. Going a day/week/month without cigarettes doesn't bother me at all and I don't crave to smoke again but I always do for some reason.. I have no idea how to stay away from them for good. Any tips?

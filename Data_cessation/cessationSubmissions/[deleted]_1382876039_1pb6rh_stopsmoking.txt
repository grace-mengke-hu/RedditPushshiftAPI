Up and running!

Hello all,

I've been smoking for between 3 and 4 years now and know/feel I have to quit. Had a biiig party last night as my last au revoir wave to cigarettes.

I have been trying to quit since quite some time now, failed a billion times already. I once only managed to abstain for three months, but it was entirely through willpower and doomed to fail at some point.

Now my problem is, that in my head I still feel I love the drug, which is a part of nicotine's trickstery. I chose not wait any more for the "special, genuine desire to quit", since I view myself as horribly addicted to the drug, stripped of my own rational judgement.

So far - so good. It's been around 12 hours since my last cig, my head is quite dizzy and I'm at work listening to LOUD music in my headphones and having a gargantuan amount of water and coffee. Later on in the day, I plan on preparing some herbal tea to help me with cleaning up my nose/throat.

A question to anyone considering themselves related - I occasionally smoke pot and enjoy it quite as much. There is this common in Europe, where you mix the stuff with tobacco, making it burn more evenly, with lesser intensity and generally rendering the smoke more pleasant and "easy". The amount of tobacco used is never more than 50% of the total mixture. We usually use 0.3 gr for a biiiig spliff. Has anyone experienced cravings induced by this little amount of tobacco? In case I decide to smoke, should I avoid the tobacco entirely? Thanks!

Messed up, it was bad, reset badge, never again

I caved after 10 smoke free days and smoked at a festival. I ended up doing the whole, oh well, I've started now - might as well continue. This is the worst idea. 

It was horrible, my throat was a mess when I woke up and I smelt awful (particularly because I was camping). I had a really nasty cough and just felt crappy. The next day, I went to see bands and drank - this time I didn't touch one. 

So here's to day two (again).

I am already feeling pretty good and the withdrawal isn't totally terrible. I am however about to eat my bodyweight in takeaway pretty soon.

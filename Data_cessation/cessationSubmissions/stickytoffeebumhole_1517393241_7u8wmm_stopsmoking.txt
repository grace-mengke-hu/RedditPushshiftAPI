Hi everyone, 

&amp;nbsp;


I made a minimalist, geometric, 365 day habit tracker, to help my wife give up smoking…thought some of you might like to try it out. 

&amp;nbsp;


Disclaimer: I’m not a smoker and I know nothing about how to give up. My wife decided to go cold turkey over the summer, and I made this so she could track her progress and her pain :(

&amp;nbsp;
 

It's based on 'Don't Break The Chain'. Just cross off each day you’re smoke free. Your goal is to keep building your chain of X's . 

&amp;nbsp;

(here's a photo of my wife’s tracker from a few weeks ago: https://imgur.com/cJYZEpe)

Download it [here](https://yearofaweso.me) (it's free and no email required), print it out, stick it to your wall and start your year of being smoke free and awesome.

Cheers

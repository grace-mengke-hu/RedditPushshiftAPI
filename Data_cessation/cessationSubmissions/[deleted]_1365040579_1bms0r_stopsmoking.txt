(30 In) day 29 and 30 were the crazy..

I've stopped getting out often, besides gym or to eat etc no clubs parties or other social activities, I've had my license suspended for 6 months and I just got it back. I guess that's what has helped me get this far. Yesterday(29) ended up at an airport and all the people smoking outside.. the smell just hit me really hard passing by all the smokers made me feel like I've had a cigarette myself. Then later a person I was picking up from the airport to my surprise was a smoker.. and not just a regular smoker but a smoker like I used to be, chain-smoking almost.
I was offered a cigarette, politely declined, dealt with smoking inside the car and that was that.

Fast forward to today, my friend has left me his car for a couple of days while hes on vacation, he told me I can use it so I used it to go get some food. I wanted to check for car registration in case I got pulled over.. and what do I find instead?? A pack of American Spirits just the kind I loved and they we some imported kind (Imagine the Smeagol from LOTR) I picked up the pack looked at it.. took out a cigarette smelled it.. thought all kinds of shit for 30 seconds and put it back. Tomorrow is a new day and I hope to keep this going. To everyone else who's in the quitting boat best of luck!

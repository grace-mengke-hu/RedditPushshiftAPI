1 month anniversary and crashed my car...

1 month off the smokes and was driving to work yesterday when the person in front stopped suddenly, I braked but hit ice and went into the back of them. Both cars and both drivers were fine (just a wee bit shaken up). The funny thing is that it didn't even cross my mind to have a cigarette. Hours later it occurred to me that 1 month ago the first thing I would done would be to light a cigarette. I don't miss smoking one bit. I think my mindset has a lot to do with it. I genuinely don't feel like I've lost anything or given something up but more that I've gained everything (time, health, money etc). I really see myself as a non-smoker and therefore deal with situations as a non-smoker would. I'll always be aware that I can't ever have one puff but right now I couldn't think of anything more disgusting.

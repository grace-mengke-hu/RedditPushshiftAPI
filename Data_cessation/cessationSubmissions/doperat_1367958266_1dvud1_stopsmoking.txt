That first breath when you wake up

Feels so good. It used to feel like I had a tennis ball stuck at the bottom of my windpipe. It's just over a week but I'm doing great. Reading here everyday is great encouragement to keep going. We all know its worth it to give up. There is nothing beneficial about smoking. We just have to get through that first phase of nicotine addiction and then its just bad habits. I enjoy coming here everyday and seeing my badge +1. It reminds me that I'm in control. Good luck everybody. Thanks

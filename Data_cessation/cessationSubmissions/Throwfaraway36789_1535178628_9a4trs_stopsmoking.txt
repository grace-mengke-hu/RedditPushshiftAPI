Afraid my girlfriend will start again

We quit smoking together about 8 weeks ago. I struggle a bit with it, but not too bad.
She has mentioned that she would love a cigarette sometimes and a couple of days ago she asked if we wanted to go buy a new pack when I said that I had also thought about smoking a cig that day.
A couple of days ago she talked about how she would love it if she smoked again and talked about a couple situations where she would love to smoke.
I‘m afraid she‘ll start again especially since I‘ll have to move away for an internship for 5 months.
What can I do to help her not to start again?

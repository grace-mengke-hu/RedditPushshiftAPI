A confession...

Quick Back Story:
I smoked for about 12 years.  I quit for 5 years after reading  Alan Carr's book and quitting was actually "easy".
Presently:
Last September, I smoked a cigarette with a friend at work and all was good.  Then I had one with him in October.  Come January I'm back to almost a pack a day.  I have re-read Alan Carr's book twice and nothing is sticking.  I smoke freely at work but as soon as I get home I go into hiding mode and try to sneak one whenever I can.  I want to quit, I know for past experiences that it's easy but I just can't seem to take the jump.  
What is missing this time around?  
I hate smoking.  I feel bad every time I light up.  I don't want to do it anymore but the addiction seems much more stronger this time around even though I know it's all in my head.
I don't even know what I'm looking for.  Motivation? Encouragement?  A few knocks to the head to rattle my common sense back in charge of my decisions?

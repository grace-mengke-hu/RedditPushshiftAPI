quit 4 days ago, started using an e-cig. is that cheating, will it be hard for me in the long run?

i tried to quit before with the patch, (lasted 2 days) cold turkey, (lasted 4 months) and a bunch of other stop smoking aids that had minimal amounts of success. i recently quit and day 1 i was hurting pretty bad, so i stopped by a convenience store and picked up an e-cig and i've been puffing away on with like a pacifier since. my main question is; is that cheating? am i not really quitting, but shifting my addiction? do you think those things will hurt me more than cigarettes in the long run?

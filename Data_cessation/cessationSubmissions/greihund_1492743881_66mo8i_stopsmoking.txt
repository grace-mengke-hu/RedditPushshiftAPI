I am just posting so that I can look at my flair. I'm over a month, haven't screwed up once, but I'm packing for a move right now and holy shlamolee I wouldn't mind a smoke.

Yep, figured I'd get the important stuff out of the way in the headline. I'm not really looking for a cheering section or anything, because that's not really how I roll, I'm just sitting here writing this post instead of going out back for a smoke, because this is probably a better thing to do. Blah blah blah, yatta yatta, I'm just typing while I wait for the craving to pass. Aaaaaaaaaaaand...... done.

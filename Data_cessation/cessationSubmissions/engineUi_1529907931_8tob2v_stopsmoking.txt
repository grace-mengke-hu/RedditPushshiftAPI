3 months done

What a 3 months it has been, haven't touched one. been plenty of times i have wanted to so bad (arguments with GF, drinking and girlfriend still smoking). this is longest i have quit, i am so proud of myself. i am not the most strongest willed person but i have done it. i still crave and i still look every other day to see how long its been since i last smoked but i WILL stay smoke free!  i WILL stay smoke free!  i WILL stay smoke free! 

i wish you all good luck on your quitting journey. you can do it!

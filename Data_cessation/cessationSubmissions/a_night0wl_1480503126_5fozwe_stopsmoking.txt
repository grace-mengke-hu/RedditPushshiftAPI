Turned 18 a couple months ago, driven to smoke out of stress/depression. Need advice :/

To be honest I don't really think my "addiction" is even that bad. I haven't smoked for a very long time at all compared to most people I see on this sub, in fact I wouldn't even say it's been more than two months. 

When I did smoke, it was really only about two a day, three at max, but definitely at least one when I could find time. Now it's almost always on my mind and I really need to quit before it really gets out of hand. If not for the sake of myself, for the sake of loved ones and those that care about my health. 

When I started, I kept repeating "oh it's only one. You won't get addicted from one, right?" Well now I'm not so sure.

I stopped for about three days after smoking two to three cigs a day consistently and today I had one and I'm just so disappointed with myself.

Any advice? 

TL;DR
Picked up light smoking, finding it harder than first imagined to quit. Tips? (Random note I hear a coyote outside my house and it's kind of cool :P)

36 hours 11 minutes since my last cigarette. (story inside...)

After 8 years of not going more than 24 hours without smoking I finally made a choice to make it this long without a cigarette. I decided to stop smoking because lungs have really begun started to hurt. The pain in my lungs amplified my already intense anxiety, so I figured I would see if they would still hurt if I stopped smoking. Lo and behold my lungs have been feeling better ever hour. I no longer have the sharp pains that I had been feeling for years. Or at least not nearly as frequently. So that's the positive.

On the other side of it, holy hell I feel like shit. I feel like I can barely remember today. I don't think I was able to focus on anything. I tried to read a bit throughout the day, but could never make it past a few pages. I know I watched a few episodes of some shows on netflix today, but what were they about? Everything seems so groggy. Everything seemed to make me angry. I felt so out of it getting behind the wheel seemed dangerous.

I'm afraid I won't make it through tomorrow. I'm going to sleep soon so that will give me a free 8 hours of no smoking, but I am meeting with a friend for lunch who smokes. It's going to be tough to not bum one off him. I really want to hit that 72 hour mark. Or at least the 48 hour mark.

The hardest part (if I make it that far) is going to be this weekend when I am out being social [Drinking beer.] 

I'm starting to convince myself to make it as far as I can this week then start over again trying to quit on Monday, but maybe that's just the nicotine talking.

Holy crap the cravings are evil

Today I woke up in the middle of the night thinking "i have no cigs for tomorrow". I spent the morning EXTREMELY anxious, like I needed tobacco to breathe! I have taken some very pleasurable and addictive drugs in the past and my " cravings" for those are merely cognitive ("That was nice, I hope I'll do it again some time "), not " AAAAHHH I FUCKING NEED SOME NICOTINE AAAAAHHH"

Everytime I say "this is the last one", my addict brain automatically creates an unconscious backdoor for the return of nicotine. Something like " yeah, lets see if you can really quit, you weak human. I'm already preparing some compelling arguments for you to smoke tomorrow". It's inescapable, it seems...

How the hell do people get rid of this?

Tomorrow is the big day. I've done this several times before, but this time is the last.

I've read Allen Carr's book twice before. Made it nine months the first time and three months the second time. Last real quit attempt was nine years ago. Smoking that one when I was drinking tripped me up, and the time has just gone by so fast. I'm beating this this time.

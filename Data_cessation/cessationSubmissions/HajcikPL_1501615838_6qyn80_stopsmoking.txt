136 days without nicotine

I should be real proud of myself but I'm not, really.
I'm addicted to nicotine in form of vaping.
I... really regret quitting because it was intentionally for someone and I wish to go back.
So someone shall ask - why won't you go back then?
Well, it's not that simple on the first glance of an eye.
I have reached something, over 130 days without. I don't need nicotine anymore, I don't have such cravings, I never smoked in the past 2 years to relief the stress.
I was vaping because I loved it, and I still do but I never used it in form of getting over my stress.
It would be just weird for me to go back and I'm more stressed about picking up a cigarette rather than not smoking at all.

I made a mistake.
Before you quit - have a reason.
Any reason is good, but I never had one, that was my mistake and I regret it.

Any thoughts?

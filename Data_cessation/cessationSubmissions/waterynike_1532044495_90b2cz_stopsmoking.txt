Just a friendly reminder-while our lungs and bodies do weird things with quitting don’t assume everything is related to stop smoking and see your doc.

I quit about 4-5 weeks ago. Since July 3rd I have felt terrible, my lungs hurt, been lethargic and just feeling like death. My lungs would burn especially while/after exercising and I kept doing it thinking it was helping.

I went to urgent care and have something called bronchospasms. I am now on steroids and an inhaler for 5 days and have to follow up with my primary. I am scared shitless that this will be permanent or I have COPD or something but they didn’t say either of those things.

I have felt like crap because I must have had a cold sometime recently. I am splayed on the couch with my lungs hurting. Keep up with your health and remember NOT EVEN ONE MORE!

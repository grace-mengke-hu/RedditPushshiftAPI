Haven’t smoked for 24 hours. Now I’m drunk and craving

I’m 25 and have been smoking since I was 14. I hate what it’s doing to me and I’m making a real effort to stop for good. I’ve quit for months in the past a few times but it never lasts. 

I’m really craving a cigarette now and just wanted to post to get it out of my system and maybe get some support

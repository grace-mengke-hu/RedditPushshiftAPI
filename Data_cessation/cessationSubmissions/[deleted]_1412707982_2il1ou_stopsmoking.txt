HELP. NEED DEsperately to stop smoking Need advice. I want to make another attempt to stop smoking. This is what I tried to far....

2 months ago I quit smoking. I read ALLEN CArr's book. I was smoking 1.5 packs a day, then quit cold turkey. I lasted a few weeks. It was too painful. I tried exercising. meditating. it was way to painful. i picked up again. 

I smoke a pack a day. and i want to stop. I am afraid to quit cold turkey. Should I taper down a lil then stop?  Also I've been looking into smoking cessation programs, but I believe that's not necessary and I can stop on my own, with the allen car method. It's so frustrated to quit then be in so much pain. 

can anyone share with me any advice. on what will work for me?

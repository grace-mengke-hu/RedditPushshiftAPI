Today I have surpassed one week. I never thought it was possible. Today I had a really rough day and I know I was an ass to some people. They understood. It's amazing. The feeling of choosing *not* to smoke. I swear I always thought I would never have that choice.

Thanks for reading. I know this isn't mind blowing or some great story but I am glad this sub exists so I am able to get it off my chest to some people who it means something to.

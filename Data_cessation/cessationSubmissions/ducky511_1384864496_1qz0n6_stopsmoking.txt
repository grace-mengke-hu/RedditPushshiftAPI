No smoking in the wood shop!

I did it! i have had a long time habbit of smoking while i work. I usally have a design and build day with a budy of mine on sundays, and you better belive i would smoke like a chimney. 

This was the first sunday since i quit we got togeather. Not only did i not smoke but i didnt even really have a craving!

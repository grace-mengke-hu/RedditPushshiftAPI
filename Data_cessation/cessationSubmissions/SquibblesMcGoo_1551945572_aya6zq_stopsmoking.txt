Day 65: Was it really this easy?

Just over two months smoke free and I gotta say, not smoking after the first week was much easier than I anticipated. I get a few short moments of moderate cravings a couple times a week but they're pretty easy to resist. Aside from that, smoking doesn't really even cross my mind.

Waiting for the three month pitfall though, I'm wondering if things will get harder or if I'll just keep going strong. Anyway, I'm so happy things are going this well!

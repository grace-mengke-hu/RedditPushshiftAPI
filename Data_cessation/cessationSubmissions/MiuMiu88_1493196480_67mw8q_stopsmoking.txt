Tarot for Quitting

Hello eveyone, 

So, I am 37 days into quitting. Pretty proud of myself! I changed A LOT. I quit, I left a relationship situation that was toxic. I moved back to my old place. I managed not to drink, relapse, bug people too much or freak out too hard. 
Before leaving this place I started working on a mural. Now that I am back I would love to finish it. But for the time being the move and the turmoil kind of drained me financially. I don't have any money to buy paint and supplies. So, I would like to offer my services as a Tarot reader. This can assist you with anything from helping with quitting (it helped me A LOT) to learning how to properly navigate the troubled waters of the dating world. 
If anyone is interested, please let me know! 
Thank you and best of luck with all your healthy goals!

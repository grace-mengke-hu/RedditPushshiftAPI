Even when it is hard, refrain.

Four weeks ago today I had my last cigarette.

I have always used cigs as a stress reliever,  and even when I was 'not smoking' for about 8-10 years I would buy a pack in times of high stress/ grief/ upset.

Well, in the last 28 days I have had a beloved pet die in my arms, had a grandparent pass away and have been in chronic pain due to three bulging discs in my neck BUT I HAVE NOT SMOKED. I now understand that it doesn't help alleviate stress or discomfort, it creates the stress and discomfort. 

So, life sucks a bit for me at the moment, but I am still proud as hell that I am conquering this habit for once and for all.

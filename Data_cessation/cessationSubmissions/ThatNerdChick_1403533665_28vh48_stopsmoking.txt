One year today!

Man, it feels good to finally hit that year mark. Six months in I was worried I've cave and not make it. The last couple of months have been better and I hardly think about cigarettes at all these days. 

I love how much happier I am. I can breathe better, I sleep better and no more mood swings.  Cheers to 1 years and many, many more to come!

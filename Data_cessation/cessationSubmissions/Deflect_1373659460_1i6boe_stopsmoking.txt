It feels great being a non-smoker.

I have never really tried to quit, sometimes I've thought to myself, "Man, this should be my last pack."  Sometimes I thought to myself "Who cares, I'm young.  I'll quit later."  But at age 22 I've finally quit, I started smoking when I was 17-18 and the last couple years it was almost a pack a day sometimes it was a pack a day.

Anyway, it's been more than a week now and it's great not having to go grab one every hour or less.  Not smelling like extreme smoke (Marlboro Reds), and not feeling like I was going to die sometimes when waking up or even going to sleep.  I started coughing a little too, that's pretty much almost gone.  Actually, I rarely cough.  Not that it's bad to cough, but I notice the difference.  I feel a lot healthier that's for sure, of course I crave a cigarette every once in a while, but I remind myself how disgusting it is and the cravings are gone almost instantly.

I have been doing a lot of research on vaporizers (electronic cigarettes) and I am going to buy a decent one with 0 nicotine just to have something blow out of my mouth for that oral fixation.  It will just be for flavor.  It will be nice to take out to a bar, to drink, or talk with friends or just vapor in general for that "throat hit."   Anyway, wish you guys all luck.  It is easy to stop smoking, all you have to do is simply stop.  :)

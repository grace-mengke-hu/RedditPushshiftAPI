What's the best method?

I have been starting to notice just how unhealthy I was getting and I realized smoking a pack a day played a large role in that. I didn't smoke a cigarette yesterday for 15 hours before I snapped and bought a pack after a few beers. I smoked the last one this morning and gave the rest of the pack to a friend. I'm trying quit again except I don't know which method will work the best cold turkey or getting patches and gum. 

My university will provide me with free quitting materials, what method to quitting have you guys had the best results with.

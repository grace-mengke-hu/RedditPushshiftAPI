Smoking contributing to depression?

Hello everyone, this is such a great sub.

Apologies if this has been covered before but I was wondering what you guys think about something.

Do you think that smoking itself can contribute to depression?

I feel like when I smoke it completely ruins my motivation and kind of shuts me down in a way. I feel like I have no energy not only physically but also mentally, however that works. I think  this mental shut down leads to stagnation which leads to (for me at least) depression.

Does my poor description sound familiar to anyone?

Luckily I'm a few days into quitting and I already feel so much more optimistic and motivated (currently looking for a job)

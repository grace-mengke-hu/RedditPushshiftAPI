Lapse or relapse

So I smoked again 2 days ago, after 12 days of not smoking. It was so good and so bad at the same time. But it was bad more than good. Yesterday I smoked a pack. Today.. I'll see if I'll smoke or not.

The thing is, I know I wasn't ready to quit. The first time I had quit it lasted 2 months and it was a walk in the park. Any relapse I had I dismissed it in 3 seconds. No matter how strong it was. I just didn't want to smoke anymore and that was fine that time. I made a mistake, as it was my first time quitting, that I could have just one. I told this story at least 2 times here already and I hope this will be the last :D

This time, tho, I didn't want to smoke anymore but I didn't yet come to that place in myself where I am 100% confident about that. I was having doubts. And because of that, during those 12 days of non smoking, I was CONSTANTLY obsessing over cigarettes. How I miss them, the feeling, the smell, the taste (yep, it's all pretty good to me now. That's sad). Because of that obsession I was browsing this subreddit, whyquit.com and other various sites. I was looking at my quit counter every 30 minutes and that made it seem like hours passed. And every day I knew I wasn't ready for this shit... 

This all may be me lying to myself, that is, the addiction lying to myself. Or I really wasn't ready. Anyway, I think I'll maybe, probably have a smoke, and see you guys in some time with a brand new badge. I just gotta put things into place. 

P.S. Don't follow my footsteps or my reasoning. Stay quit!

Had a nightmare last night, in which I smoked a cigarette...

...behind everyone's back and i remember i got this really fucking sick feeling in the pit of my stomach. i felt ashamed and sad because i remember also thinking 'this is it, now ill never quit again'. it felt so real and i still feel a bit nauseous and I'm feeling kinda sad as well

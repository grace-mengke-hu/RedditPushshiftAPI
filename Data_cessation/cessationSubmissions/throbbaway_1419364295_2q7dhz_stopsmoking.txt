[Day 1] This is why I want to quit smoking

I woke up today and haven't had a cigarette. I almost smoked one just now but drank water instead. Let this list be a reminder of the why I should not smoke ever again:

* I cough before going to bed.
* I cough in the morning.
* I have bad cardio.
* I have mucus in my lungs.
* I sometimes wheeze when I breathe.
* Some of the adverse effects of tobacco addiction can be reversed, it's not too late to live a healthy life.
* I will save money.
* I'm going to smell better.
* I'm going *to smell* better.
* [Edit] I have an early-onset of Barrett's Esophagus and smoking will make it worse and lead to really bad things.

Alright can I do this?

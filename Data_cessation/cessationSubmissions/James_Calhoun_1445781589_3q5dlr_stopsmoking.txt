Currently 11 days in. Exercising is going great!

So I am currently 11 days in my quit and since then I started running on a daily basis. Its unbelievable how fast I'm improving without cigarettes holding me back. Going to start lifting weights this week as well! I am proud of myself and of this community, thank you guys for supporting me!

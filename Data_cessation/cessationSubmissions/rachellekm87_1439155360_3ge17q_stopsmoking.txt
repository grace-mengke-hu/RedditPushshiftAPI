Quitting Smoking today

So today is my quit date. I have tried going cold turkey multiple times to no avail. I just find the withdrawal symptoms to much to handle. I work at a very demanding job, and I can't just take of 3 days to beat the symptoms. I wish that was the case but I can't. So Ive decided to try the patches. I put my first one on today. So far so good. Only downside is it's super itchy. I am fighting the urge to itch it, which in turn is keeping my mind of wanting to smoke. Trying to stay glass half full. Wish me luck!!

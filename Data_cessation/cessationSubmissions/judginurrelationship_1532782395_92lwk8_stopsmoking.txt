Who the hell says every time you quit gets easier?

I've quit before.  I've made it up to a few months a few times.

I'm 25 hours in and it's never ever been like this. I'm agitated. I'm suicidal. I'm having strongly violent urges. I basically gave a SEVERE MDMA comedown without having had any. I dont know what to do.

Quit - Day One

I get up for work. Wash my face, slapping water on my eyes, literally. Dressed up and ready to go. Searching my pockets, house keys? Check. Car keys? Check. Work keys? Check. Wallet? Check. Pack of cigarettes?

I like coffee, but not in the same category as a "I can't wake up without coffee" person. I can wake, and wait, for my first cup of morning coffee. Only problem is the habit of puffing away on my main enemy all the while sipping a nice hot cup of coffee. But I must take my mind off of it. I can't let a simple(!) man made product chain my mind. Surely I have enough will and determination to march on.

I'm now few hours into work and I've only had one or two moments of craving. I don't know why, but I'm drinking a lot of tea. I love tea, but the way I'm going, it wouldn't be a surprise if I had tea poisoning, or addiction for that matter.

It's now nearing the end of my shift. After seeing some smokers I've had moments. Moments of questioning how I started smoking altogether. I hated it growing up but looking back 8 years now, for 8 years I've exhausted my lungs. I've ripped into my own fragile flesh with my own hands. I've strained and hammered my already broken heart for no good reason.

I can't pity myself for something that's already been done though. Not forever. I must move on. I can't get back into the vicious circle of stress>smoke>guilt>stress>smoke. That must end too. It will, it is.

The usual stuff has all been done. Shower, dinner, news, friends, a little reading. I've had cravings, especially after dinner. My jaws tightening, clamping, I can hear my teeths grinding against each other. Just imagining how relaxing it could be if only... and then I remember I've stopped.

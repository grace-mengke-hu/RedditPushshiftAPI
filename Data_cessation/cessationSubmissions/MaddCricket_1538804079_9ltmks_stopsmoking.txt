Day 21.

“How do you feel now?”  My never-smoked-before-in-their-life-coworkers ask me.

“Like I want a cigarette.”  I answer and receive looks of anger and fear.  Then I explain how I feel like I want one but I’m not going to have one, and remind them it’s a drug addiction that isn’t going to disappear overnight and their judgmental looks aren’t helping me.


It’s not so much a craving, but just a sincere want for one.  Like when your best friend moves across country and you’re wanting to spend the evening with them...that kind of sincere want.  It isn’t going to happen, but it’s there.

Insomnia is still here...that’s partly my fault though as I get into watching movies way past my bedtime lol.  

Breathing is still a little tricky, especially at bedtime when I feel like my lungs are tight, but during the day I’m breathing deeply and freely.  

I sat one of my breaks next to my friend who was smoking and though it didn’t smell the best, it was somewhat comforting (stressful day at work today), and proud to say I had no urge to ask for a drag or steal a full one off her.  I was absolutely content to just sit there and watch.

I still feel the want, but I have no urge to act upon it.  Must mean it’s getting better!!! There’s a light and I can feel it.  I hope everyone else is doing great.  Never another puff!!!

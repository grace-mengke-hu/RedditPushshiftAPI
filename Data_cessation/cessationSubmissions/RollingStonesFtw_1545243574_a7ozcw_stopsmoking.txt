Why should I quit smoking?

The title probably sounds ridiculous but hear me out - I’m on the fence about quitting smoking. 
I’m 20 years old and have been smoking for a little less than 5 years, started off as a social smoker on weekends but it gradually became more. At the moment I smoke around 2 cigarettes a day during the week and maybe half a pack when I’m out drinking with my friends (who all smoke btw), but can also go a few days with no cigarette.


Now I (obviously) know it’s bad for me and I’m aware that it’s a stupid thing to do, but at the moment it’s not really a financial problem and the health risks just seem so far away. Right now smoking seems to mostly impact my life positively as it’s a big social plus for me. I think that’s also the main thing holding me back from quitting, I’ve met the nicest people while having a smoke outside.

On the other hand I did notice recently  I’m out of breath quicker and I get that annoying feeling of wanting a cigarette. I’ve also read Allan Carr’s book and now I feel like a complete idiot for continuing to smoke, because I’ve realised that it’s just drug addiction and brain-washing.

I can’t seem to do it because of the social factor. I’ve had so many great conversations while on the balcony with other smokers, I’m scared of giving that up. 

Do you guys have any advice? I’d be really thankful

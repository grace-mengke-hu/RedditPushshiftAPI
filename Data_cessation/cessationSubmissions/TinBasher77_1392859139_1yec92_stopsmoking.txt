What to do when the monster consumes your every waking thought?

Literally the moment I wake up I'm already thinking about having that first smoke.  I've tried quitting so many times that I've lost count.  I don't want to be a smoker, but the mental obsession is often the reason I break down.  Anyone else have this problem or know what I can do to make it easier?  Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

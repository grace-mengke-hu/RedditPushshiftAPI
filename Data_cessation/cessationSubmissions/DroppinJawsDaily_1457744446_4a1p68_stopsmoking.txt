I have no desire to smoke anymore. Screw starting tomorrow I'm done now.

At this point in my life I've actually come to hating this habit. The hole it burns it my wallet is pretty bad but affecting my health and self esteem is worse. 

Good bye disgusting cigarette breath, how ever long it takes. And welcome to all the money that'll go to my savings instead. I'm done smelling like an ashtray and I'd rather face what ever lies ahead. 

I'm leaving this as a place holder for for when I started and I'll document everything that I go through like a diary of some sort. I don't know how to describe my mindset right now.


But I feel content with what my body and mind is going to have to endure to get this shit out of my life. I have too much to live for. I'm better than this. Good riddance.

Sleeping vs Staying Awake

I am curious about the effects of sleeping vs being awake when quitting

I have searched everywhere and I cannot find anything to the question at hand, just other sleeping things unrelated to the question. 

For Example. If I stay awake longer, would it help me quit faster because im awake longer to deal with the cravings, or does sleeping more help, even though you arent craving in your sleep?

Im really curious about this, because I'm nearly at 24 hours of going cold turkey, and the cravings are getting worse, but I feel like if I sleep, ill just wake up and crave even more, for some reason my mind goes blank in the morning and the first thing I think of is to Pee and Smoke lol. but if I stay up longer than normally, than over time ill get over the craving faster, because on average I sleep only about 5-6 hours or less a night, where as the average person is roughly 7-9 hours of sleep or more. Is there any difference?

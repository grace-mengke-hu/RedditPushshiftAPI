Time to stop this insanity

Been smoking for 16 years, am 40 in December. Really feeling like smoking is the most insane decision I've made, my biggest regret in life. Lost my mum last April to COPD, she was 74 and smoked since she was a teenager.

So I've  stopped 3 times over the years, the longest was for a year. Tried patches last year but failed, reduced smoking to 5 a day at least. 

Trying the willpower approach this time. 

Just bought a pack of oranges and apples. Have done 2 3.5K runs this week. Time to kick this thing. 

Wish me luck :)

Dizziness?

Beginning of Day 3. It's been hard at times, but I'm in this for the long run; I will not be deterred.

Â 

I was prepared for the cravings, the lethargy, the irritability. But what I had no idea was coming was this dizziness. It started last night and has only gotten worse. Is this normal, just my body adjusting to higher O2 levels? How long should this last? I'm a bit uncomfortable driving like this, but have no alternative.

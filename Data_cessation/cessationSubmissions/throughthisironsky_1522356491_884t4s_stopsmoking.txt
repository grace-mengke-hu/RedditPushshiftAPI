Dear current smokers, please share with us how much you hate your smoking habit

Just an idea. I'm 14 days into this attempt and I try to remind myself how awful it was actually being addicted to smoking. So I thought why not ask current smokers to put it best and remind us what we're really missing.

So if you browse this subreddit but you haven't given up yet, you can help us by telling us how unpleasant it actually is.

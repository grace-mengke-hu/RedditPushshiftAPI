Unconventional advice from someone who has been tobacco free for 7 years

Find someone you HATE that smokes.  Whenever you have the urge to smoke, think of them and how much better you are for not smoking.  I know it's petty but it has been the one thing that has kept me motivated.  Anytime I have had a craving, I thought of my arch nemesis and my hatred has stopped that craving right in its tracks.  The thought of being as weak as her would just make my insides boil.  I started to be repulsed by cigarettes just because I associated them with her.  I haven't had any cravings (even while out drinking with smokers) in 4 years and I truly believe hating her has been the key.

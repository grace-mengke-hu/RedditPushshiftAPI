24 hours since last smoke.

Used to smoke 25-30 of the strongest available brand. I am using substitutes extremely liberally. Nicotine mouth spray. In my numerous other attempts I have tried without any or highly restricted use of substitute nicotine source and have failed _every single time_.

This time I use it as much as I feel like. And it is working. I can already feel my lungs clearing up! Breathing is improving _fast_. This time I don't care about getting dependent on substitute sources, because I've realized pretty much anything is better than getting the nicotine I am already very addicted to through smoking cigarettes. 

And this time I have no plan what so ever. I'll just keep on using the spray for whatever amount of time and quantity I feel like.

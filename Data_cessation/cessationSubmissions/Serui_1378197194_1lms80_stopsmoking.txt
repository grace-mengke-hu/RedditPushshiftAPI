1 glorious year. Thank you r/stopsmoking

This subreddit has given me the gift of not dying when I get to the 4th floor using the stairs, of not poisoning people who I love, of not wasting hard earned money on literally something that will eventualy kill me. With the help of this subreddit I stopped being a little bitch and kicked nicotines rapey tentacles off of myself for good. Thank you reddit.

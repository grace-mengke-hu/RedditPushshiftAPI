Quitting cigarettes is more than kicking nicotine. Less than a week and I'm more motivated than ever and quitting is benefitting more than just my health.

I'm 24 years old and smoked since I've been 16. I stumbled on to this subreddit and started reading through all the great success stories from you guys. I picked up Allen Carr's book and its been 4 days since I've smoked a cigarette. The first three days were exceptionally tough but you guys helped me resist. At one point I got so stressed I got in line to buy a pack and had to talk my reptile brain into leaving the store. Ever since then I feel like I can accomplish anything. 


If you can overcome the first days of withdrawal:


-You can motivate yourself when your body tells you to sleep

-You can go to the gym even when your tells you its too much work

-You can resist fast-food when your hungry

-You can get your mind of that ex girlfriend next time you see her



Quitting is all about self discipline. Learn from it. Benefit in all parts of life from it.

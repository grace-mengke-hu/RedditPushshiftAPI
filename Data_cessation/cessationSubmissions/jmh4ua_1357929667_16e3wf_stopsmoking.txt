Any advice/support is appreciated. Dilemma with smoking and Adderall.

Hey all, this is my 1st post to this subreddit as I just subscribed today. I have pretty much ignored smoking; I enjoy it, dont mind how much money I spend on them, and feel as though it is a huge reliever for my stress. With that said, it is apparent how taboo smoking has become in society now and I am also aware of just how heavily the cons outweigh the pros which are my two biggest reasons for being here. As the title suggest, my problem is that I am prescribed Adderall and take it daily (with the exception of most weekends). I am not sure if there is any correlation between Adderall and Cigarettes, but I only smoke when I take it. When I do not take it I have absolutely no desire to smoke and find it repulsive (unless I drink alcohol). On the flip side, I cannot stop taking Adderall because without it I am extremely lethargic and my focus/production levels are virtually non-existent. I have talked to my doctor about it in the past and have been prescribed many alternatives to Adderall, but the side effects I get from those drugs (e.g. Concerta, Focalin, Vivance, etc.) are... less-than-desirable. Depression, irritable, significantly less focus, and anxiety are the feelings I got from those that concerned me the most. History would suggest that my smoking is triggered by a catalyst such as Adderall or alcohol. I am not sure how to handle this or if I am just making excuses. But as you all probably know, Adderall allows most people to zero-in and have pin-point focus on whatever they are doing. This seems to have an extreme effect on cravings; meaning when I am at work and I crave a cigarette I can still focus on my work, but my mind will not let me distract itself from thought of smoking. I could possibly be over-analyzing this whole situation, but any advice from you guys would be appreciated.

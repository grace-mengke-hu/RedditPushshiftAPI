Cough and chest pain about a month or so in

Hello!

I quit about 6 weeks ago and I've gone through all the usual, but should I still have this cough? I've obviously read about the Cilia starting to work again but is this normal?

I smoked for about two years, at least half of this was just vaping.

Been to the doctors and they said everything seems normal and it should just go away on its own, no chest infection.

Some days I feel fine and actually had this weekend symptom free, however this morning the cough is back, feel like I'm trying to get mucus off my lungs although not really bringing anything up. Getting the odd chest pains and tightness.

Halp!

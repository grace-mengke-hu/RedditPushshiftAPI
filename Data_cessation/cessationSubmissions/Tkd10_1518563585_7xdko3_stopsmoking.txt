Tried a cigarette after a while, feel extremely guilty

Feel really bad. I'm not sure if i would be considered a smoker, but from about 16 to 20 (now 22) i tried maybe a total number of 20 cigarettes to be exact over that time, i guess about a pack over the course of 4 years.

My problem is i don't like cigarettes but the act of smoking in itself.

Long story short had an odd time fitting in at highschool, and i look up to a lot of actors like Ryan Gosling, Mark Wahlberg, Johnny Depp, James Dean etc.

But whenever i see a favourite actor of mine smoking it triggers something in me. I feel cool, acknowledged like i'm a badass or something.

Everytime i try one, i usually throw away the pack or only take a few puffs since i'm paranoid running into someone i know catching me. Even back then i would only try a few puffs then throw it on the ground in fear of getting caught.

I want to forget about them completely. I don't know why i feel cool when i would light one up, but i'm tired of the creepy thoughts. They keep coming back whenever i go through a dark or stressful period. Currently i've been busy with exams and have never felt this anxious before, not sure if that had something to do with it.

Today 2 years after my last one i tried 2 cigs, only half of each.

I would light up, try a few puffs, then throw it. Went for a walk, lit one up again then got rid of it. This time around it didn't even do anything for me, i don't know why i felt the urge to try it again.

Wish i could take those 20x attempts back, i will always carry that guilt with me.

From what i've heard from my mom, my dad tried them a bit in his youth too around my age then gave them up for her. I feel embarrassed to talk to him about it, he suspected once before that i tried them, i know he would be disappointed in me.

Feel awful right now, i just don't ever wanna see this side of me again.

Long time lurker...quitting again

Hi all, 

I've been a Reddit lurker for a while now but I decided to create an account to benefit from community accountability to stop smoking (again, for real this time, I swear!)

I've only been smoking for two years (weed really WAS a gateway drug for me ðŸ˜‰) and I'm in architecture grad school so I always fall back during reviews, finals etc, and occasionally after a few drinks.

I've been able to stop for a few months at a time but it's crazy how my mind can selectively erase my reasons for quitting, causing me to think it's NBD even though I have compelling health reasons to quit.

I've been on and off chantix (less effective each time, makes me nauseous), wellbutrin (no effect), and most recently Alan Carr's Easy Way audio book. After falling off five days after reading Carr, I decided I need some accountability and support.

I'm on a travel fellowship in China and ceremoniously finished my last cigarette yesterday on a sand dune in the desert. Hopefully I can leave my habit/addiction there as well!

Thank u very much, only because of u

Hi guys, today is 7th day of without smoking, only because of u guys I am able to quit smoking for 7 days and hope for continue. I am ok for last 6 and half day buy today evening I attend  a party, few old friend get together, we drink too much and  I drink 25000 ml of beer  and now I want to smoke but than the experience shared by u guys are come to mind like how someone not smoke in a cocktail party and feel proud in next morning , someone not smoke while others smoked. Some how because of this thoughths, I am able to skip, from smoking.
Thanku very much all of u
U made my day

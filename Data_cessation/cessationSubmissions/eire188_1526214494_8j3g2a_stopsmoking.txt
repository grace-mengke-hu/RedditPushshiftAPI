I want to quit

I have just gotten over a very tough breakup, and have been working to change my life around. For the last 3 months I have been smoking weed and cigarettes because I really didn't care, but in these last 2 weeks I have quit smoking weed and bought an ecig. I purchased a gym membership and have changed my diet around.

But I just can't get off the cigarettes. I am in my last year of school and under huge stress. I would consider myself a generally "fit" guy but every time I try to switch to an ecig I relapse. I would only have one a day, or a week depending if I have money. I just can't quit because i do love the feeling I get from cigs.

Sorry for the slightly long post, and I would highly appreciate any advice you guys can give me.

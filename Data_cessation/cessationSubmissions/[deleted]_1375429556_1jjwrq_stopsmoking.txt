Quit 6 days ago. Are this normal symptoms?

Hi,

I quit 6 days ago after almost 7 years of smoking and my arms, legs and my head feel very weak almost all day long. It starts to scare me a little bit. But I noticed that I can breath much better and yesterday when I was at the gym I managed to lift the same amount of weight as the last time.

I wake up 4-5 times at night and have big troubles sleeping through. But the weakness really starts to trouble me. I feel like a walking zombie for most of the day. How long does it take for me to get rid of this feeling? Is there anything I can do to make it go away?

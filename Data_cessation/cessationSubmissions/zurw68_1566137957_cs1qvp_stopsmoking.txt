Tough day

I have not smoked for 5 days. I find when I have a day off to be the hardest. So many triggers to want to smoke. A beer have a smoke, sit outside, have a smoke and on and on. I have reset my quit app so many times due to my mind playing games with me to justify just one.... pack and then I feel like shit. Not this time. I have to know that you can work in the garden, sit outside and not smoke. Pray for me

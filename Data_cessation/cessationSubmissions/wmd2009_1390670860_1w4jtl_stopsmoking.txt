Big night coming up.... What should I do?

I'll keep this short...
Three weeks into quitting and using gum has been amazing. I'm using 4mg pieces and I chew half at a time, in total using about 3 prices a day. 

I'm in a routine with my gum and to keep it strong I've tried to avoid the bars..on top of some other triggers.. As it's extra hard when I'd drink and being around a bunch of bars.

Anyhow, I'm running out of gum, like a few pieces left and my new supply of gum won't be here for 3 days....worse yet, it's the weekend and a friend is moving across the country...going away rager, smokers everywhere. What to do?

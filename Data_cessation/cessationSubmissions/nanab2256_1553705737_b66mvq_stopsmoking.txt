Almost lost it

Today's day 19 for me and I woke up desperate for a smoke. I got in the car, still in my jammies,  and headed for the smoke shop.  Half way there something made me turn around and return home. I don't know what this was but I  hope it doesn't happen again. I thought it would get better by now

7 months 7 days

 After 33 years of being a heavy smoker, most of the time was 2 packs a day with several years at 3 packs a day, I quit on May 7, 2014.
I wish I found this place when I quit. I had to do it on my own with no support. 
 But I did it and that's what counts.
 One of the things that helped me was convincing myself to hate the smell of cigarettes.  I know that I'll never pick that habit up again.

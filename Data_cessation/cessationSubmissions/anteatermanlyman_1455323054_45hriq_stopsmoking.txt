Thank you for being supportive. Also, I'm on the patch!

I've been browsing this subreddit for a while now. I've failed many times and I'm still trying :). Even after quitting in february and coming back in october, I'm still trying.

My doctor prescribed me a nicotine patch this week and I'm trying that now. It was pretty easy to get with good insurance, just have to ask for them. I've got three refills, 30 patches each. Hoping this gets me to stop bumming, which is my main problem. I've dropped to a cigarette a day, mostly from a habbit. It honestly is hard when it can be an excuse to chat.

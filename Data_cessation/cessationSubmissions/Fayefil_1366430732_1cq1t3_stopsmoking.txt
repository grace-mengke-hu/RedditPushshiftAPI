I'm having a hard time staying quit when my boyfriend smokes in front of me

I have asked him if there's any chance he could quit and he said, one thing at a time. He's pretty much quit drinking and has stopped smoking pot entirely. How can I encourage him to stop smoking cigarettes too? He's 31 and he's been smoking since he was 12. I'm worried about his health. He coughs like crazy in the morning. :( He only smokes outside on the porch but when I sit out there with him, I want one too.

I am so weak

I have been trying to go cold turkey...I swear I have. I clearly have no willpower though, as I have only gone 1 day without at least 1 smoke in the week since I decided to stop. The cravings are really crazy. Headaches, weird dreams, mood swings. I know most of it is only in my own head but I literally cannot make it through the day without a cig. I feel like a failure everytime I break down and smoke. I'm still making drastic improvements, 1 or 2 a day versus the whole pack I used to smoke, but the cravings are so hard to get through. HELP ME

Anyone else feel like being in this sub makes quitting more difficult?

I feel like I'm in a weird place where I want to think about how long I've not smoked and at the same time I don't want to think of cigarettes as it only makes me want to smoke. Similarly, I'm here to find help in quitting but it only makes me think of cigarettes. 

I am going crazy right this moment thinking of smoking. I need to Number 2 in the bathroom but I'm used to smoking in there while I do my business that I don't know what to do. Fuck man.

Hi, I finally quit smoking!

Hey guys, I finally quit smoking. At least I think so. I really don't wanna touch a cigarette ever again. 

My reason : I wanna deserve the girl I love. She lost her father to cancer due to smoking, and she _obviously_ hates it. And I don't want to ever do anything that she hates. I've tried quitting before, but always failed - as I didn't really have a reason for quitting. Maybe this'll finally work?

Wish me luck, guys! 

P.S. I chose today cause it's her birthday!

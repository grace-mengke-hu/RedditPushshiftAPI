Roughly 18 hours in and I am afraid to get out of bed

I can't seem to stop crying since waking up and I am so afraid of getting out of bed as I am worried that I will just get dressed and go to the store and buy another pack.  

Trying to stay focused on other things right now, which is kind of helping .

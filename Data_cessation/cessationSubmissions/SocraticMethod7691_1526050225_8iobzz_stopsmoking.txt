Want to quit smoking, really don't know how

I really want to quit smoking but am struggling with it. The funny bit is I can easily get myself to adopt other healthy habits, like exercising and eating clean, but just can't get myself to quit smoking. I've had severe depression for a good part of my life, and recently got a job after being unemployed for a while. My job is hectic and I work long hours, but I like it for the most part. 
I was never a particularly hard smoker, but was nevertheless addicted. And in the last month since I've resumed work, my smoking has increased as my work is very demanding. 

I'm thinking of quitting this weekend since I wouldn't be at work. But honestly not confident about it. I had one other serious quit attempt before some years back when I quit for a few months. 

Would really appreciate some guidance, and for all the ex-smokers, what has been your experience since you quit?

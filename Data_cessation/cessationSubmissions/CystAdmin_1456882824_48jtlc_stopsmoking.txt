What is the best way to quit smoking?

Hello, I have been having problems trying to quit smoking cigarettes. I don't want to try using a vape/e-cig since I feel like I might be trading one thing for another. So, what works the best? Patches, lozenges, nicotine gum? Any other suggestions that would be useful?? Any help is great help

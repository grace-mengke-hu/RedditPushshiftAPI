A year ago today, I smoked my last cigarette.

Today, I can't imagine ever smoking. 

Ii see people smoking in the streets and I feel for them, trying to avoid eye-contact as they shelter their precious smoke from the rain, or stand out in the blazing hot sun, remembering the shame of being an outcast.

For the first few months, I was angry at them for stinking up my air, but now I just feel pity for them because I know how hard it is to take the steps towards quitting, with everyone quacking on about how terribly difficult it all is and how hugely momentous the act of quitting is.

It is momentous, though. It is powerful and empowering. It will make your heart swell with pride. Maybe not today or tomorrow, but one day you will tell someone about your quit and you'll be proud :)

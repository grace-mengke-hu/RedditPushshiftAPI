Nicotine addiction is insidious.

Have a family member with practically no money.  Told me today he has another late unpaid parking fine that if left unpaid will result in (another) bench warrant.  Said he has been looking for work; said his SO is tapped out from supporting them both, and that luckily he doesn't need to buy cigarettes because his SO keeps him supplied with NRT.

I'm trying not to judge.  I am so glad to not be a slave anymore.

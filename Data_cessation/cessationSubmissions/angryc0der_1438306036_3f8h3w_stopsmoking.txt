Tomorrow is quit day. Was excited. Now freaking out. Any tips?

I've been on Chantix for 7 days, desire to smoke is subsiding.

Read Allen Carr's book. Really changed my perceptions and got me excited to be a non smoker rather than dread quitting. I know Carr doesn't recommend Chantix or other aids, but I started the pills before I read his book.

But now, with 5 or 6 hours left before bed, I am finding myself in a mild panic. Tomorrow is the day. I've been pumped the past few days to get started, but now that the hour is almost at hand, I am kinda freaking out.

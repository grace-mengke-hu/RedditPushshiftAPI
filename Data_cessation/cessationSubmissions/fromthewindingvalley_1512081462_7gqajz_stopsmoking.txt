Finally quit! Breathing question?

Hey all! I've been quit for 2/3 months and, honestly, I know this time I'm done for good.

I smoked for 6 years and bounced between vaping and smoking for 2.

Im working out now and happy I've stopped. Sadly, though, the fact that I spent so much time smoking is wreaking havoc on my health anxiety.

Ive now noticed this symptom a few times and I want to see if any of you have had the same experience?

Sometimes (not too often) when I breathe ill be done exhaling, but there will still be a breathing sound/breath coming out. When I inhale, the inverse happens the same way. It's more that I can feel it than hear it, but I can definitely feel and hear it. It's NOT a whistle like a wheeze, it's more like the air is still getting squeezed out and hasn't fully emptied yet. Like there's something blocking the air I guess?

Does this sound familiar?

Also, I know you're all going to say go to the doctor and I get that! I just have gone so much for random stuff I don't want to let anxiety rule my life and always go at the drop of a hat but, that being said, I do notice this physical sensation so it's not just in my head...

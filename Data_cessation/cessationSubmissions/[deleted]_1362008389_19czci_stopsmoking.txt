This is it for me

I'm done. I can't do it anymore. I quit for 6 months in 2011, and I felt so good. I have been training in martial arts since 2010, and when I started I had the intention to compete and make a career of it. Well, cigarettes have handily shattered any hope of giving my 110% in that regard. I am barely at 50% because my body just can't keep up with my will. On sunday, I did my first competition since 2011 and I was handily dispatched. I have so much personal shame, not because I lost, but because I lost without doing my best. The horrible endurance is only a part of it. When I wasn't smoking I would spend every moment I now spend puffing away doing something beneficial, either for my mind or my body. It destroys my mental state, and makes me feel helpless. When I wasn't smoking, I felt like I could do anything and nothing was in my way. Well, it's time to shatter these delusions I have that I can't do it. It's time to destroy the whisper that says having "Just one more" will ease my pain. I know that the cause of my pain is the cigarettes themselves, and not the withdrawal effects that come with giving them up. I am making a public oath that I will never smoke a cigarette again. "Never say never" be damned, it's over. I'm done.

Thanks for reading.

Long time smoker and quitter to the third degree.

This is my third time quitting. The first two times I've gone about 2 years without cigarettes. I never smoked much to begin with, roughly 3 a day on the low side and 6 on the high side. It was enough to make me feel ashamed about my habit. I've decided I'm done. I can't afford to be a smoker and I don't want to be the smoker in a relationship. I'm on day 2 and I've had a few strong cravings but they've passed. I loved smoking. The feel. The state of calm. I just realized I love my partner more and I want to spend more time with him. I also want to get in better shape and it was hard with shitty lungs. Wish me luck. I hope the third time is a charm.

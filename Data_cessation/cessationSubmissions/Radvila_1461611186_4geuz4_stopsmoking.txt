The first day

Hey fellas! I've just smoked my last cigarette with the help of Allen Carr and couldn't be more excited about finally stopping smoking after 6 years of this dread. I realise that there is a lot to overcome, but I finally feel prepared for everything the life has to throw at me and I am going to do it without a cigarette!

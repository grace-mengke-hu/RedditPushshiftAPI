What's your opinion on quitting cold turkey?

I was just about to post a long rant about all the mental blocks I have with quitting and this caused me to chain smoke the rest of my pack. Now I'm sitting here wondering if I have the ability to push all those excuses aside and go for it.

Any motivational thoughts or constructive criticism?

Started vaping after almost 4 years of smoking

After dozens of failed attempts to quit, I decided to use vape to break the habit and my tolerance for smoke.  It's been five days, absolutely no cravings, even an aversion is already growing in me for smoke, even for the smell of it. Definitely a step forward for me.

One week down!

I smoked for five years, and during the last year or so, I was smoking close to a pack a day. 

I quit cold turkey a week ago after a night of chain smoking. I felt so shitty when I woke up and began to really evaluate the effects that smoking has had on me physically and mentally. 

I've tried to quit a few times before, but this is the most success I've had with it. I really attribute a big part of my success to this sub. I've been reading your stories every time I have a craving, and it's really helped my motivation. 

Just wanted to say thank you to everyone here.

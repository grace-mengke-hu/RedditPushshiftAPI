Day 1 (Again!)

I'm restarting my quest to quit. In January I quit smoking cold turkey and went on for about 7 months without smoking! I was recently diagnosed with GAD and started taking Zoloft. Once the Zoloft started to kick in I noticed I was having cravings with greater frequency. Eventually I caved and started smoking again. The last time I saw my psychiatrist, she recommended that I try Wellbutrin (also called Zyban when marketed for smoking cessation) to help curb my smoking habit along with other negative side-effects of the Zoloft. I've been on Wellbutrin for a little over 2 weeks now and have made today my quit day! Wish me luck!!!

I can't stand the smell of smoke/cigarettes. What can I do?

Hi everyone!

First of all, english isn't my first language, so I am sorry for my grammar. Also sorry for the long post! I tried to keep it short :)

An introduction: I quitted smoking almost 5 months ago after 10 years smoking. I would say I smoked 10-14 cigarettes per day during my last years. Also I have to say my parents smoke a lot, A LOT. My father smokes 2+ packs per day (40+ cigarettes) and has been smoking for 40+ years. I live abroad and my husband doesn't smoke, so that helps a lot. Now I don't think of smoking, I don't have cravings. However it seems that the smell disgusts me more and more and I want to be far from it.

The situation: Today, one of my husband's coworkers came to visit and invited us tonight to grab a beer. Where I live there are bars for smokers and at least the guy who visits smokes. Since I can't stand the smell of cigarettes and I feel anxious been surrounded by smokers/smoke, I decided to stay at home. Maybe they end going to a non-smoking bar, I don't know. To be honest, I feel bad for staying at home.  

It is the first time I've been in this situation, because most of the time we stay at home playing video games, and if I "go out" it means drinking coffee and eating a slice of cake :) 

The thing is that I don't know how to explain to people that I am an ex-smoker and can't stand it. How can I overcome the anxiety that been surrounded by smokers/smoke gives me? How do you guys manage for example eating outside when it is warm if there are smokers? Any tips would be helpful! 

TL;DR: Quitted smoking 5 months ago after 10 years, hate the smell of smoke, and don't know how to handle smokers near me.

New Here...starting Chantix tomorrow...

I'm 51, I've been smoking since I was 14 or so. I'm an RN and stressed because, job.  I am ready to pull the trigger on this shit habit and am starting Chantix tomorrow.  

Any words of advice?  What did you do to de-stress?  To rehab your lungs?  To avoid the weight gain?

Thanks in advance!

Have you successfully quit?

I'm really serious this time about quitting cigarettes. I'd like to hear, if possible, from any former smokers, about how their quitting experience went. 

What am I in for as far as with drawals?

I've been in jail once for 3 days and I didn't have any withdrawals whatsoever, sure I wanted a cigarette but I didn't really care.

I'm going to go from about 16 cigarettes a day to 5 a day, starting tomorrow.

Any advice or tips or stories would help a lot.

Thanks

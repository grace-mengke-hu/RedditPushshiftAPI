TWO HUNDRED DAYS (in numbers: 200)

In retrospect: the first 3 weeks were very hard and I was easily stressed but now I'm getting more and more used to it.



In the last 6 month I got drunk several times and I didn't bum a cig.


Starting again would be stupid and I hope that I won't fool myself :)

I wish you all the very best to stop smoking.

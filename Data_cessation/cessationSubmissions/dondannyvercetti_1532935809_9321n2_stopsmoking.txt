Need help please!!

I started smoking 3 years ago. I've quit on and off, never going above 21 days, in my last attempt. After that, I need only half a cigarette and can ash it out after just 4 drags but I just keep on feeling the itch to go and light one. I really have to give it up now because it's high time. Please suggest anything!! I had one 20 mins ago and am not going to smoke one again. How to deal with the thoughts!? How to wake up in the morning without the first thing on your mind being a cigarette?

I made it 3 weeks!

It's been difficult but I made it this far! Every once in a while I get a really strong craving, usually after a meal or when I'm watching this show I've been watching, in which some of the main characters smoke regularly (I have since decided not to watch this show since it triggers bad cravings).

When the craving hit last night, rather than running to the store to buy a pack I woke my boyfriend up and he talked me through it. I think having someone to support you, especially if it's someone who's already gone through what you're going through, is a huge benefit when trying to stop smoking. 

Anyways just wanted to share my struggles so people know they're not alone. I can post on here about how much quitting sucks, but really it's hard to explain exactly how it feels. You guys probably know that though :) It sucks, but it's so worth it and in the long run you gotta just know that it'll suck less and less each day.

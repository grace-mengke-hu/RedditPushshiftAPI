I am tired of trying and I am tired of failing. What do I do?

Hey guys,
Sorry if this is sad post but I am tired of it, I feel like a pussy every time I pick it back up for not being able to stay true to quitting. I hate myself for when I am smoking cigarettes but I always find some way to make an excuse to smoke. I have been trying to quit for 2 years. I tried cold turkey, would go 2-3 weeks, then find some excuse to smoke again. I tried allen carrs book/video, went maybe a month or two and started back again. I am lost, right now, I am trying to ween myself off because one of my friends told me it worked for her. I don't know what else to do/how to find the motivation to stay strong. Any advice would help.
Thanks

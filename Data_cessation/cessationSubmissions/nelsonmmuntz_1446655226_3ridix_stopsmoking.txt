How's the whole quitting thing "working out"?

Long before I quit smoking, I took up running and other physical activities to help me get in shape. Running in particular is something that I really got into. I run several times a week, train for races; I really enjoy it. And for a long time I would get a kick out of how I was able to be a pack a day smoker but also accomplish some nice running feats - several half marathons, my first full marathon last year. I remember (half jokingly) wanting to carry smokes and a lighter with me so i could light up while crossing the finish line at the marathon!

Well, since quitting two months ago, I noticed a significant change (which I was expecting) in my breathing and pace. I'm comfortably running about 45-60 seconds more quickly for my mile pace. And I can just notice the good feeling of taking in deep breaths during my runs or cardio based and yoga classes. I still get breathless during workouts from time to time. But it's more of a "pushing myself really hard", good kind of breathless. And not a "it hurts my lungs to take in deep breaths" way, if that makes sense?

Anyway, any other former smokers or recent quitters that look to fitness as a tool to help motivate them?

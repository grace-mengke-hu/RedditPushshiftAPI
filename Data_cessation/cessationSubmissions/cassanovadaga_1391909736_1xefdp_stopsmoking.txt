Two weeks, cold turkey!

just decided that after eight (!!!!!) years, enough was enough. I couldn't even finish that last smoke, it'd already started to taste and feel terrible. I had tried to quit prior, but caved. Now I know I can't cave again. 

I can already feel the difference! Any time I crave one, I drink a full glass or bottle of water and take a deep breath. Because it feels good to do so now.

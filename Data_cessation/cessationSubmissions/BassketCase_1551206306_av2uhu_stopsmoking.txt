Would this be a good approach? I'll stop buying packs again but whenever someone offers me a cig, I'll take it. I will never smoke alone, only socially.

Or is it better to quit completely? I think it's harder to quit completely, and it would be easier to just avoid buying cigarettes again and only smoke with other people, when they offer me one. It's hard to refuse a cig at work, whenever everyone else is outside and smoking.

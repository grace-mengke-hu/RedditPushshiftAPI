Day 2

Haven't smoked or chewed for the past two days. While I was at the bar tonight, I really thought about going with my roommate to have a cigarette (he would easily give me one).  I just thought "well, maybe I'll just wait till he comes back" or "There's really no good reason to go have a cigarette right now." Plus, the idea of having one kind of turned me off. And like Lil Wayne says, "turn down for what?"

Watched a guy hot box two cigs outside of the hotel in Chicago today - wind chill was 10 degrees - he looked miserable and I don’t miss it!!!

Watching this guy smoke made me realize and remember how much I really hated smoking.  He was out there alternating smoking and covering his cold ears with the other hand.  Honestly he looked unhappy and depressed but had to get those “two in” before he could start his day.   Don’t focus on the few smokes we enjoyed, focus on the 80% that we smoked just because we were so addicted.  Ohhhh the new found freedom!!!!!  Stay strong my friends, stay strong!!!

My digestive system became too reliant on nicotine. How am I ever going to quit?

I've tried to quit cigarettes a year ago but gave up after 5 days. Why? constipation. With the cravings I could deal with (even though they were messing messing with my mind something fierce) but not with the constipation. The 5 days I didn't smoke I didn't go number two once. Then I started thinking "isn't being constipated for so long even *more* unhealthy than smoking? if I don't smoke, who knows when I'll stop being constipated? I might need an enema, and I *really* don't want to experience that". So I lit one up. Sure enough, I was barely through half my cigarette and the need to relieve myself became overwheling. How would I avoid that the next time I decide to quit?

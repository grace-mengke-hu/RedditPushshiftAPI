Coming to you from 4 years in the future

Hi friends,

I'm not a regular here, though I have browsed this sub in the past, and I consider you my people, and you all have my respect and compassion. I quit smoking cold turkey 4 years ago today. I quit right before my 27th birthday, after smoking about half a pack a day for 10 years. I loved and hated smoking. I'd tried to quit using nicotine gum a few times but always backslid. When I finally did it, I had the advantage of moving across the country and away from my old habits and triggers. That helped immensely. 

Quitting has made my life so much better. I'm no longer shackled to an addiction. Once my mom asked what the hardest part was and I said "the first six months." There was a time when I felt I would always have this addiction haunting me and that I'd never be able to quit. I can't believe it's been four years. 

This may be the hardest thing you'll ever do, but it is SO worth it. If you can white\-knuckle your way through those first few days, weeks and months, you'll be rewarded with a sense of smell \(!!\) and a sense of freedom you can only imagine now. If you fall off the wagon, get back on! Good luck everyone! Feel free to message me if you want to talk.

I want to quit smoking hookah any advice?

I used to occasionally smoke hookah - maybe once twice a week but now I do it every day after work. It just helps me unwind.

I want to quit it now.

The problem is when I get home I just start getting antsy and craving a shisha. I used to spend my evenings playing the xbox but with kids and the wife nagging me to get off the xbox I don't have that desire to play anymore even though I have the newest games.

I just don't have anything to replace my evenings with to get my mind off the hookah. It's something I look forward to. Sitting at a shisha lounge and watching a movie. The taste doesn't even matter any more regardless of how it tastes.

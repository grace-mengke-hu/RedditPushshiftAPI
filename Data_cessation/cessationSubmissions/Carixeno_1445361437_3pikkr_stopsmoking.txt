Mind Games

It's officially been a week that I havn't smoked. I'm so proud of myself and loved ones around me have told me the same. I don't crave it however my mind tries to play games with me. I'll be in the middle of whatever I'm doing and my mind will sneak in a thought such as "you should have one. It's not like one will do anything" When I know for a fact just one will ruin everything. I know the only thing I can do is just wait it out and tell myself that I'm too good for this toxic crap. I have to get the thoughts out of my head whenever I wake up that there will be no smoke with my morning coffee, no smoke before work, nor after work. There will be no smoke ever again.

Hope everyone is having a wonderful day and stay strong!!! :)

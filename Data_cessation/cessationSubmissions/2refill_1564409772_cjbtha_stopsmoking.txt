Third time trying to quit. Day 1 today.

Hi folks. I wanted to quit with my other friend who smokes but he’s not ready yet, but I am.

I don’t even smoke that much, ~5 cigs every weekday, 2 packs over the weekend. Been like this for about 4 years. 

I’m just scared if I don’t stop now, I’ll keep this up till I’m 40+ (I’m 28 now). Been browsing this sub the last couple of days and am sufficiently encouraged to give this another proper shot. My previous high score is 4 days, but let me get to Day 2 first :)

Any good apps or articles are always appreciated and just want to thank everyone on this sub, yall were the push I needed to begin this journey again.

Day 20 - can't imagine that I used to smoke

It's weird. I didn't have any cravings in the past days, and I find myself disgusted by the idea that I smoked.

I am not naive and I will remember to stay vigilant - that is, for the rest of my life - but still I am happy to find myself not suffering from this addiction, at least not now.

If the cravings come back, well, let them come. It would still be worth the suffering. Easily, there are SO many benefits of not smoking! There are improvements in about every area of my life, some tiny, some huge.

So, I encourage anyone reading this to continue (or start). This too shall pass!

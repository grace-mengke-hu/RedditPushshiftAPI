Box breathing has been a game changer for me

I quit tobacco a few months ago using the patch. The patch really helped me keep sane while breaking the seemingly hundreds of nicotine “rituals” I made.

I feel almost no nicotine cravings compared to when I started. However, event based anxiety had really gotten ahold of me. Little things in life seemed to stack up — family, job, social interactions. Previously, nicotine really helped me face these events. It provided me with a little “oasis of chill” whenever I needed it. It was a small predictable way to achieve sanity. 

Without it, anxiety in my life had really started to build up. A social anxiety I hadn’t experienced since high school reared its head. Traffic felt like it was taking years off of my heart’s lifespan. I was very quick to be angry and very quick to be embarrassed. I felt like I needed to get anxiety meds to be honest. 

Then I discovered box breathing. It has been the most radically life altering discovery since I began smoking a decade ago. It’s simple: breath in for four seconds, hold for four seconds, breathe out for four seconds, abstain from breathing in for four seconds, repeat. I imagine a steady “tracing” of a box in my head while doing it.

I’m not joking. It achieves the same exact “oasis of chill” nicotine used to bring. It feels like an easy to administer “dose” just like cigarettes used to be. Hell, sometimes I’ll even go outside to do it. In moments when I’d usually chain smoke, I chain box breathe. It’s filled what feels to be the last void in my quitting journey.

Thought I’d share. Try it out.

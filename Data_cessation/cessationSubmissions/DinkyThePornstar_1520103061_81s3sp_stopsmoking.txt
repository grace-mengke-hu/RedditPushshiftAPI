It's been one week

I have smoked about a pack a day for years now. I recently got extremely sick and had to go to a doctor. he said (the gist of it) "This is what the common cold will be like for you from now on, since you're a smoker."

I tossed my pack out on Monday. The first few days weren't too bad, because I was sleeping for the most part, still trying to shake that cold. Now, I'm told that I should have cleared my system of nicotine by now, and all that's left are the habitual cravings. Please help me, I allowed smoking to be such a casual thing that I did it when practicing bass, i did it between games, I did it to take a break from drawing and other creative practices... What can I do to break the habit fully?

I've heard that replacing the habit with another habit helps. Any suggestions? I'm open to literally anything. What can I do, what can I focus on, and how can I avoid triggers when I did it before/between/after just about every recreational thing I did?

Thanks so much for any help and support.

I just flushed 65 smoke-free days down the toilet

During that time, I never once stopped missing it. I think what's giving me the most trouble is that I didn't quit for myself. Future health problems, expense, etc didn't play a role in the decision; social stigma and convenience did. Because quitting feels like an obligation imposed on me by others, I resent it. At the same time, I'm aware that my junkie brain is doing the talking. Ugh.

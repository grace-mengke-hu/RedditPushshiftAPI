As of today, I've been smoke free for 5 months. I never thought this day would come. Thanks to Allen Carr's book.

Today has been a pretty shitty day, but I just walked past my calendar and saw today marks 5 months since I quit smoking. I'm very proud of myself and very happy I made it.

I wish all of you who are quitting, strengh in walking this path. Life is so much beter when you are free from nicotine.

"How I did it" from an almost 15-year quitter

Hi everyone.  Looking at my flair, it's hard to believe that I used to count the days.....and now it's almost 5500??!!  Is that really possible?  Well, yes it is.  I don't count the days anymore....I really only think about and commemorate each passing anniversary of my quit date, that's all that left of the demon.  Here's how I found success after many failures:  

On July 28, 1999, I smoked my last cigarette.  I couldn't have known at the time it was truly my last cigarette because I had tried and failed many times to quit (which is key!!  don't quit trying to quit).  On the morning of July 29, of that year, I took on a new and different approach to quitting.  **I had one simple rule that I promised myself I would abide by:  at any point that I felt I was about to give in and smoke a cigarette, I would stop and take a quick dip in the pool.**  

This may seem ineffective on the surface, but it worked.  I think it worked for two reasons.  One, getting in the pool got me wet (obvious, I know) and being wet adds just one tiny obstacle to smoking a cigarette.  Having to dry one's hands to get the cig out of the box and strike the lighter gives one just a little bit more time to reconsider.  Two, being in the water is relaxing and helps to get past the craving.  

If you don't have a pool, you can probably substitute with a nice warm shower or bath.  

That's how I did it.  I hope you all find success.  To this day, I still count quitting smoking cigarettes among my life's most rewarding achievements....right up there with graduating from college and having kids.  Eventually, you stop counting the days and you wake up one day realizing you've completely exorcised the demon.  It's wonderful.  DO IT!!!  You can do it!!

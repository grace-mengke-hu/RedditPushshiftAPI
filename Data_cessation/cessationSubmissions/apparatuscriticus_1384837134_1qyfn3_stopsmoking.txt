A milestone

If you had told me 6 months ago that today I would be 6 months smoke free I would have cried. I would have told you that you were probably wrong. I would have told you that I had tried to quit many, many times before.

I can breathe so much better now. I am so grateful for that and so many other positive aspects of not being a smoker any longer.

It seems impossible but it isn't. It's just really hard and as human beings, hard is in our ballpark.

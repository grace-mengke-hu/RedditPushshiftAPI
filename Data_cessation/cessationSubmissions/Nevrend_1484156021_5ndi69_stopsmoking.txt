Breathing techqniques

Smoked for 20 years and quit cold turkey about 8 days ago. I feel like the worst of it is over as far as withdrawal symptoms. One thing i'm finding odd however is that although my lungs and throat feel much better overall, the timing / rhythm of my breathing seems off. I talk to people on the phone all day and this is really throwing me off my game. I read something online about how smoking forces you to breathe a certain way and when you quit this technique of breathing is gone too unless you force yourself to do it. Something about inhaling, holding your breath for a few seconds, exhaling, sort of like when your taking a drag from a cigarette. Has anyone done this with success? Would something like Yoga that trains rhythmic breathing help? Any success stories or tips in this matter are welcome. Thanks!

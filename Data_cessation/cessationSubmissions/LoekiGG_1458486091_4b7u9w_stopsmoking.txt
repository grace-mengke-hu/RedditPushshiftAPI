I don't look forward to the weekends anymore.

Hey! My name is Mick and I am 22yo. I've smoked my last cigarette about 11 days ago, after 6 years of smoking one pack a day.

Going through life without smoking is getting easier every day. BUT I figured that I don't look forward to the weekends anymore, since I quit. Because I have to face my friends enjoying a cigarrete every damn weekend.. while I'm not able to light one up!

Besides, I haven't been sleeping very well lately. Because (this may sound really weird), I have been dreaming about smoking the last 3 nights.



These things are really messing with me right now. Does anyone recognise what I'm feeling?




Any advice is very welcome.

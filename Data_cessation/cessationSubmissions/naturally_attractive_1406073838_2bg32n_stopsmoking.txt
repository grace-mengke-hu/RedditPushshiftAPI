just joined. what is/was your best method of quitting? cold turkey, patches, gum, toothpicks etc?

I'm really trying to find a cost effective method of quitting for good. I don't think cold turkey would work for me because I work with smokers, live with smokers, and pretty much live in a sea of ashtrays and empty packs. so how did you do it? what has worked for you guys? Sorry if this question is oft-posted but i couldn't find a FAQ or anything.

My story...

Here is some background information about myself. I am 25 years old, just finished up my 4 year degree, and currently work full time at a resort. I have been smoking for 10 years. When I started smoking, I always told myself it was something I could quit any time and it has been something I tried quitting many times. I tried quitting so much that I became *the boy who cried quit*. Every time I quit in the past I would tell friends about my quitting and they would just laugh about it and hand me a cigarette. I tried everything in my past attempts to quit smoking. I tried patches, gums, candy, dip, pouches, electric cigarettes, hypnotherapy, and read and watched many books and movies about quitting...including Allen Carr's Easyway to Stop Smoking. I even tried using this subreddit in the past as a way of a support group to quit. After numerous attempts I realized many things that I was doing wrong. I wasn't quitting for **myself**. I told myself that I was quitting for myself but deep down I wasn't. I always wanted to quit because I wanted people including myself to think I could do it or because I liked the quick attention I got when I told people I wasn't smoking anymore. But like I said before, after you tell that same person that you quit for the 100th time, you lose that attention and it becomes a joke. Well the time came when I realized that I had to come face to face with myself and told myself to stop being a punk about the situation and get it done. So that's exactly what I did. I threw away my pack and stopped smoking. The first few days were torture... it always is. But you just have to keep telling yourself to not be a bitch about it and get it done. Once you get past the torment of your cravings, you won't have to go through it again. I started exercising every day. This does wonders for my self-esteem and kills any cravings I might have for nicotine. If you recently quit or want to quit, try running a few miles before resorting to a cigarette. I also changed the way I ate. I would eat out for every meal and I usually ate pure junk. Now I just buy my groceries and cook. By doing this and quitting cigarettes, I save a lot of money. I eat a lot of fruit and veggies. I basically created a wall of exercise and healthy eating that keeps any thoughts of cigarettes out of my mind. My way to look at this would be  to compare it to cleaning your brand new car everyday. Would you want to drive that car through a muddy dirt road (by smoking) or take the paved street and keep your car clean. It's late and I work the graveyard shift and that sounds like good comparison at this time. Also, while doing a security patrol at the resort I work at I ran into a almost-full pack of cigarettes laying on a beach chair with a lighter next to the pack. I wanted to grab one and just spark it up. Did I do it?...hell the fuck no. From all the times I quit in the past, I realized that I made the same mistake every time. I lit up a cigarette thinking I was over it and couldn't be hooked again. That's the problem with smokers. They think that it is impossible to be dumb enough to get hooked on cigarettes again, so they put everything on the line and pick up that one cigarette again to prove a useless point. One cigarette is all it takes... seriously just one. Don't be that fish that continues to be tricked into taking the bait. Be a smart fish and walk (or should I say swim) away and find something real, something that gives you a natural boost in life, like exercising or another hobby. I can go on and on about this and I am probably boring you to death but I just want to at least help one person out. One last thing I want to say is that counting how many days it been since I last smoked was not a good idea. I don't know why, but I feel that counting the days just makes the whole thing bigger then it really is. I like to forget about the whole thing and just say "yeah I used to smoke, but I gave it up sometime ago". Knowing the exact date and time just keeps it on your mind all the time. It also helps not telling many people about it. Like before, I don't know why but it works for me. Anyways, good luck to everybody who has quit, is quitting, or is just thinking about quitting and remember **"Don't be a bitch about it, and get it done."**

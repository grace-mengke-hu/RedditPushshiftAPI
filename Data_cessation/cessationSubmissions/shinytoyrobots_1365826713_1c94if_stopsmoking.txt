First time in a bar since I quit, went OK!

Had been dreading this as a potential slip up opportunity. 12 days in, first trip to a bar.

Went really OK. Only thing I did different (except not smoke!) was order a screwdriver instead of a beer...because I never liked the combination of smoke and orange juice even when I was a smoker.

Another landmark for me. My friends who are still smokers were very respectful when I told them I'd quit, made sure that someone always stayed inside to keep me company when the others smoked, so I wasn't tempted to follow them outside. :)

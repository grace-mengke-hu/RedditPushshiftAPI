Have a fat kid party.

I have been tobacco free since September 15th. However, I started getting cocky this past month, bumming one or two from a relative or friend when I felt like it.

I also have issues with depression--much less than in the past when I've been suicidal and perpetually irritable, but it's still there, and has been a factor in why it was difficult for me to quit for five years (living in Asia, where cigarettes are cheap and ubiquitous, was the other one).

Last week at about 2 a.m., I was thinking about an ex, going through a tough time at work, not sleeping well, and worrying about money. I realized a) the craving I'd earned from cheating was hitting its peak and b) I was about to go out and buy a pack of American Spirits, because my brain was screaming for a dopamine rush from something, anything. 

So I went to the all night gas station, and bought...

...a pint of Turkey Hill ice cream, a pint of Ben and Jerry's, a bag of tortilla chips, a jar of salsa con queso, a package of gummy worms, and a package of ramen. Then I went home, and had myself a fat kid party. 

Now my pants are a little tighter than before, but I'm still tobacco free, haven't cheated since then, and I'm proud of myself.

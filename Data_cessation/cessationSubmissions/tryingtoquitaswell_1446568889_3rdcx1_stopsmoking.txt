Do the withdrawal symptoms go away?

Okay quick backstory. I'm 22 now and first smoked when I was 18. I didn't really enjoy it and only did it when I was constantly pressured to. I think up til 21 I smoked less than 10 cigs. Fastforward to 4 months back I started working and many people here smoke and I ended up buying my own packs as well.

2 days ago on Sunday morning I had to run to catch the bus and felt breathless when it was such a short distance. I made the decision then to quit and felt much better about it. Today, during lunch, one of my co workers asked me along for a smoke break and I said that I quit. It was only at that moment when I realised that i gave it up forever that it hit me and I suddenly craved sooooo badly for one. The good news is that I managed to fight off the temptation to smoke but unfortunately I've been experiencing withdrawal symptoms and it isn't going away.

I've got this sickening feeling in my stomach now. Will these feelings go away or do you just get better at handling it?

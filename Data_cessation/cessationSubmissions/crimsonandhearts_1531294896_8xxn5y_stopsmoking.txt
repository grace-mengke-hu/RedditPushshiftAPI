Chantix - ending day 9.

I’m at the end of Day 2 of the full dose (1mg in the morning, 1mg in the evening) and the difference in 2 days and dosages is crazy. I bought a pack yesterday morning (7/9) and I still have about 4-5 left, which I don’t think I’m going to smoke. I went to my boyfriends house around 4, and decided to leave my pack at home. Which was surprisingly an easy decision. He does smoke but only about 5 a day, so when he went out, I had three or four puffs of his and couldn’t do it. 

I actually think I can do this. I never thought I’d be able to quit. But now I feel like I can do it. 
Side effect report - nothing new. Haven’t lost my mind or anything. The only thing is the trouble sleeping, which is annoying but a smoke free life is worth a little while of sleep troubles. I’m going to see how tomorrow goes with no cigarettes. 
Thanks for listening to all of my updates. Hopefully this helps someone. :)

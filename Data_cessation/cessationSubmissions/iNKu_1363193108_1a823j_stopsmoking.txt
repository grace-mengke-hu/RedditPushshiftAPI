Third day in...I'm trying to rationalize that Nicotine is not that bad for me, and i can quit cigarettes but not e-cigs.

SO this is my second attempt to quit, but this time I went cold turkey. I'm on my third day today (despite what the badge says) and i caught myself googling "How bad is nicotine for you" I guess i'm trying to rationalize a way for me to smoke my e-cigs. (I have a lot of e-cigs from my previous quit attempt)

How bad is nicotine for you anyways? Is it true that it's no worse than caffeine? Are e-cigs considered cheating?

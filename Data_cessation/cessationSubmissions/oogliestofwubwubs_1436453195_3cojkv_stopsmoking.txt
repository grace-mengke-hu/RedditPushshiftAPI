You'd think I'd be over it by now

52 days.  All I can think about is a cigarette at the moment.  Thinking about how it would feel to inhale, feel it on my throat, in my lungs. Exhaling.

You'd think I'd be over it by now, wouldn't you?  I know my body is over it. My mind is most days but today, for some reason, I desperately want to smoke.

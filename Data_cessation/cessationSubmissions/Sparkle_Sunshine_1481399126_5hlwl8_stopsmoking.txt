Bought a pack after 4 months :(

I hit my 4 month mark about a week ago, I was doing great ! Felt so much better and was so proud of myself. About a month ago I found out my father has Lymphoma. My boyfriend is currently not working due to depression, so I am unable to take the time I would like off to be there for my father and I feel awful about it. I finally broke down and bought a pack this.morning and had one on the drive home. Feeling terrible about it ! 

Thanks all

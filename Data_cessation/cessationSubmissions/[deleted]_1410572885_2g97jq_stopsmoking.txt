Down to one cigarette... and I'm off to sleep to wake up to a brand new day of no smoking

I'm going to make this my last cigarette.  I feel pretty apprehensive, but after reading so many posts in this subreddit, and thinking how much I have wanted to quit over the last several months, I feel it is time to join in on the no smoking party.

I have added the Cessation Nation application on my android, so I will be monitoring and keeping track of my cravings.  

Help me start off with some encouragement for the morning.  My routine is to wake up at 7 AM, and head to work.  I generally have a cigarette, a coffee, something to eat, and then off to work I go for 8:30.  I think I can do without a coffee, but I'm not too sure smoking and coffee are intrinsically linked for me.

Wish me luck, guys and gals.

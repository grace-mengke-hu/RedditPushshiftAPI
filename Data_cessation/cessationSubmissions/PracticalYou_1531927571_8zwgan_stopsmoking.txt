Day 1

Today is my first day and I’m feeling pretty good although my triggers are when I leave work and need to decompress. Anxiety tends to get high at that point, but I’m going to listen to advice and go for a long walk, take some deep breaths, and remember I have anxiety because I smoked, and not because I am not smoking.
I always say “I wish I was 3 months out!” but I am learning (esp from this forum) that its day to day/ minute to minute/ moment to moment thing for now!
Can’t wait for this to be a dark chapter of my past-one I intend of never returning to!

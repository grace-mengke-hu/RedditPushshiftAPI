Really looking to drop this horrible habit, just looking for ways to tell myself I don't need one.

So, I am really beginning to see the affects of cigarettes and the money I spend and I just need to stop. My dad died of cancer a few years back and while it didn't come from cigarettes, it's just so hard to think about when my mom found out that I smoke. After everything we went through with him, the look of disappointment was just so hard to bare. I work for a local grocery store, as a produce manager, and the freedom that is granted at a work place like that allows for me to take a quick smoke break almost every hour \(I don't take the 2 15 ones that are provided\), and my colleagues \(and people who work under me\) have noticed how often I just go missing. I enjoy my work and I like to think that I'm fairly good at it. I can go a few hours some days at work without one... I'm just trying to figure out, how to stop myself from thinking about it? Or at the very least when i do start to crave one, what can I tell myself, or what can I do to just avoid the thoughts? Sorry, my thoughts are kind of all over the place, I'm kinda anxious thinking about quitting, but I am excited, and I want to begin the process, I just recently thought that hey, maybe Reddit can help me. I've told myself that i was quitting before and it never lasted more than a day or two, I'm just looking for some anecdotal advice that I can take to heart and try, to help me quit, I'll try anything that has worked for other people. I just know that the sooner I tell myself I can start this process the sooner I can quit.

Day 3: I think everyone can relate

Decided to post everyday for awhile, helps keep me accountable. Its awesome not wanting to purchase cigarettes, honestly that thought does not go through my head. It's more of a wow this sucks or I feel pretty crazy right now, but I’m so glad I’m doing this. The mental change has been what's different for me this time around. And of course you fellow redditors, you all are awesome and thank you for the support. Onward, to the light at the end of the tunnel!

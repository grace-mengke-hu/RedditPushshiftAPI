105 days:) but I have over the past few weeks started to develop a bad sugar habbit

hey there

I have been quit 105 days :) I have never had a sweet tooth before but over the past 3 weeks or so I have developed a real bad sugar habbit,  anyone one had a similar experience ? did it it pass or was it something that had to be dealt with, I dont want to replace one addiction for another.

thanks

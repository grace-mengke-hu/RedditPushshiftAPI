Need some moral support please.

Hi. Have stopped more times (and started again) than I can remember. Latest quit was 11 days and I caved yesterday, no idea why. Am sick of quitting and then hearing the "I'll have just one" voice. You'd think after all the failed attempts I would be wise to it by now. Need somewhere to go when I am feeling like giving in so folks can keep me on the straight and narrow!

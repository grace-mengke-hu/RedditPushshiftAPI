Dear cigarettes, I hate you. I love you. I hate you.

Hi reddit people!  I am an addict.  a bad one.  I smoke a lot.  I've read Sir Allen Carr's easy way to stop smoking book and quit for over 72 hours (which is HUGE for me), then broke the NOPE (not one puff ever rule), paired with an excuse that I was stressed and "deserved a cigarette.  I've seen tried his method over and over and over, and here I am a month later, still a smoker.  I've done a lot of research about addiction, the neurochemical changes, read a lot about quitting, read a lot about all sorts of things.  I've been meditating and practicing mindfulness, and what is so frustrating is that even being mindful of how cigarettes do NOTHING for me, I just haven't stopped!  I watched a ted talk about discovering what psychological need is fulfilled through cigarettes, and for me, it's control.  Even though I've identified it, still here I am.  I've decided that maybe Allen Carr's way, though amazing and helpful for a lot of people, maybe the cold turkey method is not for me.  I'm attempting to interchangably vape between cigarettes, and as I vape, I just want to smoke.  I hate smoking.  I love smoking.  It's killing me, yet my life is filled with it.  I'm so disappointed in myself for having given up a lot of unhealthy habits in the past, and being a trooper and making many accomplishements.  Any words of wisdom/advice would be so helpful!  
one of my major barriers is the morning!  I chain smoke every morning.  It is the hardest part of my day.  It's an excuse to take a break/concentrate/have peace/xyz all the things that my logical brain knows are simply not true!
Please HALP!  if there are any quitters who quit with vaping, can you tell me how you're doing?  ANy other advice and wisdom is welcome and surely appreciate!  F*CK SMOKING!!!!!!! BLARG!

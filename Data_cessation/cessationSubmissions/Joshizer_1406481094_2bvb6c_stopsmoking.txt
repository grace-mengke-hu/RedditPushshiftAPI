Had to have a knee surgery last week. Stopped smoking the same day

So I had to have a knee surgery on Wednesday afternoon, and I haven't smoked a cigarette since then. I decided if I can go on this long without smoking I might as well keep going. I don't think I had cravings because I'm on heavy painkillers for my knee. I'm scared once I'm healed up from the surgery and I don't have to take pain killers anymore my cravings would return. Is that how it works? What should I do to continue not smoking? 
I have been a light smoker for 8 years now

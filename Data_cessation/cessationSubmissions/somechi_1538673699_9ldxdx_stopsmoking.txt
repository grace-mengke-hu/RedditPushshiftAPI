Want to quit - best phone app to trace my progress, with support of nicorette gums?

Hi, I want to quit smoking after 13 years. I smoke about a pack a day. Even bought 100 nicorette gums some months ago, but instead of using them to replace cigarettes, I used them when I couldn't smoke (example in plane, restaurants, work sometimes).

Now I decided I want to stop smoking, and for start to just use chewing gums. Then slowly stop using gums also.

I like statistics, I like to track my progress in phone apps, so I am wondering if anyone can tell me some good "quit smoking" phone app, but with use of nicorette gums? 

As I will still have nicotine in my system (from gums), having an app which is designed for complete stoppage of smoking is not going to work for me because statistics will be unreliable. 

If something like that does not exist, can you just tell me which app you are using in general? It can be free or paid, I don't care. 

Thank you guys

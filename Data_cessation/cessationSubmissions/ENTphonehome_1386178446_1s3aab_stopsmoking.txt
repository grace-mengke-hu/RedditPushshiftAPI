Couldn't have done it with out you guys!

Day 16 and feeling strong. Just wanted to say you guys are great! I've been a lurker for some time now and this sub is the only place I really feel comfortable posting.
Also my SO is very supportive. She bought me candy for my cravings and cheered me on the whole time. 

I am very thankful for her and you guys.

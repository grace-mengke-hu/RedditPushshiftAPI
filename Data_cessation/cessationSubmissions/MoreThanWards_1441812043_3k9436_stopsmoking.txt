1 Month, and it's been a hell of a ride

Well, I quit a month ago. Not sure what my badge says, but the 9th of August was my last cigarette.

On the 12th I found a hard bump on my right testicle, and by last Wednesday Sept 2nd, I was having my right testicle removed. I haven't got the pathology back on the tumor yet, but I suspect it is cancerous (95% of all tumors in the testicular region are). Leave it to me to smoke a pack a day for 20 years and then get a rare type of cancer that has nothing to do with smoking!

Fortunately, testicular cancer is very curable, and after a tense time following a CT scan and a chest x-ray, it was determined that nothing has spread. The most likely scenario for me is watchful waiting, where I get a lot of bloodwork done and occasional CT scans.

But...I did. not. smoke. Through any of this! Most of you cannot imagine the stress and tension I have been under. For the few that can, I'm sorry that you can. But I didn't smoke, because doing so would have changed absolutely nothing, except to take me from a non-smoker back to a smoker. Has it been tough? I guess, at times, yeah. But all things concerned I'm so happy to be free, to not be a drug addict anymore, that the difficulty barely registers.

If I can do it under these circumstances, you can do it. You can do it. Never doubt it.

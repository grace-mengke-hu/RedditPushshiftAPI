Five days of not smoking has turned me into a liar, a binge eater and a "horndog"...

I've spent the last hour trying to convince myself that after five days of being a "non-smoker" I could probably buy a pack and then only have one a night... it seems like bullshit - but I was pretty persuasive....

I didn't give in, but it seemed to make a lot of sense there for a little while.

So that's the liar part... 

Today I must have eaten 12,000 calories:

* Breakfast

* Snack
* Lunch
* Snack
* Dinner
* Snack
* Snack

It's 9:00 and it's taking all of my willpower not to go and get a two person sushi platter from the place across the street. Normally sushi isn't such a bad choice, but I had a 5 Guys burger &amp; fries about two hours ago..

That's the binge eater part...

I'd talk about the whole "horndog" thing, but that seems like a lot of information.

Anyway - not a lot of point or purpose to this post - but I had to do something to keep me from smoking, eating and... well - you know....

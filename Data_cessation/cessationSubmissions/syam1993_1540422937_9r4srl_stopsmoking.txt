When do nicotine withdrawal effects really stop? (Hookah addict)

Hi everyone, 

I [25M] quit smoking hookah 17 days ago. I used to smoke an average of 1-2 hours every night for the past 18 months. I have been smoking hookah since I was 14. It was mostly occasional, like on the weekends and at parties. However, I became truly addicted after graduating (early 2017). Hookah has become associated with browsing the net, reading, watching Netflix, hanging out, and even playing video games. 

I am feeling depressed at work everyday, barely feeling like doing anything. I feel a heavy emotional load in my chest, and my brain keeps thinking of negative thoughts about everything, from family, to friends, to work. The idea of smoking comes to my mind like 10 times a day, most of them after work becuase that's when I usually smoke. 

Are these feelings typical of a nicotine-addict who quit smoking for more than two weeks? When do they usually stop? I really am tired of having them. 

Note: I started exercising yesterday hoping that would help.

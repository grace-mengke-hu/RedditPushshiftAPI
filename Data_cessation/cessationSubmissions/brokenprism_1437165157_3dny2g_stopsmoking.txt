Story Time: These last five days, on the road for work.

So, As I've stated before, I get to work from home about 50% of my time. So I started my not smoking journey when I knew I had a good block of time to just stay at home and not leave the house. I am the Northeast Sales Manager for my company but live within a mile of the main office in Dallas. 

Well 5 days ago I had to go visit my region, particularly Chicago. Traveling is my number one trigger for smoking. I would smoke before going through security, Smoke again when i land while i wait for luggage, Smoke after i got my luggage, Smoke when i got my rental car, smoke when i got to the hotel, NEVER get a smoking room. But I would walk out a couple time a night to smoke. then driving to meetings i would smoke on the way there and smoke on the way back. Smoking while driving got to be about 1 cig every 5 miles.

These last 5 days I have successfully avoided smoking. But its crazy how the elevator reeks from people using after smoking in there room. The people smoking in front of the airport are the worst. They are little beacons of "one free cig" all you gotta do is ask. People are so nice, they'll feel honored to let you bum one, and when they lend you a lighter they'll make the same joke "need to borrow some lungs too". 

TL;DR NOT THIS TIME SATAN. I got in and out of the airport, got my rental car, drove over 300 miles. All without a smoke.

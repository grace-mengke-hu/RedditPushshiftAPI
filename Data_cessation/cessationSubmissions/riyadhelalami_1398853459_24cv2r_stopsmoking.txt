It has been four months now, but now for the first time since I quite, I really want a cigarette.

Every time I see someone smoking I look at him, and wish I could take that smoke out of my lungs. I am really thinking now about ecigs but with no nicotine. Just because of the smoke I really love it.

I know I am getting weaker but why I had no problems tell now.

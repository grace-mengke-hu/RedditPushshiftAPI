Rage

Two of the six guys I work with have been smoking inside the shop. Another two are dippers. One is using a ridiculous hookah pen. Between that, stupid mistakes, and a high priority order, today has been an angry one. Plus I KNOW someone is going to break something today. I can feel it. There's no point is asking any of them not too, because it's established behavior. I just needed to vent a little.

Netflix Movie Brings Back Memories of Smoking

I'm watching a movie right now and the setting is in San Francisco. I lived in SF for around 4 years and smoked a lot especially when I went out to bars. Anyway, I had to pause the movie because I started getting overwhelmed by the nostalgia it gave me. It reminded me of the fun times I had in the city but the problem is, each day I spent in the city is associated with my smoking days. I'm sad that the joy I felt in the city depended on smoking and if I were to go back, I wouldn't feel the same way about the city anymore because I had stopped smoking. I quit in December 2017 and I don't want to be smoke ever again.

Breaking the habit with the patch

My god I have to use something I used to smoke 1 pack to 1-1/2 a day. I'm a construction worker so I'm outside all day and free to smoke we're re and whenever I want. Needless to say everything I do now seems to be a trigger. It's been three days on the patch and not one cigarette, it's amazing how quickly you can Feel the changes of not poisoning yourself, it's great! 


My patch came off in the pool Yesterday with out me realizing it and holy hell was I ever grumpy but still resisted a cigarette. 

Not really a point to this post just venting a little

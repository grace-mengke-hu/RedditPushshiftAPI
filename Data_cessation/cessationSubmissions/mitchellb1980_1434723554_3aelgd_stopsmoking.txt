Day 6, barely any cravings

Starting to find it disgusting watching people smoke, smelling it etc, I don't want to become THAT non smoker but I will lol

Any time I do feel a trigger I come here and try to reply to someone, or just remind myself that there is no way in hell I want to go through hell week ever again. :)

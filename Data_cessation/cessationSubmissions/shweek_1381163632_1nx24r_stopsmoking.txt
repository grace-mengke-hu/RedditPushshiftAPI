I don't want to mess around any more, I'm ready to quit. Just looking for a little guidance.

I've tried to quit cold turkey before several times and that obviously didn't work out. I'm ready to put this stupid habit behind me and I'm willing to try almost anything. I guess I'm just looking for all the help I can get. Do oral fixations work well? Should I slowly ween myself off? Just looking for a little guidance from those that have successfully quit.

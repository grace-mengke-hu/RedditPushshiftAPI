It's day 3 and my real challenge starts now

I'm going to work in an hour. My first work day smoke free. I'm panicking, I know this is going to be hard because work is what started me smoking in the first place.

I've got a giant water bottle, a pack of gummy bears, and a firm resolve not to give up on myself. I can do this and I WILL do this. I will watch my money stay in the bank. I will feel my body healing. I will love myself enough to do what I need to do. I will be free.

How do i motivate my girlfriend to quit smoking?

My girlfriend is pretty young (18) and she is only smoking for a couple of years, Now i don't want to force her on anything, i want to find a way to motivate / encourage her to quit smoking on her own. How can i do that? 

A little background on me. I'm 25 years old, i started smoking when i was 15 and stopped when i was 23, it's been almost two years since i stopped. But the thing is she can't quit the same way i did, i can't give her advice on how i did it. I did it by sheer willpower and i did it to challenge myself and to prove to myself that i can do it. But she is not like that, she doesn't care about that stuff.

78 days in and craving again.

I've not smoked since July 11th. I didn't even keep track of the days properly I just had an app tell me. Lately though I have been craving a cigarette terribly.

 I think it's the fall that's doing it to me. Also I started watching a couple different new shows and they smoke every scene. I finished one show and I abandoned the other.

I keep coming back to just wanting one hand rolled cigarette. No matter what anti-smoking thing I read or advertisement I see I am still craving. 
Any tips to get over this?

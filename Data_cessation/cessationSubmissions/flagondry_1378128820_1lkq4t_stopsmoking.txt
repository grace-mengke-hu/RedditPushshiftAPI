Using E-cigs?

Are E-cigs a good aid for quitting, or are they just prolonging the nicotine addiction? I'm using them and my health in general feels so much better after just a few days of being tobacco-free, but I'm concerned that I'm not really "stopping" because I'm still taking nicotine. I plan to go from using "medium" to "low" to the "no nicotine" cartridges over the next few days. 

What do you guys think?

**Update:** After hearing your opinions on e-cigs I have decided to ditch mine. I don't like how they are unregulated and there is a lack of research into their effects, never mind the fact that I am just making it harder to quit in the long run. Thank you all for sharing your thoughts, this has been really helpful!

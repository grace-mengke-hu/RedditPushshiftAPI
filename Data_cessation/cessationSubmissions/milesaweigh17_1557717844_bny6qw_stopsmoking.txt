I can’t even imagine smoking a cigarette while sober, but I’ll smoke half a pack in a night while drinking. How can I stop?

There was a brief period when I was in college where I would smoke while sober, but I’m not even interested (and even find the smell disgusting) if I’m not drinking. 

I have this weird addiction to smoking while drinking though. It’s so bad that I can’t picture drinking without smoking. Sometimes I’ll power through the first few drinks just so I can get to the point where I feel like smoking. Some nights, I tell myself I won’t smoke and will leave my cigarettes at home. I just end craving them badly and will walk to the nearest convenience store to buy a pack. 

Any tips for getting past this? I went over a month without drinking and smoking before, but the cravings immediately came back after I allowed myself to drink again. 

Thanks!

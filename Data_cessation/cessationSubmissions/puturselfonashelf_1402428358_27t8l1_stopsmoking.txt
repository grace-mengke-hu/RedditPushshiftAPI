Dealing with emotions after quitting??

I quit four weeks ago. I work out every morning for 45 minutes. I take the stairs. I'm trying. I still get so angry at NOTHING. I feel like either I never learned to deal with anger and stress or I have totally forgotten. I'm not going to smoke cigs, I don't want to, but I'm tired of feeling frayed. Any advice??

20 days after

So I am smokefree since 12/24/18. The funny thing is that I hadn't actually planned to stop.
But it turns out the pain in my abdomen i was experiencing the day before was from acute appendicitis which eventually perforated my colon. 
I was operated on on Christmas Eve. The following days i was too weak to go outside and too occupied with all that post-op stuff to even think about smoking.
I spend a week in the hospital which was enough to get rid of the actual nicotin-addiction.
Even though I spend Christmas in the Hospital and worried my poor mother sick, i got myself the best present i ever received.
I am still  thinking about lighting one up once or twice a day, but its far more manageable than i ever imagined.
So my tip is: If you ever end up in h
ospital for a few days, go cold-turkey.

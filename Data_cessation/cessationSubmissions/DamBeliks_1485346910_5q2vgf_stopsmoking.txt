10 days and keep resisting temptation...

I've been smoking for 8 years, and 10 days ago quit it.
I feel like I can do it, I can definitely stop smoking, but there are moments when it becomes really hard... And, then, I doubt of myself.

Tomorrow night, I'm having a party with old colleagues, and everyone of them smoke. And, everybody knows that with the beer, or generally drunk, the urge of smoke increases to the top! 

What about a electronic cigarrete? Does it work? Do you recommend it??? I don't know...

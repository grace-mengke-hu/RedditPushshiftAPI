[Day 32] It's a little like a breakup, isn't it?

Been more than a month. My cravings are all psychological now. I miss smoking as if it were a recent ex, the sensation of sitting out on the patio as if it were a hand at the small of my back.

It was worse the first week, as many of you have pointed out. I would lie there some nights, listening to that evil internal logic where it's ok to text one more time, one last indulgence won't hurt. But I remember what that last smoke was like. Not only did I steal it out of someone else's pack, but it was one of those bad cigarettes where you feel absolutely nothing. You know what I'm talking about? It kills the craving, but the guilt and nicotine twist your stomach and now both your hands are cold too. I used to alternate on cold nights, shove the free hand in my pocket every half a minute. My pants would smell like stale cigarettes.

Forgive the stream of consciousness. Thank you all for giving me something to scroll when I had to get through ten minutes.

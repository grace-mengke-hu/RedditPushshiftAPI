social smoker my ass!

As far back as I remember; I hated the idea of cigarettes. I couldn’t understand how anyone (aka Dad) would want to ingest smoke. I would grimace and move away from him whenever he reached for his lighter. I hated the smoke; I hated the smell and I hated how it made my eyes itch. As a child I may not have known of the health risks, but I knew that you were supposed to run *from* smoke, not *towards* it!

 
At age 13 I still knew that smoking was wrong but my desire to fit in with the cool kids was greater than my desire not to smoke. Twelve pence bought me a ‘single’ from a shop just outside of the school gates.
 
The first match I used went out before I could light my cigarette, so did the second and the third. Surprisingly the other boys didn’t mock me, it was like they understood. Then I remembered how my dad would puff into the cigarette as he lit it. So I did the same and we were off! Oddly, nobody spoke much, seemingly more interested in savouring the moment than ruining it with conversation.

 
My social smoking experiment lasted but a few days. I feigned the act of smoking by rolling the smoke around in my mouth and blowing it out as I couldn’t figure out how to inhale! It seemed my ineptitude would be my saviour, for now.

 
Age 19, I bought my first box of cigarettes in a nightclub to compliment my Jack Daniels and Coke. It felt cool; it felt right and the achievement of finally learning to inhale warranted lighting up another, and another. Chain-smoking on a night out became the norm. It was okay though as I was only a “social smoker”. I never smoked during the day and could easily go without lighting up for weeks at a time.

 
Although I had been working in a newsagent at the time, selling cigarettes was never something I took much notice of until now. The boxes went from being inanimate objects to little parcels of pleasure.

 
I used to keep my half opened boxes of cigarettes in my bag at home and would only unzip the side compartment of my bag before a night out. But now they would catch my eye several times a day. The zipper that was always firmly shut just happened to be partially open, exposing the corner of that gold box of twenty.

 
Although I felt the calling I didn’t succumb to it right away. I had always smoked under the cover of darkness and this gave me a degree of control, telling myself that choosing to smoke only meant I wasn’t addicted. It took another week before the urge became too much to resist. I pulled that box out my bag and lit up for the first time ever during daylight hours. In that very moment I knew that I no longer had control, but I buried that voice as soon as it surfaced.

 
**Social smoker my ass!**
 
Fifteen years later, at age 34, I lit up for the very last time.
 
**What made me quit?**
 
We have an amazing capacity for self-delusion. That very first puff of the cigarette tastes revolting. Your throat acknowledges that there is an alien substance attempting to enter your system and blocks it and you cough it out. Our body is telling us to stop by giving us these obvious signs, it knows that what we are trying to ingest is poison. Yet we persist until we become accustomed to the act inhaling and exhaling smoke. Soon we even begin to enjoy the taste. This is when we have become addicted.
 
A part of me had been trying to tell me to stop for years, but my lighter holding hand always triumphed over that voice from within. At first I acknowledged the truth that I was addicted. That this was no longer a voluntary action from my part. The awareness of not having control over my actions began to affect me. It made me feel powerless and I could no longer ignore that voice anymore.
 
Once I accepted the truth, the act of self-delusion was shattered.
 
I took an immediate dislike to the taste of cigarettes. So I gave up cigarettes but I still wasn’t quite ready to quit so I switched to smoking roll ups! They were cheaper and they tasted better. But soon they began to taste just as horrible as the cigarettes. Yet the horrible taste was nothing compared to my breath. You know something needs to change when you can notice the pungent, nausea-inducing stink of your own breath!
 
It was now abundantly clear that I was only smoking out of habit and not for pleasure.
 
One March morning I finished building what was to be my last roll-up. Struggling to light up, I took a deeper puff than I had intended and felt a huge rush to the head. It tasted so bad that I docked out the half finished roll-up and walked back towards the office. As I entered the lift I began feeling nauseous. I was about to pass out, in a lift, with two complete strangers!
 
Gasping for air whilst trying not to let on to others, I managed to hold out till the doors opened. I exited lift, took a few deep breaths and sat down on the floor in the corridor. In those final hazy minutes, I knew I would never smoke again.
 
I didn’t stop smoking for health for health reasons. I didn’t stop for family or to save money.
 
I stopped smoking because my desire to quit became greater than my desire to continue.
 
The very day I consciously acknowledged my addiction was the day that cigarettes began to taste like shit! My unhealthy and destructive marriage with nicotine was coming to an end.
 
To assist with my cessation I pulled out a quit smoking chart I had ordered a while back from the NHS and stuck it on the front of my wardrobe. At the end of each smoke free day I would place a sticker on the chart, marking my progress. I also attached a photo of my family with my late father to remind myself of how much I used to hate the smoke; the smell and how it made my eyes itch!
 
Kicking the habit was the one of the greatest achievements of my life. Not because of the obvious health benefits, but because I had made a conscious choice to regain control!
 
*March 20th 2015 will be five years to the day that I stopped smoking.* 
 
Once you consciously accept that you are a smoker, you will find reasons to stop. At first you may notice gentle nudges, but soon those nudges will manifest into action. Just as I found my own reasons to start smoking, I found my own reasons to stop too. If you have been getting those gentle nudges, then maybe it’s time for you to find your reasons. Who knows, maybe that reason is today!

**How to overcome a craving**

Simply use your forefinger to draw a continuous circle in the area of the back of your hand between your thumb and the forefinger of your other hand in an anti-clockwise motion. Stay intensely present in the moment, feel the sensation of your skin against your forefinger. Continue to draw that circle slowly. With every touch you are rolling back your craving, one circle at a time, mindfully and with purpose. If your mind wanders back to the craving, just gently return to the moment. Soon, you will notice a heightened sensitivity in your touch and within a minute the craving will subside, at this point double tap the back of your hand with your finger, signifying that the craving is no more.

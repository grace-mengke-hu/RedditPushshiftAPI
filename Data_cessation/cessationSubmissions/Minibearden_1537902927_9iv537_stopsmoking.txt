Smoked my (hopefully) last cigarette three hours ago.

New here.  Realized today that I spend at least two hundred bucks a month on smokes.  I decided to quit.  I've tried to ween myself off before, vaping some of the time and smoking the rest. 
 It never worked, so I'm going "cold turkey." 
 I've got my vape and my juice from my previous attempt to slowly ween myself down.  I've got my sunflower seeds for work (local truck driver).  Any other suggestions or tips on kicking the coffin nails and staying off of them?

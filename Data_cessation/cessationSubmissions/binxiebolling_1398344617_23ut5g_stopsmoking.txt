Resetting

Hey errybody. I quit just over a month ago. I screwed up and smoked later that week. Shrugging it off because I was so proud of my self, I continued on. As each day passed without a smoke I felt more and more confident. Last weekend though, I smoked two cigarettes and I just stole a couple last night from my mom whom I'm visiting and smoked them after a few beers and now I'm resetting my badge and I hope you're all fuckin happy. This is me being honest.

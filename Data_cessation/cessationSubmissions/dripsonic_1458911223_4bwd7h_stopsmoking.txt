3 weeks smoke free checking in

Tonight marks the 3 week point since i smoked my last cigarette.  The cravings have subsided mostly to only when i get stressed or hungry, but I've been doing a damn good job of not binge/over eating, which i'm almost just as proud of as the quitting,  Only problem, peeps, is that i am still feeling depressed and mentally slow and generally irritable.  It has gotten better than it was that first week, but damn, i thought it would have cleared up by now.  Idk, maybe I'm being naive, i was smoking, more or less, for 14 years.  I'm determined to move on and not considering going back.  But when can i look forward to my brain chemistry balancing out and feeling normal or like myself again? Any thoughts? Should i just be patient? Should i consider visiting a doctor for some kind of script?

Tl;dr: 3weeks in, still feeling depressed and slow...how long does this last?

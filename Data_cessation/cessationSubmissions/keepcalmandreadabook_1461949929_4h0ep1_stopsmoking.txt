Day 3, I know I can do this.

Hell, I have to do this, since I'm broke. (Well, I've had desperate times before where I would go out just to find refries at gas stations, so that's not true.) 

Caved after 150 days 2 or 3 days ago. On day 3 today, which is the last day I'll have a nicotine urge. Can't wait to get past this again and get back up to almost 6 months. 

I was *THIS* close to making it to six months, I know I can do 3 days again.

How I made it easy (the hard way) [warning:long]

At the beginning of the year I decided that 2015 was going to be the year I quit smoking. At that point I was convinced it was a habit that I needed to break, so I started reading all sorts of articles and books on habits and how to break them and form new ones. Today I can't really believe how ignorant I was back then... which is one of the reasons why I want to share this post with other quitters.


During my "I believe it's a habit" phase, I attempted to move my regular cigarettes of the day around a bit - like skip the one right after getting up in the morning, and simply delay it until after breakfast (when I would have one anyway). I would also attempt to form some sort of new habit in its place, like spending a few minutes stretching in the morning, or do the dishes right after dinner instead of smoking right away (I would eventually though). I didn't get anywhere with this, as I was still smoking just as much, only at different times/places. 


Next up was attempting to cut down. Got an app on my phone that would gradually decrease the number of cigarettes as the days go by, depending on how long of a period you cut down over. This meant registering every cigarette smoked to know when you could have your next one. I don't like being told what to do, so naturally this wasn't really my thing to begin with. But, I gave it an honest shot and as I got to half of my usual consumption I was simply feeling so miserable that I think I self sabotaged by "forgetting" to register cigarettes smoked. Like I said, my heart wasn't in it to begin with...


Then I got the brilliant idea to buy equipment to start smoking electronic cigarettes. After an initial phase of testing, by substituting some cigarettes with smoking e-cigs, I made two attempts. They both lasted less than 24 hours. 


I had read Allen Carr's "The easy way to stop smoking" about 5 years prior, and decided to read it again. Back when I read it the first time I quit for 5 days, and never attempted again until this year. I think I might have broken one of Allen's "rules" by attempting to quit before finishing the book. Anyway, this time around I was determined to be a good girl and read the whole thing, and follow ALL the instructions. So I did. And then I quit, and it lasted 2 days. Then I read it again, quit - and it lasted 1 day. This book goes on and on about how easy it is to quit smoking if you just follow the instructions, so why on earth was it so hard for me? I was convinced I simply hadn't gotten rid of all the brainwashing that I had been subjected to over the years, so I kept on reading hoping it would get easier the next time. It wasn't. So naturally I started questioning Allen Carr's method, and came to the conclusion that the book was lacking in the science department. Where was the research? What actually happens in the brain and body when you smoke? What happens when you quit?


So I basically started looking up articles on the subject, and it eventually got me to whyquit.com. Founded by another individual committed to helping people quit smoking, but this guy? He put it all online for free. For that reason alone I decided to trust him. His focus wasn't on how easy it was, or how magical and beautiful the process was, but rather how to make it run as smoothly as possible. He gave advice, and backed it up with science. Like the fruit juice trick to make sure your blood sugar level is good the first 2-3 days. There are a lot of videos and articles on that site, and I watched/read a lot of them both as preparation and help. This was where I became aware of how important triggers are, and how important it is to face them head on when you quit.


My "relationship" with cigarettes has always been complicated. Started out casual, then a few phases on and off as regular/casual, then stopping for a while, before getting back to regular. All in all it had lasted about 15 years. The last 5 years I was a secret smoker (or closet smoker), which meant I could go days without it, even weeks if I was on vacation with someone I didn't want to see me smoke. The latter baffled me. How could I go two weeks without cigarettes when I was travelling without feeling little or no cravings, but the moment I got back home the first thing I would do was light up because I felt an intense urge to do so? The answers is simple: Triggers. My trigger wasn't "after a meal", it was "after a meal at my kitchen table". So, when you leave your usual surroundings those triggers disappear. 


My next hurdle was preparing myself for the loss I would be going through, because I have at times used cigarettes as something to look forward to when things get tough. During most of my quits I would get intense emotional episodes during the first few days, and I would constantly feel lonely. I know now that the intense emotional episodes are the brain's way of trying to get me to smoke, and that sense of loneliness comes from feeling like there's something missing, something that was always present. None of them are dangerous, and they both pass. How did I get there? I took it one quit at a time, I studied my responses, debated with myself, wrote down reminders for myself to use during my next quit. All I really wanted was to end up the way that Allen Carr's book intended - feeling like it was "easy". 


And I finally did it! I know I'm "only" 3 weeks in, but I'm sure. Why? Knowledge is power. I know why I smoked, I know why I struggled to quit, and I know why I never want to put myself in that position ever again. I didn't just decided on a whim one day, I made it into a project. A challenge to see if it could actually be done the "easy way". And it can.


To sum up:
 - It's not a habit. 
 - Cutting down only puts you in a constant state of withdrawal. 
 - Nicotine replacement doesn't remove the addiction, or the control it has on you. 
 - The toughest physical withdrawal lasts for 2-3 days, then it gradually decreases as your brain chemistry starts healing itself.
 - The sooner you face your triggers the easier they are to face, and you feel an intense sense of pride for achieving it.
 - Don't avoid thinking about it. Control your thoughts towards reasons why not to instead.  


I was controlled by someone I considered a friend for 15 years. Someone who turned out to be a complete psychopath. No more, I say. No more.

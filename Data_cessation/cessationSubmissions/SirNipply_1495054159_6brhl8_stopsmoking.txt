Day five on the patch

And honestly I feel worse than I did smoking. I can breathe better but my chest gets random pains (not heart related, I'm wearing a 30 heart monitor and they say all's clear), I get dizzy, I'm tired, a shit several times a day. 

Is this normal for the patch and if so how long does it last cause its so hard not to want to smoke.

I wish I'd never read Allen Carr's book

So I'm 12 days into my quit, and today has been fucking horrible. My wife of 10 years is talking about separating for a little while with me keeping the kids. And then I had to go be nice and social for something all afternoon with the thoughts of separation trying to be front burner the whole time.

Any other quit and I'd be smoking right now. This is just more than I feel I can handle unassisted.

But I've learned how nicotine doesn't really help *anything*. It won't make this any easier to deal with. It won't fix a damn thing. I used to think it could, and I wish like hell I could believe that now.

And so I'm feeling very rough, and I'm still a non-smoker.

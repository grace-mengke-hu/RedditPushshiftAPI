Stress finally hammered me after 20 days.

Was doing great, 20 days without a single puff when some major stress triggers hit three days ago. I went and bought two packs and have a half a pack left. I've adjusted my Smoke Free app to reflect my infractions, but I won't reset my quit date.

I'm going to have to be strong tomorrow going forward.

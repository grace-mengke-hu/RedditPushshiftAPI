481 days, and back to zero for me. And I'm asking for your guys help, because this time I really need it.

It's not really 481 days, because 2 months ago I started smoking again. My trigger was the birth of my second child, or at least the stress and postnatal baby blues that came with him. For a month succeeding his birth I had no desire to start smoking again, but after that month I had a bit of a melt down and bought a packet. Since then I have slowly increased from one a day, to about 7. Whilst 7 isn't as high as my pack a day or more I was smoking several years ago, it's coupled by binge-smokes where I will smoke half a packet in one go, usually when I drink.

After these binge-smoking nights I wake up in the middle of the night riddled with guilt. The biggest reason I have so much guilt is because of my children, I am afraid of the repercussions smoking will have on watching them grow up. And when I say afraid, I mean riddled with fear. And yet, when it comes 5 o'clock and it's time to put dinner on, the wine will open, and all of a sudden it doesn't seem like as big a deal as it did at 4AM. And so it cycles, a constant battle of guilt and lack of will-power. 

My issues are:

* I don't recognize myself as a smoker, mostly because I do it behind closed doors, and therefore don't recognize the need to quit at times. 

* When I do think about quitting, a large part of me says *I don't want to*, which I understand is nicotine, but it's still a very large voice among others, and thus far it's won. 

* I have a slight dependency on alcohol too. In that 5 out of 7 evenings a week I *'need'* a glass of wine before I don't feel stressed anymore. I don't drink more than 2-3 units per occasion, however it is a massive trigger for smoking. I tried to cut out alcohol completely last month, but that came creeping back after a trip to France. 

* Coffee is another trigger, but I love it. I live for it. I managed to retain coffee with my first quit, after a bit of routine shifting. 

* Until now I have seen smoking as my 'adult time', which is bullshit, but it's one of the biggest barriers I have to stopping. 

* I live in a new country with no friends, and no family (bar my son and partner). Smoking has become one of the only form of companionship that I have here. At least that is what the cigarettes tell me. 

* Everyone smokes in the UK. Honestly, I was so shocked when I got here because in comparison to New Zealand, it really is a 'norm'. Also, they are much *much* cheaper here, so finances became less of a barrier. 

* I have self-destructive tendencies due to post natal anxiety. I am fine, level headed most of the time, but occasionally I'll just have a melt-down and that is when I am off to the off-licence to get a bottle of wine and some cigarettes. 

So, my biggest barrier here is definitely myself. I don't want to smoke, for gods sake it's killing me inside each time I see my wonderful 3 month old and think *god woman, you could miss out on him*. But I just can't seem to push it this time. I just almost can't be *bothered* to quit and it's devastating. 

Any help would be so very much appreciated, I'm feel so unconvicted and out of my depth here.

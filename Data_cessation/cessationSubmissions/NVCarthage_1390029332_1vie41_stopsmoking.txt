Long time-lurker, first time poster. One whole day as a non-smoker.

Four years a smoker. I'm 23, and according to cessation nation I haven't smoked in one day, one hour, and 43 minutes. Seems like I can feel every second ticking by. I wanna claw my (or someone else's) eyes out. When does this start getting better?

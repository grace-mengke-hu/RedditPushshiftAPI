After you quit smoking...

...you realize how disgusting the addiction is, how cigarettes don't even taste or smell good, like your mind made you believe, but are actually quite disgusting, a poisonous smell that lingers.
It's amazing how our minds can rationalize anything. Amazing, but scary. 
Just wanted to share.

26, Smoking since 17, Day 1 of Quitting

I've done this before and I'm doing it again and for the last time today.

Finally got the excuse I've been waiting for, 2 weeks without my dedicated smoking partner, my boss.  I'm only a few hours in, but I'm already fidgeting, very hungry, and getting those craving thoughts.  But they're all temporary, aren't they?  It'll go away soon enough.

Let's do this!

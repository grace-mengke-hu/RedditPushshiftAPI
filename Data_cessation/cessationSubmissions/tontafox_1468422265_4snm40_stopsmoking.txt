day 2 and hating life

I grew up in a house where all 3 adults smoked excessively in the house with little ventilation and in the cars and all around my brother and I. Didn't fully pick up the habit til around 16 but it feels like I've been smoking my whole life. Usually about a half a pack a day, sometimes more depending on stress. I lost one of my jobs this week so decided to quit because I can no longer afford it, ($9-$11/pack in CT and MA) and was wondering if gum or patches are worth it? I don't want to spend the money on it but if people think its worth it maybe I should give it a shot. I haven't done much research because honestly just looking at a cigarette makes me want one...

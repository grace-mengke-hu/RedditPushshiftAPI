Relapsed badly after about six months. Need help staying quit when work gets tough.

Hi everyone,

Last holiday season I was able to quit smoking because my employment situation changed and I had some time off. I went to a hotel by myself to sweat out the hardest 72-hour period without being a jerk to everyone around me (ha ha).

I managed to stay tobacco free for about six months after that â€“ even after going back to work and dealing with some high pressure situations. Sure, I put on some stress weight, but at least I wasn't smoking.

However, this fall I started grad school and the stress has been too much for me to handle without cigarettes. Between the mountains of reading, extracurricular activities and anxiety about grades, I am back to smoking 10+ cigarettes a day.

It sucks and I don't want to continue this way. But I find myself freezing up in front of the computer whenever I try to write or get some work done without nicotine in my system.

Can anyone please offer me advice as to how to quit smoking without killing productivity levels? I can't afford to take time off as there is so much work to be done!

Thanks so much.

P.S. I have already requested for my badge to be removed so please ignore the seemingly impressive number next to my name. Wish it were true! :P

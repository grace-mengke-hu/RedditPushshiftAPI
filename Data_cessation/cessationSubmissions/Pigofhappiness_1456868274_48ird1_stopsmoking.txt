Why can't I quit?

So I kind of hate myself - nearly 20 weeks pregnant and I've managed to cut down massively but not quit smoking. Have attempted over 10 times now. My final quit date is this Friday and I really really want and need to do it this time. Why is the health of my baby not more important than bloody smoking? Does anyone have any tips to help with the terrible cravings and more importantly the horrible excuses and self justifications my brain starts very convincingly sending out in order to make me smoke again?

Staying strong

I thought that I wasn't having too much difficulty with quitting after smoking a pack a day for the past seven years. Last night though I took a really hard hit at roller derby and thought I'd messed my knee up. I work as a ski instructor so bad knees mean I lose my job in 2 1/2 weeks. Suddenly the urge to smoke hit me like a ton of bricks. I haven't given in yet but it doesn't help that my friends keep saying "But you could have just one to take the edge off right?"
Please help me stay strong right now

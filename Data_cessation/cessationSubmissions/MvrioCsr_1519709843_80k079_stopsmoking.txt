The effect of cigarettes in my skin

I first started smoking at 16, the same age that i started having problems with A LOT of pimples, black heads, oiliness skin, and before that i used to have a perfect skin, just little black heads, one pimple per week and a very smooth skin. I’m a social smoker, whenever i go to a party or go for a walk and talk to friends, i smoke, and i dont smoke at my house, soo since these 3 years as a “smoker” i have gone a lot of 1-2 months nicotine free, just because i wasnt going out, i remeber that i dated a girl and she asked me to stop, i was able to stop during 5 months due to not going to partys anymore.
Cold be the cigarettes the cause of my acne that just gets worse past the years? Any of you guys relate to this and what can i do about it?

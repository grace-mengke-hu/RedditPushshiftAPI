HOLY CRAP! I made it to 4 weeks!!!

WOOHOO!    First of all, thanks to all of you here on this sub for just being here.  NO way I could have reached this milestone without your stories, support, troubles, and inspiration.  We are all in this together.

Second, at 4 weeks in:
- My confidence in myself has increased; still not rockstar confident, but every day I don't give in to a smoke is another boost in personal strength
- my running is so much easier and I have even gotten a bit faster
- I am 5 pounds heavier than I was when smoking, but look sooo much healthier
- my wife doesn't complain about me smelling bad
- I can think more clearly than I could while smoking
- my daughter doesn't ask me why I stink
- I don't need to go outside every hour at work to have one
- I am not being controlled by my addiction and can focus more on what I am actually doing rather than on the next fix
- I have gone into stressful situations and not had to smoke
- I still have some anxiety, but am finding better ways to deal with it than smoking
- I haven't had 285 cigs, have avoided 2.85g of tar, and have not spent $95.48 on cigs.

A milestone indeed!   Looking forward to the future, but taking it one day at a time.

Good luck to you all!

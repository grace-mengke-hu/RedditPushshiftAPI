Advice for a reluctant quitter?

I've been lurking for a while now. I've badged up twice but couldn't stand up to it.  When I have cigarettes I want to quit. I'm ready to quit. 

When I'm out of money it's easy to plan on quitting but as soon as I have money in my pocket it quickly guides me to a smoke shop.

I've made it through the last half of many days but waking up and missing all of my habitual smokes ends with me finding a pack and smoking it as fast as I can so I can reach the end and start the next quit.

Cigarettes are killing me physically and financially and I don't know how to get past the first 24 hours. 

I've considered asking here if anyone has a copy of Allen Carr they'd be willing to send me but I feel like a shitty lost cause. 

Does this sound like your fight? Any advice would be welcome.

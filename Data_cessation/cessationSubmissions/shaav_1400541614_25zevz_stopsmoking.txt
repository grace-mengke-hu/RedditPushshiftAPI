One Year. I can't believe it! ONE YEAR! :D

Dear /r/stopsmoking, 

you people are the best! I would have never succeeded without you, thank you sososo much! :D

One year ago, I stopped smoking. I smoked my last cigarette on May, 19th 2013 at 9:30 PM, and destroyed the remaining cigarettes in the sink. The following day I had my coffee without a cigarette for the first time in many years. I still remember it very well: I was sitting there with my cup of coffee in my hands, confused and not knowing what to do. I knew what was missing. It felt so weird, so wrong not to smoke. The first few weeks nothing felt right. My body felt awful, the withdrawal symptoms weren't easy to deal with. I couldn't even distract myself with a book: Reading reminded me of smoking because I loved to read and smoke at the same time. It still feels odd, but it's way better now. Everything gets better. Once you stop, you overwrite every memory, every association. It takes time and a huge amount of energy, but it's completely worth it. And it gets easier. Way easier! :)

I quit cold turkey, never caved in. The first three weeks were the hardest, especially the first one. Instead of smoking I started drinking tea. Because I was a pack-a-day smoker, it was a huge amount of tea, haha! :) The mug in my hands helped me with my restless hands and preparing tea was a ritual similar to lighting up. My sister didn't stop. We always smoked together outside. I joined her nonetheless, but instead of lighting a cigarette I fetched a cup of tea and enjoyed it. This helped so much. I learned not to care about people smoking in my presence. 

My posts from those first few weeks can still be found [here (1 day)](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/1eq97g/i_cant_think_of_anything_else_this_stupid/), [here (7 days)](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/1f24tn/my_7th_day_one_week_woah_d_im_so_proud_of_myself_d/), [here (31 days)](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/1goqta/look_at_my_badge_ive_earned_my_first_star_d/) and [here (180 days)](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/1qot1m/180_days_6_months_im_so_happy_d/).   

After 6 months, things started to get normal again. Now, after one year, I barely think of cigarettes anymore. I'm still extremely cautious - I'm well aware of how easy it is to underestimate the danger of relapsing. The addiction is still there - I guess I'll be an addict for the rest of my life. But fortunately, my addiction doesn't control every single part of my life anymore, which feels amazing! :D A life without cigarettes is a free life! :D

Probably the most important thing though: I wouldn't have been able to pay for evening lessons without stopping. If everything works out, I'll finally finish my A-Levels in July, at the age of 27. :) 

Also, I'd like to congratulate /u/Gnashy! :D We're on the same /r/stopsmoking schedule and have been stumbling across each other on this sub repeatedly :D WE DID IT, WOOHOO!!!! :D 

EDIT: OMFG I have a smiley-star! :D FINALLY! Aww! :D :D

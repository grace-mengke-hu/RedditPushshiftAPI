Is quitting a skill?


Doing tobacco for some 15 years. I used to quit for a couple of weeks each year. The last half year or so I've put into practice quitting every Monday. 

The pro is that I really get used to and familiar with the effects of emptying the body of nicotine. At this stage it's almost like a enjoyable 'trip'. A competition against myself to find ways to lay off steam without smoking. 
Meanwhile it is easy to motivate myself to go through with it, since I know if I fail to stay off I restart the next Monday. I never use nicotine replacement to quit the nicotine. However found it useful to mix up how to get my nicotine fix, a few days prior to going cold turkey. Mixing or replacing cigarettes with Swedish snus, chewing tobacco, pipe, nicotine patches.

The cons are obvious, why not just smoke one if I can restart quitting the following monday again?

The failure comes within 3 days or at the two weeks mark, when I realise and convince myself that it really is not so difficult or even painful to quit. And if I'm so good at it, why not enjoy life with a cigarette just for this weekend?

On day 4 this time, doing good. After learning to handle the extreme cravings and physical discomfort, it is now time to learn to handle the twisted reasoning. If I fail just a new training  session next Monday.

Eventhough I keep going through the process, I slowly progress and in the end up spending mote days without nicotine than with.

I know I somewhat come across as a masochist but it truly gets less and less tiring. 

Does anyone else have experience of quitting in the same manner?

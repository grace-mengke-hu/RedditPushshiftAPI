Anybody feel calmer after quitting smoking?

As the title says, does anybody feel calmer after quitting smoker? I was mainly a snus user, smoked maybe a few cigs per week and when I was drinking. Snus is safer than cigarettes but more addictive since it has more nicotine and you can have on in your mouth basically 24/7.  It has now gone a week with zero nicotine and I can't help but notice I have been very calm this past week. Maybe I was a bit irritated the first few days and maybe I have been calm because I got sick a few days after quitting but still im interested in knowing. Has anybody noticed a correlation between quitting nicotine and becoming more calmer? 

Sorry for my english not native

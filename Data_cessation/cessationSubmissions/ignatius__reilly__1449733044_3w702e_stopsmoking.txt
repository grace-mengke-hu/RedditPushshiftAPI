Day 4, winding down

Finishing up day four smoke free. I think the most surprising part about quitting cold turkey is how scarce the nasty side effects seem to be - aside from indulging in a few good cries, and an entire stick of Starbursts during a bad traffic jam, I haven't felt as out of sorts as expected. I managed to make this happen after finishing Alan Carr's book a few weeks ago, and - after quitting for 24-96 hours and then relapsing a few times since ;) - keep reminding myself, when I do get the occasional craving for a smoke, that the minute I light up is the minute I'll start feeling guilty for picking one up and reintroduce nicotine into my system (two birds), and that I will be jonesing harder than I was previously if I do decide to smoke just *one* cigarette. Logic > desire. A few other helpful things: stepping outside during work breaks to inhale fresh air, drinking water, tracking progress on "smoke free" app, taking walks whenever possible, and reading this subreddit (seriously, guys - you're to thank for all of the Starburst I ate, in lieu of smoking a cigarette, when I was stuck in my car for forty-five minutes - the support is invaluable). Anyway, thanks for reading, and I believe in those of you who are currently trying to quit!

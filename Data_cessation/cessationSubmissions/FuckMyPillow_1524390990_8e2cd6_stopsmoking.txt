Currently in the back of a cop car.

I was given a ride home after a party tonight and my disgusting addiction drove my drunk brain to leave the house in my car. I drove into a tree, now I’m sitting in the back of a cop car, because I’m an idiot, but I wouldn’t have left if I wasn’t addicted to cigarettes. Please, any words of wisdom will help, and I feel that I’m at an all-time low, I’m only 19. Thank you for reading this.

2 weeks in, my peepee is bigger

So I recently moved from Asia (where cigarettes are cheaper than water) to the UK (where it's expensive and not cool any more) and it's been super easy quitting honestly.

I've been here about 2 weeks and haven't smoked for that long. Just gotta say, my flaccid peepee is consistently much bigger. I definitely think it's due to better hydration and circulation from quitting.

Has anyone else experienced this? If so, how great is it!

I'm 23 years old and been smoking for over 5 years. I decided it's time to stop, but don't know how to make it last for the rest of my life.

Hello everyone,

I have started smoking when I was 17. Now I'm 23 and smoke about a pack (20 cigarettes) each day. In the last year I started feeling bad, got headaches, breathing difficulties and started to get tired very quickly. Thank God I'm not terminally ill. Because of that I have recently decided that I have to quit smoking before it kills me.

Tried quitting 3 or 4 times before, my best was about a month and after each trial quitting gotten harder and harder. I want to quit definetely, like everyone in this subreddit I think. And here comes my question:

What do you do to not come back to smoking? I would be especially grateful for opinions from people who had hard time trying to quit but figured out how to do it and did not started smoking again.

I know how to quit for a short time, did it few times, but have no idea how to make it last. After "quitting" I'm feeling consistent urge to smoke, even after month without a cigarrete. I don't like it. I don't like the smell and don't like the way my body reacts to this shit.

I will appreciate any help, even the tiniest of hints. I'm afraid it will kill me in a short time if I won't quit.

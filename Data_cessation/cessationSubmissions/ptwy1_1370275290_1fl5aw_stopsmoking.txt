Day 2 of Quitting. Just went through my most intense craving yet.

Background: I've been smoking on and off for 10 years and have made the decision to quit this disgusting habit for good. I quit for a few weeks in the fall by reading Allen Carr's book, but was prescribed Adderall for ADHD and the cravings were incredibly intense and I gave in (I wasn't prepared). Last week, I was prescribed Wellbutrin in addition to Adderall and it seems to have balanced my nicotine cravings somewhat and have made cigarettes taste somewhat funny. 

I knew today was going to be the hardest because I'm back at work and everyone here smokes. It is one of the biggest reasons I started smoking again. About 20 minutes ago, I'm sitting at my desk and a huge wave of anxiety comes at me out of nowhere. Every time this happens, I go outside and have a cigarette and this is all my brain was focused on. Instead, I decided to go outside and clean my car - just to get away from my desk and do something. The cravings are still there, but it's manageable now. 

Just wanted to get this off my chest and share - I'm not giving in.

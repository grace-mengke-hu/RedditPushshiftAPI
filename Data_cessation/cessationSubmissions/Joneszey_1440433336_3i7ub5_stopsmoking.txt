How relapse happens

You  can often find my words here saying it is clear in my head that smoking never did and never can do anything for me so there is nothing to miss and nothing to go back to. Well, yesterday I learned how tricky it can all be. I was confronted with mega uber-stress. The kind that makes it difficult to breathe and think at the same time. A cigarette thought came to me. Actually it was more than a thought. I could hear the call of relief from a puff as my lungs remembered the burning ecstasy of the deep inhale in the midst of stress. I told myself "you know they do nothing for you" and counter to that, the memory of the physical experience of the deep inhale. Allen Carr, whyquit.com, /u/Armison, /u/my_vape_self all liars, my mind told me. "Who can tell you you haven't experienced relief time and again? Take the moment and feel better". Conversations in my head. Some promises can make you sell your soul. I imagine that's what relapse is all about. It is bartering at its finest and the trick of addiction. The promise feels so real. Even I could not refute the addict's words or reasoning or the desire for relief. THE DESIRE FOR RELIEF. That was when I realized. A smoke wouldn't and couldn't relieve this stress. It is a faulty memory, a false association that played out in my life repeatedly over the 30 years of daily, hourly smoking. It is a virus. Nicotine quells the siren call of withdrawal that stress brings. It does not relieve any stress if you are not also in withdrawal. 

Yesterday was a triumph of knowledge over base emotion. If I had smoked it would have been for nothing more than a future of siren calls of withdrawal relieved only by more smoking. Then the promise would be real. 

Thank you, thank you, thank you guys for teaching me so much.

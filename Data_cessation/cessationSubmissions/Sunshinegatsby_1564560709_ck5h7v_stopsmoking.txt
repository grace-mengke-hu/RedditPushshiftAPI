3 days, I'm doing it

I stopped smoking on Sunday really out of necessity. I'm running so low on cash I knew that if I bought more tobacco, I wouldn't have enough money to feed me and my kids for the week. So it wasn't even a choice, and it's actually made it so easy for me. 

Weirdly (or maybe not), it's also had a totally amazing affect on my overall mood. I've been in a really crappy place recently and was getting into a funk I couldn't get myself out of. I just felt like a total failure. Yet since I stopped on Sunday, that's totally lifted. I'm keeping busy, doing more housework, applying for more jobs, spending more time with my kids. I'm actually less grumpy and more patient with them. I don't feel like a failure anymore. 

I feel empowered, even though it wasn't really my choice to start with. 

I am using patches, and it's been going so good I wouldn't even say I've really had a craving so far until now. So I'm writing this down to remind me to keep going. 

And also, I completely love the crazy intense dreams the patches give me. An extra little added bonus for me.

I guess being poor has made me a better person ðŸ˜…

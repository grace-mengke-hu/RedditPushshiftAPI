Don't worry about making it a week, or a month, or a year. Focus on getting through each day and before you know it, you'll be there.

Don't become obsessed with the long-term goal. It can get overwhelming and stressful to think of going longer than a day without cigarettes. And when you become overwhelmed, what is all you want to do? Smoke.  

All you have to do is get through the day. Get through the day, go to bed, wake up, and just make it again until bedtime. That's it. It's a matter of hours. Simple. Before you know it, a month has gone by. Then 3 months. Half a year. One whole year. Actively take it one day at a time.

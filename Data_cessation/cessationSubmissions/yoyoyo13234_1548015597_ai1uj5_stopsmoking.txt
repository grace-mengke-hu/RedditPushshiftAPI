I'm quitting as of today.

This is kinda a support post so anyone that is trying to quit can read through and maybe we will help each other out.

I'm 15, and I started out smoking at parties. my friends would buy a pack and split it and they would get around 8 each. usually I was against cigarettes but one time someone offered me one and I decided why not. I really liked the headrush, so I had one more that night. after that, whenever my friends would buy a pack or 2, I would chip in and get my fair share as well. this was what I would do up until about 2 weeks ago.

it was my friends birthday, and I decided to buy myself a pack of export A greens for the weekend because it was gonna be a 3 day bender type thing. by the end of the weekend, the pack was gone, and I had smoked the majority of it. that brings me to today. I've been vaping over the past little while, and I've been smoking a few cigarettes a day. right now I have 1 left, and I'm going to save this one for a party. as of now. I'm going to try to taper off my usage. 

I dont want this addiction. I dont want to be a smoker well into my 40s. I've been getting craving them like crazy, and today I already had one. this one cigarette I have stashed in my dresser should be the straw that broke the camels back. at least I hope it is.

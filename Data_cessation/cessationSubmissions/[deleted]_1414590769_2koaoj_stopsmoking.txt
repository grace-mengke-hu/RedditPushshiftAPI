"Where's your Ferrari?"

>Lady : Do you smoke?

>Man : Yes

>Lady : How many packs a day?

>Man : 3 packs

>Lady : How much per pack

>Man : $10.00

>Lady : And how long have you been smoking?

>Man : 15 years

>Lady : So 1 pack costs $10.00 and you have 3 packs a day which puts your spending each month at $900. In one year, it would be $10,800 correct?

>Man : Correct

>Lady : If in 1 year you spend $10,800 not accounting for inflation, the past 15 years puts your spending at $162,000 correct?

>Man : Correct

>Lady : Do you know that if you hadn't smoked, that money could have been put in a step-up interest savings account and after accounting for compound interest for the past 15 years, you could have now bought a Ferrari?

>Man : Do you smoke?

>Lady : No

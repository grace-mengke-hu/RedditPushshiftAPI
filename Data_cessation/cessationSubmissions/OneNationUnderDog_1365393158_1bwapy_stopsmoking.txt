Pack-a-day since 20. 23 year-old trying to quit starting Tuesday morning.

Hi all. I'm a 23 year-old. I started smoking at 18 and moved to a pack-a-day at like 20 and I really want to quit after I work tomorrow night. I went for a run last night after I worked, it was the first time I have done so in years. I decided to do it after I worked because I work with a smoker and thought it would be good to be away at first. Tonight I did push ups and lifted weights. Tomorrow night  I plan to do another run just like last night. Starting Tuesday morning I want to be cigarette free. Wish me luck. Any tips on quitting cold turkey?

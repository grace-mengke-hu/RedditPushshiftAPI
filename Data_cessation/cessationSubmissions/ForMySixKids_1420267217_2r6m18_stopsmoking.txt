Six months later

I quit smoking on June 11th, 2014. I don't remember my throwaway account name but I wanted to thank this subreddit because you guys helped keep me accountable to someone. I was a secret smoker and a user of smokeless tobacco for almost 10 years and I hid it from everyone including my wife so I had noone to share with but you guys.

I felt a desire to post today because sometime between maybe months 1 and 2 of quitting I stopped thinking about smoking at all. When my last dreams of smoking stopped I never even marked the occasion. The only times I have cravings are if I'm thinking specifically about smoking and its such a small little craving I can easially dismiss it and change my thought processes. Today I just realized its been over six months and its insane how easy it is now.

Quitting took me 10 years of constantly trying to quit and suddenly after 2 HARD weeks it was over. I probably failed at least 200 times and it was worth every failure.

I am proud of myself and you will be to.

I promise you you will eventually quit and post a similar story.

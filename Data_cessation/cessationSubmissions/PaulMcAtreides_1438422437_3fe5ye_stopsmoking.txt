Thank you and please send some positive energy!

Hi guys,

First off, I'm a long time lurker on Reddit. Not just here, but everywhere. I just like reading interesting stuff and learning things that are outside my experience. I didn't have an account until last week. A friend of mine put me onto this sub, and I am eternally grateful to her because this has to be one of the most supportive and helpful subs on the whole of Reddit. 

Through this sub, I have learned a great deal. I have discovered and read Allen Carr and a lot of the content on WhyQuit. Even more important that those resources has been the real stories that you guys and girls have shared at different points in your quits. You've really opened my eyes and I think I'm now ready to escape this horrible prison that I put myself into.

I feel, as Allen Carr says, that I am a slave and I'm at the point where smoking really upsets me for so many reasons. But as he also says, I have a great deal to look forward to. Freedom from feeling like a prisoner, more energy, more focus and escaping from the thoughts that plague me throughout the day. Also, enjoying all of my hobbies without feeling guilty all of the time.

I've tentatively tried to quit before, but at that time I didn't have all of the knowledge and resources that I do now. I also live in a country where smoking is accepted everywhere and cheap. But these are all excuses.

I'm going to make today the last day that I am smoker. I'm going to get a badge too as I think that's a great system.

So, not really much else to say, other than thank you. And if you have time, some words of support or advice, they would be most appreciated.  Any tips for the first couple of days or how to look forward to the benefits that could come?

I have done my homework. I am disgusted with myself and I think that that shows that now is the time. 

Many thanks,

Paul McAtreides

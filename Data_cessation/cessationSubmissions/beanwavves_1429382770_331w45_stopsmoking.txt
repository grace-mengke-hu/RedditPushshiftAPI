Not smoking or wanting to even when I go out and have had a few!

I think I'm getting to the point where even if I'm quite intoxicated (working on that, but it still happens on occasion) I am able to turn down cigarettes from friends and I am finding I have zero urge to smoke now while imbibing.


I used to love smoking while drunk. Now I get drunk a lot less often. But it's still nice to know even if I have had a few, I'm past the late night urges of a cigarette and that those urges are now nonexistent for me.

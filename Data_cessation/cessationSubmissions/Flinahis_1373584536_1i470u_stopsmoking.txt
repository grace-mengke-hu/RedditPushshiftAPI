On day 3

Today has been the worst day so far. The last two days have been just irritating and annoying, but today has just been straight up stressful and all I want to do is go down to the store and buy a pack. I just dont want to go through withdrawal again and thats pretty much the only thing keeping me from buying another pack. That and everyone encouraging me to quit and knowing I'd be letting them down if I went and bought a pack. I NEED advice or some help to get me through this day and some reassurance it gets better, because right now its just plain fucking awful

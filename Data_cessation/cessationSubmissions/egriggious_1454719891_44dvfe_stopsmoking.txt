I feel hopeless.

Hey /r/stopsmoking. I need help. I quit smoking on New Year's Eve 36 days ago, and I found it surprisingly easy - most likely because I had only smoked for 6 months. Well 36 days later, I feel like I want a cigarette now more than ever. I know it's all in my head, but I think about smoking all the time. It doesn't help that I'm 19 years old and go to a college notorious for harboring smokers. All I want is to live a life without thinking about smoking, but I feel like I'll never be able to do that again. What should I do? Will I always feel like this? Should I just...resort to smoking again? I'm really leaning towards walking down the street and buying a pack. Please help!!!!

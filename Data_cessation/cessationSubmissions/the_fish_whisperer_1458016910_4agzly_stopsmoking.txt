Truly a non-smoker

Yesterday I was on a flight that had two failed landing attempts in stormy weather.
The plane diverted to an nearby air force base where we had to wait on the plane for 3 hours to refuel and then attempt to land at the correct airport again. In all of that time with a range of feelings from terror to mind numbing boredom to trepidation at the last attempt, it never once occured to me to even think about a cigarette. I think I'm cured.

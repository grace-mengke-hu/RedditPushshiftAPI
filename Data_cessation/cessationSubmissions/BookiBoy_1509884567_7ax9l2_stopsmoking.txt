Smoking for 10 years. I am done.

I woke up yesterday morning struggling to breath and collapsing on the floor....when it gets to that point something has to give.

I have been smoking since I was approx 17-18 years old, almost 10 years later I still am. Over it.

Havn't had a smoke since that incident, immediately went to the dr's, they were not really sure what happened but suspected it was a asthma attack....who knows.

None the less, smoking leads to things much worse then that and that was definitely one of the worst experiences of my life, if i did not have my family to calm me down at the time I am not sure what would have happened.

So its been almost two days since I have had a smoke, don't plan on going back but I do have one thing that concerns me, (although it seems kind of trivial..)

My old man is a smoker, we would normally have a smoke together and chat about what ever. Now that I don't smoke, Im not really sure how comfortable I would be sitting there while he smokes - what can I do to occupy myself and ignore the smell of the evil cig? I don't really want to give up chatting to dad!

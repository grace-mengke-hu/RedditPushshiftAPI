4 years

I quit smoking 4 years ago after about 25 years of smoking.  My brain tricked me and said oh you can have one every now and then.  It doesn't work like that.  Before I knew it I was back to half a pack a day or more.  Using patches again, second day with no smoking.  It's hard, but I can do it.  Smoking is nasty and expensive and it just kills you.  Have to keep reminding myself of that.  Stay strong everyone.

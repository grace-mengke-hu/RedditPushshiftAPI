Damn You Cravings! Damn Each & Every One of You!

Day 5.  It started this morning with the brief thought of, "buy a pack and smoke ONE on the way into work"... I remind myself how I flushed $11 down the toilet by destroying a pack on Thanksgiving Day... apparently, my addicted mind wants to ignore that event...

I'm struggling right now.  I have been brain-washing myself with all the positives.  Honestly, I don't even WANT one, but I WANT one, if you know what I mean?  It's almost like the self-sabotaging part of me is well, trying to self-sabotage... and it's freaking pouring out there- I'm warm & toasty inside and my addiction wants me standing outside like an idiot!

In only 5 days, I'm seeing tremendous benefits and if anyone is around to yell at me and cuss my ass out, I'd appreciate it (don't be shy, even though I'm an older female, I can handle it)...

I'm just gonna sit here at work and eat my pizza and sulk...

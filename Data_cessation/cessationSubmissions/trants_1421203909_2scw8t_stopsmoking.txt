Quitting again... (Chantix)

On my 7th day of chantix right now- stopping tomorrow when i go into the full 1mg twice a day 

Pretty much feel like crap and the cigs taste like crap haha

I did go buy a vaper- no NIC flavors- is that considered cheating?

Also- Last time i quit- i gained like 20lbs in a month. ugh
I think i should at least hit the tread mill and go for walk for 30mins?

tldr; what kind of foods is best to snack on and how much would be a good starting point to exercise?

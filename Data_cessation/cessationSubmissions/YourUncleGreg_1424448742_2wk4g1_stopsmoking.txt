What do I do this weekend?

Hey everyone.  This is my second day without cigarettes.  In your guys' experience what is the best thing to do with yourself the first couple days/weekend to make time pass by faster and make things less miserable.  Will I have a good time going out with my friends drinking this weekend or should I consider staying in bed and watching netflix all weekend.

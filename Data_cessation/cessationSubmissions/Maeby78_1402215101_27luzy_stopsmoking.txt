Drinking and smoking, what no one told me!

They told me that it would be hard to stay off cigarettes when I was drinking.  I was worried.   

Meanwhile, I can smell *everything*!  I amazed by how much I can smell and taste the tiniest of things.  I rolled the window down today in my car, not to let out smoke, but because I could actually smell the freaking HoneySuckle everyone is talking about! 

Tonight, Saturday night, my manager poured me a "good job at work tonight" shot of my usual Jim Beam.  I've been drinking shots of it for years, each one followed by a smoke.  It's my go-to-shot that goes down like water.  10+ shots on a drinking night, each one followed by a Newport or two.  Or three. 

I was worried that I would instantly crave a cigarette after, but it didn't get that far after I took that shot.  

Oh My God!  The shot I've always called home, now tasted like burning hell!  The smell alone was repugnant!  My newfound super ability to smell and taste has rendered Bourbon ineffective!  

I thought drinking was going to make me smoke more.  Turns out, *not* smoking might make me drink less.

Today is the day.

I've been making excuses, and today is the day. I'm quitting tobacco, marijuana, and Mountain Dew today. 

It's the point where I do nothing in my house but smoke weed, cigarettes, and drink Mountain Dew all day. I've let myself get to 315lbs with no job. I smoke a pack a day of cigarettes, a eighth-ounce of weed, and drink 1-2 two-liters of Mountain Dew a day. I'm a full time student who does part-time work for my Dad to survive, and I've made supporting my habits my only purpose.

I've removed all people from my life except my girlfriend, isolated myself to do drugs and play video games, and have been doing so for the last 3 years. It's pathetic and it's time for a change. 

Today that ends. 

I have a SO that I've been with for 4 years, who has developed concern with my wheezing, and my weight. For her, and ultimately myself, I will do this starting today.

This will also allow me to try to find real work, for I will be able to pass a drug test- this above all else is the most important.

I will be keeping picture journey of this as I go along with losing weight. 

I just wanted to post this as a BEFORE kind of thing- and in hopes of getting additional supportive messages should I feel weak and turn to read this.

Thank you guys for all your support.

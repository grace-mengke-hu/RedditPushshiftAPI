20 days and then I caved :(

I went drinking and ended up smoking.  I got the smokes wet.  Really disappointed in myself and really hungover.  Reset the badge this am.  Hate that I'm going to go through withdrawals all over again.


Edit: Wow, lots of good advice.  Thanks all for helping me pick up the pieces. Today was a good day, dealt with a stressful family situation around lots of smokers, no problem.  Thanks everyone.

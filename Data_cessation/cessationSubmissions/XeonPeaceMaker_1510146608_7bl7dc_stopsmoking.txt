Dunhills to 6mg vaping

Ok quick bio
I'm Kevin. I am 27, 6'8" and have been previously smoking for about 5 years. The first two weeks of vaping was the hardest. I coughed up stuff that was horrible. Disgusting tasting flem almost. But I went through it. I started on 6 mg of nicotine on the vape. Now down to 3mg in about a month. I hadn't had a cigarette in the same amount of time. Can't stand the smell anymore either. Is that normal?
Back to the post. I feel amazing. I can breathe again, I can taste again. And perhaps there in lies the problem. I've gained weight. Like a lot 40 lbs almost. Any tips for that?

Thanks
Xeon

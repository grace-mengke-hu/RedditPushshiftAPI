I feel fucking GREAT!

Really.  I do.  Been raging the gym so much harder lately.  My energy is up.  I even started the cardio this week.  

You know when the last time I ran a mile was?

I'm asking if you know.  Cuz I have no fucking idea.

I. Got. This. Shit.

I may still think about the smokes sometimes (More often than I'd care to admit).

But it's different this time.  I'm not fixated.  I'm not just using willpower to hold out.  

I'm rewiring my brain motherfucker.  You got me?  

This shit is Crazy.  I've finally got it.  I finally want to be a non smoker.

After 11 or so years and 7 or so half assed quit attempts. 

I'm done.  I don't want it.  I don't need it.

And as the title of this post says, 'I FEEL FUCKING GREAT!'

Like I can take over the whole god damned world and nobody can stop me.

Next stop on the agenda, get some legislation going to make Obama re read 1984 and write a book report on it.  Because clearly he did not get the message the first time around.  To him it seems to be an instruction manual.

Choo Choo!  White House... here I come!

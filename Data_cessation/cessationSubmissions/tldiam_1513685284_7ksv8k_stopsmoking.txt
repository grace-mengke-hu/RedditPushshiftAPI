I found the method of quitting for good.

Yes, my badge isn’t high, but I haven 0 withdrawals/cravings. here’s why:  

Imagine you and you friend committed a crime, you’ve  stolen 100$ from the gas station. The police caught you and now you are in custody for at least 24 Hours, you really don’t know when you out and how much time you got it. Now you are smokers and your friend is not. You are NOT ALLOWED to smoke at all during custody.

How does it make you feel? Trapped in the a hole in the ground 100 m tall with no way to exit it right? Well that’s what happen to all of us who smoke, this is how we live our lives, in a 100m hole in the ground with the only light in the top. And the only way out to climb Out is to quit nicotine.

Every time I imagine this situation I got this terrified feeling of what smoking does to me, And believe me, if you find yourself in a craving, just imagine it, And imagine it like it is really happening, and I assure you, you will won’t want to smoke.

Best of luck guys!

Note* this method keep me of weed for a week also, 0 craving/withdrawals.

I was doing so good :(

I was doing good with quitting smoking! I stopped smoking at all the “normal times” like at work or after eating and the only time I smoked was when playing Xbox but after some reason health issues and anxiety I started back up again regularly and ugh it sucks! 

But if i did so well before, I know I can do it again! Just so frustrating!

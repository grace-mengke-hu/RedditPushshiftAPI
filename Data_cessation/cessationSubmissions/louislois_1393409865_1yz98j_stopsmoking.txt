Almost a week into my quit and I've lost my voice :(

Around day two after quitting I started coughing up phlegm.  I know this is a good sign that the cilia in my lungs are becoming active again/growing back.  However, the coughing has continued for five straight days, and has gotten so severe, I lost my voice today.  My throat feels completely raw from so much coughing.  I had to call in (well, texted) sick to work, and will probably do the same tomorrow.  I hate having to take time off from work, especially when I'm not genuinely sick, but just suffering from nicotine withdrawal...

Has anyone else experienced severe cough the first week of quitting?  How long until the coughing stopped and your throat healed?

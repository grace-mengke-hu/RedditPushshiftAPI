Suggestion: lets get angry with something together.

I feel reaaaaally angry today and seems I can find flaws in every single little things. I need to be calm for the work. So its like two things streching my brain and heart.

And I thought Why not get angry together to something irrelevant? Like polar bear or Neptune, which doesn't affend anyone.

But I feel silly to do it on my own... So anyone interested?

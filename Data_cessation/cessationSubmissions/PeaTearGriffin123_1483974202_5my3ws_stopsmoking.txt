I'm vaping to quit smoking. Need advice.

On Saturday I got my first e-cig, a Kangertech subvod, and I am using 4mg juice. Yesterday, I was vaping every time I went out for a "smoke break", and I had about 4 hits of a cigarette every other break, just to ease into it. I felt pretty good for most of the day. Well, I don't know if I jumped in too quickly or what, but I had a pretty bad panic attack yesterday evening (even though my anxiey and panic disorder has been under much better control lately), so I decided to have a half cigarette, and I felt much better. Any advice about switching from smoking to vaping? Having a panic attack about this is/was really discouraging. I also get low blood sugar if I don't eat enough. I know quitting makes your appetite stronger, so maybe I just need to eat more?

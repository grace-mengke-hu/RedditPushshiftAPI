18 hours in without a cigarette

Been smoking for years, started when I was 22 when I wanted to join my friends on smoke breaks. Quit for a couple years after grad school, but got sucked back in due to going with friends on a Road Trip. Easiest way to fall back into old habits. So for the past year haven't inhaled (treated cigarettes like cigars) and now I'm 18 hours into going cold turkey. (9 of those hours being asleep last night helped)

I'm in the middle of the cold, clammy, shivery can't focus, eyes watering, drippy nose mode of the cold turkey process. If I can make it to 10:30 EST on Saturday, it'll have been 72 hours and from what I remember, that's the worst of the storm.

Just checking in and to everyone else, hang in there! It's tough, I've relapsed before, but you have to keep trying.

EDIT: I made it past 72 hours. Huzzah!

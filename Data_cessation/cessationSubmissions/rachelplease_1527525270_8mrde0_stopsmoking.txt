Help on getting me and my family to stop smoking

My family has always smoked. I started occasionally when I was 18, I’m 22 now. I moved out two years ago and pretty much stopped since I wasn’t around any other smokers. I just recently moved back in temporarily, and I’ve picked up the habit again more frequently, about a pack or so every two week but that is too much for me. I really want to stop, but it’s difficult when I’m with my family and they’re smoking, I just want to light up too.

Any tips on stopping while I’m around them, or better yet helping my family quit the habit as well? We all want to stop and both my parents have tried numerous times but end up falling back into the habit. We all want to live a healthier lifestyle but every time we try it never sticks. I’ve noticed my throat hurts more since moving back and I’ve been getting headaches, and I absolutely hate the smell of smoke in the house even though we smoke outside, it travels in. Any advice is welcome! Thank you in advance!

My experience with trying to quit

Hello guys, 

I have tried and tried numerous times to quit, but always my streak breaks, mainly because of my friends. Meeting them though only twice, may be thrice a month, is like an stress buster for me. We just hang out, talk about stuff over smokes, eat some of our favorite foods and just chill.

I am JUST not able to bring myself to pass up on this cool opportunity to hang out with them and chilling over smokes. To be honest, I love it. 

Even though I know smoking is at the root of everything that is wrong with my life right now, I cannot belive how my mind tricks itself to give in to the urge and ignore my "100%" will to quit, of just a few hours or days ago. How the hell is it so easy to give in and ruin everything that you thought for yourself. 


I know it will take iron will to stay quit even while doing what you love with smoker friends. But i am not able to do HAVE that will in me, and I'm afraid I never will. Because I don't have discipline, none whatsoever and I have the willingness to be disciplined but no will power to do it.

It's not like that I have not tried. I have. I have been through r/thexeffect, r/getdisciplined etc, I have practised mindfulness meditation, kept a journal, built time tables for myself and on and on.. But every single time I have left the practice in between, broken every rule that I set for myself and have been back to the ground zero because I give into the temptation VERY VERY easily. No self control! 

Self control i what I seek and I don't know how to cultivate it. /rant


I feel like I need some devine intervention :(

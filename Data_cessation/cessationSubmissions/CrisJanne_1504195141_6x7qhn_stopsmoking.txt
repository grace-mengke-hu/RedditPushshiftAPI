Where are you, month quitters?

Hi there community! Last days have been hard! A lot of things going on, new work place, new house and almost old boyfriend 😑😑 don't know why but I don't really think about cigs when things go down, it's when I stop to breathe that I think that maybe one day I will cave... well, my question  is about this forum, I came here to fix my thoughts and I only find newbies! I love people who are quitting ( be strong!! ) but I think that once we get more confident we stop coming here and that's a mistake... we are not safe yet 🙄😁😎

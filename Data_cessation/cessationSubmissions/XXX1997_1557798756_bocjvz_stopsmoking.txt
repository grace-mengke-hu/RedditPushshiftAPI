Does dip help you quit smoking?

I found a can of dip the other day and have been trying it out and am thinking of switching to dip to get my nicotine fix until I can fully quit. I've spent soo much money on vapes trying to switch to that but I always end up smoking again because of the sensation of inhaling. Has anyone used dip before to quit cigs? 

(I know its just as bad for you)

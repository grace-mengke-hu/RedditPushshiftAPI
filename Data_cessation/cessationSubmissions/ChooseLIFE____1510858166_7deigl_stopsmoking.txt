Tried so many times and the logic just won't sink in.

It sucks when you consider yourself a fairly logical person and the reality just won't sink in.

I've read Easy Way 4 times and about to listen for a 5th.  Snacks and Vape just in case. Working out and walking when the cravings get rough. And for the last week I've been buying packs, smoking a few, and destroying the rest.  BUT... then by the end of the day I freak and binge on like 20+ in a manner of hours. 

I haven't gone 24 hours in without a cigarette in over 15 years.  And I really want today to be the day.  I almost in tears writing this.  I want this so badly.

FUCK FUCK FUCK!!!

I FORGOT TO MAKE THE MANDATORY "1 WEEK!!:D" POST :(
(admit it i got u worrying right there for a second :P)
so here you go :D
uuuhhmm..... I'm feeling fine i guess. no real changes in my lifestyle whatsoever. just more tea than before.
(WARNING: long read ahead but its important to me)
and now to the important stuff: recently someone posted on this subreddit that he's going to quit by completely changing up his routine and a lot of you guys were objecting and saying that he's setting himself up for failure by doing this because most people that stop out of a change in routine mostly get back to smoking when the routine is back. The thing is, thats exactly whats happening here with me. Im in a country Ive never been to before without knowing anyone for 6 months. so I thought i must as well just stop smoking while I'm here and all my smoker friends and family aren't around which worked fine so far. Now I'm worried that ill just start smoking again the moment I'm back home. any ideas on this?

EDIT: sry for the formatting I'm reddit stupid

Nearly 24 hours; I feel alright, but most of all I SMELL AWESOME!

I think I'm doing okay! I haven't had to interact with people much yet today, but my head is a bit cloudy. Just a tad difficult to keep focused on whatever it is that I'm doing.

I had my morning coffee without a smoke which made me feel good. Coffee without cigarettes is quite a challenge. They go hand in hand! Well.. not anymore! :P

I'm actually in a really good mood. I've been reminding myself of all the positive things that come with not smoking everytime I think of having one. That, and like the title says, I smell amazing. I can still smell the perfume I put on this morning. I made sure to wear my favorite as a sweet reminder of how much better off I am now that I don't smell, body and breath!

I'm positive, with how good I feel, that this is the last time I quit.

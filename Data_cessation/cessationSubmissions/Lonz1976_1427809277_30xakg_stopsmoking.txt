Want to share my diary entry

Day 38 Got myself some replacement cartridges 3 for Â£6, any situation social, frustration, relaxation I have my electric cig I don't feel so lost or empty, I know it not the same as real cigs but starting to forget what real cigs are, the habit is now vapour not tobacco, I even realise I using my e cig less and less now, I still feel happy and my kids are so proud of me, 

I been reading posts on here since smoke free sent me here on day 5, I not posted before because I couldn't decide what to say but I realised it not what you say it how you feel, I feel happy and proud of myself when I never thought I would get this far. I feel that I never need tobacco again for the rest of my life I hope sharing my feelings can give hope and confidence to others

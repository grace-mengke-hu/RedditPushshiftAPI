55 Days smoke free

I am now 55 days smoke free after smoking for ~20 years. Sunday I noticed an issue, well actually I noticed before, but decided to do something about it Sunday. Since I quit I have really started to drink more, so I stopped drinking too. I don't plan to quit drinking forever, just for a couple of weeks, and then only be able to drink on a Friday, saturday, or sunday. That has made the past 3 days harder to not smoke, but is definitely easier today. I am not trading in one habit for another!

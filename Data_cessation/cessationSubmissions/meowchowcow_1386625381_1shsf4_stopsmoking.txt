Achieved 36 days quiting cold turkey, but Ive noticed my drinking as increased...

Hello everyone,
Im not sure if this happened to anyone else but since I quit smoking over a month ago, I noticed I've been drinking and smoking pot a lot more. 
Before, I would take many little breaks during work to go outside to smoke a cig. For the past two weeks, Ive been going out to lunch to have a few beers and come back :( I have this strange urge during those times, and I guess drinking is replacing my cigarette breaks?
Im scared my drinking will become a problem and replace cigs :( anyone have advice or been through something similar? 
The pot is reserved for night-time only and thats not a huge concern for me at the moment but ive never drank during work before....how can I replace cigs with something healthier? At work I have urges to drink and at home I want to smoke pot all night. Before, I would smoke a bowl and have a few cigs. Now I smoke multiple bowls a night, as if they're numerous cigs. I dont know what to do to replace all these bad habits and I dont want to smoke cigs again....

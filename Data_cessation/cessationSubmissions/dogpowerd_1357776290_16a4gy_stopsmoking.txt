A question about the electronic cigarette and NRTs.

So I wanted to get you guy's opinion on something. I quit smoking in march last year. I have not touched a traditional cigarette since then and I hope I will never again in my life HOWEVER I have been using nicotine lozenges since then usually buying a pack a week. I have tried to quit the lozenges a few times and each time it has gone horribly the last time I tried I started craving cigarette for the first time in months. I rationalized this decision thinking that even though being addicted to nicotine is bad at least it kept me from going back to smoking. 

In the last few days I have switched from the lozenges to an e cig reasoning that if i was going to continue using nicotine this was a more efficient and cheap way of doing so. Is this cheating?  If so I request that the mods remove my badge. I can't help but feel guilty and disingenuous having a 304 days badge while still being very much addicted to nicotine. Thank you for reading.

I smoked my first pack in 5 months

I quit late July 2018. No cigarettes. Absolutely none. Came close a few times but i was strong. I got a pack a few days ago and have 2 smokes left. This shit is a life long battle. I am amazed that some people just dont have this terrible addiction. Like some people have just never smoked and never will. Wow. I've done this to myself. Is it now part of my personality? Just being an addict. People say they've quit for 20 years but still crave. I can believe that because those 5 months had some awful days of craving. Gotta find pleasure somewhere...

Very tough day.

I just had to put my put my dog down.  He had cancer and was in a lot of pain.  I loved him so much.  Very hard for me right now to not reach for a smoke.  My wife still smokes, so they are in the house.  I am resisting, but it's hard.  I figure, if I get through this, I'll really be on my way.  Thanks for the support everyone.

Cleaning just to clean....

The amount of boredom I'm feeling from not smoking is driving me insane lol I'm for once cleaning up my room out of boredom... I guess it is nice because things will be cleaner around here.... My body is screaming at me to smoke/vape,, but thinking back to when I was doing it ALL the time I felt so stupid... so I'm on day 3 now.. hopefully I can pull through, Not one puff needs to be taken to heart for me lol

I passed 100 daysâ€¦

One week ago I was celebrating: 100 days smoke-free and 1000 cigarettes not smoked, thanks to the "Smoke free" app and you.

I even managed to overcome the session of exams in my university and a love disappointment without having a puff. My "not one more puff" mantra works really good.

I feel very happy for my achievements, everyone is proud of me for what I am doing.

But I am afraid I'll start again from day 1 before september. My friends at the beach use to smoke a lot, expecially one, and I always remember the great times spent with a cigarette in my hand. For now I'm standing, I discovered I can even afford drinking without risks for my freedom as whenever I get this desire, even if half-drunk, I hear the voice "not a puff, not a puff, not a puff" and I immediately repeat it.
My fear is this mantra will not be enough to stand. I don't want to be alone in order not to risk, but sometimes my cravings are tougher. I am afraid to cave in.

4 weeks smoke free

Today I am proud to be a non-smoker. I thought things would be easier after 3 weeks, but my cravings have really been getting more intense lately. Going on bike rides up the canyon has been my escape over these past few weeks. It feels so good to have my breath back.

Stay strong, everybody! Let's crush this addiction!

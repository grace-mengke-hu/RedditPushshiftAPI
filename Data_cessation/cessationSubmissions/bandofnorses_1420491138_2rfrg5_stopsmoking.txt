40 days in and cannot get over stomach issues...

So, long story short, I quit smoking about forty days ago. I have been having some pretty serious problems with my stomach ranging from constipation and nausea in the beginning weeks to stomach cramps and acid reflux as of the last two weeks. I have visited a gastroenterologist who is looking at the possibility of Celiac's Disease and I am holding off on the lower GI test of a colonoscopy. I was wondering if anyone has had prolonged stomach issues even after the first month. I only smoked for a year and at most 6 cigarettes a day. I am about to leave the country in 11 days for six months and need to get this figured out before I go. I don't have any constipation anymore. I am fairly regulated in that half. I have been told that my stomach underwent a shock during my quitting process and now I have to give it time to reset. I've been eating right and getting out, but my acid and bloating still persists. I really cannot eat portions I was once use to eating anymore. Thus, I have lost about 20 pounds since I quit. I don't know what I should do, so I was just looking for some advice and see if anyone else dealt with the same issues. Good luck in your battle and I appreciate the help.

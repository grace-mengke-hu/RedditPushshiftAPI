Fell off the wagon after a 1 year quit... Day one again.

I've quit opiates, lost 90 pounds, quit smoking for a year, got my Brazilian Jiu Jitsu blue belt, made sergeant at work, but now I've started lighting up again and I feel like the inner "hard me" that was inside me fueling my discipline has left.  I'm inside my head about it, I feel like I can't trust myself.  Anyway, today is day one again.  I hope halfway through my shift I don't find myself almost unconsciously walking around looking for someone to bum a cigarette from.  I hope I can fight through the anxiety.  Thanks guys.

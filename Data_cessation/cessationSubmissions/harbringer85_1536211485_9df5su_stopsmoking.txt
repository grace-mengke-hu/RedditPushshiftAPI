About to snap

I’m 2 days in. I’ve tried quitting once before and failed. My mom started me smoking when I was 9. She would buy me packs. I’d smoke a cig on the walk to and from elementary school and would sneak them at recess. It feels like I never had a choice but now I have to go through this hell to quit. My husband is quitting with me - he didn’t start until he was 17 and it was his choice. It seems like he isn’t even bothered by not smoking. Meanwhile, I feel like I’m dying. I’m constantly reading articles and practicing all these methods to get through cravings. My skin is crawling and I want to punch someone. I want to go punch my abusive cunt of a mother for setting me up for this hell. I’m so tempted to just say fuck it and buy a pack until my doctors appointment and I can get some kind of help with quitting.

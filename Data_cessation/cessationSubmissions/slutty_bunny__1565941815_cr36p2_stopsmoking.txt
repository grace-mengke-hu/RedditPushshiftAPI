Does quitting vaping count too?

Damn I’m so ready to kick nicotine. I don’t smoke cigarettes anymore so I guess it’s a start. But in all reality, vaping is just as bad. I hate it. I hate running low on juice, taking the time to buy it, spending the money.. it all just sucks. 

If you guys could please give me some tips that worked for you to quit (especially the self talk you used to push through the cravings) that would help so much. I’m going to use the last of what I got and then give quitting another try.

You know what’s really pushing me to quit? It might sound silly to some but I’m starting to get wrinkles on my face from the nicotine use. I’m 25. I shouldn’t have wrinkles on my face yet! Also just thinking about how nicotine constricts my blood vessels creeps me out. It’s time to quit this pointless habit!

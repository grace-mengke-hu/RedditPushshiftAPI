Two years tobacco free!

Yesterday was my second year without a cigarette. It's even hard to believe I spent 20 years smoking now. I have almost no cravings for cigarettes anymore, maybe twice in the past 6 months and they were more like brief thoughts than actual cravings. I quit drinking 4 1/2 years ago and still have strong cravings for an ice cold Guinness, I was worried cigarettes were going to be like that too. Anyways, I'm glad I quit and if you are in the process it does get easier! Good luck to all!

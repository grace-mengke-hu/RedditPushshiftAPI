I am really scared...

August 5th is my quit date. I've done it before, cold turkey a half year. Now I'm ready to quit again this time for sure, but I keep asking myself - will this make me a different person?  I use cigarettes as a means to step away from the crowd, and reorient myself. I'm not the most social guy, and stepping away from the crowd for a bit helps me reorient myself. Has anyone else faced the same situation? How do you step away from/reorient yourself in groups/crowds?

It has been a week of "quitting". I came home to my parents to take care of mom. Haven't smoked for 4 days. But I haven't exerted any will power. So this quit doesn't feel real.

I want to continue being a non-smoker when I return to work in a couple of days. I am terrified that without my family's strict eye I will fall into this habit. I don't want to, but like I said this imposed quit doesn't feel real. Any help?

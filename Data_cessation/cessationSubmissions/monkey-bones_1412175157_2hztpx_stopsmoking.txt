Hit the 1 year mark

Look at that nice little smiling star! Welp Awesome awesome awesome. I had never been a very big time smoker but the first few times i had tried to quit always ended up back doing it again. My boy Allan Carr hooked up the knowledge this time around and it did help me out big time. As did the many of you here so thanks to you all. Whether it was reading about people that had been quit saying "i want that" or reading new peoples struggles and saying "i remember that and look how far i've come" this sub was a big help.

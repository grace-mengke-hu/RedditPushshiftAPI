My friend tried to commit....

I’m at 27 days, had to stop my closest friend from taking a bottle of oxys. He was on day 25. He smoked half a pack  and has left me with the rest. It’s hard. Still no cave. I am so scared in every way. What have you done in an over the top situation since you’ve quit?

Can’t stop nicorette

Hey all. New to this group. I’ve quit smoking solidly for 6 months. I’ve used the gum off and on throughout the years and have never been able to quit. I actually think the gum is more difficult than actual smoking. Does anyone have suggestions to quit Nicotine gum? When I quit, the withdrawal is insane and I just feel like some part of me is missing.

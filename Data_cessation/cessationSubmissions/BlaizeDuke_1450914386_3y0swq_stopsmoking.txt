Is there a general tips for quitting post for this sub?

I looked on the sidebar on mobile and didn't see anything. My dad has offered me a substantial amount of money if I quit for 2 years (his 2 years is up in february) and that starts Jan 11. 

I know the money is gonna help but I was hoping to find any and everything that makes it easier. So if there is a post I could read could someone please link it.

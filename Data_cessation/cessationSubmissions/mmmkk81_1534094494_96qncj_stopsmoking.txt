Nasal congestion and smoking

Has anyone ever got sinus congestion when they were smoking? I’ve been getting this recently and originally thought it was an nfection, but doc said it’s from smoking, sometimes it’s brutal, sometimes not too bad. It’s just hard to accept that smoking is causing it! I plan to quit soon because it flat out sucks. Anyone ever experience this?

Venting a bit

Hey there,

I've relapsed after 12 days, wanted to smoke, smoked a few with a friend. Now I'm back to soberness with something new in mind, because I've discovered that my mind has already shifted my default behaviour to non smoker, as I see smoking as something definitely non natural. And for someone who smoked 11 years, that's a big step. Anyway, I'm back with you all for GOOD this time !

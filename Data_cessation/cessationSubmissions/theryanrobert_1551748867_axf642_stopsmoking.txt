I ending up having one... but

Throughout the last 34 days since quitting, I’ve been hit with several stressful situations that’s made me crave a cigarette.. this morning I had terrible anxiety for no reason, and it let up over time today.. 

A half hour ago I decided to have a cigarette only because when I quit three years ago, I ended up having only one to intentionally make me sick so I can stop having cravings..

Tonight was exactly like that.. to make me intentionally sick, and I’m really sick right now.. it reassured me that I don’t want to smoke ever again, that it’s nasty.

I myself told people on here that it doesn’t reset your clock, but when it comes to me I’m having a hard time believing it even though I know it doesn’t.. this one cigarette is not going to take three days for the nicotine to leave my body right? I won’t be addicted right? Even though I know these answers, I just need assurance please :(

Make a decision...

Stop saying that you are "trying" to quit. It's a binary decision. 
You either quit or you didn't. 

Stop saying you are quitting. That makes it sound like it's a process that takes a period of time to complete. 
You either quit or you didn't. 

Stop talking about how you quit last time or this time. You can only quit once. 
You either quit or you didn't. 

So when someone asks if you want to go have a cigarette, you give them a smile and say...No thanks. I quit.

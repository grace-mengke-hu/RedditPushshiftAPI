I quit. I don't like this job.

Did my last shift at a gas station. I already took 2 days off, but I somehow had to take a few more. I quit at the next gas station. I don't like this job. It's making me sick and exhausted, it's beneath me.

Now, I am quitting for good. My only job from now on will be to supply oxygen. I want to excel at that job, so please train me and use me a lot. But never disrespect me by letting me do that other job one more time.

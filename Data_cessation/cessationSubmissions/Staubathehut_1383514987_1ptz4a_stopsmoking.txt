Having a few drinks made me ruin my 3 week streak...

So I have been lurking this subreddit for quite a while because quitting smoking has been something that I've always wanted to do. I regret ever starting in the first place but now I have been a smoker for about 8 years. I started smoking in college during periods of heavy drinking. It kinda kicked my buzz up a notch. It didn't take long for me to develop a pack a day habit. 

I recently moved to a new city, and I don't know anyone so I decided to try and quit smoking, and I was doing pretty well with the cold turkey approach. But I went out drinking to try and meet people, and after a few drinks I walked across the street and bought a pack. I've smoked 4 cigarettes in 5 days. I just had one a few minutes and felt compelled to post this. I feel like shit. Does anyone have advice for not caving after a few drinks? I know I could just quit drinking, but I enjoy socially drinking and would like to do one without the other. I just don't think that I have the self control to be a social smoker. Not after having been a pack a day smoker for 8 years. Any tips for staying strong while drinking? Now I have a pack sitting in my car and it is all I can think about.

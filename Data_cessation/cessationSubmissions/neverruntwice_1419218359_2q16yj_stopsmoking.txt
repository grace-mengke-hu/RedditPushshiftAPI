Think I am ready to quit

So I've been smoking for about 10 years.  I've been thinking about quitting for about a month now and finally decided that I am ready to stop after this weekend.  

I've tried in the past but have failed.  I do okay for a while but breakdown when I'm bored.  This gets especially bad when I'm driving, I fear thats going to be my biggest hurdle. 

I know its going to be tough but I can do it.

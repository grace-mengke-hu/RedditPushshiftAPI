Two days in, I had a cig. I feel like shit now.

After eight years (avg a pack a day) I've decided to stop smoking. Friday night I extinguished what I hoped to be my last cigarette. The weekend was like a nightmare, but managed not to kill anyone. I even headed out to the gas station to buy a pack last night, but by the time I got there (5 mins walk) I've changed my mind. This afternoon I couln't bear the cravings anymore. I bought a pack, smoked a cig. It tasted bad (to a surprise to me), and i didn't enjoy it at all. I thought it would be a relief of some kind, but it was the complete opposite. Nevertheless, I finished that cigarette and gave away the pack to a stranger (maybe I should've just trash it...) I decided not to give up. I'm not a quitter ;) Next time, when I feel I just can't take it anymore without a cigarette, I'll try to remember how bad this one was, the worst in my life. Hopefully it'll keep me from failing again.

To the upside, I was afraid of having coffee, because I always had it with a cigarette. Agaist all odds, I didn't miss the smokes at all.

My biggest problem turned out to be the lack of concentration. Trying to work on my projects here, and  until now, when I got stuck on a problem I went out to have a cig and pondered on the problem, and eventually came up with a solution, and continued working. Now I can't get my mind off the smokes. I'm just sitting here in front of my computer, try to work, but going crazy instead. Any advice?

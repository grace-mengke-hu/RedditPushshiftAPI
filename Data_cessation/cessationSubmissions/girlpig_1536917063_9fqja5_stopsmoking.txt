Panic attacks

has anyone with panic disorder tried to quit smoking? I've had panic attacks for 4 years now, really often. been smoking for 5 years (i think). i got a lot better and now over the past couple of months i've been having trouble breathing which causes me to have a panic attack, i think this is due to smoking and also anxiety. i tried going jogging a little while ago and when i got to the top of a hill i literally couldn't breathe, started panicking and had to sit on the ground, i was honestly gasping for air. i think being scared of the shortness of breath is finally the motivation i really need to quit. I tried to quit earlier this year using nicotine patches but had a horrible reaction to the material they use on them so i would have to do it cold turkey. does anyone have experience with panic attacks and quitting?

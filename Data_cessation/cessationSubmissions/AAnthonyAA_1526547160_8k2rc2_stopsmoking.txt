I can't believe what came out of me when I woke up today!!!!

Seriously, I have just thrown up a belly full.  A freaking stomach full of mucus/phlegm.  After 19 days now smoke free I can still feel these horrible little monsters wriggling out of me.  I have peeled at a pimple on my forehead and demanded a raise from my boss in the same week.  This is probuably the most traumatic experience I can imagine.  Hopefully it will be enough to remind me.   

Wonderful to be here.

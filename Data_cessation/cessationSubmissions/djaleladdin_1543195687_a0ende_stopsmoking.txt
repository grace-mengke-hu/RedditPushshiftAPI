Time to start again , time to be free again

Hello everyone , am starting the challenge  all over again , I ve been smoking for almost ,3 years now and I can't even recognize myself anymore , smoking a pack per day can really be a self destroying especielly with anxiety so i made a promise to myself to quit starting from now and start doing some exercises to get over this addiction , I hope I will be able to do it , and good luck to you everybody ,

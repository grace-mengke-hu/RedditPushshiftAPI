9 years smoke-free, and I blew it

I have postpartum depression and panic attacks. The week of Easter was so stressful that I went of the deep end and did something I swore I'd never do again. I bought a pack of cigarettes and smoked one right there in the parking lot. 

I confessed to my husband, who threw the pack away. Later, I stole it out of the trash can and I've been sneaking one or two a day. This is a nightmare.

I don't know how anyone can, but...please help.

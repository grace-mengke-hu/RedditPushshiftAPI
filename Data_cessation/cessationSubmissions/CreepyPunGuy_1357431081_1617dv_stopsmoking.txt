Your favorite realization as an official ex-smoker

I've made it past 75 days, without many cravings, so I'll share my favorite realization I made as an ex-smoker (non-smoker):

-I've beaten this monster that has plagued my fathers, and my grandfathers. I've gotten past something that has limited the men in my family for generations. Hoorah!

Those of you who've made it, or even if you're just starting, what is/will be YOUR favorite realization as an official ex-smoker?

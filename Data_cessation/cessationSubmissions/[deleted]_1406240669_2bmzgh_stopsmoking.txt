Day 4 and still no cravings?

Alright so I've been a smoker for probably four years now and have tried to quit multiple times before. Just recently I've finally motivated myself to do it for real this time. For reference, I smoked half a pack of Camel Menthols a day.

So it's now day 4 and I have not once felt an intense craving or need for a cigarette.  Is it normal for some people to quit this easily? Was I less addicted to nicotine then others?

  Everyday at work, I go to my car for break and I can see and smell everyone smoking outside but I still get no urge. Although, the weekend will be the true test when I hang out with my smoker friends.

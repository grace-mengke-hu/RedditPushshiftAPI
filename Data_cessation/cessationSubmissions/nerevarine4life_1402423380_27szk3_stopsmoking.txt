Started when I was 12. Quit for almost two years and started again.

I really want to quit for good, but my triggers are stress and depression. Just moved out of the house my ex and I lived in. New town, no friends, no money, started again. 

I read rave reviews on Alan Carr's book, but when I went to purchase it from amazon I decided to peak at the one star reviews. There's a lot of, what appears to be; well deserved criticism. 

I'm almost 23 and while I've been good at throwing away the last cigarette and going a day or two without any; I always end up smoking again. Last time was cold turkey and I had a good support system. This time I don't

Any advice?

conquering the dream smoke

So last night I had another dream where I smoked. I have been having them for the last 4 days. But last night's was different.

After smoking in my dream I looked down at the pack I had and there was about 15 left in it(I think, dreams are weird). But this time I did something that didn't happen in any of the other smoking dreams...I TOOK OUT ALL THE SMOKES AND CRUSHED THEM.

All of the people who were with me in my dream were telling me not to break them, but I just took them out of the pack, crushed them into a ball and threw them down...then I woke up feeling great.

I wonder if this is some sort of significant event for my sub-concious mind in the process of quitting...I am feeling quite good this morning.

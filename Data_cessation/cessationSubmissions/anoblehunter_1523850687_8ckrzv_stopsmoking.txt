My first post on any subreddit — EVER

Y’all, I’ve been lurking on various subreddits for years, but I feel like this is important enough to make my first ever official post. I have a pretty addictive personality, so naturally as soon as I picked up smoking when I was 19, I picked it up hard and I’ve been a heavy smoker ever since, smoking between 12-15 cigarettes a day since.  I quit for over roughly 2 months when I had my tonsils removed, but I went right back to smoking after (I may have even started smoking again too early after the surgery).

But today I said enough is enough. At around 6:00 pm today I smoked the last cigarette in my pack and I threw out all of my lighters. I’m going to give myself an early birthday by becoming a non-smoker. I will not let my addiction define my life, or death.

Cravings at 21 Days

I've been without tobacco for 21 days. Before this, I was a pretty heavy hookah smoker. I've never been a cigarette smoker, but the hookah was my thing. I would smoke for three or four hours a day; all of that time just completely wasted. Now, I've been getting outside, being active, reading, spending time with my girlfriend and whatnot. 

Last night, I was driving back home from my parents' place after dropping off my dog to be dog-sat for a week while I go climbing, and I was thinking, "I could really go for some hookah right now."

Here's the thing. I have a [car cup-holder style hookah](http://www.hookah-shisha.com/p-2808-leila-1-hose-portable-hookah.html) and it's been my go-to for road trips since I bought it. It makes it really easy to just smoke in the car while driving.

I contemplated setting it up for my climbing trip this week, and then [this scene from House of Cards popped into my head](http://imgur.com/r/GetMotivated/zTc0MFR). I yelled out "Fuck the zero!", turned up my music, and just kept driving.

**TL;DR - Fuck the zero!**

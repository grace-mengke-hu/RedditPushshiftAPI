I'll never make 1 year! (oh wait!)

Oh wait.. it's been exactly 1 year. All the way around the sun. 

I really don't have too much to say. I've made many a post over the past year for people but at this point I'm just a plain old non-smoker.  I can sit outside with smokers all around and I don't care at all anymore. The year went fast and here I am.. unfortunately a whole year older and not getting any younger :P


To all of you new quitters out there, this is just another reminder.. It's hard now, it's clogging your thoughts, 1 year and total freedom seems ages away.. But it's really not. Just get through the day... It will become a week.. then a month.. 3 months.. 6.. one year.. boom, done, enslavement over. Unfortunately life still whizzes right on by whether or not you smoke.. If quitting smoking made my years last a little longer I'd quit once a month :P (JUST KIDDING!!!)

After 20 years averaging a pack a day.. I'm free. FREE. No more stinky clothes, no more panicking because I'm out of cigarettes at an inopportune time or out of money. No more hacking up a lung, no more chronic fatigue.. 8 hours and I spring out of bed to action. I feel 10 years younger. I feel good. I feel great!



QUIT SMOKING, IT'S THE BEST CHOICE YOU'LL EVER MAKE!!!!

Just had my morning cigarette. I want it to be my last.

I had this bizarre dream last night where my sister had lung cancer. She doesn't even smoke, so I'm not sure what weird twists of my subconscious brought me there or why it's affecting me so much this morning, but I got halfway through my traditional morning cig and threw it away.

I've "quit" more times than I can count, and honestly, just the idea of doing it again gets harder every time, but I really want this to be the last day. Haven't quite brought myself to throw away the half-pack I've got left.

Are most people here cold turkey? E-cig users? Gum or anything else?

EDIT: Ten minutes after posting and reading through the rest of the front page, I snapped the 10 or so I had left. We'll see what happens.

EDIT 2: Thanks for all the suggestions guys. It's encouraging to see people respond like that. I've decided to go the vape route, because in the past my longest runs have always involved vaping. I don't necessarily want to be bound to that forever, either, but I'm going to follow the advice of those who suggested decreasing nic amounts over time. Thanks for all the advice, everybody.

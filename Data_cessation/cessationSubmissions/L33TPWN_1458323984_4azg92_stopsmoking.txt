I've made it 10 days without smoking now! After smoking about 1/2 a pack a day for 7 years, what should I expect when my lungs start to clear out?

I'm more than a week in and I'm going strong. The Nicorette Lozenges are helping me out a lot, but I'm already starting to cut back on those as well. I've started trying to eat healthier and work out occasionally and I'm feeling really good.

I haven't started coughing yet, and I'm a little nervous because I don't know what to expect. What is it going to be like? Is there anything to help ease it once it starts?

This sub is awesome and has already helped the way I think about smoking. Thank you!

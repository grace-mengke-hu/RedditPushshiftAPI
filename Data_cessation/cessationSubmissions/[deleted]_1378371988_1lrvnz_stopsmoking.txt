On Day 2

Heya,
I've been smoking for about 5 years now. It started as a social thing. I wasn't addicted until about a year, when I started smoking 10 a day, and before I knew it life got pretty stressful and a pack a day was completely normal and I fucking loved it.

My whole family smokes, and most my friends do, so it's not an easy environment to quit in. But that doesn't bother me too much. The main thing that gets me is seeing people smoke in movies. That shit always makes me want to smoke.

So yeah, I'm pretty committed now. I'll let you guys know how it goes. Fingers. Fucking. Crossed.

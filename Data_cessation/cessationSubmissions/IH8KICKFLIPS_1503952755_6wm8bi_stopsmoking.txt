Strange possible withdrawal symptoms?

I smoked about a pack a month for 4 years, then a pack a day for 8 months. About a year ago I quit over night through vaping and never had a cigarette again. I've finally decided to call it quits for good and over the past week dialed down my vaping amount to maybe 10% of my usual intake (puff amounts not nic level). Several strange things have been happening since.

Day one: loss of concentration but nothing major.

Day 2: Jaw pain on left side under the hinge and stuffy ear on that side. On a scale of 1-10 I'd say it was a 1 or 2. Swollen nodes.

Day 3: the symptoms above had gone but I found my ears needing to pop consistently. Nodes still slightly swollen. I bought a pack of nicorette gum today and had a few pieces. 

Day 4: good all day until I felt something stuck in my throat. After close examination I couldn't find anything nor did food or drink do anything to it. After a few hours it subsided and hasn't returned. 

Day 5 and 6: Vaping down to zero and 2 pieces of 2mg niccorette. Ears still feel slightly stuffed and head aches but other symptoms seem to have passed.

I've been having horrible anxiety and panic attacks off and on starting day 2. Usually it's a fear of dying or poor health such as cancer developing or a heart attack looming around the corner. Any thoughts or similar experiences?

Edit: I'm 24 male.

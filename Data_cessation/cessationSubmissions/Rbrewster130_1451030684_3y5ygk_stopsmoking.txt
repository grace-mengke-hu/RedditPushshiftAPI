First time poster, advice would be appreciated.

I've been smoking for 7 years (from 16 am now 23) have developed asthma and have been feeling very poor health wise for a few years.

I quit smoking 9 days ago but gave into temptation last night and have had three cigarettes. I feel very guilty but seeing some of the posters on here has been inspiring.

Just looking for advice as I feel I've let myself and others down by having those ciggarttes and just need some advice and perspective. 

Thanks guys, Merry Christmas :)

Day one - Attempt 1,453,213: No smoking

No but seriously, I have tried A LOT, as I'm sure most of you can relate. 
I'm heading into work now, trying to keep my mindset in a "Non smoker" realm. It's so weird and easy at first, but then break time comes and goes, and then lunch....damn it.
After reading Allen Carrs book, my attempts have been bolstered by a new perspective, but failure at each turn has been inevitable no matter how giddy I get about never smoking again.

I don't even know why I buy another pack, but then again, I have come to accept it as the drug addiction it is. It's just so weird to imagine never smoking another cigarette after ten years of doing so. Literally all of my young adult life.

Lend me your spirit energy!

Edit: Failed. This was expected. Boring night at a warehouse where I literally have all the time in the world to smoke, and a book that rapidly dwindled to not enough pages.

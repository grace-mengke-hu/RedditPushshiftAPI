Struggling with cravings so I’m focusing on my next milestone: 170 days

Lately I’ve been reminded a lot of smoking because I’m spending more time with a friend I used to spend hours with smoking outside in the summer. I love hanging out with her and even though she hasn’t smoked in front of me, I’m really afraid I’m going to give in because it would be so easy to go back to shooting the breeze over a smoke with her. 

So I’m going back to basics and I’m focusing on my next milestone: 170 days. I’m really proud of my progress and I know five minutes smoking isn’t worth giving up my days so far. I’ve invested too much in myself. 

Also I’m probably going to have this same conversation with her: I respect your ability to make your own decisions, but I’m asking for your understanding right now so id rather keep our time smoke free. I know that’s kind of an asshole thing to say but I don’t think she’ll mind; she’s an infrequent social smoker and none of our other friends smoke, either. Any thoughts on how to have this conversation with her?

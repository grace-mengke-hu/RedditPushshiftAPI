Day 3 mentality

The standard stuff, cravings are not so bad, physical is OK. But the depression I already had is so much worse. My mind trying to convince me the sky is falling and I don't even really care about my health so why even do this, may as well smoke. 

I will stay strong. I have forced myself into making smoking a choice. A choice I really have no reason to choose. It is literally pointless.

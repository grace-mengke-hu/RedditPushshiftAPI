I gave up

Yesterday morning, I was so happy about making 50th day post. But shit went down yesterday evening, I was working 12hrs+ since so many days. Yesterday I just couldn’t take it. I bought a pack and smoked 3 back to back. I feel ashamed of myself. Good thing was I did not like it or I couldn’t take lotta smoke in either. Should I reset my apps and badges here? I feel so let down, it was not at all easy to reach here. And I gave up everything in a moment.

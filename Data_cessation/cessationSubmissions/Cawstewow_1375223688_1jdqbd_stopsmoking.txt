I can't stop crying, ahhh!

I know that everyone has varying levels of addiction and I am very emotionally attached to my ciggarettes ( never even considered smoking until immediately following my fathers passing six years ago ). I am cutting back on the amount I smoke (usually 16 a day and I'm down to 5) and I cannot stop crying!! It is driving my husband mad.....

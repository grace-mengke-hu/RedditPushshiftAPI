How can I be helpful in my partner's plan to stop smoking?

My boyfriend smokes about two packs a day and has for about 12 years (he's 31 now). He and his roommates recently made a pact to quit, but at two packs a day, he didn't think he'd be able to quit cold turkey without going crazy. I've never been a smoker, and the only addiction I've ever quit was coffee 3 years ago - I went from drinking 4 cups of coffee per day to zero. It was hard for about a month, I couldn't sleep but was exhausted and irritable all the time, but as I understand it, that's really nothing compared to going from two packs a day to zero . . .

So my problem is that I have no idea how to help him. I know myself and I know that moderation is not an option with addictions for me, it's either cold turkey or bust, but I'm well aware that not everyone is like that.

I want to be supportive, but I have no experience in this, and I don't know what to say or do to be helpful.

Today he tried only smoking a cig every hour and a half, but felt super anxious, so switched to smoking half a cig every 45 minutes, which seems to work better.

I don't want to be nagging or controlling whenever he says he's gonna go smoke, especially considering the stress/anxiety factor that seems to be affecting him the most, but I do want to help him quit. I just don't know how. Any advice?

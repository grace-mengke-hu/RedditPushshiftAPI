This is hard... first week seemed a bit easier...

I keep getting that feeling that "something is missing" and then think of cigarettes. How do you get that feeling to go away? Im very happy to be finished, but I can't help miss those times when i get the "relief" of smoking (even though it's total bullshit, like wearing shoes 2 sizes too small all day just to feel the relief of taking them off) 

Also I was in the middle of a craving, and searching for a business card in a drawer and I found a cigarette, just sitting right there under some paper. I took it and immediately dropped it in my half empty coffee mug from this morning. Pretty proud of myself!

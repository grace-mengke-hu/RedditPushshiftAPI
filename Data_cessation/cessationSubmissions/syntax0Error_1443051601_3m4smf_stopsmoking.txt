Tips on Feeling awkward around people that you used to smoke with?

I just feel awkward being around them when they are smoking, I have a hard time saying I quit, and it's not that I am not proud of it, I love telling non smokers I quit, just don't want to sound like a douche,  like oh I am better than you... I sometimes don't even have the balls to tell them I quit and make excuses and say I'll have one later... How do you guys deal with it?

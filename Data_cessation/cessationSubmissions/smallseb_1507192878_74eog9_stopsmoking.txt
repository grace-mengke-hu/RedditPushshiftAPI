Day 5 and some interrogations

It's been 5 days now since I've decided to stop for good. 
Even if this idea was flourishing in my head for serval month now, I had a big ass party the day before, and the next days were easier. Spend more time recovering from the party than feeling the lack of smoking... I didn't even know when my "last cigarette" was. 
Two weeks before that I did bought on the internet small magnet (ig zerosmoke) to paste on your ear few hours a day that "work like acupuncture"  they say(I did pay €3 not €35 like you might found). 
It might have not worked at all or made no difference, still I have used that thing for about two weeks and wanted to know if some of you did try theses things? 

Also, I had one rough night : yesterday I barely slept and sweat like I was sick to my bones.  I mean, my bed, sheets, pillows were soaked. Did anyone experienced something alike? 

Finally, what is your most powerful trick to get your mind off smoking when you have the urge ? 

I'm most definitely happy to get it off me after 20yrs of bad habit. I can't even realise how long it was and how great I think about this decision... 

Thanks for the support anyways

Been struggling for the past week....

I thought I was over the hump in regards to extreme urges but I guess I am wrong. They get so strong that I snap and just cry uncontrollably again. Last night I kicked some furniture. My husband must think I am a nut job but he is also very supportive. He suggested I read Allen Carr again. 

I had been smoking for over 35 years. I donâ€™t want to give nicotine control over my life again. Not one more puff no matter what. Even if it means that I have to replace some furnishings.

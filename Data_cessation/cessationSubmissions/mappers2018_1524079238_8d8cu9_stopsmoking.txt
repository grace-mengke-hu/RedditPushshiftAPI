On day 3 with patch and I am so miserable. I have been smoking for 25 freaking years, which just makes me sick to think about. I'm feeling like I need to invest in a punching bag or something similar. Any one have a good way of coping with the strong cravings?

I did quit for 6 months or so twice before using the patch.  Back on it now but damn if this is still super difficult.  My brain tells me to just smoke a cigarette but I know that I don't need it and really don't want it.  On the one hand, I love smoking - the hand to mouth habit, the feeling of exhaling the smoke, the taste of it with coffee and alcohol.  But I also hate it, the money spent, the potential health issues, etc.  Really just venting here but my brain won't let go of the idea of "just one".  I know it will never be just one but I am struggling with the cravings regardless.  Frustrating as all get out.

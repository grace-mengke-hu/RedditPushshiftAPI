Saturday was the last day...

I only had three cigarettes left in my pack on Saturday morning...then I went to Rainbow Blossom (a health food store) with a friend of mine and picked up 400 Teaberry flavored chew-sticks (which are basically really fancy toothpicks that taste like menthol and tea).  If you mix anything with them (including the taste of cigarettes) for about twenty minutes after chewing them they make your mouth taste like hobo-butthole.  So...yeah...

I've quit for a few weeks here and there, but I'm leaving for a trip Wednesday and travelling with non-smokers, so I figure it'll be as good a time as any to quit for good.

Yes, I did finish my pack Saturday though, but I've been smoke free since Sunday.

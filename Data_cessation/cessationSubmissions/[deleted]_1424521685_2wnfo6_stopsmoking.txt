Quit smoking Feel awesome !

I quit smoking on 5th January.I was not a chain smoker but I used to have a minimum of 1-2 cigarettes per day.I smoked Marlboro lights only but any cigarette of any brand is harmful.I decided to run a half marathon this February.I started training from the 1st of January and soon found out that I have absolutely no stamina whatsoever. I am quite overweight and in addition to that I was a smoker. I couldn't run more than 1 km. Ever since I quit smoking, I feel incredible. Seriously, I jog every morning and sometimes work out at the gym in the evenings now. It feels so good to have quit smoking. I can breathe better now, I have more stamina and the biggest positive is that I'm saving a lot of money !:) The best part about this is that I even convinced two of my best friends to quit smoking.Also, I have lost about 5 kgs in almost 2 months. And another positive is that I don't need to spray deodorant all over me before going home so that my parents don't find out.;) Seriously, quitting smoking is one of the best decisions I have ever made in my life.

3 days zero cigarettes! I am getting nicotine through a vape,need your thoughts.

30 year smoker, down from about a pack and a half a day to less than 10 per day. Stop buying them and stopped carrying them in my pocket. Hand rolled a few, swipe them from my wife and Friends. I would have a couple in the morning and then none all day but couldn't wait for my wife to get home from work so I can attack her and get one. The last two evenings I've had no urge to even approach her and have one. I've been vaping a lot, well it seems like a lot I guess. Who has turned from cigarettes to vape and then eventually was able to quit vaping as well? I would like to stop The Vaping some day as well. I imagine I'll cut down the nicotine until it's 0 for a while. Is this dangerous thinking? It seems like even posting it here  will help with accountability from others who care. 

Thanks in advance for any encouragement and advice. I want to be an ex-smoker or do I call myself a non-smoker?

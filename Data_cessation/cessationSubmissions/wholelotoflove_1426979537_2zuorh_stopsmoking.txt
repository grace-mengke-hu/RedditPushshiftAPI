Four days and counting

Hi guys. Its been 4 days now since I quit smoking. Its actually going well, and haven't had much cravings, after the first day. And still, I am afraid. I have tried so many times. Used many technics. And failed myself and my loved ones time and again. There were always excuses: stress, sleep deprivation, hunger, depression ...
All the above have been triggers, and alcohol of course.
I lost faith in my self and my ability to quit.
I have been battling this for almost 20 years.
After each attempt I would quickly return to a pack a day. 
I am a total nicotine junky. One cigarette is all it takes to get me smoking again...
I am determined this time . I've caused enough damage to myself. I need to prove it to my self and my teen age kids. It's good to read your posts and know I am not alone. Any words of support or advice are greatly appreciated. Thank you all.

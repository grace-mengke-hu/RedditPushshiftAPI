Day 5

I was addicted to e-cig, I used to smoke very strong liquids (18/24 mg/ml) for more than 4 years. I decided to quit it immediately. I'm feeling pretty good, sometimes I'm having emotional rollercoaster but it's normal, isn't it? 2nd and 3rd day were the worst for me, because I was close to giving up, but after I survived them without smoking everything is okay so far. The worst thing is that sometimes my mind (not me) wants to go back to smoking, and this makes me kinda ,,regret" this decision for a while. How much time do I need to get rid of these stupid thoughts?

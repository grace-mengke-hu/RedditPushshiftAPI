Yesterday was the toughest day for me but i did not smoked, feeling proud.

So i dropped the L yesterday and i can say for sure i have never wanted to smoke a cigg so hard in last 21 days but somehow i managed not to smoke, and right now i feel so good about it. Just wanted to share my experience with everyone-  "Its all in your mind"

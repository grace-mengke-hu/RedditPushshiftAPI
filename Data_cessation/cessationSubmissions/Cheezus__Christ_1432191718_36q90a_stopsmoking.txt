Alternative to dipping and smoking, Grinds.

I havent seen these posted on here but i suppose this is quit smoking not dipping... I dipped since I was 15 and I am 23 now. I picked up smoking ironically as a way to ween myself off dip and that turned into an addiction all in its own. I ordered a sampler pack of Grinds and they really helped me get past the first couple of days which are always the hardest for me.
They are coffee grounds in pouches and have a little spurt of caffeine in em. May not work for everyone, but my biggest problem was how bad I chewed the inside of my mouth subconsciously. Best of luck to all of ya! I've almost hit a week and looking to keep it going!

If you are looking to try em, just google grinds.

Day 1 for the last time.

I've quit smoking cigs every day for the last 2 weeks and just cave around lunch time. I give in, and the first half of a cig is regret and I half enjoy it then the rest of the day is "ah well damage is done today".  Today is different I got this, good luck to all you trying as well. I quit for 4 years before so I know its do-able.  I read the Easy Way by alan carr multiple times and it makes a lot of sense when I read it but to put the attitude into practice is difficult. Have good one y'all.

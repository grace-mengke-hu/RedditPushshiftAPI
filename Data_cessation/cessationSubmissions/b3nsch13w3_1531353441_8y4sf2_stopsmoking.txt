Extreme mood swings/depression with withdrawals?

I'm trying to quit vaping (20-25 puffs a day for the past few weeks). Is it considered normal to have bipolar-like symptoms (extreme anger outbursts, daily suicidal thoughts/actions, etc) when quitting? I don't wanna talk to my parents or a doctor if this is expected, but I'm worried it might be something more. Thanks for any help

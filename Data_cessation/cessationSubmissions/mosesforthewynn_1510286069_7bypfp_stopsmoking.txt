4 Days In And I Feel Psychotic

I haven't slept well the past few nights. I haven't felt normal since the second day.  I've been getting waves of anxiety that precede intense cravings. I'm exhausted and I can't focus on anything, and I've barely been able to eat. Has anyone else experienced this? If so, how long did it last and how did you keep yourself motivated? I don't have any desire to smoke so I know I'm not going to, just the cravings. I never realized before that the cravings were such a broken distorted mimic of desire. Now that I realize that I feel like it makes it easier to let them pass, but it is still so exhausting.

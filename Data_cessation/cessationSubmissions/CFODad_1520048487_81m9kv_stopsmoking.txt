Down To 6-7 Per Day

I went from 30 per day to 6-7 per day in two weeks. That was difficult.

The next step seems insurmountable. I canâ€™t make headway. I feel a lot better and like I can do it but it honestly makes me somewhat depressed when I think about going lower.

This is after 35 years of smoking. Just looking for encouragement.

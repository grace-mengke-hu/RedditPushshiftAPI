Help me not starting?

Hi guys.

I am making an exchange program in Munich, Germany. I am 21 yo, brazilian, and the cultural differences really hit me hard, so that for the first time in my whole life, I smoked three days in a row two cigarrets. I really don't want to do it, but the context I am living in makes hard no to try any kind of new enjoyable act.

I know this is bad for me, you all know it is, but still I gave it a chance, a chance that I don't want to give anymore before it's too late. Like, this is the best time to stop: when you haven't even started.

Any word I would appreciate.

Thx and good luck in your fighting stopping smoke.

7 weeks without tobacco.

I actually quit just before last Christmas and kept it going for a few months, but then one night I got drunk and ended up having a few cigars. That led on to me having a few the next week, and the next week, and so on, until the point where I was actually smoking them daily. And by that point I was actually spending more money, and absorbing more nicotine as I was actually inhaling them. 

Then one morning I woke up without any and the withdrawals were the worst I've experienced, and knew there was something wrong. So then I googled nicotine levels in cigars, and was horrified to realise that I was actually absorbing a ridiculous amount of nicotine. So I knew I had to stop, and I did.

The cravings were just overwhelming at times, but I rode it out, and have not had any tobacco of any kind for 7 weeks today, and I'm more determined than ever not to touch another one. Its also good that I've got no desire to drink or smoke weed anymore, as they were obvious triggers for wanting another one.

And I do of course feel so much better physically, but you simply cannot buy that mental freedom of not constanly wondering about your next cigarette/cigar/roll-up, or always planning ahead to make sure you've got enough to last.

Thanks for listening, and good riddance to a bad habit.

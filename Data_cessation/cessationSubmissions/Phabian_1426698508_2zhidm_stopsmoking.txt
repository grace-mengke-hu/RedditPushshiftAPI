What to do?

Boyfriend and I quit on 5th of August 2014. Boyfriend played the dangerous game of "I can smoke when I drink" but as of last week he started doing it almost every day.  He says he's just so stressed so he can keep it,  which tells me that he never really was in it for the long run..  Although he was the one who started this..  So I told him today to just fucking start smoking and be done with the lies and guilt,  because  I am sick of him constantly being on edge..  I know I should have said something else,  be more understanding and all that,  but I am just disappointed and sad that I was right when I saw him light up the first cigarette that he wouldn't last..  I need advice.  He says tomorrow he'll give et one last try to stay smoke free..  But he sounds like he has already given up..

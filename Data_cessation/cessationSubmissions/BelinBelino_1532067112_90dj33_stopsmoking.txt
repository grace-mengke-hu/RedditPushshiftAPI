Three years

It's been three years since I smoked my last cigarette.

I had been considering quitting for some because I had given a healthy turn to my life and smoking was objectively dumb.
But everybody around me kept on telling me how hard it would be or recounting their relapses.

Then my parents kicked me out: I was unemployed and I only had 1000 Euros on my bank account.

Struggling with withdrawal basically became a distraction from the shitshow my life had become.
I learned a lot on these subreddit and you gave strength when I thought I was about to give up.

Thank you all.

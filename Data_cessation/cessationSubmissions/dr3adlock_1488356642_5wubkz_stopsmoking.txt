Seriously, thanks to everyone.

I posted on Monday that I was quiting and the support was amazing! After I got back from work last night I was gagging and I just sat back and read all 30 comments and it helped so much! Each and every one of you said something different but relatable and even some stuff that hit me straight to the bone! I'm now 3 days without smoking and not surprisingly 3 days sober since alcohol is my trigger!

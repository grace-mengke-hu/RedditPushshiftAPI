I quit, and now my brain is fucking with me

I quit smoking 12 days ago after 10 years of 2 packs a day. And I was ok for the first 10 days, but for the last 2 days it's like I am getting nostalgic or something, I am constantly thinking about them, like - "they are a part of your personality, go back to them, you can even roll tobacco, it wont hurt as much as reds, ect.". 

So, any advice on how to fight this, beacause it's not stress that is forcing me to smoke, or nicotine need, its my brain not coping with the fact that I quit, like I lost a limb or something.

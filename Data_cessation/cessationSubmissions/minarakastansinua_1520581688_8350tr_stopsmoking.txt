I'm not addicted to anything but...

I just have to smoke something. Can someone please explain what is my problem? So if I have weed I don't think about cigarettes. When I don't have weed I buy a pack of cigarettes and don't think about weed at all. Recently I have some difficulties to breath, like not enough o2. I also have too much stress in my life and I've been depressed for two years so it make things harder for me. Should I switch to electronic?

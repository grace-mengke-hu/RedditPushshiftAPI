What the hell? I'm shoved and thrust against the wall.

I was a non smoker for almost two years. I would run 50k a week and read volumes of books like it's nobody's business. I was a vigorous machine. Until the unfortunate but necessary decision to take a prescribed SNRI to treat my crippling social anxiety. That's when it happened. 

I had an acute depression as a reaction and told my GP about it. He says it takes time to adjust to the drug. I was determined to get treatment. I thought I have to power through it but one night was the worst. So I wanted an urgent escape and I smoked hookah. The depression went away as expected and I gradually stopped smoking.

One day I missed the dosage and opted to double the dosage to compensate and I was hit again with depression. Hard. Now I'm back on hookah...daily. 

I wish I never knew the euphoric recall. I wish I have never messed the balance of my neurotransmitters. Fuck this vicious cycle. /rant

allen carr's easyway to stop smoking

has anyone else read this book? i used it a few years ago and found it tremendously helpful in getting a solid, non-smoking mindset going. you're supposed to continue smoking while you read the book, and honestly by the end of it you're so fed up with smoking that it's easy to stop after the last one. i got back into smoking (my husband smokes) and about a year later am ready to quit again, and used the book as a bit of a cheerleader. maybe it can help someone else struggling. it really reinforces the idea that cigarettes do nothing for you but shorten life and lessen quality of life, etc. check it out. hopefully this thread isn't against the rules in some way, i just hope it helps someone who needs to either take the leap of faith or is struggling with staying motivated/lacking willpower.

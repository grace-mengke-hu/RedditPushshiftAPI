In 2012, I said no more smoking, and I meant it!

Its my first time posting here in years because I don't feel like I even quit. I smoked from ages 13 to 22 (9 years) and I never thought I would quit. As of today, I forget that I quit, because its been so long sincce I smoke, and I never get cravings. One day I hope that will be any of you!

I used to crave cigarettes so bad, I would go to my local grocery store and gather cigarette butts in the ashtray and either smoke them or roll them into a joint and smoke them if I didn't have money for smokes. I wouldn't be able to got to sleep at night unless I had enough cigarettes to smoke at night.

Nowadays I forget that I even was a nicotine addict, because it doesn't bother me, and one day you will be too. I never thought  that I would ever quit cigarettes, they were such a part of my life. I tried quitting a few times and just accepted my life as an addict. Believe me you can do it, just look at my streak!

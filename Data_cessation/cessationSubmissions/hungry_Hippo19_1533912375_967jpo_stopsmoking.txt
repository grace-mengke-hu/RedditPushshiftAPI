After nearly 10 years and too many attempts to quit, today is the day.

Last night  I smoked my last cigarette after a pack a day for close to 10 years. Over the past week I have cut down to one or two a day and last night was the last one. Thank you to you all for showing me that it can be done and I no longer have to be a slave to this disgusting habbit. Heres to turning the page and starting a new smoke free chapter.

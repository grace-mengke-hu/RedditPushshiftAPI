I'm not sure what to do. (Chewing tobacco)

There isn't really an active quit dip sub and I don't have anyone else to talk to so I want to ask advice on here. I started out dipping once in awhile when hiking or working out and it was great. That lasted for quite awhile but then for the last 2 years I have become very addicted. I was chewing almost two can/day. That is almost 8 bucks  everyday. I did some traveling for most of march and I was never able to get dip. While I was traveling I smoked a little bit but I never liked smoking so when I got back on march 20th I had no problem not smoking. I still have not had any dip since late April and no tobacco at all since march 20th. I have recently had some cravings. I always liked dip and the only problem I had after being addicted was the cost. I didn't plan on quitting after I got back but so far that is what happened. Is it possible I can go back to just one dip/day like it used to be or will that inevitably bring me back to 2 cans/day? Also how long was it before you could go a whole week without thinking of tobacco? Lastly once I have been addicted is it ever possible to go back to infrequently use without bringing back cravings?

Edit: I have not had chewing tobacco since late February**

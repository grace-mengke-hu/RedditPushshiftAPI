Help me quit smoking ASAP

So I need to quit ASAP. My boyfriend and I are looking for a new place and all the nice houses and duplex’s are non smoking properties. We don’t even smoke in the house anyway because of our son and the cats so you know the first few we looked at we explained we are outside smokers only and courteous to anyone around us (neighbors) and do not leave of cigarette butts lying around that we’re trying to quit (which I guess is somewhat true but I can’t say I’ve made a SERIOUS effort yet the past few months I’ve quit ten times lasting anywhere from six hours to two days yeah I know pathetic) so now we’re at the point where we are acting like non smokers completely via response to Craigslist ads for houses. We’re seeing a place Monday and I have two packs left and want to just be done, those two packs will last me till Friday. If I can’t then the plan is to have my last cig before a shower and make sure my clothes and coat are all freshly washed and to clean my car of lingering smoke as well. Don’t know if it will be close to being good enough because non smokers for some reason can smell it a mile away on a smoker. My boyfriend plans to do the same Monday and I don’t think he wants to really quit for good. This is our top choice and if we get it we will have to leave the property completely for a cig which would be hard being 1.5 pack a day smokers and having my toddler. I’m home alone all day with him I can’t just leave him in the house and go walk down the street to have a cigarette I NEED to quit. I don’t know how I’m going to do this HELP

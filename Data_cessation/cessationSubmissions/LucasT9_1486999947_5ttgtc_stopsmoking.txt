I can't even try to to quit!

So as I said, I can't even try to quit. I don't understand what's happening to me. Yesterday I've decided that tomorrow (today) I'm going to quit smoking, I really thought that's it, I threw away all cigarettes, lighters etc. And what do you think has happened, this morning I just went to the shop, and bought a pack of cigarettes without any regrets. It's really hard to explain, but I've lost control over myself.
Years ago It wasn't that hard to try at least. I was able to hold on for a few days or weeks, and like 4 years ago for 8 months. After those 8 months I've never tried to quit, until 2 week ago, I thought I will try, but I couldn't. And It keeps happening, so I don't get it why, does cigarettes ruined me? 
Any encouraging words? Tips? Because I really want to quit, or to try at least.


By the way, I started to exercise, eat healthy, so I have some will power, also I'm not insane. 

Sorry for my English.

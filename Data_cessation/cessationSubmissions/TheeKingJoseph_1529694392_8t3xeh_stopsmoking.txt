By the time i hit post, I will have begun my quitting of nicotine.

I posted earlier this morning about quitting nicotine. I transitioned from tobacco to vapes about 5 years ago so i never faced a serious withdraw before. I was on a 50mg vape and have weened down over the last 2-3 weeks. when i hit post on this post, my journey begins. Im almost shaking in fear and excitement. my anxiety is really high but so are my hopes. wish me luck guys, ill be around this subreddit. Much love and thanks for the support thus far.

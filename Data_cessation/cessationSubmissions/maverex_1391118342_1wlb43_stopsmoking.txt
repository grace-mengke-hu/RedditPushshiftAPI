MavereX's guide to EASILY stop smoking.

I have not smoked in over a year and know I will NEVER smoke again! It doesn't even take much will power!

Step 1. 

Buy a quality ecigarette.
(not all ecigarettes are even close to the same)



For simplicity's sake I'll say theres two main parts to an ecigarette, the battery and the tank. 


- make sure you get a starter kit with two or more batteries so you dont run out of battery no matter how long your day. (A 900mah battery lasted me an 18 hour shift, 1.5 pack a day ex smoker)

Beginner Recommendations: Ego-T Starter Kit with the longer 900mah batteries.

- Get a large capacity 3ml+, low resistance tank (low resistance = more smoke with a non voltage-changing battery)

-------------------------------------

Step 2.


Buy "ejuice" or "eliquid"

Start with HIGH nicotine 18-26(pack a day smoker)

Or Extra-High 28-36mg/ml  (two pack a day smoker)

Buy a sample pack of misc. Flavors or buy a bunch of 10ml bottles. 

So you can try out a few flavors and see what you like and can smoke all day and love it (we vapers call it ADV or All Day Vape)

Once you know what you really want buy 30ml bottles. 




If you're in Canada this can be harder to find. In America its really easy.

Here's some help for my Canadian friends:

www.canadavapes.com 
(lots of kits and equipment, acceptable selection of eliquid, slightly expensive but still cheaper than cigarettes, fast shipping and processing)

www.mapleleafvapes.com 
(by far the best selection of eliquids, super long shipping/processing times, I recommend double flavor shots (intense flavor!) but dont do triple thats for advanced users diluting and stuff)

------------------------------------

Step 3


Vape! Enjoy and im positive you'll never want to smoke again because this tastes so much better!!!

-------------------------------------

Vapers wishing to advance to the next level:

Buy a variable voltage battery for intense flavor and smoke. 

My favorite Battery:

iTaste VIP 2.0. 

It has a 2600mah battery that lasts DAYS and can even charge your phone via USB. 3.3v - 5.0v 

My favorite tank:

Davide Glass Clearomizer

Hard to fill, (need a needle tip)
Amazing smoke when I want to make clouds and make smokers envious but still last forever I use this tank. Good flavor.


Do some research and enjoy! :)

EDIT: When you buy your next round of 30ml bottles drop the nicotine dosage slowly, or fast. However you want to play it out :) but expect to vape more at first.

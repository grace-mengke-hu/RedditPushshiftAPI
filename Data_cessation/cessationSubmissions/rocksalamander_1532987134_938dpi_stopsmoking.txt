So, as I said in another thread, I was about 6 hrs in, on Sat. (1 pack a day habit 16 yrs). I dug the unopened pack out of the trash, and smoked it for half of Sat and until they ran out at 10 last night. 

I didn't go out for my before-bed cig, slapped on a patch I had bought for a recent long plane ride, and went to sleep. 

This morning- skipped the coffee, had tea instead, which I hate mixing with cigs, so that worked. Haven't smoked yet today.  

I know most of you are celebrating the weeks, months, and years milestones, but I'm fighting for the first 24 right now. 

Having people in the house who would rather I failed is not helping.

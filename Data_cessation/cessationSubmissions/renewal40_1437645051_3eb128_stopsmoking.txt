Trying again, looking for the right coping mechanism

I posted here before. I rarely smoke real cigs but have been actually extremely addicted to various non-cigarette form of tobacco (esp e-cigs recently). Sure the harms are less (probably), but I work in an environment when it's not acceptable and I really hate all of my daily activities being dependent on my ability to destress with a couple puffs of that cig. I have been overly dependent on nicotine for some time such that I hate doing things out of my comfort zone or tackling those tasks I need to get done without my ecig. I need to find new habits.

Common question for those who feel like commenting: Any good tricks you've used for replacement? Gum is okay, water is fine but in the short term I feel like I need something that actually gives myself the dopamine surge but without a bad habit.

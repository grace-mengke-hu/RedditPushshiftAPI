Relapsed 19 days in, but not going to give up

I feel pretty bad, but I'm still firm in my goal of quitting. Not going to reset my quit clock or anything, I think that will discourage me quite a bit to be honest.


Something that I noted when I smoked the cigarette was how horrible it tasted. It was my preferred brand before I quit, too. But it just tasted like chemicals. I can definitely see how my body has changed since I quit.


All the best.

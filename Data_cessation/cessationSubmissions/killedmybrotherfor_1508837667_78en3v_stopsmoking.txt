1 year and 364 days

I'm not sure what I'm going to do on Wednesday to celebrate, but I have decided to use today to reflect. 

I carried around this piece of paper with my reasons for quitting for the last two years. I want to share these reasons with you because maybe they will help you as much as they helped me. 

Every time I was upset, stressed, sad, or fiending for a cigarette, I took these reasons out of my wallet and read the list out loud to myself.  

I'm not saying this list changed everything. But it set me on a path that gave me the strength to change small things. I found that once I changed enough small things, the big things took care of themselves. 

REASONS TO QUIT SMOKING:

I want to smell good again

I want to be healthier for those who love me and for myself

I don't want premature wrinkles, yellow teeth or bad breath: FUCK CANCER

I don't want to offend those near me with pungent odors

I don't want to sweat nicotine anymore

I need healthier coping habits

I want to stop spending $150/m to kill myself 

I'll like myself better

I want to sing again

I want to be able to hold a conversation or make love to my boyfriend without coughing to clear my throat or breathe

For my mom. My sisters. My brothers.

For me. Because I deserve it.

Nicotine Salts helped me with my nicotine addiction

I started smoking when I was a teenager. I never liked it but did it to fit in, then I got addicted to the nicotine. For 20 years I've been smoking up to 3 packs a day! I tried everything in my effort to quit - the patch, therapy, hypnosis. I even tried smoking e-cigarettes a few years ago, but nothing worked. I recently went to a vape show in Birmingham, UK with a buddy who smokes as well. This company had something called nicotine salts. I've never heard of it but many people swore by it that it helped them control their addiction. I am in the process of vaping it to see if it works. So far, it is not bad. I do not smoke cigarettes as much, and it has only been a few weeks I've been using the nic-salts. Has anyone else heard of nicotine salts or have experience with it? I want to know what you think of it.

3 weeks!!!

After only a few tough days of unrelenting cravings, it's been nothing but smooth sailing the last couple weeks. A major milestone for me was turning down smokes that people offered out of the blue, and I was even able to do it with a smile on my face. I couldn't be happier or more proud of myself. I wanted to take the time to share my little victory, and say thank you to all the other people on this subreddit who have unknowingly motivated me to kick this awful habit and get healthy. If any new or potential quitters ever want any advice, I'd love to share tips that have helped me in the short time I've got under my belt. Good luck to everyone, and stay positive. :)

How are you guys doing today ? Some tips to help you out.

Quit smoking few days back. Just checking in with you peeps and sharing some tips which personally helped me to stay clear of smokes.

I eat mints to mimic the hand to mouth motion that we smokers get acquainted too. Get sugar free mints if you want.

Get a cup of green tea . I think most of you may be office goers and want to have a smoke after siting say 30 minutes in front of a computer. Go out and have a green tea. Else black coffee (whatever is free in your breakroom), but no ciggies.

I have an iOS app that keeps track of my health progress since quitting smoke. Get one such app. It gives you push notifications every now and then ..like "10 cigarettes non-smoked" or like "Sudden Death Risk lowered"...etc. Also indicates the money you have saved since quitting. This is by far the greatest motivator for me as everyday i keep trying to see..can i go like a month without smoking...etc.. Its all in your head.!

Finally try to stay clear of fucking vapes. Same shit different package. I read a harvard article here on reddit today that linked some flavors of vapes to lung disease. SO stay clear. In my case I dont have the fucking money to buy a vape , so I do not use them.

Lastly, share your stories, motivations here so as to encourage others . This is the only subreddit that is constantly open in my browser tab and i read it religiously.

Stay safe. Wishing you all a merry Xmas.!

Time for a Reset :(

I actually can't believe this happened. I went out on Saturday night, got quite drunk and smoked. Wasn't really anything more complex than that. I had one cigarette left in the pack that I smoked Sunday morning and haven't had one since.

My real concern is having to tell people that I relapsed. Particularly my mom. She was so impressed by the fact that I quit smoking that she's decided to do it too. 

Do you think that by telling her, I'll make her less likely to succeed? Or am I just feeling guilty?

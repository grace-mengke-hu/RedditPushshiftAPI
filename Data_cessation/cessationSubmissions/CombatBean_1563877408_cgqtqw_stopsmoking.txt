Today.. end. Next try

Hey guys.

I was a half year off that sh*t. When something when drastically wrong last year, I started to smoke again.

Right now i‘m super annoyed of breathing troubles.. slime.. and problems with endurance while running (lung starts burning and running out of breath).

Next to that it costs a lot of money. Since I plan to join the armed forces and want to quit it, before I might start.

I will end this pack 4 cigarettes and put it down. Hopefully forever this time!

Btw: that Pokémon dude.. you really improves your painting skills :)! Like to see them every day :)!

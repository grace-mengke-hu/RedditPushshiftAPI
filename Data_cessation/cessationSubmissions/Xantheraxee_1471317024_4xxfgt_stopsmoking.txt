4th day without Cigarettes

I smoked for 10 years of my  life and recently switched over to vaping after watching  some tests on youtube (vaping vs smoking, there was water tests, filter tests and a mouse test, water was clean, filter was clean and the mouse survived the vape. The mouse that got the cigarette smoke died within a few minutes). I've made this decision and got myself a vape and liquid  with 6mg of nicotine in it. My plan is to slowly get off nicotine too.  I  haven't even had a craving since starting to vape. This vape is going to  save my life lol.

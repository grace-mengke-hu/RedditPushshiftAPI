Ready to start quitting again...

I started smoking about 14 years ago off and on, mostly on. Gonna give it my best shot. This is just a little reminder to myself that you always wish you didn't start smoking. Even if you know you have the money to buy this shit you don't have to go to the store and get a pack. The BJ embargo has gone too far you must get some of that sweet sweet awesome. I mean seriously what the hell are you thinking? Cigs aren't worth the money/time/health. Seriously BJ's! wth hell man.

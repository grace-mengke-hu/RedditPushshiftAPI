Without any vitriol, can we discuss "relapses"?

So, I'm approaching my birthday. This is my second birthday since I've officially quit, according to Smoke Free, 1 year, 4 months, 8 days ago. That being said, I have smoked twice in that period: 3 cigarettes while drinking on my birthday, and 5 cigarettes on a random weekend trip while out at a bar. I personally don't see it as "falling off the wagon" and having to start all over, because they were two isolated incidents. I didn't pick up a couple packs and smoke for days or weeks or months after. It was, in both scenarios, a casual social bar setting with lots of beer involved. I feel like I'm still fully committed to being quit, but that I'm allowed some leniency and self-forgiveness, and realistically I think it's very likely I smoke again on my birthday. What do you think? Have you had similar experiences?

Best 50 days in my life since 10 years

I have quit smoking and it has been 50 days since I smoked my last cigarette. I was smoking for 10 years ,I was heavy smoker (about 60 cig /day) yes 3+ packs /day, I deliberately remember saying this is my last cigarette and no more single puff ,Ihave been able to stay strong on my word since then. The first 2 weeks were a bit hard but after that it was easy and I realized how I made such a good decision. I am about to be 35 and I am very thankful to all of the people here who have helped me quit especially my wife ,this was one of my goals and I am very happy to have achieved it.

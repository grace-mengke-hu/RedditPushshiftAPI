I want to quit smoking, but something's holding me back

So I've been trying to quit smoking off and on for about 4 years and have never made it past 3 days.  I feel like when I quit smoking I don't want to tell anyone because I've tried this so many times and told people in my social circle and family that I was quitting, only for them to see me a day later or later in the day lighting up.  I feel like saying the words is meaningless, and even thinking about it fills me with evil doubt.  

I just wonder if anyone has any constructive feedback about the mental aspect.  I feel like stopping smoking would be wonderful for me and would improve just about every aspect of my life but it seems like every time I try I talk myself back into it.

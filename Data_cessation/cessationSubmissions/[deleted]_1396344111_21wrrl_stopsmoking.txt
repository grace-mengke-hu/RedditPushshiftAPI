It's been one week, thanks to this sub.

It may not seem long but to me it's brilliant. I'm no longer feeling disgusting, wasting money or feeling like I have an anchor attached to me. I've saved around Â£37 already! (according to my iPhone app) and I've put that in my savings account. 

Just reading this sub and using it as a support has stopped me from lighting up numerous times so really thanks :)

5(+) years! Wow, totally missed it.

So yeah, been nicotine free for 5 years now. My partner had to remind me of it the other day, and I said, "oh shit, I need to go on r/stopsmoking and make a post!" and then forgot.

Point is, now, I don't even think about smoking, ever. I missed the anniversary of the greatest thing I've ever done because it's such a non issue now.

Next point is - YOU CAN DO IT TOO! Stick with it and you'll be where I'm at before you know it!

Edit - Thanks everyone! This subreddit did so much for me early on while quitting, it was always great to come here and see all the other people going through the same thing I was.

PTSD and Quitting Smoking?

So this is the first time I've submitted a post to any website ever, which I hope speaks to how much I want to know how/if others have dealt with this issue.

So I have PTSD (everyone's favorite topic, I know), which I've dealt with for the past 25+ years mostly without medication, mostly by myself, and also, sadly, mostly while smoking.

I've come to the point where I'm very stable (and successful) and I can "quit" cigarettes for 2 weeks to 3 months, but then a "trigger" comes and I make a quick beeline to the nearest gas station for a pack. I smoke about four and then throw the rest away. I don't abuse alcohol or any other substances, exercise regularly (almost every day). I really don't want to have to go back on medication (mostly because of the terrible side effects, not pride) and I already bike, do yoga, blah blah regularly, but I also don't want to have to start and stop smoking again every time my PTSD triggers. I know the psychological aspects of nicotine addiction are hardest for me (obviously), I just don't know how to get over or around it other than drinking water, exercising, etc., the tips that are posted all over the www. I'd really love to hear how others with PTSD or other mood/mental disorders have negotiated smoking cessation. 

Does anyone else have experience with this? At this point, it would be helpful even to know if anyone else has been able to conquer this addiction with PTSD; right now it feels insurmountable and all PTSD materials and groups seem to be populated by chain smokers.

Thanks!

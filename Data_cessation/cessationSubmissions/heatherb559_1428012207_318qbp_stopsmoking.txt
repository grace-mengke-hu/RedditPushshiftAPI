Spring time!

I have been so wrapped up in my quit that I've forgotten that its spring! In just a couple weeks it will be time to get the summer garden in. I'm so excited! I just love a tomato sandwich. And this year it is going to taste better than ever! The flowers are going to smell better. I'm not going to get all out of breath when I work in the garden, or paddle my kayak, or walk my dog. I feel a sudden lightness... Is this it? Is this what freedom feels like. I am so happy I laid those bastards down. Never again! Not One More Puff! Happy Spring All! Thanks for not smoking with me today!

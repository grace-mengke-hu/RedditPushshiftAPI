Rookie redditor, veteran smoker

Hey guys. Been browsing through all of the different threads in this community and figured this is as good a time as any to give quitting a shot. Again. I've tried to quit so many times that I'm embarrassed to even say the words "I'm quitting" as it just makes me feel like a liar and that I'm making a promise that I know I can never keep. The excited responses I would have gotten the first couple of times I said it have turned into skeptical congratulations. However I don't want to sound like a defeatist. I know quitting is possible as heavier smokers than I have succeeded permanently. And giving up quitting just because the previous times have failed would be like never dating again because all previous relationships ultimately ended. Ok rant over. I'll just see how it goes and learn all I can in the process to hopefully ensure success. Any advice or support is appreciated.

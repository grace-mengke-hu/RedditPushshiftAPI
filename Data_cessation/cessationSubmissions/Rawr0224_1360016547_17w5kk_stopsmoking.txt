It's been a rough week. 

I quit smoking on January 31st  - Downloaded the Cessation Nation App - Blew through several alternatives to smoking when I get cravings - but it is still SO HARD. I am on 4 days smoke free now, I used to smoke 9 - 10 a day, and I have been smoking for the past 7 years. I have made attempts in the past, but I am 100% serious this time for various medical reasons. I quit after a very unpleasant doctors visit, threw away all of my bic's and empty packs laying around the house, washed all of my clothes, and lessened my time with my friends that smoke. All that remains of my smoking habit/addiction is my faithful Zippo. But even though I eliminated everything that would trigger any sort of craving, I still get them, and they aren't easy to deal with. I understand I really shouldn't smoke for my health, I think about how great it would be to smell nice, not need to rely on smoking as a crutch for all of my emotions, and to be able to breathe when I go jogging. But sometimes that isn't even enough, and I don't know why. My only support in this is my boyfriend who has never in his life smoked, so as hard as he tries to support me he really doesn't understand what I am going through... Any advice on how to stay strong?  I know I can be smoke free, but Iâ€™d like to not go crazy while I am getting there.

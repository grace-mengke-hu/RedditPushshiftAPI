Coughing up dark brown phlegm after quitting

Did anyone else go through this? Today is my twelfth day since my last cigarette (after smoking half a pack everyday for the last seven years) and I'm coughing up a lot of thick, dark brown phlegm, especially as soon as I wake up. And I can also feel a slight tightening in my chest, like something is stuck in my lungs and I'm not able to cough it up.
I could feel my breathing slowly improve since I quit, but it's been like this for the last 2-3 days. 
Any help is appreciated! Thanks.

Plan to quit everything

Now that i have quit smoking, I am planning to quit drinking coke and quit eating junk food as well. I am already saving $250 a month by not smoking. I figure I will save another $100-$200 by stop eating junk food. In six months time, I plan to be free of cigs, coke, and junk food.

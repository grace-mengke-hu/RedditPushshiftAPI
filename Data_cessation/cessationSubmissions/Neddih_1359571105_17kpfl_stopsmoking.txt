Will working with a smoker increase my chances at failure?

I am going on two weeks as of tomorrow and I feel great. I only have small cravings when I drink or out at social gatherings with alcohol, but I have stayed strong. As far as work life, it has been a piece of cake which is surprising considering I work in a stressful environment. I think part of what is has been is none of my coworkers smoke. (Medical field) So I don't usually have it around me too often here which is good considering I work 24-48 hour shifts.
I recently found out I will be working with someone who smokes quite often and I'll be around this person over 120 hours every couple of weeks. Basically, I'm scared that my motivation to stay healthy might dissipate being around someone who smokes.
How do you guys do it that are constantly around smokers? Any tips?

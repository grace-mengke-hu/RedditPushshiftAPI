I love coming home

I love it that my hall doesn't smell like stale cigarette smoke reeking from my coats anymore. I love that I don't have ashtrays on my balcony. I love that my home smells like the spicy food I've cooked or incense or my perfume or just me. I fucking love coming home now that I'm a non smoker.

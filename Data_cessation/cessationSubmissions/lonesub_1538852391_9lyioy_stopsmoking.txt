Why Stop Smoking and other things .

Im going to start from today wish me luck. Now lets talk about why you should quit smoking im sure everyone knows it already im just ranting .

The Biggest Problem with smoking is the brains reward system . But people don't understand how f\*\*king hard it is to fight the craving no its easy to fight a craving we can distract our-self but you know what i am talking about there are time when you do things unconsciously for example like if your in a party and your friends hands you a smoke you just go about it as normal and after the first puff you think back shit i just quit . Well this happens a lot .We need to be more aware our brain only cares about making us feel good but doesnt understand the consiquences of the problem .

We are in a way responsible for implementing the habit into our lifestyle . The more we repeat it the more it becomes rooted in the brain . Its no different from hunger pangs . smoking is just one type of addiction . Like we get hungry when we watch movies ( well those who have a habit of watching  and eating ) . Similarly we have smoking associated with alcohol and after meal , Stress relief .

So what i am talking about is we really need to take charge of our life we cant walk around like chicken without its head . The brain might be built to make us survive but its a like taking advice from a junkie . The brain only knows to persuade us with pleasure . our craving are like a junkie ( Brain ) trying to sell is drugs and we buying ( Giving in to the craving ) to get a little high .

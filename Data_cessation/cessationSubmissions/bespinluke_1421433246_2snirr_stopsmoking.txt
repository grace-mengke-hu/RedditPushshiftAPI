The last time I had one was on monday.

Okay, I started smoking when I was 18, and I quite when I was 22. It was almost 5 years straight, when I quite I was 1-2 packs a week. I originally quite when I meet my wife, she inspired me. She never told me to quite it was a decision I made. Bought the nicotine lozenges and had to take them for about a month until I thought I could do without. And went on for about 8 years with a total of approximately 10 cigs here or there until now. 

I remember that when I was having a cigarette in that 8 year period I would get nauseous, light headed and upset stomach. I thought it was my body telling me that it did not want to go through the lozenge fiasco again. So after I would smoke one it would deter me for a very long time. 

In October of 2014, I went through a flurry of traumatic family issues, cousin passed from lukemia, brother came out and said he’s positive for HIV, Father stated using meth again, parents kick out my brother (we think he is using drugs too) and on top of that work has been pretty stressful lately. So I started smoking again during breaks and lunches. I didn’t tell my wife that I started smoking again so I don’t smoke on weekends or after work. 

It’s time to stop again. I am confident that I don’t need the lozenges this time, it’s been 4 days and though the cravings are there. I’m doing a good job at fending them off with gum or coffee. It’s hard, cold turkey sucks, not wanting to tell my wife because of the disappointment sucks. What I think is weird is that my only support is probably going to be you guys and a couple of people I told in a  post a last week.

Just wanted to get this off my chest. The struggle is real.

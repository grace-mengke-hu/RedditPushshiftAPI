12 Days, first post here

I had been smoking for about 17 years now. I did quit once in that period for about 2 years - that was about 5 years ago. I get pretty darn sick about twice a year, and it always turns into a respiratory infection, flooring me for ~2 weeks. This last time happened right before a vacation, and I decided that was it. As soon as I left my house for the vacation I threw away my pack and bought some gum. I find it loads easier to quit when you break your routine, so the vacation was perfect timing.

I started chewing the gum at about 6-8 pieces a day to get over that first hump. Returned from vacation 8 days later. Now 12 days later I'm down to 2-3 pieces a day, and trying to cut that to 1-2 by next week. Haven't had a cigarette since. Being back at home is what I find the hardest. My dog too. He was used to my many breaks to go outside, and now not so much. My coworkers smoke as well, and being in the office is a little rough, but surprisingly not as bad as I thought. I do still go outside with them occasionally, but have not touched a cigarette. My lungs feel loads better already. 

I've also started drinking loads more water, and eating much healthier in an attempt to not gain weight while quitting.

Just wanted to share. That is all. Thanks for listening!

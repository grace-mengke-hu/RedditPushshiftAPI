Is it advisable to quit mid-exams?

Hey, I'm in the middle of exam week for my HSC trials (those of u who aren't Australian, this is how we get into university and it's VERY competitive). I really want to get good grades it is really important to me, and the plan was initially to quit in a week, but I'm fucking sick of the cigarettes. The only thing is, we can't take any sort of food or anything into the exam rooms with us so I can't really take nicotine gum, and I can't focus when I get cravings. I'm also 17 and don't have a part time job anymore so the only quitting stuff I can afford is the gum, patches are too expensive. (If you're wondering how I can afford cigarettes and not patches, I literally have resorted to bumming them off strangers and pocketing them.) Any advice?

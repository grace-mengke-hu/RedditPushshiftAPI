2 weeks achieved!

Feeling really good at the 2 week mark.

I had a few rough patches around day 8 and 9 with some intense cravings. But I pulled through and stuck with my vow of not touching a cigarette ever again. 

This week I plan on starting to ease myself into running and work on getting my cardio back in shape.

I can say that I feel better than ever now!

Time to stop this insanity!!

So, from tomorrow I want to stop. This will be my 100th attempt probably,  but I'm very determined.  I'm so tired with smoking after 18 years of chain smoking.  This year I already have managed to stop twice for 2 months each time.  But unfortunately I didn't stay stopped.  Wish me  luck, guys.  I know that you understand what I feel and my fear. I also wish success and strength to everyone who struggles at the moment.

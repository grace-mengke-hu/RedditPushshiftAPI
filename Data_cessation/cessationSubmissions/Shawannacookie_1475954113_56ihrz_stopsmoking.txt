Smoking causing a rift in our relationship

Ok so I haven't officially quit smoking or anything. I mean I want to do it for my fianc√© even though I really enjoy doing it ( yay for addictions right?!?) but every time I even just think about doing it the anxiety just gets me it's like I pysch myself out of doing it. The actual smoking is causing serious trouble in our relationship. We almost never argue except about this he's trying to force me to quit: he'll hid my stuff, empty my lighters, he'll cut my packs, on one occasion he pushed me up against the wall and foricibly took them out of my hand and I'm giving some serious kick back: I fight back verbally, I've walked out a couple times, name calling and on the occasion when he pushed me I raised my hand to hit him after he took my stuff ( I didn't actually hit him I caught myself and walked away). We've tried compromising like only smoking halves, having only like three a day, if he asks me to wait a little bit I do it,hiding it from his parents, trying different tobaccos etc. as of late it's just been getting unbearable we're arguing more frequently and just driving each other crazy. Does anybody have any similar experiences? What was the outcome? 

Edit: I don't expect people to side with me. And we're getting married in two months I really do love him and am excited about spending the rest of our lives together but I don't want to be having the same argument 20 years down the road.

Wellbutrin and my quit

Hi all, 
Coming to you 129 days into my second real attempt at quitting. I was a pack a day smoker for 11 years (16 -27yrs) and had one real attempt two years ago where I quit for about a month. After doing some research and talking to my PCP I decided to try taking Wellbutrin to help quit. With monthly med monitoring I took a low dose twice a day, starting two weeks before my quit date and continuing for a total of 90 days. I am now two weeks off the Wellbutrin and doing great. Honestly, I am so happy I decided to go this route as my main struggles have been dealing with the emotional highs and lows that come with quitting. The Wellbutrin helped with that!!! I have not seen a lot about this method on this sub so I thought I would post and let people know I'm here to help answer questions if Wellbutrin is a method you are considering! 

Keep going everyone!

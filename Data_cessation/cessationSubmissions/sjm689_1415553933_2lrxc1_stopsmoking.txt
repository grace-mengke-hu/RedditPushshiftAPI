12 years.

It's been 12 years, today.

You've been gone for 12 years. More than half my life has been without you. You smoked for most of your life, you wanted to quit but you never did. I remember seeing you sitting outside smoking and being told "No, don't go outside right now let Daddy smoke." You worked to put food on the table, and never complained because you loved your family. 

Then you were gone. 

It's been 12 years since you've died. You were 43, you left a wife who was 42, a daughter who was 12, and a son who was 8 behind. It was difficult at first but it became life. It became normal, I don't know what growing up with a Dad is like and it doesn't bother me so much anymore and I can't tell you if that's sad or not because it's just life.

Honestly the part that bothers me the most is that I can't even remember the sound of your voice.

If you're trying to quit, you can, it's hard I know, you will mess up I know, but just keep at it, please, if not for your family then do it for yourself.

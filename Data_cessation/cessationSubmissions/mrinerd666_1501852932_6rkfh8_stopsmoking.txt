Well that was the last of the pack

So yesterday I made my first post about setting a quit date for Sunday. This morning on the way to work I smoked the last one of the pack. Instead of buying a new pack I bought some patches....where we go. Wish me luck! And like to thank you guys in advance for possible craving posts.

Extreme rage

Hello all,

So this is day 11 on the patch and thus far it's going pretty well. I haven't had a puff (or even really had the desire to) since I quit. I'm also hitting the gym three times a day and eating a lot more fruit and veg/herbal tea, and I can already feel the physical improvements: my breathing is more or less back to normal, I can sustain activity for much longer and my smell and taste is returning to me.

However, this weekend I started to notice an emotional imbalance. I'm getting extremely angry/upset at people to the point where I want to flip out/yell at them. My reactions are disproportionate to the actions which are enraging. I'm noticing it's way more difficult to sustain inter-personal contact, and it's putting a strain on some of my closest relationships (w/roommate, gf, etc). I'm afraid it's going to start seeping into my workplace and cause me to blow up there in a fit of rage.

Do these feelings subside? How long will they last? I'm finding them really dehabilitating and I fear they'll keep getting worse. Are there any methods that I should use to work through the rage?

6 months smoke free. Huge cravings today. Help!

Hi friends. Everything was going good. Haven't smoked since 3/3 and I pretty much feel like a non smoker.

I'm dealing with a bunch of stress at home and work lately (I'm self employed with two kids) and today I have SUCH A HUGE URGE TO SMOKE A CIGERETTE. I'm not sure what's going on besides the stress with a hint of depression. Haven't seen or smelled anyone smoke today either...

Should I try some NRT? Gum, spray etc?

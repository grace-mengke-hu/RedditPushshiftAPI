Cotinine urine test in four days

I have a cotinine urine test for my life insurance in four days. I need to know if I will pass. I have been trying to quit smoking and managed to bring it down to about 8 a day for the last 3 months. I stopped briefly from Friday 31st July to 2nd August.

Then after that, I did another form of tobacco about 3-4 times a day (a form of tobacco that is considered to have twice the nicotine as one cigarette) from the 2nd until today, 4th August. My cotinine test is on the 9th August. 

Am I likely to pass? I can try to change the appointment, but it will not be easy.

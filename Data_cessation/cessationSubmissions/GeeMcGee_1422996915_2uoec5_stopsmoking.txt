3 days in - cold turkey - always tempted to use ecig

Hi there all


5 weeks ago I bought a nice ecig. Ive been using it since until last week I picked up a cold which then led into a chest infection so on Saturday I quit the ecig too. 

Right now I'm coming up to 72 hours cold turkey and the cravings are very real. I'm not using any nrt and feel like I shouldn't. But would it be wise to use the vape if only a little to ease cravings? Or will this essentially restart the clock on nicotine withdrawal?

Thanks. Hoping to make it to day 4 without cracking

6 freakin' months, I can't believe it.

Many times I had come into this sub, editing my flair so many times. I would set a quit day, wouldn't check back for a while, and my flair on here would be like 400 days or something, and then I would edit it to be my current 2 or 3 days of not smoking. Tried over and over to quit and quit and I could not do it. Finally, I was on a trip to Europe, and I smoked the last cigarette of my pack outside a hostel in Rome, on one of the last days of my trip. I said to myself, "would be pretty badass if the last cigarette I ever smoked was in Rome" and that was it. There is more to it than this, obviously, but it all happened kinda quick, I pretty much said fuck this I am done. I have not smoked a cigarette since. I have been around them many times, I have been offered them, and I have not accepted one. The closest I have come since that early drunk morning in Rome to smoking a cigarette is smoking one in a dream. I feel healthier, I smell better, my throat does not hurt, and smelling smoke no longer makes me want a cigarette, it grosses me out. I once quit for 44 days before smoking again, and it hurt my throat so bad, I can only imagine how awful it would be to smoke again after 6 months. Nothing inside of me wants one at all.

I am truly proud of myself for this. One of the hardest things about quitting for me was the fact I grew up smoking, started at maybe 12 years old. I thought because of that I would never get away from something I know so well, yet somehow I did. I am so happy I did it. I hope the rest of you can do the same. It really changed my life.

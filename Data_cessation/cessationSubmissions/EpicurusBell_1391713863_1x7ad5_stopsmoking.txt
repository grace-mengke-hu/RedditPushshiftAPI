Here I go.......

Alright! After 9 years and countless attempts to quit smoking I have committed to doing it....TODAY! Last night I let myself smoke as much as I wanted with no hesitation knowing that when I woke up this morning there will be no more. So here I go....What tips or advice can you share for the next few upcoming days/weeks? What can I expect and do you have any suggestions to help get past all the withdraw symptoms? thanks in advance!

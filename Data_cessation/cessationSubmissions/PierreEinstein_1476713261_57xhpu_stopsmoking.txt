1 week quit!

Hey everyone! First post :) I just made it to 7 days quit. I've tried to quit before but I've never felt this dedicated. After 17 years of smoking 2 packs a day I finally quit cold turkey.  I just turned 35 and decided I'd had enough. 

The biggest thing that helped was giving up coffee and booze as well! 

This sub has been a big inspiration! Thanks everyone!

Day 3 - Slept like crap, cravings through the roof

Hey guys, me again.

I slept really bad today, woke up almost every half hour or so. My morning coffee went down smooth, with a craving I deflected using the strategy I posted about yesterday. Afterwards, my friend who's place i slept at had to go to Uni and I went home.

That's when shit hit the fan for real. Jesus, the cravings. Like, three of them in half an hour, and all of them were at least 8/10s. It feels like I forgot why i quit and just have this nostalgic feeling towards cigarettes that makes me want to go out and buy a pack. I know that it's just my head because the nicotine should almost be gone from my body but the urge to have a smoke is huge.

Yesterday seemed easy compared to this, why is Day 3 such a hump?

Quitting for real this time

Hey y’all. I’ve been on and off here for a while but today I’m DETERMINED. I bought a box of patches and I’m done smoking cigarettes for good. My main reasons are 1) smoking is TOO expensive. I did the math and I was spending $56 a week on cigarettes. Bullshit. The patch seemed too expensive at first until I realized I’m still saving $42 a week. 2) I’m an androgyne, but I have a uterus and I want to bear children one day. I want to make sure nicotine isn’t going to cause any problems in a pregnancy when I’m older. (I’m only 18 now.) 3) Strength over addiction. I just hate how much these rolled up leaves control me and I’m not putting up with it anymore.

Wish me luck!

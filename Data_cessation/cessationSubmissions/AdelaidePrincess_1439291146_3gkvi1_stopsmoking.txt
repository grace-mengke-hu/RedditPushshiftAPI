day 3 and ready to go crazy

i go back to work tomorrow after 2 days off. i am on day three and am over the massive headaches and light headedness

tonight i sat at a friends place with two smokers and wasn't even tempted to have one. yay me!

but i am terrified of going back to work tomorrow and being around all those smokers on my breaks

any tips on how to deal with the headaches?

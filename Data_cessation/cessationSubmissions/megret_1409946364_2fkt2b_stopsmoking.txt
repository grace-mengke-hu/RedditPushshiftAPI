Finally being able to say "no" when the nurse asks if I'm a smoker....

I was at urgent care yesterday with a sprained ankle. The nurse doing intake was asking the usual. I was in a lot of pain, not really having a great day. She got to, "Are you a smoker?" I couldn't help but smile. "Nope! I quit two years ago!" She asked how long. "20 years! Three packs a day!" She said, "Good thing you quit, or you'd be here for more than your ankle!" 

It's so nice to not get that "You know better than that shit!" stare from nurses and doctors!

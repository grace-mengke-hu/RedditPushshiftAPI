It's finally time

My friend and I have decided that since we both just started summer that it is a great time to finally quit smoking. After 6 years it's been long enough and we both want to kick the habit and be healthier people, so by August 25th, the beginning of the next school year, we will have hopefully completely eliminated smoking from our lives. Wish us luck and good luck to all of those who are also in this journey with us.

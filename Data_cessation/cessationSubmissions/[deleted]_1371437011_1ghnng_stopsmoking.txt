Attempt #2

So I smoked from age 16 until age 23. I stopped smoking by exercising whenever I felt like a smoke. Turns out I liked exercising so much, that I became a personal trainer. I stopped smoking for 2 years, except occasionally while drinking.. Which was a lot over the Christmas just gone. I've been smoking ever since and have tried stopping a few times, unsuccessfully. 

Decided to come look for some back up. I know I can do it, because I have before.. But that doesn't make it any easier. It's only my 2nd day and I feel like I could snap and climb a clock tower with a rifle at any moment.

I'm not a PT anymore, and haven't exercised consistently since last year. I'm at university studying journalism and I work at a supermarket in the mean time. 

I agreed to go into work today, despite really not wanting to. I'm in a horrible mood and am afraid I'll bite customers and coworkers heads off. I leave in 20 minutes and will be back in 4 hours.

Just wanted to rant and vent. It's good to give my fingers something to do, other than smoking.

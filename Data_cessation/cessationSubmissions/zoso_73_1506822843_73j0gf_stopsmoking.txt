Suggestions for cold turket

I'm a 24 year old male who smokes casually 2-3 cigs a day and have been smoking on and off for the last 3 years. I am always trying to quit using patches, but seem to crave the actual smoking, and relapse time and time again. I'm determined to quit cold turkey, but would like to hear suggestions and input. I typically smoke to and from work, and occasionally on lunch breaks.

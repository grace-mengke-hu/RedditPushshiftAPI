I fucked around and got addicted to nicotine. Send help.

So this kid in my class bought me a juul (for those that don’t know it’s an e cigarette) a couple of months ago for no reason....  anyway at first I told myself I’d only use it when I was drinking but then I liked the buzz and started doing it almost everyday and now I smoke it all the time. I threw it away a week ago so I’d stop but I couldn’t control myself and bought one again and now I know for sure I’m addicted to nicotine and don’t know what to do. How do people stop? I know cigarette smokers smoke e cigs or vapes when they’re trying to get rip of smoking but I’ve never smoked cigs just the e cig what’s the best thing to use in replacement of the e cig as I slowly try take myself away from nicotine? Or any advice?

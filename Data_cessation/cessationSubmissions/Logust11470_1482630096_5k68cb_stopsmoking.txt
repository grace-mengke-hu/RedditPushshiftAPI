Switched to e-cig 4 years ago. Considering switching to a patch. Thoughts?

I smoked my last "real" cigarette 4 years ago. Prior to that I had been a pack a day smoker for 20 years. 

I switched over to an e-cigarette with 18mg pre-filled cartomizers. Never looked back and never felt the need to light up. 

Now, I'd line to wean myself off completely. I have been thinking about switching over to a patch and then step down from there. Any tips or suggestions?

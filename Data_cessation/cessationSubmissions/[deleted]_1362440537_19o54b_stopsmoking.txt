Wtf

Ok I am 15 days in and going with lit any patches, or e cigs as of today. I snapped earlier today. So I took a nap, just trying to not be doing things that scare those around me. I wake up, my wife rips me a new one. And sticks a pack of my brand in my face saying I'm too much of an ass as a quiter, and to start again now.... I covered my eyes with my hands and just repeated get he fuck away....am I in a special kind of hell?

My Dad has a medical condition. His doctors insist he quits smoking. He's sneaking some. Anything I can do?

My dad is 74 and has been smoking since he was 14.  He always had kidney problems, but now he's only at ~15% kidney function.  The doctors told him to quit.  He lives with my brother and even though my brother can be a pain, he effectively nagged my dad to quit.  My sister moved into his house who is a smoker.  With her around the house and cigarettes being available to him, he's been sneaking a few in.  I'm not sure how many a day or if it's even a daily thing.  There is no talking to my sister about changing her behavior (she has problems of her own).  Is there anything my brother and I can do to help our dad stay away from cigarettes?  We're all grown ups so I don't want to be in the business of telling people to change, but I would hate to see him undo any progress with something so controllable.

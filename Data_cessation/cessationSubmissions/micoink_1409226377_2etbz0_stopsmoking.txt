5 days in. Is it normal to have a fever?

I decided to stop smoking(cold turkey) last saturday. I had the worst craving on the 3rd day but decided to play ball instead. The next day I felt lethargic and somewhat weak and decided to walk it off rather than lighting up a stick. And now I have this feverish chills but no desire to smoke. Am I going through "nicotine withdrawal"? Thanks in advance.

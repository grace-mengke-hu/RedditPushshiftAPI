26 years old. Been smoking for 10 years, menthol for the last 5. Today is the first day of the rest of my life, I am done.

I started off loving smoking, for a good couple years. After that, the "delicious" cigs started to come fewer and farther in between. Pretty much now-a-days I only light up because the addiction in me sayd that this cig will be a good one. Maybe the first drag is OK, but after that and especially after I am done my nose gets clogged and my throat gets nasty sore and phlegmy. (Sorry for the detail). But anyways I found this subreddit and really think it to be a great idea to post here with people in the same boat for support. First thing I know is going to happen is I am going to need something to replace smoking with, and my current replacement is finger foods, etc. Not sure if I am gonna blow up fat or what, but anything is better than what could happen to me if I keep smoking! Any tips wold be greatly appreciated. Thank you all in advance!

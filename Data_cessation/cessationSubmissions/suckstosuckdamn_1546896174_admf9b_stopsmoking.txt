Tips not not smoking while driving?

I've read several places that an effective way of not smoking is to eliminate those areas where you go to smoke. for me however, that area is my car. I would love taking a smoke on the way to school/work (same location).

I've smoked for about 3 1/2 years now. I was never seriously into cigarettes, but would smoke black and milds (little cheap mini-cigars). can anyone offer some advice on how i can get into something else while I drive?

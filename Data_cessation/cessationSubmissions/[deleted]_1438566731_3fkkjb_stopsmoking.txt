I've lost pretty much all interest in cigarettes

Its funny cause I wasn't even trying to quit, but over the past few months I went from smoking pack/day to barely a pack/week. Some days I don't even smoke at all. I have just lost interest in cigs, the act of smoking is boring to me now. I don't derive enjoyment out of it like I used to. I still have 3/4 of my pack left that I bought last week and I don't think I can finish it. Whenever I light up I feel like putting it out after a couple drags. I guess this would be a good time to quit lol

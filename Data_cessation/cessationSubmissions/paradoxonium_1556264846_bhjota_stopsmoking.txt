Need advice and encouragement to stop smoking.

Hello everyone, I joined this subreddit recently to quit smoking as advised by my cardiologist because my triglyceride levels are 238 mg/dl whereas the normal level should be below 160 mg/dl. Also, when he used the stethoscope, he found that I was wheezing and recommended that I should use an inhaler and it might get worse in the upcoming days. He strictly recommended me not to smoke. Also, I found out that my stamina has totally gone haywire. I decided that I won't smoke from 25th of April (yesterday), and today its my day 1 of not smoking. But here's my dilemma. I used to smoke everyday after major meals/snacks and while having coffee/tea. What should I do at those times when the urge kicks in? The urge from morning has come many times, and it is very hard to cope up with it. I am having withdrawal symptoms already. Also, where I live, vapes are very costly, so its not feasible for me to afford them right now. Seeing everybody's success stories here makes me so happy and I want to get there, too. I would appreciate some feedback/advice. Regards!

Getting belligerant

I will NEVER smoke again, but I am getting pissed off with the do-gooders and Alan Carr fan club and everyone one else waving a flag for their "method". My sister told me on the weekend that after 22 years of not smoking she still wants one. 22 years!!!! That impresses me more than any Alan Carr bull. If she can still want one after 22 years, I guess it's okay for me to want one after 142 days, but not have one. I am not a smoker any more, but it doesn't mean I don't think like one. People who try to tell me otherwise piss me off...

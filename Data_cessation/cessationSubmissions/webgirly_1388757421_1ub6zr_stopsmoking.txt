Advice on flavoured vapourisers/e-cigs

Hi all!  


I like the idea of switching out most of my rollies to vaporisers, particularly the flavoured ones, but I'm not sure which to go with.

I don't seem to be able to find what specific ingredients are within the oily suspension for the nicotine/flavouring.  

I realise this might vary from brand to brand - if anyone knows what their specific brand holds, I'd be very interested to know.  Also, I'm not even bothered if it carries nicotine, I think the flavoured vape alone will be enough.

What works for me

So first off I am using the 21mg patch. I’m due to step down in 3 days, the physical withdraw was far too much for me. But besides the patch I’ve changed my morning routine, the place where i use to have coffee I now go to my kitchen table instead. Reading current news, listening to music as I wake.  No more going to my spot to smoke.  

Next was keeping a daily journal, this journal is by my side most the day to write everything I’m going through, this way i can look back and see where I can improve or be proud! 

I have shopped for fresh fruits they seem to be better than all the chocolate i was eating. Snacking is huge when you quit, moderate or there will be an increase in weight. Lollipops i love and and I have nicotine gum for emergency cravings. Other snacks are pretzels (the rods are perfect for hand to mouth cravings), any type of mint candy to keep a strong fresh taste. Cigarettes have such an awful taste and smell, its good to keep your breath nice and fresh as another reminder!! 

Some other things I incorporated where to walk 1 mile a day, its a low pace goal but for a 25 yr smoker its the best start in the world, i went to the mall last night and did 3.2 miles. Didn’t even realize it!!  Walking really helps remember why I quit, to breath better. 
I am also in my garden weeding or grooming my plants. Being a housewife you have to keep busy. Besides indoor daily chores, mix it up some! 

Reading, camping, biking some other little things I have observed my husband doing when he was quit. 

The last thing I do which is so juvenile but turned out to be my high point was I put a sticker on the calendar for each day I didn’t smoke, turned out when I had a relapse I looked back and saw how many I accumulated that I just didn’t want to give up, I wanted my sticker!!  😊😁 

Hope this helps! Good luck 🍀 to everyone struggling today.

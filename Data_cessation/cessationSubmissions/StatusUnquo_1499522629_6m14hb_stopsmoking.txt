Gonna give it a try

Hi everyone!  I'm new to this sub, but I figured I'd give it a shot.  I smoke a pack a day, and I hate it.  It stinks, it's expensive (just moved to a place where packs are more than $10 apiece), it's inconvenient, and I have an annoying cough that I am sure will go away if I quit.  I just made it eighteen hours before I gave in and bought more.  I think what I did wrong was not put on a nicotine patch this morning, wanting to see if I could do without.  Once I finish these two packs, I'll try again and use the patches for a longer period.

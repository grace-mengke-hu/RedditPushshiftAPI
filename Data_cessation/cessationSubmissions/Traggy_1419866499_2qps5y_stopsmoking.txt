180 days!!! 6 star baby!

Humble Brag.  Haven't had anything for 180 days and the craving's are far and few between and nothing more than a brief annoyance if even that anymore.  

It is great to be free!  Keep your head up! Stay positive!  You are in control even if it doesn't feel like it some of the time.  Remember, you are having cravings because you are winning!

E cigarettes

Hi Guys, So i quit smoking one week ago because i read the e cigarettes are only 5% as unhealthy as cigarettes. So i gave it a go and no i didnt smoke a cigarette for one week! Iâ€˜m a little bit proud but i know thats not everything. So i want to quit e cigarettes with nicotine too but continue with liquid without nicotine and in the end quit smoking or vaping completely. What do you think when its the best time to quit with nicotine after breaking the habit of normal cigarettes? Please help me guys :) thanks and good luck to everyone in this subreddit

I'm 17 days clean and dear god I'm so sick... Has this happened to any of you?

Starting April 1st I quit smoking and caffeine. Not having either of these isn't bothering me in a craving way but I'm so sick. I have had bronchitis and flu like symptoms for over 2 weeks. It happens every time I quit for a week or so. I'm constantly coughing and have gone through like a hundred cough drops the last 2 weeks and nothing is helping my cold really (I'm on antibiotics too). I'm half tempted to smoke just to take this cough away. How many of you have experienced this? How long does it last?

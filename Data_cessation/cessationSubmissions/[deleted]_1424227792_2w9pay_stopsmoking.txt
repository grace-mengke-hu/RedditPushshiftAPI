Been on the sub for 30 seconds. Read nothing. How do I quit...

I woke up feeling sick. 
Took a shower and coughed a bit but it felt good on my lungs.
Got dressed, went down stairs and I got the urge to take a shit.
Walked into the bathroom and started coughing uncontrollable. Felt like I was about to die. Threw up and went to work.

Got in the car and didn't have a cigarette on the drive.
Did some truck maintenance but still couldn't light one up.
Drove to the job site. *spark*

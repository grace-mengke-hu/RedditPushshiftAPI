Wanting a smoke after supper..ughhh

So today is day 1 for me trying to kick this habit and I have been fine all day except for right now after eating supper! I'm so used to immediately going outside and sparking one up as soon as I rinse my plate off in the sink and it took alot of willpower to not go outside today. Anyone else have this trigger too?

Nicotine-free vape &amp; quitting cold turkey

I've been a heavy smoker for over 20 years (smoking since 15). I quit cold turkey At the beginning if this year, after struggling for years. I found that having nicotine free vape really helped. For the first month, I was puffing on my vape like an addict. I've naturally relying less on my vape, maybe twice a day at max.

I'm posting because nothing else worked for me before. I tried gum and patches. This won't work for everyone, but nicotine free vape really helped me quit cold turkey.

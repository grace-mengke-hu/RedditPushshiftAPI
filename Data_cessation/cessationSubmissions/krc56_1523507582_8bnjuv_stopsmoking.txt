Terrible Smoking Dreams!

Has this happened to anyone else? Every night I have these awful dreams about lighting up. After I smoke in each dream, I experience terrible feelings of regret and disappointment. I guess it is comforting that even my dream-self is disappointing in relapsing. The worst part about the dreams is that the inhale is so real. I wake up inhaling like I did when I used to smoke. I really hope these go away soon. 77 days and they're getting worse!

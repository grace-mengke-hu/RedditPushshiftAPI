Experience with Zyban or Chantix?

First, congratulations to all who have begun their journey kicking this addiction and thanks for taking a few moments to read my question.

Does anyone have experience with prescription smoking cessation drugs such as Zyban, Chantix or any other cessation prescription?   If anyone could share their thoughts, successes, costs, ect...

Did your insurance cover it?  If so, was it indefinitely or was it limited?  If it worked for you, was it immediate or over a period of weeks/months?  Did you have side effects, if so where they enough to make you stop taking it or were they manageable.

**[Edit]  Thank you all for contributing.  My father is a very heavy smoker that, after major Aorta surgery, needs to stop smoking and I want to discuss these options with him and his doctor.**

Again, thanks for taking whatever time you have to help me understand these prescriptions.  Thanks!

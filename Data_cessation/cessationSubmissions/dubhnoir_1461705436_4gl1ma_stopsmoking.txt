Three weeks today and mouth question

After six years, I threw out a full pack of cigarettes three weeks ago and haven't looked back. In all, I feel great -- breathing better, circulation's better, so much more energy. Hell, I even lost weight because I'm excited to get out, walk, and take in fresh air.

I do have a question though. Anyone else have sore gums when they quit? I've avoided most of the physical symptoms, but man by gums feel like they're on fire!

Worth it though. Fight on...

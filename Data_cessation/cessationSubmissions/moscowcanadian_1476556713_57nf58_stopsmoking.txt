Guess who's back back back....

Ok I'm back to day 1 ONCE AGAIN. I have been very bad whenever there is alcohol available, I really can't seem to control myself once I've had a few drinks! So what to do? **Don't drink!** Probably not forever, but I will take a little break for the time being in order to control myself. Other than that I will be going cold turkey this time around, my most successful quit to date was started on the patch, however my recent quits in the past few weeks have been with the patch and have not worked, so cold turkey it is. Here I go!!

Stay on the alert

So I stopped smoking in 2005 and went smoke free until April 2013, for a stupid reason I had couple of ciggies with my mates.... in no time I became a smoker again, struggled to give up throughout last year and this year.... Managed each time to go a month without nicotine then being thinking I have now everything under control, allowing myself this one cigarette with a coffee and then straight back into full time nicotine addiction. So this time I'm going to make it so far 32 days without a ciggie, but this time I'm staying vigilant to these silly thoughts "that one wouldn't hurt" it bloody will !!!!

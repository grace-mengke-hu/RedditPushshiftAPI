Long time lurker, first time poster.

Man, there's a subreddit for everything. I'm glad I thought to search this, because after looking at everyone's posts, I feel like this is a good community that will be able to help. I'm only 22, but I've been smoking since I was 16. First started off as a social smoker, but gradually grew to be habitual. The worst part is, I think I mainly smoke for the oral fixation. I need to be doing something with my hands/mouth. I smoked my last cigarette two nights ago when the Spurs lost to the Heat (native San Antonioan), and it's been rough. I keep trying to reach for my pack when I'm headed to work, only to find that it's empty. I left my last pack there as a reminder, I guess. 

Sorry if this was a wall of text, but it's not to be able to talk about these things on here. I can never face anyone I know to tell them how I feel.  Anyway, I'm glad to be here. I mainly want to quit because I have asthma, and certain medications that I take (non-asthma related) mixed with smoking can cause blood clots. I've tried to quit in the past, but as you can see, it doesn't last very long. The last time I 'quit' lasted about two weeks. So here's to hopefully a better life. Going to get back into the gym, eat healthy, and salvage my lungs.

6 days in and I’ve got questions

On day 6. I smoked about a pack a day for 5 years, my wife and I quit cold turkey because we would like to start a family and we always promised ourselves we’d quit when we wanted to start trying. 

The first 4 days were just a constant ache in my head and a constant craving and I felt like I could handle that but the 5th and 6th days are worse. I feel fine for most of the day but I’ll get a craving for about 30 minutes that is ten times worse then the first days, then it goes away for a few hours. I also keep having this crazy idea that as soon as I’m done quitting I can have a cigarette which is wild I know. It’s just hard to realize it’s FOREVER when your craving. Does anybody else feel like it’ll be over and you can start smoking again?

Habit is a big thing for me. I find myself sitting outside for no reason or standing in front of buildings as if I’m smoking. It seems to help me if I tell myself I’m having a smoke break even if I’m not smoking lol. 

My biggest thing is that my career is very stressful and I’ve been having stress neck pain for about 6 months. When I smoked it was just kinda like a sore muscle that I would rub every once in awhile. But since I’ve quit the pain just gets worse and worse every day. Today it felt like I pulled a muscle or broke my neck, I could hardly move it all day. Was nicotine helping hide the pain? Is it getting worse because I’m stressing about not smoking? Did smoking actually help me de-compress and now my stress is building back up with out it? Did anyone else experience stress muscle pain when quitting? 

Sorry it’s such a long post and thanks for listening. Any feedback would be appreciated.

It's been about 32 hours since I quit.

I gotta say so far I'm doing ok. It gets hard at moments cause everyone else in my family smokes and they do it inside, I've made a makeshift "cigarette" with a straw and a "filter" done with tissue paper to distract me from the cravings and it's working surprisingly well so far, I call it my Wilson. I'm actually enjoying feeling hunger again.

So glad I found this subreddit...in desperate need of support!

Basically, I quit cold turkey after a month and a half of weaning myself via chain smoking the e-cig/1 to 3 real ones a day. And that's after solid 10 years of smoking close to a pack a day. 

Struggling with cravings and emotions, friends and family are minimally invested in my "sobriety" and are generally short of supportive; they mean well, just not living it like I am in real-time. I am having one hell of a time people!

What kind of suggestions or pro-tips do people have for this point in the game? It's the furthest I've ever made it without cheating and I don't want to ruin it now!

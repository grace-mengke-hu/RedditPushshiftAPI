Any advice for someone wanting to move from smoking to vaping to quitting.

Any suggestions where to look for a cape that is and what I should be looking for. Currently around a half pack a day. Unless drinking. 

(Used to be full pack- and quit several times). 

Like the thought of just getting the hit without the known nasties involved.

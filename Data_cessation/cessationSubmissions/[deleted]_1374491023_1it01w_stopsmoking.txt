My motivations

I really enjoy the fact that I haven't smoked for the past 3 months, here are the mental tricks that I've collected from Alan Carr's book and /r/stopsmoking that work for me:  
  
- **I will always be a smoker**. I cannot have my guard down, addiction is waiting just around the corner.  

- **If I smoke one more cigarette I will die.** It might not be instant, but I will relapse and fall into the addiction trap again  

-  **I don't enjoy smoking.** It's a trick my mind tries to play on me. What can be enjoyable in getting your mouth and your lungs filled with smoke?  
- **What have you learned with Insanity Wolf?** GRRR.. bite the bullet  
  

I keep telling myself this crap while I look at the screen of my Android app every single day. Best of luck to everyone, you guys helped me a lot so far. <3

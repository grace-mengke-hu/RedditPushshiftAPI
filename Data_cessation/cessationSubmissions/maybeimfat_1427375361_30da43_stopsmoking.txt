It's been about 120 days. For the first time I had a dream where I was smoking cigarettes.

It was like some kind of noir film. I dreamt last night that I had completely given up on life, and started smoking and doing drugs again.

It was surreal. It wasn't a nightmare per'se, and it was ultra realistic. No talking cheesewheels or floating brains or anything weird. Just a very realistic dream of depression where I decided to start smoking cigarettes again because I had given up.

I don't know why I'm posting this, maybe just to get it off my chest. This has never happened before. 

I am happy to have quit smoking cigarettes, but I guess the truth is, if I found out the world was going to end tomorrow I'd probably go buy a carton. Fortunately the world will continue, and so will I!

Stay strong brothers and sisters, quitting smokes is the best thing you can do for yourself.

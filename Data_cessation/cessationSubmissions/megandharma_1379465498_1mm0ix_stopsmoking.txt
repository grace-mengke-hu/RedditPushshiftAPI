I'm so disappointed in myself. Can't seem to stay quit to save my life. Maybe I really do need a crisis to stay quit. [A rant and fresh start.]

I "quit" about a month and a half ago. I did really well for about two weeks, but then I would have a puff or two, even a whole cig or two while out drinking. This past weekend I really went all out and bought a pack and have been smoking ever since. I could make a bunch of excuses to make myself feel better, but really I just blew it.

I really wish I hadn't started smoking 7 years ago. Sitting here now I can smell how awful I smell. It's on my fingers, my hands, my cardigan, my hair, and the gods know my breath is fowl.

There are 7 smokes left in the pack. I'm so fed up with this habit and my behavior. I'm throwing them away.

I just told my best friend how I'm feeling. I also told her that I cannot have even one more puff. None. Zero. Nadda. 

I'm so tired of this addiction. My brain keeps telling me it's good, but when I do it.. it just doesn't feel that way. More recently this past year with my struggle to quit. 

I keep letting myself, SO, friends and family down. I keep saying "I QUIT, YAY ME!" only to turn right back around a couple weeks or a month later. It needs to stop!!

Thanks for reading. I just needed to get this crap off my chest. I'm quitting again. Here's hoping I'll never need to quit again.

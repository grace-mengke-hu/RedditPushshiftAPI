Been smoking since 1998. Thinking of finally quitting for real.

The last time I tried to quit, it was about 3 years ago. After about two weeks I started coughing uncontrollably. Like every 5 minutes I would have a fit to where my face would turn completely red and it was almost impossible to get any work done. After 3 full days of this and not getting hardly any sleep I bought a pack on the 4th day and after that first cig the coughing went away almost instantly. It was horrible and cough syrup and cough drops were not helping at all. I want to quit again but is there anything I can do to keep this from happening again?

My biggest trigger is...

my daughters dad.  Everytime I hear my daughter say something about what hes said about me or what he is going to do whilst not giving me any money for child support, forcing me into a situation where I have to work 3 jobs and take him to court i just want to buy a box and have a good smoke.

He is the main excuse ive used not to give up for years.

Right now in this moment I feel like crying and just giving up being a non smoker becasue i've no odea how im supposed to deal with all his nonsense for the next i years with out having something to escape from my feelings with.

Posting on here and hoping you all or anyone can help?  

I dont want to smoke but how do you all cope when that one thing that tips you over the edge everytime happens?

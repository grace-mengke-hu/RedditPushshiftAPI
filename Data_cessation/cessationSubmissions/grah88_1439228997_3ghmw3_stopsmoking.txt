I made it folks 808 days.

I would like to thank each and everyone of you. I never really posted much, but trust me I was lurking. Reading all the stories getting motivation. Now my home has no remnants of a smoker. Just last month everyone was confused because I had no lighters for the 4th of July. Anyways you all can do it.

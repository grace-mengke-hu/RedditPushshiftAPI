What was your reason to quit? (5 days smoke free!!)

I'm 5 days smoke free today. 5th time trying to quit and each time it seems to get easier. But at the same time... Damn it is hard! 

But was curious... What was your reason for quitting? Besides money and for better health for me it was because my toddler son was starting to pay attention to them. I remember as a child seeing my parents smoke and thinking it was ok to do so once you were an adult. How wrong I was lol!! But my son is my motivation, I want to be able to provide him a life he deserves, be healthy and around for him and be able to set a better example.

Thanking this sub for the help

Today It's my birthday and the more than 1 month without smoking is the best gift I could give myself. I wanted to thank everyone in this subb, I know I have a long way to go, but this one month has been made easier by reading the stories shared here our seeing other people's progress. Thank you :)

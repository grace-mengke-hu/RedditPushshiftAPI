Girlfriend is pregnant, how do I get her to stop smoking?

She is 23, and is about 2 weeks pregnant (unexpected) and has told me she has not plans to quit. We currently live in England UK.

1) UK stoppers, what support/services would you recommend for me to get for her? 

2) How bad exactly is smoking while pregnant (I know its bad, learnt it in School GCSEs), anybody have any experiences with smoking future mothers? 

3) Generally, how hard is it to stop smoking? I've never touched the things in my life, so have no clue. 

Edit - Not 2 weeks pregnant, we've known for 2 weeks. She's about 1 1/2 months.

A never-ending tale of quitting smoking

So I'm a 32 years old guy, who smokes roughly a pack a day. I hate it, the morning cough, smelly clothes, feeling worse with each passing year and all the money I wasted on cancer sticks. Yet every day I buy them, fucking insane, a seemingly endless vicious circle. You know the drill. I tried to quit couple of times in the last 2 years with my record cloaking in a month of being smoke free. That was 1,5 year ago, the first time with the help of a drug called Desmoxan in my country (Poland). Since then I've tried using it again, gave a chance to different meds with the same active ingredient, took Zyban and nothing worked. Maybe I was smoking less, but the demon had to be fed. Tommorow I'll try again, till then I have couple of Marlboro Lights left. Wish me luck, give the best tips you've got.

Looking for support - a few weeks quit, and it's getting harder for stupid reasons

I'm past the point where a chemical dependency is driving any cravings. I can smell again, my lungs don't feel heavy, my throat doesn't hurt, I can kiss my wife.

Like all the other times I've quit, I'm in dangerous territory; the hesitance to smoke is gone because I'm not immediately feeling the negative effects, but the behavioral cues and triggers are still there: boredom at work, stress, etc etc. A part of my mind is formulating this lie that I could just go buy a pack and enjoy one every now and then, though history and common sense both tell me that's a ridiculous train of thought.

I'm maintaining for now, but could use some encouragement - anyone else ever go through times like these?

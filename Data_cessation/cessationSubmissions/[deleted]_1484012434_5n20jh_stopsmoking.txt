Let's try this again...

I apparently suck at posting things. 

Anyway...

When my husband steps outside for a smoke... rage. Blind rage. I know I'm better off not smoking, but he makes this so. fucking. difficult. 

I'm a few hours short of a week smoke free and all I want to do is break. I won't. But I WANT to.

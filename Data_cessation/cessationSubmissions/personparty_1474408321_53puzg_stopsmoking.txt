What are some quitting symptoms going cold turkey versus nrt?

So this is my millionth quit this year and I finally decided that cold turkey isn't working for me, so I'm quitting with nrt (vaping, which I know is a contentious issue in this sub, but that's not the point). 

I'm wondering, since I'm still ingesting nicotine, I'm not really going through withdrawal, but I'm still experiencing some common quit symptoms like nausea and headaches. Is this due to all the other crap that's in cigs, or am I just feeling ill by pure coincidence?

Love to know some different experiences out there.

1 Year Down - I learned a Lot

I learned I didn't smoke for any of the reasons I thought I did.

I learned that my addiction to nicotine was used against me to reinforce my reasons for smoking. (I confused withdrawl relief with all the other reasons to smoke)

At the end of the day, I smoked for withdrawl reflief. PERIOD

I learned that quitting smoking "incentives" had nothing to do with saving money, better health, inconvenience, social stigma etc..
Reminding me about those things didn't make me quit, because I never smoked for any of those reasons in the first place.

I learned that by reading this guys book and watching this video. I had to watch it daily for the first few weeks, but, I got it. And once I got it, the rest was pretty easy.

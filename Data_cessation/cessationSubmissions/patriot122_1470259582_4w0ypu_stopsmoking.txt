Quitting today. Man it feels good to say that

Hey everybody. I'm not what you'd consider a long term smoker (3 years), but I've had enough. I'm tired of the lack of energy, tired, winded, and it's not helping my skin. I've been reading Allan Carr's book and it's been a great help!

I'm 28 now, but back in high school and college I was an athlete. I had a natural ability to run fast. I was in the best shape of my life and full of confidence. Once I got into college and started partying, I drunkely decided to smoke butts and it went all down hill from there. I stopped working out and I haven't ran in years

Thinking about how I let myself go really upsets me. I was on top of the world physically. I wish I never started smoking these things. There is really no point to them. You gain nothing from them physically. Science has shown wine in moderation can be good for the heart. Some studies show a beer can be good for you in moderation. And course there's  medicinal marijuana. But, tobacco is the one legal vice that you gain nothing from. I hate it, I hate myself for picking the habit it up.

 I swore up and down when I was younger I'd never smoke a cigarette. Well look at me now. I'm done smoking these "I hate myself sticks".

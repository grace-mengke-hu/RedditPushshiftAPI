Well, a whole year has passed and I haven't smoked or used nicotine even once.

A year ago today, I woke up determined to not smoke. Through every craving that passed, and every night ruined by exposure early on, I never took another puff. I think that I now have the freedom that I wanted for so many years. It's such a great relief and I have gotten so much back that I doubted I could have again or that I had forgotten about completely. 

Thanks, /r/stopsmoking. Victory smells good.

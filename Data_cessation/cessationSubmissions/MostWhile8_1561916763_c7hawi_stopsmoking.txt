Starting!!!!

My wondeful mother bought me the patches and I asked her to take my juul! So best case I will be weaned off to avoid my own severe anxiety mixing with withdrawal and once I’m at school and off the patches it should be easy to just quit considering I’m no longer rooming with someone who also vapes. Also in both the state I go to school in and where my family is the age is over 21 so there’s no chance of me going out and buying on. It also distances me from my dad so one day in and I am over the moon! I am getting mild headaches and I learned through the night that i’m absolutely not gonna wear the dumb thing at night (some weird fuckin dreams) but I usually vape first thing in morning and I woke up ok!!! Eventually, I know I can do this!!!

Oops, but not to bad.

Don't exactly know if I'm bragging or proud or embarrassed. I'm only in less than a couple weeks but I had a few glasses of wine and some drama on Wednesday and bummed a smoke from my bro, felt like shit the rest of the night ( wasn't that long as it was a like an hour before  I passed out. I fell asleep thinking that I had fuckt up big time and would wake up and keep smoking.  But I was fine. The craving was there but nowhere near like the the first two days. I think I might be really done. I'm still trepadatious because I had stopped smoking for months the last time I tried and got drunk and bought a pack of cigarettes had half a pack when I woke up the next day and threw all that time out the window just to dig into the pit of addiction first thing in the morning.  It's now Sunday and I haven't had one an I see people smoking or smell it and even though it really is gross I still want to join in. I've become much more antisocial, not on purpose but my roommate best friend and his wife stink to me now. I miss smoking because it was something to do while we talked, especially during tough moments we would ask each other to go have a smoke so we could talk in private.  But now I can't sit and watch tv with them because they stink and I still want to stink with them.

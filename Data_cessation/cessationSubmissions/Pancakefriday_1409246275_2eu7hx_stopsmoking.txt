Anyone find they get over-emotional when they try to quit?

Hello, I'm 22 and I'm trying to quit again. I started smoking when I was 14, and the only time I quit was for 3 months when I was 16. This is day 2 for me in one of my first attempts, and I notice that I haven't gotten irrationally angry at all yet, but that almost everything makes me want to tear up. Like random songs, not very tear-jerking scenes in movies.

Has anyone else experienced this?

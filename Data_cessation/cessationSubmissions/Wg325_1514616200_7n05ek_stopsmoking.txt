Tested and failed

After 1 year smoke free I thought I could dabble in occasional casual social smoking.  Figured "as long as I'm not buying them I am fine." Well, I knew better, but the old addiction convinced me otherwise. Started buying my own packs about 2 weeks ago. Now I find myself at the beginning of a long and frustrating road I have already been down.  Quitting is a bitch. Don't do it more than you have too.

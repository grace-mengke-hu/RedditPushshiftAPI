Can’t stop crying

I’m now on Day 24 and I feel amazing physically, but mentally I am going round the bend. I have cried every day for a week. And not little cries, but snotty, slobbery, sobbing cries. The sort of cries that give you a headache. And not even about anything in particular. The rest of the time I am grumpy and cranky and very quick to anger. I hate this, but I recognise it is a sign my body is fighting my addiction. It is just so annoying and I want to feel good in my brain!

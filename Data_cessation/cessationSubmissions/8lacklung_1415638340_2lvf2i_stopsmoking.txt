Day One of Ten Years

Hi Everyone, 

I'm a neophyte redditor. I feed the perpetual fire of cute kittens and infinity GIFS, but now I feel it is time for some personal growth and maturity. 

I am 26, I started smoking when I was 15. I must give a disclaimer - I do not smoke cigarettes. I smoke spliffs. For those who do not know what those are allow me: a spliff is equal parts tobacco and marijuana - maybe not equal depending on your mood. I have smoked like this since the age 15. Now, I am aware of the literature out there that speaks to the prolonged abuse of marijuana, especially in a developing brain, and how that can cause arrested development. I am at a stage in my life where I am at the precipice of my career path. I feel it is time for me to kick my stonerism habit, and mature into an adult. 

However, I have this nagging addiction to nicotine even though I don't smoke cigarettes. And my delivery system for tobacco is coupled with marijuana. I don't want to smoke cigarettes to cure my weed dependency, and I don't want to smoke only weed to cure my tobacco dependency. I want to not smoke. I want control over myself. 

So, amongst the kittens and GIFs I discovered this subreddit and I thought this is my time. This is also my first post. I am reaching out to all of you who have been through, or are going through what I am about to. Wish me luck, please post suggestions or words of support! 

Thank you,

Irregular sleep?

Hi guys, I've just recently joined the stopsmoking community as a 1 weeker! I couldn't smoke after my surgery so i used this opportunity to quit cold turkey. I'm still struggling with the cravings multiple times a day, but i can definitely feel the benefits! My throat isn't as tickly as it used to be, I can breathe better, and I definitely smell better (me and for other people who have to smell me).

One thing I wanted to ask was that is it normal to require less sleep? In the first 5 days I was dead tired and falling asleep at 8pm and waking up at 2am, and in the last 2 days it's been 1am - 7am (6 hours sleep).

Previously I've always found it a struggle to wake up at 8:30am for work (if I went to sleep at midnight) and would stagger in at 10am (I should have been fired A LONG TIME AGO but my work is super flexible about health issues). Now I can't help waking up naturally! Is this a long term side effect? Or is it just a withdrawal phase side effect?

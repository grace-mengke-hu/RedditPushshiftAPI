Been a while

Been a while since I posted but I just wanted to stop  in and remind you guys to stay vigilant. I'm almost at 2 years! To this day I don't really get cravings but the triggers are still there. Shitty days, horrible work shifts, emotional distress, a quick whiff of *my brand*. All of these things make the thought cross my mind that I could *really use* a cigarette. 

That's not true. What I could use is a deep breath or two of that *good good* oxygen with my lungs working in tip top shape. 

Anyway just wanted to say hi and stay vigilant, remember why you quit and don't hesitate to reach out to family and friends and talk about the tough time you're having, or just hop on by here. Love ya. ðŸ¥°

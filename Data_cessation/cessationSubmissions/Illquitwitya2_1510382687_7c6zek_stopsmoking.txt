I'm out too

Been smoking for about 11 years now. I've wanted to quit for a while (the absolute shit cigarettes here in West Africa certainly help make smoking unappealing), and saw that a good number of y'all are also calling it quits this weekend. I'm on board. Let's kick this shitty habit.

I've been reading through some posts on this sub and they have been super helpful. You guys are awesome. Thanks.

Quitting as of 9/17/17

I turned 30. I had switched to mostly vaping, but it was still an addiction that I didn't need anymore. So, I got rid of the vape and am taking a month off any alcohol to prevent cigarette relapse. Honestly, I feel ready. I used to panic without the nicotine, but something about planning it and making an active choice makes it better. I get testy with people, but I'm not NEEDING a cigarette. Not yet, at least.
I figure this is prime time to start taking care of myself a bit better. I used to be a great runner, so I'm training for the half marathon in April. Wish me luck, folks, and best of luck to all of you :).

It's time to let it go.

I started in my first semester in college. Before that I was healthy young guy. Been smoking for 6 years. I'll not let it become 7 years.

Smoking has made me look old and ugly. I breathe heavily. Haven't worked out in gym/outside since college and that's why I'm fat and sick.

Today I've decide to let it go. I'm an addict. Need to rehabilitate myself. If I get craving I'll look into the top and gilded section of this subreddit.

Thank you.

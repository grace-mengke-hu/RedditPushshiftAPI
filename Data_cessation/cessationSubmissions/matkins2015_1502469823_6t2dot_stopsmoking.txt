I am an ex-smoker who quit cigarettes easily once I knew how

I originally posted this as an AMA. But thought this would be a better place for this post...

I came across this method to quit cigs completely by accident. It involves dealing with the mental side -- the most important thing -- but easily. Anyone can do it really... if they really want to.

This method really questions the whole "quit smoking" industry and how -- as usual -- that industry could be more about money-making than actually helping and putting people first.

It can help a lot of people. if you are struggling to quit, just ask. I will reply asap.

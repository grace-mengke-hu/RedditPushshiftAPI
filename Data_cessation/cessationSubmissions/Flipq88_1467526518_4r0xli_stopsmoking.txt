Just want to say thank you

So,  I had been thinking about quitting for a few months now. I half assed it a few times by not buying cigs at night when I finished my pack,  then almost immediately give up the next day without much of a fight. I am 28 and had been smoking a pack a day since I was 18. I decided to quit about 5 days ago.  Like seriously quit.  I was half a day in and I was getting horrible cravings.  I decided to just google stuff like "how long until cravings stop" and other stuff related to smoking.  I was reading  a lot of old and new posts here on reddit.  Honestly,  all the positive comments and encouragement from people to complete strangers really helped me. I am now 4 hours shy of my 5 day mark and I am proud of not smoking.  I still get cravings like after I eat or when I am having a beer,  but nothing compared to the first day.  I just want to thank everyone here in this community,  shit seriously helped.  So thank you,  Here's to anyone who is reading this and thinking about quitting.  It can be done,  and if you all ever need encouragement this community is here for you

I want to quit, but I need help

I have a problem. I've been smoking for 10 years now and it's time I let go of this annoying, disgusting and expensive habit. It cost me my relationship of 7 years recently and I'm still destroyed over that. I've tried so many things already. Cold turkey quitting, replacing the habit with something else, nicotine patches, electric cigarettes. All of these work for a while, then I get back on smoking. It doesn't help that a lot of my coworkers smoke either. I should point out that it's the habit itself that is my problem, I personally haven't noticed any physical or mental side-effects from quitting during my previous attempts.

I've been to my doctor yesterday and all they said was "try cutting your smoking in half first". They don't want to try medication available because of my post-breakup despression (which flared up again after my ex told me just before christmas she wants to come back and it turned out yesterday that she doesn't after all), worries over my financial situation (I might lose my house as a result of the breakup) and all other crap going on. The possible side effects of the medication could mean I end up in a pine box, so yeah, no meds.

I just don't know how to really quit. Can anyone offer any advice? How do I kick this habit? Is it even possible right now?

almost 3 months in and still worried I might not be able to do this.

Today I was craving pretty hard on my way to work. My addict brain has been trying to justify just giving up all progress I've made and the time I've spent quit. I sometimes feel like I wish I never quit, though generally I'm ecstatic I did. I was able to curve my craving when I caught a whiff of the woman who was standing behind me at the bank. She smelled like a dirty ashtray. I don't want to ever smell like that, but I'm terrified of myself. I need a little boost of confidence. Thankss.

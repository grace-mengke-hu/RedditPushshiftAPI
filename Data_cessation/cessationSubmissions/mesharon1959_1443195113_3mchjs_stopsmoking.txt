Three Weeks Today!!!

Still have the fatigue, joint pains, occasional bitch attacks, and sore throat, but very few cravings. Doing well. I have NOT smoked 414 cigs, and I've saved more than $110! I smell better, have nicer breath, and will never let myself backslide. I'm very proud of myself!! Everyone should be proud to quit....it ain't easy.

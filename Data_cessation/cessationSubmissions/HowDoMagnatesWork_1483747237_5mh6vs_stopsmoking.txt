Small moral victory

The state where I live has a 'quit help line,' and I get SMS notifications every so often with progress reports, tips, advice, etc.  Today, I got a text reminding me that I can use nicotine replacement therapy.  I have not worn a patch for several weeks now.  Made me chuckle to read that.

Stay strong, people.

Quitting smoking and insomnia?

I’m only 7 days in and it’s been a bitch. I haven’t been able to sleep for the last 3 nights (I’ve been lucky to get 4 hours which isn’t enough for me), even with the aid of melatonin and Benadryl. Ahhhh, I just want a cigarette! Any advice before I break? Has anyone else experienced this?

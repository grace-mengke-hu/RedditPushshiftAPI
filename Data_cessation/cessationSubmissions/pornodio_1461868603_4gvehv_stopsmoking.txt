sleeping as an ex smoker feels like god coming down from the sky and redeeming you with caresses on your lungs

so, I had stopped for 3 months for the first time of my life after 10 years of hardcore self-poisoning. I won't digress on all the awesome effects I had in those 3 months.

Anyway, one month ago I started again as a mistake. I got 2 weeks of holiday from my new work, unexpected holiday since I was working so well and so much and I went into panic since I didn#t know what to do, and got an unexplainable craving so I smoked. I ended up smoking for one month straight.

Now I've stopped again and I'm on day 4 but it doesn't matter since for me I only get two big and long cravings (2 hours) on day one and day two, and feel lethargic on day two, and then after the two big cravings I end up a non-smoker. 

But sleeping with free lungs basically feels like the title. Sometimes you can't sleep or wake up in the night because you rest too well and the sensation of oxygen in your blood is too intense, and then think "fuck, I should be sleeping" but then actually enjoy that sensation of breathing AIR, and just lay there and relax and feel weird fine electrical shocks on your skin due to the regenerating nerve endings.

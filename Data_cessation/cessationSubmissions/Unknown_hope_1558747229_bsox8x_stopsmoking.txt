Upcoming weekend.

I got through my first weekend without drinking last weekend. I am starting to feel good but we have some of my husbands family visiting this weekend and they are drinkers. My husband hasnt been drinking with me but asked today if I was ready to drink this weekend. I told him no I committed to 30 days so just hoping I can stay strong. I'm nervous.

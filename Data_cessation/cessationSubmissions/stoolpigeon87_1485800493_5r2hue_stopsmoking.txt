I want to quit smoking and donate the savings. A reason to quit.

I have been a smoker for about 8 years. I want to quit. I've never made a real attempt at quitting. I made it about a week before at best. I never had a good reason to quit, logically i did, but nothing emotionally grounding. I am turning 30 soon and it's time to quit.

But I have an emotionally grounding reason now. I want to start donating to the ACLU, but I'm poor. If I donate even half of what I spend a month on cigarettes it will be a significant contribution (less than a pack a day is still about 250 a month in my part of the US).

I dunno how to even start. But I'm going to do it. Fuck it, it's my small part to play.

Why does my body feel quesy after smoking?

If I don't smoke, it induces restlessness and anxiety. If I do, it makes me even more restless. No cigarette high or anything, just restlessness in body and mind.

I probably smoke two-three cigarettes a day, which is not too much. It's mostly to put the uneasy feeling to rest, but doesn't happen. Does this happen with anyone else? Could it be something else? I tried nicotex, patches, vaping. The results were bleh!

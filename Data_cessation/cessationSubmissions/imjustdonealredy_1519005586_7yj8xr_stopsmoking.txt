Yeah, F off cigarettes

My dad (who smokes) had a heart attack on monday. He survived, thank god! I threw all of our smokes away that day. But you know how addicts do-I saved a few for "just in case". 

After 5 days of not smoking, I got stressed out and got my stash. Tried a half a puff and threw that fucker away. And the rest of them, too. I broke them and poured water on them. Because I want to breath and to live. I am a non smoker! WOOT!

Unhappiness without cigarettes

What do you think about this. Body is so used to stimulants that by itself it can't release hormones required to make you happy. Your body can be so f**ed up that it requires cigarettes, drugs, alcohol or what ever it is addicted to, to actually enjoy living.

For someone like this, there is two options 1. Lose your money and suffer all the breathing problems and s** what comes with cigarettes and go throught horrible slow death from lung cancer, 2. Feel healthy, save your money, but live unhappy life.

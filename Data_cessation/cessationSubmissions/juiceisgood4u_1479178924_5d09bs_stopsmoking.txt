Day 22 and no urges still.

I'd like to say I never really started,  but I had at least a couple cigs every day or so, for a decade.

I got sick late October, and my swollen throat prevented me from even just breathing normally.    A whole week of no smoking was forced on me. I'd like to think that's what did the trick.  Since then I've declined every cig offered to avoid being a social smoker.  My roommate still has some in doors, but it doesn't give me any cravings, it just reminds me of a bowling alley smell in my childhood.  

I still vape Mary j tho :)


  Edit: I run a smoke shop

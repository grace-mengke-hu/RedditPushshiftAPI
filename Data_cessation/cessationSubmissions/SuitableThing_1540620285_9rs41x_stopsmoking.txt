Question about getting rid of cigarettes/tobacco

When you quit smoking, did you throw away the left overs or give them to someone else? If so, how much was left (If you remember)?
Or did you quit after you were all out?


I'm really curious to know. I still remember a quit smoking ad years ago where a guy threw out leftovers. While i'm stuck in a cycle of telling myself 'this'll be the last packet'. 

I've been smoking since I was 15 (4 Years ago) &amp; I roll my cigarettes (Smaller than prepackaged). Each day I smoke more or less depending on how I feel (1 - 20). I also quit smoking pot almost a year ago.

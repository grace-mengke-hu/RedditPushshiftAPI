Try, try again...

I "quit" on 5/9. A stressful medical procedure 6 days in got me started again, and I've been on and off since. I lie about my smoking. To everyone. I have some deep-seated need to have a part of me that's just mine. My best friend thinks I quit over a year ago. My parents don't know I smoke. My other friends don't smoke, I don't smoke around them, they don't really know if I do or not. I don't smoke at work, never have, and my co workers have no idea. My boyfriend put me on here. I want to stop lying, I want to stop smoking, I want to be open and free. But I want to hide something, some piece of me that "if they knew, they'd actually hate me/dump me/leave". Yeah, yeah... working with the therapist on that, but haven't cracked it yet.

I learned that quitting on a Wednesday works best for me. Tomorrow is Wednesday. I finished a pack tonight, it seems to be kismet. Here we go again. The physical cravings are manageable. The anger and fury is... Manageable with my anxiety meds. The hand-to-mouth motion isn't an issue, the oral fixation isn't an issue, the "5 minutes to myself" is dealt with by going outside to my smoking spot with a 5 minute sand timer (works well, actually). 

Does anyone have thoughts on the need to lie? I'm out of ideas. And I hate failing.

Today I asked my sister if she wanted help to stop smoking. To my suprise, she said yes! Need advice.

I am 21, M, and have struggled with eating addictions all my life. So I know how hard addictions are to fight, and I still haven't beaten my own. However, I kind of know what doesn't work, such as going cold turkey.

My sister is 17. She isn't allowed to buy cigarettes legally, so she asks co-workers to buy them for her. She smokes around 12 per day.

What I have suggested is from now on, I buy them for her, to eliminate the risk of getting in trouble or whatever. From today, I will top up her pack with 10 per day for a week. The next week, only 8 per day. Each week the number will reduce it by 2.

I also had a good conversation with her saying if she ever cheated the number, by having extra cigs, that she shouldn't be shy to tell me, and I won't be mad or anything, we can tick that day off as a bad day and not let it stop us. I told her a quote I like 'Don't make a bad day a bad week. Don't make a bad week a bad month. Don't make a bad month a bad year.'

I also said if you want to stop doing this, just let me know, and we will stop. I'm trying to create a trust bond where I can know how its going without dishonesty. I know when I was helped for my eating habits I would have fast food and keep it a secret since I thought I'd be in trouble if I told.

Anyway, I'm just asking for advice. Am I doing this right? Anything I shouldn't or should be doing? I just want the best for her.

Thanks for reading, and sorry for the bad story telling, I'm not so good at writing!

EDIT: Guess I was wrong, cold turkey appears to be the best option. This is why I came here, I knew I wouldn't know the best way. Guess I have some talking to do! Thanks guys, and reddit :)

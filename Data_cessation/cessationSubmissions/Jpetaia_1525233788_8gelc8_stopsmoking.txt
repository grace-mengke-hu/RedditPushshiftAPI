My journey begins.

Tonight I will be having my last cigarette, (conveniently the last one in the pack). Ever have an event that cause you to just being in your head? Well it ya caused me to be very reflective today in a big way. Decided that there are going to be changes happening. And I’m creating a new me. A more healthier and stronger, (mentally, emotionally, and physically) version of myself. And it starts with quitting smoking cigarettes and pot, as well as drinking alcohol and eating unhealthy.

This year will mark 10 years that I have been a been smoker. Started off socially, thinking to myself “I’m not addicted, I can quit whenever,  and of course; progressed from there. I have thought tonight about why I need them! My typical smoker response? “It helps relieve my stress”. I finally realized tonight that, yeah maybe while I’m smoking it and for a few minutes after, my stress might be relieved. Guess what though, it comes back. Then what? We all know the answer to that. My solution? Just deal with the stress. Figure out why you’re stressed out and come up with a way to eliminating it permanently.  We don’t need them. They aren’t helping us, only harming.

I’ll probably post a lot in here, as way to use up my new free time. 

Anyways, thanks for giving me a little listen. Felt good to get that out and don’t have anyone to talk to, so thanks for being a supportive audience to me and each other.

Never start using nicotine if you are anxious/depressive

&gt;Im now on Hour 23 and it's hell, all my other friends who stopped before me and smoked the same amount weren't as retarded as i am right now. Im literally climbing walls and screaming while also crying.  I'm still really fucking fucking nervous right now, i need to cry, then i get sleepy, then i need to climb walls again. Never ever start smoking if you are sick in the head to begin with. Thank you and thank you and good bye and thank you for listening.

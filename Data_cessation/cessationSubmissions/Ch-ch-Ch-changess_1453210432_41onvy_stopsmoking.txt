Is smoking out of fashion? Not cool anymore?

I've recently returned going to school and I noticed that there are almost zero young smokers. Only people that I see smoking are prior service(ex-military) type students. If I do see some smoke, they are most likely be spewing off from the vapes. 

Is smoking cigarettes a thing of an old people? Do kids prefer sucking on those lightsaber thingy?

I live in southern California btw.

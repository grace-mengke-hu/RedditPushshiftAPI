Just quit as of Saturday :)

I started Champix (which I believe is called Chantix in the US) on August 21, with a quit date set for the 28. It ended up taking me until the 30th to actually completely quit, but I was slowly cutting-down between the 21->29.

I have also been using a Nicorette QuickMist spray when the cravings get too intense and I'm in danger of grabbing a smoke, but thankfully those urges seem to be very rapidly stopping :-D.

Sadly, I'm not getting much in the way of support from family/friends. My family knows I'm trying to quit and isn't un-supportive, but this really feels like a battle I'm having to fight on my own :(.

In any case, the Champix/Nicorette QuickMist seems to be doing the trick, so I really think that I will successfully quit this time! :-D

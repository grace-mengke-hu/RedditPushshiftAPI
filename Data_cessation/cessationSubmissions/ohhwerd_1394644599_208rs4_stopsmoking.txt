I finally quit smoking.

It has been a little over 24 hours since my last cigarette, and i'm feeling antsy.

I have smoked since I was 21 (33 now) about/around 10 cigs per day. Did not help that the job I had for the last 5 years (no longer work there) allowed me to smoke at my desk.

I am the only one in my household that smokes.

I am not sure what to do with myself now, I keep having urges and have been fighting them. Last night prior to bed and then trying to sleep was very hard. Woke up a few times during the night as well.

I can't chew gum as I have a plate in my mouth that gum tends to stick to and is a pain to pull off. 

Any Tips or Suggestions of things to occupy my mind? How long does it take before I stop feeling cravings?

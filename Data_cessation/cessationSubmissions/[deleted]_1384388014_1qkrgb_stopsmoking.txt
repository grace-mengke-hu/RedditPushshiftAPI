Starting my new life

That's it. Today is the day. After all these unsuccessful attempts I Finally decided to stop smoking forever... and this time I'm sure I will succeed. Not only I'm quitting smoking but today is three months that I stopped drinking so this is already a win win for me :) I'm very motivated to study hard at university, eat healthy, exercise and enjoy the life. Thank you guys for all your great stories that finally pushed me to this big step!

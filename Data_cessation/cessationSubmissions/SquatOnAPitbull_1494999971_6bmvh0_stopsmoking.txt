Keep falling off when the stress mounts...

I'm able to go for a few weeks, but some stressful times hit (new dad, looking for job, just moved into a fixer). I know what to do when the cravings come, but some days I just say "Fuck it." I'll smoke 3, and toss the pack. Then the self-hate, followed by getting back on track.

I've come a long way (was pack a day for 14 years) but this seems to be the last hump. Anyone have any stories or tricks they used for these outlier breakdowns? Hearing stories helps me tons.

Thanks for the posts and support. I'm a long time lurker, but following this sub has helped me move in the right direction! Don't give up!

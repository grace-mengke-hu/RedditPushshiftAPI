How did you guys beat it?

So I'm on day 53 (holy shit!) and I keep reading these posts about people who went a month, 2 months, 2 years and so on but eventually relapsed. This is the longest I've ever been without a cigarette. I still get cravings but they aren't strong. I'm just scared that I'll relapse. How do you know when you've won?

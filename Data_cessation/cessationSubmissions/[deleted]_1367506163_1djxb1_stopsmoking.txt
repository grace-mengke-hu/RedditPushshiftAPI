Planned to quit 6 days from now. should i just do it now?

Planned to quit on the last day of my exams (8th May). Ran out of tobacco last night, want to go get some more until then, but have half a mind to get a head start of sorts. My problem is more with willpower than physical cravings, should i leave it til planned quit or is that just my addiction influencing me?

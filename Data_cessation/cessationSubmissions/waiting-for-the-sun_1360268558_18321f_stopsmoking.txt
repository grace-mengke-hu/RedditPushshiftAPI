Getting easier, but not better. Could use some advice...

It has been just under a month since my last cigarette.  I no longer have the physical addiction for sure, and the habits really don't present themselves much, but I am still having a very hard time.  So many posts I see on here are so positive & exciting after this much time has passed; it's not how I feel.  
I **hate** being a non-smoker.  I never realized how much I looked forward to each cigarette throughout the day, and removing it from my life has taken away so much pleasure from my normal daily life.  
I still have it plenty good overall, but just have trouble looking forward to anything now.  My overall mood is dismal, and I generally feel like a basket case.  My SO is clueless - he sees the situation very black and white: gross & unhealthy -> don't do it anymore. When I try to express how it's affecting me, he'll make a joke or say something sexual. He just doesn't understand.
Everyone else seems to see major improvement after 30 days, why am I still stuck in this rut?

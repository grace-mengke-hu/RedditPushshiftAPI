Gave into it after a month...

I stutter. It was a bad day, took a lot of willpower to deal with it (for people who don't know, stutterers have good days, bad days and days like today when I'd rather be dead instead). Smoked 10 cigarettes today after being clean for a month. Feel awful about giving up my pledge :(

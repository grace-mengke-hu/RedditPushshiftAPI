5 days smoke free tomorrow!

Quitting for me, my family and my health! I beat cancer this year, and I will NOT let smoking continue to rule my life! Although my cancer was not smoking related, it very well could have been. 

I'm done! 20 years of smoking and never again! 5 days in and I feel amazing. Cravings can suck it because I am stronger than this addiction!

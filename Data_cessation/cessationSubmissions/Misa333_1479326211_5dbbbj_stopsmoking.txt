Today is day 1, I'm scared, but determined.

So, a while ago I had this terrifyingly vivid dream where I got lung cancer because of smoking. I had to go face every person who I love and who loves me and say to them " I'm sorry, but I've killed myself" and watched their reactions. The disappointment on my father's face, my mother screaming with pain, my nieces and nephews confused and crying, knowing that the life I wanted with my fiance will never be, that I've betrayed them all. 
 I've quit once before, for about 9 months, but something happened that drove me to smoke again. I know what to expect this time and that's why I'm scared! Stopping this habit hurts like hell, and the holidays are here, so there's that stress as well. 
     I don't know what I expect by making this post. I kinda feel like if I talk with people in person about this, it will draw to much attention to it all and make me panic. I feel like I just want to start living like a non-smoker, and being reminded that I'm quitting will just take away from what I'm trying to be Now. 
 Sorry for the formatting, I'm on my phone.  And thank you to anyone who reads this. Please wish me luck and send me strength.

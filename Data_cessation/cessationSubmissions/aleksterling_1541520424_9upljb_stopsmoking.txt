How do I stop smoking when it’s the highlight of my day?

I’m only 2 days into not smoking and while physically I feel fine, I can’t stop thinking about going outside and having a quiet 10 minutes to myself smoking a cigarette. Cigarettes are my favorite thing in the mornings and my time to actually socialize with others. I usually end up smoking 3/4 a pack a day.

Idk how to replace that feeling. Especially at work as well. I work alone in the back with a lot of down time so I usually smoke every 1-2 hours just by instinct or boredom. I need a mentality change.

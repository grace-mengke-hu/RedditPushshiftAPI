49 hours in.

It can't get worse than this. The cravings are almost painful. It has been consuming my life for the past 18 hours, but I haven't even considered giving in to them. We got this. Everything must come to an end, especially this heavy feeling in my chest. I'm not the first person do deal with this. It has been done, and it has been won. I can't wait to be free, I just wish I could see the light at the end of the tunnel, but I know it's there, so I will NOT give up. It obly gets better from here...

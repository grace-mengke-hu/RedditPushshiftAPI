How can I get him to stop smoking weed?

He has quit for years before so I know he can do it. I never used to mind him smoking occasionaly, but he goes through phases of smoking a little to smoking a lot and lying about it. He changes as a person and I feel like I dont know him when he smokes. I know he won't stop until he really wants to. How can I help him?

Anyone who quit smoking and tried casually smoking? Were you successful?

So I have successfully quit for about 4 months. Recently, I took a few puffs from my friend. This week I have taken to joining him on his smoke break but only taking a few puffs at a time. Once I feel the high (very easily after a few puffs), I stop. In total I smoke maybe one cigarette a day at most. I don't have any urge (yet) when I go home or on weekends. 

How dangerous is this behaviour? Has anyone tried this and it led you back to your smoking habit? Is one able to maintain a casual smoking habit? Also, does anyone know how badly an occasional smoke affect your health? Say if you smoke once a week?

My Story.

Tonight will be the last time I smoke. Period.

I've done it before, three times I've made it over 3 months.  So many benefits, better breathing, better sleep, better smell, better taste, less stress, feeling like I'm more "in the moment", not waiting down the time until I can smoke again, better productivity at work as I'm not constantly stopping mid task to leave the desk to smoke, the list goes on.

There are no benefits to smoking, that "chapter" in Allan Carr is so fucking spot on.

You get temporary relief from the withdrawal symptoms of nicotine, and then you start the cycle all over again.

About Me:

31 Years old.  20 a day smoker. I actually started smoking later than a-lot of people, around 18/19.  I started smoking cannabis, and here in the UK it's pretty standard to mix your green with tobacco, which was my first introduction to inhaling anything.  I became a pretty heavy weed smoker, and then as a result was smoking cigarettes as well.  Years later, I stopped smoking weed after a "cannabis psychosis" episode but I've remained addicted to nicotine ever since.

I have no idea why I'm doing this to my self anymore.  I'm a bit of a hypochondriac, and every time I get under the weather I start googling Lung Cancer symptoms, semi-convinced that my luck has finally ran out and it's all finally caught up with me.  Today I was under the weather a bit, turned out to being down to dehydration, but for a time I was feeling really lethargic, weak, bit blurred vision / hard to focus when I was reading, slight cough - drank 1.5l of water and I feel magic again, but in that time I was googling "early stage lung cancer symptoms" again, and worrying myself that these were the first early signs that you hear about.  Every time I eat something crunchy and it cuts the roof of my mouth, yup, I think this time it's mouth cancer, sore voice after a late night out, throat cancer, a chest infection that's taking too long to clear up, cancer, skin pustule because I'm run-down, oh this is cancer spread to the lymph nodes for sure..... you get the idea.

The thing is, sooner or later, one of these will actually be a symptom of cancer and it will be too late.  I've seen my grandparents suffer with COPD and emphysema, needing oxygen to be able to walk to the front door, I've seen clients at the bar I've worked at die from Lung Cancer.  One customer who used to struggle to order his drink because of the hole in his throat from cancer.  A guy from the local music scene who one minute was posting on facebook because he'd ran out of tobacco, the next month he was in for chemo and is dead.  

I've lived in my own place for the last three years, and it's still only part furnished because I can't find the money to buy a dining table, a rug, etc etc - I can still find enough money to spend Â£10 a day on smoking, however.  Meaning I'm never getting out of the small amount of debt I'm in.  

I've had enough.

Tomorrow, 27th January 2019, I will stop smoking.  12 years of smoking ends. I've stopped lurking, I'm on board, /r/stopsmoking \- let's do this!

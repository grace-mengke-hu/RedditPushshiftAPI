I drink to justify smoking, and I love to drink.

So about a week before Valentine's day I used an app, Smoke Free, to quit smoking. I did very well as long as I didn't drink. It was rough that first week because I had smoked for a long time and I love to drink. Also, I'm a supervisor in retail, and while I don't think it's the most important thing I could be doing it is stressful.  My wife bought me a tobacco pipe for Valentine's day because she had heard me talk about my grandpa smoking a pipe and I guess u romanticized it. Well I figured out that I could hit the pipe now and then when I was drinking and not have to worry about relapsing on the cigarettes. It went well for a year or so, but now I find myself drinking more, because i think it helps me justify getting to smoke my pipe. I honestly don't know what to do, I apparently can't cope without some kind of crutch, I don't want to smoke a pack of cigarettes a day, but I also don't want to be a drunk. I guess I'm not so much asking anyone for any help but just wanted to get the stress and guilt off my chest.

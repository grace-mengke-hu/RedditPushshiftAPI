Just decided to quit!

Hi everyone, I just found this subreddit from the smoke free app. I decided I want to quit. My bf quit about 2 weeks ago. The rest of my family that smokes have quit as well. I'm ready to do it. I went out for a smoke and I sat there and questioned why I even came outside. I was already falling asleep playing games on my phone. I could have just turned over and went to bed. 
I can't wait for that to happen. Where I don't need that last smoke. I have smoked since I was 17. I'm turning 26 next month. I have a 5 year old daughter and she asked me to quit. It's time. Now I just need all the support I can get to not wake up and walk outside. I have nicotine patches and I put one on just a bit ago. 
Thanks! :)

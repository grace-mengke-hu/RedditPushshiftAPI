Stumble at Day 4

I started my non smoking five days ago on Monday. First 2 days were fairly easy, I wore patches and was stil l slightly abuzz with my decision. This isn't the 1st time, I stopped for 2 years and 2.5 years previously. in the last 4 months I've had at least 15 mini attempts and tried to cut back a little. 
On the third day I had a bit of a squabble with my newish BF (non smoker, hugely supportive and pretty awesome dude), I felt a bit uptight and disappointed that I'd been pretty unfair toward him but still didn't need to smoke or wasn't really thinking of it. Then I get a call from my housemate that we needed to have a chat when we caught up next and that got me very worried. The worry is part of my usual anxious ways, but with it this time I saw an opportunity or excuse to have a ciggie. I thought ok, I'll drive home to resolve the issue with housemate and I'll smoke with him as well. Turns out he had other plans so I stayed at BFs place and let go of the ciggie idea, but the seed was planted. 
Next day is day 4 and I fret on and off about what the conflict is about, and deep down I can feel my resolve to let go of the ciggies dissolve. 
I could have got on this site, or spoken to a friend a that I was in a way plotting to smoke and using the anxiety around a possible conflict as some sort if excuse. 
This wasn't a sudden craving that I could have used distraction for, more me being a little shit and plotting for a ciggie. 
Now I am day one again. Ha, again it hadn't been tricky whilst wearing a patch and being busy at work. 
Any advice on dealing with the little voice in the back if your mind that slowly undermines your decision to stop smoking??

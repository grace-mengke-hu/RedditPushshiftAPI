Five hours in...

and for the first time, I am completely calm. You see, I have a secret weapon. I found a glitch in the Matrix. Nicotine withdrawal is an incredibly mild thing, Carr states this himself. The issue is the brain washing, which Carr tries so hard to remove. The secret weapon I'm using is NRT gum.

I know this flies is the face of Carr's method, but for me I think it's the only thing that's going to work. I sometimes fall into periods of depression, and become rather nihilistic. In those states, I'm rather illogical, and those are the points where I most often cave. Having this gum will help take the sting away from letting go the cigarettes. AKA the brain washing. Once the cigs are gone, I'll reap most of the benefits even while being on the gum. At that point, letting go of the gum should be easy, on account of the withdrawal being so low. I won't say I need a cigarette in my head, I'll know invariably that I'm craving raw nicotine. I can deal with that. It's battling my mind for a cigarette that kills me, all the damn tension. Anyway, rant off. I'll check back in tomorrow.

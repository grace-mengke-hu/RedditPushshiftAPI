Alternate things to do with hands and mouth

On day 5. Went OK so far. Sunrise/sunset have become the hardest times to get through. Also the nights, and the walks :(. I have been using chocolate milk with a straw for the really bad cravings. I want some alternative thing to do with my hands when I am out on a walk, so that I am not too self conscious of being on a random walk, alone, in the middle of the night; some sort of distraction. On an unrelated note, the morning cigarette was the easiest to get over and also the ones after food were easy to get over. I thought they would be the hardest. 

EDIT: typos and hopefully punctuation

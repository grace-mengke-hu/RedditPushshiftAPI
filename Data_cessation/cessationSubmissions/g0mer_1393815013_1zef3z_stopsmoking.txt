2 years today...feeling amazing! You can, too!

Quitting two years ago today led to so many other positive changes in my life.  I attribute this to finally seeing my potential for discipline and focus, as well as being able to do things I couldn't before - I would never have done the Insanity workout as a smoker, nor could I have been able to go on the wagon when I needed to.  

Hang in there all of you, you will succeed!!

First cigarette after 3 1/2 months?

Lately, I've been having cigarette cravings to the point where I dream I'm smoking. Hadn't had those since the first week I'd quit. Part of it was that feeling of wanting to know what I was missing out on. I ended up caving and bumming one of my friends' cigarettes on the 4th, just as a reminder of what I had left behind. It didn't feel good, nor bad. It helped alleviate the urge to smoke again, as I've not craved one since. I guess it kind of helped to act as a reminder of why I quit? I didn't particularly enjoy it, but again, it wasn't completely terrible. It just sort of took away that anxiety of wondering what I'm missing out on, if that makes sense? I don't want/plan to go back to smoking, but has anyone else had this experience?

9 days in, and things are getting better!

So I went through a surprising amount of withdrawal symptoms over the first few days of quitting.  I smoked unfiltered roll-ups for 26 years and quit cold turkey as the nicotine withdrawal only lasts for a week or two anyway...

I got a terribly dry and scratchy throat, a cough, concentration problems, severe insomnia for a week, constipation, irritability and emotional episodes.  Probably some other crap too but I don't want to delve too long on the negatives because.... I feel SO much better already!

Nine days is nothing.  Really.  It's a blink of an eye, cosmically, it's over before you know it.  My physical cravings have gone right down to a couple a day already, my lungs and breathing have improved a HUGE amount, I'm starting to sleep more normally again (I also gave up a long-term weed habit so my case is a bit more complicated than some), my smell and taste have improved and I'm more emotionally stable.

It's SO worth it!  I'm not being complacent as I know willpower fades over time and the urge to smoke can catch you unawares, but I'm posting this so anyone going through the early stages of withdrawal can get some encouragement.  It will get better very quickly, so hang in there, good people!  We are more than our addiction, and we can beat this!

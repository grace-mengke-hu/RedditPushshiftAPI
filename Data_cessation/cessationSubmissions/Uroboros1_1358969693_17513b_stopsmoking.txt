Thought I'd stop by here

Bought a pack last week and picked up a pack today. I've been smoking almost 2 years now and I've quit multiple times but can't seem to quit more than 2-4 months at a time.  Quitting has to be one of the toughest things I've done. just thought I'd stop by to say hello and hopefully I can browse around here with others who quit and are quitting. After I finish this pack, I hope to quit for good.

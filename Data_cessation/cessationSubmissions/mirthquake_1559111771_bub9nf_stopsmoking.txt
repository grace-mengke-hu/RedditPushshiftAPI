For months I thought about quitting. I was nervous. I thought it would be so hard. But one day I simply didn't buy a pack and never looked back. It was effortless. I've had zero cravings since.

This was 6 months ago, and I simply don't understand it. I quit about 15 years ago and it was a big challenge. After that I didn't smoke (regularly) for 2 years, but of course I relapsed. 

This time I knew I was gonna quit, especially because my lungs began to ache, but I NEVER thought that I would be able to simply put the smokes down and never think about them again. Especially because I smoked the American Spirits with the highest nicotine content ad alway tore the filter off. 

But here I am--it's been one half of a year and I have zero desire to smoke. I've never hear of anyone having an experience like this. I don't vape or chew gum. No nicotine at all. I don't miss it, I don't hink about it, and I don'r care about it. 

I am baffled. Have any of you have experiences like this? Do you know of any causes that could have made this highly improbable outcome come to fruition? I'm basically trying to wrap my mind around this super counter-intuitive outcome.

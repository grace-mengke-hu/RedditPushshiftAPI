How can I help my mother stop smoking?

My mother is 42 and I’m her first daughter at 22 years old. She had my brother when she was 27 and just last year gave birth to our sister. Through every pregnancy she quit smoking, but soon after would start up again. She would constantly quit and start up between pregnancies too but lately I’ve been really worried about her health. Times have been tough for all of us and I get that it can be stressful, but I feel like she doesn’t really care anymore. I don’t want my sister to grow up without our mother, and I don’t know how I can make her stop. She goes into our garage (to avoid getting smoke in the house) 4-5 times daily to go smoke. I just find it so upsetting because I am constantly asking her to quit and she thinks I’m just being mean to her. My brother agrees with me, but his way of going about it puts my mother in defensive mode, saying “you guys are the reason I smoke”. It’s also hard because her cousin lives with us and he has a terrible smoking habit as well. All I’m asking for is advice or even experiences any one has dealing with this type of situation.

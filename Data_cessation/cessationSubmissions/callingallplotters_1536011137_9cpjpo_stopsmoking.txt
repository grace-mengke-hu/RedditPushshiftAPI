Still going strong with no slips for the first time.

When I’ve quit in the recent past, I’d still sneak a smoke every few weeks to a month, but I think that’s because I still liked it. Now, I’ve been keeping away from it completely. Very grateful that it’s been so painless. I guess just sticking with quitting, even when I messed up, letting less and less time pass before I came back to it, is paying off. Fingers crossed still though. Shit does happen. Feeling positive.

My success story

I will tell you i feel now as if i never smoked. Physically and mentally. What ive been through can only describe as agony. There were moments i thought i was fucked for life. What helped me quit was the mindset that i was constantly moving forward even if i failed sometimes. I think time helps tremendously but you need to do your part. I choose to work out and run and swim but also trying not to set myself for failure but slowly ballancing my mind and body to a healthier place. Dont be frustrated it might take years same as any thing you work to build.

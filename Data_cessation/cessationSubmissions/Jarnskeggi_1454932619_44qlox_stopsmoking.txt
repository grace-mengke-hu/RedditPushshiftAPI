Got my star (1+ month down, rest of my life to go)

Well, this is going better than I thought. I didn't have the body aches, and I didn't unhinge my jaw like a snake like the other times I've tried. I really do think it's all in the mindset. I planned for it and wanted to do it.

I'm saving ~$20 a day. As a medieval reenactor, that means a lot more swords, clothes and camping trips. Thanks for the support I've found here, see you all next milestone!

Starting the weaning process today.

I was on the treadmill this morning coughing and just finally admitted to myself things would be a lot easier if I finally quit smoking.  The weaning method I've just made up for myself is to put 2 hours between smokes today, then 2 and a half or three hours tomorrow etc until I don't smoke at all.  For some reason I think this method might work for me.  Has anyone tried anything similar?

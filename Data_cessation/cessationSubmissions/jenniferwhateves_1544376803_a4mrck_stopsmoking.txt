1 Week Down

Today marks one week since I had a cigarette. My goal was to quit by my 30th birthday in March and I've tried quitting probably two dozen times since I started smoking about 6 years ago. I have never gotten to a week smoke free and it feels amazing! I was never "ready" to quit before and I don't even know exactly what got me into the mindset to say, "enough is enough" but I am so happy I have. 
People have told me you have to WANT to quit to be successful and damn were they right. 
My biggest challenge was my work Christmas party this past Friday; I was driving my coworker/previous lunch break smoking buddy and I had 2 beers at dinner. For me, nothing was better than a cigarette and a cold beer, and although I did have the craving to step outside with her and light up a cigarette, I pushed through the urge. 
I have been using the nicotine patches and it has definitely helped me fight the urges. I have no regrets so far and I just hope I can keep this up because it feels amazing.
Good luck to everyone!!

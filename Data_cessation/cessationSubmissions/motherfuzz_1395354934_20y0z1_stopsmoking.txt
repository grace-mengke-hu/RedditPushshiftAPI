A second hump?

Hey guys, tomorrow is 200 days for me, and I've been completely nicotine free this whole time.
I have been doing really well so far, and even went through a few months with barely any cravings, however, I have been really struggling these last couple of weeks. Today has been particularly rough. The cravings are actually distracting me from getting things done.
Has anyone else experienced a "second hump" like this?

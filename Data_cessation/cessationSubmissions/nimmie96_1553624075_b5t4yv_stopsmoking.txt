A week without cigarettes

I'm struggling but I'm doing it.  My best friend is pregnant and we decided to quit together,  I really didn't think it would be this hard but it is lol.  I can smell and breathe 10000Ã— better now and I can actually taste foods.  I've been smoking since I was like 13 or 14 so I really haven't been able to experience what the difference is as an adult until now,  I'm 23 and I want to be DONE with these cancer sticks.

I have an unpopular opinion about stoping smoking

Most people try to encourage smokers to quit by saying it gets easier with every passing day and your health will improve linearly, and this leads to new quitters getting frustrated when reality don’t meet the expectations. 

I’ve been smoke free for almost 2 years now and with me it was different. If I had to put my experience in a Time x Cravings graph, it would look like an inverted U. At the beginning it was super easy to turn down on cigarettes but the cravings just got more and more irresistible for at least half a year. Only then it began to get easier. 

Also, I did not experience a better health so fast as I hear people claiming they have. My breathing is definitely better now, I can definitely smell things I couldn’t, etc, but again it has been almost two years. I strongly believe that my health actually got WORSE a couple weeks after I quit. Of course it’s just your body reacting to the new habits. I got grumpier, coughing more than usual, lost appetite and even got some minor headaches now and then that I never had before. 

My point is that we should be more realistic about what people will go through when trying to convince them to stop smoking. Quitting tobacco is a huge improvement in your life no matter for how long you’ve smoked, but the benefits will not show up in the blink of an eye as some people claim.

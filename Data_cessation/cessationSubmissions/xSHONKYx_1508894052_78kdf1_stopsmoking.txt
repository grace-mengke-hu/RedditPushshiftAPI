Need a new healthy habit or vice

G'day guys,

I'm in the Champix (day 16) and I've been completely smoke free for 3 days. The week leading up to today I'd been smoking a whole lot less and even when I did smoke, I threw out half of it. 

My biggest issue I'm having right now is not so much the cravings (although they are sucking right now) its the habit of it. I've tried to keep snacking to a minimum, I have gum but don't want to be on that all day like a freaking camel and I have toothpicks in my mouth just to keep it busy but it doesn't seem to do the trick.

Im getting antsy because of it and need some suggestions. 

Cheers

BTW I work in the solar industry building farms so I'm outdoors for 12hrs a day 7 days a week for 4 weeks straight

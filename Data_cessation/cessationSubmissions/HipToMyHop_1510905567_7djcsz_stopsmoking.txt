Almost 200 days

Holy shit, I posted here a long time ago and now its been almost 200 days since I've touched a cigarette. thats kinda a lie, I did touch one quite a few but never smoked a cigarette all this time :D 
I was just 15 when I quit and in around 2-3 months I'm turning 16. I'm glad that I quit. My breathing became a lot better, stamina regained (still not the best) and I was actually able to participate in athletics season this year, I won in high jump! Admittedly I've been vaping weed but free of the nicotine for 194 days! Woohoo!

To anyone who's around my age, quit while you can, because I've seen people who've ruined themselves because of cigs. It might not be as harmful as heroin or shit in the short term but the addiction is worse. My ma would rather buy a pack of cigarettes than keep us fed, not having your fix really changes people. Stop before you turn into that

Also, thanks to this subreddit for existing. I wouldn't have quit if I hadn't seen this.

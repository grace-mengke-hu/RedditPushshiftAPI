I want to buy a pack.

Me 'quitting' is not going how I ever planned. I did chantix last year and I loved it, until I couldn't afford it anymore. 

I couldn't afford cigarettes last month so I got patches for free through my health insurance. I've always thought patches were stupid, and I still think so. 

I haven't bought cigarettes for myself since September 12. I've bought them for 2 other people. It wasn't as hard as I thought. But I still want to every day. I bum from my sister and boyfriend a lot and unfortunately they smoke gross cigarettes. 'A lot' being 3-4 cigs a week as opposed to my 70+ a week. 

I'm about to break. I'm sitting at home being sad and all I want is to go the 2 blocks to the Valero and get some Marlboro Methols. That's all I want right now.

40 days in, the only hard thing is the feeling in my throat?

I feel completely OK, cravings are very rare and low-key. But more then a month later my throat still feels weird, in a moist, disgustingly healthy kind of way. It's quite distracting. It only feels "normal" if I drink a lot the day before.

Does anyone else have experience with this?

20 years at 1 pack/ day. eCigs holding me off. Looking forward to day three.

I've been a smoker since 12 and a pack a day since 14. At 34 I've only been without cigarettes for two times in my life due to illnesses. I'm closing on day two now and using eCigs to ween me off. I can't tell you how excited I am. I hope to report back at the 7 day mark with good news. Let's do this!

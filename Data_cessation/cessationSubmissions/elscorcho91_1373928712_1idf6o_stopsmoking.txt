I haven't smoked in a week after smoking consistently for 4 years. It feels awesome.


my doctor put me on Wellbutrin as an antidepressant and I was pretty stoked to find out that it had smoking cessation as a use. So I decided to use that to my advantage and stop smoking completely, since I found that I didn't feel like smoking nearly as much after taking it. I haven't smoked a cigarette in a solid week now, which is good since I've smoked literally almost every day for 4 years. 

I don't crave the nicotine per se, and I don't feel like my mood has changed because of it (probably because of the medicine), but I do find myself kind of wanting one in the same way that I might want candy or something. Also, last night, I went out barhopping and it was pretty hard not to smoke, but I managed to keep a toothpick in my mouth and rolled it around kinda like a cigarette, which actually kind of helped.

It's just frustrating because many of my friends smoke and I typically smoked the most after a big meal or when drinking, so I am trying to break myself of the habit of enjoying that part of those experiences.

Any other tips as to how to deter my oral fixation?

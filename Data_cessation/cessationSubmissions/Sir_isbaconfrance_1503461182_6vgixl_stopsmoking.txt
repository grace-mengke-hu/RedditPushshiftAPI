Anyone try Rape'?

If you don't know what it is.  It is made from ashes of sacred plants as well as tobacco.  It contains some niccotine and you blow it up your nose.

I found after having Rape' gave me a real benefit from the tobacco.  Cigarettes do not have a benefit no matter what you tell yourself.  They do not DO the things you keep saying they do, they only hurt you.  Because the plant was supposed to be used as the indigenous do, LOW frequency HIGH dose.  Cigarettes high frequency low dose do nothing more than raise your tolerance and make you sick.

I think Rape' helps get your mind to go where the plant was supposed to get you to go when it was mental medicine and not a habitual thing or social identifier.

I'm 8 months (badge is off) cigarette free but every few days I have some rape' and it gives me everything I need.

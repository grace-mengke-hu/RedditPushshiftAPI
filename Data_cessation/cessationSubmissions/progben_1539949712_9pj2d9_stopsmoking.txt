The Linearity of Not Smoking &amp; Losing Weight; Experience vs Reality

Hey all,

I've made it over 8 months now (in part thanks to the enormous help of this sub) and I just wanted to share my experience of my achievements in 2018. Getting cigarettes out of my life and losing weight at the same time wasn't exactly easy, but the two things did go hand in hand. Further to this, I started to notice how the unpredictable patterns in weight loss which so often put people off their goals and give a false sense of failure are mirrored when giving up smoking.

Here we go (and sorry it's a lengthy read - I hope it helps someone out there)

**Losing Weight: My Experience**

When losing weight, it's incredibly easy to lose heart because one day, you step on the scale and your weight has gone up. It's one of the worst feelings in the world, especially when you've put in so much work. I had times when I'd weigh myself on a Monday and see a +7lb gain on the scale, even though I knew for a fact\* I should have lost weight that week.  So my course of action was to weigh myself every single day, twice a day and track the various ups and downs of the body. The results were fascinating. I was much heavier in the evenings, and much, much heavier in the mornings after having eaten salty food the night before. Exercise in the evening would cause me to gain weight immediately afterwards and sometimes water weight would take three full days to leave my system.

**Our experience of something - how it manifests itself to us - differs from the reality**

With this in mind, it's clear that our bodies don't interact the way we want them to, when we want them to. Even though my weight came off, it didn't feel like it came off in a linear way. When analysed on a day-to-day level, this proved to be true. And we do live day-to-day, after all.

**Not Smoking: My Experience**

Giving up cigarettes was, for me at least, a very similar experience. I gave up for 6 months cold turkey last year but then the cravings came back, stronger than before. I caved in and smoked - the same way if, after a 6 month diet, I suddenly ended up heavier than when I started. My brain took this confusing information and started attacking my process, rather than rationalising why it was happening. I was back to my 20 a day in no time at all and felt like I had been beaten by some impossible task.

This time, I really paid attention to the cravings - when they happened, why they happened. Day 7 was harder than Day 2. The fifth week had harder moments than the first. After 4 months, things reached their most difficult of the entire quit. The reasons for these spikes aren't exactly clear but what I can say is that even though things did get easier **on average** week by week, my experience of that average - through spikes of depression, anxiety, insomnia and cravings - certainly didn't feel easier. 

&amp;#x200B;

**My experience of pain was not linear, just as my experience of weight loss was not linear.** 

&amp;#x200B;

To summarise then, and here's the paradox - for me, things did get easier, on average, week by week. Things **did** **not** get easier day by day. For example, Day 49 may have been the hardest day of the entire process. Day 2 may have been the easiest. 

&amp;#x200B;

**The solution?** 

Stop thinking about giving up smoking as a linear process. Expect difficult days and be ready to power through them as and when they come. See the cravings as a challenge and take pleasure in getting through them where you can.

I probably won't be posting here very frequently nowadays but I'll be checking back in occasionally to share my thoughts and help out. Thanks so much to everyone for their support - this subreddit really is a brilliant resource that we're all extremely lucky to have.

Feel free to message me if you want to ask any questions or if you just want someone to rant at during a craving

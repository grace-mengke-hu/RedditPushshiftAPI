I can do this

I have to keep telling myself that I can do this. Over and over and over. I think about smoking more now than I did at the beginning. I almost broke today. I was training someone at work and I could smell the faint hints of stale smoke the entire time. I'm moving Friday and getting married in less than 2 months. The stress is killing me. But I know smoking won't help at all. I've come so far! I can do this. I can do this and I'll be better for it.

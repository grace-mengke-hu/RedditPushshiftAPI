I'm so stoked this subreddit exists! THANK YOU!!!

First off a BIG THANK *YOU* to the people who created this space and to all the people supporting each other.  Also I am sending out a big THANK *YOU* to everyone just starting out--thanks for being excellent to yourself.

A friend of mine quit a little over a year ago and he told me he used this subreddit and the phone app to help with the process.  I smoke about a pack a day.  I've been on Wellbutrin for about 1 month now--set my quit date about a week ago.  I am happy to say I have almost completed my first day of not a single cig.

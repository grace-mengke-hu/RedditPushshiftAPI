Need help!

Hey guys, I really need your help. I quit cold turkey about a week ago. Struggeling really a lot the last days having heavy withdrawal symptoms. I will never ever smoke again, because I don‘t want to hurt my lungs anymore. But my body feels so stressed cause of the missing nicotine, that I‘m constantly nervous, my muscles freak out and I nearly can get sleep at night. I know that these are stress signs but I doesn‘t help telling me that. My question is now, do you guys think I can try it with NRTs although I quit 7 days ago? Or is it too late because all nicotine is already out of my body?

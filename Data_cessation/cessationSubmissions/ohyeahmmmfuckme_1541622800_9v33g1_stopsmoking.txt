My friend left his phone in my car. What should I do?

A friend asked me to drive him an hour away. I dropped him off there and went back home. When I got home I relapsed his phone was on the seat. He has a pof account and I messaged him on there but I don't know if he will see it or not because obviously. He has two roommates but I never met them. I really don't know what to do. I get done with work at 10pm and I don't know if I should try to drop it off or not? I'm really shy and timid and get scared talking to people. I thought about leaving it in a bag by the door but it's raining and someone might steal it? Idk help

wow i didn't realise it's been that long. +6months

I just saw a link on my frontpage to /r/stopsmoking and i thought i'd pop over and see how my badge was looking. I was amazed it doesn't feel that long, and i feel great. The money i'm saving is now repayments on a new car and motorcycle (much better way to pass the time). Anyways hang in there guys It really is the bes thing you can do.

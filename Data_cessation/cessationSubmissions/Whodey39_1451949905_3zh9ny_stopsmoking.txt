Just got done having my last one.

Me and my buddy have talked about quitting for years. We started together when we were 14 and thought we were bad asses, I wish we never did. I didn't believe the bad things about smoking and thought I was invincible but my my wake up moment came in November when we went hunting and decided to not sit in a blind like we always did and go deep into the woods. We took separate paths and I went up a hill and had to stop every 10 feet to just breathe and by the time I reached the top I was wheezing loud and breathing like I was being choked. He said he had about the same result and we're only 21.  

I have a girl friend who has begged me to run a 5k with her but I kept telling her no because I know I couldn't make it especially if a walk in the woods about killed me. But after finding this subreddit and reading some success stories I'm done with the excuses. Called my buddy to tell him I'm quitting and begged him to quit with me and he agreed. So me and him just had our last cigarettes together and I'm never gonna look back. I wanna quit while Im still young and run that 5k. Wish me luck and good luck to you all.

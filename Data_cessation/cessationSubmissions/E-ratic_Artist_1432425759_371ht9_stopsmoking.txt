Looking for options.

So I've quit smoking now since February, cold turkey.  I knew I couldn't keep doing what I've been doing to myself, I'm way too young to face the real long term effects of smoking. But I just can't shake the want to smoke, just to hold the cigarette between my fingers amd inhale the beautiful taste that is nicotine. My question is, is there any thing I can use as replacement? With my work I'm unable to smoke weed and I don't trust e-cigs, is there anything else that's herbal perhaps that's close to smoking a cigarette? 

Thanks for your help.

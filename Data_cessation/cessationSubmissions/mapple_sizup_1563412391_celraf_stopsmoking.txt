About a month and a half in! Haven’t really get an improvement in my health. The cravings can last a whole day (like today). Need help/your personal experience.

Even when I was a smoker, I was always pretty athletic. I climbed, ran, and did other things all while smoking. I quit a month ago after 16 years.

Does this ever get easier? 

It’s been a month. I’ve had a headache all day. I feel out of it. I’m tired. I still wake up in the middle of the night and have trouble falling back asleep. Don’t get me wrong! Some days are easier and I feel much sharper; but today is fucking balls. Is this normal?

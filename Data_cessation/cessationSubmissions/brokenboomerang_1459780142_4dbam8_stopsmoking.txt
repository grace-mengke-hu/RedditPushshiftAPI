Nicorette inhaler

I was at the pharmacy dropping off a scrip to be filled for my little boy and when it came to "Ok and is there anything else I can do to help you today" bit, I sheepishly pointed to the provincial smoking cessation program flyer.


I went with the inhaler and am starting today. I've tried quitting cold turkey plenty of times but this is the first time I got over myself long enough to ask a pharmacist for some help.

Ok well wish me luck! Sorry I'm rambly as I'm in transit and even with the quitting aid, the thought of not smoking is really urging on a panic attack. :/

Off topic (but not really) does anyone feel super unfocused when trying to quit? My brain is all over the train.

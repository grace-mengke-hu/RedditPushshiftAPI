Blood pressure of 146/97

I saw my psychiatrist today, and my blood pressure was 146/97. I made an appointment with my PCP, but I know I need to quit smoking. I need to set a quit date and DO IT. I’m in danger of dying. Ugh. Now with this added stress, I want to smoke MORE. 

Thoughts and prayers folks, please.

ETA: no I’m not 265 days quit. I don’t know how to remove that.

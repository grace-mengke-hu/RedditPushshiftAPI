Smoking up North is rampant

Majority of people up north in Nunavut are Inuit and I am happy to be one of them. 

Growing up here, you'd find it smoking is a societal norm, you can't go anywhere without finding someone you know that smokes or at least someone you know does. I have been smoking for a year to experience how difficult would it be to quit smoking, unfortunately I got hooked fast. Because of the fact that most of your family and friends smoke makes it highly difficult to kick the habit and most of the people in the North would agree.

It is heartbreaking that you can't go a day without hearing a loved one dying of sickness that could have been preventable. I lost my father from lung cancer and he was a chronic smoker.

Coming from a small town, what are your advices to finally have the motivation to quit smoking?

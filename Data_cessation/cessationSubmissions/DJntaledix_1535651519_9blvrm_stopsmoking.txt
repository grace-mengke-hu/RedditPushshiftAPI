Is shortness of breath when quitting normal?

I’m one of those that’s “tried” to quit a million times. I’ve smoked off and on for almost seven years, and have been a pack a day for a year and a half.  I had one last blowout on Sunday, and over the past four days, I’ve cut back dramatically to an average of five cigarettes a day. However the past two days, I’ve been struggling with shortness of breath. When I smoke, I feel like there’s no shortness. I’ve never experienced this before and I’m just curious if anyone else has. I just moved cross country, so I don’t know if different weather/air has anything to do with it. But with that in mind, I plan on going to a doctor once I figure out who to see in my area. Anyway, any advice or thoughts would be awesome.

Just joined. Started the patch yesterday after 12 plus years of smoking.

I have tried to quit many times before but never with any aids. And I have never made it past the second day. This morning I had a huge breakdown and more than considered buying some cigarettes. Luckily my wife reminded me why I was quitting in the first place. 

I also wanted to let everyone know that your stories have really inspired me to continue my journey and quit this habit.

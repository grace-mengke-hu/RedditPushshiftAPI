The "amazing" cigarette.

I've been smoke free for almost 22 hours. It's pretty great so far! I've smoked since I was 15, so 8 years.. 
Breathing is already easier and more steady, I feel good and calm. It hasn't been hard at all. I'm thinking that it's hard to stop because you make it to a big thing in your head so I've told my self that this isn't a major thing to do, so for me it's easier to handle. Didn't tell anyone either. I've tried stopping million times before, always failed badly. 

But, I'm at parents house so I'm bored as fuck, it's dark and could outside and everyone is just watching the computer screens.. It's harder to stop when you're bored I think.

So, I don't feel like smoking, but my mind has this image of this "just one" that will feel "amazing". So calm, boredom relieving, cozy and good with this one cup coffee. It's so tempting, and it's only day one! Somebody tell me what a shitty that "just one" is gonna be.. 

And another question, how did you feel day 3? I've heard it the worst one.

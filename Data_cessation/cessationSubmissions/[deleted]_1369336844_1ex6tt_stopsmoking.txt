Day 9 and good news

So I'm on my 9th day of not smoking after a 10 year habit. The first awesome thing that happened to me today was I didn't even remember that I stopped smoking until I was awake for about an hour. It was kind of like "Oh yeah I stopped smoking, cool!"

The second thing is I am now officially disgusted by cigarettes. Drunk and late at night I've stuffed a few butts down into the mulch outside my front door. Well today was raining heavily which forced all the butts back to the top of the mulch. I bent down and collected them and took them inside. As I was putting them in the trash can I caught a huge wiff of the cigs and started gagging immediately. I am definitely NOT going back to smoking, fuck that. Its actually hard to fathom how I enjoyed the things for so long in the first place...

TLDR - Forgot I even quit, cigs are gross, good luck /r/stopsmoking !

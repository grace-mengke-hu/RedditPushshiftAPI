60 hours in and mental gymnastics kicking in hard.

Past 48 hours ive been out of town on a snow trip. Decided beforehand I was going to take these couple days to quit smoking since there are no stores that sell cigarettes. The first two days were surprisingly easy. No access so really no cravings.

Now im back in town and my mind is fucking with me so hard since I can pick up a pack anytime now. I feel like this is my real first day. Ive had cigarettes on my mind for the past hour but luckily i havent caved to buy a pack.

 The one thing keeping me sane is remembering all the times i lit a cigarette on the way to the train or bus as something to just fill the void and eventually tossing it after a few puffs because it wasnt really doing much for me except burning my lungs up. All those moments remind me that it really is just an addiction and not something I really get enjoyment out of.

Then again i miss the nicotine high.

Fuck cigarettes lol.

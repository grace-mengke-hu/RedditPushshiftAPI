24 hours since I stopped smoking!

Yesterday I was having a coffe and light up a smoke.

And as i was hald way through my cigarette, I felt this burning feeling in my throat like never before.

Then i started coughing really bad. And while I was coughing all sorts of shit came out and the smell was horrible.

At that moment I decided to quit. I had just opened my pack of smokes and throwed it away.

Its been very tough this first 24 hours buf fingers crossed hopefully i will make it through.

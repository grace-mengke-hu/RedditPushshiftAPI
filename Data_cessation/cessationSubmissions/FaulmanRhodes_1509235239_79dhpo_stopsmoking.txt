Traveling with smoker colleagues

and the hardest part is saying no to a smoke when it's just . . . there. New badge for me.

The first day after the reset was easy.

I nearly bummed one the second day. I was literally standing there next to my buddy, as if frozen, watching him puff. But the moment passed.

Today was easy again. It helps to remind myself that 7 years ago, I could easily swim 50 yards underwater on a single breath, and that now, I get winded walking up more than 2 flights of stairs. Now, there's always phlegm in the back of my throat.

Keep at it, y'all. I will too.

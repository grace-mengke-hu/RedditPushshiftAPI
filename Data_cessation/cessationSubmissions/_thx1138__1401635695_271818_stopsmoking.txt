18 hours

This is huge for me. I feel I have gone this long I can't screw it up now. I've been awake for a few hours and havent even had the urge to vape yet. True test is the NHL playoff game 7 tonight, which drinking will be involved. I'm excited for the game and equally excited that if I can get through day and evening without slipping I'll be well on my way.

Even if I falter, the fact I've made it this long so far is monumental.

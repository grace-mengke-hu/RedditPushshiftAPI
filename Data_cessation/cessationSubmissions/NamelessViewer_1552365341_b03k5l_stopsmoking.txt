Looking for advice

I am a college student and am in an extremely stressful major. I started using nicotine whenever I would hang out with friends, and it progressed to a method to cope with the stresses of school. Now I’ve been using it every day for almost a year and I have no clue how to stop. I have tried before and always feel like an anxious wreck. Any advice is helpful, I’m not sure when or how to start quitting :(

When do sleep patterns return to normal?

As my badge says, at 134 days right now and feeling pretty good and confident.  However, my sleep patterns have yet to return to normal.  When I was smoking, and even before, I was a heavy sleeper and would sleep very soundly through the night, always waking to my alarm clock.  I could sleep in to noon on the weekends.  Although the insomnia has greatly improved from the first few weeks after quitting I still wake up almost every night between 3 and 5 am and can't get back to sleep.  Even if I go to bed late, even after midnight, I'm awake around 4.

Has anyone else experienced this?  Will my sleep pattern return to normal?  Should I talk to a doctor or take some pills?  (I'd really rather not take pills though)  I find it odd that I slept far better with a stimulant coursing through my veins.  Any advice or information would be appreciated.  Thanks for your time.


EDIT - I have started exercising more now that I've quit.  I work out 3-5 times a week, do 30 minutes of cardio then 30 minutes of lifting, plus stretching, etc.  So I doubt it's that.  I'll pick up some melatonin and give that a shot.  I've tried drinking alcohol and it helps me get to sleep but not stay asleep.  Sounds like this isn't normal either, I'll bring this up with my doctor next visit.

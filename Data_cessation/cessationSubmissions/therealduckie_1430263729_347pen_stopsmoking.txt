I am in a hospital bed, about to have a quadruple bypass because of smoking. Stop NOW before you are me.

I am not looking for pity. I am here as a wakeup call.

Tomorrow my chest will be ripped open, heart stopped and I will lose 20-25% of my heart capacity because I never quit after my first health issues. 

Don't be me. This sucks.

Hopefully I can reply in a week after recovery...if I am lucky.

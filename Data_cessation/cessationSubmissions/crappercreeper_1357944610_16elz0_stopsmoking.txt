Its been on week, and I have managed to not kill anyone.

I did not intend on quitting, but I have been thinking about it for a while.  I had a little bit of a cold the week before last and I just did not pick them back up. In the past week my sense of smell has come back. I work at a community college, it seems that everyone there smokes, and I find that I can smell someone smoking from 20 yards away some days. I have tried to quit a few times before, but now I find the smell of burning cigarettes revolting. I think that that is a good sign.

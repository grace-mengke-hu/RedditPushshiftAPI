Well damn.

Before New Year's Eve, I went a week without a cigarette. My cravings were manageable, even when I was drinking or hanging out with smokers.

On New Year's Eve, however, this week of good behavior ended. I had one cigarette, and so far that's the only one.

Resetting my badge was far more shameful than I anticipated. But, on the bright side, I've learned a valuable lesson about nicotine addiction.

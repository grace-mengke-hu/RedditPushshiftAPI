17 year old, started smoking 2 months ago. Need your advice, discourage me.

Aright. I'm at a full time boarding school, the people I hang out with are all smokers. I started smoking 2 months ago and I'm now smoking 1 or 2 cigarettes a day.

I keep telling myself that 1 or 2 ain't too bad. Stopping seems impossible, I hang out with my buds and I just really feel like lighting one. 

Soon I'll be smoking 5 or more. How do I avoid temptation. I can't just stop hanging out with them, I have a great time with them. Their my buds. 

God damn. What is your advice? anything that could help me in anyway.

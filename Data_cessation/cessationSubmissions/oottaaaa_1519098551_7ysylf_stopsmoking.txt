Rough patch, posting for accountability.

I've been doing well for the last week or so. However, I find myself with the house to myself for the whole week. Having some kind of accountability structure (with my SO home) has been helpful to me, and I'm nervous about not having that.

I decided this morning that I was going to smoke today and I'd recommit later. At first I was going to do it first thing in the morning. Then I decided to do it after work. Then I decided to go to the gym first. Then I decided on after dinner. Then I decided to stay home and not buy cigarettes.

So I made it through today, but the cravings were relentless! Any advice on getting through the rest of the week? I'm trying to be **aggressively healthy** this week -- going to the gym daily, eating really well, etc. -- I think this helps a little bit as smoking feels so much more damaging when I'm working so hard on everything else.

On an unrelated note...I quit drinking a little over four months ago, and find that I have very little desire to use this time to myself to drink, so that's something. I want to get to that point with smoking as well!

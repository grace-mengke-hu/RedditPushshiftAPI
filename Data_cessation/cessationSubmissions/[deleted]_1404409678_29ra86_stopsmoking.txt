Fought off the craving!

So yesterday...nothing was different, everything was the same, but for whatever reason I was experiencing a lot more anxiety than usual. From the minute I left work to the minute I went to bed, my brain was telling me it would be fine to just go to the store and get a pack of cigarettes. That I deserved it because I was experiencing so much stress. (My life is actually quite stressful, at this time, which is one of the major reasons I QUIT smoking.) 

I fought it off! Every time I had the thought that it would be fine, I thought about how I would feel after I smoked. I thought about the wasted money and the increased anxiety over thoughts about health. Day 32!

I thought I was gonna cave

Im 6 weeks in for smoke free, but for some reason I’ve been craving a ciggie. 

There was a moment of testing my commitment last night.
When I got home from work, there was a packet of ciggies sitting on my post. I reckon someone left it accidentally.
I immediately stole one from the pack without thinking anything, and then went back to my room.

I seriously thought I was gonna smoke.
But instead, I went to bed.

This morning, I was so relieved that I didn’t smoke, and flushed in the toilet.

Phew, that was a close call for sure.

Smoke-Free Savings

Based on how much I paid per pack and the average I smoked, I spent $3.57 every day on cigarettes. Now I have a glass jar where I put that exact amount every day, to the penny. It helps me to see my progress. I don't take any money out of the jar, and I don't plan to. If I had spent the cash on smokes it would be gone forever anyway. I wanted to share the idea, which I got from an app I've been using, in case it is useful to anyone else.

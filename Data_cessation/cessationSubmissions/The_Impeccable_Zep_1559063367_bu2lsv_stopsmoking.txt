Thoughts on using a Juul to stop smoking?

Don’t know if this is the correct subreddit, since I see a lot of people quitting cold turkey here, but I just recently bought a Juul vape to help me quit. I don’t have an urge to hold a cigarette and I don’t have the urge to chain smoke anymore.

I know a Juul still has nicotine and is also addictive, but I thought it would be a step in the right direction. I can feel my lungs getting better for sure. However, I’m worried I’ll still be addicted. At least I can manage my intake more closely now. Any thoughts?

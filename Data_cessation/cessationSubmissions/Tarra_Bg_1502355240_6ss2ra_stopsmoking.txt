Anyone wants to join me? :warning: bad english ahaed :))

Hi fellow warriors, I am not a native english speaker and that's why I hesitated earlier to post.

I plan to quit on Sunday, the 13th, three days from now. 

My previous attempts failed miserably of course. 
Now I am changing my perspective:
Rather than blame, shame, guilt, etc I now see quitting as an ultimate act of love for my body. 

Rather then being AFRAID of failure, bad withdrawls etc, my mindset is changed: I am gonna experiment with mindfulness- full on. So, when cessation starts, bad withdrawl or huge urge to smoke, instead of granbing a cig to AVOID my feelings, I am going to be fully present with pain until it dissapates. 

I know that from experience, that when I accept something, it passes. When I am using "strong will" then my mind fixates on the very thing I am trying to avoid. 

Little background: smoker for 20 years. 

If anyone care to join me, it will be fun.

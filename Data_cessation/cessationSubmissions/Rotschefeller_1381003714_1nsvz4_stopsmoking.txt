...I just really enjoy tobacco...

By the title, I mean that I do not believe myself to be physically addicted to nicotine. Here's my brief history.

I smoked for a few years in high school and my first two years of college. My wife (then fiance) and I decided to quit about 4 years ago. After about a year of absolute success we relapsed, but still only smoked about one cig per day. A year and a half ago my (by this time, wife) found out she was pregnant so she stopped cold turkey, while I cut down further but didn't stop completely.

Now, here I am. However moderately, I smoke. I will bum one from friends a few times per week and on occasions buy a pack. There are no physical forms of withdrawal, very seldomly cravings when I am not being social. I just enjoy smoking, but realize that I need to stop.

The thing is, I am usually pretty good in the willpower department. But this might be the first thing I enjoy that I have ever had to give up totally rather than moderately.

This is something that I am going to have to do myself, so this is as much of a rant as anything else. But if anyone has any tips or comments I will be happy to read them.

Thanks for reading.

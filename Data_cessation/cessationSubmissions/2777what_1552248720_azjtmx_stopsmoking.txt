Just passed 48 hours!

Howdy y'all,

&amp;#x200B;

Just passed 48 hours nicotine free. Pretty psyched about it, and feeling surprisingly okay this time around. Getting a little irritable, but nothing overwhelming yet. In 24 hours I should be totally free of nicotine if my research is right, which would be the first time in a few years that was the case. Exciting times!

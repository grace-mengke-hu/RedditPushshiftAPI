Symptomatic low blood pressure?

Before I get into the content of this post, I just want to clarify that I am not looking for medical diagnoses. I am just curious if anyone else has been through something similar. Also, I searched the forums before posting, but most of the posts were related to high blood pressure, not low. 

I am a 24 year old that quit smoking 25 days ago. I smoked for 8 years and I am incredibly glad that I finally made the decision to kick this nasty habit.

In the past week or so, my blood pressure has dropped dramatically. When I was smoking, my blood pressure regularly ran 160/100. I should also point out that I work in a high-stress field, so smoking was not the only contributing factor to my high blood pressure.

Now it runs anywhere from 80/40 to 90/50. I AM FEELING IT. I am weak, tired, dizzy, and unable to concentrate. It is awful. I have to be able to concentrate for my job, and it is impacting my day-to-day.

My question is, has anyone gone through this when they quit? How long did it take to go away? Did you have to enlist the help of a doctor?

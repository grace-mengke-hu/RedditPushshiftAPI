Checked my badge today. Turns out I'm 56 days in!

I have to be honest. 56 days ago was the day I decided I was not going to be a slave to my impulse to smoke, not the last day I smoked a cigarette. I've smoked on maybe 3 occasions since, only in social settings with a hard limit of 2 cigarettes.

That may not be very kosher, but... since I took the decision to stop, I haven't smoked out of compulsion. I had the fear the first time that I might smoke one night, and wake up the next day and crave another smoke - which had happened a number of times in my past attempts to quit. But, this time it did not. For whatever reason, the mental boundary I set for myself worked.

So, here's my little tip. When I went out drinking with my smoker friends, or any other social event, I resisted taking a puff until the very end when the glasses were empty and everyone was ready to leave. When that time came, I'd smoke just one, only if I wanted to, and I'd always bum it from a friend so I wouldn't have any smokes to take home. 

This might help you social smokers out there. I know the struggle, believe me.

11 months

I just hit 11 months smoke free this morning! I quite about ten years ago for two years then while in college I picked up the habit again . My story is I am a 29 year old male. I smoked a pack and a half of Marlboro reds for almost 12 years. Last February I was life flighted from a car accident that should have killed me . I finally decided when I recovered in August I would quite. So I quite on August 28 th along with alcohol ! I will never go back to smoking as the gym and my diet are my new addiction. I am entering a figure competition show in the fall so have been training very hard. But in 11 months I have not smoked 10048 cigs and so far saved 3342. I'm so proud one more month and I'm back to a year status! Thank you all so much ;)

Umpteenth attempt

So I’m on my umpteenth quit attempt. I’ve been on and off the smokes for at least 10 years. Over those years I’d say I’ve been off more than on. But my longest time off them is 6 months. This year I managed 5 months from January 1st. Slipped and was back on them for a short time. I’m on 14 days now.

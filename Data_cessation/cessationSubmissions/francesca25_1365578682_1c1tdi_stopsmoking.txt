What plays the biggest part in the addiction, the mind or the body?

Just out of curiostity, say I (a smoker for 2 years, an addict who plans to quit but who has a very weak will) and  a person who never smoked changed bodies. Who will smoke first? I mean, will it be me, because I think of cigarettes too much, and it`s beyond the dull need of the body for nicotine, or will it be the other person, because the body will ask him for nicotine?
What I`m trying to ask is, how much role into the addiction does the body play, and how much does the mind?
I do hope I made myself understood, since coherence is not my main talent. 
TL;DR: what really makes me unable to quit: my mind always focusing on smoking, or the nicotine in my body? Will it really  be much easier after 3 days of quitting, after the nicotine has left my body?

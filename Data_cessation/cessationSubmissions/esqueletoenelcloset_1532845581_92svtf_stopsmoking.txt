Two months ideas

Today i made two months as a non-smoker. I´ve never been this far and I feel proud and eager to continue in this journey. BUUUUUUT: to be honest, I don´t feel any fisical change. Everything, from my breathing to my energy is pretty the same as two months ago (I was smoking 5-8 cigarettes per day, but there were times when I smoked 20 daily and I smoked for 10 years). It's weird, because everyone talks about how everything tastes better and how great do they feel.   


In th other hand, the same thing (that I don't feel any different when I am a smoker and when I am a non-smoker) may be a powerful reason for not smoking again: Now it feels pretty much the same but, in one of those options I'm not hurting my body or putting my future health in risk.

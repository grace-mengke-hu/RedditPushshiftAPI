Hypnotherapy worked for me (sort of)! Want to spread the word.

I know I'm jumping the gun a little because it's only been three days, but these three days have been **by far** the easiest first three days I've ever had. It feels way different this time. I'm a true skeptic at heart, but was hoping that I could remain open-minded enough for the hypnotizing to "work." Sadly, I wasn't able to buy into it; I found it silly and tedious (I was in her office for four hours!), and never felt myself go into a "trance." HOWEVER, before the session, we talked about my smoking for about an hour: why I smoked, why I was choosing to quit, what it did and didn't do for me, how it affected my loved ones, and most importantly, what my life was going to be like without cigarettes. I got so much closure. We worked through all my fears, hopes, worries, etc. It was like the most healthy breakup imaginable. I made peace with letting go of cigarettes. I said my goodbyes. The hypnotherapy wasn't magical or anything, it just drilled everything we talked about in that first hour into my head.

I've been having very mild and manageable withdrawal symptoms that I expect will dissipate soon. Despite them, I feel fantastic. Like a huge weight has come off my shoulders. I decided to supplement my quitting with hypnotherapy on a lark, but I'm so glad I did. Even though it didn't "work," it somehow seemed to turn me into a non-smoker in a matter of hours! I really can't recommend it enough. I'm sure this is coming off as naive to the more seasoned quitters out there, but I don't care. For the first time since I started smoking, I can clearly envision my future without a single cigarette. I wish someone had told me about it sooner!

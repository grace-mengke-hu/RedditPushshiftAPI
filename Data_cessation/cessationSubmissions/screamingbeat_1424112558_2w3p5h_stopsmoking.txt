19 days no fallbacks!

I decided to quit! I was a hypocrate I knew it is shit for you, told that to people tried to say I'm not a smoker etc. At the end of the day I'm the onlyone in the room. And I was a smoker somedays (nights out) it was more than a pack somedaS nothing. But usually 5-6. So I quit exactly 19days ago. 
I told myself that this is it, I'm only gonna quit once but it is gonna be forever! Never gonna smoke again, not a puff. I knew this is the only way and the way I want it to be.
First mistake: forget about your last fag! If you think about it as a breakup with the love of your life there is a pretty good chance of falling back. Once youre ready youre done with the discusting bastards. They smell bad, they hurt you, you don't need them! I know youre only doing out of boredom!! you have to convince yourself to pity smokers and feel normal not smoking, more than that: PROUD!

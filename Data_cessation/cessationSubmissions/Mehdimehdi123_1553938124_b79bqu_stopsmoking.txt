Is quitting cold turkey the way?

Its been a few days, weeks that I am thinking of quitting cigarettes (smoking).. I am a sport guy doing a lot of sport ( 7-8 hours per day ) but I am also smoking a lot.. it affects my performance but more importantly my health. I really want to stop but how do you guys quit cold turkey ? I am new in this community and don’t know a lot about it also can’t find a lot of information about it

This is my last pack

I've been a smoker for 15 years, my entire adult life. It's difficult to imagine my life without cigarettes.  Up until last week I was smoking close to a pack a day and have managed to cut it down to five. I've been chewing the gum, which makes me want to have a cigarette even more.  Vaping a little bit, seems to be better than the gum at thwarting the cravings. I'm almost finished with "Allen Carr's Easy Way to Stop Smoking." I don't see how this will be easy, even cutting back has been difficult.  How did you all do it? Has anyone read that book and did it help?

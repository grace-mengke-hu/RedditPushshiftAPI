The Fateful Day

I've been lurking here for the past couple weeks working up the courage to quit. I am ready now. I saw a link on here to Allen Carr's quit smoking book, read it, good stuff and i know i am prepared to see it through this time. This will be my third full on quit this year. My first quit lasted 4 months, moved to a new city and was out one night meeting new people and caved, my second quit was this february on my birthday, made it one month, went back home for a week with friends and slipped up. (though i don't even remember(drunk)). The next day i was back to the city and boom, all of a sudden i found myself walking to the convienience store saying fuck it im going to smoke.. I still remember those few minutes of walking to the store.. It felt like a dark cloud was over me or something. damn nicotine. So this time is going to be different. Anyways i think i'll post some withdrawal symptoms(if any) the next few days so future quitters can know what to expect! Wish me luck! Smoke free heeeeeereeee we gooooo

My nicotine patches don't stay on so...I don't really even try.

My PCP has been begging me to quit smoking since he met me two years ago. Last week, I finally caved and told him I would make an honest effort. For three days I tried and the patches kept falling off so I kept making excuses to have a cigarette.

Also, knowing that I have no access to cigarettes, while wearing the patch, makes me crave one 10000 times more than if I have a couple lying around the house.

Am I crazy? I want to quit but my brain keeps telling me pretty much that my life will be over if I don't have cigarettes.

Sooooo emotional

I'm on day 8, and I'm feeling pretty good physically. Few cravings each day, but they're not bad at all. The hardest part for me has been the mental/emotional stuff. I've just been so down all week and I've been overreacting to everything (e.g., crying out of frustration, feeling super lonely, etc.). I know I just have to power through it, but I was just wondering when everyone noticed that their moods had begun to level out. Thanks!

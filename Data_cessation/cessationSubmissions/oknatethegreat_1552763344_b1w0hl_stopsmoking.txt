Keep having cigs in sight approach

One thing that worked that for me that most people probably think is really a dumb choice was keeping a pack of cigs out in plain sight in the house (they're  half opened and would probably suck to smoke now). 

It was the pack I decided to quit on. It's been 33 days since I've 100% quit ALL nicotine and I rarely have any urge to smoke amymlre. The two weeks were rough.  

My approach was me realizing that my mind works in a way where I just had to quit with them still in my sight/possession  because I used to be out of cigs and immediately couldn't resist immediately going to the gas station and the urges were too strong to resist. 

Now I see that pack and I rarely even think about it. It's eased the whole "I don't have one if I want one" anxiety which really got to me.

In my experience once you get through day 1, 2, and 3, the next milestone feels like 1 week, then 2, then a month. Ever since day 3 it has been SO MUCH EASIER. 

Even if you hate my approach idea if you're trying to quit I dare you to not smoke for 72 areas your brain takes on an almost Zen defense system which made it 24/7 easier for me.

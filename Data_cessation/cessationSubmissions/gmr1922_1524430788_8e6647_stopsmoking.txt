1 Month and 18 days without a cigarette. Still have a long way to go!

Almost 2 months without smoking a single cigarette. All this time and i still have cravings sometimes.
My hardest times are when I am at the coffee, or in a dinner with friends...
It's been hard , but it is not over yet. Keep going guys!

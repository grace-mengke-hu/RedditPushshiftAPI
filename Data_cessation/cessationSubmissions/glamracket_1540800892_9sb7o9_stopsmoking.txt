Ten years trying

Hey

I've been trying to quit for over a decade, every year trying one or two new techniques/methods.

Right now I'm living in the middle east where cigarettes are dirt cheap and I'm smoking more than ever ðŸ˜­

Has someone previously posted a list or schedule for quitting that I could try to follow? I usually try to do this alone and right now I have no other option so it'd be great to have some tips from other quitters.

Good luck to you all! It's great to see so many people managing to get rid of them.

Heart Attack Survey

Recently, to save money I started smoking cigarillos instead of my usual Winston Ultra Lights.  After a pack or two I felt felt a deadening and change in pressure in my chest and I got a light headed.  I know people can have silent heart attacks without realizing it, and that's what happened to me.  Then again yesterday when I ran to catch the bus I felt myself have another minor heart attack.  So I'm curious as to how many other people have had the same thing happen to them?

I'm 33 and I've been smoking a pack a day since I was 18, and I've been trying to quit for a while now, so I'm also hoping these first hand experiences can give us more motivation to quit.  There's also a [C. D. C. Ad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdmI35elnCQ) which talks about how someone at the age of 45 had a serious heart attack, which I'm starting to realize isn't that old.

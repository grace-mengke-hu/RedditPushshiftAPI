Day 10: Aching chest pains and anxiety

I'm reading through a bunch of posts so I already know these are normal symptoms of withdrawal. I was surprised how easy quitting was during first day or two.. I chalk it up to my strong excitement and willingness to make a change.. I had intense moments of cravings but they all dissipated after a few minutes with a bit of mindfulness/meditation or just distracting myself with some chore or entertainment. But around day 5-6 my chest got super tight and it hasn't gone away. It's bizarre to feel the physical symptoms of anxiety without mentally having anything to my anxious over. I've gone through a lot in the past few years and I know what panic attacks and anxiety feel like but this is the first time I only felt the chest tightness... I'm well over 100 days now off of alcohol which took a long time to get to and now cigarettes feel like a very manageable next hurdle... I guess I just wanted to vent and express my frustration a bit here.. this is manageable and I feel very confident that the worst is over, just gotta stay persistent.. Two days ago I did a four mile run and that really helped, so that's my plan tomorrow morning. 

Anyways..  sorry for rambling.. Just frustrated and wanted a forum to type something out to the world. Stay strong all you in the early days of quitting.. the withdrawal is nowhere near as bad as a life spent smoking/addicted to whatever.

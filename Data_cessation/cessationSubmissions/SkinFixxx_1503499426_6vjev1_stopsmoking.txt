Best way to stop smoking?

Hi, all! 

I quit smoking last summer for two months after wisdom teeth removal. I wasn't allowed to smoke during the healing process, so I just didn't buy anymore and stayed off of them for two months. It was easy to quit because I was passed out for basically 7 days with the pain meds. Then one night I was out with my friends and one thing lead to another ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Boom! Gross habit was back. I am 26. I have been smoking for ten years. Terrible, I know. I want to quit again, but I can't seem to get myself to do it. I will have my "last one" that night and wake up in the worst mood knowing I won't have one with my morning coffee. Then I cave and buy them so I don't bitch all day or be in a bad mood at work. How do you guys get in the mindset and prepared to stop?? I know you have to want it. I do. I just feel mentally weak. I have issues with depression and anxiety as well.

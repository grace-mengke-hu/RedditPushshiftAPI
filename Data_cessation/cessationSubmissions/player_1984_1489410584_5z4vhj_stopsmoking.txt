2 days and no cravings

I'm a non-smoker for 2 days now (I've read Allen Carr's Easyway). I didn't had a single craving untill now. Everytime I thought about smoking I felt really happy that I'm a non-smoker. When I remembered that morning cigarrete I remembered that I'm not a slave anymore and that there is no such thing as only one cigarrete, we all became hooked because of a single starting cigarrete.

Non-smoker and really happy :)

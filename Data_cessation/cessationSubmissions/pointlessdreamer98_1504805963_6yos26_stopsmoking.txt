Addiction

I'm sorry if this doesn't fit here but I accidentally put this in a meat smoking sr first ðŸ˜‚
Ok so up until recently I was addicted to cigarettes, but now if I even smell one I'm repulsed. I've made no effort to stop or change my habits but I end up putting out a cigarette after two puffs now. Is it possible to just drop an addiction like this? I'm happy but I don't know how it's happened.

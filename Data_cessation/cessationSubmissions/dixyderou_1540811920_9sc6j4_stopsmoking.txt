-3 to stop

Hi everybody i will try this journey for the second time.
I quit smoke for 7years.. then the last year i restarted to smoke like the idiot that i am.
I pointed the first of november for a new STOP.

This is my plan:
- work hard in the nature.. alone (i don't want to fight with people nervous i will be)
- stop also to drink every beer or wine ..no alchool at all
- i will got a cigarettes pack with me ..without use them,obviusly,  it has to be a choice ..i am always nervous when i am out of cigs

So cheer for me!

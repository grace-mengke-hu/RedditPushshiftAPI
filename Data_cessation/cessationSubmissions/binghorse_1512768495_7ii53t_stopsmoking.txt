Suicidal ideation after quitting?

It's been 4 days since I've quit, and I've felt like hell. My breathing is easier, but I can't stop thinking about how disappointing I am, how to kill myself, etc. etc. I've had these thoughts before while I was smoking, but they were never this intense.

Do these feelings go away, or at least return to normal? Because I swear I'll go back to smoking if I have to put up with this mental struggle much longer..

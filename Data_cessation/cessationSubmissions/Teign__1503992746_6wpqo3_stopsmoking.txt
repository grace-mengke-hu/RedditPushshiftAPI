The gum did help

I started on Nicotinell 2mg fruit gum last Tuesday. Disappointed various people by sneaking a few cigarettes at various times Wednesday, managed to go all day and night on Thursday, then had a 100 with a beer on Friday afternoon. By Saturday was resolved to quit. Ate a lot this weekend but the cravings have wound down now and I am three days smoke free and definitely feeling better. The posts here help. Thanks for the support.

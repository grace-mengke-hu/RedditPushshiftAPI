Oh god Reddit, please help me through my first day

Hey guys. First day on the patch. It was going well until right now. God I want a fucking cigarette so fucking bad. WHAT DO I DO? I'm doing stuff, cleaning, studying, etc. But this doesn't seem like enough to distract me. What did you guys do to get through your first day?

Update: I didn't cave! I went for a really long walk. I think it worked. You guys are fucking awesome I'm so glad to be here. Thanks for the encouragement.

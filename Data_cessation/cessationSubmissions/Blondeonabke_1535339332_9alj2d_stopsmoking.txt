Anxiety about my skin

I'm 32 and when I look in the mirror all I see if the premature aging I have caused from smoking since I was 14. I haven't smoked for 20 days but when I think about my skin I want to smoke so bad because I am self conscious and sad about it. I start to feel like I have ruined my life and these feeling just get worse and worse. Does anyone else feel like this? Also to the people who have quit have you seen any improvement on your skin and how long did it take?

I'm not ready to quit, but I HAVE to. It never felt like an addiction, I just enjoy smoking and it's making it so much harder.

Without going into too much detail, I'm having surgery next month and my doctor said I have to quit smoking or he won't do the surgery. I've been working on quitting for a month now and I'm at 6 1/2 days without a cigarette. I'm doing good at the moment but there are still times when I want to smoke. 

My problem is, I see where people talk about being controlled by the addiction and working their days around smoking, but it never felt like that for me. Could be just the addiction talking but in my mind, I smoked for 10 years because I enjoyed it. 

When someone told me I needed to quit so I wouldn't have to go out into the rain/cold/ to smoke, it was never a deterrent. I enjoyed it. If it was too rainy I'd wait a bit, if it was too cold I'd add another layer. But it didn't feel like I was going crazy needing to have a smoke it was more like "Oh it's raining? No big deal, I'll just grab an umbrella." 

Because of this it feels so hard to quit, not only because I'm not mentally ready but because it feels like an enjoyable activity is being taken away from me against my will. Any advice?

Did anyone else feel this way?

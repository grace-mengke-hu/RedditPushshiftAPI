Day 1....

As a lot of us have I've tried quitting multiple times. The thing is, on top of being tired of the awful health effects, I am engaged to a fucking nurse. I hid it from her for the two years that I began smoking daily (was a drunk social thing before then) and now whenever she asks and I admit to having smoked I feel like I am betraying her again and again. It's an awful feeling and I am tired of letting my life whither away while I also torment the one I love the most. Thanks to visiting this sub this morning I have a renewed strength to cut this shit out of my life and gain control of myself again. I don't know any of you but I appreciate all of you.

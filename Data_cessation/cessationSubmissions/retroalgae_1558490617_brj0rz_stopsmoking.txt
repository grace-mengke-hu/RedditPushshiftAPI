More alternatives?

hello, im 20 years old, (unfortunately) been smoking since i was 13 and was about a pack a day or so for 5 years. ive been clean for 10 days using a 3mg vape but its not doing a whole lot for me, wondering if anyone was in a similar boat to mine and could send some help my way. thanks!

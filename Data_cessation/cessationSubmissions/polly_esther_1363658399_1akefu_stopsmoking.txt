How I stay not smoking

Hi to all you lovely non-smokers!

I have got so much encouragement from others who have shared...here's what helps me.

I just decided I didn't want to be a smoker any more and I made a HUGE list as to why.  

Apart from the many many benefits of health and cost, my list has things like: 
* less laundry as clothes don't smell so bad = clothes will last longer 
* happier neighbours 
* hangovers will be less awful
* no more airport smoking rooms
* 20 less things to do each day

If I have a small pang I just refer to my list.  Pangs are receding!  

I also have two iPhone apps that help spell out my progress - My Quit Buddy and Since I Quit.

Good luck to everyone - this subreddit rocks.

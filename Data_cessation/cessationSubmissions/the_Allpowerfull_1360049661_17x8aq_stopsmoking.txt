Need help! College student who is always around friends who smoke. how do you stop the urge to bum when not buying a pack?

I have become sick of feeling shitty and not happy unless i have a cigarette. Been smoking for about 2 years and every time I try to quit I end up bumming one or two making the excuse that atleast i'm not buying a pack. Then inevitably days later I break down and buy a pack. What has worked for you guys to stop yourself?

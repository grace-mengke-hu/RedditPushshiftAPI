Okay it's been two days

As I expected it feels weird, but it's akin to changing a daily habit like when I've spent weeks playing the same video game or binge watching a show and now I finished it and don't know what to do with myself so I have to change things around and get busy with something else. 

I think there might be a few elitist addicts/quitters here who might think it's nothing for me to try and quit because I had the discipline to cut down. If you think so, I wouldn't mind hearing how the first few days of trying to quit was for you. What did the urge to want to smoke within the first few days of trying to quit feel like?

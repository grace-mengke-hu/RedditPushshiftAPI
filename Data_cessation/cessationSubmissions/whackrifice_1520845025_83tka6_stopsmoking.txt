Getting really aware of my triggers and I know I can't avoid them

In the past three days I've watched three friends go out to smoke, went to a bar, got drunk, had nightmares, had more food than I think I should be eating, got into and out of bed, had downtime between chores and work, got stressed about taxes and money, miscommunicated with my partner, got bored, cried a couple times, but I didn't smoke. How can you feel so weak and so strong at the same time? Huge victories by the hour, but they're just boring everyday things. Addiction works in really amazing and terrifying ways.

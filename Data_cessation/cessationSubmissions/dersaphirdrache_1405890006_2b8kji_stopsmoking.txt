I had quit for 8 months. Just "fell off." Feel terrible.

My SO and I had quit together. He didn't last. I just found out not too long ago(he had hidden it from me.) Got incredibly upset. We didn't speak for a few days. I've been a wreck, we had done it together, we had done something so great, we had lasted so long. I felt terrible, and after we reconciled I just couldn't wrap my head around it. So today, I got to a point where I gave up. I took a few drags from one of his. I figure, if we both failed, then I can't be upset. I feel juvenile at the moment. I feel terrible because I had been clean of nicotine for 8 months. I was free. Now I feel like i've fallen. I threw 8 months down the drain. I feel awful. I don't want to smoke anymore, but then I do. I guess I just needed to get this off of my chest, and to see if anyone has anything that might help, encouraging words are welcome, as well as ideas.(edit: ideas as in any alternatives to smoking, ways to stop smoking, helpful tips, anything)

Just finished 24 hours. Brief thoughts.


Will it get more difficult? I smoked a pack a day for about 11 years, today wasn't as bad as I thought it would be really. I had a few moments where I was thinking "Man, a cigarette sounds really nice" but I found a way to occupy myself for a few minutes and then it would pass. 

I definitely ate too much today. Ate breakfast (healthy), two lunches (unhealthy), afternoon yogurt (healthy), and then had a pizza dinner (unhealthy) so will probably need to work on that. 

But yeah, main question, will it get more difficult or will it get easier from here?

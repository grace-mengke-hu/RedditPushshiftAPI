Just 14 Hours and...

Long time lurker. 
Just 14 hours and I am beginning to think that this was probably not a good idea. Reason is -  some issues that have cropped up suddenly today, just 14 hours of me putting off the last cigarette. And this is not the first time I have "quit" quitting. 
I am thinking that maybe if I plan/set a quit date, it would be more effective. So here's the option that I am choosing from 
a. Keep smoking until you set a date, read allen carr's book then, and quit.
b. Be miserable right now and don't smoke and try to increase the number of hours you have been smoke free (i am getting a faint feeling that I will fail after some hours)

What do I do?

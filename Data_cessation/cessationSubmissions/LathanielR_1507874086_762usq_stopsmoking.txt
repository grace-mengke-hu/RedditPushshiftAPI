Thank you to the Veterans

I clicked on a link in a post here a few days ago, that led to a video. While some of the video was useful I found they were, shall we say unkind to the more experienced quitters. In the video they asked why these quit smoking forums had so many 100+ day quitters and suggested they find an alternative use for their time. My opinion is the more 100+ day quitters the better, who better to motivate fresh quitters? Who better to advise newbies? Just seeing their numbers eg 1100 days makes us believe it's possible. They usually the first yo respond with kind words if somebody is battling. Thank you for taking your time to help others, I for one am grateful

This is it

Hey guys, first time posting here. I've found this community before but never really opted to be a part of it. I'm stopping today! This is my first real burst of motivation to actually stop in a long while and I've downloaded the smoke free app to help. I feel like I'm finally ready. Thanks to you all for sharing all your stories, hopefully I'll have some success to share soon! Cheers to our long and prosperous lives

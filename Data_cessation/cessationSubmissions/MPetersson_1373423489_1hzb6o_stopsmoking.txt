1 Year!

July 9th of 2012 I smoked my last cigarette (although I have smoked a couple of cigars)after nearly 11 years of smoking nearly a pack a day. I made it and it was surprisingly easy. I just want to thank you guys as lurking in this subreddit helped me work up the courage to quit and to expose me to Allen Carr's book which helped a lot. Here's to year two of being smoke-free!!

Week 9: Found a full pack while putting my bike away for the winter.

I thought I was so thorough when I rid my environment of cigarettes back on quit day, November 1, 2016. The house, the car, at work, all the coat pockets in the closet, but I left out the caddy bag on my bike. 

After finding the unopened pack yesterday, I considered having just one. It felt like a Gollum-type conversation with myself. Minutes went by, just staring at it. I threw them to the floor, dug in my heel, picked them up and crushed it, and slammed them into the wall. I just kept it up until it became a cellophane-covered paper ball that I shot right into the trash from across the room.

I truly believe that it felt more satisfying than if I would have smoked. 

I haven't shared on here much at all, but I got a lot of help here by lurking in those early days. I wanted to remind my quitter community that while it gets loads easier as time goes on, occasional challenges do come up. And I choose to look at those moments this way: How often do you really get an opportunity to be a hero to yourself?

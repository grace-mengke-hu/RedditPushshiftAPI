Cravings are temporary even if they don't feel like that

Yesterday was a one huge craving. It felt like they will never go away and that I will forever crave them. And yet I didn't give in and I'm really glad about it because today I woke up and have no cravings at all. 

P.S 2 weeks cigarette and nicotine feel.

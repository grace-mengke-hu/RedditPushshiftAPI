relapsed, pissed as hell

I'm pissed because this is the millionth time I've done this, and I feel like a slave and it sucks. I quit again on May 31st and was going so well. Now I have to restart my badge, my quit date, it sucks, I wanna be able to say that I'll never smoke again, but I keep caving, fucking annoying

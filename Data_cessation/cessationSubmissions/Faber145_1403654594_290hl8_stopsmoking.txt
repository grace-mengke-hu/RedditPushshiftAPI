I did it

A little over a year ago I posted in this sub saying I'd quit by the end of summer and I was met by mixed but mostly positive comments and I've finally made it one year without smoking. I didn't read the book I just quit and I'm not saying everyone can do it but if you really want to quit it's all about just doing it. Congratulations to everyone else who has quit and good luck to those still trying to quit.

I've come to a conclusion. 

There's no such thing as quitting smoking. You either quit, or you smoke. If you tell your self and others that you're quitting, you're giving your self an excuse to smoke, even if it might be "less". It's bullshit. For me, at least... the days have gotten easier. You don't have time for quitting smoking, just quit, and be done with it. You have support. You have just cause. We are here for you.

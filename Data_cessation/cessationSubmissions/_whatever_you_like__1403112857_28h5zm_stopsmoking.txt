Okay Guys, I quit smoking, when the fuck does this rage go away?

Okay so Ive been completely smoke free for about 5 weeks now. (I know my badge is wrong Ive already requested an update)

I left this sub and just browsed over it occasionally because I just couldnt quit. Then I got my wisdom teeth out 5 weeks ago and the pain had me in bed for 5 days straight when I finally could move I realized I had been smoke free and just stayed that way. 

Im still having a lot of cravings and all I do is eat now. But honestly my biggest problem is the rage.

I have smashed all of the shit in my bedroom. I punch walls, I slam doors, I throw lamps. I go into serious rage anger issue shit. How do I get this under control?

Now I know a lot of you are going to say exercise. the problem is here im having a problem becoming addicted to excerise. I dont want to do it. Most of the time I feel lethargic and tired. How long does it take to get addicted to that. Cause im trying to jump on that bandwagon. I started running like the second week, but it only lasted a week. Any advice here? Im open to anything I have to get the rage under control.

In my dream last night I was offered a cigarette and refused. I think that's a good sign!

Been just over 3 weeks since quit. In my dream I was at a party and someone offered me a cigarette. I looked at it in my hand and someone lit it, I stared at it for a moment then set it down and walked away. If that's not a good sign that I'm getting over smoking then I don't know what is!

Fellow quitters who made it through with patches

Hi there. I’m 25 y/o and smoking a pack for almost 8 years. In 2018 general i’ve tried almost anything but patches. I went through without one puff 12 days thanks to Allen Carr. But nowadays i just can’t pass the day 5. I always relapse around the day 5. Is it make sense to go 15 days with patches(that’s all i have) and then stop using them also? I have 15 mg and 10 mg patches. I just can’t handle the start all over again. It might sound bitchy but i really upset when i saw 1 day,2 day on my screen. I thought it could be good idea to kick that gross habit that way. 

Thanks in advence. Native english speaker here, sorry :)

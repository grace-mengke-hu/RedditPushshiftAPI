Looking for hunger tips after quit smoking

It's been only 2 weeks and 2 days since I stopped smoking. I've been using nicotine patches (14g) to help me achieve my goal. I thought that the nicotine patch would help with problems like this (hunger) but so far it barely does and every day it feels worse. 

Most mornings I'm fine probably because I'm drinking coffee and/or tea (or at least I attribute it to it) but most evenings (after 4ish) can be really though. I've been trying to eat pistachios and sunflower seeds for a snack but I'm getting really annoyed with the continuity of the same thing over and over. Also lately I've felt the need to increase my food portions, especially dinner.

I guess in few words my questions are:
1) what snacks have you used or recommend?
2) do you know of something else other than coffee or green tea to supress appetite?

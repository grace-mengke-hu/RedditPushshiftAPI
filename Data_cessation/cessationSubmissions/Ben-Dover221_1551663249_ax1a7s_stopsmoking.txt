I always feel the need to smoke when I´m out drinking

I never smoke at home or in school. I don´t feel the need to. However, when I´m out drinking in any sort of social gathering I feel the need to smoke. I have asthma and my doctor told me my lunges can´t stand the damage from smoking. Is there a way to overcome this urge to smoke even when you´re drunk and careless ?

Can't stop won't stop eating

I've been a pack a day smoker for roughly ten years. I just hit the 24 hour mark. Withdrawals are similar to the effects of blow. My mind is now racing, my heart rate is jacked and my eyes are bugged. Absurd amounts of food have entered my body over this time period, yet I am still hungry. My head is pounding... I can do this.

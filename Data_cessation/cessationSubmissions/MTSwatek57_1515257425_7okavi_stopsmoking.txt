Today is my one year anniversary of quitting!

I started smoking when I was 17. Was a pack a day smoker for 4 years. This time last year I went to Arizona to visit my girlfriends family down there. Her uncle was just diagnosed with lung cancer, and she wanted me to try and not smoke in front of him. So I bought some patches. We were down there for an entire week. I was miserable the entire time, but I got through it to make her happy. When we got back home I fully intended to keep smoking. It wasn't my New Years resolution to quit or anything. I even had a full pack waiting for me that I bought before we left. When we got home I realized that a week was the longest I'd ever gone without one. Once I realized that I decided to see how long I could actually last. Eventually 1 week turned into 2, 2 weeks turned into a month, and before I knew I completed all 3 steps to the patch program. It wasn't easy and until I was 3 months clean I thought about smoking everyday. Today I feel better than have since before I started and I don't ever think about smoking anymore. I have never posted here, just been lurking, but reading everyone's stories of triumph has helped me this entire year. Thank you  to everyone who has posted here, or given advice to another user if they slipped up. You all gave me the strength and hope to keep this up.

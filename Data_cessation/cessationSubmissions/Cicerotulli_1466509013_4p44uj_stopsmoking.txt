Apparently, I smell disgusting

I use a car sharing app to travel. The travel companions get to rate each other at the end of the trips. I got a message yesterday that I had received a review from someone I travelled with last week. The reviewer said that although I was on time and very nice, I smelled of tobacco and it was really nasty in the car.

I had no idea I smelled so bad. I just bought a large pack of nicotine gum. Third quitting attempt, here I come!

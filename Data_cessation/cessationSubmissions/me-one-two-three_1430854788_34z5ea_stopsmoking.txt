I just don't know

I've been smoking for 7 years (haven't gone more than 3 hours without a cigarette since starting) I'm one of them people who doesn't really want to quit, I love smoking, it's so enjoyable and a great thing for many different reasons and I thought out of no where I'd quit. I'm 44 hours in (cold turkey) and I think I can actually deal with these cravings and withdrawal (as shit as it is) but I honestly think even without them I'd still miss smoking and want to do it. I've had 20 fags and a lighter in my pocket ever since my last cigarette 44 hours ago and still haven't smoked one, to me that kind of says I can fight the cravings but I know I just don't want to (or it could be me just making excuses to go have a tab)
 I'm really worried (almost convinced) I'll last 3 days or a week then I'll have a cigarette not because of physical cravings, but just because I miss smoking and want one and make this in pleasant craving period pointless, I just can't imagine never smoking again the same as I couldn't imagine never having a cup of tea, browsing reddit, watching the walking dead, having sex, eating chrisps etc all things I enjoy and wouldn't stop doing because eventhough I could stop having/ doing them, they're things I enjoy so why would I stop?
Sorry for the essay, thoughts?

TL;DR Currently stopping smoking cold turkey, doing well cold turkey but I know I don't want to stop

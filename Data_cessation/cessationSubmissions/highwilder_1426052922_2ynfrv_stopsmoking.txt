Changing weather brings me cravings

I really dig the Get Rich or Die Smoking app for Android because it has a slider that allows me to see the difference between the ten cigarettes a day I programmed into it ($1450 a year) and the pack a day I usually start smoking when the weather gets nicer and I'm out walking around. Now  when I am getting more cravings than normal I can see that I am benefitting myself even more (its mostly about the money to me, and not looking like a worn out sock at 50, and all the health benefits too I guess).

Using a nicotine patch?

Today is my day one without cigarettes, but i am using the patch.  I have heard people say it does not 'count' as quitting if I use the patch.  I say anything that will stop me from smoking is better than a cigarette.  I wanted to get some input from you guys, and see if you had any tips or advice as it relates to a nicotine patch?

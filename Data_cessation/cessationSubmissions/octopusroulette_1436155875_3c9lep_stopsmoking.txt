It's been about 24 hours now

So I made a deal with my friend, if he got a job by the 15th, I'd quit, which he's been nagging me to do. Well, he got the damn job so now I'm quitting cold turkey. I've been smoking for about 4 years with about a 6 month break somewhere in there. I have a single partial I keep as a backup in case it gets far too difficult which I picked up earlier only to set right back down. That may seem really stupid but I think it is helping knowing I can go back... like maybe it forces me to remember all the reasons I need to quit. If anybody has any suggestions or tips for me please let me know! I'm so happy I'm finally doing this(again.)

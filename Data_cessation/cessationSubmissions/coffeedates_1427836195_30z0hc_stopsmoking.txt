Day 7 and my easiest quit.

I posted a few days ago about how I'm quitting for maybe the sixth time in the past two years. My longest quit was sixth months and I relapsed because I thought I could smoke "just one cigarette."

You learn new things every time you quit and it gets easier. That's why they say don't quit quitting.

This time feels so natural and I know exactly what to expect. I've never had an easier time quitting cigarettes. 

Day 1 and Day 2 were actually pretty easy for me. It just felt weird not to smoke. On Day 3 and Day 4 I had some sweats and brain fog, lots of sarcasm. My blood sugar went down a bit so I drank juice. I didn't get too irritable, and I did my best to stay positive. Day 5 and 6 were super easy and I didn't have a single craving. Drinking coffee and alcohol hasn't caused huge cravings.

I'm definitely keeping my guard up but this feels like a good quit and it's felt that way for the past two days.

When I quit for six months I was the worst person, and so angry for about three months.

Quit now and keep trying often. It gets easier and easier.

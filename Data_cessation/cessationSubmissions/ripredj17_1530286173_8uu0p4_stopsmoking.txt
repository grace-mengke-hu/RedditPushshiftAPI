Just over 3 weeks smoke free!

So I’m using the Smoke Free stop smoking app and loving it. I think most of the people looking at this thread know what it is by now. In case you don’t , it’s an awesome app that motivates you to quit smoking. One feature is supplying daily missions to help you stay on track. Today my mission is to post some tips on what is working for me thus far.
1. Staying up with the app literally anytime I even think about a cigarette. I tried quitting before but was unsuccessful. This time, I log cravings, look at my progress, and remind myself of all the improvements to my health that I am making every time I say “No.” to another puff. 
2. Making sure my smoker friends know I quit. A lot of times my friends/coworkers will try to grab me for a smoke. Some of them don’t know I’ve quit yet. Every time I am asked to smoke, I tell them how long I have been without a cigarette and (the important part) one benefit I am already feeling from this. Saying how long and how much better I feel out loud every time really works for me. 
3. Chewing gum or killing a bottle of water whenever I have a strong craving. At this point, cravings are very rare. The first two weeks were the toughest part for me. The few times I do have a craving, I do my other steps and pop a piece of gum in. Cravings subside in minutes. 

I really hope this helps even one person! Good luck to the rest of my fellow quitters!

Smoking for 11 years, finally decided to stop smoking for ever today.

Hello everyone. 
I'm new to this subreddit but seeing all you people who quit smoking it made me realize that I should follow your lead. 

Some info about me; *I'm 27 years old and I've been smoking since I was 16. The last 8 years I'm smoking 2 packs a day and everyday that passes I feel worse. I used to have an allergy which made me have breathing problems and smoking turned the allergy to a permanent asthma and I have to use cortizone drugs before I sleep at night in order to sleep well and when I wake up I have to do it again, because I wake up with asthma.* 
I tried sometimes to quit but I never actually made it after 2-3 days and also used E-cig which kept me away from normal cigarettes for some days but after some time I was back at it.

I believe I never actually quit because I never took my decision seriously. Maybe because I had a lot of problems with work and family health issues which  probably made me not to want more "problems" in my mind, like quitting cigarettes.

Now things have changed, my family members are well and I am finally at a good job for which I don't have to worry every day.

Now it is time to quit for good and this is my final decision. I don't want to die young and with my breathing problems at the age of 27, I aint gonna make it to 40 if I continue or if I make it, I ll be going around with a breathing apparatus...

So, here's to living life and quitting that filthy habit!

As of now, 14:45 EEST (Greece) I just smoked my last cigarette while writing this post! 
I ll keep you updated with how it goes. I wish the best for all of you with quitting smoking!

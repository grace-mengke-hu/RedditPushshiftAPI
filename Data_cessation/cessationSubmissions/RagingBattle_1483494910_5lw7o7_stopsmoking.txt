I guess I'll remember these days forever

I quitted cold turkey 30 days ago. I was some sort of marlboro man, smoking at least 20 cigarettes per day and my friends couldn't figure me without a cig. For 30 days I had three packs of different types of rolling tobacco next to me and they didn't affect me.

I only had a few cravings easily dealt with...the real problem for me is that I'm starting to see how shitty my life is. It's something I can't get over, it's like I'm finding every little imperfection and getting stuck on them without being able to move on. I hope this feeling has something to do with the whole mechanism of gratification that it's slowly starting to work out properly.
So, be prepared, because nicotine is a drug, we weren't able to see reality for what it is and now it's exploding in front of us (or at least, in front of me).

This is the only major discomfort I experienced; don't think the whole process will be hard and tough, it isn't. It's simple, just don't smoke, and nothing scary will happen. If you're scared of what will happen or you don't think you can do it, remember that you're only being anxious and that what you're thinking will hardly become reality...you don't have the capacity to predict the future, don't you?

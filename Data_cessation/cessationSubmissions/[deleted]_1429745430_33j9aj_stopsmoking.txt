Question about lung health post-smoking.

I smoked for about 5 years, about half a pack a day, which I know pales in comparison to some smokers. Nonetheless I am very proud of me quitting. This is the first time I've seriously tried and I've been successful!! But, I worry that I may have done irreperable damage to my lungs. Can your lungs completely heal themselves give enough time?

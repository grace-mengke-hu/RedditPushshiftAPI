I'm finally doing it for the final time

I'm 19 studying at uni. 
- Mainly posting this for myself to update as I go and remind myself of my true goal.
- Smoking history:I started smoking shisha at the age of 12, started smoking cigs occasionally with friends at 14, and became a daily smoker at 16, been smoking a pack of 20 a day for the past year.
- Always tried stopping and never really did more than a week at most about 4 timea. For the first time in my life I'm properly stopping for myself because I want to stop, rather than because my family wanted me to stop or a friend bet  - So now I'm not smoking par weed and a vape with 3mg nicotine
- Today was my first day cigarette free and although I know this is nothing compared to how amazing i'll feel later in this journey, rather than half a lung, I feel like I can sort of breathe now. 
-The vape is not the same at all... think I might get a higher dosage today (6mg) 
I'm really craving a cigarette in its essence but I'm standing strong. Reminder that I'm breathing more easily now and my coughs are more "exile the tar!" Less "I can't breathe"

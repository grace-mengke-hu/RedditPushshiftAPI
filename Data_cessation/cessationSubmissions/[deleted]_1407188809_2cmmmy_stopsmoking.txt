24 hours and 43 minutes in

So there I was, Tropical Storm Bertha was heading to PR, and like every smoker I had to prepare and get the bare essentials. Bought myself two packs of Marlboro 100s...in less than 12 hours i smoke them both and I only realized this after looking for the second pack for at least 15 minutes. So what did I do? Mid-storm I went back to get more cigarettes..this time 3 packs... 12 hours later..same story looking for a pack I thought I had when in reality I had smoke over 5 packs in 36 odd hours. That was the moment that I knew something had to change. Headed to walgreens bought normal gum like crazy, two disposable e-cigarettes and I am now 24 hours and 43 minutes into quitting.

Is my mindset wrong?

Hi all, Im’m 19, been smoking for almost 4 years. I average about a pack a day (some days a little more, some days a little less). I’ve been trying to quit for as long as I can remember. My personal record is 52 days without smoking (about 9-10 months after I first started smoking).

I’m currently on my 8th day since my last quit. My latest failed attempt was about a month ago where I went 3 weeks without smoking. Then a burst of anger in a moment of weakness led me to start smoking again.

But this time it is a lot harder for me. Last time my mindset was “I most certainly will smoke sometime in the future, I just want to see how long I can go without doing it”. But this time I’m trying really hard to accept the fact that I will never have another puff in my life, ever. I’m constantly thinking about smoking and last night was the 3rd consecutive night where I dreamt about smoking.

It probably doesn’t help that at the same time I’m trying to kick a habit of prescription drugs with professional assistance. I think I would have no problem with smoking if it killed you in the blink of an eye at a random time, but dying slowly due to all types of diseases is such an emotional burden to you and the people around you that it’s not worth risking. That’s my only motivation.

Whenever I get cravings I remind myself of the possible consequences but today I found myself sitting in front of the convenience store, trying to convince myself to not buy a pack. I won that battle, but about an hour ago another intense craving hit and I searched the house for a cigarette. If I had found one, I would have smoked it. I’m so glad no cigarettes were in the house.

So my question is: is my current mindset wrong? My brain just won’t accept the fact that I won’t smoke another cigarette ever again. My last attempt was soooo much easier due to the laidback approach. I am in need of your wisdom fellas.

Thank you.

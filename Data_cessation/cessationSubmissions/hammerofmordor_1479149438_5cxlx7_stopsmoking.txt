Full time and Part Time Smokers Need to Quit

Hi Reddit, 

My SO and myself have decided that we need to quit smoking immediately. I'm not even sure where to start, especially because we are both different types of smokers. 

Him: Full time smoker, about a pack, or pack and a half a week. Stress smoker. Freaks out and gets angry when he doesn't have his fix. Been smoking about 10 years now. 

Me: I've been an on and off smoker my whole life, but for the past few years, I only smoke when I drink. I only drink 1-2 days a week if that, but I do love smoking when I do. If I'm out at a bar, I smoke quite a lot more than I would if I was just drinking at home. After about my 2nd glass of wine, I'm craving a smoke like it's crack. 


Does anyone have any suggestions on how to approach two different types of smoking addictions? I'm trying to get all of my ducks in a row, as well as any patches, gums, whatever it would take to get my SO to quit (he'll be the tough one, though he does want to) as well as some videos and photos of the consequences of smoking to really push him over the edge to want to quit.  

Where do I start?! What's the best method of quitting that people have had success with?

Also, is it possible to quit cigarettes while still remaining 420 friendly? 

I'm ready to be done with this disgusting habit, and I'm ready for my bf to stop killing himself.

Waking up this morning, gliding out of bed sans the blanket of regret that once held me down



It occurred to me that, if I so choose, I never again need to wake up with a hangover. I can always remember my sober day (6-5-14), I can keep a distant memory of my last visit to the liquor store (unable to look the attendant in the eyes, my hands shaking slightly as I hand him my dollars and change, The Cure playing on the radio as I grab my cheap 6pack and beeline towards my car with hopes that no acquaintances will spot me).
Today I don't feel overwhelmed with the notion of "forever" because I want life again. I know enough to know I won't feel this every single day, it could even vary moment to moment; but right now I can bask in my contentment of being sober/refreshed/clear-minded today. Happy Tuesday ya'll.

Seven days! New badge!

I almost didn't realize today that I'm still pretty new to quitting smoking. Seven days in and it feels like it's really starting to get easier. Days 1-3 were a breeze, but days 4-6 were pretty tough. Day 7 was starting to get better, and today (mid day) I haven't had any real cravings so far!

I also had a dentist appointment this morning and they cleaned off the disgusting black tar stains from my teeth. I've always been good about oral hygiene, but stupid cigarettes still made them look gross. They're nice and clean right now, and it's a relief knowing that they'll stay that way unless I screw up and start smoking for some idiotic reason.

I love being a non-smoker!

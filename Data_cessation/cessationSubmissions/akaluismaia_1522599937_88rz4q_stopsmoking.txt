2 weeks cold turkey

After two weeks of quitting smoking (cold turkey) I am feeling less stressed, but the desire for a cigarette keeps coming to my mind. I try to drink herbal tea and think about pleasant things.
The days of burning desire for cigarettes were on the first week after quitting, now the rage for tobacco is becoming smaller.

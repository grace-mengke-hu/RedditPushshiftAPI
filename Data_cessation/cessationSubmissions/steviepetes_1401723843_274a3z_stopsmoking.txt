Patio chainsmoking

After a harsh winter, summer has finally begun here. Previously I would find myself chainsmoking on every single possible patio. Yesterday I went out to a patio and was surrounded by chainsmokers. Then went to a BBQ where, again, I was surrounded by chainsmokers. 

I didn't smoke!

My throat hurts a bit this morning and I'm slightly irritated by all the second hand smoke but I'll gladly deal with that then go back to smoking! I felt free.

Almost made it 6 months(kind of)

I feel awful I'm starting my quit over again. I thought I could just bum a cig here and there but that is clearly not the case. It seemed fine for a while but now I'm pretty much back to smoking as much as I used to, 3 packs last week. This morning I woke up just feeling terrible, my voice was hoarse and stuffy breathing...was this how it used to be all the time? Then dumb old me bought 2 more packs today. Ive got to quit for good this time. I so badly want to be a non smoker!

I feel so guilty..

When i was a kid, i saw my father dying, day after day i would sit next to him in the hospital, while he suffered from cancer, why? because he smoked, I promised myself i won't be selfish and I won't smoke, and now? i started smoking, because my girlfriend left me, i feel like such an asshole..

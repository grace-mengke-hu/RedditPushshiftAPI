im an idiot and i love it!

im 19, been smoking almost a pack a day for about a yearish, was cutting down and eventually quit completely about 5 weeks ago after a few failed attempts and broken promises.

i read alan carrs book and was super cynical because of the style of the book (i felt like it was always trying to sell the book to me even though i had already bought it). I heard some crazy good news today about getting a job that fits in with my degree, figured i might as well head out and buy a pack as a celebration, just for old times. Paid 34 aus for a 20 pack, smoked one and realised it was doing absolutely nothing for me. Threw it out (something i wouldn't ever dream of doing before) and i feel ecstatic knowing that i had paid about 30 aus to figure out that i was completely done with this!

Even though I technically relapsed, to me this felt like a bigger achievement than any amount of days not smoked, this has eliminated that little doubt in my head about what im missing out on! 

keep fighting the good fight my friends!

I just need to share this..

I have been smoke-free for about 70 hours. I know it's not long, but I can already spot the differences. 
I can smell better, I can run faster without coughing and for the first time in years I don't have to open the windows in a cold winter afternoon just to smoke.

Ps: A smoker passed by me today and I really didn't like the smell. It was so weird.. I kept asking myself: Was this my smell over the past years?

Thanks for the support everyone! Keep it up!

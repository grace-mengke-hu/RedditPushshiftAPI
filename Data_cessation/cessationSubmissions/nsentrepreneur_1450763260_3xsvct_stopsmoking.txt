Allen carrs easy way

Stumbled onto this gem tonight after looking for a pill that might help me quit ( the idea of chantix scares the shit out of me so I'm avoiding it )  So I figured what the hell I'll start reading this book, I'm 26 pages in and following instructions thoroughly,  I actually found reading about smoking made me want to have a smoke so I went out about 5 mins ago. It's getting late here or I'd continue to read, but a lot of what he says does make sense and a lot of the stuff felt like he was in my head reading my thoughts , he is definitely on par with fears of quitting etc. Just wanted to post here for some encouragement , I recently fell off the Wagon and back to cigs ( I was using an ecig for 3 months) but I find those things are just a replacement for me and not a method of quitting

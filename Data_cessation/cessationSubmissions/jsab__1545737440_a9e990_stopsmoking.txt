cravings last 5 minutes?

Hey, I am still working on it so unfortunately no good post here.

I vape. Something I could never understand even when I was trying to stop smoking.

Everywhere they say that cravings last 5 to 10 minutes. Really?  
My cravings if I don't vape (or smoke in the past) are just constant.

Yesterday I was at a Christmas dinner, no smokers, drinking wine and I had those intense craving coming up and up and up never being satisfied even if I tried to ignore it.

I am just trying to find my strategies..  
I realize drinking myself to death (water) is a good one for work, so I can manage decently work.  
But at home or social occasions I will keep failing.

Anyway just interested in your experience and opinion about the "craving last 5 minutes"

thank

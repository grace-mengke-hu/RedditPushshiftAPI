How do you deal with your stress now?

It's been almost three months since I've smoked. It was easier in the beginning because I wasn't dealing with any stress at the time, but lately things have changed and I've been going through a lot of BS. I'm overwhelmed with the desire to sit outside and chain smoke, and I'm starting to question why I even quit in the first place.

Any tips on how to deal with stress? I've been sleeping/eating a lot more, which has obviously caused me to gain weight (another reason I'm doubting myself.)

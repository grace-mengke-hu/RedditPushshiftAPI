Alternative to do besides smoking

I don't even enjoy smoking as much as what it costs me. But when I'm working or gaming or doing something else indoors at home, I like being able to step out in the cool weather and having a smoke as a break. I quit for a few days a couple of times over the past few week. But I found myself wanting to go back outside for a few mins and have that something to do.

Is there anything else you can think of that I can do instead. A reason to step outside for a few mins, while also feeling engaged. Not like I'm just standing outside with no cause with nothing to do, but something I'm stepping out for.

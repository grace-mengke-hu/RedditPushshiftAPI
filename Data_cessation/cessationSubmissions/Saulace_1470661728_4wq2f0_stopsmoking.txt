Starting over. Need advice on controlling anger please.

I've viewed cigarettes as a sort of prison for the past year. Every time I try to quit, I find myself in situation where I observe rage but can't do anything to remove it. My prison was that I had to just keep smoking, keep my nicotine levels up, so I wouldn't rage.


I'm 10 hours in and know that the rage will come this evening or tomorrow. It always does. How might I fight it, or somehow magically make it not trigger, without lighting up?

Thanks ;/

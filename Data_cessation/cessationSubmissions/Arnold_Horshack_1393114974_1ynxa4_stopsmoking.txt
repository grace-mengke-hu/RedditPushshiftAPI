Last night of smoking. Patches and lozenges have been acquired. What can I expect?

I entered a stop smoking program from work, they provide the supplements for free, so I figured I would give it a try. I have been a pack-a-day smoker for 27 years, and have never attempted to quit before. I never really have wanted to, but now it feel that I need to. What are your best tricks to avoid smoking, especially in the first few days. How long before the strongest desires to smoke go away? Will I really turn into an asshole? How do you manage your composure? 

Wish me luck!!!!

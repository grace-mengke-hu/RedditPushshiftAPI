Have been cold turkey for 5 days... Have ridiculous flu-like symptoms (runny nose, plugged ears, etc.) how long did it take for you to get rid of it?

[Edit: I just realized it's been 6 days - not that it really matters much]

I thought it was a bad cold that hit me out of nowhere on Monday evening, so I bought some Equate NiteTime.  It's not that apparently as the drugs did nothing...and as I did some research, what I'm experiencing comes along with the disappearance of nicotine from the system.

Feeling pretty good in my chest area already though.  I smoked maybe a pack a week tops so not even *that* frequently.

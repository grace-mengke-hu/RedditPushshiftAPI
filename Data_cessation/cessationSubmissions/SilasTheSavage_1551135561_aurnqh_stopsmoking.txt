Tips and general help.

I'm a 15 year old teen who lives at a "boarding school". (It's basically a boarding school with a lot of free time and probably looser rules (i haven't been to a boarding school.))
I started taking snus (a bag of tobacco with some glass fiber to prick holes in your gum) about 6 months ago and started smoking 4 months ago. I decided that i wanted to quit recently since i don't want to be addicted for the rest of my teens and thus the rest of my life.
It has been really hard especially since a lot of my friend smoke and it's hard to resist if you can get one free.
Before i wanted to stop i smoked about 4 cigs a day, but when i was home on vacation, it was never really hard to have a break for a week or so, at the school where i live however it's really hard, more because of the temptations than actual cravings.

If anyone has some help, it'd be appreciated! :)

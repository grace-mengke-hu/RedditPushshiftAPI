First post- planning on quitting soon

Hi everyone, 

So I switched from cigs to a vaporizer about a two years ago, and I've been smoking since I was 18-19 somewhere in there. I'm 27 now and in the process of self evolution on several fronts. I really want to just stop right now but I have this huge work thing coming up which will be miserable without my nicotine. I might just give it a go to see how bad it gets, but my experience with habits/substances is that if I have access to it, I will be hard pressed to not use it. Right now I'm at 12 mg nicotine. I vape throughout the day, but usually only take a puff or two every 10-15 minutes. I can go fairly easily for a few hours without it if I have to, but beyond that I will get very agitated and need a puff. 

So anyway I just wanted to introduce myself and say I'm open to advice from people who have done this before. Thanks!

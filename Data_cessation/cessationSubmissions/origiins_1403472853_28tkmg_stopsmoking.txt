I don't want to give up smoking but a small part inside me does.

I've been smoking for four years now going through 10-20 fags a day depending on the social situation. 

Like most people it is part of my routine, I wake up go downstairs and have a fag (my favourite fag). Because of smoking I no longer eat breakfast, so I'll have 1 maybe 2 meals a day depending on how lazy I am. 

Smoking is what I do when I'm bored, hungry or whatever.

In all fairness I love smoking, anyone who knows me knows that and any attempts to get me to stop are met with a chuckle.

I have tried to stop, last year I went ten days without one but I cracked with the nerves of having to face my fear of public speaking. I then tried again this year and had better results but smoking is a big part of me and I quit quitting again.

So what can I do to get past all of this?

I know it's bad for you and it is expensive but at the moment I don't care.

I'm not overweight or anything so the idea of stopping to get stamina to lose weight isn't a factor either.

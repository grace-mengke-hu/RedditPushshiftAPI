Day 9 - The weekend was very hard

I stopped last weekend. It was rough but I got through it. I felt like my cravings fell off over the next few days until this weekend when they came back in force. Sitting down on the computer or chillin at home or whatever over the weekend was very tough for me again and I didn't expect that. I ended up eating cough drops all weekend to keep myself occupied.

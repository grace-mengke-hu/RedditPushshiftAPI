Day 3, Nicotine Free

This is my 3rd attempt at quitting. I'm using Chantix and a 0 mg vape for the social/emotional addiction. I am struggling quite a bit emotionally - I smoke with my friends, co-workers, etc. I know this is the best choice for me though.

Has anyone else used Chantix successfully to quit?

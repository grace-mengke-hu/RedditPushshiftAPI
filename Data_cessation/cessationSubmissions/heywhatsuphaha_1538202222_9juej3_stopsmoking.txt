I think cigarettes CAUSE mental illness

Since switching to vape, I’ve noticed I’m a much better person: more positive, clearheaded, etc. 
I believe the chemicals in cigarettes (the smoke itself too) cause mental health issues such as depression and anxiety and confusion and even schizophrenia. 
Is it a surprise that many schizophrenics smoke — when in reality it is the cigarettes that cause these sane people to become schizophrenic? Just my thoughts what do you guys think?

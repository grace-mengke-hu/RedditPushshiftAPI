Why did you quit and what is motivating you to stay off cigarettes?

For me, I quit because it was too expansive to maintain, the bad breath, the cough, how it would make would smell, and random sickness I would get. I'm sticking with the "Not even one" policy now because of the amazing change i had in my life from new good habits;  exercising, meditating up to good life management system. 
What about you?

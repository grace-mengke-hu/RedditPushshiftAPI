I keep trying to quit smoking. I don’t smoke all day, but when I have to work until midnight, I break and buy a new pack of cigarettes. The next day I smoke 4-5 of them, then I throw the rest away. Then I start the whole thing fresh. On top of if, I find lighters everywhere. I feel like I’m in hell

82 hours, each one a struggle.

Last night I was exposed to triggers for the first time since I quit Sunday. A bar, band practice, another bar.. I was weak, but my friends were supportive. There was one cigarette waiting for me when I got home. I had every intention of smoking it right when I got in the door, but at the last moment I ripped it up and went to bed. 

I'm doing much better today. No random fits of anger like yesterday and the day before. Come on hour 83!

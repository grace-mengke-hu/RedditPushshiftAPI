Severe cravings

So its now day 3. I expected the cravings but holy crappppp!!!! I've had cravings so bad I started hand washing clothes just to exhaust myself. I'm scared because my husband is coming home and he smokes. Quitting is also bringing out a tick of my bipolar that when I smoked didn't happen. I now can't sit still at all. I am constantly rocking back and forth. I also can't keep my legs still when laying down. Its feels like mania or severe depression is knocking on the door.

I quit yesterday and need some advice

I am used to a pack a day... today I have had eleven small drags... I plan to stop completely(meaning no drags at all) from right now. 
Im worried though because my mom says its not healthy to just drop it all at once...but I really dont want another one ever again. Whats your opinion on the best way to quit??

I was hoping you guys might have some advice? Also.. I have a few chest pains since cutting down just yesterday...is this normal??

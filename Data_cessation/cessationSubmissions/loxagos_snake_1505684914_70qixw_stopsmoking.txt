My advice to wannabe quitters (3 weeks and going)

Hi there! I'm 25 and I've been smoking since I was 21. I wasn't a particularly heavy smoker, averaging at 15 cigs a day. Of course, there were times when I either smoked a pack (usually when going out) or even a couple of them, one in the morning and one in the night. I have tried to quit twice in the past, but it didn't last more than 3 days. I used those experiences to get to the 3 week mark and I managed to surprise myself. I'd like to share my thoughts, opinions and experience with you. Keep in mind that the whole 'system' worked *for me*, and it might not work for you, or you might disagree with it. Either way, view it as someone else's quit story.

My problem with smoking wasn't so much the nicotine withdrawal. It sure did hit hard at my first two attempts, but I was able to take the headaches and the irritability was almost non-existent (I'm a daily meditator). I actually began smoking in such a way, that I had to fall in love with it. I shit you not, in my first two attempts, I was fantasizing about it as if it was some kind of unrequited love with an ex. It was the ritual, the situations during which I smoked that I was in love with. The mere thought of *not* rolling a cig while drinking my morning coffee or playing Counter Strike or studying was terrifying. What was *more* terrifying than that was lung cancer. It was the fact that while I'm an athletic young adult, I started gassing like a gramps in only five minutes of Jiu Jitsu sparring sessions. It was the fact that I could feel that weird feeling in my lungs, throat and mouth. I knew that the ride had to end somehow.

My first two attempts were a set-date cold turkey quit. Meaning, I decided to quit a week later, and until then, I prepared the stage by cutting down as much cigarettes per day as I could. On quit date, I'd smoke exactly zero - not tapering down to it gradually. For a variety of reasons, it didn't work and I was quickly back to the same numbers. I knew that it wouldn't work for me, so I had to resort to some sort of habit replacement. The obvious candidate was vaping, so I ordered a starter kit. Below are my tenets/advice that keep me away from being a smoker 3 weeks later. It is under no circumstances a walkthrough or rules set in stone. I find rules counterproductive in this case, to be honest.

* **No countdown timers**. I know this won't bode well in a subreddit where timers appear next to usernames, but it's my opinion and since it worked for me, I adopted it. I only remember that I stopped 24 days ago because it's only 24 days. Knowing that one slip up and I have to reset my progress on an imaginary scale scares the hell out of me, so I decided that having extra pressure wouldn't help the situation.

* **Vaping productively and smartly**. Yes, I'm aware that vaping *can* contain nicotine and it is definitely not 100% safe. But, it is nowhere near smoking and there is [new, original research that states it's 95% less dangerous.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/behindtheheadlines/news/2017-02-07-long-term-vaping-far-safer-than-smoking-says-landmark-study/). Now, if you can go cold turkey without NRT, good for you. *I couldn't*, so I chose the far lesser of two evils, with the intent of quitting both. I started out with 12 mg/ml and I'm currently vaping 0 mg/ml. And yes, it worked. Initially, I only puffed on it whenever I felt the urge to smoke. It helped me do a controlled quit in many aspects. For example, other than tapering down the nicotine, I started breaking the associations one by one, as best as I could. Result: I no longer reach for it when I wake up! The *strongest* habitual urge that I never believed I could move away from is already removed. In short, vaping remains a controversial subject and I'm not urging you to adopt it, but if you're struggling with your quit, I'd recommend doing your own research, weighing the pros and cons, and deciding if this is your cup of tea.

* **Letting go of guilt and limitations**. This is probably going to be frowned upon, but nevertheless...I decided that if I ever wanted to smoke a cigarette as an act of indulgence -just like having an extra drink- or to celebrate something, I'd go ahead and allow myself. I'm not talking about the usual junkie thoughts that prepare you for failure (i.e. 'I'll quit but only smoke socially'). I've been in several outings with my friends (they all smoke) and on one occasion I even forgot my vape. *I was perfectly fine*. Not a single urge. Then again, there was this extremely difficult exam that I managed to pass, and I decided to bum a cigarette with another student as a 'celebration'. I smoked half of it as the taste put me off, and that was it. I never touched another one, not felt the need to. Now, had I scolded myself and lived the rest of my day in guilt for 'ruining my quit timer', I know for sure that I would pass that day with a pack. On the other hand, I allowed myself to sin and have a little fun because I felt like it, and my quit turned out fine. I'm not advising you to do the same; you have to recognise this can be a slippery slope. But if you happen to be on it and slip, shrug it off. Really, stop beating yourselves up because you fucked up. We all do, what matters is that you jump back on that horse.

* **Create new associations**. I associated studying and smoking greatly. I literally couldn't focus if I didn't smoke during study sessions. Now, whenever I'm studying, instead of lighting up, I trained myself to grab a marker and write stuff on my whiteboard. Instead of puffing above a hard maths problem in frustration, I get up from my chair and engage my brain by solving it on the whiteboard. So, pick apart *every single trigger* and create a new one. 

I honestly hope the above will be of help to someone. I know some advice is controversial, but I'm putting it out here with sincere desire to give some extra options to people who struggle with quitting. The results of the above process is that I was faced with smoking a lot of times during those 3 weeks and I hardly struggled with it. It did take some self-restraint, of course, but it made the transition so smooth that I only 'broke' once and it didn't have lasting consequences. There are also countless benefits and as cliche as it sounds, try to think about them. I'm falling in love with my old, smokeless self again. I enjoy it every time my girlfriend tells me how nice I smell, how much better food tastes, how my sex drive has gone back to normal. Don't let the strictly physical warnings doctors give out fool you: smoking causes real mental issues as well. You might not realise it, but it subconsciously seeps your confidence as you're now a low-stamina walking ashtray reeking of tar. Not to mention the fact that *a piece of paper and tobacco* has made you its bitch. 

Stay safe, people. My best wishes to you. Remember, you're the master of your fate, you're the captain of your soul.

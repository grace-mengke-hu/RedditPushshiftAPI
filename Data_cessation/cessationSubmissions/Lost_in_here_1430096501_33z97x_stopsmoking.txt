Anyone else start to panic cry when they think (thought) about quitting?

ok, so I figure I sound like a dope but...
My husband quit smoking a few days ago. I want to quit too. Every day when I talk to my husband (he works away from home), I start to do the ugly cry because I haven't quit yet. I feel like a failure. I feel stupid. I've read Carr's book and it makes TOTAL SENSE. I am a smart woman. Logic and reason are my go-tos. But every time I sit down to have that last smoke, I start to cry. WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME??? I am a grown-ass woman and I'm crying like a baby who's having their  candy taken away. Nicotine is bad. Smoking is bad. I want to quit. Where has my logic and reason disappeared to? WHY can't I get a handle on it? Can anyone relate? My eyes and nose don't look good in puffy red, I'd like to stop crying. Thank you for *any* help.

I went 9 days...

I feel like crap. I went 9 and a half days. Everyone I know was congratulating me for quitting, I was super happy and felt so good. But then I got stuck... Couldn't get juice for my vape in time so I bought a pack :( I want to quit nicotine all together but I just can't right now because of school. Sorry I had to get this out there somehow...

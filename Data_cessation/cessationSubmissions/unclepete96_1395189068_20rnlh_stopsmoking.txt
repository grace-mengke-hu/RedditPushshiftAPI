Smoker since 14, im 18 now. I need to stop, any advice

So like the title says, I've been a smoker since i was 14. I'm now 18 and really beginning to feel the affects, but i just cant stop. I've tried the vapor, I've tried nic gum. Nothing is working, its almost like I enjoy dying. I need help, I cant go to my parents and teachers are fucking vague with it. I need real support.   

Edit - tI want to thanks all of you for you're support. since i posted this 3 days ago ive on day 1 with no cigarettes. i know that other people can only help so much, then its up too me. thanks again and i will keep you guys updated.

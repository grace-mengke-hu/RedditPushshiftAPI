How to get out of the casual smoker trap?

Long story short: I'm a casual smoker. I have a cigarette with drinks and maybe 5 a week in work when I'm stressed. 

I don't feel addicted because years ago I used to smoke 20 a day and I know what that feels like. 

Right now, I just feel like I'm missing out if I'm stressed and I don't get the little nicotine hit. I miss it, I don't crave it. 

I want to quit completely but because I smoke so little my brain doesn't seem to want to comply. 

I don't want to use a Vape pen because I genuinely believe that they're only useful for confirmed smokers as a quitting tool. For me I think one would end up getting me more addicted to nicotine. 

Anybody have any tips for just saying no? 

Really appreciate the help guys. Thanks.

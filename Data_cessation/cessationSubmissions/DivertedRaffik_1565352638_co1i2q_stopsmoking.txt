Why are the evenings so much harder?

I love waking up with a clear chest (and not having a mouth like an ashtray).  
I feel amazing all day, all afternoon (calm, relaxed, proud for not smoking).   
Then I get home and something changes in me. I reach for a cigarette. It feels impossible to get it out of my head.  

Anyone have the same problems?

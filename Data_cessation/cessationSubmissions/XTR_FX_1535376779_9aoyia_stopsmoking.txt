I gonna start now too

Its the worst habit i picked up . It started out of curiosity and now i just cannot stop .I smoke nearly 1 or 2 packs a cigarettes a day maybe even more than 10 packs when i have enough money .Its really the biggest hole in my pocket . I just cant do without it anymore . I used to be able to take brakes from it when i started now i just cannot stop it at all . I go out at the middle of the night just to buy cigarettes . Once i was stuck in a place where there are no shops at night . I was so desperate for a smoke i really searched out the cigarettes buds i had thrown and and light each on just to get a puff out of each bud . I am really ashamed of it . But sometimes i just cannot control the urge . My health has really taken a downward slope . Even climbing a small stairs leaves me exhausted and panting for breath .I just got a small break after a long time . I want to quit it for good i really thought about it .Whenever i try to smoke someone comes in with a pack and again i cannot stop . Recently i have started to develop pain in my chest . I wanna get back to health and be able to run or do something physical again .

Five days in

Five days in after fully quitting and I'm hacking up lots of brown phlegm, which I guess is a good thing. I had myself weaned down to four darts a day, and I'm realising that even that was having nasty effects.

Shoving fistfuls of nicorette gum in my face and trying to distract myself. It's probably going to be difficult next time I go out drinking, but for now I'm coping just fine.

Aside from being a little twitchy, physically I'm feeling good. I was getting headaches often, my mouth always tasted like shit, I smelled bad, I was sleeping badly, and going without poisoning myself made me feel even worse than poisoning myself.

Today, I slept great and I'm feeling more alert and energetic than I have in a long time, which is surprising me because I lived in fear of having to do anything without tobacco first. My chest feels lighter already, like a band around my trachea I didn't even notice was there has been cut free.

It's actually been easier than I expected, thankfully. I'm writing this down to get my thoughts straight and focused about it and affirm my decision to myself.

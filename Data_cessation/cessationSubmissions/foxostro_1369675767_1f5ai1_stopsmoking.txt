The Plan: three day backpacking trip with no access to tobacco

I think it's time to quit. I'm ready. My plan is to taper drastically to 1-2 cigarettes a day for the next few days. On Friday, I'm heading off on a backpacking trip in the middle of god-forsaken nowhere. For three days, I will have absolutely no access to cigarettes and couldn't relapse if I wanted. My hope is that this will be enough to really get past the worst, initial symptoms of withdrawl. With luck, the strenuous exercise will take my mind off of smoking... And when I get back, maybe it'll stick.

Is there anything I can do to help make this a more successful trip? For example, maybe it would work well to take some of that nicotine gum with me?

How can I expect the withdrawl symptoms to impact my ability to complete the hike? It seems like might need to actively plan around the withdrawl. For example, I how that quitting will cause my throat to become sore, I'll be hacking up mucous for a while as my lungs clear themselves out, and my muscles might ache a bit. So, should I expect my athletic ability to be noticeably impaired while in withdrawl? Will my body require more water than normal? How effective is ibuprofen at keeping the withdrawl-related muscle soreness down?

Wish me luck.

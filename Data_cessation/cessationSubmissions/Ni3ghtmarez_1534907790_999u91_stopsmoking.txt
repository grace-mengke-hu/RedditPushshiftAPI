Quitting tomorrow

Hey guys been smoking for about 9 years. I’m ready to kick the habit and I just discovered this sub. I’m really scared because I have quit for a few days before and it was awful. However, I’m going to make this my permanent attempt.

I have tried patches, gum, lozenges, trying to decrease slowly. I always manage to fuck it up like 2 days in. I average a pack a day sometimes more. I’ll try and update as frequently as possible. This is going to be hell.

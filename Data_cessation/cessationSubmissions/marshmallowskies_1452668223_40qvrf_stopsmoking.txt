The last drag I took just made me puke. I am DONE for GOOD.

I have been putting it off for a few months now, and finally decided to do it tonight because I took a drag of a cigarette and THREW UP...  It was the final straw and I have never had this happen to me before, but it will definitely be the last time.

No more excuses... no more delaying. I went so long before a relapse, and a relapse turned into three months of smoking. I will NOT let that three months turn into a lifetime!

I can't wait to go through withdrawals, get sick, feel pissy... all so that I can remember what I have put myself through, and that I will never EVER do it again!

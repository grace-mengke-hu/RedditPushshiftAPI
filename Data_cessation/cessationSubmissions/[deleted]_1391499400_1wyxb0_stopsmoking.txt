Had one (for nostalgia), but the desire to smoke is gone (yay, 3 weeks)

I have to be honest. I had _one_ because a friend of mine was moving away (after being put through some serious hell, long story), and it seemed appropriate.

This time, I didn't let the false smoker/non-smoker dichotomy derail me, and successfully beat back the urges for the next day or two. I'm back in a comfortable place (very rarely think about smoking).

My only regret is that there's so much snow outside. I'm loaded with energy and wish I could go running. Hang in there people :) You're closer than you know.

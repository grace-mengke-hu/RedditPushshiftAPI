Smoking aids after tooth extraction

I had a back tooth removed a little over a week ago and I canâ€™t seem to find anything that says how long I must wait before chewing nicotine gum or using a nicotine lozenge. I went the obligatory 3 days (almost) without smoking but have been smoking since then and would like to quit but I prefer the gum or lozenge to the patch. Anyone know how long? I really would appreciate any knowledge, thank you!

SMOKED MY LAST ONE TODAY

I'm quitting because cigarettes make me feel horrible. I'm changing my life in a positive way and along with eating healthier and starting a regular exercise regimen I know I can't be truly healthy without quitting cigarettes as well. So here I go! I'm so excited to be able to enjoy beautiful fresh air and extra money in my pockets! :-)

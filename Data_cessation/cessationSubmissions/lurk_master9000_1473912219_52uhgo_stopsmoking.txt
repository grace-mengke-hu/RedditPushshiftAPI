Holy cow I'm almost at a 1000

It's been a tough journey, but it's nice knowing I haven't bought a single pack of cigarettes in almost a 1000 days. 

I will admit there have been times that I've smoked drags of cigarettes (whilst on drugs) but I've never gone back to a full one or let alone an entire pack. 

I'm not proud that I've smoked at all, but we're all human and we all make mistakes, I'm just glad I've kept the bigger picture in mind and I can still say with confidence that I am and will continue to be a non-smoker. :)

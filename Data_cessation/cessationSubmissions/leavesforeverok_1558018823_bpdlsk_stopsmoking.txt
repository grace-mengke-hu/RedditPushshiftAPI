Wellbutrin is a miracle!

I am using the medication for about 2 weeks. It makes you feel nauseous and depressed when smoking, it also reduces a lot cravings, and helps with the low mood from quitting. I am 3 days smoke free and I am very confident. Remember, it's just an aid, you need to be commited to quit. Bupropion is not for everyone.

Day three, smoke free!

I am so glad I found this sub.  I have been a smoker for 23 years and finally decided to call it quits!  I'm a little surprised at how easy it has been to go cold turkey.  I definitely think about smoking approximately 1000 times a day but figure it's just part of breaking the habit.  I know some days are going to be harder than others, and I know there are those of you that think I'm a little too optimistic about how easy it has been so far, but dammit, I refuse to give up!

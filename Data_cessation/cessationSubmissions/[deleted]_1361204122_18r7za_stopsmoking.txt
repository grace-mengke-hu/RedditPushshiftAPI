Today marks 4 months.

The smell is starting to bother me at times. My girlfriend and I both smoke trees, and I can always tell when she's smoked before coming over just by kissing her; I can smell and taste it.. never have been able to before. 

My favorite part is when someone asks to bum a cig, "Sorry dude, I don't smoke cigs anymore." Also the employees at my local convenient stores ask if I need smokes, "Nope, I quit!"

I feel like I'm in the clear, finally. I literally owe it all to this sub. I've never found the motivation or will power to actually follow through with quitting before. Seeing all of you guys on here updating with how long since you're last cigarette, and also seeing some of you give in and start all over, it's all been so inspiring. The biggest thing for me was, "If I smoke a cig.. I'm letting myself down. I don't want to do that."

Advice to anyone wanting or just starting to quit; Believe in yourself. I've lived 24 years of my life with little self esteem, little self confidence, and a lack of will power. Overcoming this hell, believe it or not, was pretty easy. I even did it amongst some other very stressful obstacles going on.

Want to quit. Know you CAN quit. I believe in you.

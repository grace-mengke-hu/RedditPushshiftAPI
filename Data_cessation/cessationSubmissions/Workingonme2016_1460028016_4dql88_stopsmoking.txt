I started smoking again :-( how do I find it to stop again

I broke up with my boyfriend two days ago,  haven't gone through a breakup in years and forgot how stressful it was...I was 9 days into my quit....I really need your support to give me some great words of encouragement....so pissed at myself right now. I feel like a meth addict who just relapse(just to describe how bad I feel) please help....thanks everyone

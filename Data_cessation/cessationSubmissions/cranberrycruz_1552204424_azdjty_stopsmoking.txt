I was wrong.

I was one month free - got an intense craving and used a juul “once.” I didn’t feel anything, and I felt like I was free - I didn’t feel anything, so I must be free, right? But wow now I’ve smoked 3 cigs. I never would have dreamed of doing that before I broke my quit. Even if it feels bad it snags you somehow. Goddamn. I feel like shit.

I hate that it sucks you in even if it doesn’t frel good. What the hell is that? Why the fuck is it addictive even if it feels bad? If I say “never again” it makes me feel like I’m losing something, which makes me feel like I’m giving something up, which makes me want to do it - it makes me miss it, like I’ve “given something up.” But if I do it, I just hate myself and don’t feel good. How can I feel good about myself and quit? How can I stop for good and not feel like I’m missing something?

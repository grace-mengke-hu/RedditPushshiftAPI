You all can do this.

I deleted my old account but my quit date was November 3, 2015. Since then, my mom died, I jettisoned my crappy family and my job turned to shit. I would have smoked today but I didn't. And I'm not going to. I logged the craving and moved forward. I smoked for 30 years. Quit cold turkey because I thought I couldn't take care of my responsibilities if I didn't. You can do this.

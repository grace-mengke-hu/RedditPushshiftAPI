Needing to quit but getting anxious just thinking about it

Hey guys. I've actually been following this sub for some time now in an attempt to be inspired to quit. I need to quit and some days I want to more than others but right now I'm pretty broke for the next week and on my last pack so I figure now is the time. But as it gets closer I'm starting to panic about it more. Any time I've felt ready I just couldn't do it. And I don't feel ready now as it's a pretty stressful time in my life, but I don't see how I'll ever feel ready truly. I just am not really sure what to do and could use some advice and support at the moment. I have some gum on hand that expires next month and even an e cig that I could use once I'm out if this pack. 

Idk if it's relevant but I started when I was 12 and have been regularly smoking since I was 15. I'm 25 now.

Update abt my husband

Hey guys, you have all been so incredibly kind and helpful when I asked for advice for my husband! I am so super proud of him as he just finished day 10, something he never thought he could do. And your advice and support has been more valuable than you can know. I think it’s probably annoying that I’ve been asking for him, cuz he’s too intimidated (or something) to do Reddit, so it means the world to me that you shared your insights regardless. He had his surgery yesterday and I brought him home today. The doctor had told him that he had to quit, not because of smoke, but because of nicotine, so he couldn’t use patches or anything. Last night at the non-smoking VA hospital we were at, he told me it was the first day he didn’t have any nic fits! Yay! But before that, every night he would say “has anyone else on Reddit said anything?” It helped so much. Again, thank you all for being amazing. I’m sure I’ll be back. And I hope I (we) can help someone else as much as y’all have helped us.

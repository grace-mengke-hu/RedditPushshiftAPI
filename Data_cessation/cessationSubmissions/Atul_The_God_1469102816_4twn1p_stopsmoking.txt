First post here- quitting today

Hi guys I'm 24 and been smoking for a few years. Cigarettes have destroyed the happiness of my youth and made me feel like a fucking zombie. I think there are a lot of good people on this forum helping each other out so I am going to start posting here. Today is Day 1. I'm going for a run now to replace that shitty addiction and I am going to channelize my energy into positive things.

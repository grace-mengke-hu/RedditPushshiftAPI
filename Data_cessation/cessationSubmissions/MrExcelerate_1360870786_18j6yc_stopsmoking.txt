I am indoctrinated.

I quit smoking about three weeks ago -- and have not looked back since. My attitude has been continually positive. I started reading Allen Carr's book. I realized that I already held many of the same ideas brought up in the book. Then it struck me -- you motherfuckers indoctrinated me with Carr's idea's since I joined this sub-reddit and quitting these last weeks has been a breeze. I plan on finishing the book as I feel I owe him at least that. I was skeptical that a book would help me quit smoking but I don't think it's neither the encouragement, nor the community, that has given me the mind-set I need to quit. But rather, the knowledge that has been implied through posts and comments I have read that has been the primary motivator to my success. I'd like to thank the community for helping educate me and giving me the tools I needed to achieve this freedom. 

edit: my brother lit up a cigarette next to me the other day and it smelled toxic :)

TL;DR- Allen Carr 10/10

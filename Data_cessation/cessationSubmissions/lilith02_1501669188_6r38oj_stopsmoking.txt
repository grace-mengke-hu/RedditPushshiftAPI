Best Mouth Distraction?

I've been sucking on some sathers lemon drops and they really help keep me from constantly thinking about my addictions. However, they turn my mouth yellow and are full of sugar so they aren't good for my teeth. 

I've tried gum but it doesn't help me anywhere close to the lemon drops.

Anyone know of a substitute that won't wreck my teeth or color my mouth?

Question about nicotine patches

Hi all, hopefully this question doesn't seem silly... The info I found in a quick google search was unhelpful. I'm on day two of no cigarettes, primarily because I am flat broke and can't afford it anymore. I've been unsuccessfully trying to quit for a while and had some leftover nicotine patches from the most recent attempt, but I can't afford more. I have a ton of Step 2 (14mg) patches but very few of the 21mg that I need. Is it practical or harmful to use two Step 2 patches to help curb my cravings? 
Sorry if this isn't the best place for this question, I'm determined to make the quit this time and any other advice is welcome and appreciated.

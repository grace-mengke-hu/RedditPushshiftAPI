I had a plan for today

I bought a pack and decided to smoke only four cigars and then for the rest of the day to be on my e-cig.

Well I took only 4 cigs from the pack and threw it away and on my way to work I realized that I have forgotten the liquid for my e-cig.

I smoked all four and decided that I am quitting!

It's time... Day One... FILDI

I started smoking as an image thing. I thought that all writers were supposed to smoke, so I picked it up immediately after graduating high school. I'm about to start my last semester of college and I think I've really hurt myself. I don't need to smoke to write, to impress others, or to impress myself. FILDI. It's time. I just threw out my last pack.

I'm terrified; however, I know the power of the Reddit community. Please send me suggestions for music you like that I should know about. I want some new music to connect with quitting smoking to make the process easier.

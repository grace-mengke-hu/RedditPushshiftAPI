26 hours in, I need a replacement/outlet

So basically I'm a stay at home mom, I put smokes down for good yesterday morning for myself and my kids. Today, my toddler has been a frickin terror. Usually when she gets in one of her whiny moods I'll step out the glass door so I can make sure all is good and enjoy a small break and a smoke to relax. I need something else to do with my hands, I need my short breaks from her while I can still see her. I don't know what to do, I've cried twice today already. Any suggestions?

Three days without a smoke and I'm feelin' pretty stabby.

I smoked about a pack and a half a day for the past ten years, quit cold turkey three days ago exactly. So far I've experienced some pretty intense physical withdrawal - from irritability and headaches all the way to nausea, sweats, and an overall feeling of wanting to stab something beautiful in the face (repeatedly).

Today as I was visiting with a smoker friend at work a woman bolted out of her car and ran up to us. She immediately poked her head into the cloud of smoke and explained how she was just "looking for a smell". She then went on to tell us she quit smoking five years ago and has missed it every day since.

Does this get better? Is that lady an indication of how I'll feel in five years? At this point I'm feeling rather defeated.

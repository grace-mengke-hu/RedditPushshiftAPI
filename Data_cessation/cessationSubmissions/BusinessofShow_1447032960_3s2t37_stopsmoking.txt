2 Months!

I just got the 2 in my star and I am ecstatic. After smoking 1-2 packs a day for 18 years I have quit cold turkey and feel great. I have started working out every day, and have adopted the paleo diet. I feel like Superman, and it all started with quitting cigarettes. I never realized how much energy nicotine stole from me. I hope everyone who reads this will join me in not smoking today, and I know that all of you that do so will become healthier in every way.

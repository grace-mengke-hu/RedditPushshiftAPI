5 months as a non smoker feels great.......but you know what feels even better

When you go through a bad break up with a long term boyfriend, or when you get past the anniversary of your dads death or you have major stress going on at work (to the point I might quit after being here for over 5 years) and NOT ONCE did you smoke a cigarette. This is when you feel like you just may have a handle of this not smoking thing :)

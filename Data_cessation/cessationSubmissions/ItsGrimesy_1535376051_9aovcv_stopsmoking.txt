On the road to quitting

Hi all, I've recently decided to go to the doctor about stopping smoking, i've decided that its become such a problem its impacting my day to day life and i hate it, I'm only 17 so going to the doctor is scary, but I just wanted to ask for advice the back story is: I've been smoking since i was around 14 or 15, now (For the past few months) its gotten to the point where i can finish a 25g pouch in 3 days, which is 33ish a day sometimes less but around that, I find most if not all my free time (When im not at school) is spent smoking, Any tips on how to speak to my doctor about this? I just wanted to voice my story because if i have more people backing me i will be more successful. I'm afraid if i don't stop now i wont ever.

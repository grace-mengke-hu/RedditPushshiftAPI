Non supportive collegues

Hi all, almost one month smoke free, proud and gratefull of it. I find this subreddit empowering. Just want to get something out of my system. On work I have not so much collegues who smoke, but one was kind of a "friend"... The day I decided to stop, this person has not said one word anymore... Only that I am not going to make it... Not face to face, but at a moment I was not present... Really immature, annoying and actually it hurts... How can anyone be like this? Don't get me wrong, I am supported by actually all but this one person in my immediate circle... So I am in a pretty good place, which I just realize by writing this post... Though it still aches a bit... Can anyone relate? Some advice/suggestions how to look at this? Stay strong and freeðŸ’ª

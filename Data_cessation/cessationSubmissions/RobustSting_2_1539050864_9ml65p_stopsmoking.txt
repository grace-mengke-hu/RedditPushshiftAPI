“Well I don’t smoke THAT much” - My excuse. Quitting Day 2

So I usually go about 2-5 days without smoking during the week. Usually something like Sunday through Thursday. Then I smoke during the weekend. I always tell myself I don’t need to quit because I only have about five or so cigarettes every week. 

Those five cigarettes worsen my two years of suffering from a sinus infection. 
Those five cigarettes stink up my clothes so I can’t wear them to work anymore. 
Those five cigarettes make my tongue yellow the next morning. 
Those five cigarettes keep me in bed with lethargy the next morning. 
Those five cigarettes contradict my healthy eating and regular exercise. 
Those five cigarettes dry out my singing voice and deprive me from enjoyment while playing guitar. 
Those five cigarettes support the very same capitalist system I protest against. 

I am more than those five cigarettes. I am so ready to be fucking done. 

I started smoking when I was 12. In 25 now. I’ve “tried” to quit more times than I can count on my fingers and toes. I mean it this time. 

Any tips?

Not a smoker, but quit dipping 13 days ago.

It's interesting to me how when you go from a can every two days to none how your brain tries to rationalize the habit. 
I learned that there are certain trigger moments that make my brain slightly hurt where I'd normally dip like at the bar or when work is stressing me the fuck out. I'm becoming more aware of unrestful feelings every day. My mouth is less dry which is nice. Definitely feels like shit when you dip half a can from being drunk the night before. 

My goal is to quit permanently and just go back to my once in a blue moon cigar/cigarette. I never really liked smoking much so smokeless tobacco was the way to go. 

Anyways, just a huge rant sort of. Are there any other dippers in here quitting? 

Tl;dr quit dipping. Brain crashes in certain situations where I'd use tobacco. Getting over it.

I need help

Hi guys. Long time lurker. I have quit weed for 3 months, and I want to quit nicotine for 1 month now but I always end up buying 2-5 cigarettes a day out of a pack and smoking them. Im crying now , i feel like i cant do this. Everytime i light up, the guilt strangles me, but im weak. Quitting weed was def. much easier.

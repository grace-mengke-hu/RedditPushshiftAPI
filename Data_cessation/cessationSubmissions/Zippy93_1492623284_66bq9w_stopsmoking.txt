Hope I don't relapse into smoking after finding out what I need to do to graduate in under two years. Been in school since Fall of 2014

Summer classes, 15 credits fall of 2017, 16 credits of Spring 2018, 15 credits Fall of 2018. Then I graduate early December of 2018. This next year and a half is going to be mental agony but I'm going to do what needs to be done. Been in school for far too long.

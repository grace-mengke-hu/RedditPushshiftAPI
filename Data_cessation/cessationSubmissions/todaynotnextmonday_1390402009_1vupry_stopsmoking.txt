Day 2

I am quitting smoking.

I had stopped smoking in the past for more than a month when I had to because of dental procedures, so I know that I can. However recently I've had a few unsuccessful attempts to quit and the critical moments are usually when I'm with my smoker friends (most of my friends unfortunately) and/or drunk (and I spent a few last months in a country where smoking inside bars is allowed so it was too easy to use this circumstance as an excuse...) However since a month and a half ago when I decided that I do want to quit smoking I've smoked no more than 10 packs (instead of smoking a pack daily) but I am ready to ditch the cigarettes completely. 

Annnd I'm writing all of this because I'm seeking some kind of accountability I guess: in a few hours I will be meeting with my smoker friend and we'll have a couple of beers and I will probably want to light up but I won't. It will be one of the first times I'll have refused a cigarette but not the last!

Sorry for possible mistakes and stay strong everyone!

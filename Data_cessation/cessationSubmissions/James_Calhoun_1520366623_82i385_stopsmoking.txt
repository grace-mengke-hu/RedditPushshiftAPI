Checking in

So, I wanted to drop by and saw my counter and I smiled at the fact that I've almost reached 200 days. Two hundred days! From a pack a day smoker to 200 days without a single puff. This is going to sound like a clich√©, but it's true, the only regret I have is that I didn't start sooner and that my previous attempts didn't stick. The incredible and numerous benefits of ditching those cancerous sticks are amazing and they just keep on coming (literally).  

* I can breathe. Have you ever noticed how awesome and calming a big, deep, breath is without the feeling you're going to die? When I am at the office I can run up the stairs and I stand in awe of the fact that I do that so easily, without coughing and getting out of breath. 
* I started to exercise. A lot. In the beginning I was a bit worried about the weight gain people usually report and although I have gained a little weight, I am losing that now through exercise and proper diet. It's awesome to run and cycle and just getting a good workout for your body. Building and training your body is a lot more fun than destroying your body. 
* I don't have to leave the table every 10 minutes when I'm out for dinner with my non-smoking friends. It's so much easier to follow a conversation if I don't miss a part because I went for a cigarette, again. A few weeks ago, I went out with a good friend of mine, who still smokes. He had to go out every 10 minutes or so and because we were together I decided to join him outside. After three times I became a bit annoyed and was like: AGAIN?! Do you have to go out AGAIN? And then I realized I used to be like that, but not anymore!
* The money. Euros. They're everywhere now. I am a MILLIONAIRE! No, just kidding. But I do have a lot more money I can put to better use. I bought new clothes, workout clothes and I took my mother on a trip to Poland. Money well spent instead of throwing it away, begging for lung cancer. 
* My morning coffee. I always thought that without a cigarette (or two), my morning coffee wouldn't be the same. Boy was I wrong. I thoroughly enjoy my morning coffee now, because I can taste and smell so much better. Plus, I don't have my morning cough anymore, so drinking liquids is a much easier and smoother process now. 
* The skin on my fingers have a normal, healthy color and glow. No more yellow/brownish stains on them from holding/smoking cigarettes. 

My first quit didn't stick. I always cracked after a few weeks, or after one or two months. But this time it's different and I truly feel that I ditched the cigarettes for good. Sometimes I have an odd craving, but it's only a matter of seconds before its gone. For those on the fence about quitting or not, or for those who have yet failed another quit: get (back) on that horse, it's so, so, so, SO FREAKING WORTH IT!

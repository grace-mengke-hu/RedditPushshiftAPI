12 days Smoke Free &amp; Frightened

My husband and I both quit smoking. Me 12 days him 11. He’s going back home to Nebraska because his mother just past, I’m staying home to run the business. His brother is a chain smoker I’m frightened he’s going to start again then come home a smoker, any advice?
I’ve been submerging myself in healthy diet and exercising to avoid the cigarettes, but it seems he’s only traded one bad addiction (smoking) for drinking alcohol! I can’t be around him, any advice, I’m tired of the smoking and alcohol!

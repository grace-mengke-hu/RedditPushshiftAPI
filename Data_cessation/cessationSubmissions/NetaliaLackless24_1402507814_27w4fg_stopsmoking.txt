1 month, baby!

Finally hit 30 days on my phone app that tracks days/tar/money etc. So stoked. I quit using Allen Carr's method and never looked back. Still feeling better every day after smoking 1.5 packs for about 14 years!


Biggest things I've noticed are:


*  How deep a breath I can take. I feel like it's at least three times as deep as I could when smoking. 


*  Sense of smell/taste. Mostly smell. Man, there is a lot of scent out there that smoking cuts out of your life. Also, I had to clean (and will soon be detailing) my car and also dust my apartment. It smelled like an attic and I had no idea. Taste is good too, but I mostly just notice when I'm eating something that I put a decent amount of spices in. Hoping it will keep getting better, and I think it will because every day I can smell a little bit better than the day before.


To all of the people at less than 30 days, keep at it. You want to know how day 30 feels! And whatever works for you is what works for you, but I'd recommend Allen Carr's book to anyone trying to quit. In the last month I've loaned it to two friends AND my dad who have all quit as well, which is a great feeling.


Good luck everyone, and thanks for the support and info on this sub!

Day 1... again

Been lurking for a while. Thought I would make a post here, maybe it'll help distract me. Been smoking ~1 pack a day for a while now, having trouble resisting walking over to unimart to get a pack. Tried quitting 5+ times before, hopefully this time will be the last. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

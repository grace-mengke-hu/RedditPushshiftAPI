List to remind myself how awful smoking is

Made a little list to remind myself how much smoking and being a smoker sucks and thought I'd share :)  
* I calculated that in my 14 yrs of smoking I have spent approx **1 year and one month** literally just breathing toxic fumes into my lungs, because I believed that it gave me satisfaction. In return I got absolutely NOTHING. Just the 'joy' of poisoning myself and feeling CONSTANTLY hungry.  
* Every puff has given me, besides nicotine, also carbon monoxide, which means that my body was deprived of oxygen and the extra carbon monoxide was circulating in my blood stream even [4 hours later](http://whyquit.com/ffn/03c-breathing.html) (that also means that in 14 years I basically only got enough oxygen while I was sleeping!)  
* Nicotine itself is a [central nervous system stimulant](http://whyquit.com/whyquit/LinksAAddiction.html), which means every puff of smoke activated my body's fight or flight response (similar thing happens during an anxiety attack)  
* Nicotine made my brain constantly grow or generate more and more [nicotinic-type acetylcholine](http://whyquit.com/ffn/01c-tolerance.html) receptors and it would be IMPOSSIBLE to fill them all with nicotine. Meaning that the more I smoked the bigger the withdrawal/hunger for nicotine got and it would be IMPOSSIBLE to ever satisfy that hunger!  
* Nicotine messed with my digestion. Every puff of smoke activated my body's fight or flight response which dumped stored fats and sugars from my [liver into my bloodstream](http://whyquit.com/ffn/03e-meals.html) (also explains why for years I only ate late in the evening and smoked away the whole day).  
* After putting a smoke out, the nicotine from it started leaving my body immediately. Which means that I started getting withdrawal the moment I put my smoke out!  
* Nicotine caused a constant withdrawal/hunger and only relieved SOME of it while making that withdrawal/hunger bigger and bigger  with each smoke (more and more receptors). Meaning that nicotine just created extra stress and then took SOME of it away (while still leaving me with added stress!!)  
* NO ONE IS ACTUALLY ADDICTED TO NICOTINE. Nicotine literally only creates the hunger for itself. Only 'satisfaction' from smoking I ever got was getting a new dose of nicotine which created an illusion of satisfying that hunger, but actually only continued that hunger and kept making it bigger. What hooked me was believing that illusion and being convinced that nicotine relieves anything.  
* Every smoke, beginning from the very first one, created the hunger for the next one. Which means that there is NO 'one smoke' or 'one puff' (only thing they'll give me is withdrawal/hunger for MORE nicotine). There is only a CHAIN of withdrawal and constant hunger for poison.  
* I was a slave for 14 years. The most important thing in my life was to have a smoke, because while I wasn't smoking I was in withdrawal (nicotine leaving the body). And even when I was smoking, after awhile I couldn't relieve all of the withdrawal while puffing away. Which means that for YEARS I have literally been in constant withdrawal.  
These are the things that really struck home to me. I know there's a lot of repetition lol, but honestly I feel like I need that to really get it clearly into my head. This way I can keep coming back to it if I need to.
The most insane is the fact that from 28 years of my life I have literally spent ONE YEAR puffing this shit into my lungs, like holy crap. I also didn't know about carbon monoxide before and how it was still in my body even 4 hours after a smoke!  
Also the fact that nicotine activates the fight or flight response was interesting, because on some level I still believed that smoking relaxes me (how ridiculous tbh).  
I still feel that there's brainwashing left, but for the first time I also feel that it's finally starting to disappear/break away!

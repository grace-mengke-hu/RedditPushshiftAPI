Struggling to control emotions

Hi guys, I’m currently taking champix and I made it 23 days without having a cigarette but after a really bad day at work on Friday I had a few cigarettes. I find it really hard to be able to cope when I’m stressed / angry / upset and I can’t get the thought of needing a cigarette out of my head until I have to have one. Does anyone have any tips for overcoming this? Thanks all

My fianc√© and I are quitting tomorrow.

We are expecting, and it's time to put this idiotic habit behind us. I am not looking forward to the inevitable bitch fest that will be going on between the two of us, but I'm trying to stay positive. Have any of you ever quit along side a SO? How did it go with the irritability and withdrawals?

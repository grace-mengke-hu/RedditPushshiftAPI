36 years old with a pulmonary embolus

I'm 36, I'm a vascular surgeon, and 7 days ago, I was a 1.5ppd smoker. that is, until I ended up in the ER with chest pain & coughing up blood only to find I had bilateral pulmonary embolisms with some necrotic lung... all thanks to smoking while taking birth control.  I've been smoking for 10 years, it is the only stress relief I had at work... & weirdly, it made me feel closer to my patients. I understood what they were going through. But like all 30 something year olds, I felt invincible. And in one day, I'm not. I'm on 6 different meds now including blood thinners & inhalers & can barely walk up a flight of stairs with being short of breath. Last week, I was running 15-20 miles a week. sigh. 

But, I'm 7 days out... I'm alive. and I'm a non-smoker.  and it feels good.

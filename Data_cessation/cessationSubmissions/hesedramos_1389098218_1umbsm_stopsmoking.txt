One year ago today! :D

So today I just celebrated being a non-smoker for a year. Ladies. :D

It's been an incredible experience, slowly getting everything back. My sense of taste, my sense of smell, my ability to run longer than six seconds... everything is fantastic!

I decided to go cold turkey and I chose the time my then-supervisor would be out of the country on business (2 weeks) because he's my smoking buddy. The first two weeks were the hardest. And I had a breakup around month 10, so that was very trying, also. I had to constantly remind myself that smoking will not fix what broke. It'll still be broken after I finish.

I'd be happy to answer any questions others might have! I want to contribute to your quit, also. :D

I'm 16 and I'm starting to smoke..

Before you judge - which most likely you already have - I have started smoking late at night and basically when I feel a bit shitty or stressed I smoke.
Whenever I get worried about stuff such as my relationship or whenever the stress of exams get on top of me, I have one cigarette most days but I feel my dependence on smoking is slowly getting bigger and bigger.
I want to stop, but whenever I feel the urge, I just do it. I smoke on my own, my Mum knows and has no opinion and is secretly raging. I know if it gets round my family, they'll treat me like shit and judge me to hell.
What I'm asking for is: what is something else I can use as an alternative to smoking because I worry that I will get hooked.
My friend started smoking on the way home from school and I was totally against it, then all of a sudden I was open to trying it.
My life right now isn't the happiest and I smoking numbs the pain of everything.
Thanks.

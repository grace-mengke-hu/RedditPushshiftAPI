First try ever.

24 years old. Heavy smoker for 8 years now. Been thinking about quitting for quite some time now and my doctor finally gave me the reality check I needed to take the first step. He advised to quit the cigarettes and taper off the nicotine using a replacement product.

I'm scared but I know the discomfort I face now will pay off in the long run.

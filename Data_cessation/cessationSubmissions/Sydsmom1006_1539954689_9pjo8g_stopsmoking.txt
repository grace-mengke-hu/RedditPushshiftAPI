I've made it 4 days &amp; that's huge for me!

Hi everyone. I smoked my last cigarette this past Monday on my way home from work. I've smoked for about 22 years. I quit while I was pregnant with my daughter in 2001, but started again when I was no longer able to breastfeed. I tried quitting again in 2012 when my employer started an incentive program. I made it about 6 months, but allowed the stress of the holidays to get to me. I'm praying this is it. I'm using a vape right now &amp; it's really helping. I heard about this page in the smoke free app that I downloaded yesterday. Good luck to everyone!

Feeling trapped...

Hello everyone!

I've been battling nicotine addiction for quite some time now. For the past 4 months I've been using nicotine spray, which killed the cravings, but I got really addicted to it to the point I was even using more nicotine than with smoking.

So I decided to get rid of the nicotine itself. The first few days was horrible (insomnia, extreme irritability, you name it...) than it got managable... I stayed quit for 14 days and then, the day before yesterday, I had a few beers and I was feeling like I would never feel happy anymore without the cigarette. So I smoked like 7 cigs in 2 hours. The next day I felt so shitty for smoking again I didn't even want to get out of bed....then I started a new quit.

The real problem is that I'm feeling VERY asocial without smoking, I even stopped going out with friends cuz I fear I would smoke. I'm planning on moving to a bigger city, where all my friends live and I'm feeling extremely hopeless about this. Is it possible to be around friends who smoke, or have a few beers with them and not smoke, and not feel like a miserable pile of shit? Cuz now I feel really trapped in this city, due to the fact that the only reason I can't move is because I fear I will start smoking again.

I'm feeling really paralysed by not smoking. Does it get better with the social thing? Any advice would be highly appreciated.

When will I stop fighting myself?

This  is day 32. I thought my struggle would be done by now \- smoking would be  something I used to do. Most of the material I read told me to hang on  to 3 weeks. I was told all the cravings and the mind games last for that  time and I went through with it because I believed it.


I  expected it to end and I was looking forward to it like you wont believe. Everyday I kept pushing myself to reach the 21 day mark. And it  came and just went by. It dint even feel like a milestone.


Today  is day 32 and I don't feel like I've "defeated" smoking. I'm not saying  I haven't had the benefits, I have, loads of them. But inspite of the  benefits, my mind still wants me to smoke and comes up with new ways to  convince me. Everyday I wrestle my way out of these thoughts but it gets tiring and I don't know how long I can do this. I have this feeling  someday I might just give up and cave in.


Has anyone experienced this? Does it ever go away? And when? I need something good to look forward to.

If Not Now, When?

I just passed my 11 month milestone and I'm getting closer to the big one year mark. I was recently reminded of the single thought that instigated my quit smoking path. 

Nearly a year ago I was thinking about quitting smoking for the umpteenth time and my mind was listing off its excuses of why it wasn't the right time to quit smoking. My mind was repeating the same track it usually did about why it would be better for me to quit sometime in the future. Maybe next weekend? Maybe next month? Maybe later in the year? Any time in the future was good, just not right now.

Finally, I got so frustrated with myself that I demanded to know, "if not now, when". That's when I realized the excuses were stalling tactics to put off quitting smoking for my future self to deal with someday. Then the obvious finally occurred to me; the issue of quitting smoking was never going to go away on its own. The only way to quit smoking was to actually quit smoking. No amount of stalling was going to change that fact.

In high school I had a teacher who was fond of saying, "don't wait until you're too old to figure out life is a do-it-yourself job." Quitting smoking is a do-it-yourself job. Nobody is going to swoop in and save you from yourself. Nobody can quit smoking for you. 

But, the greatest take away from knowing life is a do-it-yourself job is you are in complete control of your life. You don't have to keep smoking if you don't want to. You don't have to keep the identity of a being a smoker. You don't have to throw away your extra income every month on cigarettes. You don't have to poison yourself. 

You can save yourself from yourself. You have the power to take control of your life and steer it in the direction you want it to go.

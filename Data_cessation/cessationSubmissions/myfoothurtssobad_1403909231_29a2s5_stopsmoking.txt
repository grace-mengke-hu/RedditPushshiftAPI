Relapsed two weeks ago. I feel completely sick, I can barely stand it.

My badge says 102 days!? Well that just annoys me that I have to reset it now. Stupid.

I've fallen back into my smoking habit and I'm hating it. I went two months, and it was just great. Loved the energy boost, some days I felt like I could keep going all day long. Not today. Lately since the relapse I'm completely exhausted, I feel too tired to make even minimal efforts of activity. Actually, I feel too tired to even get off the couch. Taking a short walk takes much larger amounts of effort, and breathing is hard. Daily headaches I used to have when I smoked are back. They went away when I quit. And irritable. I'm so irritable. 

Seems like they're even worse this time around. Can't stand it, so I'm quitting again. It's a lot less daunting this time knowing I went two months and it wasn't that bad. So here I go again.

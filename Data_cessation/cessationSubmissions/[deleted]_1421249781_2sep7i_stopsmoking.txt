Going out for drinks with friends for the first time after quitting

I am not going to smoke

Step 1 Don't smoke

Step 2 $$$

Step 3 profit!

Edit :Okay guys. I'm home now. I am pretty wasted. Had a more than few and I am very drunk right now BUT I did not smoke!  All(I don't have many friends) my friends that I met today smoke BIT I did not. Thank fully they supported me. When I was offered a smoke I declined and said I WWW as trying to quit. None of them asked me twice. When I said I am trying to quit all of them supported me. I hope everyone gets ft ends like this. 

I stay in India. So here we can get one cig for 10 bucks(very cheap, A packet costs a 200/while a beer costs 250) at the local pan wala. While going back I had this urge to stop at the local pan shop(as usual) which I did, but instead of asking for losse CIG I just had a paan and walked away. 

After 12 days I don't feel the need of a CIG even AFter I  rrunkm I only have this community to thank for. Reading and relating to struggle of anons over the internet helped me a.lot. 

Even though we might be divided by geography, religion, and opinions we still at least agree on one fact that smoking is bad. So let's keep out differences apart and treat smoking as an addiction on par with drugs such as heroin and an addiction.

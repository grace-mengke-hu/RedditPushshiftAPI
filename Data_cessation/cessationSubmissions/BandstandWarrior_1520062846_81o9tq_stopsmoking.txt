Drink is the devil

Every attempt I've made has been undone by myself when drunk. Been on and off the smokes since October last year. A month here, three weeks there, eventually tapering off to a week, a few days etc. Etc. 

Gonna stay off the drink for three months. Definitely want to stop now, I can tell this is definitely the time when I kick them. I've been off them a week. The Allan Carr method planted the seed that I don't enjoy them. I focused too much on following the instructions perfectly (I have issues with anxiety) which I think created a phobia. Just gonna take the main points and do what works for me. Anyway, thanks for reading.

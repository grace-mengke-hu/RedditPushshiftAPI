19 Days. Here's what's worked, and what hasn't. YMMV.

4 years ago, I quit for a few months with the EasyWay book.

I've tried to read it again, but couldn't 'get it' the second time.

**Here's what worked for me:**

This time, I bought the audio book version (I think it was called Stop Smoking Now, and was like $6 - the price of one pack of cigarettes). I listened to the entirety of the book while running (it's about 4 hours long), and smoked the final cigarette at his request, inhaling that shit through a kleenex. This last part was important, because I actually smoked a few cigarettes before I was ready to listen to the final chapter, and seeing that tar or whatever in the kleenex grossed me out.

Since then, I listened to the book once more, and have started it a third time (although I haven't been motivated to finish it again). I experienced some weird anxiety the first few days, which I didn't associate until later with smoking withdrawals. Since then, I've had a few mild cravings if I watch a movie where someone is smoking, or if I encounter a former trigger (for me, arriving home after work). Then I remember that I'm free of that trap, and that I would hate to get trapped again, and that I would feel bad if I relapsed, and that smoking doesn't actually fix the problem - it just makes it worse!

I've been running a lot (since before I quit), and it's awesome to be able to tell myself that my lungs feel better now that I don't have to carry around that baggage. If I get a craving while running, it feels friggin crazy, because why would I want to make my run harder!?

I also followed some of the missions in the Smoke Free iPhone app, including telling 5 friends. This one was tough, because I was a secret smoker, but it's been cathartic talking to my running buddy, as well as another friend who used to be a smoker. 

**Here's what hasn't worked for me:**

I bought Chantix 2 years ago, but was never able to convince myself to go on it because of the possible side effects. I'm glad I didn't, because I think it's much better to not desire a smoke than to desire one and not think you're enjoying it.

I tried e-cigs, but never got the same feeling from them. They were too hard to suck through, and they didn't give the same 'buzz'. I would always end up smoking regular cigarettes (the same number as usual) afterwards.

In the past, I've tried nicotine patches and gum. Didn't work long term, and they were expensive.

Good luck y'all. See you on the other side.

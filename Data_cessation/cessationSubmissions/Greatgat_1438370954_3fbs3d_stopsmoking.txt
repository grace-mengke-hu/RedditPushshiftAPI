Quit date is tomorrow 8/1

And I've soooo been looking forward to it. A couple months ago the girlfriend and I decided that would be the day we both stop. I think with the both of us doing it, that will help. Either that or they'll find one of our bodies in a shallow grave next to some railroad tracks, whichevs.

I've been tired of smoking for some time now and I feel good about stopping. I'm looking forward to tasting food and getting my sense of smell back. I've been looking forward to not blowing so much damn money also (pack a day future ex-smoker).

So here goes, I know it'll be tough. I'll probably want to backslide, but I hope I can fight the urge off.

Wish me luck! And luck to the others that are tired of this smoking nonsense as well.

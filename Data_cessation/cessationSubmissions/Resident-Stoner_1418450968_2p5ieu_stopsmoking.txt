Trying to quit smoking, looking at Personal Vaporiser alternative (UK)

As the title says, I'm try to quit smoking cigarettes. I'm not yet 20 but have been smoking for nearly 5 years. A few of my friends have been cutting down by using personal vaporisers and substituting the cigs for e-liquid. I'm looking at joining them and hopefully improving my health and regaining my previously alright lungs.

My question is, what personal vaporisers do you guys (and gals) think are the best? Some of my friends are using little £10 jobbies which are great, whereas another friend has bought an absolute weapon that's set him back around £60. I'm looking for anything between £10-30. 

Any help is much appreciated, I've read some of the success stories from here and I would like to be part of that group. Thanks in advance :)

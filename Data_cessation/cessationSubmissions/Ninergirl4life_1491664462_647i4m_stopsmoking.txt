Looking forward to 1 week


I'm on day 5, it feels great and I look forward to every single day that goes by that I'm a non smoker! I smoked for 20 years and have tried to quit numerous times! This is my time, not even one more puff! My husband smokes and quite a few of my friends smoke so the temptation is real but I've stayed strong so far and I intend to keep it up!

I bathed in the toxins of cigarettes to quit

I notice we all hate the smell of cigs and the aftertaste.
Sometimes we hate it so much, it's repulsive to even think we could smoke one again. But ofcourse beast comes around.
I chain smoked so much I threw up 5 times in a row in an hour. I took a pack and blended it with water and drank half the cup. I lit cigs up in my car and got the smell all over my clothes so I'd have to smell it all day.
I lit a cig up and put it out on my wrist and it left a burn mark I will never forget. It's been 3 weeks and 2 days, and boy do I hate those Duffy Fluffy Stinky Inky pookie hookies now :-)

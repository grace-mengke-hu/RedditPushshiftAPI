Trying to quit again

Hi stopsmoking,

So I've been smoking on-off for 3 years and have usually had no problem just stopping whenever I feel like it. But now I'm finding it really difficult to quit even though I've been smoking less than 10 a day. 

I do want to quit, because I don't really enjoy it anymore. I just get light headed, nauseous and left with a horrible taste in my mouth. But I always find myself lighting up whenever I particularly want a smoke; it's only afterwards I feel regret.

Any thoughts?

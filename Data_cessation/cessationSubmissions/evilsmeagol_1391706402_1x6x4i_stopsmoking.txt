Should I feel proud or am I an idiot?

A little more than two weeks ago the cravings got so bad that I went out and bought one, but decided to smoke it at home, on the way up I got it together and didn't smoke. Its been lying on the table all that time sometimes I feel proud and sometimes I feel like an idiot.

I can finally smell again!

I feel like a whole new world has opened up right before my nose. Everywhere I go, every building I walk into, and all the food I'm eating now has a smell. It actually puts me more at ease and its really sort of soothing. My only complaints so far are that my lungs hurt 24/7 and every morning I wake up I feel like I smoked a pack the night before. I'm also feeling sort of depressed but I attribute that to my brain not getting its nicotine fix. I'm still going strong though; I've made it through two nights of drinking without even the slightest desire to smoke a cigarette. Thanks for all the inspiration /r/stopsmoking!

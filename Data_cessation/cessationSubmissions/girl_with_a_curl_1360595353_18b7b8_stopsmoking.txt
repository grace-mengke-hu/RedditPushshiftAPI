WTF immune system??  1 month quit and I'm sick as a dog - anyone else experience this?

Now, I realize its cold season, and the weather has not been working in my favor either (I'm in Upstate NY, winter is no joke around here), but I thought I was supposed to get *healthier* when I quit smoking??


Backstory:  I smoked for about 10 yrs from roughtly 18-28 yrs old.  Usually about 10 a day, sometimes up to a full pack (20) a day, though that was pretty rare.  I had my last cigarette on 1/8/13.  Quit cold-turkey, and doing shockingly great with it.  No slip ups, hardly any cravings to begin with, and pretty much no cravings at all now.  I just decided I was done & I was done.


Anyway, last Thursday, just shy of the 1-month mark I was feeling really crappy and went home from work early.  I pretty much spent from Thursday at 3pm til Monday at 7am when I got up for work either on the couch or in my bed, sick as a dog.  I didnt' leave the house once.  Horrible congestion - mostly head/sinus, some chest, excrutiating body aches, sore throat, THE-FUCKING-WORKS.  I *still* feel horrible, I probably shouldn't even be at work now but I couldn't afford to miss another day.


So, what gives?  The first time I get sick as a non-smoker I get completed knocked on my ass? Usually I'm able to work through any colds I get, or maybe take it easy for a day and I'm good as new.  Now, for the first time in 10 years I'm not clogging my lungs with disgusting black tar and I'm completely ravaged by a common cold?  That's just not fair!  I'm finally trying to get healthy and my body is acting it's most feeble!


I don't know if the point of this is to rant or ask a question...  I think its both.  Has anyone else experienced something like this?  Your immune system actually being weaker after you quit?

Weekend smoking

I quit smoking over a year, however over the last 3 months i have been giving into temptation on the weekends and smoking 3-8 cigarettes in a night.

I've been justifying smoking on friday or saturday nights and I'm creating social situations in which i can justify smoking. E.g. inviting a friend who smokes around to drink knowing we will sit around outside chatting, drinking, and smoking all night.

I havnt been tempted to smoke again mid week, but i find myself looking forward to having a cigarette and a drink on the weekend when work is done.

I know im on a slippery slope here, is it possible to smoke only on the weekends without eventuallu relapsing?

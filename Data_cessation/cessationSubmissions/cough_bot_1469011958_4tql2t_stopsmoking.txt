I never thought it would be me. Day 1 cold turkey.

I always hated smoking, parents smoked, I always wanted them to quit, friends smoked, I always thought it was gross. I picked it up when my life got really stressed last year, and after 1 year of it I can say that it's the stupidest addiction ever.

Yeah, it feels good. Yeah, you form rituals and habits and your brain wants you to continue them.

But every time I sat down to smoke one I knew I was taking time off my life, I feel sick all the time, I'm weak, I'm starting to get so unhealthy from smoking constantly and just not taking care of myself that I can't even take a mile walk without feeling dead.

It's stupid. It hurts your health, it'll kill you. and knowing how stupid of a habit it is is what is going to allow me to never have one again.

I never thought I'd make such a bad choice, it really makes me want to re-examine all my other choices.

[CLUB 31] OK this is it. Just want to say thank you for everyone being so supportive here. And especially to /u/oncemoreuntobreach for inspiring me to make today my FINAL quit day. I'm proud and excited to be in club 31.

If you are a lurker like I was, join the club and quit for the 31 days of december!!

Today I begin a new life without nicotine.

Monday, October 6th, 2014. My quit date. After 4 years of smoking, tomorrow I will wake up and not have a cigarette. 

I started when I was 19, coincidentally the legal drinking age in Ontario, Canada. Before then, I would smoke the odd cigarette when drinking, or drive around my city with a couple friends and have one with them. I officially started with one of my university roommates - I would accompany him out for the odd smoke here and there. The odd smoke turned into buying my own packs, and I quickly became a "smoker". Soon most of my best friends and my brother were smokers, and our front porch became the cool place to hang out. It was definitely a social thing on top of the physical addiction. Now that I've graduated university, I think I romanticize those times a bit in my own head. I no longer have my smoker friends constantly over at my house, which will definitely help me ditch the habit. 

I was always embarrassed by my addiction, and I would hide it from as many people as possible - parents, bosses, coworkers, figures of authority in my life. I am looking forward to not having to hide my habit anymore. 

The thing that has spurred me to quit is my lack of energy as of late. I have been unemployed for the past 6 months, and been in a bit of a rut about it. I think I have a job opportunity on the horizon, which I am looking forward to, but these past few months have been rough. I've been in a spiral of staying home, not having the energy to do much with my day, and SMOKING. My addiction, in conjunction with my employment situation, left me with very little willpower to go out and make each day special, fulfilling, spent doing what I love with the people I love. That is about to change. Going rock climbing with my SO tomorrow (who has been nagging me to quit for years) and I plan to use this forward momentum of activity to help me get through these next few days without nicotine.

Other things I look forward to in being a non-smoker:
- Having white teeth again.
- Getting the most out of my lifting workouts. 
- Not feeling trapped during those long meetings, plane/train rides, and other situations where I can't smoke. 
- Having more energy during my down-time.

Wish me luck. I am ready to ditch this habit for good.

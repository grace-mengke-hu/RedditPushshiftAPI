Going on day four, today is going to be the toughest.

Hi everyone, going on day four without a cigarette.  The reason to stop was due more to the unnecessary cost of cigarettes.  After looking through my transactions for the past month is when I realized I smoked over 30 packs.  Smoking isn't something I want to be spending my money on.  I have also cut back on eating out, and other unnecessary purchases.

Anyways today is going to be the toughest because I will be hanging with my friends, who all smoke.  The social pressure is really going to make it tough, but I think I can do it.

Just figured I would post and give me something to follow up on, something to keep me somewhat accountable.

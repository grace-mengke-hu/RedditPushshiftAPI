Need support and advice

I'm cutting back- I've had eight cigs in the past 24 hours, down from close to a pack a day.  I'm feeling frustrated and want to go sit outside and smoke on the porch until the sun goes down.  Chantix was a crazy train... what's my next step to finish this terrible habit?  I'm a mom with a six year old and a husband that just beat cancer- this habit must go.  Help a nice lady who hates the habit and can't quite let go yet.

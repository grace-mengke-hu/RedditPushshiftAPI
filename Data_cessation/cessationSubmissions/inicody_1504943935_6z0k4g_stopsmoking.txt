I need help quitting nicotine.

I tried cigarettes and I quit then easily I couldn't stand the smell but I switched to vape a little one like a Juul but it's called a phix, has a shit ton of nicotine loaded and it gets me so buzzed to the point I'm numb or can't drive. Been like 8 months on this and still works great, never really tried to stop but I know I can't because I'm always like I just want a little buzz it's okay. 

It's gotten so bad, I don't want this to be my lifestyle and I literally can't go a day without getting atleast a big buzz in morning, 3 throughout the day and a shitton at night. What do I do what are ways I can stop because it's so fucking hard I get headaches and feel like shit. I am really trapped. Help me please.

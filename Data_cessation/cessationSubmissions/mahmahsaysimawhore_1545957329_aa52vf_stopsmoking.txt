I turn 16 tomorrow and need to quit while I still can

It’s been like almost a day since I’ve had my last cigarette... and I’m DYinG. I don’t have a vape anymore and I told my parents i would quit BEFORE my birthday which is tomorrow. And I still haven’t quit. I cut back a LOT but I still haven’t quit. I’m down to one cigarette a day. But I haven’t had one today. Since tomorrow is my bday, I’ll probably finish my pack. And then after that I’m done. I would have to go out of my way to get another pack, and I won’t. But I really need a cigarette right now. Trying to distract myself but it’s really fucking hard.

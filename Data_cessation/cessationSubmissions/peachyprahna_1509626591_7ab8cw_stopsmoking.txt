“Not today”

Why is this mantra so prevalent in quitting? 
Why does every gram of effort you put into your will power tank get unarmed the second you realise life is happening and you’re unsure of what life is exactly without smoking? 

This line of thinking has kept me in the hole. The very, very ugly hole. There is always something that is cropping up. A tired day. A stressful working day. Relationship problems. Social interaction. Boredom. Going to the city. 

How can you squash this voice in your head and make it very clear that you’re not going to give in no matter what?

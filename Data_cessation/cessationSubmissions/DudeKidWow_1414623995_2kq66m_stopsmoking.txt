When does smoking become a problem?

Recently picked it back up again. I'm a college senior, 22, bought a pack a few weeks ago to get over a really bad day. Hadn't smoked seriously for about 3 years. 

Now I'm on pack #3, have smoked every night (1-3 cigs) since I bought the first pack.

Pros:
I put headphones on after a long day and enjoy a cigarette (I feel invincible). I'm not known as a smoker, I only do it when I'm alone. Although in the past, going outside for a smoke makes a group really intimate.

Cons: 
Its kind of expensive. I feel like I can smell the smoke through my skin's pores even the next day. I have an occasional cough. A LOT of people, especially girls, hate smokers.

At this point, I've been through smoking in the past. I know how addicting it is. This may sound like 'justifying a bad behavior' but is there any value in smoking? Should smoking be black/white as in addicted/non-smoker? Hypothetically could a person smoke an occasional cigarette (maybe in a social situation) without being classified as a 'smoker'?

Alright... Today is the day

Day 1, just smoked my last cigarette 30 mins ago, now just to stay insanely busy enough to simply not have enough time to relapse, all of my previous attempts failed due to getting bored in the evenings. Note to self: there is always something more productive to do than sit on my bum and smoke , always.

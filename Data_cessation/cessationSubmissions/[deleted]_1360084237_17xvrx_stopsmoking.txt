Did anyone experience stomach problems while they were smoking?

I'm just now starting to quit. I've had stomach problems for the past 5 or 6 months, but never really attributed them to smoking. My dad suggested that my cause of stomach problems could be attributed to the smoking, since I started having them around the time I hit 1 year of smoking.

The symptoms I have been experiencing are bloating, some constipation, nausea feelings, "prickly" sensations on my stomach, and a sort of "acidic feeling" in the stomach. None of these symptoms were very painful, all of them except the prickly sensations and the acidic feeling went away with change in my diet.

My question is what stomach problems and symptoms were you experiencing during smoking?

Quitting and depression.

Hello everyone! New subscriber, but I have been quit for two months as of today. It has been difficult, but Champix has been taking the edge off quite nicely.

I have a question about depression and quitting smoking. I have felt, in the past two months, like I am going to break down at any given moment; this comes on suddenly and without warning. I have been having strange dreams, but nothing I can remember, they just leave me feeling extremely uneasy and sad most of the time, which gets me off to a bad start to my day.

The worst part is that it's not even that I *do* break down, because I haven't yet, it's the nagging feeling of potentially turning into a puddle.

Either way. I'm mostly here for support, and to see if anyone else has experienced this, and what they've done to help.

Thank you!

Almost a week clean, but anxiety is giving me a ride.

I never thought I would get addicted, got heavily into vape and basically chained all day long. I used it as a coping mechanism, stopped once I got to college but then about 2 weeks in I broke and took a hit and it never felt so good, got then I proceeded to chain vape even harder than before, to the point of near vomiting every day. I realized that I couldn't keep pushing shit down with the smoke and finding a way out, I needed to stop. After one week I feel accomplished yet also I'm at that point where I feel like my quality of life has gone down as I can't focus almost to the point of paranoia. I need to go to a counselor, but it's too late in the day for that right now so just thought I would post on here and get my feelings out somehow. I'm proud of myself and of all of you for committing to this journey. Good luck everyone.

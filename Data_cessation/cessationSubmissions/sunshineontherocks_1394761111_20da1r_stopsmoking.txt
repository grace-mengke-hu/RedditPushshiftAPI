Are the benefits of quitting just an average? Or a will definitely happen?

I've been smoke free for eleven days and haven't been able to notice a drop in my heart rate. It used to be in the 60s and it averages high 70s low 80s, which is where it was at when I was smoking. I don't drink caffeine and try to stay away from excess sugar. Anybody have any opinions?

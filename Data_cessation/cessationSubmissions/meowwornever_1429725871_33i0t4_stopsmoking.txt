had my last cigarette and signed up for a marathon yesterday!

I'm currently 21 hours without a cigarette (although 9 of those hours, I was sleeping). Any tips for what do do when the cravings get horrible? What about for driving in the car or after a really good meal?
 I have a phone app that shows me cigarettes not smoked, days without smoking, money saved, etc which is good motivation!

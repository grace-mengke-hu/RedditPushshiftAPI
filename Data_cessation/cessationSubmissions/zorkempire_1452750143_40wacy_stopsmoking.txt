After more than four years, I've had a slip. I don't want a reset...just some accountability.

At a Christmas party, I was tempted and took a few puffs on cigarettes of my coworkers. Since then I've done it more often and have even bummed entire cigarettes a few times in the past couple of weeks. It's like this dormant part of me woke up and started craving cigarettes again.

I hate cigarettes--the taste, the smell, the cost, the stigma--but apparently some part of me still craves them.
I don't think I need to reset my badge (unless the mods or whoever disagree), but I do want to post something so I'll have some accountability. I smoked a cigarette with a friend tonight, and afterwards I said that I couldn't keep playing this dangerous game with smoking. I don't want to continue on this path.

This community helped me a lot when I quit, so I'm trusting that it'll help me avoid this slippery slope I'm on. Thanks.

Nervous about moving in together

So my bf and I are seriously talking about moving in together. He doesn't smoke and I don't want to SMELL like smoke any longer, let alone jeopardize my health, etc. Right now it's easy. I just don't smoke before we get together, I brush my teeth a million times etc. I never smoke when I'm with him. Even on vacations, it's no big deal. And it's ok. I know I can smoke as soon as I feel like it after I get back home or in my car or whatever. But if we actually live together, I have to quit, and I'm getting panic attacks just thinking about it. No more escape. I enjoy my nightly cigarette before bedtime, in peace and quiet, and I'm so concerned that I might not be able to sleep, etc. I'll miss it and I know it's stupid. What to do? He knows/thinks that I smoke occasionally, and of course in reality it's more than just the occasional cigarette here and there. I'm a regular smoker. I need to quit. Help!

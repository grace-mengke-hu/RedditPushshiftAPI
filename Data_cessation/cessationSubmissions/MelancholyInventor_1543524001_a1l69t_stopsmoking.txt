Advice on how to maintain energy while quitting smoking

I no longer smoke cigarettes but have been on e-cigs for quite some time. I’m wondering how do you maintain energy throughout the day? This has been my biggest hurdle with e-cigs. I’m currently on prescription medication for other reasons and am not looking to add to my cocktail. Was wondering if there are any natural energy supplements/drinks that have worked for you. So far the only thing that works for me is physical activity. All advice welcome and thank you.

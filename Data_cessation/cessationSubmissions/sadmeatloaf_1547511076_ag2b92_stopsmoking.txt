How did you guys get started?

I want to stop smoking for health reasons. I've been smoking for about 6 years, I started when I was 15. I feel it is starting to greatly affect my health, mainly my heart. I don't have the best heart to begin with and I know smoking doesn't help, especially smoking a pack and half to a full one a day. I'm going to try and quit cold turkey. Would any of you guys have any advice?

Is this normal after quitting smoking?

I quit smoking cigarettes about four months ago and stopped using ecigs about two months ago. Smoked a pack a day for 15 years.  I thought it was easy sailing and didn't have any urges or any affects from stopping. 

After about three months I started to get this shortness of breath when talking or exercising. Then came the depression and anxiety. I've been clinching my jaw and waking up at 6 am every morning when my alarm is set for 8 am.

Is this normal? Anyone else experience something like this? I've gotten blood work done and 2 X-rays and went to two different doctors and both say I'm fine. 

I'm holding strong and not smoking, but it's hard when I'm feeling the worst I've ever felt in my entire life.

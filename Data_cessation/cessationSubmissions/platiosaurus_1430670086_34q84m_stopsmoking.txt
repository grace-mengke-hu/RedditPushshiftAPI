One week, pulling myself out of the frying pan

On friday my house threw an open mic/house party. I personally hate parties but it's a tradition as the house we live in has been passed down for a few college graduations, and it's nice to celebrate some of the creative people we know. 

Anyway, it was a poet's party so of course there was a ton of smoking everywhere, nowhere to escape it. I was doing pretty good most of the night, just getting progressively hammered and listening to people read. 

however at one point it got so bad i walked to the only open corner store to see if they had any non-nicotine e-cigs (wishful thinking). They didn't, only ones with nicotine. I just kept thinking how stupid it would be to put that chemical back in my system when i know it's been out since the third day.

So i didn't smoke, and i'm so fucking glad i didn't. I just wanted to share that because i wasn't really sure if i could make it out of that night without smoking, but i surprised myself. Best of luck to everyone, keep trucking towards tomorrow

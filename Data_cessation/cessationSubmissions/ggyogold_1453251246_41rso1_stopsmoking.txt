Lump in throat after quitting cold turkey for about 2 weeks

i've had this really bad lump in my throat for the past 2 weeks or so.

It seems to get progressively worse throughout the day and i feel the need to spit more often (like i've got a nasal drip or something like that) 

I also have alot of dairy in my diet which i'm guessing can't be helping

has anyone else experienced anything like this? is there anything you've found that helps?

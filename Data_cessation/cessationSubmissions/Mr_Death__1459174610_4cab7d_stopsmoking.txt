Just need a little help and support

Hi there, 
     I'm currently battling mild depression and I've been in therapy for a few months, it's working well so far. But for some reason, I've been smoking for the last 2 months after quitting back when I was 17. I'm now 24 coming up on 25 in August. I'm not sure why I've picked smoking back up in the last few months, for some reason I just find it calming, and for some reason, it's been helping with the, we'll call them Romantic Difficulties, I've been struggling with since last November. I've gone through 3 packs in the last 2 months, and I don't smoke every day, but the health risks are enough to scare the shit out of me and I'm hopefully on my last full pack right now. As I said, I don't smoke every day, but when I do it's usually 2 or 3 cigarettes. I'm in the middle of trying to turn my life around right now, I'm trying to cut down on my drinking and I'm in the process of eliminating junk food and fast food, all that wonderful stuff. But no matter how scared I am at the thought of cancer of any type, lighting up makes me feel alright. Just figured I'd post this hear for a little advice. 
Any help is greatly appreciated.

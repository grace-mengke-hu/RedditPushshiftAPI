Day 1

When my girlfriend crossed the finish line at the London Marathon yesterday, I threw what fags I had left, and my lighter straight in the bin. 

Due to a stupendous hangover I don't actually want a cigarette right now, but I am ready to watch my health improve, my bank balance improve, and my life improve.

Want to quit smoking.

I am 17 years old, smoking since i was 14.
start thanks to my friends, but its making me crazy, thinking about smoking and i think i already addicted. 
i feel so bad about it, my parents don't know that i am smoking, i always thinking about how should i smoke (waiting 'till they going to work etc.)
and in school ALL my friends smoking, if i could stop, its gonna be so hard hanging out with them.
what should i do? its didn't hurt my medical health and all of those stuff.

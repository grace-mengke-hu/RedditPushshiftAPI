First day!

I have been considering it for a long time and I am tired if cigarettes, I'm quitting! I believe in myself, I believe I can do it, and I will do it no matter how much pain there is, it is what I really want and no one forces me to do it, everyone who is with me, stay strong! People who quit cigarettes, I'm proud of you! People who tried to but failed, but are not giving up, I honor you. This subreddit has been REALLY inspiring for me and gave me a lot of hints, here's a thank you to the entire community!

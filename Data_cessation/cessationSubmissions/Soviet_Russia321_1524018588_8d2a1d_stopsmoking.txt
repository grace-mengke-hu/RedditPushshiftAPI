Quitting Social Smoking (Soliciting Advice)

Hello all,

Unlike some (most) of y'all, I am not traditionally (stereotypically?)addicted to nicotine, insofar as I can go weeks between cigarettes, only smoke 2-3 at most when I did smoke, and only smoked after plenty of drinks at a party.  That being said, any smoking is too much smoking.  After a pretty good stint for a few months of hanging out and going to parties while turning down cigarettes, I slipped up 10 days ago and smoked between 2 and 4 (I tend to ash early/get sick of my cigarette if it's my second or third in a row, so it's hard to get a hard number on how many "metric cigarettes" I smoked, so to speak).  That wasn't my brightest moment, obviously.  So I am committing myself to quitting social smoking here, hopefully so that it will motivate me to continue quitting.  

I am also wondering if y'all have any advice for someone like me.  I've been toying with a few ideas to cut down on cigarettes, barring the obvious "saying no".  E-cigarettes are the obvious choice, likely disposable ones, but I feel as though while harm is reduced, the underlying addiction to nicotine is still there and that's something I'd rather not foster.  Herbal cigarettes are something I've toyed with, specifically the green tea cigarettes, although these aren't fantastic.  I get sick of them fast and they can really burn in the inside of your mouth.  Yuck.  

My main problem stems from the fact that plenty of the people I know smoke socially, or more, so it is hard to avoid it in my circles.  Plus, there's something nice spending time on a porch at a party or while hanging out, and that inevitably invites cigarettes.  I know such problems may seem trivial, but if anyone here has had a similar problem and found a novel solution, I'm game.

Please give me some advice how to quit.

Hi, I joined here but I have been on reddit for years without account, and then I found this sub. My english isn't very good, but I really need help about quiting, so... 
I have two cigarettes left, and I want to quit after them. 
I've been moking for year and a half now, half pack a day, and hiding it from my familly and friends. I had my first cig. two years ago, and since then been wanting them and dreaming them till I finally started smoking. The longest I was without them as for 8 days since then. I think my mom knows I smoke but she is a smoker too, and she doesn't care, my dad acts like he doesn't know, friends are smokers or on't want to tell me to stop, cause it is my choice. The only erson who probabbly cares is my sister, but she doesn't knw and I think it would rip her heart out if she finds out cause i lied her i didn't smoke and she hates cigaretts. I am a 20yo female, and I am going to stop doing this and i need someone to help me cause I have very week personality. 
The worst part is deffinitely shking and feeling in my stomach after few days without them. I imagine how i hold them and light them and i do the patter with my fingers all the time.

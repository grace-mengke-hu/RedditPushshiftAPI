Came down with an awful head cold, used it as some extra motivation to try to quit (again)

I've had one cigarette this week, four days ago.

Edit: I'm not american, so they days are wonky.

At the start of the year I quit for three months, then somewhere in the middle I quit again for two months and various week or so attempts. While I am not completely happy, this is the year I've smoked the least out of the last six, so that's something. 

I feel like I'm breaking the routine habits like having a cigarette with a coffee or smoking to counteract an overfull stomach because that's not the way I always do it any more. I still do these things sometimes, but it's not a compulsion like it used to be.

It's easy to forget to buy or bring my cigarettes with me now, I don't keep them in my bag, I keep them in my drawer and I generally don't buy another pack when I do, I just wait it out.

Pretty sure this is my year. I'll just keep seeing it as a game "how long can I go without a cigarette" and try to beat my highscore.

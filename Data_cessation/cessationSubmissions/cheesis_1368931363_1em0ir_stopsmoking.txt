Didn't get any smoke breaks at work today...

Felt great! About 90% of the people I work with smoke including that pregnant girl... they looked at me like I was crazy when I told them I quit. Doing my job is a lot easier without constantly worrying about when my next cigarette will be. 

Anyway... yay!

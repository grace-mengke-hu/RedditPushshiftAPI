I just donated half of what I've saved not smoking to charity.

No matter your financial situation, if you're a smoker and quit, you can do this too if you want.  For me, I have a lot of debt, but it felt really great to give back as a reward for quitting, and knowing that the money I would have otherwise burned up to kill myself will be spent for suicide prevention.  It was just a thought that I wanted to share to everyone, maybe for a feel good pick-me-up if you're in the depressed phase, or even after.  Our charities need money, and our communities need help, always.  Giving back, instead of feeding an addiction feels wonderful.

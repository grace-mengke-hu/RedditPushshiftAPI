Just quit! Halloween 2014 ftw! Good riddance!

Its been a long time, my old friend.. and it continues. 

i see a new light at the end of the tunnel. now I'm between the repeat of smoke after smoke. I will forge ahead and temper my willpower along the way. the rationale of killing oneself for a brief and rare euphoria is no longer viable. I realize the weight of the filth I introduce. life's too short. 

It will make me sad to have lost you, but I will take strength from our divorce and change the habit forever.

Good riddance


UPDATE: I resumed smoking but I took a 24 hour period off. I resumed my habits by compulsively getting a pack.. Starting over after this pack which should be tomorrow night.

One Year.

I never thought I'd make it. I smoked for 15 years, a pack to two packs a day. I tried quitting a lot of different ways several different times and it is finally really working. I once quit for six months and fucked it up and I never though I'd get here, but I don't think about it. I don't want them. 

Allen Carr didn't do it for me, nor e-cigs, nor the gum or the patch or cold turkey. I worked with a cognitive behavioral group to deal with my anxiety and that, of all things, is what finally did it. What works for everyone will probably be different, but what is important is that you don't give up. Keep trying. If my lazy ass can do it, so can you. We all just might need to stumble and fail a little on our way.

Wow, in 40 hours since I quit smoking my resting heart rate went from 88bpm to 67bpm

It's been 40 hours since I quit. One thing I've noticed is my heartrate has improved dramatically.

I have noticed in the past when I quit my heart rate drops, but it's been so long since I quit that I forgot how good this feels. I exercise regular even when I was smoking and could never understand why my resting heart rate wasn't improving. Or why my heart rate would sky rocket during exercise.

Both my resting heart rate, and the heart rate during exercise, have both improved already.

This makes me never want to smoke again. Anyone else notice this?

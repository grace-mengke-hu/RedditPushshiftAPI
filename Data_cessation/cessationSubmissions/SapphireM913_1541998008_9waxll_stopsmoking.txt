3 Months can stop anytime now...

11/1 was my 3 month mark. I know, 3 days, 3 weeks, 3 months, these are the rough points. It's held true so far, but for fucks sake, I just want to get through this last hurdle so I can move on with my life. I'm too damn busy to get caught up in the emotions of quitting again. Cravings, I drove past an OLD gas station I used to buy cigarettes at and turned on my signal, and then went "wtf are you doing?" And drove past. I smell it in my car through the vents when other cars are smoking and it smells devine. I actually had a craving that lasted a whole 30 minutes last week, to the point where I reached out to a friend for support. They asked how bad it was and my response was "it's FUCK THIS NOISE bad!" Irritability is back, not nearly as bad as I know it can be, but like... Come on! Just... Just... STAHP. STAAAHHHHHHP.

Today is day one.

Today the my second try at day one. I ran out of smokes night before last, and just decided to quit. I made it most of the day, but caved and bought a pack at the first store I passed on the way to work last night. 

About two hours ago, I crushed the remainder of that pack and said "No More." I'm done with it. I am 41 years old, and have been smoking two packs a day for 23 years.  Wish me luck.

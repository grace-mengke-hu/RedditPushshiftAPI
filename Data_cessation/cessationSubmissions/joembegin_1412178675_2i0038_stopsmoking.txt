Dilema

I really want to quit.

I think I realized the extent of smoking's damage when I went hiking this summer and my lung capacity was so bad I literally barely made a hike that was easy to some people in my group.

I don't want to hurt myself anymore; I feel like to have a stable and healthy life I need a stable and healthy body. Plus this is the only body I get, I have to treat it with the most respect and care that I can.

But I've been smoking for 3 years now, since I was 14, and it's become such a vital part of my life: the buzz from that first cigarette in the morning, relaxing with a cup of coffee and a couple cigarettes after school, smoking at 2 in the morning when I'm stressed and can't sleep. I don't really remember what life was like before smoking.

I can't even begin to try and quit because I cannot picture my life without it! I don't even know WHO I am without smoking.

How do I break free from this mental addiction? How did it work for you guys whose psychological addiction was stronger than the chemical one?

I don't know what I'm supposed to do.

4 weeks in and weird dreams the past week

Finally 4 weeks in. The past week, I've been having weird dreams with similar theme. This past week I'm also on my pot t break. It might coincide with that, but who knows.

My dreams has revolved around forgetting that I'm quitting cigarettes and I took a puff. Right after that, I'd feel guilty and scared of the relapse. Then I'd wake up both scared and feeling that all my effort past 4 weeks are wasted.

Anyone with smoking dream?

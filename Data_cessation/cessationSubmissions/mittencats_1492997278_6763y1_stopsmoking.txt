Fell off the bandwagon, then got run over with it. Any tips for the daily habits?

So, I've wanted to quit for a while, but my will power isn't the best. I finally just got sick of it and quit completely. Lasted only 3 days, then my ex came home (still live together, long story) and he's a heavy smoker so.... yeah willpower defeated. Giving it another go but this time I'm finding it harder, things that are force of habit mainly, rather than the actual cigarette e.g. wake up, make coffee, cigarette. Go to work, roll one for the journey. Walk to work, sit down for a cigarette on the way etc. I have been doing this for 11 years, so I was wondering if anyone has any tips to beat these ingrained habits? Note: Vaping with nicotine is illegal here

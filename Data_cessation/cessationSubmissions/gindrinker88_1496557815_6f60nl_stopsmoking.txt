If you are thinking of using a vape to quit...

I just felt I should post here as I get a bit annoyed seeing people commenting on other people's posts that vaping is cheating and any type of nicotine replacement means they are not a real quitter etc!
I tried quite a few times to quit smoking but call it lack of willpower or whatever you like but I just couldn't do it. I then started looking on this site, most people are ridiculously helpful and lovely and have made my journey amazing! I happened to notice someone mention a vape. So 12 weeks ago I invested in one, started on a 12mg nicotine liquid and weaned myself down onto a 0mg within 4 weeks which I stayed on for a few weeks then I set my badge on here and my stop smoking app and was completely free, can't see my days while I am writing but think it's about 6 weeks since I gave up the vape. Will be nice to see it on here actually!
I am not trying to recommend vaping to someone or to try and sound patronising BUT EVERYONE'S JOURNEY IS DIFFERENT!!! Quitting smoking is bloody hard and if you want to quit with a vape or lozenges or gum then that's what you should do, it doesn't mean your quit is any less amazing! So yeah just a quick positive story for you, oh and I have no desire to smoke and I didn't while I was vaping so for all the people who say that vapers go back to smoking, this is my longest quit and my vape is gone! Good luck quitters!!!

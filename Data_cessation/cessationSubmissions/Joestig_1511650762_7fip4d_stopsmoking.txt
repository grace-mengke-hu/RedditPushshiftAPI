8 days I quit smoking at the worst moment - and I made it! :P

You sometimes hear people say that you should quit when it's the *right time* - when you don't have a lot on your mind and you have the necessary time and energy.

Well, I don't know what I think of that. It could be an excuse, but it also makes sense.

No matter if that's right or not, I know one thing for sure: I quit at the worst moment ever! I quit 8 days ago, and at that time I had an extremely important deadline at work that was very near and a lot of complicated work needed to happen (that I never did before so I wasn't sure if I could do it), so gave me a lot of stress. I even pulled an all nighter to make sure that I'd make it, and I did. Smoking is my crutch under those circumstances, and I refused to take it. Perhaps quitting smoking at that time actually helped me, because I denied myself one option of fleeing from the situation and I chose to fight.

Fortunately, I made it, and it was an intense week for sure. Now I have proven that I am capable of overcoming difficulty, and that I don't need any crutches for that. So, the smoking is out for sure! I have a good life to build!

I don't mean to brag. I am just surprised that this is possible. I turns some assumptions that I always had and mentioned in this post (that you *need* smoking for something, and that you should wait for a *right time* to quit) on it's head. I find that interesting, and I am curious what your thoughts are about this.

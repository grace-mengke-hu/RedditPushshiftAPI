Halfway through day one (...again) on the lozenges, doing well so far!

I woke up and popped one before I even got out of bed.  I spent all morning reading r/stopsmoking, got my motivation up!  I bought a pack of smokes on the way in to work, but only to give to the guy I've been bumming them from as repayment.  Didn't smoke at work, didn't smoke when I got home (another big trigger)...  I feel like I've gotten my brain in the right zone to get it done this time, and will be requesting my badge again tomorrow!  Wish me luck, and thank you guys for sharing, it's an inspiration and motivation to read your stories.  See you soon!

1 year and counting. Thanks everyone. This sub helped

Guys... I started smoking 11 years ago.  I got up to near 2 packs a day. 1 year ago I made the decision to quit this nasty habbit.  It was some of the hardest days.  And it was compounded when I was deployed and the stress was killer. But you all gave me so much positivity.  I just wanted to say thanks, and you guys can do it too!

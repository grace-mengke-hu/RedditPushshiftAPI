i've decided today to stop! i'm ready to join the family here

Hey everyone. Sorry, I know there's probably hundreds of these posts but I just discovered this subreddit. 

I've been thinking about stopping for quite some time and I've decided today is the day I start the process. I've been a smoker for about 4 years. I know that's not a long time compared to a lot of people here, but it's too long for me. (I started a new account because I don't want people who know me to know that I smoke, it's been a secret.) I'm gonna try and cold-turkey this and change up some routines so that I don't have the craving as badly. If there's any advice y'all can give me I'd appreciate it!

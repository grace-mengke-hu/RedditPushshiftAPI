Desperate to quit, but seemingly unable

Hi all, 

Been reading this sub the past week or so - really inspirational reading the stories, challenges and successes of so many!

I've been smoking on and off for the past 15/16 years. Been smoking hard (2-3 packs a day) for the past 4 years. 

The thing is is that I hate it - I'm not one of those "wow smoking is great!" smokers - I hate the time it steals, the stink, the fact that I'm literally killing myself (a lot and quickly given how much I smoke). I have smoked my "last smoke" more than 20 times this year - 5 times this month.

The challenge is not that I have big hairy cravings, but it's a very quiet, "rational", internal voice that says "hey, just one more box..." or "you want to do this, but maybe not now..." that gets louder as the day progresses - I get to hour 6 - 18 and the voice wins out. Every time. 

I've read Allan Carr - it makes sense and I get it. I've read the whyquit.com book - agree that I'm a nicotine junkie and the junkie mind is the one controlling the little voice in my head. I'm sold. But I still can't last even one day.

The simple answer is I obviously don't want to quit badly enough - but I really, really do - so how the hell is it even possible that despite occupying my thoughts non stop and making me feel like crap constantly I don't really want to get rid of this thing? It doesn't make sense. :(

Anyways - I want to quit again, and this time do it properly - fight the first 24 hours, and then the next.

Apologies that this post isn't super inspirational - but have any of you experienced something similar? And if so, how did you eventually overcome it?

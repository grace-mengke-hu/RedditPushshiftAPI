Day .5

I had my last cigarette at 3:45 this afternoon. I'm using the app Smoke Free, and it's helping a lot. It shows how long you've gone, how many cravings you've overcome (you log them), your health progress, how much money you've saved, and a couple of other things. I really really want to quit this time. The last time I did, it was a year and a half. I was pregnant for 9 months of that, swore that I wouldn't start again, and then it was "I'll only smoke at work", and then it turned into a little over a quarter pack a day. Never around my child, but it's on my clothes. I wash my hands so much that my skin is raw underneath my ring.

I work in a hospital and see people hooked up to IVs, still smoking. I don't want to be that person. None of us do. I have one guy who I talk to with a hole in his throat. So many people on oxygen. 

The thing that I'm struggling with is what to do on breaks now. My mind is so used to the set times of when I go on break and smoke. I don't want to eat every time. I'm thinking about taking the elevator to the top floor, and taking the steps all the way down. It would probably take me 15 minutes, anyway. Also, when I get a bad craving, I think it would be a good idea to do some squats or sit ups until it passes. It may help with the weight gain. Last night I ate a bowl of cereal and then a pb&j...after dinner, instead of smoking. I need to do something else.

60 hours and almost beyond the hill - how did it feel for you?

Hi everyone, I'm at 60 hours now (my partner and I both had our last cigarette Saturday) and I'm curious when it started to feel physically and emotionally better for anyone who quit cold turkey. In the past I've found using an e-cig only prolongs my quitting and even sometimes encourages me to smoke, since I'm not necessarily putting away the behavioral aspect of smoking. We were so irritable Sunday and yesterday, but last night I got a solid 9 hours of sleep and now I feel really positive. Physically, I'm craving a cigarette and my chest feels tight. But emotionally I'm feeling strong, I don't know the last time I went nearly three full days without a stupid cigarette. What's it like from here on out? Am I being naive thinking I'm almost past the hurdle? I just want to the moodiness to go away, my partner's been particularly grumpy and it's a bit frustrating, I just feel like we should be as positive as possible but I guess I have to manage expectations..

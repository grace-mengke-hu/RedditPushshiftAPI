Second Week

Has anybody else found it to be harder after 7 days instead of easier? I didn’t necessarily think it would be a breeze but I did think that by day 7 I had gone through the worst of it. I keep reminding myself that it will get easier over time. I trust that. I am right now having to be extra vigilant. It’s funny. It’s not even just that stress is making me want to smoke. It’s almost like I’m causing the stress in the first place to have an excuse to smoke (start argument, get upset about argument, brain tells me I should just have one cigarette so I can calm down after argument). Every now and then I will absentmindedly imagine the way it feels in my throat when I would take a drag. Like I’m trying to convince myself I actually did enjoy smoking. Anyway, I guess there’s not really a point to this post other than wanting to get things off my chest. Stay strong, everyone.

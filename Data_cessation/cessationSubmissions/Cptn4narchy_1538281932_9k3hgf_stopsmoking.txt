Cessation Help

Hello. I'm interested in quitting smoking but am having a little trouble finding something to assist with it. I've tried Chantix, which just gave me horrendous headaches. The patches seem to offer no help, possibly bc I smoke 20-30 cigarettes a day. The gum I found vile since I can taste the nicotine. Granted, when I was young i attempted suicide by rendering pure nicotine, so I may be sensitive to that taste. Are there any other options you guys know about or am I just left with willpower as my only option?

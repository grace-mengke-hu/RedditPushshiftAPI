The coughing continues

So I haven't had a cigarette in a week and my breathing feels better already. This week of success is due in large part to the support of this community. Thank you guys so much!

I've been coughing a lot and clearing a lot of crap from my lungs. Now I have a crackling sound and sensation in the lower lobe of my right lung. I'm scared that it might be something more serious. I don't have a fever or any other associated symptoms. I guess it's just anxiety. 

Has anyone else dealt with this? Should I seek medical help or will it resolve as my lungs heal?

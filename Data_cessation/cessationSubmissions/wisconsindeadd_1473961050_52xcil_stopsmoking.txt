1,000 Cravings Later...

**I hit One Year!**

* 5,000 Cigarettes avoided
* $1,750 Saved

I started at 14 and smoked until 27. I really loved cigarettes but it became so obviously pointless. I had felt guilty about smoking for a number of years prior to quitting, and that wore on me. Though my big moments really came about last summer during a few concerts and weddings where I just felt like shit. My heart was pounding, my chest ached, my blood circulation was horrible. I was in the worst shape of my life when I should've been at my peak. I'd be craving a cigarette and look down to see one burning in my hand. Even a cigarette couldn't cure my incessant cravings. It was so pointless. My heart and chest feel so much better. I used to have daily pains and they are 99% gone now that I've quit. I quit smoking because I could feel it killing me everyday. I also quit because I wanted the cravings to finally end and they pretty much have. I still have my moments but its nothing like it was during the first month. All of the romanticizing of smoking goes away. Everything that was great with a cigarette is just as good without them once you break through the major part of your addiction. I'm really proud and really relieved this bullshit is over. If you really want to quit smoking, you can do it. *Put in the time, deal with the pain and MAN UP.* It's worth it. Cheers yall.

OMG...cigarette smoke smells so bad!!!!!

So I went out grocery shopping today and when I got back to my apt building someone had smoked in the lobby area, which is where the mailboxes are located, and people are NOT to smoke.  While I was checking my mail and even more so when I went to unlock the door, it really came to me just how bad cigarette smoke smells.  I was so glad to get back into my apartment, where thanks to 5 days of not smoking, smells so good these days. :)

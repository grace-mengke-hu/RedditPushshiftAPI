12 hours in

Bahhhhh.  I have quit smoking for years at a time only to pick it again few months ago and just cannot kick it this time. I started smoking 21 years ago, quit when I was pregnant with my oldest, started again when he was a few months old, quit again for my second pregnancy and was able to keep that up until he was 3. 

This has been the hardest time I have had quitting. My husband smokes too and keeps saying he is going to quit with me but keeps buying that "last pack". 

I know some of my motivation to quit is getting that break from everything for a few minutes of smoking (we don't smoke indoors). 

I really want a cigarette this morning!!!

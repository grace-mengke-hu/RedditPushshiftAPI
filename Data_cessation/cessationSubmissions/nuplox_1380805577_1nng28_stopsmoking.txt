Trying something a little different this time around.

I've done a bit of research on e-cigs and I know their usage for smoking cessation is controversial, both IRL and on this sub reddit.
But I am going to give them a shot. I never seem to get past the 48 hour mark in the past with cold turkey. While yes, I know it's mind over matter in a lot of ways, and it's not supposed to be easy, but I need to quit. And now is as good a time as any.

Had my last traditional cigarette at 10:30 pm last night. So it's about 9.5 hours into "day one". 

Does anyone have suggestions for quit smoking apps that account for these sorts of nicotine "replacements"?

Never thought I could do it.

I decided to use an app to help me "visualize" my process... but I just felt dumb using it. But one of the things it told me I should try to do is to join this subreddit.

Anyways, I've been smoking since I was 12, so I've spent more of my life smoking then not. This has been the hardest thing for me to do because I would smoke after and or during everything I did. anyways... I quit for my Daughter and used the the patch. Today is Day 3 without the patch.. this is really hard.

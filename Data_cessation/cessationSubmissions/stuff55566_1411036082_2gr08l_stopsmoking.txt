Does quitting get any easier? (One Month)

I've been smoke free for one month now. Exactly one month to the day I started using the patch for nicotine replacement and Zyban for thew mood swings. I've stopped taking the Zyban entirely because my mood doesnt shift as badly anymore, but I still am on the 21 mg patch for another two weeks. I'm really happy that I've managed to make it this far without smoking but every day I can't help but roll out of bed and want a cigarette. When I'm done eating, I want a cigarette. When I drive to/from work. Cigarette.

I'm just asking some of you experienced non-smokers out there. What did you do to make it easier?

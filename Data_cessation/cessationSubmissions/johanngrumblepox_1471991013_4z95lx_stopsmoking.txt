day 0 (for the 500th time)

Okay, I'm back, humbly, quitting again.  

This time I have set up some strategies for success:

- work from home for the next three days.  I share an office with people with whom I smoke during the day.  I've told them that I'm quitting and spending the next 3 days holed up in my house.  Like when I quit drinking, I'm making this quit my top priority for the next three days and taking action to keep myself safe.
- I've reset my badge.
- I've installed QuitNow which I used last year when I was smoke-free for about 8 months.
- I changed my desktop wallpaper to a reminder (which seemed to work when I was smoke-free for 2 years about 10 years ago)
- I've put stickies up on my bathroom mirror and around my house. 

I tend to get in most trouble during transitional times of the day - between work and after-work plans, between crossfit and starting work, etc.  So, I'm still trying to figure out how to set myself up for success during those times, but the best I can figure out is just to hole up for a bit. 

The good news is that after this week, I'm going on vacation with non-smokers, and then to a work conference where I wouldn't normally smoke (work networking/political stuff).  

So, here goes nothing.  Really wanting it to stick this time.  I'm so sick of being a slave to this addiction.

Perfect snooker break

Just stopped by to read a few posts and check on my own number and I see that I have the perfect snooker break score, 147.  Having never played the game in my life, this seems like a really random connection to make and fact to know.  Still, I am liking this number! Hope everyone is having a great smoke free day.

Two weeks of not smoking - let's continue for 70+ more years!

You know, it's actually not hard at all. At least not anymore. It was in the start, but right now, I have very little cravings. Even if it were challenging, then it would still be worth it to me. Without a doubt. My lungs are getting better, I can breathe more easily already. I can feel they need more time to heal, but that only reminds me *not* to smoke, because that would only make it worse. I am exercising more regularly now, because I have shifted my mindset from stupidly *destroying* my health to *building* it up. I look forward to seeing where I may end up.

I have planned my first triathlon at the end of this month, and I will do a rock climbing weekend in 10 days. This is what I can do with a strong body. I hope to keep living the life I want to live for 70+ years!

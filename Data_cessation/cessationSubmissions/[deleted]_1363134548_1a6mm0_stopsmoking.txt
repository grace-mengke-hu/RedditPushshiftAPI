Today, first day of quitting. 5 hours 17 minutes since final cigarette.

As the title says, I quit today at around 12pm. I smoked 1.5 packs a day (30ish cigarettes). I have done this for about 14 years, and my chest feels like it's going to cave in. 

I have been doing the "Ok, this is the last pack" thing since early January, and finally convinced myself it was time. 

I don't have a smart phone, so I don't get to have one of those cool apps that tells me I haven't smoked so and so many cigarettes for so and so many days. 

I quit before several times. Once I quit for a whole 8 months. 

My reasons are:
Health
Smell
Money

I will be saving around $3,300 a year, about 8.50 - 9.00 a day. 

I will be able to do my work faster and with out getting as fatigued so easily. 

I wont smell like cigarettes.

See you guys on the other side of detox.

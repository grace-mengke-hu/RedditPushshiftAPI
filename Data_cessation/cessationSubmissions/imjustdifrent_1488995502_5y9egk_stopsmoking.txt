A little over two weeks in... when does the anger stop?

I am on Day 17 without cigarettes. I'm using the nicotine patches, and I've noticed that I'm not so much irritable as I am irate. Little stuff that I used to be able to just ignore or take a deep breath and get over now has me flipping out and in a huge rage.

I remember going through this in the past. I started smoking when I was 17, quit cold turkey a few months later, and when my mom attempted to punish me for something, I picked her up off the ground and pinned her against a wall. As soon as I realized what was happening, I dropped her and walked away. I went back to smoking once I turned 18.

When I was 21, I went on Chantix. I never craved a cigarette, but one of the toddlers I was babysitting was going through a licking phase. He tried to lick me and I almost punched him. I caught myself, but it scared me enough to go back to smoking.

The last time was age 25. I tried the vape, and while I don't remember most of what happened, I do remember snapping and shouting at my then-boyfriend's 4yo son. My boyfriend and I argued later that night, and he encouraged me to go back to smoking.

Now I'm 28. Any time I bring it up, people tell me I should smoke. "You're clearly the type who NEEDS cigarettes," is something I've heard a lot. But I don't want to smoke. I'm addicted, but I want to quit and be successful at quitting.

But I also don't want to be the type who freaks out at the slightest inconvenience. It scares the shit out of me to think I might have to go back to smoking just to maintain friendships, or that quitting might mean agreeing to never have kids of my own just so I don't end up an abusive fuckwad to them. 

So my questions to y'all are... has anybody else gone through this, where you aren't just irritable but raging over the littlest things? What do you do to calm yourself down? Does it ever end or get easier? Please help!

Dealing with the drive home from work?

Help. I finished Allen Carr's book the other night, and I still had half a pack left. Foolishly, I brought it to work with me. I was fine all day, then I hit rush hour traffic on my way home. I smoked. And then I smoked two more. I threw away the rest of the pack, and made it through work just fine today. Then I again hit rush hour and had a 40+ minute drive home. I lost it and stopped and bought more cigarettes. When traffic is clear, my drive home is less than 20 minutes, but on the worst days it takes 40-60 minutes, and it's aggravating. I know that smoking does not make the drive shorter. I try to apply the positive thinking and realize that the feeling will pass, but on my drive home, it comes back within minutes. I talk myself down, and then it's back.

It doesn't help that today was a warm day and heated up the lovely cigarette stink in my car. Half of me was like, "Gross; at least you're on your way to eliminating that stink forever," but the over half was like, "OMG, I can smell cigarettes, give me one NOW." And I'm trapped in my car, in traffic, with nothing to distract me. I want to quit. I know I don't truly enjoy cigarettes. 

Does anyone have any advice on dealing with not smoking during the commute? I don't know. I know the book says not to cut back, but like I said, I'm fine during the day, it's the commute home where I crumble. Maybe I should just keep going as I am until the weekend and quit completely on a day when I don't have to face rush hour?

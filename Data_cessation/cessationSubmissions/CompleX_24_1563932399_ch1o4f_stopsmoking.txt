Does nicotine trigger depersonalization/derealization?

I quit smoking weed about 2 weeks ago,mostly because of derealization symptoms.
 Although they were slowly dissipating,today I lighted up a cig and i felt dr symptoms way more intense than usual.
Is it possible that these two have some kind of connection?

Health benefits for quitting smoking

Hello! I have quit for 30 days now! I am so incredibly proud of myself and I am so thankful for getting to this point after 13 years of CONSTANTLY trying to quit and never lasting more than a week.

I have smoked the odd cigarette when drinking but otherwise I am good and never really crave cigarettes unless I'm around my "usual smoking haunts" like when my roomate has her after work cigarette that used to *our* after work cigarette. OR when I can't sleep that groggy middle of the night i'm-the-only-person-awake-in-the-whole-world cigarette that calms my nerves so i can sleep again. 

I used one of those fake strawberry flavoured "cigarettes" from the corner store for most of my cravings and it's been fine.

I am excited about my asthma maybe calming down and also my skin improving.

Is there any app or website that lists what the health benefits are as you go? I have tried looking this up myself with little luck.

Basically it would be cool to be like "well i'm on day 36 of quitting and now my lungs are starting to repair themselves" which would motivate me to continue not smoking when I feel like giving up.

Thanks! :) and Congrats to all of you who have done it and feel free to talk to me if you haven't yet or are struggling I love talking about it but never have anyone to talk to!

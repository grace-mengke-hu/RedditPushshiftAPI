Back from Amsterdam. That was hard!

I visited amsterdam with my husband (Heavy Smoker) and our friend (Heavy Smoker no. 2). Both of them smoked pack after pack of lucky strike, and visited several coffee shops. I had a wonderful time but man, not smoking was so hard.
I visited amsterdam 10 years ago and back then I used to smoke pot and was still a cigarette smoker, and visiting the city again while free of nicotine and THC is a different, albeit better experience. 

But the good news - I didn't smoke! No weed, no cigarettes! I had a very hard time after heavy meals (This is the hardest time day to day as well - If you have tips, I'd love to know), but I made it!

Yay!!!

Quick smoking and feeling sick, connected?

So I quit smoking 4 weeks ago today, cold turkey, been smoking for around 10 years.

I quit smoking because I was able to 'take advantage' of a bout of food poisoning, couldn't even bear the thought of smoking for a couple days and decided to get it going.

Got better from the food related issues, but then my nausea and bloating and generally feeling awful in the stomach and digestive departments got so much worse! I've now got awful headaches and backaches and terrible acid reflux.

The same thing happened when I quit last time (for around a year), just wanted to see if anyone else had a similar experience and if they could share their war stories?

Stopped smoking on my birthday (April 1st), doing well!

Hey guys, I stopped smoking 3 weeks ago, this is my 3rd time trying, but my first time really not seeing any excuses for me to start again. This is also the first time I quit with the knowledge of this subreddit! So many good advice here!

Edit: Some more info, I've been smoking for a couple years now, started around 18 or 19 years old and I'm 25 now.

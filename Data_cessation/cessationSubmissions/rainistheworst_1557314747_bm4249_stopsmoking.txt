i'm losing my mind quitting

Ok so lately i have been living with a couple of cigarettes per week and now i ran out and can't get any more (underaged). I also have no money to keep my addiction going on and the 2-3 cigarettes lifestyle wasn't even too bad i think health-wise?? 

I've now been about a week without any and i'm losing my fuckin mind. I'm shaky all the time and nothing makes me forget the urges. Aghghhgh. I have been thinking about quitting because it's so hard to get some and i got a job at a place that's smoke free. I have been smoking for almost a year and shit's tough. Anyone else having A LOT of trouble? Suggestions? Anything.

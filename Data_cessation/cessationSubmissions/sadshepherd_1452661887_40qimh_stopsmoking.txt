I don't feel very well. Boohoo.

Aches and pains, swollen glands, a heaviness/stickiness around my chest, lethargy, occasional nausea, raised levels of self-pity. I understand you're not doctors but is this a normal quitters sickness or is it unrelated (based on your experiences). 

Otherwise I'm doing alright, two weeks tomorrow, hoorah. Any other NYE quitters feeling unwell? How's it going?

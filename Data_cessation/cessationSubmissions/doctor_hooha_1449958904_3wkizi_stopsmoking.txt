Dreading this, but here we go...

I'm not going to make this super long, but I was just accepted to nursing school and I feel so guilty every time I'm chatting with someone with a cigarette in my hand and it comes up.  I started pretty young so it's been going on too long.  I'm hoping that posting here keeps me accountable.  Wish me luck.

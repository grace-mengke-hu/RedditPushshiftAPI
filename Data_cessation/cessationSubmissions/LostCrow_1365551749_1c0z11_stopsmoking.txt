My progress so far..

On February 16th I decided to start going to the gym again.  Since I have been in college, I stopped going out of pure laziness, but I have a friend who is a big workout fiend, and he is obsessed with going to the gym.  Before we began our workout, we warm up everyday with 20 minutes of cardio.  This absolutely killed me.  I was light-headed, I couldn't breath, I just wanted to die.  I decided my next step was to start eating healthier.

See, I'm not a big guy.  I weigh 130 pounds at 5'7", but I ate fast food three times a day and drank 5-6 cokes a day.  I knew that this would catch up with me one day, and with my working out everyday, I decided I needed to cut out fast food as well and start cooking my meals for myself.  

March 16th, I was drinking with a friend of mine. (even though I have cut out fast food and coke, I still have a cheat day once a week and I drink with some friends)  In my complete drunken state, I decided that since I have gone healthier that I was going to quit smoking once and for all.  I have been smoking for 7 years, but I decided now was enough!  My friend didn't believe me.  I have made this proclamation time and time again.  So I gave him my smokes and decided no more.


So that brings me to today. I am on day 24 of quitting smoking.  I haven't had a coke in almost 2 months.  While I have not lost any weight, because I had no weight to lose, I have put on a lot of muscle, a noticeable amount.  But today was the really amazing part. I decided after work, to go running with my dog.  Last time I tried this, about 3 months ago, I nearly died and made it half a mile.  Well today we made it 2 miles, non-stop jogging, and only stopped because she looked beat and was ready to call it a day.  I would never of dreamed being able to do this again.  And on top of that, no cravings anymore.  I made working out and being healthy my addiction and when I wanted a smoke, I grabbed an apple instead.  I feel amazing.

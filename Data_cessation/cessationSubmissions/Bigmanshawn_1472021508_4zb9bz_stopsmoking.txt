Holy Crap 691 Days

Just wanted to check back in because I just came to look out of curiosity and had no idea just how long it had been since I quit smoking.  

For those of you wanting to know or curious about it I still think about cigarettes, occasionally crave one but I can stand with smokers without an issue and really have 0 interest in them anymore.  

I can breath so much better, I don't hack and cough at all anymore.  Fresh air feels fresh and I dont stink like some kind of disgusting chemical shit pile (Yes you smell like that, you have no idea just how bad you smell till you quit)

Weight really stayed the same through most of it, maybe put on a couple pounds here and there.  I get so much more done now because my mind is not consumed with the need to figure out when I can get my next nicotine fix.   My body heals quicker, works better and everything in life is generally better.

Since I quit smoking, I fell in love, got engaged to be married and turned my entire life around in a possitive way.  Smoking is such a wedge in your ability to make positive change that everything can cascade after you finally get rid of it into good things.  (your milage may vary of course).

Anyways 691 days and feeling fantastic.

I stopped last night. This is it.

c.10 years and I'm done now. At a time in life when I'm not sure which decisions I make are right, but there is absolutely no question that the decision to give up cigarettes is 100% right. How fantastic.

I have nothing to lose and everything to gain.

I'm not suffering, and I refuse to suffer. I'm excited. The smoking part of my life is over! What a relief.

Good luck gang. This sub is inspirational.

I have given up but girlfriend hasn't....

... and when I'm working or at my house I can get through the days with ease. As soon as I go to hers or out with her I just want to smoke as she is anyway. Her choice of course and so I won't make her stop. 
This has been going on for a few weeks now and I was giving in but I have to stop. 
Preferably without us having to break up!!

Any advise on how to cope with a partner who smokes when trying to give up.

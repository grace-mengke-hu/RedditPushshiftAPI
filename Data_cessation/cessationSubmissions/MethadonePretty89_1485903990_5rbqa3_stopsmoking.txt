Great tip! Baby food jar with 2 butts and water. Im sure its already been posted here, but I wanted to mention it again.

14 year smoker. I've tries many times to quit, and am trying to quit again. One of the most helpful things for me during my last attempt, was to put 2 smoked butts, in a baby food jar, with water; every time you want a smoke, open the jar, and smell it. You will want to vomit, and a smoke will be the last thing you want!! Good luck!

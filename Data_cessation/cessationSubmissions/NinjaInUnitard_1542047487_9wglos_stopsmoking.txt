Dealing with stress

Hey. I've been smoke free for over 4 months now. But recently my life got a lot more stressful and I don't know how to cope. I tried exercising and crying, and eating, and drinking...

I've smoked for such a long time, I never actually learned how to deal with short but intense stress episodes.

Advice, please?

Day 11 - Been a few days, but made it through

A lot of people who quit say they gain weight. I know I can't afford to do that, so maybe that's why in the back of my mind I decided the C25k was what I needed to do during this process. I weighed myself and I was about 246lbs. (I am 6'1")

Been a few rough patches. Yesterday I had to do two jogs. One in the morning and one at night. Total of about 35 minutes of walking/jogging and I didn't work Sunday/Monday/Tuesday this week. So It's Wednesday now, and I get to work and weigh myself.

I am happy to say that after 11 days of no smoking, my legs are killing me, and I am under 230lbs. 16lbs in 11 days is pretty good IMO.

I actually feel better when I wake up in the mornings now. I get a craving sure, but I feel more alert. I think it's the sleeping that's doing it. I have never slept so good, than when I go jogging for 15-20 minutes at night before bed. It's crazy.

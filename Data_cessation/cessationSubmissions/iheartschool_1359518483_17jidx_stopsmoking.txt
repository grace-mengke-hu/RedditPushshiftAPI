7 days smoke free - What should I do to celebrate?

Hey there, fellow fresh-air fans!

Tomorrow I barely have any class, and I think it's fitting to celebrate being smoke free for a week.  What sort of activities do you relish now (preferably not involving use of other drugs or egregiously intense exercise) that you couldn't enjoy as much/at all if you still smoked?  Throw as many ideas at me as you want... I hope to make this a weekly affair, doing different things each week.  Thanks in advance, and good luck to all of you!!!

What for?

Hi. I smoke one, two, or three cigarettes every day. I hide it from most except family or anyone who sees me regularly. I smoke after work at the end of the day. The only problems I have with it currently is the unnecessary expense, and the issue of hiding it. 

If I have to go home for a few days, or go out of town with friends for more than a couple nights, I get anxious because I know I won't be able to be myself and smoke. 

I always say I am going to quit. I read stories of people who smoke 2+ packs a day who quit cold turkey. I don't know why I've gone so long without even really trying. I live alone, and have no one to answer to. No real motivation I guess.

What do you guys think is the best way to quit? And how? It sounds like such a small change, but feels like a huge one. New to this subreddit so I hope I have followed the rules. Thanks for any advice.

On Day Three

So I've tried to quit cigs many times before, the longest attempt was for about a month two years ago. So basically I've been smoking a pack a day for 10 years with small breaks here and there (I'm 27 now). If I was out drinking it could be 2 packs in a night. Some of my attempts lasted no more than a couple of hours. I even read Allan Carr's book and that didn't seem to help all that much. This time it feels different. Instead of "I'm quitting" I think "I quit." It actually hasn't been too difficult these first few days, at least not how I remember it in the past. I realized if not now then when and the longer I put it off the harder it's going to be. 

I think most smokers think that they want to stop but they put that off in the vague near future because the idea of actually going through with this process scares them. "Oh I'll quit soon" but never do. And that's where I was. But Monday night came and I was pretty much hacking up a lung as I was leaving the office. And I still finished my cigarette and had a few more that night as well. And at the end of the night I had two smokes left and I said what the hell, just do it. So I found some unexpired patches from a failed attempt this summer and I've been going strong for 3 days. There are definitely moments, like about 10 minutes ago, where I almost can't handle the anxiety, but that passes. I just have to remember that this isn't a real need, not like water. There was a time I didn't smoke. I don't have to satisfy that urge, I can fight it. My basic attitude is don't be upset that you can't satisfy this urge but rather be annoyed that the urge is there and feel strong when you say no. I just hope I keep this up!

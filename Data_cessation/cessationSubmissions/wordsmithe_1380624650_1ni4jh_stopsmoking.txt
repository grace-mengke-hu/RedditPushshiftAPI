It's my second "first week" and I think it's going well

While it has been my third attempt to quit, it has been my second “first week” of quitting.  There are some differences between my other attempts and my current one and I would like to share some thoughts.


First and most importantly, thank you /r/stopsmoking. You guys have been the greatest support system. There is no one around me that supports me quite like you guys. It’s hard to understand how hard it is to quit if you never have smoked, or don’t want to quit anytime soon. Every time I feel stressed or want to smoke, I come here to see how others have struggled and overcame the addiction.


The one thing I don’t understand about my nicotine withdrawals are why I just want to smoke. I don’t think I miss the nicotine, I only miss the act of puffing on a cigarette.  I went out to the bars last weekend and, like many of us here, really wanted to smoke after having a few drinks.  Instead, I rolled up a receipt into a cigarette and started smoking it like I was an elementary school student imitating the movies.  Surprisingly, it helped. Just the act of puffing, holding air in my mouth, then breathing made me feel great. If someone can help me understand this strange habit, I’d be very grateful.


Other than that instance, I have taken the Carr approach by not using substitutes.  I just shrug off the withdrawal pang and keep going on with my life.  Sometimes the pangs are longer than others, but they’re all “signs of healing”.


Anyways, thanks again to all of you for helping me through this time.  I’ll constantly be on these boards looking for and providing any help when I can.

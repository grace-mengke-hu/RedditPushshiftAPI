Overcoming my biggest trigger - any tips?

Hi all

So I'm a 26 yo male who has been smoking for roughly 10 years. For the past few years, the habit has reached about 25-30 cigarettes per day and I was starting to feel really terrible (health-wise), so have had a few quit attempts in that time. The longest has lasted maybe 3 months. 

I am just starting on my most recent (and last) quit and feeling good about it. Has only been a few days so far, but I'm managing pretty well with the aid of nicotine gum. 

However, my biggest trigger is always going for long road trips and deciding to buy a few smokes for the road. I just associate driving along the freeway with smoking so much it makes me crazy. Every single previous quit has been lost to this trigger. 

Now, I need to take about a 5hour drive this weekend for work and wanted to know if anyone has any suggestions for overcoming this trigger (or other tips generally)? It's such a hard one because you don't face the trigger as often so can't learn to disassociate as easy as (for example) the morning coffee smoke. Long trips by myself are also so boring, I just constantly think about sparking up! :(

Thanks in advance.

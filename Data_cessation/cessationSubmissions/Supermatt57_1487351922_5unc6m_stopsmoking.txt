I feel better, cravings are pretty much gone

I even tried using my vape and the smell just turned me off right away. It's hard to believe I used to think it tasted good. cigarette smoke smells really strongly, and I notice it as really nasty on my friends. It's amazing how food just tastes so good, too.

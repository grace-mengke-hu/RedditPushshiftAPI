Quit last Sunday

I was a smoker for two years and a non-smoker for the last six days. This turned out to be easier than I thought -- I only have to get through the occasional triggered craving, e.g. just a few minutes ago the girl on the right in [this yt vid](http://youtu.be/FFrZfluKDrc?t=3m8s). I just thought of sitting in a coffeeshop, drinking coffee and smoking and boom! an anxious cravy feeling in my stomach arose..

I can't wait for my body to restore itself to normal functioning. This subreddit inspired me and helped me quit, and for that I'm very grateful. Anyone can do this, so remember: you're a non-smoker, you don't need to light up. (Alan Carr, thanks)

When should I quit in the next 2 weeks?

So, I think I'm gonna make it this time but confused about when i should quit. Best but risky case is, now. I just fear giving in at tuesday, I will hang out with my smoker friends and deal with some stressing shit. Then I'll have 1 week free time and 1 week of stress again(finals and projects)
I have 3 options,

 Now

2 days later, tuesday night

2 weeks later when I'm completely free.


What do you think? I'm leaning on tuesday night right now.
I have 1 pack left, I don't think of buying another one ever.

Sick of smoking, sick of failing

I'm 23 years old, been smoking since I was 15. I've made numerous attempts to quit, have often gone months without smoking, only to crack on a social occasion. My last streak of 3 months without smoking ended a little under a week ago when I got drunk and indulged a cigarette. It hasn't gotten out of hand yet as I've limited myself to a couple cigarettes day, but it will if I don't act soon. One big thing that's been missing has been accountability, so I figured that making the most of this subreddit could help me get through this once and for all. Wish me luck.

Hard to Resist

Longest I went this far was two days, then smoked one yesterday and today. Having lots of trouble. Girlfriend and family are here for me but sometimes scold me for smoking another one. I haven’t been smoking long but I got caught up and addicted fast and it was my release from stressful situations. Trying to set short term goals like “don’t smoke again between now and Christmas” and see how far that can take me. Also considering nicotine patches.

Wrapping up Day Three

I'm 29 years old. Been smoking non-stop for 11 years. About 2 packs a day in the last few years. Monday night, I choked myself for the last time.

Slept pretty bad through till Tuesday morning. My brain knew there was no nicotine waiting in the morning. However, the day was pretty easy. Day one over, time for bed.

Another terrible sleep, awake most of the night. Should note that I get up to smoke in the middle of the night if I wake up. The day wasn't that bad, however. Day two over. 

Slept like a rock, finally, I needed that. Today has been a bit more irritable, but absolutely nothing like the horror stories you hear. Very manageable.

Definitely looking forward till tomorrow! Hopefully on my way out, but we'll see....

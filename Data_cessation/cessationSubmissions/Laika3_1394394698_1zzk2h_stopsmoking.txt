The best birthday present

Today I gave myself the best birthday present - 2 weeks without smoking. I feel very confident in myself now and can see myself tackling anything. I even went on a really nice 3.5 mile run yesterday. I was able to go out and drink last night without worrying about going out to smoke or smelling bad. So 21 is going to be my year. I'm only going to keep improving and see that number go up.

To those of you in your first couple of day, just hang on. Your future self will thank you so much. Smoking becomes a passing thought pretty quickly and you begin to see yourself as so much more than an addict. You can and will beat that monster.

I'm currently sick, have a cold and a fever and haven't smoked for two days because it makes me nauseous. Should I take this opportunity and quit for good?

I've been member here for a while with a couple of half assed attempts of quitting.

This weekend I started to get sick, with a runny nose, sore throat, headaches and a fever. I tried to smoke once out of habit but felt disgusted by it for some reason and I haven't smoked for a couple of days. I don't even feel the nicotine urge, the sickness pains/discomfort is simply too intense.

Should I take this opportunity and stop? I figure, not smoking for a couple of days should get the worst of the withdrawal out of my system and since I don't even feel any withdrawal, why not just go with it?

Has anyone experience this? That the urge to smoke completely disappears when you're knocked on your ass by headaches/fever/sicknesses?

**Edit**: Ok fuck this shit. It's decided. No more smoking. I've got my badge, downloaded an app, read all your posts, got my mind straight. Theres no turning back now. The day I see a double digit on my badge I know I've made it.

Thanks for all the support. This sub is really like this pic someone posted before: http://i.imgur.com/sCiU5Wm.jpg

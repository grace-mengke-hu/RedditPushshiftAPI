First Day Smoke-Free!

I really just wanted to post this somewhere because I'm super proud of myself - after weaning down to one cigarette a day and struggling to get past that point, today was the first day I made it without a single one! Quitting has been super difficult but even with the tapering down I already feel so much better!

Is cold turkey possible?

I quit for over a year and 2 months ago started again after a night of drinking and weeks of a horribly stressful worklife. I got back on the chantix and I just can't take those pills anymore and it didn't work. I went on vacation and barely smoked and now that i'm back im stuck in the routine again. 

Every single time I try I fail, and fail and fail.. next week me and my wife are going to try to start fasting and I am going to try to quit then but any helps appreciated.

Quitting on holidays was easy. Now I'm back to work and it's hard.

I have quit smoking for almost three weeks. I quit during holidays on purpose because work is always a trigger for me. It has been easy and a pleasure to be a non-smoker during my holidays. Today I am back to work and am finding it difficult. My head buzzes, begging for a smoke. Any advice?

Day 3 yoga

I might be a little too excited, but yesterday was day 3 for me and I had an awesome experience during yoga.
My mind was a bit scrambled which tends to be normal for quitting any drug. What amazed me the most was the amount of sweat pouring from my body, and how intuitive everything was. Best part though...

HOLY SHIT I CAN BREATHE!

Have a good day everyone.

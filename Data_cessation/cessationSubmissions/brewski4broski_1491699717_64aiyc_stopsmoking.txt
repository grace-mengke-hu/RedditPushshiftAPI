The first 28 days were hard

But I gave up drinking as well, and I became a hermit. on the 29th day, I went to a bar with a bunch of friends who smoked. I got shitface drunk, and forced them to blow smoke at me while they smoked their cigarettes, and I refused to have one. After putting up with that, it was easy.

1000 days later, I stand by what I said. Last the first 4 weeks and then it's a breeze. Good luck to all.

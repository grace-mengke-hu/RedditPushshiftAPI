Losing weight + quit smoking same time = any success stories and how to's?

This topic somewhat applies to those who had wishes to lose excess weight, but can be mindfully applied to those who would like to maintain their current weight and minimize/prevent any added weight gain due to cessation from smoking cigarettes. Moreover, the idea of weight management (i.e. to lose / maintain in this instance), can surely play a factor preventing one not trying to quit. Conversely, the ones who were looking to gain weight, might have some more flexible options & outcomes from this (provided you monitor and address your weight gain progress in the form of a considered diet/exercise as needed).

All we usually hear (and many have come to accept) is the exact opposite, but I think this is due to : 

* substituting cigarettes for more food/snacks (healthy or otherwise).

* From my understanding, your basal metabolic rate might slow down a bit to maybe cause weight gain (your caloric needs are possibly lower than if you were to eat the same while you were still smoking, thus if you ate the same amount of calories, you could gain it that way).

So now, I'd love to hear the possibilities of this not happening (i.e. preventing) - has anyone simultaneously stopped smoking and effectively lost excess weight by lowering their caloric intake and perhaps, utilizing a strength/cardio/conditioning program? What were the results?

If there is any scientific literature that you may have come across that shows people who have lost weight upon quitting, that would be a great link/citation to know.  

Hopeful intentions that this topic can motivate others for the new year!

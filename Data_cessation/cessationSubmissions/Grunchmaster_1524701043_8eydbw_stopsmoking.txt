Just relapsed...

Hey everyone, for some reason when I got home from school today I just couldn't get my mind off a cigarette. The first few days I was doing fine, able to deal with whatever urges that hit. I've always heard that the first three days were the hardest, but now I'm not so sure... I was able to make it through those, but it seemed to just get harder as time went on. Anyway, I just went out and smoked half a cigarette, it didn't even make me feel good, I got a tiny buzz. I just feel so stupid, all that hard work from the days before are ruined. I hate the fact that I'm gonna have to reset and go through the first few days again. I can already feel my chest starting to hurt again. It's just hard, because they're so easy to get. All I have to do is step out on the front porch and grab one because my mom smokes. I know they're out there taunting me, telling me that within 15 seconds I could go out and light up. Anyway, do you guys have any tips to stay motivated? I'm 17 years old, I don't want to carry this repulsive addiction with me throughout my life.

Thanks for reading everyone, I hope you have better luck than I did on your quitting journey.

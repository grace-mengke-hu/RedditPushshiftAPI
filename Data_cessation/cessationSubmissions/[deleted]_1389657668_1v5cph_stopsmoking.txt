I am a non-smoker. Never again will I smoke another cigarette.

Recently I have been trying to quit cold turkey. I've been smoking on and off for 8 years since I was 15, I was a PAD smoker for the past 4-5 years.

I've read Allen Carr's book 2-3 times within the past few days as I've been battling a case of Bronchitis. It has really opened my eyes to the nasty side of nicotine addiction, what a filthy and disgusting habit  smoking truly is and I am ready to quit. 

I want to be healthy, I want to be smoke-free, more importantly I want to enjoy life. I am tired of feeling down, having anxiety, and being stressed over a stick that will ultimately shorten my life.

I've made it to three days and foolishly had one cigarette which has slowly grown to 2, 3, 4 in the past couple of days. Tonight at 9PM EST I will be smoking my final cigarette. 

The thought of contracting an incurable disease because I so foolishly neglected my health as a young man terrifies me. I want to grow old with my fiance, I want to watch my children get married, I want to enjoy life as a non-smoker instead of continuously waiting for the moments to pass that I can have a cigarette and feeling terrible about myself.

I figure that posting here rather than lurking will really help me stick with my commitment. I am inspired by many of the stories that you all share and how far everyone has come.

Any words of encouragement or advise is warmly welcomed. Here's to you /r/stopsmoking.

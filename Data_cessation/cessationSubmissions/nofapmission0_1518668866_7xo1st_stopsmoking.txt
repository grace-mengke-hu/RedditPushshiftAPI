College student here! Started smoking since dec2016

Got into college and had my first smoke, since then at least three per day. I smoke more around exam time believing that it will help as stress buster. But I have found that it does nothing to help! I want to stop before I get some disease or turn into a heavy smoker. Evertime I go home in vacations I stop smoking because the friend circle I have at home still belive I am the good boy who doesn't smokes or drinks, but when i return to my uni dorm smoking starts. It tastes really bad after a long break but it gets better after a week or two and I get into my old habit. The vacations are still 4 months away and I want to stop right now!!! 

Pray for me!!! ‡•ê

It's been 1 decade since I last smoked a cigarette

[So it's been a full decade since I typed this desperate post way back when.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/9g222/askreddit_its_been_58_hours_since_i_quit/)  

Well, I can proudly say that it has been a full decade since the last time I smoked a cigarette.  I want everyone on this sub to know that it can be done.  It's hard and you have to make some real life decisions to keep yourself away from smoking.  To me, by far the biggest factor was mental attitude.  I had some quit sessions before (1 lasted for one year) and they all relapsed when I was overwhelmed at work, at life, or intoxicated in an environment which lead to an easy "Can I get a smoke moment".  

To beat this, you really must be in the position mentally to make cigarettes your enemy in your mind.  When I quit, I was thinking in my head that either I will win this battle or it will take me early.  It was incredibly hard for the first month.  Then it leveled off for the next year, but I was still tempted.  But after a while the battle really turned in my favor.  Every day, month, and year was gradually easier.  

I no longer get cravings under any circumstance.  That may not be the case with other people, just my own experience.  

Let me know if there are any questions or if you need advice.  I'll do my best to answer!

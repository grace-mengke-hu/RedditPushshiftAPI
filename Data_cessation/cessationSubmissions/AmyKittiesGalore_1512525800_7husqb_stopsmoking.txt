Cleaned up an ashtray today

Emptied the nasty overflowing ashtray in the back patio today. (roommates still smoke) It was actually great! In the past, I may have been tempted to smoke some of the longer butts. (You know we have all done it) But the ashtray looked and smelled SO GROSS to me, I wasn't even tempted, not for a second! The whole thing was just disgusting. WIN!

Should i read it again?

So, I really want to quit. Once I quit for about a week after reading allen carr, but relapsed. Do you think it can work if I read it again?  Sorry for bad english 

Ps: if you havent already, I recommend watching “The Insider”. Amazing movie that also exposes the lies of tobacco companies. A quote frío the movie: “cigarretes are a delivery device for nicotine “

Thank you all!!

Today I'm freeing myself from cigarettes

This year has been incredibly tough. For a while, I was using that as an excuse to smoke and drink myself silly. But everyday, I wake up feeling so crappy. Sore throat, coughs, bad sleep. I'm tired of it. And I'm tired, literally. I hate feeling so old when I'm only 25. I should be out having fun, being active, but instead I'm usually holed up in my house drinking, or freezing my butt off smoking outside in the cold. 

I'm so tired of it. There's no reason to keep doing this. 

So, today it stops. I'm glad this sub is here for my journey.

I can't believe it's been 3 years

Holy Crap, and I even forgot my third anniversary.  Let me just say folks, it gets easier and eventually - you don't even think about it at all anymore.

I actually came to the sub today to check my flair because I forgot how long it's been since I quit, and I saw I just hit the three year mark!

I rarely ever think about smoking anymore.  Occasionally I'll walk by someone smoking and the smell will take me back, but I know from experience that cigarettes will never taste as good as they did when I used to smoke every day.  I'll never go back, and that makes me a little sad, but also really happy that I really have beaten the bastards. :)

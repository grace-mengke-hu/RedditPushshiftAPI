35 Days and I'm still depressed. But not smoking.

I posted at 16 days when I was experiencing the beginning of what was to become a long chain of events... and now it's worse. I am losing my mind. But I'm not posting this because it has anything to do with withdrawals... my depression is unrelated. This has to do with my strength.

I have done some really awful things in the past few weeks, and now I'm worse (emotionally) than I ever have been. 

BUT I AM NOT SMOKING. I AM NOT USING THIS AS AN EXCUSE TO START KILLING MYSELF SLOWLY AGAIN. I AM 35 DAYS FREE OF HELL AND I AM NOT GOING BACK. 

Whatever you're going through is not an excuse to smoke. I sure as hell am not making excuses. If I can do this, you sure as hell can too. (:

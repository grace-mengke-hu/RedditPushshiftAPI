Nicotine withdrawal and anxiety

Hello everyone, I've been trying to quit on and off for the past year or so and I've recently run into a snag. When i go without cigarettes for a day or so I start getting intense anxiety. It's almost as if the volume on everything around me goes up, and I cant seem to concentrate through the mental fog. Anyone know some coping mechanisms to help with this? Never had any issues with anxiety outside of the occasionally difficult college exam, so this is relatively foreign to me.

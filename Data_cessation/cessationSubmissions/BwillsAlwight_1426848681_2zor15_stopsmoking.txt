on my 4th day...

...I'm feeling a little stressed, with work, with people. I took it out on my girlfriend this morning by just being a snappy asshole and it made me feel even worse. I havn't smoked though, but i can feel today is going to be a challenge. Any words of encouragement or any tips to curb my stress levels would be greatly appreciated.

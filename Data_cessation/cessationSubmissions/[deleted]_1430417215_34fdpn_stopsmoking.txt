Just quit and need helpful advice

So I smoked for just over 2 years and I was never a pack a day, but when I got to a pack every other day I realized I was going to kill myself if I kept going. I'm going on 2 weeks cold turkey and I get moments where I'm on the verge of breaking whenever I walk past someone who's smoking and catch the smell. 

Is there any advice y'all can offer me that may help endure this most awful of temptations? I'm currently at a university with about a 1/3 asian campus, so just trying to avoid people smoking is almost impossible. Thanks for any and all advice you can offer.

TL;DR How do I resist the urge to smoke whenever I walk by someone who's smoking?

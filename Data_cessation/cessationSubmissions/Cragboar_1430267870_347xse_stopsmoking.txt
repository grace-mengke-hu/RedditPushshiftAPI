About to begin quit attempt #4.... Going with Champix this time, help needed.

Hi Guys, 

I've tried to quit previously using a variety of methods,I quit for a few months using the e-cigs, but would always relpase when I ran out liquid.

I've read Mr Carr's book and quit cold turkey until I got drunk one night....

I've tried the gum and patches which were by far the worst out of the lot...

Now I've asked my doctor for champix and due to a number of health scares am very serious about quitting this time... I just need some help if you could.

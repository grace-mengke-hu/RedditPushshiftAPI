Those annoying days

Hello dear redditers.

I have been trying to quit for a while now, using various methods, but always cold turkey.

The thing is that every time I fail, it's pretty much always the same reason: those days where you're suddenly not thinking clearly, being overwhelmed and just going for a pack on autopilot.

And I think the biggest problem is that it's typically if I haven't had a proper lunch, so I confuse hunger with a withdrawal pang; most likely because I got used to smoke instead of eating; not that it completely relieves the hunger, but it subdues it a little.

Does anyone relate? I really don't know how to combat those days. HELP PLEASE.

What to expect at 90 days?

So, this is the longest I have ever been smoke free. I splurged today and bought myself a car with the money I'm saving as a non-smoker. I was spending $300+ per month on smokes, now I'm spending less than that on a car payment for a car that doesn't smell like cigarettes! 

However, I know that I've got one more major hump ahead. The three month mark --
 the last of the "terrible threes." How terrible is it? I quit using NRT through a work program (patches, starting from 21mg, tapering down to 14 and then 7, been off of them for a couple of weeks now), and am still taking Zyban. Will probably continue to take that for another month or so.

Just curious if you guys had any insight on what to expect in around the three month mark. I'm hoping that going outside everyday and looking at my beautiful, smoke free car will be enough inspiration to not even think about them. 

And as an aside: I had my first span of a couple of days where I didn't think about smoking at all! Not until I ran across my neighbor who was smoking. Feels good, man :)

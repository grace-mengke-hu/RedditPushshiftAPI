I'm smoking my last cigarette

I'm now smoking the last cigarette of my life before I go to sleep. I've been a smoker for ten years and I just finished reading Allen Carr's book, so as of tomorrow I will be a non-smoker for life. 

I will probably keep you updated with my progress as I've been a lurker for a few months. 

Please tell me what should I look forward to. How did your life improve since you stopped? 

Thanks everyone!

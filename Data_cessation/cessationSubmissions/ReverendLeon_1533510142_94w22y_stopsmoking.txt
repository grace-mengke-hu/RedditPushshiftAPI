So...I decided to quit again after 196 days

This is my 13th day, and I feel pretty good. I smoked for 196 days after last time I tried to quit (could survive only 7 days). There is only one problem. I have been on vacation with my parents for this time. Tomorrow I will go to work and I’m afraid I won’t be able to resist. I think over and over this situation, what will I do once I want the cig? My friend will tell me ‘let’s go for a smoke’. 
So I have decided that at first I will inform all of my colleagues that I quit smoking, I’m gonna ask them to stop inviting me for a smoke....but will I be able to stay strong and resist? I AM AFRAID!
When I was on vacation with parents I was not even thinking about smoking, even though my mom smokes so hard. I could easily observe her smoking in front of me and I didn’t care at all. Parents don’t know I smoke ( or smoked ). I am afraid that tomorrow I will again feel this disappointment and pain bc Of cigs. Guys please please please advice how to overcome this situation. I can’t escape smoking by changing the job, I can only do something once I want to smoke. I have already written why I should not smoked, why I want this, I realize this situation, but I am like a vampire who wants to drink blood, I have this unpleasant burning feeling like I want to eat. Don’t know what to do tomorrow.

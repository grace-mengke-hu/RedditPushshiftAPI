Day 13! I'm a freaking rockstar!

We all are! This has been by far the most successful quit for me...in over 25 years of smoking this is the first time I've quit and had absolutely no desire to smoke again. Had drinks last night, didn't want to smoke...stressed at work, don't smoke...bored at home, not smoking...I don't recognize this healthy person lol but I'm loving it! 

Cravings pass if I have them...I've convinced myself I just don't want to smoke. I've been smelling my friends and coworkers who smoke and can't believe I smelled like that myself. 

The only bitch right now is the worse heartburn ever but this too shall pass. 

Everyone keep up the great work! You got this!

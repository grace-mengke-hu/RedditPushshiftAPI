Couple of relapses, but the quitting continues

Quit(ish, using lozenges atm) near the start of February, had a drinking night with my wife where we both got buzzed and ended up smoking, then dropped it again for a few days.  Then a death in the family led to 5 days of smoking full bore with a grieving family full of smokers.

Now it's been 8 days since the last one, yesterdays cravings were pretty bad, but I held out.  I'm just curious how I am ever going to eliminate the lozenges!  I don't want to trade one nicotine delivery system for another!

Any words of wisdom?  I could use the help.

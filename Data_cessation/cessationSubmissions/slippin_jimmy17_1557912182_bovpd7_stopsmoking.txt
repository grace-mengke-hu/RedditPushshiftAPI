Question - Ability to concentrate

Hello, I am 30 years old and smoke a pack a day for about 10 years now.  Not yet been able to quit for more than 3 days in a row. What killed it for me every time was this kind of fog you get in your head. Lack of concentration and restlessness. I am sure many of you guys know that feeling.

Unfortunately I work from home, have a stressful job and a important project going on. These things are actually more important than quitting at this point. I understand that this feeling will go away and I could take it easy for some time without a problem. 

Yet, I'd appreciate if those of you who successfully quit could answer the following questions **honestly:**

&amp;#x200B;

1. How do you rate your level of maximum concentration? Before quitting and now.
2. How do you rate your level of concentration over a longer period ( 4 hours without break for example)?
3. Do you crave cigarettes or suffer somehow during these periods?
4. Can you **truly** enjoy a good meal and a glass of red wine? ( another doubt I have )

&amp;#x200B;

I learned that concentration and energy are supposed to increase long term, but reading through here and hearing feedback from people I know who quit, I get the impression that the effects health experts and quit smoking campaigns promise, don't always line up to the real thing. That's why I ask here.

Thank you for reading!

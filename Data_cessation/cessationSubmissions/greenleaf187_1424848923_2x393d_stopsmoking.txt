I started my quitting process. So excited!

Hello all,

First of all, I would like to say thank you to everybody in this community for their wonderful stories and strength to quit smoking. I have been visiting this community for a while when I planned on quitting just last year.

I was going through a lot of stress at work and at home, which kind of was an excuse for me not to quit last year. But last month, I realized these excuses were stupid. So I decided to cut down and set a date to completely quit.

A little background, I started smoking 8 years ago at an age of 16. Cigarettes were cheap where I live, and almost everybody smoked. I quit a few times, but only for a couple of months and so. I believe it is time now.

I used to smoke a pack a day, sometimes 2 packs in the weekends. But last month I felt my lungs getting heavier and waking up in the morning was the worst thing ever. So exactly two weeks ago, I started smoking one cigarette less every day. No I am down to only 4 cigarettes, and hopefully in 4 days I will be down to zero.

Some of the things that I am worried about, and would need your advice and experience, is what to do when I quit. I am short tempered (I would say mild anger issues), and I can feel it now becoming more frequent that I have cut down. I get irritated by the smallest things from where my mom places my things in my apartment when she's visiting, to drivers not using the turn signal. How do you guys deal with that? (apart from anger management).

Secondly, how do you deal with cravings? Should I use patches or gums? Or drown myself in food and sugar? I go to the gym regularly and am following a specific diet.

Anything else that I need to keep in mind?

Highly appreciate your help and support!

Was I an emotionless robot before quitting, and just didn't realize it?

I'm lurking on here like every day and want to say thanks to all of you. When I get a craving that's hard to ignore, this is the place I go to remind myself why I quit. You rock :D

Day 10 and physically I feel good, but wow! I am so emotional! I read on here somewhere that we've used smoking to numb our emotions...so when you remove the smoking, you've got to face the emotions finally. I seriously never considered anything like that when I got fed up with my addiction and finally quit for good.

I know I can work through this, that's not a problem, but I guess I'm sort of shocked at what's under the surface without my pack of cigarettes. Like, I really hate my job. And I've been coping with that hate for 8+ hours of my day for YEARS by sneaking out back to smoke, so I don't have to think about how stressed, lonely, and miserable work makes me feel. Now I have to deal with it head on. It's wild.

If anyone has any tips for working through how emotional this process is, I'd be grateful. Much love to you all and keep it up! We can do this!

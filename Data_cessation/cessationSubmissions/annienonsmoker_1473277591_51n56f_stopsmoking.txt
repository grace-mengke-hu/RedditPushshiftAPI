Been lurking lots....thanks all!

I've been lurking on here for the last 6 days, which is how long I've given up for. You guys have definitely helped me stay off the nicotine so I just wanted to log on and say thanks in person! It's still a little but of a struggle at times, and I have rather a short fuse too, but I know it will pass and I'm so chuffed to have made it to 6 days! Thanks so much to you all for the advice you've been giving to each other this week which has really made a huge difference!

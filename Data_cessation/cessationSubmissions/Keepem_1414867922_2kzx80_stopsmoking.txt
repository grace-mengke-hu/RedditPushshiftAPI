Small desire to smoke

I seem to keep getting a longing for a cigarette lately. I don't know why that would be happening. If I'm around people that smoke, I can sometimes get them. But I think I might be just thinking of the cigarettes with the small buzz I get from them. Usually following the thought is, "That would be really dumb for you to have to endure all that pain again just for one or two buzzes"

My addiction is very tricky, even years later it's coming back at me trying to convince me to have another smoke. I'll see unlit cigarettes and want to light it up on impulse, but I just let the thought go. I can stand in the middle of a smoker's circle and not get a single craving. My mind likes to remember the good, and forget the bad. I **know** the bad is infinitely worse than any good, but my first thought tries to trick me. That's why I always go with my second thought.

To everyone who's quitting now, this isn't a discouraging post because the battle I face today is a completely different beast. When I first quit I felt like the pain of cigarettes would never end, but that's not true, because before I knew it I would no longer hurt for a cigarette, my withdrawals were disappearing, and I could think straight. I have none of those problems. What I'm feeling is a longing to smoke because of the "good" memories, not out of necessity. So if you're in major pain, I understand and I know from my experience it will pass.

Day two: I'm losing my mind at the office.

Yesterday was pretty easy, which lured me into a false sense of security that I "wasn't that hooked" on ciggs. I was wrong!   
  
I have the step two patch on, so I'm not sure whether the source of my anger/anxiety/complete lack of focus is due to the lack of ciggs, or the fact that the 14mg of nicotine is more than I was smoking per day. Either way, at my desk job, I have thought about nothing other than leaving to buy a pack since I sat down. Any advice?

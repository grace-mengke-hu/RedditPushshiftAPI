Thoughts on gum/patches?

New to the sub.. Just found it basically. Figured if I am gonna try and quit might as well see if reddit has a sub for that. Of course they do haha but what are your guys thoughts the nicotine gum and patches? 
Has anyone used it successfully or is it all a bunch of smoke? (terrible pun intended)

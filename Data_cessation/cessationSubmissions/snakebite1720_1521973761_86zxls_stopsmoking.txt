Day 10 as a non smoker but its getting difficult

Guys,

It's been 10 days as a non smoker and 3 days without any nicotine content. In the early days was using nicotine gums  but stopped them completely now for 3 days. But now am getting this huge urge to smoke daily for last 2 days which don't go at all. Am resisting it one at a time but there seems no end of it.

I used to smoke upto 10 ciggrate a day and decided to stop it completely just for no reason and to live a healthy life. And now am getting second thoughts about it. 

Also to let you guys know for some other reasons I have stopped drinking and started dieting around the same time as well as my gym plan. I excercise 6 days a week and given all this happening at the same time it's getting difficult for me to keep up without smoking one of it. I don't want it. I want it. Fuck its too much.

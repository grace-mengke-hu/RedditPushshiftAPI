Been making small strides, looking to push further.

Hey guys! This is my first time really acknowledging my desire to quit other than "some day". I still don't know if I'm ready to take the plunge yet but I'm making good progress so far I think. 

I picked up the pack around 21-22, I'm 23 now. I smoke about one pack per week, so I'm still well within the territory where it's possible. 

I think I could quit if it wasn't for my job. I'm a clerk at a gas station and it's in a rural area. About half of my customers are for cigarettes, and about half the time is spent doing nothing waiting for a customer. That's a major problem for me--I'm stuck alone in this gas station with nothing but time and cigarettes. 

At my peak, I was smoking eight cigarettes per shift, one per hour. I've been slowly phasing them out. Every month I've been adding half an hour between cigarettes that I allow myself to have. I'm now at 3 hours per cigarette, which has cut it down from 9 (including the smoke on my way to work) to 4. I'm proud of that, but it's still not enough. However, every time I force myself to wait longer, it becomes slightly more difficult. Three hours has already been a challenge but I'm holding on thus far. 

I'm not certain how to push it further. While cold turkey may be theoretically possible, I feel that it would turn my work shifts into nightmares of boredom and craving. I could use some advice on how to stop cravings while idle. If I'm with a friend or something I can go the whole day on 1 or even 0 on a really good day. But when I'm alone, here with nothing but smokes and time, it's really difficult. 

Could use some advice or well wishes! Not exactly sure what the point of this post is but I feel like it's good to start posting here.

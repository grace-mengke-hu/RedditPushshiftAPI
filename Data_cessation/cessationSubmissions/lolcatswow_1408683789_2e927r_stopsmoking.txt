Medical Marijuana success stories?

I am stuck between in a little bit of a rock and a hard place.

First, I'll be 40 in a few, I've been a smoker 20 years, give or take.

I'm doing better lately, I switched to the Swisher Sweet cigars (sweet, non-filtered), I usually limit myself to two of those per day.

I also like to drink. I don't want to stop drinking.

That being said, I think I need to stop drinking to entirely cut off the cigarette habit, from something a methadone patient said to me about ascleropathy once.

So far so good. How often should I use marijuana? In what form? Should I make cookies? I thought what I would try to do is wake up, say my prayers, eat one Thomas English muffin, drink coffees, *smoke one marijuana, Rinse, repeat. 

In that exact order every day.

Is that a good idea?

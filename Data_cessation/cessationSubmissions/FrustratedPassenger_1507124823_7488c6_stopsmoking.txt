DAY ONE

So here I am at work for the last 3 hours without a smoke. I managed to get here without pulling over for a cigarette. 

A coworker tried to give me a difficult time and I didn't  blow up or smoke over it. Move along, Hopalong McCrazyPants, you are a nutjob and I am not.

Yeah so I'm 13 hours, 38 minutes along and doing ok so far. Nothing will be getting done at work this week. HA! But I quit smoking and that's a major thing!!!!

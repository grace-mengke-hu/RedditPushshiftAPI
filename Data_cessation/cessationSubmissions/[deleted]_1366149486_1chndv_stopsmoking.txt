It's been 9 days, and I've smoked only one cigarette.

Honestly I haven't had any cravings except when I went to a party, which is when I smoked. This might also be due in part to the fact that I haven't really left the house. Ha! I don't know what's different this time, but I'm really proud of myself, watching that little ticker next to my username climb up each day.

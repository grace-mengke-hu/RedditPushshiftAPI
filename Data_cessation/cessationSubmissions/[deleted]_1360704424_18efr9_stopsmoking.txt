Strong "emty need"

Today my brain just wanted something really strong, but it could not express exactly what. So the brain made me go out of the house and to the market. I *had* to go. The brain was sure I had to have something,  but could not explain just what. I tried like different sections, food, chips, carbonated drinks,  sweets, even beer. I asked if any of the stuff was likeable. But brain did not confirm on anything. So at last I gave up and we went home again with nohing and it was ok. I still wonder if this really was the nicotine monster in some form, hinting in the shadows. Like a shy monster afraid to speak up and face the battle. Now it does not matter. Ofcourse the monster would have lost if it had tried an open mental fight because I really do not want a sigarette or to be a smoker. Is this normal?

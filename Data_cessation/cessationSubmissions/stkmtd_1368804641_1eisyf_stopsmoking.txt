Oh, look at that... Has it been a week? ^_^

As much as I still feel weird in the head, I want everyone to know that at this point you feel major improvement. I can breathe.

I realize now how much I would avoid certain activities citing reasons other than the fact that I was massively out of shape and in denial.

To all of you at 2 or 3 days: PUSH THROUGH. It seems to take an eternity but you'll be glad you did... Now... if only I could quit coffee. :P

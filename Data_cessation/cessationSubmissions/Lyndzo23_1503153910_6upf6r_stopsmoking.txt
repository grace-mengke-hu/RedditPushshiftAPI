Ladies.....please help! If any guys know anything too by all means...

I'm 3 days away from 4 weeks quit. This has been an emotional roller coaster for me.  Had a week of feeling pretty good physically and emotionally. Then out of nowhere start feeling like crap and crying Sunday through today. I noticed that this is pms time. Did any of you have crazy pms the first month or so? Just wondering if quitting does something to female hormones. I will cry about nothing and think about smoking so much the past week. I'm really trying to take all of this as signs of healing and practice acceptance. But my emotions get the better of me and kick up doubts. I sound like a broken record to those supporting me. I'm just struggling and need reassurance that this shit gets better. Thank you for any help or insight!

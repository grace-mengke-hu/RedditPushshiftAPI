10 days :S

Today and yesterday was the hardest day so far... I almost gave in today because I just feel like shit for the last 10 days and I don't want to feel this way anymore. The worst part was that I found a pack of tabaco but no papers and really felt tempered to buy papers and smoke one. Smoking would be nice right now but hell no do I not want to ruin my health and throw my money away and smell like the devil. 

I'm still angry and insecure around people and I hate it. ยบ;...;ยบ. Tomorrow I will eat all the hamburgers because eating is the only thing I enjoy lately.

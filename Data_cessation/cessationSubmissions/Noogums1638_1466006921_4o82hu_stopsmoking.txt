Moving from the Last 52 to the New 52.

This sub has gotten me to 52 days!  This is a record for me.  I am so thankful you guys and gals are here for support.  Even when I don't post, just reading the posts give me the encouragement I need to keep moving forward.

Having said all that, I have just lost my job.  Now that's a different topic for a different day on a different sub, but it is going to impact me in ways that will continue to challenge me.  While not getting paychecks will help me not buy cigarettes, the loneliness and staleness of not working create my perfect relapse storm: IDLE TIME.  When I idle, the first thing my mind would jump to is smoking.  While I smoke a cig, I would think of what to do next and then carry on with my day.  As long as I've identified that and come up with something to replace it with, I have the utmost faith in myself.  Just wanted to rejoice in my accomplishment, share my current troubles, get motivated to tackle the Next 52 days, and make comic book puns!

If I can make it through this, then I know each and every one of you can make it through your own struggles.  I have faith in you.

TL;DR: New record, life's making it harder so I vented, thankful for this sub, making comic book puns.

How do I quit smoking? I really need some advice

Okay this may sound a little bit stupid but I'm serious, how? Yeah yeah don't smoke cigarettes anymore but it's not as simple as that.


I'm 17 years old and I smoke. I know, I know, it was stupid and I regret it every day, but I really need some advice. I started smoking because I was VERY depressed, I couldn't enjoy anything anymore and I read that smoking *might* (it doesn't really tbh) help with depression, because so many depressed people smoke. So I started smoking and got addicted.


Almost half a year ago I tried to quit while I was still depressed and it went awful. I became borderline suicidal and after about 10 days I gave in and bought another pack. I have not really tried to quit since then. Right now I feel great, happiest I have been in years, but I'm still addicted. 



Right now I really want to quit. I've been sick for more than a week now and honestly if it wasn't for smoking I would have already gotten better. My throat hurts, I stink, people give me shit all the time for smoking, it hurts my wallet and if I don't have a cigarette I will feel stressed. 


The problem is is that I'm so scared that I will fail again. As I said I'm very happy now but I'm afraid I will be depressed again if I stop smoking which I want to avoid at all costs. I'm scared I will gain weight too. 


I want to quit, but it keeps me stable, it keeps me going. I've considered vaping but it's too hard to get for underage people in my country and I doubt my mom would support it. I will have to quit cold turkey, but how do I do this without going insane? Without gaining weight? I know some people quit easily and it makes me anxious. Why can't I just do it? 


This might all sound stupid but honestly I really need help reddit because I just don't know how to do this.

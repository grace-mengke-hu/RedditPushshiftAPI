A subtly different take this time

I'm 38 and a smoker for 22 years, at least a pack for 10 of those and at least 2 packs for the rest. Anyone could guess I tried to stop more than a few times already. Three times, I managed to go as far as 4 months, never longer.  


First couple of times, it was hard, really hard. I struggled every day of it. The last time, it wasn't that hard. I was more mature, I read Allen Carr and this sub was there. Then again, I don't even remember why I relapsed.

All of my attempts were very well planned. Not this time. Last Saturday, I just quit. I've seen some graphic photos about lung cancer. I probably have seen more violent and more graphic photos on the subject before, but this time something was different. That moment, I quit... I stopped. 

&amp;#x200B;

I wouldn't pick a Saturday for a quit date as my routine would prove hard for a first day. Didn't avoid my routine at all, went to a beer garden with my wife where we sat out in the open air have a nice meal, a couple of pints and smokes. Everything the same, except the smokes. 

&amp;#x200B;

I did go ahead and repeat some of my worst feared habits which are clear and strong triggers for smoking on the following day. I drank, played some online football on my ps4, watched my favorite team playing away and playing like shit. I survived them all. I even survived today's morning coffee ritual.

Strange enough, what I'm struggling with is procrastination. I'm at the office now and trying to find something to replace smoking in my sessions of procrastination instead of recognizing this as an opportunity to avoid procrastination and start being productive. These probably are the newest tricks by my mind.

48 hours are almost over. I don't want to jinx it but, I'm finding it easy this time.

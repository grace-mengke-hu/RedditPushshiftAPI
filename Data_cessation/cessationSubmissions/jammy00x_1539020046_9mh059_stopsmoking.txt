Trying to quit, feeling really bad.

I quit smoking 5 days ago, after 3 or 4 years (I’m 22). First, I just had the flu, then I thought - if I’m not smoking anyways atm, I might as well quit. It was a conscious decision. I’ve been keeping it up for 5 days now, had some cravings yesterday and the day before (before that, I kinda didn’t even have it in my head because I was so „busy“ being sick), but now that I feel better the cravings are coming back. Yesterday I managed, today was hard, also because I was outside the first time and literally EVERYWHERE, people are smoking. I also found the smell gross, but something in me really wanted it again. Then I got some bad news (my mum wants a divorce with my dad; I totally understand her, they had issues for the last couple of years and it’s getting worse, but still...) so naturally I was feeling down, then I also had a small fight with my boyfriend, one thing led to the other, I’m really moody right now. I fought it for a really long time, but in the end I still lit up that smoke. After five puffs I realized it’s not what I want, it didn’t even feel that good, the smell in my nose is disgusting. Still I feel really awful for breaking that streak I had. Idk just wanted to share

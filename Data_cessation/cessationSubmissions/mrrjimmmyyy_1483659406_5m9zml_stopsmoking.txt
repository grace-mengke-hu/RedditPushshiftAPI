need advice, to smoke or not to smoke

I've smoked cigarettes for a about a year, i recently decided to quit cold turkey. It has been about a month or so, and i just found a pack in my coat pocket with a few in there. I don't plan on smoking forever, and I have quit cold turkey for a month, so I feel I have proven to myself that I don't want to be addicted to cigarettes. Is it it'd be okay to maybe, finish this pack? Or just smoke one?

How to pick a quit date?

hey all.
I've been meaning to quit for a long time. made a few attempts with limited success.

one of the problems i have is getting started. like, I'll pick a quit date, but my brain sort of... over-rules any date i pick. "no, don't quit then. you've got exams / work commitments / family stuff. you dont want to be going through withdrawal then." etc.

so, i guess my question is if anyone has any advice for picking a date & sticking to it?

Stopping smoking when your partner still smokes?

Hi guys. Im 5 days in and I never want to smoke again. Its ruining my health and my looks and I really want this to be it!

My question is, has anyone managed to kick it whilst their partner is still smoking? My partner smokes and I know I cant force him to stop until he is ready which could be tomorrow or in 5 years. Can I do this on my own or am I destined to fail with him still smoking?

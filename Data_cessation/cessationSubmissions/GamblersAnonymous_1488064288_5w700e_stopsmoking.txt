My amazing experience quitting via prescription drugs

There was just a post on the front page about quitting smoking and it made me think of my quitting story and maybe I could help some others. I had tried a bunch of shit before: gum, cold turkey, with friends etc. Never made it past a few days. Was really sick of it and wanted to quit so bad. I heard of this drug called champix (i think, and it goes by other names). When to my doctor, got a prescription and went and picked it up. 

So how it works is you get like 2 months worth of pills. One for the morning and one for after dinner. The first week of the pill you are only taking a half dose and are still smoking. Towards the end of the week smoking starts to lose its appeal to the point were you cant do it. HERE IS THE BEST PART, you have legit 0 cravings. The pills block the nicotine receptors in your brain or some shit and it makes it so you have legit 0 physical withdrawal symptoms. 

That leave you only to deal with the habit smoking. What I did was pick up a sack of marijuana and just smoked that when I was missing that smoking routine. This is the easy part, you could totally just smoke nothing.

The only side affect I experienced was very vivid dreams. I actually enjoyed it.

This was like 5 years ago (long enough that I stoped counting how long I haven't been smoking). I strongly recommend this product to anyone who wants to quit smoking. It made quitting easy and not excruciatingly painful. Seems like the laws on prescription drug advertising make it so many people dont know about this option. I have no idea how it isnt wildly popular. All other products I tried to use to quit smoking were compleat trash compared to this.

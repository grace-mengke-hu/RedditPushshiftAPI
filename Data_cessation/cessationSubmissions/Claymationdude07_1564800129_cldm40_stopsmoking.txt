Just about 2 months clean, and I need some encouragement while waiting for brain MRI results

I'm 7 years clear of brain cancer but long story short im having symptoms, it may be back and I'm waiting for the MRI results. Ever since I knew I was getting the test again apart of me has wanted the results to show it's back and in the "you have X months to live" stage so I'd have an excuse to smoke without any family getting on my case about it. Yes I care what they think that much. Its weird, for the past month or maybe longer I've felt amazing but the last 4 days or so I feel like I have intense physical cravings all over again

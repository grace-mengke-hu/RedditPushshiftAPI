You miss it now, but you won't in a short time.

While I was quitting I felt this massive void in my life of all the things that cigarettes filled. I'm 6 months into my quit and I don't miss it at all. I don't even think about it really. And even when I see someone with a cigarette it's no different than seeing someone hold a soda.

For those of you early in your quit journey... stick with it. You'll get to the point where all that pain is just a distant memory.

Dammit, Reset my badge.

I couldn't handle it. I broke. I hate it. I made it over a week and ~~I couldn't fight it anymore~~ I gave up. Now I know I'll have the same withdrawls that made me cringe for 48 hours again and I'm really not looking forward to it, but I know that if I keep smoking I'll regret it more.

I was vulnerable yesterday. I sat around all day watching Breaking Bad on netflix, skipped going to the gym, skipped hanging out with friends, woke up late and was feeling sorry for myself. I found myself trying to justify smoking in saying that I just needed to calm down today and that I've quit before and I could quit again. 

I don't know what else to say guys and gals, I messed up again. I have been able to quit for a week, 2 months, and even 6 months. But I can't seem to stay quit. I'm lost. 

Sorry for the rant, I'm just disappointed in myself.

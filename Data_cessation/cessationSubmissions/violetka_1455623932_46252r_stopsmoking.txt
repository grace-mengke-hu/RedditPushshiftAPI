Embarking on my day 4 of not smoking

Hi there I am embarkingon my day 4 after my slip (but also day 13 or 14 or so after my real quitting).
I feel amazing. I feel happy and proud. I am also trying to totally switch my lifestyle. Healthier foods, sports and so on. I breathe very well! The coughing has stopped almost. My skin is still shit, but I hope it will improve with time. 

I also decided to start doing yoga breathing exercises, in order to motivate myself to not smoke.
Yay to not smoking! It is absolutely the best thing ever!

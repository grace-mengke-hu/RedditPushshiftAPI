quitting for good

I work as a cook at a bar. Smoking is around me all the time, it's tough to just not be tempted. Especially when the only real breaks you can take are smoking breaks. I want to know how to stop. I really want to get rid of this dumb addiction. I was never a heavy smoker, maybe a pack a week at my peak a year ago. I just get the urge and I foolishly fufil it. I've gone two weeks before and then relapsed. Any advice?

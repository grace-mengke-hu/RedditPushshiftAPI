Made it through a night out!!!

A night out with drinks. Considered repeating old behavior and buying a pack to smoke “just one” before bed and “throw out the pack”. But this time I stopped myself.  Let the craving pass. And was fine. Soooo happy to have woken up feeling good about not giving in. You’ll never regret not smoking that one.

Did anyone else have some real struggles today?

I feel like I've had a lump sum of emotional issues today which were very difficult to get trough. Now I feel antsy and restless. On top of it, I haven't been sleeping well and my sensor light is stuck on. First world problems building quickly, but I'm not craving! What were your struggles today?

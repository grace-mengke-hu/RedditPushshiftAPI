This feels really weird

Coming up on the end of full day number six. It feels really weird, but the last couple of days have been so busy at work I haven't even had time to think about smoking. Only when I'm walking home do I think "Man, I don't know what to do with my hands!"

Is that weird? I feel like I'm supposed to be more... aggitated... But even a few weeks ago, I was having to remind myself to smoke, or actively think about doing it... Who knows. Good excuse to have candy all the time!

As an aside, I feel like I am concentrating better at work, less annoyed with minor circumstances, generally more chipper at work. THAT is weird. I feel like the dark circles under my eyes are less noticeable, too.

Starting to quit...

I'm a twenty year-old in college. I've been smoking for about three years. I was always a Marlboro Lights purist, but being on a college budget, I've had to downgrade-IMO-recently, to L&Ms. After having to switch brands twice in a month for cost, I've decided this isn't worth the money. With exams having just recently finished, I probably spent sixty dollars on cigarettes in the past month. I just sent out a message to a few of my closest friends that effectively gave them permission to mug me if they caught me smoking (which they most certainly will), and my plan is tomorrow to call my parents and tell them I'm quitting, something I've been lying about doing. I'm a tiny bit terrified, but I know this is a good thing to do. I'm burning out my last pack ever, and starting Thursday, May 30, 2013, I will be nicotine free.

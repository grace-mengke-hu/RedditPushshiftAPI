I fucked up. Any help would be appreciated.

Today I smoked 2 cigarettes and a third of a spliff(Tobacco and cannabis unfiltered). After having quit everything on the 25th of July.

Words cannot describe how fucking stupid I feel. Tomorrow would have been 4 weeks. I have been having chest pains and honestly that's why I quit. I had a chest x-ray and am still waiting on the results.My chest still hurts.

I'm a twat.

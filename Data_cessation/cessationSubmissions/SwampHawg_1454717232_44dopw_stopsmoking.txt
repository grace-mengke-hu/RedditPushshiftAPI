6, 6 & 6. Hey, you knew you made a deal with the devil when you started, here's the terms to get out...

Just celebrated my 6 months, thought I'd pass along something that got passed along early to me, and now in hindsight seems about right.  Quitting smoking is 6, 6 and 6.  

First week is rough, just gotta crawl thru that barbed wire.  Your steadfast decision to quit is your greatest weapon here, whatever method you choose to go by.  The first 6 days are the boot camp of the operation, but you are not alone.

After the first 6 days, it stops stepping on your neck.  It's still there in the background, but it evolves into a low level fight, no longer a pitched battle.  Kind of like 6 weeks of having a gnat buzz around you.

 After 6 weeks it's no longer a constant hover around your consciousness, you can go a whole day without thinking about smoking and when you do, it's just a 20 second thing you blast thru.  And after 6 months, you think about it so rarely, it's almost as if you never smoked at all.  

I quit on August 4th, and I was scared shitless on August 3rd, so I'm here to tell you it's a doable thing.  I feel great on a physical level and quite liberated on other levels.

So good luck wherever you are, stand by your decision to quit, it is a great one.

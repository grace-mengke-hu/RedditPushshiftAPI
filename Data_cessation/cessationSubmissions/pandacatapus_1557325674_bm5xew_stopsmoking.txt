Nervous about this coming weekend

I’m starting to feel a little nervous for what’s coming this weekend. My best friend is coming into town and she’s still a smoker. We definitely have habits around each other and smoking. One time when she was quitting, I went and visited her while I was still smoking and triggered her and now I’m nervous for it to be me that feels triggered. I also know that we are probably gonna have a drink or two and alcohol also triggers my cravings, but I have the strength to just not drink around her or the rest of my friends though. 

Then on Sunday it’s Mother’s Day and both my parents still smoke so I am nervous to go see them and feel triggered as well!!! 

This is going to be a challenging weekend. I’m one week no smoking today and that feels great. But I’m definitely having the cigarette dreams now and it sucks.

Day 9 and I gotta reset again

Well we r making progress....  made it passed 7 days without smoking.... now we need to make it passed 9 days without smoking.... dont ask me y I'm doing this to myself, I dont know when I'll get it through my skull that enough is enough.... I'm not even really craving like before. It's just a simple thought that 1 would be nice.... I dont think I'm ready to just give it up completely.... I just keep going 1 goal at a time. 1 day at a time exceeding my last goal

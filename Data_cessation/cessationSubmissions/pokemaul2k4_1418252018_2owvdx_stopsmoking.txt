first time redditor who has decided enough is enough with smoking. would gladly appreciate any support/tips

just a little background on myself. Been smoking since high school (age of 17) and now im 24 and have decided that I NEED TO QUIT because I now have a daughter and I want to be healthy to be able to see everything she will accomplish in life as a healthy dad. also i grew up where my mom smoked and my dad smoked. so i have been around it quite a bit in my life. So reddit please post any tips or suggestions as to how to quit that you have found helpful in your experience. thanks!

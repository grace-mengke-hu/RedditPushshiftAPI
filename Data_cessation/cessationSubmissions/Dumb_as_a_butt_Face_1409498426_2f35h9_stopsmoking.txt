Three thoughts after two weeks...

1. Because your brain is so trained to find stress-relief/happiness/relaxation (or the illusion of them) externally, you really need a replacement for smoking. A lot of people talk about carrot sticks, there are other less healthy ones (e-cigs, hard candy, whatever). I really believe that since the happiness power of cigarettes is all mental, that power can be transferred to whatever. I've hammered on it a few times here, but GREEN TEA IS THE STELLAR. Seriously, a little caffeine, keeps your regular, has antioxidant and detoxing powers. I drank a cup whenever I had a craving, and I swear it solved the problem. The days I didn't were my worst days. It's not science, obviously, but I am totally convinced that was my magic bullet. 

2. Quitting smoking is like giving a kid a shot. Before it happens, the more you talk about it, prepare, tense up, watch it coming, the worse its going to be. I picked a random Monday, quit on a whim, almost just to see if I could, and here I am. Screw quit dates.

3. Quitting smoking is like jumping in a cold pool. It sounds way worse than it is. All the other times I thought about quitting, I would get soooooo sad. It was devastating to think I wouldn't have another cigarette again. But that was the nicotine, of course. Now that I'm in the water, it's cold, and I shivered a little, for sure, but now it's soooooo refreshing. The anticipation was way worse than the action.

Edit for context: I was a sixteen year, half pack a day smoker, started at 18 years old.

Less than a day in and I feel hopeless

I am less than a day in to quitting smoking, 4 hours to be exact, and I'm feeling like I can't do this. 
I haven't stopped craving a smoke. Normally I would only have had one by this time but for some reason my mind is telling me I need to be chain smoking. 

When I have a craving I chug a glass of water, but I can only do that so many times. 

I just needed to tell someone.

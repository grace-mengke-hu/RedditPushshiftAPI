How do you encourage someone to quit?

I've been with my s\o for nearly 6 years. We started the relationship under the pretense that neither of us were smokers but I found out 2 years ago she's been non stop smoking since she was 18. She promised shed quit but she never did. She lives with a roommate that chain smokes and buys her cigarettes and I can't feel like that encourages it.

Both my parents have always smoked and the smell revolts me, it literallt makes me want to gag. Beyond that there's a large age difference between us and all that goes through my mind when she lights up is that there's a good chance shell be dead by the time I hit 40 (I'm 21). Anytime I try to tell her anything like that she gets super defensive and tells me stuff like "mind your own business" and "plenty of smokers live until 90".

Am I wrong in being concerned? If I am, why? And if not how can I do annything to try and get her to quit? I don't want to break up with her because of her smoking but I feel like a long term relationship between a heavy smoker and someone who hates it is just doomed to fail.

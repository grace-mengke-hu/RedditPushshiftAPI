My experience quitting so far.

Hello Everyone,

I just wanted to give you my take on stopping the smoking.  I have been a smoker for well over 15 years and this previous Monday While I was having one I stopped and said to myself it is time.  I went out after work got myself an E-Cigarette called the eGo-T and it is helping me so much. My nicotine dose on it is JUST enough for me to get by and the only effects I had from quitting real butts was trouble sleeping on day 2 and sweating very much at work on day 3.  Now about to roll into day 4 and I feel great.

Anyone can do it, you just need to find a way that works for you.  For me it was the E-Cig.  You have nothing to lose so just keep it up and you will eventually get there! Good Luck to you all!

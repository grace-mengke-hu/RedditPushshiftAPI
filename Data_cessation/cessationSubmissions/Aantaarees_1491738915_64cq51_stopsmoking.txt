One month and a week, why am I still tempted?

Hi! 

A month and a week ago I quited cold turkey, I was having bronchitis and told my self:
"who am I kidding, this is not a good combination, I am cheating myself alone"

Long story short I am still tempted to smoke, mostly during the afternoon, peaking when the night comes in. I start feeling warm, angry and irritated.

I don't understand how is that possible after more than a month!!

OK, maybe what triggers me is that I started smoking (years ago) to feel less alone, I actually came back to college a week ago, and started to feel alone again. Still I wonder if it is not something else..

When did your cravings went away?

I am also considering purchasing a herbal vaporizer to "smoke" or "vape" chamomile. When I was into tobacco i would put a bit of that herb in rolled cigarettes and it was very soothing, so maybe it could calm my afternoon-irritability. 

thanks for your input!

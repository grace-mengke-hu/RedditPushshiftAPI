Quitting and not killing your partner

Has anybody else quit with their partner? My boyfriend and I use to smoke $1600 a month, we just set our rent on fire every day. He was a pack a day smoker, I was a half a day smoker and he is finding it easier to quit than I am. 
This makes me want to kill him. 
Today I am STRUGGLING. I’ve cleaned up, taken a nap, showered, read a book, called a friend, chewed gum and had another shower but I am holding myself back from going and buying a pack because really i don’t want to smoke, I don’t want hell week again. If I were to buy them we’d both smoke the pack tonight and go back to day dot tomorrow, but we don’t want that, if I fail he fails and that’s not fair. Any tips out there? I basically came here to try and get through this strong craving and remind myself it’s worth it, the anxiety and stress will pass after the first month.

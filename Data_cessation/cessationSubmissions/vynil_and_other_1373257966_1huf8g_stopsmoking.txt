Does standing with a smoker and inhaling 2nd hand smoke count?

So my co-worker just invited me out for a cig. I declined as ' i have given them up ' but as a test for myself I went out with him. I just stood with my coffee while he had a smoke.

I was in a bit of a trance with all that lovely smoke wafting around me. It smelt lovely. I didn't smoke one but the smell kinda relaxed me a bit...

Do I need to reset my badge now?

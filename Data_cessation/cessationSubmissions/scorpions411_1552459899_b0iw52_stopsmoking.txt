It's been two weeks. Sleep is everything but restful.

Hi there. It's been two weeks since my journey started after smoking for 15 years and it feels great if it weren't for those short nights. I go to sleep very late and wake up very early. Usually it's not even 4 hour sleep. I don't eat much sugar ( but I do eat late).  I go on long walks daily. About 2-4 miles. (But I don't do sport). I only drink two cups of coffee in the morning and a cup of black tea in the afternoon. I do sit a lot in front of my computer but I use apps to warm up the colors and brightness of my screens.
How long did it take for you ?

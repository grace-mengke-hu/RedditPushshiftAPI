So now we zero the clock.

Here I am again, back to take another stab at doing this thing. I used the community in the past and had decent success with it. But as my favorite movie character Richard B. Riddick said "I lost a step. I got sloppy. Dulled my own edge." It happens and now I'm back again to zero the clock. Start fresh and find that passion I once had to kick this habit once and for all. To start rebuilding myself in all facets of what I believe makes a person whole. Mind, body, and spirit. I will be here regularly quasi blogging the trials and troubles I have rebuilding this aspect of my life again. My goals here are as follows...

1.  Rebuild my financial standing. I have found that I stress about money and it goes without saying that when I am stressed I turn to the one thing that provided me comfort. That ends now with the help of a program called [YNAB](https://www.youneedabudget.com/).

1. I smoked my last cigarette today. No longer will I allow this filthy habit get in the way of my health any longer.

1. Tomorrow after work I will go back to the gym. Even if it is just to lift the bar I am going. No more excuses.

1. I will begin a meditation routine. Even if it is just for a few minutes at the start I will start practicing again to help my over all disposition and reflect on the progress I have made.

1. Lastly I will rediscover the things that I once enjoyed again. Gaming, reading, movies, you name it I'm gonna go do it. I lost a lot of time just sitting outside having a smoke and its time I get that personal time back.

From past experience I know the next couple of days are gonna be the hardest. But I know also that I am not alone. Just looking at the new comers to this subreddit I know I do not walk this path alone. Mistakes will be made, and if you all will allow me to indulge my nerdy side just one more time, but "We fall so we can learn to pick ourselves back up again." So hello /r/stopsmoking I'm back and this time I aim to make it stick.

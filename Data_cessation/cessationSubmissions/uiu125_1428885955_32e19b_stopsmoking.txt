Quick Self-congratulation // Thanks to Stop-smokers

(First, I apologize if anything I say is oft-repeated/'obvious' stuff)

I just wanted to firstly, sorta, brag about my 4 weeks! I'm so glad I've got this far considering since January I've been dealing with my mental health issues for the first time for 5 years. Not only that, but I'm keeping my cravings to carry on drinking everyday under wraps too - the reason I smoked anyway. I say this too, as a way of saying you don't have to believe yourself when you say you can't quit because of other things - something I kept telling myself before I quit, and thankfully got support from SS. This group really does help, so thankyou all. As a kind fellow stop-smoker said to me, which I've kept telling myself all along, 'it's a crutch, but it isn't holding you up.'

Sorta another topic, I've found myself to be a huge sucker for retraining my brain. (This is where my apology comes in - sorry if the topic's been beaten to death in here). But yeah, I just keep identifying my big craving points, and try and trick myself into new habits. After every meal now, instead of smoking, I just pick at raisins for a while, keeping my hands busy. Instead of that pre-bed cig, I took up jogging the past week or so, making me tired and just feel good about myself.

Like I said, sorry if this is repetitive, braggy, or sounds like I'm being narcissistic, I'm just hoping it could offer someone a ray of hope, as the group did me. Much love SS.

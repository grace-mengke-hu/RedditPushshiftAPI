Side effects of patches?

So I'm 31 and have been smoking for almost 3 years now. Never bought a pack of cigarettes in my life until it became a habit, and for obvious reasons I'd like to stop. 

I told someone at work that I was thinking about using nicotine patches to quit, and that person went on to say that their ex developed suicidal thoughts and nightmares when they used a patch. 

My question is: is this an actual thing I should be worried about? I've discovered I don't have the self discipline to quit on my own, as I always make up an excuse to buy another pack. Is there another way that isn't quitting cold turkey?

Thanks for any advice.

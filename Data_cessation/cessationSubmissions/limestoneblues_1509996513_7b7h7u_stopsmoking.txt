The Patch. I tried using the patch this weekend and while i didnt smoke for 24 hours i nearly lost my mind.

I gave it a shot and it didn't work out. 

I've been smoking for such a long time it's hard to imagine life without constantly stopping for a smoke. 

I think the patch was way to strong for me. I did have weak cravings for a smoke , but I could barely think clearly. 

Anyone have success using the patch to quit smoking?

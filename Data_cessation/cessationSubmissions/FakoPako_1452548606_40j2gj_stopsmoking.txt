Here is what is helping me a lot

One of the things that I believe makes it lot easier for me to not think about smoking and actually wanting to smoke is, that I totally changed my day and routine. Actually, my routine sucked before. I was lazy, always tired, didn't do crap. Always dragged to do stuff that needed to be done. 

I changed it all completely, especially things that would be connected with smoking. For example, I stopped a routine of stopping at gas station every morning for redbull and smokes. It was my routine...smoke and a redbull. No more. Now that one thing is out of the equation (redbull) another one feels "weird".

Started to work out. Everyday, after work. Not only that it makes me feel damn good, it also makes me not want to suck on cigarettes. Who the hell wants to smoke after they can barely breathe after workout!

I started to eat healthy and track everything in My Fitness Pal. 

Started to drink tons of water...and I mean, TONS!

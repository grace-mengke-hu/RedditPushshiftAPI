First time in 10 years since I have not smoked a cigarette in the morning.

Last night I decided to quit cold turkey.
I smoked my last cigarette and went to bed. I woke up 3 hours ago, and I feel so much better. I used to wake up and instantly smoke a cigarette with my coffee 5 mins after waking up.

This is the first time in 10 years that I have not smoked a cigarette the moment I woke up.

I feel different. I dont know how to explain it.

Only 3 hours have passed since I woke up but I do feel a huge different. I stepped outside and can actually smell the fresh air, its a weird sensation. Hard to describe.

The reason i chose to quit was due to lack of energy. I noticed I stopped doing things. I run out of breath easily walking up the stairs and I want my old body and energy back.

Wish me luck.

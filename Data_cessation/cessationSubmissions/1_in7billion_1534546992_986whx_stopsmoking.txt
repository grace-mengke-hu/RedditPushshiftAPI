26 days in. I’ve been smoking since I was 16 so 20 years and this is the longest I’ve ever been without a cigarette. I am vaping but slowly dropping the nicotine down. I started at 20 then 16 now 11. Planning to drop to 8 at the end of September.

I honestly never thought I would manage it having tried since March and only managed to make a day even with the vape.  I lost 5 stone last year and became a dance fitness instructor. Smoking was the next thing on my list. I can honestly say I’ve had almost zero cravings. 

I don’t want a cigarette, which is awesome. I know I’m still replacing the nicotine but find it odd that I don’t want one. Anyone else had this? I’m also fine with people smoking around me.

I relapsed after 10 days, so now I'm starting over.

I quit smoking on March 11th and on Friday afternoon I became so stressed that I thought it was a good Idea to buys cigarettes. Let me say this after 3 days of smoking again I feel like crap. I decided I'm quitting again tonight! Let me remind the people who are just quitting to learn from me IT IS NOT WORTH IT!!! It did nothing for me, but make me feel like crap again.

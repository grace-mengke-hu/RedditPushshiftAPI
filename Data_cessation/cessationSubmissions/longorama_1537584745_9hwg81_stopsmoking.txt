Bet my Facebook friends that I wouldn't have a butt in September (proceeds to charity) Day 21!!!

Couoldn't quit on my own so figured I'd put on the pressure by doing it for charity. I told my facebook friends that if I smoked a smoke in September, I'd donate 300$ to the Canadian Cancer Society. If I could go the whole month without a puff, we would donate what they "bet me" (pledged). 21 days in 425 raised. thousands pledged.  9 days to go!!!

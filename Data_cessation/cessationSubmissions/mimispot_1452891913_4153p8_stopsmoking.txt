My skin is actually less wrinkly!!!

It's been only seven days but I could see it in the mirror just now. You know when you raise your eyebrows and the skin between the eyebrows and the hairline folds? My skin doesn't do that anymore! That's amazing!!! I think this quitting smoking thing is actually reversing the negative effects smoking had on my skin!

Today i will not smoke, i've done it once and i'll do it again!

3 months ago i started smoking again. before that i quit for almost 14 months.

You notice it so much, the coughing the smell the out of breathness, all that in 3 months.

i'ts going to be hard the next couple of days i will be miserable but i have to do it.

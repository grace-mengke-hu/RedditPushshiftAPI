Sorta stopped smoking by accident.

I work almost every day.  I had a glorious four days off.  I didn't do anything but stay in my house being a large veggy.  I had two packs of smokes which was fine for day one and two.  Day three came and I just couldn't stand the idea of going out for anything.  So I didn't smoke day three or four.  Back to work and I end up getting sick.  So truthfully I wasn't up to doing anything but sleeping for two days.  Day five of not smoking comes around and I stop at a gas station to get gas and a soda and decide what the he'll I had gone four days and had not smoke, so I would just keep not smoking.  It has now been twenty days and I still haven't smoked.  
  Truthfully got to admit I miss it most right after supper and while watching television before bed.  I have to remind myself that nope you quit.  I really never realized that whenever someone on television would light up one, I would too.  I hate to see a smoker on television right now, except for then I am doing okay.
 I have realized how I would have to rewash all my clothes that hung up since I wore something from my walk in closet and I could smell smoke on the clothes.  I have febreezed every soft surface in my house and think I might get a carpet shampooer to do my carpets.  I really wish I had never smoked in my apartment now.

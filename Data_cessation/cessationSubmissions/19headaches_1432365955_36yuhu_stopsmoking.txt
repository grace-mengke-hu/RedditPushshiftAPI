Will I always miss smoking?

So I quit last November, and I really miss smoking. Sometimes I remember that taste of lighting a fresh cig and my mouth starts to water, Ill start craving one bad. I've always ignored it but it comes back the next day, or sometimes even just a couple of hours later. 

I almost caved in and got a pack of Djarums (yeah, yeah whatever, they're tasty OK?) and it took every fiber of my being to not get in my car and drive up to the convenience store and buy a pack. I'm only 23 and don't want to deal with this later in life, but it's so damn tempting. I smoke hookah sometimes at a friends house, could this be contributing?

Thanks in advance

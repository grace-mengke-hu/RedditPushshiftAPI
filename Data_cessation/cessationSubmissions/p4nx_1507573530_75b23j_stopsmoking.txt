I'm used to get the first day for free with a hangover, but since I don't drink anymore I somehow have to through that first day

Greetings,


my (ultra special and secret) trick of quitting smoking is to get completely smashed the day before, so you got a bad hangover the next day. You won't want a smoke the whole day (okay, maybe in the evening, but it's not that hard) so you can directly start with day two.


With the use of this trick I stayed smokefree in the past ranging from a few days, to a few weeks, to finally 5 years (yeah, and then I started again - another story)


The problem is now that I don't drink anymore, so I've got to suffer through the first day like normal people.


Sadly with not much success. For example today I didn't smoke the whole workday, I hyped myself up in the morning with Allen Carr quotes and it wasn't bad, but in the later afternoon, after work I did buy a pack anyways.


I'd love to lock myself up in the apartment under advisory of my fiancee if I had a few free days left - sadly I don't. Mo - Sa I'm at work, ready to fuck things up.

Day 0

I had my last cigarette today. 

It's scaring the shit out of me. 

After ten years of smoking, using it as a crutch, loving my cigarettes more than anything else in my life, I'm done. I promised myself when I got a job that I'd stop, that I'd leave the habit behind.

So today was my last day. I'm starting with the patches to see if they work. Some help and support (and an app that could help me track) would all be appreciated. I've attempted quitting before, but this is it. This is the one.

I'm going to succeed.

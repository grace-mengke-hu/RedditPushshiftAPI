a little un-kosher, but it has been 30 days

Have managed to not smoke for 30 days. 

I enjoy a few beers on a weekend, and that was the weakness that made me continue to relapse over and over again. 

A friend suggested I buy a pack of Swedish General Snus. I've had the same tin for the whole month, still have half of it left, and have just been putting a pouch under my lip when I get the urge while out drinking.

Although they are bad and no substitute, I have basically stopped using the snus while drinking and have now gone out for a few drinks multiple times this week with no nicotine whatsoever. 

Anyway, health wise I'm feeling great, able to run and exercise again. Would not trade this feeling for the world and have no ambitions to fire up a cigarette anytime soon.

Open to criticism, but just thought I'd share my story.

Hope the rest of you out there are coping with your quit missions.

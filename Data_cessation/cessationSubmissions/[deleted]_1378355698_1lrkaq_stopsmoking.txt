Strongest urge yet.

Hello. Yesterday I had an expected but powerful stressor in my life, in the form of a phone call. I didn't sleep well that night/day, felt the urge to smoke many times (5-6), and completely ignored my routine of exercising/running I've developed over the past few days. 

I want to know how I can be less reactive to external stresses. I mean this one phone call has put me back so much, I don't want anyone or anything to have so much control over me. Thanks.

I've decided to stop smoking [Update]

Update from [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/6mlrw0/ive_decided_to_stop_smoking/)

A little over two weeks ago I started a 25 day plan to stop smoking. The plan goes as follows:

Days 1-4: 10 100s per day
Days 5-8: 10 shorts per day
Days 9-12: 5 100s per day
Days 13-16: 5 shorts per day
Days 17-20: 3 shorts per day
Days 21-24: 2 shorts per day
Days 25: smoke free

Today is day 17. It's taken a bit more effort than I thought it would, but I've been able to stick to the plan so far so I'm feeling decently confident heading into the home stretch. Still nervous about what's going to happen on day 25, but I'm determined to kick this drug. 

Hopefully all goes well and I'm smoke free in 8 days. I'll make a post either way so wish me luck and I'll see you on day 25. Thanks for listening!

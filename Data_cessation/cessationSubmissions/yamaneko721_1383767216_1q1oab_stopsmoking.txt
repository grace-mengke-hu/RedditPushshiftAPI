Quitting smoking for the millionth time.

I've tried to quit smoking many many times in the past.  I'm 28, and I've smoked for about 8 years.  For the past few years, I smoke a little over a pack of cigarettes each day.

I've stopped smoking for over a week about 15 different times.  I've gone more than two weeks about five or six times.  But I always end up smoking again, and I'm back to smoking a pack to a pack and a half each day almost immediately.

So here goes another attempt.  I am confident that I will get past the physical withdrawal of cigarettes, and the worst week or so.  But my challenge is the psychological pulls that pop up when things start to smooth out a little and catch me off guard.

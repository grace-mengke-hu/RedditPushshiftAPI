100 Cigarettes Skipped

Last cigarette was right before midnight on Sunday the 9th.... So I'm between 12 and 13 days.  I've tried to quit before, and even made it months... But this is this first time I've been really serious about it.  It's been both easier and harder than I anticipated.  I'm getting through my trigger activities (mainly, driving, which I can't avoid) better than I thought.  But the sleep and mood issues have been worse than I thought... I actually might have gotten myself into some fairly serious trouble at work because of my bad attitude. I'm also feeling sadder than I thought I would.  I know this needs to be forever and I wish I had savored my last cigarette better, or maybe smoked a couple extra that last day.  I know that is insane but whatever.

Other notables: I still haven't told anyone.  My colleagues didn't know (it didn't acknowledge) that I smoked in the first place; and I've been laying low so I haven't seen my family or two closest friends.  I don't want to jinx myself OR look like a failure if I start again... But at this point, maybe it's time.  Maybe it will help hold me accountable?  I'm definitely one of those people who tells everyone I'm going to do something and then fail miserably, so I'm really on the fence.  Also I CANNOT stop eating. Three nights in a row I ate take out for two all by myself.

Anyway, this place has been super helpful so far, so.... Thanks guys.  :)

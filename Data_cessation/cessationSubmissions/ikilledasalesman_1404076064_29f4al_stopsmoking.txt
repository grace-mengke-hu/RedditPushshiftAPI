Second go.

I'm really young (20) compared to lots of the redditors here, so I'm sure many, many others are going/have gone through a much tougher ordeal than I will, but I recently discovered this sub so I thought it could be a big inspiration reading success stories.


Started smoking at 14. In my country, being younger than 18, you'd get fined for smoking cigarettes if you get caught. I had to pay about $64 US dollars after getting caught twice, looking back I can't seem to think why it didn't deter me to stop. I tried stopping only once so far after starting a full time job but being in an office 3/4 full of smokers made it virtually impossible. Working in the service industry now, and decided to give it a go one more time next Monday. I lasted only about 3 or 4 days the last time round before I stole a cigarette from my brother, I felt incredibly guilty but didn't stop after that. Really hoping I can do it this time

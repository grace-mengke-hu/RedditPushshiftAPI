Hello guys! I'm 19 and need help to WANT to stop smoking.

I've been smoking for 2 years now, about 1 pack every week. I started because I wanted to, but I realize that smoking is bad for me.  
The thing is, I don't really want to stop smoking. I love it so much! The feeling of waking up to that first cig of the day, and the smoking marathon at night while watching Netflix is just amazing. I haven't had a cigarette in 3 days now, but I don't know if I will keep going. Can you help me to stop smoking?

What to do about concentration issues?

Hi all, you might remember me from a post I made bragging about my decision to quit. Anyways, the next day I was right back at it. 
Just looking at the things that have always led me to relapse, one of the strongest issues I had was with concentrating. Without smoking, I find it’s a constant battle with mind-fog. Like, hard to read, hard to keep my mind on one subject.
I’m ADD, and was on Ritalin throughout high school, but have been off of it for six years now. 
Anyone who found concentration to be a big issue, how did you deal with it? What did you find helped? 
Thanks all. Hopefully I’ll be joining the nicotine free crowd within the next two weeks. 
Peace!

I did it! Booze + Smokers = Still Smoke Free!

Day 4, no biggy yet versus your numbers but I thought I'd stick to my daily routine and wants outside of smoking. Decided to head out with the lads tonight for beers and lo and behold 7 hours later, here I am (a lil sobered up from this) still smoke free!

I've seen a few here saying they're fearful of heading out and continuing with their lives whilst in the early stages of quitting. It's all in you! I've had a couple of crave (beer was fantastically barley-ish) but those lasted for as long as it took for my brains to say not worth it. 

You guys got this, it's in you and it's only you who decides! Party on!

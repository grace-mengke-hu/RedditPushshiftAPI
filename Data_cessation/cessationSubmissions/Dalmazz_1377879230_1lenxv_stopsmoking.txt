Hey guys, trying to quit, advice would be appreciated

Hey everyone,  new to this sub, so I sincerely apologize if I've broken any rules, 
But I'll get too it, I'm 17 (I know, shouldn't be smoking etc.) I have 5 left in my current pack, I do still live with my parents,  and it disaapoints them as much as it does myself,  
I've been smoking for 2 years, and I would like nothing more than to quit, it just now seems like a waste of money and of my body, I did have a couple of questions about quitting;
1. What should I do with the smokes I have? Should I use them to ween off, or just throw them?
2. How should I deal with my freinds smoking/offering me one?
3. Is there (in your opinion) a good alternative?  
4. Should I buy an e-cigarette? 

If anyone can help me out, I'd really appreciate it,  you guys are the first people I've come too, mainly because I assume you're going to be the most helpful,  seeing as a lot of you seem to be successful, but mostly because the whole reddit community seems accepting and understanding, any help would be great.

i want to quit so damn bad..

every morning i wake up i regret smoking my first smoke of the day but it's so hard not to. everyday i ask my fiance if we're going to quit soon & he responds "yeah, i really want to quit too".. june 1st is my quit date but that's just a date. i don't think i'm going to be able to quit. when both of us quit at the same time it is absolute hell around here. i'm unemployed and he's at home as well. i can't avoid him, he can't avoid me. if i want to quit it won't last long because he'll still be smoking and then i'll be all pissy and give in and smoke again. it's been like this for a longgggg time. i have zero support and i don't know what to do anymore. i have reasons why i want to be smoke free and so does he but we're not doing anything about it! last month he was away for 9 days and i made it 5 days without smoking until he came back. i feel like an absolute failure and it's eating me up inside. how can one quit when their significant other doesn't even try? how can i quit if i'm surrounded with smoke? i just want to cry because i'm so sick of this. i just want to hibernate for a month and wake up and ex-smoker. i've tried everything (the patch, the gum, the mints, the mist, the inhaler, e-cigs etc.) this time is going to be cold turkey. if i can ever muster up the balls to go through with it. thanks for letting me vent.

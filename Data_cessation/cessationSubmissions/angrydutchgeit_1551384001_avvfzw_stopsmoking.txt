Insurance coverage for smoking cessation products

Hey, guys! I quit smoking 4 years ago. I went cold turkey because the patches and gum made me really sick.

Anyway, my husband \[finally\] decided to quit. He asked me to buy him the gum, which I did, but he didn't like it and decided to go with patches. We all know patches can be expensive. The gum was expensive, too, but I figured insurance wouldn't cover it. I thought patches might be covered.

In my job, I deal with a lot of pharmaceutical and public health information. All commercial insurance plans, including high deductible plans, and all marketplace plans are required to cover some medications under a preventive drugs list. Each plan negotiates its own list, so one person with BCBS through one employer may have coverage for different meds than someone with BCBS through another employer, but they all cover some type of smoking cessation. It's mandated by the Affordable Care Act. 

It turns out that our plan will cover generic gum, generic patches, and probably oral drugs \[which we didn't check\] at 100 percent, no deductible. All we needed was a valid prescription, which my husband's doctor was happy to write without an office visit.  If you want to know whether your insurance covers these items, go to your pharmacy coverage website and enter "nicotine patch" or "nicotine gum" in the part of the website where you can check prices. If you're still not sure, you can call the number on your insurance card and ask. Make sure you call the company that handles your prescription coverage. It may be different from the company that handles your medical coverage. 

Our pharmacy, which is part of a national chain, hadn't seen prescriptions for over the counter smoking cessation products before. If your pharmacy is equally confused, don't panic. Let them know they can bill the patches (or lozenges or gum, whatever is covered) to insurance. They may not know to do that and, like us, you may receive a notice that you have to pay full price before it's all straightened out.

If you have state or federal insurance coverage, like Medicare, Medicaid, or Tricare, I'm not sure what coverage you have for smoking cessation. I know traditional Medicare covers smoking cessation counseling, but I'm not sure about patches and the like.

This is a link to a list of Medicaid coverage for smoking cessation by state. It's from 2014, so it may be out of date, but it might be a good place to start if you're not sure of your coverage.

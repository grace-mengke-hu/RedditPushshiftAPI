My husband got a prescription for Champix today. What advise do you have for me to help him through this?

My husband has been a smoker for roughly the last 12-14 years. He's 32.  I've never been a smoker so its hard for me to fully understand the struggle of quitting, but i've been supporting him as best I can. He's tried to quit in the past with the cold turkey method, and after initial success, went back to smokes. He's also tried switching to the patch, the inhaler, and e-cigaretts, but none of them stuck. Champix is something he has considered deeply for a few years, and today he took the leap.  We want to try to get pregnant in the fall, so he's really trying to quit, and eager for it to work this time.


I understand Champix can be an extremely altering drug. I've heard that it can alter brain chemistry to the point of no return, but I believe thats anecdotal. But, i'm still very scared. 

**Anyone who's been through the Champix quit routine before:** what advise do you have for me to support my husband through this challenge? I want to make this as easy and comfortable as possible for him.

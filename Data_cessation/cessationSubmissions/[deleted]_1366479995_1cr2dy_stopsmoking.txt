Day 2 trying to quit... I'm not good at this.

I have been a smoker for the better part of 10 years and I have quit successfully a few times, but I always seem to go back. Things like bars, road trips, my family and countless other instances that I normally use to smoke always suck me back in. I have been reading the stop smoking posts and it seems like you guys are really supportive and eager to help a quitter quit. I have a couple questions. Ideally I would like to quit cigs, and also cut down on booze, coffee, and sugar, weed and other stuff.. Should I quit everything at once or take it a step at a time? Also how do I avoid the temptation to smoke when I am around friends or drinking? I am sure these have been answered in other posts but I feel like your support may help me win this battle.

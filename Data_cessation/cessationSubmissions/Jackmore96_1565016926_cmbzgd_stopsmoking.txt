Quitting smoking today!

Hi everyone fellow ex-smokers! I'm 23 and i'm from Italy. after a few attempts i've finally decided it was time to end this torture. my smoke-free life starts today; it started precisely 4 hours ago when i smoked the last cigarette of my life.

Smokign was slowly killing me, increasing my social anxiety and absolutely demolishing my good habits. so here i am, this is the time.

Wish me luck, my new life started today

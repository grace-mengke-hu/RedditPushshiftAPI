Not sure how i have made it this far...

Still smoke free...despite being in Khalifa...where I don't want to be...and people smoke here EVERYWHERE and smokes are dirt cheap...and I have no clue how long I will be here...and I regularly have to do shit I am not comfortable with (like ride a man lift to the underside of a crane to adjust lasers and I am terrified of heights)...and my supervisor is an Italian who smokes like a chimney...and for some reason the concept of me quitting confuses him as every time we have to talk he offers me a cig (i honestly think his English is that poor and he wants to be friendly)...oh and I don't have possession of my passport anymore so I am literally stuck here long term...and despite this being a desert country, they have planted so damn many trees that I have had nothing but terrible allergies since I landed...

I dont get it. I have relasped over having to get my oil changed. Forsome reason....despite the near crippling nicotime withdrawl and some of the worse stress I have experienced in near a decade...still smoke free.

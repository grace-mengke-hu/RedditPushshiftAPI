In the "serious game" of quitting smoking, I reached the first Boss Level, Trial By Fire.

Today is Day 4 and I have reached and passed the Boss level, Trial By Fire so far. I went to this setting, the setting being:

A Walmart with several ashtrays, a smoking area and a McDonald's. Normally I smoke like a chimney here. I did NOT smoke One BIT even though I heard Nicodemon boss say "Pssp! Why not"? I just told Nicodemon Boss to go to Hell and stay there.

I told Nicodemon boss that I will NOT cave for ANYTHING. Try harder. He was lazy. Passed the stage with flying colors despite a last ditch effort by the Nicodemon Boss with a partially smoked butt on the ground, which I promptly mashed up with my shoe into little bits.

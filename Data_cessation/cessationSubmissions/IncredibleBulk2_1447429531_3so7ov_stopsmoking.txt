Day 7 and I'm feeling fine!

Holy shit, I'm about to be one week cig free and I'm so happy and I wanted to share my joy. Here are the top 5 things I can do right now that I couldn't a week ago...

1. Smell shit. I love smells. I love the outdoors and I frequently bike to work. Fall doesn't smell as great as spring, but I can smell it more and it is awesome. I stop to smell roses. I put fresh herbs in vases around my house. The smell of my neighbors burning wood, the mustiness of the leaves...it's all making me so happy.

2. Taste my food. I had Indian food for lunch the other day and my Mango Lassi was AMAZING.

3. Hug my boyfriend. Can't kiss him yet because FML I got a cold sore.

4. Not make my office-mate sick. She never said anything, but I know she hated when I would come back from my lunch break smelling like an ash tray.

5. Breathe without wheezing and hacking up lung butter.

Everything is going to be okay. I am a nonsmoker.

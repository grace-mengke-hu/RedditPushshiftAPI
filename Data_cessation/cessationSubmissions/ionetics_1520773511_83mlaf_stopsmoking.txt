Avoiding stealth tobacco in joints

My son introduced his lovely new BF to me for Mother's Day! That meant us all drinking wine, and them accidentally passing me cannabis+tobacco joints. Major, major temptation for me. Despite being tipsy, I managed my "No" mentally rehearsed previously. It was hard though, and I had to walk off a major craving in the other room. I could easily have lied to myself that it wouldn't count, or was in a different 'category' somehow.

But I didn't want to waste my hard-won work- nearly 2 weeks not ingesting tobacco, and a week off all nicotine. The cravings are becoming noticeably less frequent, severe and long-lasting, so I'd have been a fool to cave.

Had a wee hangover this morning, but thanked myself for avoiding re-awakening that evil nicotine monster through the back door.

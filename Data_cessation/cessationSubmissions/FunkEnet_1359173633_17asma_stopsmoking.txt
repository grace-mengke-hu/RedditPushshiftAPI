Can I become a casual smoker? 

I liked the act of smoking, like a lot, pretty much I liked it too much and that is why I'm here. I just wonder since it is my first time actually going a good amount of time not smoking if I can have like 1 cig a month? Most will say no, I accept that but I don't like accepting the fact that cigarettes have that much power over me, that I can't smoke just one. Potato chips are the same way, you need self-control or else you end up eating the entire bag. I guess what I'm trying to get at is that I'd rather have self-control than just systematically deny myself any substance I don't feel like I have control over.

I know a few people that  smoke 1 or 2 cigs a month, I wouldn't mind doing that, but I don't know if it would just devolve into a pack a day habit like I used to do.

2 months in and I almost stopped by the gas station to pick up a pack, instead I came to you people.

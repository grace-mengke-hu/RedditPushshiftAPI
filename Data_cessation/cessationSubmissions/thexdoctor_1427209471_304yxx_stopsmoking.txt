This subreddit has given me the hope I needed

Hello everyone! I posted in here once, on one of my many almost - quit kicks. This time, however, I'm making that final leap. I see all the support and love from this place, and I'm empowered to follow you all through this journey and trial. My mother has MDS, a former of blood cancer. While not caused by smoking (which she did do regularly) I know that I don't want to end up in that position. I've seen what chemo and transfusions have put her through, and I'm making a stand to prevent this happening to me. Walking into work now, but I look forward to a life smoke free and smell full!!

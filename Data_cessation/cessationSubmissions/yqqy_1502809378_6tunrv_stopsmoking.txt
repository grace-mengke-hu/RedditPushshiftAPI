i bought a god damn pack

sooo welp?

i bought a pack today. i smoked two cigs and then gave it away. i was craving like a motherfucker but upon the first puff i didn't really just get the feeling of relief i was expecting and by the second one i was extremely conscious of the smell and then i figured i'm just gonna get rid of it, and i did. what a waste of 6 euros.

i had relapsed several days earlier already and then the smoking experience was more like i had expected it to, and i got a kick out of it. i was also very drunk. i don't think i'm going to pull this shit off if i don't also go sober for the process of quitting smoking, which is 1000% worth it really.

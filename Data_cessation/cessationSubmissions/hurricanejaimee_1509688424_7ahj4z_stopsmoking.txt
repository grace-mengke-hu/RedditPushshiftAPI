Two days till quits....//Smoking in the punk community

Hi, I'm very new to Reddit so bare with me. Anyways, I've been smoking for a year, and was at a pack a day for pretty much all of that. In the last week or so though I've cut it back to a pack every two to three days. 
It's 1:48am on Friday morning. I'm going to Maine this weekend to visit my best friend, who's also a smoker, we'll be drinking, taking long drives, et cetera. So I've made Monday my Quit Day. 
I've always said that I hate that I smoke but I love smoking. Sure, I know that I smell terrible, I'm throwing away money, I'm paying to kill myself, etc. But I fucking love having a cigarette after a meal or with a beer or OUTSIDE A CONCERT. 
So this brings me to my question, I suppose - what do you do to replace the social aspect of smoking? Especially for me who's heavily involved in local punk shows (I work at a venue and at a recording studio and I'm at 2-3 shows a week.) EVERYONE smokes at shows. I spend a lot of time with bands and they all do too. It's great to be able to talk to a new person because you can ask for a light, or spend a few minutes talking to a musician while you're both smoking. So how do you replace that? What's your excuse to mill about and go in and out of the venue and talk to new people?

(Is this too long of a post? I really don't know how Reddit works.)

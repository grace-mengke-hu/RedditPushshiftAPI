Day 18, feeling neurotypical happiness after decades

So, my brother got a degree in medicine today and i felt genuine happiness off an external event, something that hasnt happened in years. I couldnt even feel happy for my own medical degree. I think i have adhd and that cigs influenced me in a weird unique way that doesnt get others. Before, my entire reward mechanisms were based on cigs, but they somehow even made me socially clumsy (ruined my social motovation or something). Now I'm pretty drunk and actually enjoying it. i dont even feel so f'd up as when i was deunk and a chain smoker

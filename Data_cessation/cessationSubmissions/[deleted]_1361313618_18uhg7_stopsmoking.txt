Always smoked, always had good cardio. Only benefit I feel now is saving money.

I grew up smoking, sort of. It wasn't looked down on in my community. We played soccer and ran track often, ate a lot, I was and still am a very active individual. What would it take for me to stop smoking? I ask that question as honestly as I can, because I see commericals and studies that play both sides and in my body, the only difference I feel is that when I take a break from smoking for competitive reasons, I feel like I have more cardio than usual.

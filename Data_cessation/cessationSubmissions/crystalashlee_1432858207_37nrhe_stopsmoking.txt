messages to badgebot and /r/stopsmoking not working for me.

This sub and members have been extremely helpful at keeping me motivated to continue not smoking.
I tried sending a message with my quit date to badgebot but did not get a badge.  Sent two messages to /r/stopsmoking and did not get an answer or a badge.  What could I be doing wrong?

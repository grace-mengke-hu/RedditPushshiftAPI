On the fence

I always said I would give up smoking when I stopped enjoying it or was just doing it for the sake of it.

Well that day was about a week a go... I have cut back to 2 a day (one when I leave for work in the morning and one after dinner).

I feel like I should quit but I am very much 6 one way and half a dozen the other.

Was kinda just looking for supportive ideas. I don't know.

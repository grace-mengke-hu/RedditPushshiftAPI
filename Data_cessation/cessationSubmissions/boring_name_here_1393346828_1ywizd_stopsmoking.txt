Couple weeks ago, walking in to work, dreading the day...

..and I look at QuitNow app, just to remind myself that I can get through the bullshit, and the next 9 hours of my life, to see this:

It was pure dumb luck I looked at my phone that instant, to see those numbers. I stopped mid-stride, screenshotted it, smiled and kept going. It was a good day.

I can't count how many times I tried quitting before October 3rd. I kept slipping, kept falling, and stayed down for some time, then I got back up and tried again. And again. And again. For anybody in their first few days, weeks, or month, it gets easier. Just keep trying, keep going.

Hopefully this can be a bit of motivation for some of you. So good luck and carry on.

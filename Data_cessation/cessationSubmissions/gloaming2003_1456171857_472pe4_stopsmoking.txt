Two days down

I'm just shy of 48 hours quit. I'm using the patch, and surprisingly the cravings are fairly mild. The 30+ cigarettes a day I was smoking aren't coming back to haunt me. So far this has been a fairly easy quit. Helps that I can stay home and there aren't any stressful situations on the horizon. 

My main problem is the insomnia. I have severe chronic insomnia as it is, and this is making it much worse. Probably got three hours last night, in 45-minute chunks. If I can beat this, though, I've got it made!

Wellbutrin, anyone have success?

Good Evening All,

Ive quit a few times, using different methods, but this past year I have yet to be able to quit again. Its driving me absolutely insane.

My Doctor recommended I try Wellbutrin (Bupropion).

I've pretty much exhausted my brain reading about it online. Now I just need to decide if its worth trying or not. I cant seem to make a decision.

I was hoping to hear from anyone who has had success with it. Or even hear from anyone who has tried it, good or bad.

Thank you very much, I appreciate all your advice and opinions.

Hey, it's day 4 here.

I had to reset. The 300 whatever days is about two quits ago this year. This past summer I made it three weeks, and this time I am on day 4 but it is about 4000x worse than the last quit. I have only gotten about 3 hours of sleep a night and I pretty literally want to kill myself. I want a cigarette so fucking bad even though my rational self tells me it is what is causing this stupid fucking pain.

Thanks for letting me vent. By the way, that was more of a stream of consciousness more than anything. Not actually gonna kill myself; so no worries, except I am worried I will cave on smoking.

Again, downfall on day 4.

Just venting here. Two hours before I hit the end of day 4, I let the  voice win again. I KNOW what I need to do. I come here and read wonderful suggestions and tips and mental tricks and LOVE all the positive support. 

I repeat, mostly for my own good- I KNOW WHAT I NEED TO DO. NOW I JIST HAE TO DO IT.

Thanks, r/stopsmoking for being a venting place.

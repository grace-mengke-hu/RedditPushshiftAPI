5 days, I got this!

I quit up to 50 days a few months ago but relapsed and did drugs (and when I do those I have to smoke). So I realized I can't do any drugs at all. Anyways, I failed on and off but finally made it about a week before I started again due to stress and honestly just missing having a "vice", but when I smoked holy shit it tasted like shit! I had to drive across country and so I bought a pack to keep me busy, but I literally did not enjoy the first 15 cigarettes at all, because my body was not used to the nicotine! 

It's just crazy to me how you get used to the taste and it only tastes good AFTER you are addicted. But when you get past that 3 day hurdle (how long it takes for nicotine to completely leave your body) and you smoke, you realize holy shit, smoking really does taste like complete shit.

And then yesterday during thanksgiving a relative sat by me after smoking, and by god she smelled like ass.

I am so fucking done with that smoking shit, *so* fucking done.

I want to buy a pack

It just kinda came up, been going strong for a while now, but I blew stuff with a girl.  I know what I did wrong and even with a short fling it seems hard to rebound quickly and just start looking for someone new.  I know I am getting better at it, this was just like 10 days ago and I feel like I'm wasting time and I woke up this morning on my day off and my brain has so much time to think.  

So I basically just want to smoke so my brain will shut up about it.  The psychological equivalent of, "I can't have that, so at least let me have that." Even though I know I should exercise, meditate, or look at some positives.  I do know from the challenge of quitting cigarettes that whatever I put my focus on, I can achieve. So, I can make it through today too.  
 
I just happen to want a pack.  So on day 599, I do battle.

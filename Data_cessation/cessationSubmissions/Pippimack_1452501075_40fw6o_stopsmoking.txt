Smoking and MDMA.

I stopped smoking a few weeks ago and I love it - everything about it. However, there's one thing in the back of my mind that it making me feel uneasy.

Every couple of months or so I'll do MDMA with friends and I used to LOVE smoking cigarettes when rolling. I quit using the Alan Carr Method and he (rightly) talks about how few cigarettes are actually memorable or enjoyable. Almost no cigarettes were truly enjoyable... apart from the ones smoked when rolling. The taste, the sensation, the smell, watching the smoke, the whole sense of wellbeing... It enhances the roll and I've never rolled without smoking.

I'm also worried that I'll just not give a shit once I've dropped and just smoke without any feelings of guilt or disappointment.

Perhaps I'm just telling myself that I'll not enjoy the roll without smoking, like some people believe that they can never enjoy a night out drinking again without cigarettes. But has anyone else quit smoking and continued to do MDMA... and how did you get through that first time and prove to yourself that you can enjoy it without smoking.

Questions from a depressed non-smoker that binge smoked over the weekend

So I think I must have smoked at least 20 cigarettes over the weekend due to stress and peer pressure. Starting to feel depressed and empty. Anyone have any idea how long it will take for my dopamine levels to normalize? Any tips for not getting sucked into this habit?

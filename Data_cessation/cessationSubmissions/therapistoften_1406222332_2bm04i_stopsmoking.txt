That's it. I'm quitting today.

I'm sick of this. I'm sick of this itchy throat, I'm sick of my car having ash in the back seat because it falls off before i get it fully out the window, I'm sick of waking up coughing and thinking a cigarette will help, I'm tired of smelling like smoke and being self conscious of the people around me judging me. I'm only 20, and I've been smoking for 6 and a half years. I can't do this anymore; I just had my last cigarette. It tasted like shit.



I need help.

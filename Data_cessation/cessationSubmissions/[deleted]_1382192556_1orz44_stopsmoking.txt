How to handle smoking friends?

Being the only one in the group that has quit is tough. Anyone have this same problem?  I'd like to get everyone to join in the quit but that's not going to happen and I don't want to preach so I gave up.  But, pretty much all the time these guys are constantly smoking and I'm the odd man out.  The 2nd hand smoke really gets to me now and I can smell the clothing stink and hellish breath so much more now...   Just wondering how you guys may have handled the same/similar type of situation.  

I'm over a month now which feels great... I have to thank the sub which helped much more than I though it would.

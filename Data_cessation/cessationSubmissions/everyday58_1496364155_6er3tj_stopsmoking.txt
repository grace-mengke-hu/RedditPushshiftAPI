What has your side effects been?

I'm six days into my quit and so far I've been somewhat hyper. I've been sipping on juice throughout the day to ward off any drop in blood sugar. 

I've developed a sore throat and aching chest since I quit. That's been a surprise. Hope it's a sign of healing. 

My sense of smell has definitely improved. Sorry to my friends who still smoke, the after smoke just stings my eyes. 

What else...

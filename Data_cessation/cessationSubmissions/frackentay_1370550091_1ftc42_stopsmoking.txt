Advice for quitting?

I want this to be my last pack! I've said this a lot lately, but I had also quit my anxiety meds a few months back due to insurance reasons, and I was a miserable asshole when I tried. :P

Anyway, I got them back last night and I want to try to get the two to overlap--quit smoking and have something to calm me down at the same time. Any advice for a quitter with anxiety?

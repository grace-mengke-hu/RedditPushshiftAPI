Day 54

Adjectives of the day not necessarily related to smoking: frightened, panicked, tired, painful, worried, discontented.

The details aren't important. Those are the feelings and I still won't smoke. Because smoking won't make it better.

I hope things are better by noon Saturday. They either will be, or I will need a pep talk and a new perspective!

Either way, I won't smoke. 

I hope I feel good enough to run tomorrow, because that would really help out the situation!

Early night.

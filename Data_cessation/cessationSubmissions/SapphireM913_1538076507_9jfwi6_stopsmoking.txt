Day 2 Patch Free

Didn't get a ton of advice or comments on what to expect when stepping off patches, so I'm posting this in hopes it helps someone in the future. Yesterday, I barely noticed anything was missing. Couldn't focus, but I have good/bad days on that in general, so it was not necessarily due to patch removal. I tried everything all at once for sleep, lavender essential oil, calming scented spray on my sheets, I did a yoga class that day, I masturbated a couple times, I took two of my prescription meds that will get me to sleep (prescribed for anxiety, bonus side effect of sleep), which is the max dosage I can take in a day if needed. I got to sleep in a reasonable time frame and slept through the night. 

Today: headache. Much headache, it started last night, it's getting old fast. Tired, lethargic. Foggy, but nothing like when I did cold turkey. Just like "I probably could've done with another couple hours of sleep" fog. Slightly crabby, nothing like the previous rage that I've felt, and was expecting. Tomorrow is Day 3, which is when it all actually leaves my body, so holding on tight, I'm almost there.

Quitting Poem

10 a day since I was sixteen,
My bloodstream far from pure and clean.
My heart beats fast when tasting death,
As I freeze hell with satans breath.
They say you kill, no news to me.
Why should I care, you set me free.
From boredom born of plastic rules,
From childish masks on evil fools.
You mean me harm, despite the thrill,
My rabid love, you must be killed.
It's been good fun, I have to say,
No use old friend, we must part ways.
So now I'll go for my "last" smoke,
I've tried so often it's a joke,
May the gods give me strength,
To endure and maintain,
So I may never smoke again.

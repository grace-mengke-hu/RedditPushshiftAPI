How to stop falling for my own mind tricks? Don't read if you're urging.

This is serious question, not a guide. I've only recently started to teach myself discipline. I'm 23 and it's pathetic, but I never had anyone who'd taught me and it's been an excuse for far too long. 

But after a short introduction I'll go straight into question. I keep falling for my own tricks. I couldn't quit cold turkey and when i've quit with medication I relapsed after 3-4 months of not smoking. This is my 4th time trying to quit this nasty addiction and i keep fooling myself. I buy another pack in middle of current to feel like i've only smoked 10 not 20 a day. I keep hiding packs with 2-3 cigs left and I try to take only 3 to work, but i will just buy another, if it's not enough. I have very addictive personality and it's hard to change my life, but this community and others are huge help and I hope to seek some guidance in my problem.

Why am I not coughing anything up?

I've been a smoker for 6 months at about half a pack each day. Last week I got the flu and I decided to stop smoking during that time period. Lo and behold, a few days in, I made the decision to quit smoking entirely. However, after a few days, I can barely seem to cough anything up. If I do manage to cough anything up, it's only after an exhausting half hour session of me leaning forward and huffing as much as I can. Only a little comes up then, and my lungs hurt quite a bit. Is it normal to not be coughing anything up after 3 days without a cigarette? It's not a case of not having the urge to cough. I have been having many coughing fits, but the phlegm just seems to gurgle in my chest and never makes it out of my throat

First day.

Hello everyone. I don't know if i'm able to last even half of a day, but i will try, wish me strength of will and if you have tips please tell me, i think maybe e-cigs should help but it's just a replacement one bad habit for another, i want to quit cold turkey, alongside with some other bad habits, should i start some sports/phys. activity/working out/meditation ? What helps, maybe tea or coffee ? I smoke about 30-40 cigs a day and quitted about half a year ago but i could not last longer than a week. It is stupid but i just smoked 5 in a row to develop disgust. Anyway, tomorrow will be hard. 0days, 0hours, 1minute.

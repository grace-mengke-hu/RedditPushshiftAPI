Please help me quit once and for all!

Well, here goes nothing:

I suffer from PTSD and depression, am in therapy, been on anti-anxiety meds for almost a year now. My life and my mind are much better now. 

But. I just can't seem to quit. Each morning as I wake up the first thing that pops into my mind is the thought of a nice cup of coffee and cigarettes. But I really want to quit! I've tried numerous times, and each time I would fail. 

The biggest obstacle I'm facing, really, is that I use cigarettes as an emotional crutch. One I would very much like to get rid of already. I can't financially support my addiction, hell, I don't even want to. But what scares me the most is that quitting will result in my anxiety sky-rocketing. And I just can't deal with that right now, I have classes every work day, I spend most of my time there, I'm involved in a legal battle with my father trying to get the alimony he owes me and I am stressed out as it is already. I'm afraid quitting will result in more stress. 

Just FYI, increasing the dosage of my medication is out of the question, I don't want to do that. I also don't want to use patches, and I know that there are some drugs that help smokers quit but I doubt that a) they're available in my country, b) my doctor would never prescribe something like that to me.

So what do I do? How do I quit and not spend the next few days feeling like I'm about to have a heart-attack? 

Please help me.

All right already. You guys have inspired me!

Watching you guys storm-troop through the first three days and then soldier through the middle ground has pushed me.  I have now gone three days without touching my vaporizer pen.  

I had not been worried about it as the use had fallen to about zero.

This is not big deal.  I just couldn't watch the awesomeness here without punching that ticket.  Thanks guys.

Edit: My badge is when I went nicotine free.  This was just stopping an odd habit.

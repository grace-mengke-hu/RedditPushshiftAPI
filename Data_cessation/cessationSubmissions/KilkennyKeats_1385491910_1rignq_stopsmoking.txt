Christmas Challenge with New Year's milestone

I'm a little bit late to the party, so I'm modifying the Christmas challenge put forth by u/QuitStart19. One of my resolution's for the new year is to finally quit for good. However, wouldn't it be great to have 30 days under my belt when the new year comes around? So I'm setting my quit date  for next Tuesday, December 3.

About three years ago, I didn't smoke for almost 18 months. However, the first cigarette led to me bumming cigarettes (at least I wasn't buying was my justification). Then I would buy a pack (at least I wasn't smoking at home was my justification). The justifications were a slippery slope. 

I actually made it three days this weekend without a cigarette. For me, it doesn't seem the chemical dependence is the hardest. In the right situation, I can go 2-3 days at a time with no problem - at home with the kids, traveling with the family. However, there are triggers that I haven't been able to overcome. And when I do smoke, it generally becomes 10-15 cigarettes in a day.

- Going out to the bar. This is one of the hardest, and why I ended up having a cigarette last night. And of course one turned into five. Many of my friends are already non-smokers, but there are one or two of us (who might be trying to quit at the same time), but the temptation is always there. Not going to the bar is basically out of the question, but I need something else other than drinking that will help me avoid the trigger to smoke.

- Work. I get to work, and the impetus to smoke a cigarette is almost immediate. It provides a break, a chance for socialization, a means of relaxing - the benefits go on.

- Boredom. On the nights where I'm up late at home, and everybody has gone to bed, boredom sets in. I want a smoke just because. Nothing like smoking a cigarette outside on a cold night.

My goal is to quit cold turkey. As I mentioned above, I can already go two or three days without the nicotine, so I don't want to use a patch or an e-cig or anything else that might encourage a dependence on the nicotine. My challenge is in combating those triggers that make smoking a cigarette seem like the best thing to do in that moment.

Any tips on re-directing the triggers without having to resort to a nicotine supplement?

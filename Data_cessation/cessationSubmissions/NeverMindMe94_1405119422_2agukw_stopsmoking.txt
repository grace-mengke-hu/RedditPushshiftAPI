I feel like I want to quit, but I can't find any motivation.

I only smoke around 3-5 a day, but I know it's not good for you. I can go weeks without a cig, but when I tell myself to just stop, it makes me crave one. I am rolling myself a cig right after I post this. I don't know how to push myself to quit. Any help from you guys?

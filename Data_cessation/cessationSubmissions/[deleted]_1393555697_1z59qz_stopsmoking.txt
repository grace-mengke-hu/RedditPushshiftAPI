Should I bother to continue with the EasyWay method.

I've read Allen Carr's book three times, listened to the audio book once, and watched the movie three times, all to no avail. I have an upcoming 10 day spring break in which I plan to quit because I won't be distracted by school. Should I give his method another go or just use willpower?

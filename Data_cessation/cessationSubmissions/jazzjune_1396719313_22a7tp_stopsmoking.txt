Day 2: anxiety med question

So I'm at day 2 and I've felt nervous,  panicked,  and just generally anxious and unhappy all day.   I know that it will pass and I've tried jogging and sucking hard candies... but... what are your thoughts on taking a valium or something to take the edge off these first 3 days?  Will it help or make my cravings worse?

4 days vape free, 1 month smoke free. My chest feels amazing!

Started smoking at 6 years ago, switched to vaping 3 years ago, then got stuck in a "quit vaping, buy a cigar, buy a vape to quit cigars, repeat" cycle. 3 black and milds feels worse than a pack of cigs a day. Was my lowest point and biggest shame.

Since I couldn't believe that vaping is as safe as it's enthusiasts say, I began ramping down to 3mg. Then when my 3mg bottle was half empty, I filled it back up with 0mg. When that mixture was half empty, I repeated the cycle, diluting the mixture each time.

That dilution phase lasted about a month, and I can't really say when the nicotine reached negligible levels. Then, a few days after Christmas, I finally ran out of liquid and threw my vape away. This was a big eye opener as to how weak the nicotine addiction actually is. The habit of smoking/feeling the smoke is much harder to break in my opinion.

All the nicotine was already LONG GONE from my system, and this has been the easiest quit I've ever done. Breaking the habit of actually smoking/vaping is the only challenge, which I replaced with a Vicks Steam Inhaler.

This inhaler feels like the opposite of a vape, hydrating my lungs instead of stealing moisture. The Vicks menthol scent is even close to what I used to vape.

Now, when I run in the cold, I have not been having bouts of athesma and I can hit the kickboxing bag with much more intensity. I think I am recovering faster between sets of weightlifting as well. I also don't wake up out of breath anymore, which was getting scary.

I know it's only technically 4 days, but I have dramatically decreased the past month and wanted to ramble about my success. If anyone is struggling with quitting vaping, I highly suggest trying micro-dilution like I did.

Thanks for listening!

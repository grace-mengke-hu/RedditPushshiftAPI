I quit smoking 18 days ago

and its awesome. my sense of smell is coming back, seriously I haven't smelled the rain in the past 7 years. I just wanted to share it with this subreddit which helped me in the first few days. 

It's been 18 days now as a nonsmoker and what keeps me going are the cravings, whenever I think about going back I get more strength because I wont let cigarettes control the rest of my life

I am only 23 years old. I smoked for the last 7 years 1 pack a day with only 1 serious attempt of quitting. It lasted for 1 month and taught me a lesson about starting and keeping at minimum again.

It wont happen ever again, I know the drill now.

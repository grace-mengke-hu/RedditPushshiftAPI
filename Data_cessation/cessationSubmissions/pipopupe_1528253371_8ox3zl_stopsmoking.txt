Oh yeah, by the way, one year!

Well it was SUPER hard for me to stop, I was down emotionally stuck in a situation and job I didn't like, but I thought "if I wait for a better time to stop smoking, it might just never come" and stopped using patches at first. 

Now that's one year, and that reminds me the badges of the people I was seeing here, which made me say, "i wish I can reach that".

Here I am. It still sometimes there, the desire, but 99,9% of the time I just don't even think about it. Life without it is perfect.

Good luck and courage to everyone.

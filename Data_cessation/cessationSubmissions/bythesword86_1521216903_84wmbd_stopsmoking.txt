2 Weeks In and I got a Beer Belly!

Hello everybody, I just had a quick quesiton for long term quitters. 

I'm 32 and 2 weeks into not smoking, and I literally just grew a pot belly in what seems like over night... I'm a really tall dude who has never, ever gained weight. I have eaten entire large pizzas to my face followed by 4 beers and then 2 pounds of chicken wings. It's basically impossible for me to gain weight anywhere. I've read up online that quitting smoking can cause this random weight gain... But it apparently goes away? 

Any experience from anyone? It's actually really bothering me... Obviously I'm going to work out and stuff, do cardio.. Just need some reassurance...

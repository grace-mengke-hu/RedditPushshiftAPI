So this is it

After finishing this post i'm going to have one last cig. Been thinking about this moment for months and finally it's here. Been smoking for about 10 years or so and i'm tired of this crap going on day after day, year after year. I know i can do it. Physically i think i should be ok, being around smoking friends, thats where it might get tough. And with new years coming soon it's inevitable that i'll be around them and there will be few drinks too. Anyways, i feel extra confident and motivated, can't believe this is it, wish me luck!

Stopped 2 weeks now and doing amazingly well. Here are some tips!

I know 2 weeks is still not a big accomplishment but I must admit that they I never could have dreamt it would go so "easy".

A bit about myself: I'm 28yo, and smoked 10 years. First two years as a occasionally smoker, after that as a "full-time" smoker with 15-20 cigs a day. Never really had any issues until last year. I experienced I needed more and more time to recover from colds, the frequently coughing started to stay. I tried to stop smoking when my son was born 1,5 year ago, but couldn't cope. Everything was new and sometimes stressful so it didn't take long until I grabbed my cigarette again.

The tips:

About a month ago I decided to quit. I searched for some tips and tricks in the first weeks. Here are those that helped me the most:

* Pin a date and time when you stop. Don't do it too fast (e.g. not tomorrow morning). I pinned a date that was 2 weeks ahead for me. Try to pin a date that is special to you (e.g. a birthday, anniversary,...). For me it was the day I enlisted my son for toddler school. 
* Now you have a date pinned, sometimes force yourself to experience the "cold turkey" by denying yourself a cigarette (e.g. if you normally smoke 1 each hour, try to force yourself to wait like 4-5 hours) In this period you won't experience it as a failure if you fail in this, but you are strengthing your mind to bear the cold turkey.
* Try to define the most difficult moments and search for a good answer for those before they happen, most likely these are just bad habits. Things that helped me was: regular chewing gum and when I really was in such need, I brushed my teeth or ate a piece of fruit. I concentrated on the taste of the fruit. Every day you get further, you taste better and it feels as a reward every time again.
* The first few days are hard, but you have to go through these. Try to plan a few really busy days so you even don't have time to think about smoking.
* Try to fool your own mind and don't put too much weight on your ambitions to stop smoking. If you are constantly thinking "I cannot smoke, I cannot smoke,..." well... you're thinking about smoking all the time and it will lower your strength to resist. Your mind is like a child that constantly needs some toys to play with. Read a book, play a (video)game, go for a run (really good as you feel your longues burn and don't have a need for a cigarette the first couple of hours after), try to do some chores that have been too long on the to-do-list, ect...  

Even if you fail, don't let let it stop you. This is my fifth try. First two times I tried to reduce the amount per day to ultimately stop, but never got to that point. The last two times I really stopped from day on day, I didn't manage to get further than 2 days. The last time was two years ago and I was really disappointed in myself. It really harmed my self esteem and I felt like to be a smoker until the end of times. Now I am confident again I stopped smoking and it really, really feels so awarding, every day again. 

Whatever the incentive for you is to stop smoking, stick to this incentive and don't doubt yourself. I am sure anyone can stop smoking, but only you can make you believe that!

Quit in Korea

I am feeling pretty good at this point. I managed to quit cold turkey in the smokers paradise that is South Korea. I may have gained a nasty sweet tooth but I can breathe so much better and I am not waking up coughing up a lung anymore. Its still difficult to stay out late drinking but I know I cant have even 1 or I have to do all this shit over again.

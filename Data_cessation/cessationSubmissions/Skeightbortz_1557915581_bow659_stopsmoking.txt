First month clean! Friend decided to pull an insensitive “prank”.

Hey guys, never posted to this sub but I’ve lurked from time to time before and after making the decision to quit. I’m 29 days clean as of righting this, and I could not be more thankful for my decision to go clean. However, I still do enjoy vaping but my girlfriend owns a vape with no nicotine so I rip that while all my friends have their own nic devices.

Now here’s where the “prank” comes in. I was hanging out with my friends preparing for a video screening we had later that day for a project we had been working on. One of my friends had been telling me that he was going to bring me a CBD pod so I had something extra to do while relaxing. When I asked for it he passed me his device and within three rips I felt the familiar body tingling sensation and instantly knew something was up. So I passed it back after noticing him and a couple friends laughing at my reaction and just mentally facepalmed myself for falling for it.

If anything I was reminded in that moment how shitty nicotine was without actually making the commitment to try it again. I still love my friends even though they can be assholes and not realize the effect that could have had on somebody struggling to quit. Not sure why I spent the time writing this up, just wanted to share a dumb story with you guys❤️

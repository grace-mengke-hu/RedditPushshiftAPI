this is silly

This is silly, just plain silly. The only thing holding me back is me. I need to apply the same rule to cigarettes that I did to alcohol. None. A craving is like a hot flash (that will make perfect sense to some of you and baffle others). It will pass. 
I just have to do it. Simple. 
Thanking you for letting me vent.

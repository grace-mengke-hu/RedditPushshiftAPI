21days

Whew! I've made it to three weeks! It's been rough but doable. I am very very very thankful for this subreddit, whyquit.com, and my friends for helping me get this far. 

I thought I was going to lose it this last week but I hung in there because I made the commitment. 

New quitters, hang in there.

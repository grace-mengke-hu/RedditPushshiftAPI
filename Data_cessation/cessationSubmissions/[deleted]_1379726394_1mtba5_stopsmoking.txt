I´m so proud right now

I just played a small live poker tournament today. At every break people rushed out to smoke and even sometimes during the tournament. Couple of months ago I was one of them.

I made the final table and the house rule says that when the final table starts, people are allowed to smoke indoors. 7 out of 9 people are smokers at the table and started to light up their cigaretts right away. I couldn´t give less shit about them smoking at the table. It really felt like I am finally not a smoker.

Busted in 7th place and got nothing but who cares? I feel like I have won my personal tournament.

I think this are the situations where most people start to smoke again because really everybody around you is lighting up every minute and you used to do that too.


I´m so proud right now.

About to stop smoking, looking for some positivity to reinfornce my bastard brain

So, I've been using tobacco off and on (emphasis on the "on") for the past 5 years. I'm mid twenties now, and I'd love to no longer rely on something as an emotional crutch. When I'm anxious, I'll have a snus. When there's no snus, I'll cave and buy cigarettes. "Just one when I really need it, then I'll get snus." But then the whole pack is gone and nothing changes.

I've been reading and rereading Carr, and I do like many of the ideas, however it's difficult to just take the plunge and avoid the next craving. When I'm working, I think "ah, give in now, quit tomorrow so you can at least finish your work. Gotta make money and you can't afford withdrawal now." It's bullshit, but it's how my mind works at the moment.

I've quit once before, and I made it about 4 months until just deciding, "eh, I'll enjoy it some more while I'm young." But I won't be young forever, and now's the best time to quit.

So this post is kinda a diary, and also a way for you to share any helpful stories or tips. Some of the things holding me up are:

• Worries that I won't work to my fullest without tobacco. I've always worked with tobacco and this is new terrain for me.

• Worried I'll be a douche to anyone unfortunate enough to be near me. I'm going to workout more this week and take deep breaths.

• Worried that the "confusion" will last too long for me to do what I need. I'd love to just stop and say "cool, I'm done. Won't have one." But eh.

Even now, after writing, it does seem easier to stop. It's literally doing nothing, and that's not so difficult. So fuck it. Let's do nothing and not smoke. Easiest way to stay alive.

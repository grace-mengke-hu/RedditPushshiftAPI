Going for my second Reddit badge.

Smoked and drank everyday for 25 years. Finally got tired of both. Quit drinking 10 days ago and have a badge on /stopdrinking. Initially, I was going to quit both at the same time, but figured it would be too much to handle at once. Decided the whiskey had to go first, then cigarettes two weeks later. Monday (Labor Day) is my quit day. I'll be requesting my second Reddit badge then.

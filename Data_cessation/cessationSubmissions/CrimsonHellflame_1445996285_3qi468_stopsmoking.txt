I'm at 144 days and kind of faltering.

So I quit a 15 year half-pack a day (average) habit for about 8 months with the help of Chantix and thought I was good. Then I fell into one every now and then, then one a day, then a few after work, then one with my morning coffee, etc... I never got back to the same level but I wasn't a non-smoker anymore. So I quit again. 

Didn't use Chantix this time around and, surprisingly, I had very little trouble. I'm at 144 days and none of my normal triggers give me pause anymore. Coffee, sex, alcohol, driving, you name it I'm perfectly fine. I've felt like this is gonna stick. 

Over the last week I've been randomly lusting after a cigarette. Not just craving, but day 1 type cravings. They pass but have been consistent for the past week and are starting to frustrate me. Dunno if I need help or commiseration or even if I'm just typing this so I'm accountable for my actions, but I thought I'd share. 

Anybody else have a weird experience so far out from a quit date?

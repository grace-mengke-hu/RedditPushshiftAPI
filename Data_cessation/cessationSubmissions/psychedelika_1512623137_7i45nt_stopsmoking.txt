I've been smoking for 7 years and I decided to cut it cold turkey 5 days ago.

The first 3 days were the worst. I could not focus properly. I felt tired all the time. I also ate like a horse. Probably gained some weight too. However, after that, the results were rewarding. I have discovered my hidden ability to challenge myself and test the maximum limits of my patience. Tomorrow will be day #5 for me. I still have that urging feeling ('I need a smoke right now' feeling) but I force myself to get busy with something else (like having a cup of coffee instead of the cigarette, for example) until it becomes a habit, and then you get used to putting yourself in that pattern of thought. I have never seen such support from friends and family like the support I am getting for quitting smoking. That alone gives me enough strength to power through this upcoming new phase of life.

Alcohol makes me smoke :(

I've quit smoking a 5 days ago. It's going very well - I am using Smoke Free app which is an excellent tool to keep tracking your progress, but also reading Allen Carr "Easy Way to Stop Smoking". All said, yesterday was a bit of a disaster. Having had a couple of drinks after work, I lapsed and had 3 that evening.

What is your experience in controlling cravings when having a drink during social occasions? Alcohol seems to be the real issue when it comes to abstaining from cigarettes for me, but I am very sociable and don't want to lock myself away from social life.

I would be very interested to read your thoughts and get any advice!

People are more discouraging than supportive. I need hope.

Im going through some tough exams right now which ends in a week. I've been studying for a few months for it. My smoking which began in april grew pretty fast to a pack day. 

When I began i craved the buzz. I didn't know what it would be like once i was addicted. I didn't know that once i was smoking regularly it will suck my time and money. That it will no longer give you enjoyment. That you'll smoke just to be normal. That how desperate i will be without it.

I am convinced that i will quit once this stressful patch is over.

But the people are actually discouraging. They say i can not quit. That it's impossible. You'll ultimately relapse. And it has effected my enthusiasm to quit. I am actually thinking if I'll be able to do it.

 A doctor said people can't quit. A lot of friends told me i cant.

Tldr: I need to see hope... I need to know if its possible to let this go permanently.

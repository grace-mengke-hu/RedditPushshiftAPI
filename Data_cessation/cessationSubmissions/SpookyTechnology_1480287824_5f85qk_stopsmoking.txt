No cigs since Thursday, feeling good about this

Smoked for about 5 years... I was never a heavy smoker to begin with, and have been gradually cutting down over the years anyway so I thought I may as well try quitting altogether...

I started vaping just over a month ago at 3mg nicotine and smoked my last cig on Wednesday night - it feels like it has been forever but I don't miss it at all

so much coughing... so much foot tapping

Day Juan

Hey all

Today's the day. I kept having dreams last night about people telling me to quit smoking, and I mean everyone in the damn dream, so I decided it was time to do so. I threw away everything associated with cigarettes and I'm doing this. You'll probably be seeing a lot more of me from now on though haha.

When does it go from actively managing cravings to 'I don't even think of smoking anymore'? I'm very tired.

Just passed the week 3 mark. Although the cravings have gotten better, my willpower seems to be waning. 

My sister smokes. Every time I see or smell her lighting one up, I have to muster up all my willpower to not walk over and bum a smoke. I had no issues with this at first. But 3 weeks after the quit date, the novelty has worn off and constantly having to exercise my willpower is very, very draining.

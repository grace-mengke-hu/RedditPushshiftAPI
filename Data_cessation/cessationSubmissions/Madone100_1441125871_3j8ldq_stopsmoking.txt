How I quit

I used to smoke half a pack to 1 every day until a friend of mine recommended

1) regretting the habit (most important step) the regret has to be a firm remorse coming from the heart, normally think about how it hurts the people you care about, e.g smoking makes you tired and half assed leading to poorer all round outlook, your job suffers , you yell thus hurt people you care about, you've wasted years where you had your looks and could have done so much more with your life but was not able to because of being so tired from smoking, try not smoking for two weeks and see how you feel when you get up, you'll feel much lighter

2) cut back slowly

Find a newer habit to take the place of smoking because you will crave, I use to pop strong mints, a bunch of stuff I never would have ate if it wasn't cause I was trying to get the edge off, picked up arguing with my girlfriend more (I made sure she knew it was recreational, you don't want to offend women), make sure the new habit you pick up is not worse than smoking, anything that harms you or others is not good, e.g. Hunting, fishing, stuff like that, 

There's one other thing you need to do but I don't remember but I will re edit after I find out what my friend said, it might be sticking to your guns when the craving comes

Every day is a victory

My brain is such an asshole. Just here at work and suddenly I’m thinking “I should just go buy a pack today. Have a couple while out to lunch. Just today, no big deal. No one would know.”

FUCK!!! These thoughts have been happening a lot more often over the last few days. Stay vigilant everyone. You think it’s easy, you have it beat and then BAM! That one month range is a real sneaky bitch.

To pass the time, I checked my app and worked out how far all the cigarettes I haven’t smoked would stretch, end-to-end. 688 unsmoked cigarettes equals about 63 yards, or 2/3 of a football field. That’s also slightly taller than the leaning tower of Pisa. Holy shit. Not going back today. Not going back ever.

Thanks to everyone on this sub.

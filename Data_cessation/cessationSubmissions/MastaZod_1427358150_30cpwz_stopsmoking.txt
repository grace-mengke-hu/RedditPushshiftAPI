New perspective : guess who is stronger than every one else ?

Juste take a second and think about this :

Smoker are under addiction.

Non-smoker refuse to meet this state of addiction

Quitters are smokers that want to fight the addiction...


WE are stronger than everyone. We fight against the addiction when the other will never have to.

We are fighter, and we will win our battle and prove that we are stronger than an stupid addiction !

Keep your position, raise your shield, raise your weapon. We standing up there, watching each other. Nothing can stop us !

Here goes nothing... (-03m:00s to quitting)

I've done cold turkey before, lasted three months first then one month a second time.

I just wanna feel less apathetic. It'd be cool to be able to stop smoking and cut back on smoking pot as much (maybe once every two days).

Any good distractions? About to start a 9 hr shift in a dishpit? I don't even wanna bring my smokes with me but I'll panic without them there I'm afraid.

How do I get past the "bad" days?

Just found out my girlfriend is breaking up with me, still forced to be roommates with her and her friend.

I'm basically in a corner when I'm at home all to my self. Right now I feel a lot of anger and resentment. Theres a 7/11 like 100 ft away from my house and I just want to walk over there and grab ONE cig and choke it down. 

How do I get past these feelings?

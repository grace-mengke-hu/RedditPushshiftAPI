1 year since my last cigarette.

After smoking 20 years my wife and I quit together last year. We've saved about $6,000.00 during that time. My PS4 collection loves me being tobacco free. Based on my savings alone, I could have smoked cigarettes for one year or purchased 56 PS4 games. So if you're a gamer and smoker, quit now, it's awesome.

Almost caved due to Mouth Pain

Hey. So I've made it through 12 days now. Dealt with the cravings, mood fluctuations, and insomnia. But for the last couple of days my teeth and gums have hurt so badly I seriously contemplated quitting my quit just for some relief. 

Well. A little research and a little trial and error have brought me to this: Colgate Peroxyl and Orasol. They have gone a long way in providing my gums with relief from the onset of "healing pains" 

I hope this finds whoever needs to read this. Thank you for your time.

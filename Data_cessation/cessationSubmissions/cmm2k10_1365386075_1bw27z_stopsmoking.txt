Been smoking for 15 years

Day 1 on a long journey, but one that I am excited to take. I have never really wanted to quit smoking until recently. I liked smoking infact I never thought about quitting much when people said you should quit.. I was like no thanks!  but I have noticed in the past month or so every time I smoke I think I need to quit smoking! This is stupid! This controls me! What am I going to do when I have to tell my kids I have cancer. I finally want to quit I need to quit and F*CK IT I am done!

Cravings after 8 days

Hi everyone, 

After 12 and a half years of smoking I have decided to quit the habit with the help of nicotine patches. The first week without cigarettes passed by smoother then I expected, the first three days were the worst (especially the third day) but after that it was manageable. 

Today (day 8) I am having the worst cravings since I gave up cigarettes, all I could think of the whole day were the "pleasures" that came with smoking. I don`t understand however why this is happening, from all the research I did, most people relate that after the 3`rd day it becomes easier to cope with not smoking. 

Has anyone else had these issues? Any ideas on how to handle these? 

Thanks in advance for your help!

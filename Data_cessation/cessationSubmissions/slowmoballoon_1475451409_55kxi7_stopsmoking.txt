13 Days and counting. When does the coughing stop?

Since I have quit smoking, I have had an awful productive cough and have been extremely fatigued. I was taking Mucinex and allergy pills to help clear some of the congestion but I figured I should start letting my body do it on its own. I drink tea with honey to soothe my throat. I have to sleep with my head at an incline or I will wake up hacking. I also have coughing fits if I try any strenuous activity...         

I looked back on past posts about "Quitter's Flu" and I'm pretty sure this is the case for me.  I smoked about 1/2 pack a day off and on for 12 years. I have quit a total of 6 times. This is the first time I quit cold turkey.            

Has anyone else had experience with "Quitter's Flu"? How long does it generally last? What symptoms did you experience? I just want to stop coughing and start exercising!!

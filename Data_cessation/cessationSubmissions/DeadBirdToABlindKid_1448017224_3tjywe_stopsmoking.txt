Been having cravings recently

Hi all, could do with a bit of support. Haven't smoked in 7 months, which I have loved. Thought I had kicked the habit clean. However recently, I have been having cravings for cigarettes. 
I see others on smoking breaks or just having a cigarette, and think I could go for one right now. About 30 seconds later, I realize that is not at all what I want, but I have been fighting the temptation to have just one recently.

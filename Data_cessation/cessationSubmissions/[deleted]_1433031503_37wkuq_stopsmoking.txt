Smashing through 25 a day with ease. Anyone else?

It's become a joke. I need to quit but I ache without one. I've tried the pathes, the gum and cold turkey. it just doesnt work. I'm weak to nicotine. 


How do I quit. I have had enough. My son is 5 and a half months and I am sick of brushing my teeth and washing my hands after every smoke. I'm tired of walking steps and being puffed out after 3 flights. 

I know all these thing but I still continue to smoke. I have had enough. HOW DO I STOP IT

4 days! It feels so good

It was hard getting back on the horse, I got sick with sinuses/flu I still don't know what it is, but have been in bed and have not smoked in four whole days! 
Before I woulndt of cared and would had smoked through ilness, but this time I just needed extra help getting back on my feet, maybe getting sick was it. 
Its been relatively easy because I've been in bed, avoiding the world and just relaxing and drinking tea. Working from home and focusing on getting better and not smoking. 
But I missed this! I missed not smoking! Waking up in the mornings without having to rush outside lightning the first cigarette of the day without even brushing my teeth first. That's how addicted I was.

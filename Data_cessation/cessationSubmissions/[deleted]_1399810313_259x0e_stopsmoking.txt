Day 4. I feel awful.

Got through day 3 but I only slept for 3 hours before I woke up in a panic, with flu symptoms to boot. I immediately felt like death, I'm dealing with a pretty bad quitters flu to the point I'm questioning whether or not I have an actual flu. I don't wanna give up, I'm so proud of myself and excited to keep going. When I see my baby niece today for mothers day I won't have to keep missing moments! 

I keep telling myself I only have to do this once. 

How long can I expect to feel like this? I know it's a process and it ain't easy but I think I just need a reminder this will get better and/or a virtual hug. 

Ha. While writing this a family member lit up and had a hacking fit. That was a well timed coincidence. It doesn't bother me to see others smoke, the smell just makes me naseous. I consider that progress.

Rambling. Thanks for listening.

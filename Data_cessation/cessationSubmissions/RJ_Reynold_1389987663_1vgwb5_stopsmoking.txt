dedication

To start off I am at about 2 weeks clean. I'm having a real hard time keeping the same determination that I had when I was 0 days clean. I get that the chemical is out of my brain, but the cravings aren't going away at all. Sure a craving only lasts a few minutes, but its an arbitrary distinction when its immediately followed by another cravings. 

Even though I'm improving my fitness - running and lifting weights and can feel my body healing I just want a cig still. I've realized that its not all about the buzz, nor the physical dependence. It all boils down to the look and feel, because let's face it tough and cool people smoke - an oxymoronic statement, one that is rooted in societal programming.

I've logically found my reason to quit and found my will power to tough out the "hardest" first few days. Yet in the face of that the thought of smoking is still getting kicked around my brain very regularly. Don't know what to do, but swing a dumbell around until my arm falls off and bitch about it on here. <3

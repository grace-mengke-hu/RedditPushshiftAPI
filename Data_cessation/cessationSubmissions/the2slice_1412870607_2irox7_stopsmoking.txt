2 days quit...It's been hard, but I'll make it!

It's been 2 days since I've quit. Despite being on edge and having nic fits, I'm doing well... I really think I'll make it! 

I did slip up and have a cigarette earlier (~30 minutes ago) :-(

Anyone have some web links/subreddits for coping with stressors without cigarettes?

The first day of the rest of my life

I'm sitting in my living room, writing this while I smoke my last cigarette. Breathing in this disgusting smoke. I know that I've said this many times, but this time the words have to have meaning. As I think back on the last ten years, I can't find a single time that a cigarette has brought me true happiness. I reflect on the the reasons while I'm still smoking. The truth is that I'm afraid to leave this all behind. Not the cigarette itself, but everything it embodies. I'm afraid to leave behind the comfort I've learned to find in my own unhappiness. The cigarette has become the mascot of everything that I don't like about myself

It's time to change. And like I said, this time has to be the time that I quit. As I existinguish my final cigarette, I imagine it killing off my past, leaving nothing behind but lingering smoke. I have already made a lot of drastic changes in my life, and I really don't need these cigarettes anymore. Years from now, when my body has fully recovered, I want to be able to look myself and the eye and compliment me for taking myself seriously. That's the man I want to be, that's who I know I already am. No more excuses.

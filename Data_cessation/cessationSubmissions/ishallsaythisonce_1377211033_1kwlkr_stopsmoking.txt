Day 3 - done

Quitting was not so bad thus far... Day 1 & 2 were quite a breeze. A few minor cravings here and there... much easier than expected. 

Day 3, on the other hand... I couldn't fall off to sleep last night. Just kept tossing and turning, craving for a smoke. Then in the evening went on an emotional roller coaster with this chic. Worst urge I've had to smoke in forever. Felt like my whole body was boiling. 

But I did it. I resisted. I'm quite calm now. I've weathered the storm. Now as I get into bed, I can proudly say about the dreaded Day 3... DONE

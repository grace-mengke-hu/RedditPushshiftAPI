3 days now

I finished reading Allen Carr's EASYWAY 3 days ago and I have not yet had a rough day. I have smoked for about 5/6 years but I'm now a proud non-smoker! Just wanted to share :)  
I went to a party right after I had quit and smoking inside was allowed, I was very drunk but I didn't cave!!  
Also, I can smell again :) life as a non-smoker is great :))

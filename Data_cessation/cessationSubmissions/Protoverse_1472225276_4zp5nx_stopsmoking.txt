Should I bother quitting? Am I already doomed to cancer and health problems?

I'm 28 years old, smoked on and off when I was 16 for about a year. When I turned 20 I started smoking reds, pretty much a pack a day for a few years. I cut down to half a pack and it's been that way since up until last year, where sometimes I wouldn't smoke at all for a month or two. I'm currently doing about 3 - 5 packs a month. I do vape, which I think has helped me go for a month or weeks here or there without smoking, but it's still inhaling vapor and chemicals (though far safer) and not air.

I'm just wondering, being 28 and having 8 years of continuous smoking would there even be a point in quitting now. I suspect it's been so long already that I'm doomed to cancer and lung problems, even if I never picked one up again and started living healthier in general.

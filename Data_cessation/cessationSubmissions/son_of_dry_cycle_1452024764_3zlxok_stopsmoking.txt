Unintentional New Years quitter, on 5 days

I'd been struggling to stay off tobacco for the month of December. I'd go a day or two, smoke, go another day or two, smoke and so on. When I was off them I was so short-tempered and irrational that it was causing my wife significant anxiety.

For about 6 months this year I had switched to an e-cigarette but found that I wasn't really able to stick to "The Plan", which was to slowly wean myself off nicotine - I went from 18mg to 6mg, then 3, 6, 3, 6, 3, 6 and so on. I got frustrated with it and threw out my batteries, charger and liquid so I wouldn't be able to vape. A day or so later I promptly went back to tobacco.

I decided to split the quit into two separate sections - dealing with the habit and dealing with nicotine withdrawal. On New Year's Day, I went and got myself a patch and haven't smoked or vaped since.

The unexpected thing was that I am still having very powerful urges to smoke throughout the day. Morning coffee, practicing the double bass, after meals, all the usual times when I would normally have vaped or smoked are the worst. I am not feeling any significant withdrawal because of the patch and yet I still can't stop thinking about smoking.

Breaking it up into two sections has helped. I can deal with the habitual stuff or with the withdrawal, but both at the same time is a lot for me. I'm a recovering alcoholic with about a 14 months of sobriety and I've had a lot of practice with ignoring urges to use a substance. I'm hoping that this stage will pass in a few weeks and I can get on with the second stage, which will be stepping down my patches as prescribed.

Just venting for the sake of venting I suppose. Can't wait to be free of this crap.

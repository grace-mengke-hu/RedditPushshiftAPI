DAMN! I was doing SO well!!

Son of a bitch! Had a week under my belt. Was feeling awesome! Sleeping great; feeling amazing; a little irritable in the evenings but handling it really well.
My BEST attempt EVER!

Then FWB goes lame and doesn't have the courage/optimism/desire to drive a while hour to come see me and discover I quit and ravish me for my birthday!

Fuck it! I got irritated and decided the wknd was gonna be boring so had a couple beers and bought a pack.

Fucking depressing after feeling SO GOOD!

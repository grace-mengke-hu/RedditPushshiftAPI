The benefits!!

Today is day 33 or 34 of me being smoke free.  This is the longest I have gone without smoking since I started roughly 5 years ago.

Yesterday I went on the first run in a few years where I did not feel a single throb or pain in my lungs.  I was tired, sure.  I was hot as hell.  But I never had to slow down because my lungs were hurting.

I just want to say thanks to this subreddit for being supportive and lending me all of the mental tricks I used to quit.  After two weeks, I stopped even thinking about smoking.  While out drinking last night, I saw friends smoking.  Although I loved the smell and thought I wanted a drag, I thought about it and decided that No, I do not want a drag.

Just some thoughts.  I feel so confident from quitting smoking that I know I can quit any other bad habits or maintain any goods habits (e.g. running) that I want.

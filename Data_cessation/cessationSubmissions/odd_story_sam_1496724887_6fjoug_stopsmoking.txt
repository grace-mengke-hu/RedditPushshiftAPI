Hell Week has begun

Hey folks, 
Smoking is ingrained in my ritualistic life which has made quitting quite the epic battle. For nearly 8 years I've been a pack-a-day smoker. I smoke with my coffee, after meals, after sex, when I'm bored, when I'm on an adventure, but mainly when I'm around alcohol. Go figure. And I work at a brewery. You can imagine the road that leads me down. 

My best bud and I have decided to do a Hell Week. No smoking, no alcohol, and no sexual activity for a week. We must also exercise for a minimum of 30 minutes every day. If you fail you pay the other $200 and must wear the badge of shame. 

I have a non-smoking friend who will be a referee/coach to whom we will report to daily.

Many of you might say "Whoa, way to extreme." Or "You need to quit for yourself NOT for a bet" but I'm honestly not looking for your criticism of this technique. I'm looking for support. I'm new to Reddit but this seems like a community for support and not for judgement. 

Any words of encouragement would be vastly appreciated. I'm having my last cigarette and pint as I type. Hell Week begins when I open my eyes tomorrow morning. 

I am the master of my fate. I am the captain of my soul.

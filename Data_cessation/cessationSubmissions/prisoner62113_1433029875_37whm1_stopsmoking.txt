I climbed a mountain

Actually it was a volcano, but that's not important right now.

I wouldn't call it easy for me - I'm pretty out of practice - but my hiking partner still smokes and she had a lot more trouble than me. At the top I was fine but she was breathing heavily even though she is a very light smoker. Pretty sad come to think about it. Random smoking thought #156214.

But I got to enjoy my 50th day breathing easy watching [sunset](http://i.imgur.com/3KAeRZt.jpg)

Not too shabby.

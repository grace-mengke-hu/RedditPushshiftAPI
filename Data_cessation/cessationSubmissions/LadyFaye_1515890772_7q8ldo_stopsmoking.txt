Wow. I don't stink anymore.

I am on day 8. I still have the occasional moment, but they are fairly short. I had a work function surrounded by 100 non-smoker (there used to be 2 of us smoking in that big group). Now there is 1. He smelled terrible. I am so glad I don't have to worry about that ever again.

My sister and another 2 friends also stopped this week. I didn't even know they had been thinking about it, and they didn't know I had quit either. I keep asking if anyone wants to be accountability buddies. My sister stepped up. My 2 friends ignored my offer.

I would love to see all of us make it. I'm never going back and I hope it's the same for them!

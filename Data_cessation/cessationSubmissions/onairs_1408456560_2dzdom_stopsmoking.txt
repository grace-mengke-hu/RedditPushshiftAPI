At least I'm not smoking!

I was walking to the train today and feeling a bit stiff in the legs and back. I started to kick myself for slacking on my yoga practice (which was going really strong a month ago but I haven't done in a week). Out of the corner of my eye I saw someone lighting up and it reminded me: Jesus, why am I beating myself up? At least I'm not smoking. I'm doing amazing! 


The worst health-related problem I've got going is that I'm not stretching enough?! It's easy for me to forget that a year ago I was an overweight chain smoker with legitimate fears about my health. 


What a blessing to be able to sweat the small stuff.

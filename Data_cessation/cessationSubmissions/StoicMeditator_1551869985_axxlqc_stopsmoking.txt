Extreme cravings and lethargy

I quit caffeine two weeks ago. Quit smoking around 4 months ago. Have been using an e cigarette (3mg nicotine) during my quit.
I feel tired and lazy almost all the time.
I don’t have any motivation for a lot. I’m in my 20s but I just don’t know what to do. I feel like I have to force myself to do anything. Feel so indecisive.  The past two weeks my cravings for cigarettes have been very intense at times.
I’m craving one right now.
I feel like when I was smoking I was at least ... productive? But I feel like that’s just me lying to myself.
I can’t go back to caffeine because it was causing me really bad anxiety and panic attacks. And I was abusing it too. 
What do I do? How do I regain my energy... or is this just the new normal for me? Am tired of using caffeine or nicotine just to function. Feel like I’ve changed my bodies chemistry for good. Like I’ll be stuck like this, in this lethargic and demotivated hell. I don’t know what to do.

Tomorrow I'll be one of you!

I've done 2 1/2 weeks of Chantix and just smoked the last cigarette from the pack I've been nursing for a week. TBH I haven't really felt like smoking due to the Chantix but I felt like I had to finish the pack because they were there. An added bonus is that the Chantix makes me not really feel like drinking, either, and that's really what's kept me from quitting in the past. That, and a very strict budget that has no room for cigarettes, and I think I can finally kick this!

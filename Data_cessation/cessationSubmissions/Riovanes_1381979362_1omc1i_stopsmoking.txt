Laid off, bought a pack to further wallow in misery

Do I actually feel better? No, of course I don't. All I did was bring back the itch.

Still, I was cheating a fair amount at that job - all of my co-workers smoked, and I missed those "smoke pit" hangouts, so I started bumming pretty frequently. So it sucks that I don't have work, but for my quit, at least, this is probably the best thing.

I'm finishing up the pack tonight for the sake of reminiscence. I have to admit it's kind of nice to remember old times with my buddy cigarettes. But starting tomorrow I'm going totally clean again. Just posting this to re-affirm my commitment. I think that I genuinely want to quit, as opposed to "wanting to want to", so I have confidence in myself tomorrow to make the right decision and not buy another pack.

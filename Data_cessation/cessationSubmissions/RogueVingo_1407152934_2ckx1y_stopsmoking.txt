I quit smoking 2 days ago.

I been meaning to quit smoking on and off for a year.  Now I have finally decided to do it. 

My reason for stopping was the amount of money I was smoking away. About $140 a month for cigarettes,  $1680 a year, now that is getting out of hand, I'll think I spend that on getting a new laptop or something.

Just thought I share.

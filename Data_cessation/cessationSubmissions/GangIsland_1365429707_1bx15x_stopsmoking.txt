Day three: no smoke.

I've started/quit 20+ times. But I'm  trying to make this the final straw. My last cigarette was at Friday at 5:00pm. It's now 10:00am, two days and 7 hours later. I need this to be the last one.

Should I haven't used my vapor cig during these last few days quitting. If I have an immediate craving should I resort to it or should I toughen it out?

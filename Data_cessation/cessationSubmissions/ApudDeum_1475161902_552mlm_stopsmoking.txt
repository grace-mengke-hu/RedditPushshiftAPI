Been smoking since 2010

Decided to quit. There are times through 2014, 2015, and 2016 where I have gone 3-8 months without it. But somehow, it keeps coming back into my life and I continue to smoke cigarettes.

I don't smoke as much as I use to (everyday), however I still smoke every now and then which I know will eventually lead to everyday again.

Anyways, Looking to change my life, and quit for good. Lets go!

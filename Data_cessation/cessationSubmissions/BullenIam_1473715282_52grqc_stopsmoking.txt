so proud of myself

So I crunched the numbers today, and turns out it will be 4 weeks on Friday since I quit. It probably doesn't seem like much but I'm so proud of myself! I have been using a vape but I don't even feel like I need that anymore so it's going like tomorrow when I go to work, or at least try and go the day without it. I'm just so proud of myself and I'm actually glad I've quit and can now see those stupid cancer sticks did nothing for me! And now I can afford FIFA 17 and Forza Horizon ,3 so I can even see the benefits already, and I've started to lose weight again after the initial gain. Anyone on the edge about quitting do it and change your life!

I've tried quitting so many times it's embarrassing

This will be my 4th serious attempt to kick it after smoking between half a pack and full pack per day, on and off, for the last 5 years. First try was cold turkey; attempts 2 and 3 I used patches, which were extremely effective - they made me so nauseous I didn't even want to think about smoking....until I ran out...but I can't use them again now because they irritated my skin.

I got a job on Friday that requires me to be in top shape, so I threw out the rest of my cigs yesterday morning, hit the gym. My new, expensive vaporizer is getting a hell of a workout. 

Things I have going for me: my friends are all rooting for me; I'm really excited for this job; my smoking started out of self-loathe, which basically disappeared over the last 2 days - I haven't had any insane cravings, I'm just acutely aware of the lower amounts of nicotine in my system

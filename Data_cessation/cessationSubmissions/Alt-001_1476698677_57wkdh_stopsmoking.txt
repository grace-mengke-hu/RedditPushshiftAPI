Day two

This is mainly just a gripe, so feel free to ignore it. As yesterday wore on I could not sit still and focus. The up side is I went to the park to walk three times because the weather was nice and I really needed to move. The down side is that I got almost no work done, since I would actually have had to sit at the computer and think about things longer than five seconds. Last night I don't believe I hit a deep sleep the whole time, and woke up randomly at several points. I was so tired when wake time came. Plenty of coffee this morning should help.

And on to day two! I'm ready for it.

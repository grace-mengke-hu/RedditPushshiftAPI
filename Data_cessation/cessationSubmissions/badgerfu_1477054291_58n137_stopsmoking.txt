Diagnosed with Bronchitis/Early Pneumonia: Time to Quit

I was just diagnosed with bronchitis following a cold. I was prescribed medication, but went back to the doctor after a week because it seemed to not improve that much. The doctor took a look at my chart and became [justly] upset with me. She told me that if she asks me to go outside and put out a fire, but she stayed in the woods and kept lighting fires - would it be worth even putting out the fire to begin with? She told me to quit smoking or I would have this cough and the fluid in my lungs for an extremely long time and it may even become permanent. This, of course, scared and worried me. I've been a smoker for 5 years. I'm still quite young and do want to quit, but I am afraid of the cravings. I don't want them. I have quit twice before. 

I don't want this fluid in my lungs anymore and I do want to take care of me. She mentioned Wellbutrin/Zyban. Has anyone had luck with that? I want to be firm on my quitting. My husband said he'll do it with me. My quit date is today. I smoked a couple of cigarettes this morning, but after feeling my lungs just tossed them aside and left them at home. 

I'm honestly worried about my lungs. If I stop smoking immediately, will the permanent damage already be done? :(

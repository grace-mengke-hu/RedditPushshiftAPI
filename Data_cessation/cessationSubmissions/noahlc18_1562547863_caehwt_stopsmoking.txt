I'm buying a Juul to help me quit cigs, then plan on dropping the Juul too.

My plan is to keep my Juuling to a MINIMUM, showing restraint, and only hitting it when my cig cravings get particularly bad. I plan too keep this up until I reach the sweet spot halfway though my body and brain's transition from cigarette to Juul dependancy, and then quitting. The key will obviously be not to overshoot the sweet spot and develop a full-blown Juul addiction. I plan on doing by commiting to an inflexible, drop-dead quit date early in my transition, on which i'll trash my Juul and all left over pods.   


At the end of the day, I'm still gonna have to put my foot down and bite the bullet to beat this thing. But I'm hoping re-commiting to quitting combined with a new approach will better my odd. Anyways I'd love any and all thoughts, insights, or feedback you guys have to offer.

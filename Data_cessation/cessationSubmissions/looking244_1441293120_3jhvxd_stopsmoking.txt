Losing weight and quitting

Hey guys. So I'm on day 5, feeling kinda depressed,empty,lethargic today. It's probably the worst actually. I thought it was supposed to get easier! 

Anyways my plan was to give up smoking first and once it settled 3-4 weeks maybe? Starting to look to lose weight (again) and I need to! I'm just wondering if anyone else has done this, if it's possible? Have u managed to overcome both addictions at the same time? (i really do believe i have a sugar addiction) 

Maybe with today being so hard I'm now wondering if I'll succeed at both. I also thought cuz I'm fat already I wouldn't over eat when I quit because I already overeat! How wrong I was!

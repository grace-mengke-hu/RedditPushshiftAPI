My quitting smoking experience, for whatever it's worth

I (38M) used to smoke. I smoked marlboro methol lights for 10 years (yeah...) and 6 years ago I quit. I smoked 5-10 a day but way more if I were drinking, which I often was.  I quit for a relationship with a woman who was repulsed by smoking.  My attempt was to do it cold turkey. But I often caved and would still smoke one with my morning coffee. Then there were those after meal cravings. I often caved in that first month and would have one here and there. 

After that initial month of cutting back, I did quit cold turkey. I had cravings for a year. Morning Coffee, a cocktail, and after a meal, and even if I saw someone on TV smoking.  But the cravings usually lasted 20 minutes then gone. After a year, I never had another craving again.

I'm really glad I quit smoking. The smell really bothers me now. I did it. So can you, wishing everyone here strength, encouragement, and kindness.

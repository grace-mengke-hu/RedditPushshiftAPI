Please help me want to stop.

Everyone says you have to want to stop, but I don't. 
I recently was diagnosed with cervical cancer without HPV, which I'm told basically assures that smoking caused my cancer. I have to have a full hysterectomy next month.

I haven't quit smoking. 
I don't want to quit smoking.
My husband has begged and nagged in equal turns. Before, when he told me, "I don't want you to die," it sounded melodramatic, but now, I feel like maybe he has a reason to say that. 

The thing is, I don't care. I obviously must care on some level to be posting here, but when I think about dying, it's still this abstract future thing, a "problem for future me." I don't enjoy anything without smoking. I fucking love smoking. I don't have friends, really, but smoking is my best goddamn friend. 

I haven't smoked since yesterday morning. I'm irritated at everything. I hate my husband for wanting me to quit. My head hurts. I feel sick, can't eat anything. I've been feeling suicidal. I'm at work now, so I have to at least appear to be a semi-rational person when checked on, but I feel like I'm falling apart now that I've given up the only thing that helped me cope with existence. But when I run it through my mind, I don't even know why I'm fucking quitting. I know I have cancer and my husband wants me to stop, but I don't know what my buy-in is here. 

Sorry. tl;dr, how do I start /wanting/ to quit smoking?

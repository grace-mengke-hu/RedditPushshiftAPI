Day 1 for Fiance and I

So, my fiance and I finally started the patch on Sunday. It's been my goal this year to quit once and for all. I'm of sound mind in that - once I make it over the initial shock this poison won't be a part of my life ever again and I believe I have the will to make that a reality now. I'm mentally stronger and in a better place than I've ever been.

That said, I've quit before using the patch as NRT, but its been harder this time than before. I'm coming from smoking a pack to a pack and a half a day at 30 years old. I started when I was about 13 and the last 5 years my intake has increased a lot. Today will be my first official day without a cigarette since my last attempt around 6 years ago, having only had 3 a day in the last 4 days. The first few days were an unbearable struggle and I used them as a crutch/pick-me-up. The patch just wasn't enough but I feel better about it now, and removed all temptation from my home.

I thought about posting this to Facebook, but I'm not looking for blind praise or tips from never smokers on how to replace the behavior. Instead I remembered this place and some of the great posts I've found while lurking that have helped with getting motivated to start my quit.

I would like to know - from those who've found success - what are some of the best ways you've found to curb or ignore your cues? I'm finding I have a lot more of them than I realized and I've been stopping to breathe deep for a moment but almost find that it raises my anxiety levels.

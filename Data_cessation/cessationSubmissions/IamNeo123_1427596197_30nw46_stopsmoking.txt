Just turned 19 been smoking since I was age of 16, I think it's time to stop before its too late....

Hey as the title says I have been smoking since I was 16 had a somewhat influence from friends in high school and went a bad path with cigarettes, Its quite funny because I don't even enjoy smoking. Whats even funnier is I could go months or weeks without smoking but then id go on a smoking binge of cartons in a month. So I know I can control it for periods of times which means i'm not truly addicted but i'm getting afraid ill get to the point where i wont be able to stop smoking I know its harmful and very bad for me I just hope this subreddit can help me fight this forever and so I may never smoke another cigarette again. Any Advice would be amazing ty. Also I apologize for the poor grammar since i'm typing on my cell.

Miserable grumpy git today but still not going to give in

dont know what to say just typing to stop the urge.
My wife has gone out not for anything more than to get out of the way of my grumpy moods, I dont blame her if I could get out of my way I would.
I really am a miserable git today but I'm still not giving in.

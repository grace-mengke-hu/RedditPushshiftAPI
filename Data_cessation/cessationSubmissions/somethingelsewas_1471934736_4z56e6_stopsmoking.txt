Bad day.

I quit a few days ago. I've been irrationally angry over stupid stuff, but usually can keep from expressing it.

Today at work they are jackhammering the floor about 100ft from me. Constant. For hours. And this guy will not quit asking me questions, also for hours. Fucking stupid questions. I ran outside as soon as a break time came up and I can smell cigarettes everywhere. A better person would probably walk away, but I'm gonna bask in it and just not bum one. 

It's just almost comically difficult not to snap. Really, a fucking jackhammer?

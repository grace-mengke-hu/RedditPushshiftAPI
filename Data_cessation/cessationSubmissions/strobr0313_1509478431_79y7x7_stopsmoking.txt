Allen Carr Criticism

I've tried quitting several different ways over the last several year.  I tried cutting back, cold turkey, and also the gum with minimal success and several relapses.  I recently read Allen Carr's book and while i found some aspects of it helpful as far as clearing the mental hurdle it helped me realize how many people on here have read it as well after reading comments.  After reading the book it seemed like people who have read it feel like it is the only way to quit.  I went to my doctor a couple of weeks ago and she gave me the nicotine patches which have worked wonders over the last week for me.  I realize that yes, while I still have nicotine in my body the biggest hurdle for me was getting through the withdrawal was when I was in situations where I smoked.  Since I bartend in a bar where smoking is still allowed I cannot completely avoid my biggest trigger.  But I feel that with the patch it has been much easier to get through.  Just here to remind people that anyway of quitting is worth it as long as it helps and for some it may take a combination of several different methods to finally get the monkey off your back.

Oh yeah boiiii!!!!

Hell yeah!!! I had a GREAT fucking day today! Feel like posting here! I kept looking at my app and can't believe it's been 26 days already. It's unreal to me. I feel so much different! I just want to talk about how awesome this feels to everyone, but I can't because they would think I am insane. 

My workouts are so much easier now! I can't believe it! My energy is through the roof. My motivation is super high. I get shit done now! Morning drive to work is pleasurable! I don't open my window to smoke anymore. I don't stink. As crazy as it sounds, I saw a lady smoking in her car today and the thought of having that cigarette after not smoking for longer period made me almost puke. You know that feeling when you didn't smoke for 4 days and then you do it...and it feels like shit? It makes you feel sick? Can't imagine what it would feel like after 26 days. 

What a nasty nasty naaaaassty habit. I want to beat myself up for being so stupid and smoking. Ughh.. I regret it soo much right now. So much money wasted, so much body abuse.. I do not even want to go to that place again.. ever. I don't want this shitty stigma on me. It looks so bad at work. Now I see it. My co-workers leaving the office every hour to smoke. Come back all stinky. Just looks so bad. I wish they would quit.

Can't wait to be in a 6 month, 1 year, 2 years club. I will be doing everything I can in my power to better my self and treat my body right. 

I am going to schedule a visit with my doc to have some tests done. I just want to make sure I am ok. I hope everything is fine. 

Keep at it peeps.. keep at it. Don't fold...keep it going. We are done with this shit!

Got through my first 24 hours.

4 year smoker, 31 years old. Pack a day through most of it. I've been looking for an excuse to quit, and I found one. My friend and I were at his place one night having a cigarette outside, when he pointed something out to me: His kid, looking at us through the glass door, and mimicking our movements, pretending to smoke. He's 4. I immediately felt bad, and tried to hide it as best I could for the rest of the night.

Fast forward a few months later to this weekend. We are now all living together. That pretty much settled it for me. I had my last smoke with my morning coffee yesterday, a few hours before the child moved in.

My first day wasn't quite as hard as I thought it was going to be. Not having one after eating was tough, but I kept myself busy all day and didn't think about it too often. Any time I had a craving I just told myself I'd get over it, and each time I did.

So here I start day 2. I just had my morning coffee, and it wasn't nearly as enjoyable without a smoke. I stood outside as I always do, but I browsed /r/stopsmoking on my phone with my other hand instead of having my cigarette there. I did ok. I'm by myself for most of the day, so it will be a little harder keeping myself occupied. But I know I can do it. I can.

Wish me luck guys, as I am wishing all of you the very best.

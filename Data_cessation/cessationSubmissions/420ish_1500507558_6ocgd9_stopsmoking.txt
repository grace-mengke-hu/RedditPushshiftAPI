Hypnotherapy or electrical stimulation?

Guys, I've tried   I've failed. I tried was successful for four fucking years.  I can't stop not smoking. I see all the success stories here and I'm ashamed that I can't stop. I'm going to give hypnotherapy and or electrical stimulation a shot. It's $250 and I've heard great successes.  I want to stop. I just get so angry I want to die. I want to kill.  I hate everything around me when I quit.  I don't want to feel that way. I also don't want to keep smoking. It sound like I have wet lung already. It's horrible and embarrassing. I stink. I hate it. 

I just bought Alan Carr's book. Going to open it tonight.  I have to get off these things. 
Much love my fellow quitters.

Did you celebrate your 1 year clean anniversary?

I'm coming up to mine and have been thinking about it.  My anniversary falls on a work day; was thinking of buying myself something like a suit or this bose speaker I've been wanting, or taking the day off.  Another part of me thinks I should just go to work pleasantly content and save my money?  What did you do?

Just ripped up my last pack

I've always been a "happy smoker." I don't have a family or SO that doesn't like it. I love cigarettes during work, before bed, after meals, in the morning, pretty much anytime is a good time for some tobacco. I can't stand it anymore. I feel like it's holding me back. I know it smells awful, and I really want to be the best I can be. No more smokes. Let's do it. 

Edit: Guys/Gals I just found my emergency pack in my desk. I want to smoke all of them. Shit.

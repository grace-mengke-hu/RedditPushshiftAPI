Freud had it right, a quote about quitting.

Sigmund Freud quit smoking in 1894, on the topic he wrote:

>The misery of abstinence has been far greater than I ever imagined...suddenly there came a severe cardiac misery, greater than I ever had while smoking. The most violent arrhythmia, constant tension, pressure, burning in the heart region, shooting pains down my left arm...and with it a feeling of depression which took the forms of visions of death.

Pretty accurate for my day 6 so far

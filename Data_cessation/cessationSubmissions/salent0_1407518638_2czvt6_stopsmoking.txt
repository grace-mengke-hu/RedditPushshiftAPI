Quitting smoking has affected my friendships...

I quit smoking cigarettes over three weeks ago using a vape and I'm so happy. I feel great, can smell things, can actually take full, deep breaths. I don't smell bad, I save money. Why didn't I do this forever ago?

But, I think the hardest moment so far is how this has affected some of my friendships. One friend in particular used to smoke a lot of cigarettes with me. We'd just stay up all night chain smoking and hanging out. We even had smoker "alter egos", pretending to use hoarse voices, smoking jokes. It was our "thing". We were the only two smokers in our group of friends, so at any given moment, we'd catch each other's eye from across the room, make the smoking gesture, and get to escape for just 5 minutes. We *always* took smoke breaks together and it was a huge source of our bonding time.

The last time we hung out was my first since quitting. We were all just sitting around and talking, drinking, and I was hitting my vape. At one point, he got up and went outside for a smoke without asking if I wanted to join.

It made me kind of sad. I ended up going out there anyways since it was a nice night, and let him know I would still come outside for "smoke" breaks. He seemed to think there wasn't really any point to it since I don't smoke cigarettes anymore.

It sounds dramatic but it kind of bummed me out a bit.

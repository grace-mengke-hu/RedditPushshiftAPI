WOMEN who have quit smoking- has your cycle changed?

I cannot find ANYTHING relevant about this online and I'm honestly getting worried I am starting menopause or something .

Since sept. I have been off hormonal bc, and once my body readjusted, my cycle has been extremely regular (26, sometimes 27) days since october. 5 days of bleeding, heaviest on day 2, like there is no variation at all. 

It feels like longer but I've only had 3 entire cycles between stopping bc and quitting smoking.

I quit (using nrt) the middle of January, and got my period as expected a day or 2 later. (Jan.14)

Feb.6 (cd24) I had light spotting. I figured it was my period but then the 7th was no clotting just brown spotting. same the next day like very sparse very dry almost crusty blood. (Sorry, tmi) I was a bit worried since my fiance quit too all he seemed to want to do was have sex, and I had myself convinced it was implantation bleeding. The 9th I had no spotting, no af, nothing. Finally the 10th (cd28) she came full force. 


So, onto this month. The 2nd (cd21!!) I had spotting. And then the next day. I thought okay, I guess I just get spotting midway through my cycle. Nope. Now the spotting just turned into a period.

If the spotting in Jan.was my "period'" my cycles are getting shorter and shorter. I thought quitting would help preserve my fertility and I swear my health has just gotten worse in ever way since quitting. Someone please tell me this is normal and not concerning. I don't have any children yet. I am 26. I thought we had time to decide yet.

Made it one month!

After quitting for roughly a year and a half, I started up again. I was not proud of myself, and I won't make excuses - it was a damn stupid thing to do. However, I broke up with the cause of the smoking about a month ago, and my life has 180'd since then. 

I can honestly say that exercise has been my greatest motivation to no longer smoke. I spent 4-5 days a week at the gym, for at least 1.5 hrs per visit. I would never be able to do that were I a smoker. My stamina has increased, and I can now run 1.5 miles without stopping! 

If you're looking for some way to help motivate yourself to stay quit - exercise may be a great one. I also look better than I ever have in my life.

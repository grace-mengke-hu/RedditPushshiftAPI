Just bought my last pouch. Could use some tips and encouragement!

Hello :)

I’m 21, and have been smoking on and off since I was 16. The last time I quit smoking for a significant period of time (about a year) I used vaping to get me off cigarettes. This time, I don’t want to vape. But I also know I can’t just go cold turkey, as that has never worked for me before.

I just bought a 50gram pouch of tobacco, and would like to wean myself off smoking with this pouch. I haven’t figured out yet exactly how I’ll do this, and how I’ll ration them out, and I could definitely use some tips &amp; tricks from you guys!

Thanks for reading :)

How do you guys cope with anger when not smoking?

Hi guys I'm new to this subreddit. Currently 19, been smoking for around 2 years and definitely want to quit smoking because it's pretty expensive in NJ and the winter season is coming up, I don't want to walk around smelling like an ashtray. I have my last pack of Camel Crush's right now, I've quit for around a week before this but relapsed when someone had offered to bum me a cigarette (friend).

I've noticed when I don't smoke I have increased anger, like I get super annoyed. When driving I realized when I had quit smoking that I would get so much road rage and get way too mad at people and put myself and others in dangerous situations. How have you coped with the anger?

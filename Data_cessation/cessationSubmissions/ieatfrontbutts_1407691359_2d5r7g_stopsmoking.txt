Thank god for wisdom teeth.

It's been a week since I had my wisdom teeth removed and therefore been a week since I had my last cigarette.  I don't think I've ever been more thankful to have a painful procedure done because without it I don't think I ever would have had the kickstart necessary to really get me to quit.  Also, finding this sub has been tremendously helpful because when you're surrounded by smokers everyday just reading that other people have gone through or are going through the same shit as you and *succeeded* changes everything.

This time for real. Wish me luck!

Today I bought my last pack. My quit day is tomorrow and while I'm scared, I'm more optimistic that this time I will actually do it. Also, I'm going through one of the most stressful times of my life right now (just moved cross-country, looking for a job in my new city, separation/divorce pending) and my smoking has tripled in the last few weeks. I went from just under a pack a day to 2 packs, and the stress and smoking combo is literally killing me. It's time, reddit. Any words of wisdom and encouragement are welcome.

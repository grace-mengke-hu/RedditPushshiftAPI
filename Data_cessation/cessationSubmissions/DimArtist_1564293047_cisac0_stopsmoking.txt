Day 1: Sleepy and Cranky

I am 31. I used to smoke 1 pack a day. I have tried to quit before this time. Yesterday I was sleepy all day but when I got home the cravings were very intense and I decided to just sleep because I would lose my mind. I also was very angry with many things I usually am not. I am starting to losing my faith. Will this be every day of my life from now on? Because I already hate it. Please help.

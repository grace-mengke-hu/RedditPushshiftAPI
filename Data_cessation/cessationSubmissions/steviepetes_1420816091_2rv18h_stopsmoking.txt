Welcome new quitters!

It will get better, I promise. I wouldn't have believed it in my first month. I have an occasional craving which is a the teeniest of blips that I think my memory causes - I have this visual of me sitting somewhere smoking. It's such a small craving that I can actually just laugh it off. 

My friends, who all knew me as a smoker, now say they can't picture me smoking and that it's weird to think about. I'm right there with them!

I have no interest in ever smoking again. I gained maybe 4 lbs through my quit but have also run 2 half marathons and I'm now in training for a full marathon this fall (and 30k race this spring). I have gained the luxury of never having to interrupt what I'm doing for a craving. The ability to hang out with friends and not go outside for a cigarette, thinking I'm taking a much needed break from people but really just missing out and coming back a smelly mess.

You can do this! The benefits are so huge that I can't keep up with them. Good luck!

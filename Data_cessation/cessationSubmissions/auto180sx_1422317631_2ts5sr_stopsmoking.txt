Day One. Psych Me Up.

I quit for three years about six years ago, cold turkey. Three years later I picked it back up again like a dumb ass.

Today is day one of the second try. I'm going cold turkey again since it worked the first time. It's gone extremely well today! Please just help keep me pumped for the next few days, I know I've got this but support helps. Thanks.

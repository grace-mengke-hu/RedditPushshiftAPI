Chest pains

Hi! Im quitting smoking right now. Ive been getting chest pains for a few months, usually after i smoke, but recently it full blast hurt bad and went to my left arm. Getting lots of symptoms of a heart attack like shallow breathing and exhaustion, fatigue, ect. I got an EKG and it says im fine though and i still need blood work, but i feel not taken serious. I am only 19, been smoking since 16. Pretty freaked. Has anyone quit because of chest pain/a physical reason and it went away/survived? Any similar experiences out there?

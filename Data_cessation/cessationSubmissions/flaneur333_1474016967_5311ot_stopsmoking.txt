Day 12

On my 12th day of not smoking having used the Smokefree app to to give up, kind of on the spur of the moment. have tried lots of things before: patches, inhalers, e-cigs, read Allen Carr a few years ago, did champix (started smoking a couple of weeks after the dosage ended.

After 13 years (I'm 31 now) I have felt for a while like I needed to really commit to it, and to be honest this is the most confident I've ever felt about sticking with it. I think all the other times that I gave up, or tried to, I knew deep down that really I was just giving myself a break, trying to stop the coughing and wheezing for a bit.

I think the most important thing I have this time is willpower. I always thought of willpower as some steely determination, some strength to resist the cravings but now that I feel as though I actually possess some it isn't that. It's the realisation that I don't want to smoke. Its knowing that I can have power over my cravings by drinking water, taking deep breaths. It's knowing I'm not a smoker anymore, and actually feeling that way.

Perhaps I'll falter in the future, and my confidence now will be misplaced. But I don't feel as though I will. I feel healthier than ever, have started running again and I'm sleeping a lot better which has actually reduced my stress levels. 

I would recommend the Smokefree app. It helps to keep focused on giving up, so that's what you think about when you think about smoking. And seeing your progress mapped out in terms of how your health is improving, how much money you're saving is a big motivator. I'd hate to lose that progress.

Good luck everyone, whenever you feel the temptation, or feel as though you can't, just try to enjoy being a non smoker, if you really want it, you can do it.

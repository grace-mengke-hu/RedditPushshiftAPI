Completed Day Three!

I made it through the first round of the icky threes! The most challenging part thus far is waiting for my body to regulate itself without nicotine. Sometimes I can't tell if I'm hungry or craving nicotine. Other times I can't tell if I'm legitimately angry or just hungry. I've also been experiencing some insomnia and restlessness. Later this evening I took a nap and woke up feeling as if I sleep something off. I woke up slightly perky with real hunger pangs that I knew were hunger pangs. The nicotine mind fuckery has been easing all day. I haven't really been craving my lozenges either. Just several times a day I think about them to remind myself I've got them if I need them. 

Looking forward to establishing a new normal that doesn't involve cigarettes or using lozenges at all. I can't wait until I've hit that week marker!

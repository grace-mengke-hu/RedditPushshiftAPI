Bad time for cold turkey? (Possible trigger, warning)

Sorry don't know if I need that warning or not^

Hi, I'm a 25 yo male and I've been smoking for about 10 years. I'm on day one of quitting.I've been wanting to quit for a long time as I think it's gross, and obviously want to be healthier, lots of family has died from it etc. up until yesterday I would fluctuate between a whole pack or half a pack depending on if I was trying to cut back. They were Marl boro reds, the heavy nicotine packed ones

 I have severe anxiety so I truly think that's always been the thing that keeps nicotines hold on me. I have tried before(6 years or so ago) and made it 11 days

Anyways my main reason for asking is that I am engaged and these next few weeks will include venue shopping, as well as other wedding planning things, my fiancées birthday, Mother's Day, lots of things that I really do not want to be irritable for. I do not want to take things out on anyone especially my Fiancée in this crucial part of planning our lives together.

So I guess what I'm asking is should I go about this differently as opposed to continuing cold turkey? How do I explain to my Fiancée that I need to not go cold turkey (if recommend) as promised? Any tips would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!

i have set a quitting date

hello everyone starting December 1st im going to quit smoking! i started smoking on and off around age 14/15 and started to smoke daily at age 16. im 22 years old, thats 6 years of smoking. im not sure how much damage i have done to my body in those 6 years but i hope that if i quit now, my body can repair itself. 

the reason im quitting, i went to my doctor today because i noticed white spots on my tongue and hard spots like 2 weeks ago. it has me super worried that it can be cancer, my doctor told me it could be leukoplakia or something else. i got home and googled leukoplakia and it could become cancer. of what i google the chance of cancer from it is like 25%? if anyone has the hard number of the chance of cancer from leukoplakia, please let me know. i knew smoking could cause cancer but i never thought it would ever get it(sounds stupid doesn't it?) i think having leukoplakia and knowing i could get cancer is what finally kicked it into that what im doing to myself could kill me. 

how am i quitting, well both me and my dad smoke. we both decide not to go out and buy them. we will spend the month we normally spend on cigs on something else. so we won't even have the money to buy them,even if we wanted to. is this a good idea? just quitting cold turkey like that? i never even tried to quit before, i have no idea what its like. closest i came to quit is when i had my knee surgery and i was on painkillers for a week. that whole week went fine, never even wanted a cig. after the pain killers wore off, i started to smoke again. really wish i never started again

sorry if this was a lot of reading, if you could give me any tips/advice for quitting that would be great! i downloaded this app for quitting on my phone and set the date to dec 1st, so i do have a hard quit date.

I told myself I'd never be "one of those people"

I've been a smoker for  about 15 years, attempts at quitting in the past didn't go so great. 
I always said... When I get pregnant.. That's when I'll quit. I hurts my heart seeing  pregnant woman smoke. 
We'll, here I am...pregnant. 
I tried to  ween myself, I read allen carrs book, I drove myself crazy. 
But, it's been 76 hours smoke free. It almost seemed too easy until I got into my car ( talk about a trigger!) 
It doesn't seem real to me that I won't allow myself to smoke for at least 8 months. I keep looking forward to that  far, far away  cigarette. Even though I don't REALLY  want one, ever again. 
This is  such a mind fuck.

Huge day and have no idea how this happened!

So I just hit triple digits! I have never even wanted to quit smoking and was always the friend who was constantly smoking and who people would see as never quitting. I have been smoking a pack a day or more for around 17 years and told myself I loved it and being a smoker was who I was. I made a deal with my mom last year that if she quit (since she is in her late 50s) that I would quit. I worry about her health since she is getting older and honestly don't know what I would do without her. Well she did quit and I kept putting it off, but one morning I woke up and just said fuck it. Like seriously fuck it lets see how long I can go without one. Here I am 100 days later and I don't see myself ever going back. For everyone struggling keep at it and seriously just take it one craving at a time. If you look in my post history I didn't think I was going to make it past day 4 and here I am at 100. I have had lots of relationship issues and stresses that I have wanted to smoke, but never did because I thought to myself, "smoking is going to do nothing for me to make this better". I wasn't happy with myself when I was a smoker so why would I want to go back? Smoking does not improve any aspect of your life, but makes life a lot more miserable the longer you go on smoking. Everyone keep at it because seriously if I can make it this far you can as well!

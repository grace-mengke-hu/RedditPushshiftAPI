Can I quit TODAY?

** I know it really depends on my willpower, but I'd like some insight from more experienced people. I am on my last cigarette of my pack right now. I have off school for a week but I work part time. I have no aids except for an electronic cigarette that hurts my throat. Realistically, can I quit today? I appreciate any advice. 

**I've been chewing gum which I feel has helped. 
** Beyond nicotine, I'm addicted to the activity. I was diagnosed with ADD, take Ritalin, and always need to be doing something.

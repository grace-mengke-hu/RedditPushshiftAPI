My appetite!

Even during my growth spurt, i wasn't this hungry. It could be due to my healthier lifestyle, as I'm walking more and jogging in the morning.

That being said, my breakfast has become as big as my lunch used to be!

Has anyone else noticed this? I feel like its going to end up costing me money to quit smoking because of the amount of groceries! Not saying that's going to make me smoke again, but its crazy!

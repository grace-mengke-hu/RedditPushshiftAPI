Please give an 18 y/o advice!

Well, I've decided I want to quit some bad habits out of my life and I will start by quitting tobacco. 
I am only 18 years old, and I started smoking at age 13, so for the last 5 years I've been smoking non-stop. The first 2 years I smoked around one pack a week, but since 16 I've been smoking consistently around 14 cigs daily. I've tried to quit a handful of times but I get really anxious when not smoking, but I've had enough and I REALLY want to quit. I've read Cold Turkey is by far the most effective method, I already downloaded an app for tracking my progress and tossed all my lighters and all that stuff. 
Is there any particular advice you could give me? Thank y'all.

I stopped smoking a month ago after sixteen years, but I wasn't able to tell myself I had quit until today.

I'm in the process of completing a full body tattoo, minus my throat and face. Twice a year I get four full days of work done. I'd say I'm about 80% finished. Really just my shins, feet, top of the head and right hand left.

Cigarettes were all that I could think about during the sessions. The moment the artist would give me a break, I'd leap up, bleeding and sweating and shaking, and suck down cigarettes until we started again. For some reason I thought it was helping me with the pain and general feelings of sickness that came with that much tattooing. 

Today was my first session without a cigarette. It was tough sure, but something pretty remarkable happened. When we were finished I ate an orange, drank a bottle of water, and I felt fine. I mean, my leg hurts a lot, but I'm not dizzy or nauseous or any of the things that I had come to think of as a normal experience for me.

I thought if anything was going to break me, it was going to be that need for a cigarette after a few hours of pain. Looks like I cleared a hurdle.

To those looking to quit: That obstacle you're dreading might turn into a pleasant surprise.

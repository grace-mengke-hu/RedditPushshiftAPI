Going on day 5 - Journal Update

Hey again, people - I'm sure I don't get huge amounts of readers but hey, I do this for myself! The readers, and upvotes are a bonus!

I went to bead at 9PM last night, and woke up at 4! Normally I SLEEP at 4am! Not sure if it's because of the cigarette, but I know they interfere with sleep. I've been noticing I've been sleeping early and waking up early since quitting!

Since when I woke up until now I realised I haven't had a SINGLE craving, not even a smidge, I even hung out with the neighbour while he was having a cigarette! This is great!

Yesterday though was a bit different, I had a VERY strong craving, but I just remembered the reason I stopped in the first place, FEAR! Not only that, I felt disgusted for days smoking that cigarette after watching those videos.

By the way if anyone needs to pick my brain about why I find it so easy to quit, let me know - I might be able to give you my tips if you're having a hard time!

Day #2, It gets Easier and more Difficult at the same time

I am quickly approaching 48 hours with no cigarette. I looked forward to getting some sleep after the first day just to pass the time of wanting to smoke.

I found myself finishing almost a pack of gum throughout the second day. I considered getting nicotine gum, or patches or champex or pretty much anything, and then decided that I don't want to replace one addiction or habit with another. In addition to this, I dont want nicotine in my system at all anymore.

I watched the [Allen Carr Easy way to stop smoking video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVMyWN54x-U) on youtube last night. I went into it with an open mind, and as much as I got a creepy cult feeling the whole time while watching it, what is said in the video really hit home with me.

A few times throughout the video they tell you to have a smoke if you want to, I decided against it being that I had already made it 24 hours and didnt want to break that streak. I can say that after watching the video I have no desire to smoke. 

Let me clarify, I am craving nicotine. I am REALLY craving nicotine, but I understand that what I am experiencing right now is withdrawal, and the craving of "I need a cigarette" is actually "Give me more nicotine" where cigarette is the only delivery method I know.

This understanding has really helped me to combat the cravings I have gotten in the last 24 hours, as much as I am craving, I am also more and more easily shrugging it off as "just withdrawal". 

I recommend the video for anyone trying to quit, I have found it to really focus my resolve in quitting for good.

Much to my surprise, this morning, the cravings are getting better. I hope I will keep fighting them off with positivity rather than pure spiteful resolve and force of will.

So ends Day #2, hoping day 3 will get even easier.

Almost six weeks a non-smoker

I have to say, I had a really stressful event earlier in the week and my first thought was 'how am I gonna get through this without smoking'? But then I start thinking, whether I smoke or not, it isn't going to change a thing, so I didn't.  The fact that I got through a major stressful event without smoking has really, I feel, strengthened me. I feel good!  :-) 

I decided to reward myself so I cracked open my no smoking savings jar. My husband and I got some great holiday deals and we're heading to Marrakech in January for three nights and we're going to Croatia in April for five nights.  I've also put money by for one year's gym membership.  I'm joining next week. The money I saved in six weeks has paid for both my holidays and a year's gym membership. Some incentive to stay off them eh plus I feel so much better.  Happy days :-)

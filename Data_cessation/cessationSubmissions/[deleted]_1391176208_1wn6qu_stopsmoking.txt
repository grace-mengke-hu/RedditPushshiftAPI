After 2 years of getting drunk before going to bed, I stopped cold turkey yesterday. Plan to stop smoking 2d also, I hope it won't be too hard...

It's weird, I don't really feel any cravings for drinking, but i'd still VERY much like to crack open a beer, right now. It's not an urge, but it would just feel so good. Wasn't able to sleep all night

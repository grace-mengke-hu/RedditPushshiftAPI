Day 15: I've used my quitting as an excuse for isolating myself, gaming and being completely slob.

Hey, I'm back!

It's day 15 and I still feel like absolute shit. I've completely shut off the world around me, and hid from it in fear, because of how I feel. I've felt seriously depersonalized and weird. Like, some of the things I've done has given me serious anxiety because my brain has turned on all the alarms crying "That's not you! You don't do stuff like that! Crazy people do that!". 

And that's how I feel all the time. Crazy. Like I'm losing my mind. I realised I have DP because the only thing that can cure the feeling of the world being unreal, is stuff like crying. When I cry, I know that my feelings are my own. Damn it feels good to cry...

I am seriously scared. I gotta say it. I am terrified. I feel like I'm a split hair from becoming a frothing lunatic who sees faces on the walls. And this all started after I stopped smoking. I crave a cigarette, not because I want them or like them, but because the mental agony is getting to be more than I can handle.

Shouldn't this be over now? What scares me the most is that this isn't caused by cigarettes, but it's been me all along. I'm crazy.

Really bad throat ulcers!

I'm told it's pretty regular for people stopping smoking, but nearing the two week mark I've got a really painful crop of throat ulcers back there! Everything is painful! I can't even eat without a shitload of discomfort! Does anyone have any advice on how to numb it or speed up its recovery??

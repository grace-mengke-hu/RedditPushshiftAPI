So I had a dream a couple days ago...

I see a lot of stories on here about the "smoking dreams" but haven't had any that I remember so far, but the other night I had a dream where everything was going wrong, my ride to the airport was hours late etc. I walked outside, lit a cigarette to smoke while waiting because I was so stressed out and because, well, that's what you do right? You light a cigarette while you're outside.

Anyway, I lit the cigarette, lifted it up to take a drag and before it got to my mouth I thought "OH, I can't do this, damn I forgot I quit smoking" and put the cigarette out on the ground.  Then I thought "Damn I wish I hadn't remembered that I quit until I had at least one puff." but then I thought "Wait, no I don't, if I have that one puff I have to start all over and it's not worth it, I'm glad I remembered in time, not one more puff."

Anyway I thought that was a pretty cool sign that I'm actually internalizing that message.

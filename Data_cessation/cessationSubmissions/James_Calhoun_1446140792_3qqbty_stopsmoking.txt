Depression and feelings of loneliness are hitting hard

Since a few days I feel really empty inside. I have to force myself to get out of bed and start my day, which was pre-quitting not the case. This is accompanied by the feelings of loneliness, which I use to have regulary, but not with the high intensity I'm experiencing it now. It sucks, it makes me sad and needy for a cigarette. I must not cave. I got this!

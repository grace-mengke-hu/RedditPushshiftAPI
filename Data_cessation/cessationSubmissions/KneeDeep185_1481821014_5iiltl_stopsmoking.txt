15 days... and are my teeth getting whiter?!

It's probably just in my head, but I think my smile is a shade whiter. I'd always find that when I smoked in the evening I didn't want to brush my teeth because it would make me taste the shitty smoke taste again.. where if I didn't brush them I could ignore it. The past 2 weeks I've been brushing twice a day and using a whitening rinse and my smile already looks better. Here's to turning 30 smoke free and never looking back.

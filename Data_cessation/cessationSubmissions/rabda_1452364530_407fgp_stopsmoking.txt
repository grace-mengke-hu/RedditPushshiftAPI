It's not too much, but, still, I feel a lot better. My mind is clear and I can focus at what I'm doing, without the need to take breaks so often (every 30 minutes or an hour, as I did when I smoke).
I come here so often to read other people's stories. They are inspiring or at least give me a sense of "We're in this together" and I'm not the only "crazy" person who thinks they are bad, they are not needed and they should not exist. With this, I thank you all people out there sharing your thoughts on your struggles and success of your quits.

Any tips to make it easier?

I’m 20 and am struggling to quit. I tried cutting cold turkey and I was honestly the most miserable I have ever been (I have depression and anxiety so I guess the withdrawal was just too much). I went a day without a cigarette and gave in. I want to quit because in that one day I didn’t touch a cigarette I felt so much better. The day after I started up again, my throat was killing me. So please help?

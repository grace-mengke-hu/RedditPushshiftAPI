Hit 3 days this morning

I've quite a lot before, but this time I'm finding it substantially more difficult. It took me since about mid January of trying to get to this. In the Fall I quit for about 3 weeks pretty spontaneously. I think the triggers are what do it more than anything else. When I quite spontaneously last Fall and this time I was in a new environment. I just went on vacation for a few days and quitting was easy. None of my triggers were there. In the Fall I was in the process of moving, which was quite stressful, but my routine was drastically different day to day.

Now I quit for 3 days, but no triggers were around. Got home last night and I've been Jonesing bad for around the last 6 or so hours. I know it's a terrible idea to smoke one, and I know it doesn't actually help, but I don't know. I still am. I already feel more productive today, but that could also be the small break I just had. Yeah.

Kind words of wisdom or whatever. Am going to try to make it to tomorrow. If I can make it one day resisting the triggers (4 days total), it'll be easier then, no?

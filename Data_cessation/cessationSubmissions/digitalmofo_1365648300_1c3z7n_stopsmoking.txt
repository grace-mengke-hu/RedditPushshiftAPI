Read the book, still haven't stopped. Know I need to.

And I know I can, went all day this past weekend without one.  I felt jittery towards the end, but I know that if I hadn't known I was going to smoke again, I could have crushed it.  It's work that's doing it to me.  It's the fear of missing a smoke on break and having to wait all the way until lunch to have the opportunity again to have a smoke.  I go longer than that every day, but I've had that one at that time for a long time, and that is what is stopping me.  Help!

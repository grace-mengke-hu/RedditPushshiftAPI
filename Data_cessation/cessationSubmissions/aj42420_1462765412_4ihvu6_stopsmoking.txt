I'm struggling to quit!! Need help.

I'm 24 and started smoking really smoking in college to help with the stress. I just graduated and have cut back smoking a lot, but still can't quit. I've tried e cigarettes but those didn't really help. I have bought Allen Carrs book (but haven't read it yet) and i also have bought the gum and started going to the gym. I really want to quit, but I guess I'm just more scared than anything, especially from the withdrawals. And what to do because I'm so used to the habit. I need help and motivation! Please! I don't want to smoke anymore, but at the same time quitting scares me.
Thank you.

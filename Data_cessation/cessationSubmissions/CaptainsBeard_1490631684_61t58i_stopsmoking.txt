I need some support

Hey everyone. I am an 18 year old expat living in Shanghai, China. Because in China cigarettes are so cheap I found myself smoking when I hung out with friends and it began to stick (I don't want to go into detail). I have been smoking for about 2 years now. I used to work out all the time and eat great but now it's the complete opposite. No one else I know knows I smoke like this now. I have had about 20 fights with myself trying not to smoke but I end up doing it any way. I really really don't want to smoke anymore, but I just can't do it :(. At one point I just said to myself "who gives a fuck" and then after I did it, I completely regretted it. I really need some support everyone. I want to drop this habit as fast as possible. I want to be able to not even think about smoking. Please help me out.

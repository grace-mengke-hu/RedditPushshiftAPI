Where's my vaporizer? Oh yeah, I quit....

Just wanted to say that I quit vaping two weeks ago (after quitting smoking again back in March) and I've been getting these moments where I just feel like reaching for my vaporizer and...it's gone. It gets easier every day to identify these moments and to just wait them out - only takes a few seconds or a minute at most. Pretty nifty.

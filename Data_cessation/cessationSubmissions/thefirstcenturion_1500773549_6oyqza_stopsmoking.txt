18 days in, no smoking yet even with stress triggers!

Been 18 days now and I gotta say I'm proud  of myself this is the best I've done with quitting so far. I've had stress from my ex living with me and getting into spats with her, and something else very upsetting for me occurring. Both times I really wanted a smoke, in fact the one day I drove half way to the gas station, realized I didn't have my wallet and took it as a sign to not do it.

I work around smokers and I've found instead of avoiding because I still like the social aspect I can just stand around them and talk with out smoking. Surprisingly they're very good about not tempting me and respecting my decision to quit. 

The cravings have dropped drastically which is great and I feel better physically too. Only problem is I keep eating everything in sight. I've been letting myself get away with the overeating but it's gotta stop soon, so I'll be formulating a plan in the next week to help stop it.

The ultimate test is next month with work where we do 10 days straight, last year I worked 94 hours in a week. That's where I got tripped up last year so here's hoping I can make it through this time.

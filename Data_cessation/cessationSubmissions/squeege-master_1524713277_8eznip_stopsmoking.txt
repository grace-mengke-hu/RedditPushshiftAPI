My reason to quit.

I’m 16 and a sophomore. I’ve only been smoking (vaping) for a month, but I’m hooked. I’m on my school’s crossfit team. I’m worried that if I don’t quit now, I won’t be fit to stay on the team. I only started because of anxiety and stress. I thought it was a better coping method than cutting. Tonight I’m dumping out all of my e juice and selling my mod. I’m hoping that this is the only time I’ll have to quit.

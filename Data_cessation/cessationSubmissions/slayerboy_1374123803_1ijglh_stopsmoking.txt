Still suffering from psychological withdrawals? Try a stress ball.

Seriously. I'm still pretty damn irritable, although with time it's getting better. But I still have those times when I just get so damn irritable that I want to break something.

I found the awesomeness of a stress ball. Doesn't matter what kind you get, I got one from Walmart for $5. Just keep it nearby for when your brain tries to trick you and makes you miserable and squeeze onto that thing with all your might for as long as you need to -- with both hands if you need to.

You might want to get a couple just in case. The one I got a few days ago is already not in the shape of a ball anymore. I almost think this is part of my brain tricking me and also forcing me to go through hell for the last 3 weeks psychologically so that I never smoke again.

Either that or I really am psycho and the nicotine masked it, but either way the stress ball is helping me get through the rough patches.

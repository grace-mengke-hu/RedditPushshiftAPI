Hobbies for someone stopping smoking?

I am trying to help my mother find the motivation to quit smoking. She is a 47 y/o woman whose main concerns about doing so are this; she finds smoking enjoyable and something to do, and she doesn't have many activities or fun things she finds enjoyable outside of that and that it helps with her anxiety.

I've talked to her about anxiety management and we're working together on that but I'm a little stumped about the former point. Can you guys think of any activities or hobbies that she might enjoy taking up? Preferably ones that don't require leaving the house?

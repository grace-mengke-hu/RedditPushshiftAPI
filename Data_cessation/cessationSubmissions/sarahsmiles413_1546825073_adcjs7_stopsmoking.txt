Withdrawal Fears

Last week I decided that I’m finally going to quit smoking and everything was fine at first. No irresistible cravings or anything but after 36 hours without a cigarette I was shaking and extremely light headed and dizzy. I had to be at work in 3 hours and I knew that I couldn’t work that way. I work in customer service and dealing with people is hard enough but I also have to keep my head together and be able to focus on multiple tasks at once. Well, I smoked a cigarette and almost immediately the shaking subsided. My question is, has anyone else experienced this and if so, how do you combat it when you can’t escape the withdrawals?

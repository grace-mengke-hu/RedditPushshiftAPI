Newbies... get in here!

Hang in there! It really does get better! I smoked a pack for 23 years. I just turned 40. That's over half of my life! 

If you are on day 2, 3, 4...just stick to it. You can do this! Get through the first week or two. Take it hour by hour, day by day! You got this. Believe me, it feels AWWWWEEESSSSOMMMEEEEEE!!! Ask any former smoker if they miss smoking. I guarantee you 100% of them will say HELL NO! What other evidence do you need to continue with your quest? 

Your hair will look better, your skin will look better, your breath will be fresh, your gums and your teeth will feel clean. OMG and the lungs...the lungs are just breathing!!!!! You will be able to take those deep deep breaths. It's awesome! You will sleep better, you will have more energy. You will not be grogy...you will get shit done! because you will have energy! You will not waste all that money! Picture having extra 100-200 bucks a month in your pocket! You will be "the shit" and all your smoking friends will envy you. You will feel clean! No more stink. You WILL gain tons of respect at work. You will be looked at differently, in a positive way! You can do this! Stick to it. This is nothing. You got this.

Eliminate triggers, drink shit load of water, be active, stay away from crap food (greasy, fatty, loaded with bad carbs). Clean your body inside out! 

You guys got this! You can do it. You went so far already. Always think....YOU ARE NOT GIVING ANYTHING UP! YOU ARE NOT QUITTING ANYTHING. You are just dropping a nasty habbit that you hate! 

GO GET SOME!

OK, time for me to pump some iron and go for a bicycle ride!

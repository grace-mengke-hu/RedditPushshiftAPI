Smoking cigarettes is driving me batshit

I used to smoke alot and had been nicotine free for 3 years I went on holiday and had a smoke and have been smoking since so roughly 7 weeks. It's driving me mad I can't stop smoking and the more I smoke the more and more agitated I am getting I smoke about 10 a day and I keep having mood swings I know I need to stop but can't stop smoking.il  buy a pack smoke a few and force myself to chuck them then I get insane cravings and end up smoking again. I'm going to go to my Gp and get nicotine gum and try and stop that way. I originally stopped cold turkey but this  time it is more difficult .has anyone had experience with the gum did you find it helpful to quit. Or is the gum just as difficult to stop

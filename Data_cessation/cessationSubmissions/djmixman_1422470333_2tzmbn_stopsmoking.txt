Fight the good fight guys! I'm on 5 1/2 months smoke free and just found this sub.

Just wanted to say hi to everyone. I'm on 5.5 months now smoke free. I am coming off of a 1.5 - 2.5 pack a day smoker for the last 16 years. (Marlboro Reds)

I still have the occasional craving but I think I've learned to do something else when they come about. I think for my 6 month anniversary I will start trying to take off some of this 30 pounds I've added since I've been quit. 

Anyways, I wished I would of found this sub long ago.. I'll stick around and try to provide some support from time to time. :)

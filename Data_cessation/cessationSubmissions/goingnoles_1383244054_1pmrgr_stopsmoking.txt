Some advice please!

Hey, I've been a smoker for about 2 years now and I've finally worked down to 3, then 2, and now 1 cigarette on average per day, meaning there are some days I might smoke 2 and other days none at all. I want to get down to 0 pretty soon but a problem I've found I have from previous attempts is when I start to think, "Ok, I've been off for X days". I want to make quitting something I don't give a whole lot of thought to. Any tips?

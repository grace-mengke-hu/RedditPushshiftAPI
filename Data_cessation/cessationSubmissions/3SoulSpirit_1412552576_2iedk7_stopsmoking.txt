Just smoked my last cigarette....

So, here we go again. Hopefully this will be the last time. 

Ok dramatic entry aside, I'm getting on the wagon again tonight. I've been trying to quit for a while and just recently started using reddit. I figured I would see if they had a quitting smoking sub and here I am. First time poster. Anyways, I quit smoking for just over a month, and then a little over a month ago some life altering circumstances and I took the habit back up. Now, hopefully, being able to talk to other people who are actively pursuing the same goal, I can finally tame this addiction. 
tl;dr I just quit smoking again, and I'm new to reddit.

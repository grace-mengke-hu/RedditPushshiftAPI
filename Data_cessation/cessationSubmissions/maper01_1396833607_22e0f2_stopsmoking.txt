I don´t have to

This is my second post. In the first one, two days ago, I was asking for some advice regarding things I should do to reduce chances of relapsing. Many of the answers I got said work out, or similar things. And it was a good thing because that was the one thing I was doing. 

About a week BEFORE deciding to quit, a friend lent me a treadmill and I started using it. I put it in front of the TV, and spent between one and two hours a day either walking or running. 

So I stopped smoking and kept on with the treadmill. Muscles started to hurt, specially (but not only) those of my legs. Two nights ago I got sick. It was the flu. Cought, fever (99 which is like 1000 to any grown up man), but mostly pain everywhere. That is what fever does, actually. 

The pain was anywhere near unbearable, but it was something, and to make things worst, I was dreaming, and of course, I dreamt about cigarettes. 

One thing you should know about me is that I get sick once a year, and the things that bothers me the most is that I can not feel the taste of the cigarettes. So it is a long week of having one puff, cursing and throwing a perfect non smoked cigarette. 

So there I was the other night, in (some) pain and dreaming about cigarettes, when I came up with something that made me almost happy. Four words: I don´t have to. Because I was recreating that situation in which I lit the cigarette and did not feel anything, and those four words were perfect. I realized I did not have to do that. You see, smoking when sick is something that had bothered me ALWAYS. It was knowing that you were doing something wrong to your body, EVEN FEELING IT and doing it nevertheless. 

But because I´m not a smoker anymore, I DON´T HAVE TO do it. 

It´s like not having to steal because you are not a thief, or not having to lie because you ´re not a liar, etc. 

I´m sorry it was such a long post. Hopefully somebody will understand my idea, and take advantage of it, as I did.

Not sure if my breath is getting worse or I'm just starting to smell my real breath without the cigarette smell.

I'm doing this and no one can tell me otherwise! Also, I feel high. Like im in a state of euphoria. Also, the things that I usually don't notice or easily get bored with, now seems interesting. My attention span is now awfully good. IM ADHD instead of ADD and its great!

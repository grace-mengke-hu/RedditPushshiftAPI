a realization upon quitting for the third time

F 19, smoked a pack a week. 75% marlboros 25% kreteks

First time i quit was just a casual thing and i started smoking again when school started. All my friends in college smoke haha. Second time was during the summer and more health-focused because my boyfriend wanted to be healthy and shit. In high school I had really bad depression. A part of it manifested in hating the physical self-- I used to purge a lot and do a lot of stupid shit. My teeth are bad, haha. Anyway I never really fixed my depression but I guess I am functioning as I do fairly well in one of the top schools of my country. Anyway I remembered that I hated myself so I stopped running, stopped lifting, let that anger simmer in me and get my lungs tight again.

This is my third time. Both times before I still really wanted to smoke and I loved the culture and history of cigarettes. I loved the idea of exploring different flavors and shit. Fuck man its only now that I realize that even if cigarettes have a wide variety of flavor and heaviness and whatnot, they are all the same and sort of disgusting in a way? I'm only seeing this now. I quit on January 8, cold turkey after clearing shit up after a fight with my boyfriend. We're young, but the possibility of a future where I don't kill myself, get married and have kids... its a thought I'm open to. I thought about this further and if ever I decide to pursue this life then it means having to treat my mental issues for good. I am open to that again. Its been hard.

I'm having thoughts...

For the past week I have had thoughts about smoking again. I have been on and off vaping for the past year and a bit and I feel like I really want a cigarette

I don't know what it is. I really want to have one, I haven't had a drag or anything but am really wanting to buy a pack. What are your thoughts?

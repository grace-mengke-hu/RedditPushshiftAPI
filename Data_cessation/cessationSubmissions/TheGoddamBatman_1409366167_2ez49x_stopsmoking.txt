FINE FINE FINE going for it again, starting today

Smoker for something like 20+ years. Quit a while back for the longest period ever for me, about 18 months. Then... started again. With goddam cloves.

Lately I've been going over a pack a day on the cloves (there are only 12 in a pack and they do take forever to smoke).

But... now I'm done. Incidentally, I'm seperated from my wife and so I have a lot of alone time to spend playing video games, going to the gym, etc. I think it's a good environment for quitting.

Anyway, wish me luck!

I consider it quitting, you may not.

So I decided to quit smoking yesterday altogether. I've been dabbling in the realm of quitting for a good month now, but yesterday I decided I was serious. I'm not quitting tobacco though, just smoking.

After researching the health effects of different oral tobaccos, and seeing the change in my energy levels after just one day of using them instead of smoking, I decided to make the switch.

They say that companies put other shit in cigs to make them more addicting. I'm starting to see now that they were right. I  getting my nicotine fix but there's definitely something missing.

I'm sure I won't struggle as hard as some of you guys, but it's a challenge for sure.

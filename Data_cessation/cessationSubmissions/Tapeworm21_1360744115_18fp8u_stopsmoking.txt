Drunken ramblings from a 5 day cold-turkey quitter.

I'm 5 days in "cold turkey," and quitting smoking has been like this:  
(Here are my constant thoughts)

"DUDE!  HAVE A SMOKE!  You're bored!"
"No.  I quit."
"DUDE!  HAVE A SMOKE!  You just had a beer, bro!"
"No.  I quit."
"DUDE!  You're on lunch break!!  Have a smoke!"
"No. I quit."
Then 1/2 hour goes by and haven't thought about a smoke.  This time gap just gets longer, and longer.  1/2 hour turns into 5 days.  5 days turns into 6 months.  6 months turns into forget about cigs all together.  It's a work in progress, I understand this.

I am NOT going back to smoking.  Not on my watch.  Five days in and can already tell you.... fuck no.  Done.  But the experience of quitting smoking is something pretty fun.  It's will power.  You vs. Brain.  Mano-a-mano.  I got my brain in a fucking choke hold and I aint letting go.  I can feel it tapping out right now.  Instead of tapping, it's trying to smoke the resin left inside of my skull.  Fuck you brain.  I even drank tonight for the first time since quitting.  I'm flexing.  Showing you what I am capable of.  If I can get smashed, play video games, and not smoke..... HAHA!  Tonight, I win.

There will be a rematch every fucking day for the rest of my life.  And I will kick your ass each and every time.   You will be Luigi.  Player 2.  The one that never plays unless I die.  This dude ain't going anywhere.  So fuck off Luigi.  Hated that guy anyways... green suspendered-wearing douche.

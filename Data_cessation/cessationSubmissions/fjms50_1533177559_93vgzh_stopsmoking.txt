I smoked after 3 days of quitting

It had been 3 days since i smoked, i felt good, but every hour i was thinking about smoking. A friend came to my house and started smoking infront of me, he didnt know i quit. I dont know if its worth to quit this young, everywhere i go theres people smoking and im afraid i will never get rid of the feeling of wanting to light one one more time.

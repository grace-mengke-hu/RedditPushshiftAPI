I'm so ready to quit but I'm scared to deal with my anger and anxiety.

I'm 25, been smoking a pack a day for about ten years. I'm so sick of it. I'm so fucking done. I would say my main issue with quitting is what a ridiculous asshole I turn into when I don't smoke. Like, I've quit quitting because of how I was treating others. I act so ugly when I'm trying to quit.

How do you deal with the weird withdrawal anger, especially if you work with customers? I just wanna quit and not scream at any innocent people in the meantime or flip out and lose my job. Right now I'm scared to stop because I don't know how I would wind up acting at work. Ughhhh.

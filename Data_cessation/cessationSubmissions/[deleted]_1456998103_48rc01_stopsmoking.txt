I need some advice

SORRY IF THIS ISNT THE PLACE TO BE POSTING IM SITTING ON THE FENCE AND SORRY FOR THE CAPS
I just finished reading Allan Carr's EASYWAY and I found it great and what ever but I'm slightly confused with my situation. Here's how it is. I smoke Gats/Poppers and that is what I'm addicted to. Poppers are tobacco and trees put together inside of a straight stem pipe to give off an almost popping when smoked. I had my last one after finishing the book. Should I quit both substances or only quit smoking tobacco?

Hey guys! I think i'm on my way to doing it!

After starting smoking when i was 14, and watching my uncle and granfather die of lung cancer, then watching my dad struggle with heart and lung issues, i am on my way to quitting for good this time. Im 21 now, but why wait to quit! im on day 4 now, wish me luck fellow quitters. And as a side note, i am quitting cold turkey aswell, i've tried gum and electric cigarettes but they just seemed to make me wanna smoke more. so we will see how this goes!

UPDATE

i dont know what people say they get grumpy or irratated when quitting. im so happy and excited to shit right now! =D

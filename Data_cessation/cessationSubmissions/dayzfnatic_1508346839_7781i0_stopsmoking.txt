Beware the Booze

Me and my buddy quit smoking almost a month ago and while I am still going strong, he relapsed last night. My buddy has always loved to drink, maybe a little too much; anyway, last night while he was super drunk he bummed a smoke off some guy at the bar and he fell off the wagon. My ex-smoker brethren, beware the booze. I am not much of a drinker but for those of you who are be careful because it can happen to you.

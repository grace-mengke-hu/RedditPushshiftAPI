Day 4 cravings are intense

I'm on day four and the cravings today are so intense and almost continuous. What's going on? How long do they last? I've read different things some say they get worse before they get better? 

I've ordered an ecig vape thing on line but it looks so complicated I don't think I will know how to use it. Arghhhh! Words of wisdom, encouragement advice?!

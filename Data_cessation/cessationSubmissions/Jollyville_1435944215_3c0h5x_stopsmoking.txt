Anyone else feel.... dizzy?

I'm on day 5 of quitting (yay!) and yesterday afternoon I started feeling sort of, loopy? Almost like having low blood sugar or a touch of vertigo. Has this happened to anyone else?

I would also like to thank this subreddit for being here. All the positive encouragement is a really great thing!

I'll never be able to have another...

The last time I tried to quit, this thought would strike me with feelings of sadness...a wistful longing for those relaxing moments to myself - escaping the noise and crowds in a bar, driving on long stretches of highway, standing on the covered porch of a cabin by a lake. 

"I'll never be able to have another." 

Now when that thought hits, I remind myself that it's okay. I don't want another. I want to feel healthy and proud of myself for breaking the habit. And that I can still have those relaxing moments, only they'll be better without cigarettes.

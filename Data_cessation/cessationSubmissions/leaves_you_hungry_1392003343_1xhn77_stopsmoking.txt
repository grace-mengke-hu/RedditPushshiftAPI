Feeling incredibly unmotivated since I've stopped smoking.. What can I do?

So I stopped smoking a little over fifty days ago. Yay! That's good. But, I've noticed, in the last month or so, my productivity levels have just completely floored. I'm losing traction on my work, and I'm starting to get overwhelmed. Have any of you faced the same thing? Physically, I feel great. I feel happy. Everything is more vivid. But I'm not able to think creatively or grind out code or analyses like I was just a couple of months ago. If I can't figure something out, I'm afraid I'll start smoking again. Please help!

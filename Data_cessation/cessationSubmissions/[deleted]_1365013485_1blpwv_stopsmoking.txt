Forgot how it feels to not worrying about smoking every second

I might need professional help but before I do, I'm going to put my faith into my fellow redditors. Iv been smoking since i was 16yrs old and I'm 25 now. Is it possible that smoking changed my personality. I cant remember last time i felt good not smoking and not worrying about it. I always thought it was OK, it wasn't that bad of a thing. But iv realized i look alot older, my hair have gotten thinner and i have bags under my eyes and i ask my self why im alone and single. I never had that issue before. I was never this weak and unhealthy and its been 9 years such a long time and so much damage. Iv been blind and stupid and i really want to change. I really need help. I really want to quit smoking *weed*.
Iv become a loner, lazy, lost my motivation and iv been working at the same damn place for 6 years i cant progress because im facinated by getting high the first thing i wake up and last thing before going to sleep. I cant enjoy simple pleasures of life without wanted to smoke a blunt before. Is there anyone out there that felt or feels the same way and want to get out of this ditch

April 14, 2015. Today I stoped smoking.

Just a short story. 

Before I start smoking heavily, i was a very healthy guy, Usually smoked like a pack a month. But then my mother get sick and my smoking habit start to become worse. Know why I stoped smoke today, I want to be that guy again, I was fit and happy and now i'm fat and depressed. I'm tired of not having energy to do what i want. And the first step to stop my depression will be stoping smoking. I will start to wakeboarding again, I'll go back to the gym and be healthy again. Thanks guys, this is the best community reddit or the internet have. You guys are my inspiration to become a better person. Thank you very much.

Sorry for my english,it's not my native thongue. "And I know it's lame".

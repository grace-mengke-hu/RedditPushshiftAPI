Day 14 - NYC stinks

The smells are absolutely awful and I barely want to go outside even for my lunch break.

It's been 14 days with no nicotine. I walked around with a vape in my bag for over a week unintentionally and didn't use it. 

Had a nervous breakdown on days 12 & 13 caused by a toxic family member who refuses to leave me alone. But I did not smoke. 

I've made mistakes at work, let chores go by the way side & slept A LOT but I did not smoke. Even tho it had a hold on me for over 1/2 my life, I will not give up, or give in, I will not allow myself to be a slave to nicotine.  

Friday I will give myself my first reward or as I like to call it, therapy. The cost is around the same as a months worth of cigarettes. But the needles being drags across my skin, the beautiful piece of art that I've dreamt of for years will remind me that I'm as strong as the mighty polar bear.

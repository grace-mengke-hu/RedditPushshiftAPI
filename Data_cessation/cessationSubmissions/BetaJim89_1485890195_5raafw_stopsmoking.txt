Energy spike and loss of appetite?

Hey All!

I am only on day three of quitting Nicotine (was a dipper, not a smoker) but I am a bit surprised at the symptoms, and was wondering if there was any feedback/input anyone  had who experienced the same. 

Note: I plan to monitor this for 7 days and if it persists I will go to the doctor to have blood work done. 

Symptoms: Since stopping nicotine I have had 0 appetite. Like nothing sounds good and I don't feel hungry. I have pretty much been going off of vitamins and water for 3 days now. But what is really weird is my energy levels are off the charts. It feels almost like I took some sort of stimulant. I used to wake up at 7 AM, but now I am up at 5 AM and have so much energy I went for runs all three days. I'm also sleeping soundly, and my heart rate hasn't increased (at least per my fitbit, which I figured would catch any major spikes). 

Anywho: both the loss of appetite and stimulant like alertness seem antithetical to what the standard withdrawal symptoms are...so I'm hoping someone else has experienced it. Maybe it's all in my head. 

And to reiterate again: right now it's a mild curiosity but I do know to go to the doctor should these persist.

3 months 20 days smoke free!

Hi there first time posting but I've lurked since December. I'd really just like to say how great this sub reddit is. I really don't think I was mentally prepared for quiting until I spent a day on here reading people's experiences and advice on how it would be. 

I'm 23 years old but had smoked cigarettes for about 6 years at a pack a day. Having a child now and a girlfriend I want to spend my life with made me want to stop. I really didn't think I'd ever quit and many different points in my life buy sure enough here we are. 

My advice to anyone thinking about quitting is to mentally prepare yourself for the difficulties of the first week or two. Once I got to the third week I felt so insanely proud of myself. Sure there were stressful times and even times where I'd see someone smoking a cigarette and think wow I want that right now. But anytime I thought of smoking a cigarette I would open the smoke free app and look at how much money I've saved and the fact my body is repairing itself from the damages. That's was motivation enough right there to not smoke. 

Okay anyways this is kind of long now so I'll just say thanks for everybody here for being so awesome and supportive you guys rock!

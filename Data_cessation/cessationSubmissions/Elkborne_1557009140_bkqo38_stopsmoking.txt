Swings and roundabouts

I made the decision to stop smoking all together (weed and cigarettes) over a year ago now but the last month has really been when I’ve made a huge dent.

I haven’t smoked any weed for the past month after being stoned nearly everyday for the past two years and one off before, and I’m already feeling so much better. 
- My head is clearer 
- My lungs feel so much lighter
- I’ve started dreaming again!! (This feels like such a win when I don’t remember having one for years)
- I feel much less depressed
- My memory has got so much better

On the cigarette front I’m doing well but I keep getting bogged down. I can cut out cigarettes entirely during the week. I work in a warehouse 9-5 where no one else smokes and I’m busy most of the day. I eat my carrots (my quitting snacks, tyvm someone on this sub), I get home play some video games, make dinner and before I know it, it’s time for bed. But at the weekend I just can’t seem to fill my time enough to fend it off and for the last three (including today) I’ve got out and bought tobacco and then thrown it away at the end.
It feels like an even bigger waste of money now so I’m hoping to stop it completely next weekend.

I’m staying positive though and I’m looking forward to having another wacky dream tonight! 

Onwards and upwards!! :D

So, I smoked yesterday..

Yup. I had a shit day yesterday and late in the evening I ended up smoking one. My bf was super disappointed in me, which isn't a very good feeling. but somehow i am fine. It felt kinda weird having that cig and when I was finished I had a major nicotine flash and i felt dizzy/sick for like the 30min afterwards. After that, when my friends smoked another one later in the evening I absolutely did not feel like smoking again. today is a new day, the sun is out, and i still don't feel like smoking. so, i guess that's good!

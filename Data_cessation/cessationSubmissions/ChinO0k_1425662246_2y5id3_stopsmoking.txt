Day 1!

Last time this year I quit smoking for about 3-4 months. I felt amazing, could breathe better, and was disgusted that I had smoked for so long. I thought for sure I would never smoke again. Well, I relapsed and started smoking again obviously. Today is the day though, I have decided I am going to quit for good this time. I want to live a longer healthier life. I will be turning 28 years old in one month, and I started smoking cigarettes when I was 18. That's  10 years ago!! When I first started smoking I thought I would quit by age 24, that was the plan anyways.

Wish me luck please! Any advice is appreciated as well. I work for a small company and almost everyone here smokes, they even smoke in the warehouse area, and they wouldn't hesitate to give me a smoke if I asked. I need to be very strong.

It's amazing how much these things stink and how much better you get at smelling them when you quit.

I was never a heavy smoker, but I did smoke about 5 cigs a day. In the couple months leading up to when I quit I'd do about 8 on a bad day. Anyway, I quit about a month ago, relapsed, then resolved to stay quit a week later. My last smoke was some time on Christmas Eve, and I haven't had one since (other than a cigar and a joint on NYE; I only want to quit cigarettes anyway since I don't smoke cigars often). 

Last night I went out with my cousins and some friends and at one point we were sitting on a patio with a fair amount of smokers. This morning I put on the same shirt I was wearing last night and was surprised at how much it smelled of smoke. I used to never smell smoke on myself because I was so used to it. That must be what I smelled like to my classmates, only even worse. Wow!

Starting Over

I smoked for years and years.  I got pregnant, quit cold turkey and was fine.  I even made it a year after the baby was born with no smoking.  Then I was just going to have "one".  That was back in August.  So I had started smoking again full time and I have finally made it more then half a day with no smoking.  My new quit forever date is May 1st and I am working on getting my badge updated. 

I am still in that spot where I really miss the smoking. I just want to sit outside and have a smoke, or go down to the smoking section at work and have a smoke break.  My health is terrible and I need to quit, its stupid to smoke. I want to see my son grow up.  Its hard to quit.

On hour 19 no nicotine, first time in I don't know how long.

I'm in explored territory for me now. Been a pack-a-day (plus) for 12.5 years now and have been trying to condition myself to dry heave every time I get a craving or my mind wanders (hnnnggg). been eating regularly but am feeling very lightheaded. 

I'm a little restless and uncomfortable and it feels like I'm getting a sty. What can I expect for sleep tonight?  

Edit: Hour 26, holding steady.

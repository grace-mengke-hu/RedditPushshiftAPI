Tobacco free for over a month guys!!!

I thought I was never going to quit smoking cigarettes. My sister bought the book by allen carr, "easy way to stop smoking" tried it but went back on the shit unfortunately. I still reccomend the book to anyone wanting to be set free from tobacco because it really does help explain what a trap smoking cigarettes is. Woke up a little over a month ago and just said fuck it I don't want to buy another pack then another day, and another... It gets easier. And truth be today I AM vaping, but I don't want to smoke one more cig for the rest of my life. I'm enjoying my freedom from the cold, rainy isolation and the slavery to tobacco. Fuck that shit! I won!!!

Day -5 or -6

Hi,   
  
... I really fucked up. I wrote up a no smoking contract to hold myself accountable. I just bought a pack and over the last few days also had myself loose(but not at a pack a day level).   
  
Consequences:  
  
* Guilt from failing and from hiding this habit from my parents

* Health and financial degradation in various ways  
  
I just bought a pack to smoke with my buddy. When I'm done with my shift today(currently at work), I'll find a way to sell my pack to my buddies. I only think I have 1 or 2 more smokes ahead of my shift.   
    
  Today: Woke up and smoked 2-3 in the morning. 

Thanks for the continued support and I'm looking to start day 1 again today.

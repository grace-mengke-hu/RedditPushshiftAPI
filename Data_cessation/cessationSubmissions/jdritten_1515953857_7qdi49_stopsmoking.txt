Reaching out

Hi everyone,

I'm looking for some advice. I don't smoke at home. I never have and hopefully never will. I can go on vacation for an entire week and not feel the need for a cigarette. However, I work a very stressful job and I can't seem to quit smoking when at work. I really want to quit as it is tearing my marriage apart and I don't know what to do. Any advice?

4 months quit and I'm smoking again.

My dad's dying. He's on life support and we're taking him off tomorrow or Tuesday, it's what he's always said to do. I have to hold together for my mom and kid siblings and this is the only thing that's helping right now. 

I don't know. I just needed to tell someone. I'll update my flair once this is all over

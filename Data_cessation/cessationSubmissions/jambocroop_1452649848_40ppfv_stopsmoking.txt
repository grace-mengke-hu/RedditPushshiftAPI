Going to need some backup

I will be 26 next month and I'm realizing I've been smoking for the better part of 10 years now. I've tried over the past couple years cutting back, switching to vape or another nicotine sources and now I just want to be done with it all. 

It's been almost 2 years since I got free from a crippling addiction to heroin and now I feel like I'm giving my life back over to another substance, nicotine. I've tried to go cold turkey before but I have a good feeling that having some accountability and support in this sub might be just the thing I need. Thank you for being here!

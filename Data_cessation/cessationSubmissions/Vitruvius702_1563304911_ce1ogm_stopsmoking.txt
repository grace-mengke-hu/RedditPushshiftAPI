Day 1

Whelp. Here I am. 

Day one. 

Again.


Last time I quit was probably 3 years ago now... Listen to me, haha "The LAST time I quit...". But it's true. I've quit for a minimum of 6 months at least 5 different times. Even made a couple of years once. 

I've always had pretty good luck with bupropion. It makes it so I don't feel an urge to use nicotine all the time. Today, for example, wasn't planned. I knew I was quitting soon (which is why I went and got a prescription for bupropion), but after unintentionally going half the day without using nicotine already, I just decided to have that free half day headstart. But now that I'm thinking about it, I'm definitely getting those cravings, haha.


Wish me luck!

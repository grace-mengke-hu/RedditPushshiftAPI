Attempting it proper.

Smoked my guts out tonight, enough for me to be sick of it. I could use some help kicking the habit. I currently plan to give my pouch away to a friend and remove the ashtray from my home.

I'm gonna call this Day 1 and my current strategy for cravings is to have a hot tea or coffee when I crave or to write down exactly what I'm feeling. I also have access to nicotine patches, calling them my last resort.

Do you guys have any tips or suggestions for me?

My son needs this.

I'm getting my wisdom teeth surgically removed tomorrow--this is the perfect time to quit cold turkey, right?  
   
I'm a new mom of a 3.5 month old son and I returned to smoking 1 month ago.  I hate it and I'm so ashamed of myself.  I've smoked since I was 15 years old--now 30, I have quit 6 times since the start--I've quit by using the patch, gum, wellbutrin, vaping, and nothing has helped me gain complete freedom from a smoke.  
  
I'm a total closet smoker--the shame is unbearable.  Every time someone that I know busts me smoking, and they have a shocked response of "I didn't know you smoked!?" with a disappointed look on their face, I get so embarrassed and begin to cry.  I can't help but cry from the deep disappointment and shame that I have in myself!  How dare I stay smoke free during pregnancy, while not even thinking of or desiring a cigarette for 9 months, and then give birth to my ultimate responsibility only to start smoking again!  I HATE THIS.  Sure, I only smoke a pack every 3 days...Sure, I truly enjoy and need those 10 minutes to have for myself--away from my son and the non-stop duties that come with parenting...Sure, I know I can "just quit again"...but I am struggling so badly...I WANT TO STOP FOREVER.  Y'all, I breastfeed my son and I feel like I'm putting my smoke funk all over him.  He doesn't deserve that!  He's a precious, sweet smelling, pure, tiny human and I am tainting that with a terrible addiction!  It makes me nauseous just thinking about it.  It makes me sick to think of such a wonderful son growing up in a household of smokers.  I don't know why I'm telling you all of this, but I want to start fresh tomorrow.  I want my last cigarette for *eternity* to be tonight before bed.  I want to wake up from my surgery tomorrow afternoon and stop...**forever.**

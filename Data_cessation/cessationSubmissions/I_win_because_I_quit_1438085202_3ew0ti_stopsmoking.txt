Three months = new badge

I can't believe it's been three months for me now. It's been one helluva ride so far but it's been worth it. I can laugh without coughing, I don't feel like crap when I wake up in the mornings, I don't have the stress of hiding it any more, and a ton of more benefits. Thanks to everyone that's helped me get this far!

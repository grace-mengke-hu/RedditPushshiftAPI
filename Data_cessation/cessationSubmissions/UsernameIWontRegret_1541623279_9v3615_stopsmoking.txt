Why do the urges get greater the longer I quit?

I'm 22, was only a smoker for three years, but was at a pack a day for most of that time. 

I'm at 5 and a half months without a cigarette, three and a half months since any nicotine. Right around three months I felt a complete release from the captivity of nicotine addiction. Didn't think about it, didn't crave it, nothing. I thought I was free from the hell.

But over the past several weeks it's been gaining in intensity. So much so that I've thought about going back to smoking. I think I've forgotten all of the bad and only remember the nostalgia of it. I started smoking during the best time of my life, and it was right around this season too. It's ironic knowing I started smoking during the height of my life but it was me smoking that took it all away.

I don't know. To those of you who are further than me, does it ever get easier? Or will I forever keep thinking about smoking?

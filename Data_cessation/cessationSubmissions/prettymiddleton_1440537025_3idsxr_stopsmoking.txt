Totally crying like a baby

It is day 14 and I smoked for 25 years. It had been easier than I thought however idiotic things keep making me cry
  Not like sobbing messy cry but tears and the feeling of despair and ennui. Totally not like me I am a very pragmatic sort normally happy and optimistic. Please reassure me that this is temporary xxo

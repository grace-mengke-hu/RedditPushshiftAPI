Should I wait until I finished my finals?

I'm almost done reading Allen Carr's book. Right now I'm at chapter 26 where he suggests you plan out three weeks that aren't too stressful. My finals will start in late January and will be due in late February. So how bad is this going to be? Should I wait the whole time and stop after that?

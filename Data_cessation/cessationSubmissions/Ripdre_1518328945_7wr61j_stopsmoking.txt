Not addicted to cigs.. addicted to nicotine?

I'm curious on your collective opinions on this. I've smoked cigarettes but I never honestly got into them, but when ecigs were the trend for the year I was hooked on 65mg juices. I know this sub is for quitting cigs and not necessarily nicotine but I was wondering what you're thoughts were on this. I felt a lot weaker then a lot of people on this sub because I always reasoned nicotine couldn't possibly be that bad for you, but the WD for the first 2 weeks were on of the most hellish things i've ever been through, I didn't know how hooked I was on it then I thought. What do you guys think about this? Does being addicted to nicotine but not addicted to cigs still justifiable for this sub?

Day 5 and it's raining

Us smokers tend to have favorite times and places to smoke at. Mine is actually a rainy day such as today, at home. Sipping some coffee while listening to calm, mellow music while I exhale my worries away. 
Thats not happening today. 
I'm on day 5 since I quit and I already notice an increased sense of smell and taste. Last night someone was smoking near me and the smell of cigarettes repulsed me and even made me dizzy. 
I am thankful that I have taken this decision, the problem is that I have taken it many times before and eventually fall off the wagon. 

I decided to quit smoking because the stench was killing me. My breath was horrible. My pores screamed help me. My hair was a vaporized ash tray. My lips turned black from all nighters. People didnt find my scent pleasant. I didnt find my own scent pleasant. The anxiety to first thing in the morning have a drag off a substance whose ultimate purpose is to kill me. To see if by quitting cigarettes I can abstain from drugs and alcohol (another weakness) 
To feel human again. My days were a routine which I got fed up with. My days revolved around cigarettes and mind altering substances. That's not a life I want to keep living. 

I'm somewhat depressed today. Could be the rain or my hormones, but my body and brain seem to be missing smoking. Its all a lie I'm aware.. yet here I am, with a lemon tea ready to be sipped to distract my obvious desire to intoxicate my detoxifying system. 

On reddit to see if someone can shed some light on how to overcome this craving

Help.

Just realized that I've passed 90 days

I've been doing so well smoke free that I didn't even realize how long I had gone without nicotine. Every now and again when I get super stressed I think about having a smoke and then tell myself no. It's getting exponentially easier. I can even have a drink or two without a craving.  When I'm around smokers the smell makes me queasy, it doesn't give me a craving. 

I've kicked the habit for good this time :)

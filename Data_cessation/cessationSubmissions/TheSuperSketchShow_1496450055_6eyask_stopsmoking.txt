Willing to quit smoking because: "Tobacco is foul" ~ Travis Scott

Hello everyone, like the title says I really want to quit smoking.. I don't smoke that much at all but it's just starting to annoy me. Right now I'm at 5-10 cigarettes a day and I'm afraid it might become more so that's why I'm here I guess. My last cigarette was an hour ago and I enjoyed it. It doesn't really feel that I'm addicted, I can go a day or maybe two without them but I just feel "chill" when smoking? Does that even make sense? It actually hurts when I'm smoking (sometimes the burnzzz). Well I'm open for advice and some thoughts of the reddit community! 

Thanks in advance!

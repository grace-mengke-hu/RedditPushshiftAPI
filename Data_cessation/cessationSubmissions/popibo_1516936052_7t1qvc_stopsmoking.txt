Popping mints not cigarettes worked

Not vapes, nico gum, or any of the sort. Leading up to my quit date I would count the number of cigarettes I smoked, by having a mint at the end of each one. I'm a teacher so it was important to me that my breath didn't reak by the end of the day. At first, I'd pack 10 mints a day, which translated to 10 cigarettes, which I would slowly as time progressed decrease. If I was out of mints, that meant I had smoked all the cigarettes I had allowed myself for the day. The day I quit, without even noticing it, I would easily cure my cravings by simply popping a mint. Now my breath is x2 as fresh and quitting seemed all that much easier. 

This may or may not help some of you, but just thought my 2 cents could be worth something. Good luck!

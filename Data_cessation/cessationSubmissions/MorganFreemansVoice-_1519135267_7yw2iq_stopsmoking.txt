Just looking for some advice.

I smoke about 4-5 times a day
I haven’t had a smoke in the last two days.
I’ve noticed I’ve been really just a little cranky and irritated more often and it’s my first time quitting making it past day 1. I don’t want to depend on a smoke whenever I feel depressed or stressed out when I know it can have health issues. 
It’s hard and Ive been googling ways to help 
Many people say keep something to snack on to keep your hands busy ect like chips or a healthy snack 
Just to give your hands something to do when you have a craving for a smoke.

Idk, I guess I’m just wondering if anyone has other methods they’ve used to help them stop. I’ve tried asking family but they don’t really understand how hard it is to really stop smoking without caving in.
I would appreciate it,
Thank you

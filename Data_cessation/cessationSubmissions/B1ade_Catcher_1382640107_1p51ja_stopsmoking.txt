Addiction makes me an ass I'm pretty sure.

So yesterday in confidence I told my friend up at college not to give me a cigarette if i asked for one today. I was fine last night but today was a whole new animal.  The reason I don't have tobacco is because I'm trying to quit. Well. Turns out he actually stuck to that. And I got mad when he wouldn't give me a cigarette. Not only am I not entitled to his cigarettes, but he was doing exactly what I asked him to & what was good for me. I have since apologized but thank goodness I still have resolve. All of this made me realize how much of a slave I really am. That wasn't me acting in self control at all. 
So here's to sticking to quitting.

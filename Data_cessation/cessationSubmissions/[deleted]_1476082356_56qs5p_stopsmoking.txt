Three weeks

and the worst seems to be over. I can't believe it, I used to be so dependent on nicotine and the comfort of lighting up a cigarette, like I couldn't imagine life without it. I dreamed about quitting but never made a serious attempt til now. I feel done with it. I crave  a few times a day but I really truly know within myself that the benefits of quitting are far better than the benefits of smoking and that makes all the difference. Breathing is clean and easy, my body is warmer, my skin and hair looks better, I have incredible energy and the pain my chest is gone. It is when you get to the point where you really feel like you are done smoking you see how ridiculous it is. 

I am so happy and proud of myself.

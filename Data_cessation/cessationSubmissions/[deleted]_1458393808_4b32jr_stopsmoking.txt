Keep on keeping on!

Got my 3 week flair today! In celebration I thought I'd share a song that has meant a lot to me during this quit. I'd never heard of this band until recently but the lyrics are spot-on for those of us quitters who struggled to find the silver lining during the first week or so. To all of you finding it hard right now, listen to the words, feel the music and Keep on keeping on! The best is yet to come. Happy Saturday folks X

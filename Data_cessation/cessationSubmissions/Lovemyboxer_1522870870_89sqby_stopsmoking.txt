I’ve quit so many time

I’ve been smoking since I was 14 years old. I’m now in my mid 40’s. I’ve quit many times over the years.  My pregnancy’s.  After a major surgery, I quit for 2 years.  

I work in the medical field. I know what tabacco does to your lungs, your heart, your body. 

Today is day 3.  I’m doing ok. Every time I think of smoking, I tell myself no.  Just sucks to have this addiction, and I’m tired of the self loathing because of cigarettes.

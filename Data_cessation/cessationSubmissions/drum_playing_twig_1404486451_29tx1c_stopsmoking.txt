I have not smoked for 35 days. Please convince me that smoking a cigarette now won't feel as good as I remember it

So when you're a smoker you think cigarettes make you feel great, when in actuality they just make you not feel shitty. In any case, that "not feeling shitty" feeling was awesome and I hate that I remember it being so good.

Now, after 35 days of not even having a puff, I kinda miss it... and I hate that I do. 

**My main question I guess is:** Just physically speaking, how would smoking a cigarette feel right now for me? Would it be like the first cigarette after work used to be, where all the problems in the world seemed so small for those few minutes? Or would I just cough, hate the taste and feel naseous?

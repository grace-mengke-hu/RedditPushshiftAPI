Day 10 at re-quit. Feels like collapsing down.

Dude i was perfectly fine for first 1 week but last 3 days i am very tired, sneezing all the time.
I was not be able to do my chores yesterday. Today i don't want to attend for any of them.
This lazy version of myself is making me crazy.
My willpower dropping down as speed of light.
My decision fatigues too. 
Red code, red code help!

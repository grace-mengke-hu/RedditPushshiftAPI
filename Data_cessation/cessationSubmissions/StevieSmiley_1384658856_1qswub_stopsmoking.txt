Mayo

Today for lunch I decided to make a tuna fish sandwich. Usually I don't care much for them. It's just something readily available, and today was no different. Just your average routine and mundane. 

After adding the Mayo, I decided to lick the spoon and was blown away with how great this shit tasted, as well as how many of the ingredients in it i could identify. I then decided to add double the amount to my tuna sandwiches. Sadly, it was now a sloppy mess, but did taste great none-the-less. 

Just one of the many new achievements I've earned in the non-smoking game.

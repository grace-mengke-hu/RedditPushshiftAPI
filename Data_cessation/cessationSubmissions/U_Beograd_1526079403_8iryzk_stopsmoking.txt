Binge smoked this evening and feel awful.

I went 5 days without smoking and I just smoked half a pack in a few hours and feel awful. I want to throw away the pack but also want to keep it if I want to smoke more but I know I don't want to. I feel I've failed and messed everything up and it's really getting to me.

Sorry if this is a common thing on this thread or sounds stupid. Does anyone have any advice? I really want to stop and I'm sick of my mind wanting cigarettes and having them control me when I know I'm stronger than that.

Thanks

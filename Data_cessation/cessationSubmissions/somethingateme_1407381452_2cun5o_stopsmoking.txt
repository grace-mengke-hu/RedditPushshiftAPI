Issues and questions

1st the questions:
How long before I can call myself a nonsmoker?  There is a possibility that I could get a new job and that would mean new health insurance.  Can I legally tell them I am a non smoker?

issue:
The cravings are back.  I went days without really wanting a smoke, but lately I can't seem to go a few hours before I am jonesing.  Is this normal? 

The achievement, I met a friend at a bar that is not smoke free.  I wanted a smoke, was offered a smoke, but refused to partake.

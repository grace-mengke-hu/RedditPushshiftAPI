Anyone sick when quitting?

On the first day I quit I’ve developed a massive cold with green mucous, headaches, coughing, short breath and tiredness. Anyone else’s health crash when they gave up? I’ve been off cigarettes for five days now. Four days sick. It’s not like I’m complaining, i mean I definitely prefer no cravings for smokes (i can barely breathe as it is) but it sucks feeling crap.

"Vaping isn't smoking"

 - Says my nicotine riddled brain.

"You can have an ecig" - Says my nicotine dependent brain

"It's better for you" - Says my scumbag brain

I fucking hate that these things exist.  They are going to be my downfall.  I have been obsessed with them the last few days.  Posts keep showing up, with people using them.  Fuckin fuck man....

I don't want to fail :(

I keep eating

This is my nth attempt to quit. hopefully the last one.
The problem is (now and previous times) that I eat a lot.
Junk, chips, chocolates, nuts, food. I just eat and eat.
Wanted to know if anyone here has gone through same and if yes, any suggestions what to munch on rather than chips or chocolates

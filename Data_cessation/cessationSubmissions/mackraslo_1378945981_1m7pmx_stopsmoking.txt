Will I relapse into smoking tobacco if I smoke the occasional joint? :S

Thanks for reading, I am 99% sure of myself that I will not relapse into smoking tobacco if I smoke the occasional joint.  The joint is for pain and insomnia, not going out partying or with anyone, so I will be alone.  I guess I am nervous since I am 78 days smoke free and tend to worry a lot.  Any advice, comments, and thoughts are very appreciated.  Thanks!!

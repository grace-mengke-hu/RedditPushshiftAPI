Just sitting here this morning.

So yesterday I got some junk mail from a store. And with it had these little scratch and sniff perfumes. Well except you don't actually scratch them. you just pull 2 layers of paper apart. Anyway,  I thought they smelled nice, so left them sitting on my desk cause I like "smellys"  sometimes now. I take walks just to smell the jasmine in the area. Anyway I never noticed how strong just a sampler paper could be. Just sitting here I can smell the fragrance. 

If you're a long time smoker like I was, Smell could be a great motivation for you. Even after only a few days of smoking cessation, those scents start screaming at your nose. You might not now notice anything even wrong with your ability to smell. Or just ignored it. Try to remember some places in your youth that carried distinct smells. When's the last time you had that  kind of experience with smell?  

Oh god, I smell bacon now... later

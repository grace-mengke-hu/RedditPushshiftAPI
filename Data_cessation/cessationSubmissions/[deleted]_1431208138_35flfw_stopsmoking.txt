I've gone from 20+ a day to around 5 a week with the help of a vaporiser. When I now smoke I get bad headaches and a tightness in my chest. Is this normal?

I struggle with weekday (work) mornings and sometimes buy a packet, smoke 1 and chuck the rest in the bin. A stupid and costly habit i'm trying to break.

I've had a few anxiety attacks (including chest muscle twitches which scared the shit out of me at first) and mild headaches that last a few minutes while using a vaporiser. But when i do smoke I get 'flashing' headaches and a tightness in my chest. I gather its just my lungs fighting against the smoke and a rising heartbeat, but just wanted to be sure it wasn't something to worry about.

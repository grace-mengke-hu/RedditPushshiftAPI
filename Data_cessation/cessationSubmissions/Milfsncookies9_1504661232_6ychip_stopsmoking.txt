Failed Day 1

Hey guys, new here. This is my umpteenth time trying to quit. I quit smoking for vaping a few years back, but I've had the vape in my hand constantly, all day, every day since then. I've been reading a book about Habits, which motivated me to attempt to quit again. I've been attempting to identify my habit triggers, but because I just vaped all day, anywhere, any time, I can't seem to find any specific triggers. I just know that after about an hour without a puff of vape, I start getting a tingling feeling in the back of my mind, tunnel vision, and my only thought is that I need nicotine NOW. I'm in good shape, i exercise regularly, and lift weights (Also active duty military), but previously after each workout, I would take a few drags of the vape immediately after walking out of the gym. So exercise only reminds me of what I'm missing out on after the work out. I failed today, ended up vaping about 5 times taking about 3 drags each time. Even though that's progress, I was aiming for cold turkey. 

Tomorrow I'm not going to take my vape to work. The hard part will be not bumming a drag of a cigarette off someone, or something of that nature. Wish me luck. I plan to be active on here now! Thanks in advance for the support!!

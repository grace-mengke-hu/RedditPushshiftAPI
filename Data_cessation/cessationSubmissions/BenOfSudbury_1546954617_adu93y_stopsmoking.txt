You are doing great!

Hey everyone. 

&amp;#x200B;

Stumbled on this sub today and wanted to post and say hello, and to tell you all how well you're doing.

&amp;#x200B;

I smoked for 15 years and stopped 10 years ago, so I know how it goes. I'm now a stop smoking therapist and I wish all my clients were as determined as you!

Seeing you all so determined and motivated is really awesome, keep going, you can do it!

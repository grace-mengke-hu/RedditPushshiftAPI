NEVER GIVE UP!!! "May his soul rest in peace"

I wanted to share my true story.. I'm 20 years old , i've been smoking for 4 years , but i decided to quit and i won't come back again! .. My father passed away this week he had heart attack from smoking.. And left me and my mother and my sisters alone, he won't see me get married or even see my graduation or see my sister's new borns.. We will face the world alone :S .. Even he were do sports everyday, don't trick yourself .. Doing sports and smoking is really dangerous.. So i've decided not to do the same MISTAKE he did and i quit , and i won't count the days .. Quit not even for urself ...for you're future wife or future children  .. Rest in peace dad , may god forgive you .

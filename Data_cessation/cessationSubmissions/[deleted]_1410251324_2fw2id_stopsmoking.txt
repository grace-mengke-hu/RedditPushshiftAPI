One Week Later

Coming up on one week cigarette/alcohol/soda/ADHD meds free and feel good. I decided to give up smoking for good last week and so wanted to go no drinking or ADHD meds for 30 days as they increase my urge to smoke. Wanted to do soda as well because working behind the bar leads me to making delicious sodas with our syrups. Too much sugar.

One week later, no real desire to smoke a cigarette. Increased intake of marijuana to keep cravings at bay. Marijuana has the awesome effect of making me cringe at the thought of smoking tobacco and drinking alcohol. My marijuana is vaporized in an effort to increase lung health by reducing combustible smoke ingestion. 

Tomorrow I must begin taking ADHD medication again. I cannot function in an academic setting without it so tomorrow will be the true test. Im not even worried about it though. I honestly feel like my will power is strong enough in only these 6 days.

For the first time since I was 15 I finally consider myself a non-smoker and am comfortable saying that. I hope this ease continues and I can put the past behind me. Cheers to longer, healthier lives.

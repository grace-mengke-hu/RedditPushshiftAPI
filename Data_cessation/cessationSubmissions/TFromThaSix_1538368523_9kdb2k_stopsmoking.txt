Day 6 and struggling with bouts of anger

Going on Day 6 here, I quit smoking marijuana &amp; cigarettes the cold turkey in the same day. It's been relatively easy up until today, I've always been a calm, cool &amp; collected person but ***EVERYTHING*** pissed me off today, to the point that I told my manager and coworkers to all fuck off in front of a bunch of customers after being told I now work on a day I was supposed to have off which may not sound too severe but that's not like me at all. My manager recognized it was withdrawals as she's a smoker and gave me some nicotine gum which definitely helped but it was making me angry that I relied on gum to calm me down which I know isn't rational. When I got home from work my mouse was tangled up with my keyboard which set me off causing me to swat everything off my dresser. Even as I'm making this post I can feel the rage going through me, it's fucked. 

If you've experienced anything similar what did you do to help overcome the anger?

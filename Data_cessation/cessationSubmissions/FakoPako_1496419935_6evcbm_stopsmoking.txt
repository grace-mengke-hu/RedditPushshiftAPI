518 days

Damn, time flies. I can't believe I am non-smoker. 518 days today. I stopped counting, but this sub popped in my favs so I thought I would drop in. This is the longest I went not smoking. Believe me, I am not planning or have ANY desire to smoke again. I tried to quit so many times that I got sick of counting. This is the longest New Year resolution I will ever keep - to the rest of my life. 

I started to smoke when I was 16 to be cool. I quit on January 1st 2016, your typical quitting date other than every monday. On January 4th, I turned 41, so I smoked for more than half of my life, pack a day. You can imagine the habit change it was for me. No more smoking on the way to work, no more going downstairs at work to puff on those things, etc. All my routines changed. 

But I couldn't be happier. You all know smoking is bad. We know that while we smoke. We all want to quit while smoking. I tell you, the benefits are AMAZING. My oral hygiene improved immensely. My dentist even said it. My teeth are nice and white, and gum are nice and pink. They don't freaking bleed anymore. I don't have shit stuck in them anymore. My clothes smell nice, my skin on my face glows. I don't smell anymore. 

The negatives? None. Absolutely none. 

Stick to it. It is sooooo worth it. You will not even think about smoking before you know it. You will have no desire what so ever to ever smoke again. Then you run into your smoking friends after they are done smoking, and you will wonder, why the hell are they doing it to them self. it stinks. It smells really bad. 

Good luck! You can do it. If I did, you can too.

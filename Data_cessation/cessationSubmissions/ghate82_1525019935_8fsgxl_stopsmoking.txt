Proud of myself

So a friend had a birthday party last night. I went with the intention not to drink so i didnt tempt myself to smoke. I gave in to a few beers but resisted smoking all night! So far ive had the best hangover ive ever had (is that an oxymoron?) And dont feel and smell like an ashtray. Now i know i have this shit beat!!

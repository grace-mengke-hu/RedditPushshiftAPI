40 days

40 days without a single cigarette, and I did it cold turkey! I tried quitting with patches before, and it didn't seem to do much for me. 

I feel like you really need to want to quit in order to be successful, not because somebody else wants you too or other outside factors. It wasn't without temptation either as all three of my roommates are smokers. But at the end of it all it was so worth the struggle! It's funny how after just 40 days, I don't identify as a smoker anymore and struggle to understand how I ever was.

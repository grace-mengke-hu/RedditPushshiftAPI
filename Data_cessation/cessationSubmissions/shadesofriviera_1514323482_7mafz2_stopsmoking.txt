How do you get past your cravings?

What’s your go to method for coping with cravings? 

I use the smoke free app and it’s been amazing so far. In the past I have quit many times before, ranging from a few days to 8 months at a time but I always seem to fall back to smoking. I would always tell myself it’s because I “@&amp;$ing love smoking but I feel as though that might have been a bit of a cop out or some form of self enablement.  So I’m trying to tel myself that I used to really enjoy smoking but now I really enjoy being smoke free. 

With New Years coming up I’m very aware that this is probably going to be one of the hardest challenges I’m going to face. I would love to hear all and any of your methods of getting through those intense cravings. So that I can head into NYs with a whole lot of skills.

Sorry for rambling! Hope you all are enjoying your Christmas break!

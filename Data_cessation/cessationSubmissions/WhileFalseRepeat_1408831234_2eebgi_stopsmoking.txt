Phuckin Dreamz And Shite

I haven't had any smoking dreams until last night. It was extremely vivid and I hate to say it felt really fucking good to smoke in the dream. I'm worried this is an indication I have serious chinks in my armor. For most of my quit and especially in the beginning I feel I may have enjoyed the "hurt". I have some self hatred issues and the hell of withdrawal, suffering, and subsequent cravings was somehow enjoyable to me (in a completely fucked up way). Now it seems to be a different type of battle than it was in the beginning. It is no longer a constant barrage of urges/cravings/withdrawal and I find no joy in the suffering that remains. The battle has somehow become even more insidious because I am now prone to depressive episodes which weaken me and make me vulnerable. I have been fighting nostalgic and/or romanticizing thoughts about cigarettes lately and I think this dream was a warning to me that I need to get my shit together.

My boyfriend has been lying to me about quitting for half a year.

Hey guys! So as you can see from my badge, I can proudly say it's been almost half a year since my last smoke, and it has a lot to do with you all, so thank you.  Things haven't always been easy, but it's been way easier than I ever thought it could be, and I'm never looking back.


But today I found a pack of cigs in my boyfriend's computer bag. I confronted him about it. We had originally quit together, but as it so happens, it was only me that actually quit. After several other lies, he confessed that he is still smoking and was hoping he'd quit before I found out.


I feel so dumb and hurt that he lied to me. What do I do at this point? He says he wants to quit. How can I help? How can I trust him again?


EDIT: I knew I could count on you guys for some great feedback. He's 100% on board with quitting, and I'm gonna help the best I can. I know he can do it, and now he knows I am here to support him. Thanks everyone for your responses!! You guys are the best :)

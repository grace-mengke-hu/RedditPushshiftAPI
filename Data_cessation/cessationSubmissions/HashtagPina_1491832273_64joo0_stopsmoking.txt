Day One! Attempt two. Any suggestions?

I've been smoking steady for 9 years - my first attempt quitting was January 23rd, which lasted three weeks. Today I quit again. Wish me luck!! Any suggestions? Just bought the Allan Carr audiobook.. will be drinking a ton of water and herbal teas.. downloaded the Quit Pro app... been reading all of the motivating posts on here. Anything else that might help me? Thank you all!!

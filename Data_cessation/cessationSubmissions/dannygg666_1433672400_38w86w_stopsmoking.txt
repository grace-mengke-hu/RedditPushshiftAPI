I CAN DO IT!

Hello fellow quitters. I am 16 year old and i have been smoking for a year and a half. I smoke usually about 6-10 cigarettes max a day. A week ago i smoked a pack and i noticed that i couldn't get enough air and when i breathe my lungs hurt. I felt my lungs very weird since then. The other day i started coughing and getting some sh1t out of my lungs. I smoked allot that day and the pain is back. Now i cant really breathe allot because my lungs hurt and i cough something out. Plus when i breathe my lungs make a really weird squeeky sound. So i got scared and decided that if i don't want to die young i should seriously think about myself and my health. SO TODAY HERE I AM! FIRST DAY OF A NON-SMOKER LIFE!

Experiences with Chantix

Hello /r/stopsmoking, 

I began Chantix in August, but only stuck with it for about 6 weeks due to dreaming/thoughts/etc. In February, determined to quit again, I got another prescription for it. This time around the side effects have been much more manageable. I'm finshing my 2nd 28day cycle, and will be starting the third and final.

That said I'm curious if anyone has experience going from medication to unmedicated successfully? Any tips? How did it feel? I'm very concerned about myself and finding an alternative quit method to maintain success.

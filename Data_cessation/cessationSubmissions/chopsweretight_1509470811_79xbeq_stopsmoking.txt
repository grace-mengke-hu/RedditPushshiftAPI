Quit tobacco today wondering how much damage I did

Hey all, I've been smoking weed everyday for about 3 years now but have no intention of stopping that. About a year ago, I was introduced to mixing weed and tobacco in a bong (moles, chops, mooks, poppers, etc.). I thought taking a chop was no worse than smoking a cigarette but I found out today truly how unhealthy they are and how you can get COPD when you're like 25. Over the past year, I've taken about 5-15 chops everyday. Today, I've decided I want to stop taking chops but was wondering how much damage I already did to my lungs and if its probably already too late.

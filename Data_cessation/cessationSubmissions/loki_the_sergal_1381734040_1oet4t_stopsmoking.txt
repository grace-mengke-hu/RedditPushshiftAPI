Well tomorrow starts my first day of actually quiting smoking

Alrightly, short info about me. I just turned 22, started smoking when i was 19 in the army. I used to be a 3 pack a day smoker, managed to drop to a pack and a half and have been stuck there for a while. I havve tried the patch, varies brands and strengths of e sigs but as of yet been able to quit. I think its so hard for me because im constantly around it, at the shipyard or with my family and roommate. But i have decided to kick the habbit come hell or high water, i want to actually be able to breath and taste food again. 

Any tips that would make quitting cold turkey easier would be really helpful.

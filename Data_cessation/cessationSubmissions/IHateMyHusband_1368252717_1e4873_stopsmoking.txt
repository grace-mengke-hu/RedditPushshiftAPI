Former smoker wife of smoker husband. Advice?

Today marks my 2 year anniversary of being smoke free. Yay, me!

However, I am hoping for some advice on how to deal with my husbands continued smoking.

Backstory, I quit 2 years ago, the day I found out I was pregnant. My husband (then boyfriend) swore he would quit too, to support me, for our child, to save money, and for his own health.

Fast forward to today and he still smokes. For a while he at least had the decency to keep it away from me, so as not to provoke my wrath. But at this point, he just doesn't give a shit. 

He goes out to smoke, comes in reeking, and has covered our sidewalks with butts, which he refuses to pick up. Each and every day I am confronted with urges based on the knowledge, smell and sight of his habit.

I really don't know what to do. I have told him that his smoking is making it so much harder for me. His response is that if I want to smoke so bad, then I should. (Thanks, honey.) I feel like its sabotaging my long term success, because I just can't escape cigarettes being a part of my daily life.

There have been so many times I was thisclose to relapsing. He's now told me that he will never quit. I am now trying to decide if and how I can maintain my own commitment to being smokefree, while living with someone who is so addicted.

What gift could I get my grandma to encourage her to stop smoking?

My grandma turned 70 this year and she thinks it's too late to stop. She briefly tried some sort of spray that my uncle stopped with but it didn't work for her. 

I was thinking of an e-cig but I know there's been a lot of issues with them and I haven't had a chance to look into it all.

So I'm just hoping someone here might be able to recommend something.

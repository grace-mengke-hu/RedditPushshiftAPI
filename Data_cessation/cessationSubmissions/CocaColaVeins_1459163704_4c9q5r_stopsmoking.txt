I need some help.

I'm currently 19 and have been smoking socially for a couple of years. By socially i mean at parties usually when im drunk or with a whole bunch of friends. Fast forward to now and im currently smoking around half a pack a day for the last few weeks. I can already feel the addiction creeping in and want to kick it before it starts to get bad. Any advice would be HUGELY appreciated.

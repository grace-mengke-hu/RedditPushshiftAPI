How I quit smoking

I quit smoking in 2012, haven't had a cig since. Figured I'd just tell you how I quit for reference and record purposes. The best way to quit smoking is to quit while you're emotional. I quit after a fight with my ex girlfriend. Also, quit on a Monday, it's psychological and helps. 

I smoked for only about 8 years. But when I quit I was super irritable and pissed off constantly for about a year straight. The cravings didn't stop for about a year straight as well. 

I quit cold turkey. Before vaping was even a thing. 

All you have to do is stop and never look back. Quitting cigarettes was probably the most difficult thing I've ever done. Once you quit you feel great though, it's a nice sense of accomplishment. 

But those cravings will stay around for literally a year, if you can beat the cravings for a year, you will be free forever from cigarettes.

cold turkey is the best way to quit.

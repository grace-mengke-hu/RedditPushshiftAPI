91 was not an arbitrary number. Not to me anyway.

So when I started this three months ago the longest I had gone without nicotine in 25 years had been my 13 weeks in boot camp. The day I graduated I started smoking again. So now here I am on day 92 and I am really kind of proud of myself. To celebrate, last night my wife and I got take out from a place we like and sat overlooking the beach. We drank a really good bottle of wine out of plastic cups and I liked every bit of it more than I liked smoking. It was awesome, is awesome and is only going to get better. This place and all of you really helped me get here. So pick your milestones (even if they seem arbitrary) and keep after them. You got this.

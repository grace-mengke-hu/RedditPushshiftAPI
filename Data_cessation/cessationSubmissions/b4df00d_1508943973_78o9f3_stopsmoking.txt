Quitter's flu

My sinuses and lungs decided to go on strike a week after quitting. I'm going through four packs of tissues a day and hacking up a lot of mucus. But hey - the cough is actually less painful than it used to be when I was smoking! More, once I clean my nose, for a few minutes the air I breathe in seems sooo clear! Can't wait for it to be over and to be able to feel this beautiful air constantly.

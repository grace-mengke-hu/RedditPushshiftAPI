Few days in. :) Big help from weekend hiking, evening Bikram yoga, and morning CrossFit.

That is pretty much all I have to say! I'm a few days in and feeling great! I'm giving up the booze while I kick the smokes, too. EDIT: /r/stopdrinking is a good resource, if booze is a trigger and you need to give it a break.

Big congratulations to everyone here for even visiting this sub. If you're thinking about quitting, lets do it. If you already did, you rock.

Happy Tuesday.

About to get my 3rd star after 10 years of 20 a day.

It's weird. I don't come to this sub often anymore.  used to come here ten times a day. I am around smokers all the time. I don't even notice it any more. Can you remember how many people around you had a drink of water today? Being around cigs used to really get to me. Of course, sometimes I remember I used to smoke and I very rarely get a craving. I thought I would be so happy about arriving at this moment. Smoking is something I have almost all but forgotten. 

I'm sure there are going to be tough days ahead and I must make sure that I never truly forget that I am an a addict or I will almost certainly be smoking again. 

Life is the same, but I am healthier, more productive and happier.

The struggle is real......VERY REAL.

I am now a month into trying to quit smoking.  I'll wake up in the  morning and feel like 'this is it, I've got it beat and I won't give in  and light one up'.  That usually lasts about 2 hours and then I'm a  trainwreck of irritation and uncertainty.  About an hour later I'm  outside hating myself and smoking my life away.  I don't want to use  alternatives to cigarettes like patches or pills, I have tried E-Cigs  and that's no better.  I just want to be done with it.  Anybody got any  inspirational stories or words that would help?

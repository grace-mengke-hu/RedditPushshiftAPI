30 days gone...

Cravings are less to zero, sleep anxiety is here to stay (I really have trouble to sleep from week 2 till now..). The best thing is my conclusion on how big of an stupid LOSER I was for smoking 17 years!!! I AM REALLY TRYING TO FIND A REASON WHY I SHOULD SMOKE AGAIN... reasons found = NONE. thank you!

3.5 weeks and withdrawal seems to get worse and worse :-/

dear fellow addicts,

**let me introduce myself real quick, this is my first post:**

i'm male, 36, from germany, i've probably had my first smoke at 14 but stayed an on/off casual smoker for a long time. i finally started smoking a few cigs every day around age 23 and i've been a real addict and chain smoker for the last 7 to 8 years, smoking 1.5 packs a day. i work in IT, i used to smoke like a chimney during those late night coding sessions.

**reason to quit:**

i've wanted to quit for years, but finally found the last bit of motivation because i am going to be a father very soon. i've been far beyond the point of "enjoying" smoking for years though, i've hated it for years but i'm just addicted as fuck.

**the journey so far:**

i stopped ~3.5 weeks ago by simply no longer lighting a cig that tuesday morning. no reduced amount of smokes, no e-cigs, no chewing gum, nothing.

i want to be 8 weeks clean when my baby boy will probably be born, that's how i picked the date for stopping.

the first days were dominated by mood swings, feeling stressed and almost "accidentally" buying a pack during lunch break, on the way home and so on.

after a few days the first physical symptoms started. restless legs in bed, stomach problems and a general feeling of low blood pressure of feeling under the weather.

in the middle of week 3 my sleep got really affected and it is still going on.

**my current problem:**

a few times during the day, sleepiness suddenly hits me like a hammer. it's almost like a knockout. i cannot concentrate anymore, and if i am at home and lay on the couch i will fall asleep for an hour or two. it's really spooky and i've never had these sudden attacks of sleepiness ever. some days, people tell me i look sick, my skin is white and i just feel like shit. a little man in my head then tells me "just one smoke, get your blood pressure up, kill the sleepiness (like chain smoking did when i had to finish a project late at night)".

i feel like it's getting worse and worse instead of getting better over time.

**did any of you experience similar problems? i am at a point where  i sometimes feel that the withdrawal symptoms will never go away and that a slow transition instead of from 100 to zero would be better. even though i know it's bullshit.**

best,
biegeli

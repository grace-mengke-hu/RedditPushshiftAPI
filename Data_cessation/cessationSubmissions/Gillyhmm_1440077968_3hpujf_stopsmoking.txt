Advice to avoid 4th relapse

I'm been able to go an average of 1 week, and am on my 4th attempt to stay quit. When I slip with that 1 cigarette, I feel just awful physically and regretful, which should be enough for me to stop reliving thsee lapses. I know it's up to my own mental fortolitide and commitment to be successful but is there anyone with a similar experience who can lend any advice on how to get over that week threshold? Thanks all!

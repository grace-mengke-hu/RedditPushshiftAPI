Dreams, cold weather, and postnasal drip

I woke up intermittently last night. I don't remember the content of my dreams, but I do remember smoking in them. I also remember feeling quite elated and relieved when I woke up this morning and remembered that I have not smoked in over 7 months.

However, it's been unseasonably cold here in Houston, hitting a low of 32 yesterday morning when I took the dog out. Okay, okay I know, I'm spoiled that 32 is unseasonable. 

But still, it was a shock to my system and I may have caught a cold because now I have a postnasal drip.

It's interesting though. before I quit smoking, I had this post nasal drip, or smoker's cough, probably every day of my life for a decade. Yet now I hadn't had it in 6 or so months before getting sick.

Man it is a nice change for sure. And especially not going back into that cold a couple times an hour to hurt myself even more. Coming back inside, cuddling with my dog, not worried the scent is going to hurt his nose. Going out with friends later, going to meet a girl they know, not saying it's gonna be something but I won't be stinking of cigarettes anyway. Life's good :)

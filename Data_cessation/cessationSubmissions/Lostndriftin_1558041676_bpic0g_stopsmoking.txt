Anxiety and driving has always been my biggest barrier to quitting, but I had a great moment of success this morning of coping skills ACTUALLY helping me cope

I have failed at quitting so many times so this time I was determined to follow all of the recommendations (no matter how “unnecessary” for my very special self lol). So I made a list of triggers and put real thought into possible alternative behaviors. 
For driving, I came up with cold water, candy, breathing-all things I’ve tried before. I also added two new things: a carefully cultivated playlist of sing-a-long, feel-good songs and my nicotine-free vape. 
This morning (day 8) I found myself using my vape only as a microphone for the entire drive to work. As it turns out, it is so much easier to rock out when you’re not trying to smoke too, and I was in a much better mood when I got to work. 
Now I feel great and I am cautiously hopeful that I am really doing this. 
Just thought I’d share.
Thanks!

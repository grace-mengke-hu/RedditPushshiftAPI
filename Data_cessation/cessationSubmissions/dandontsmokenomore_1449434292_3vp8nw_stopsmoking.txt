Always the quitter, never the non-smoker

Hi all, 
this is my first post, but I've been lurking like a serial killer for weeks. Am on quit-attempt #56,000. That's probably not a massive exaggeration - I had a friend from school visit a few weeks ago, and when I told them (whilst lighting a cigarette) that I was trying to quit, they laughed, looked embarrassed, and pointed out I've been saying that since school. School was 12 years ago. 

So anyway, I'm now on day 9. But before anybody cheers, I've been here before. I've been to day 28 before. But, in 14 years of smoking, I've never been any further. And man oh man, have I been a heavy smoker in that time. I am pretty certain that, if I went missing, and had to be described to a friendly police officer, any known friend, relative or acquaintance would start with, 'well, she's got a cigarette lit...'.

Day 9 though, it's a start. I have the quit smoking app. I have a supportive boyfriend. I have an EXTREMELY sore tongue - anyone else got that? - and I have some kind of mad, foolish hope. The kind that got pioneers eaten by bears.

Wish me luck y'all.

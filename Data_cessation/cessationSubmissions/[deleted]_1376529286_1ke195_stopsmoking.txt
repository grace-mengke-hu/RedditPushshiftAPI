Day three without smoking. I'm losing my mind.

So I have been a smoker for just about six years now. I just got a job at a hospital so it requires passing a nicotine test. I've tried to quit a bunch times before but having this job on the line is finally given me some kind of tangible incentive. 

Question one:
As I said its been three days, my test is in five days from now. I read all kinds info online saying it could take two days up to 3 or 4 months. So any people with first hand experience that could help lower my anxiety about this? and any tips to help purge my system?

Question Two:
As stated in the title I'm starting to go crazy. I got gum and sunflower seeds, but honestly nothing is helping. I've been having cravings all day. Mainly a lot of fidgeting and irritability. Somewhere before I heard something about certain foods that can help curve cravings? Can anyone shed some light on that? and any other tricks you used to help you in these early days of quitting?


~~Also how do i get one of those badges?~~
Nevermind, just read the side bar. 

THANKS

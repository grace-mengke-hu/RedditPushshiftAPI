Almost to the goal of 31 days smokefree!

So I'm 21days smoke free..
I've been a smoker for 6 years and a heavy one for 4 out of those 6 (2 packs on a bad day) 
Pretty much I never thought I would get to this point as I have never gotten past the 1 week mark. Where I live a pack is about $20 dollars with price increases every 6 months. Already save around $400(shit)
Even though I'm on NRT I still feel heaps better, ran 3km for the first time without stopping!

I want to say is thank you to you all whenever I have a craving I come on this sub reddit and just read everyone's posts and it's really great encouragement! 

Have a good one and keep strong!

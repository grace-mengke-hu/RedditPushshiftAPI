Looking for Non-smoking, Romantic Partners of Smokers for a Research Study

Hi everyone,

I am a high-school student taking an AP Research class and I am conducting a research study on non-smoking, romantic partners of smokers and their experience with perceived responsiveness from their smoking partner. If anyone here has a supportive partner that might be interested in participating or better yet, are a supportive partner that is interested, you can contact me in my email [PChenBGHS@gmail.com](mailto:PChenBGHS@gmail.com). Any participants would be greatly appreciated!

Thank you.

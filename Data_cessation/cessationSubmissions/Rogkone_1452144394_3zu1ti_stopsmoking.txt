Why is it so easy?

I smoked my last cigarette on 31.12.2015, and since then i only felt like i could smoke one right now like 3 times. No thinking that it would be necessary or something. I smoked for almost 4 year, usually a pack for 2 days, on weekends sometimes 2 packs one day.  
Will it get harder? I'm still on holiday, and had a little cold the last few days, maybe that's why.

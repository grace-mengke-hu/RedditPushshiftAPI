How I managed to go a year without

when I made the commitment to stop my tobbaco habit, I forced myself to think of nothing but yodeling for thirty minutes every time the urge struck me. Pretty sure that this works by making the urge a negitive experence. I'm glad to say I've made it a whole year with this stratagy.

The Truth

I loved smoking. I enjoyed the smell of tobacco in my mouth, the feeling of exhaling smoke, the smoke breaks, drinking and smoking aaaah that felt so good, the coolness!
But now I see that were all lies. Addiction. 

Because I didn't know how bad I smelled. Or that I didn't look cool at all. 

Now when I see people on the street sucking on a cigarette, they just look so pathetic. Look at them, desperately sucking on a piece of something. They HAVE to do it.

And don't get me wrong, I still sometimes pass beside them and inhale a bit of the cigarette smoke... just to remind myself. It doesn't feel bad either. But I can see now. All lies.

And I wish I could smoke only at concerts and very special occasions. But I can't. That's why I'm here.

The truth - I can never smoke another cigarette in my life.

Nail Growth?

I’ll be 6 weeks smoke free this Thursday after smoking daily for 3 years. I picked up smoking due to a stressful job and school. Everything has been going good since I’ve been smoke free. One thing I noticed though is that my nails have been growing long and stronger. I cut my nails for the first time in years (literally) last week. They never grew. Has anyone else experienced this and would it be due to increased blood flow? Thanks

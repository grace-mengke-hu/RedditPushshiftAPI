I started an argument with a family member just to get a reason to smoke.

Only lasted for 4 Days. It seemed to be like one big craving, for almost 96 hours straight with nightmares, waking up at night, sweating and tachycardia. Also, it felt like my brain would explode any minute. 

Do the cravings get shorter? If not, I'm really considering to pick it up again and just kill myself if I'm diagnosed with cancer or whatever.

Back to square one, I guess.

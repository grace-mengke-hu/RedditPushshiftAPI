Time has slowed right down, but I’m 60 hours free!

Thanks to this sub, Allen Carr’s book (and audiobook) and the Smoke Free and Quit Genius apps, I’ve managed to make it to the 60 hour mark of being completely smoke free after heavily smoking for 15 years. Just thought I’d say thanks to everyone on here as reading this sub in the weeks leading up to my date really helped.

One thing though, man TIME has SLOWED down. It’s so weird and I’m guessing due to the brain changes occurring but minutes feel like hours and days like weeks. I’m not really suffering with it, in fact I’m enjoying the detoxification process a lot - it’s just an observation.

But did anyone else notice this time distortion? And how long did it last?

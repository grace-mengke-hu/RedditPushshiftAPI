Im quitting for good. Cold turkey. I'll do it for me this time

Im tired of smoking. Too many time did i quit to start again after a few days, weeks or months. I need to become better, and stoping smoking goes with it. I realy stop this time. I realy need to become a person i can respect myself with my mind and health.

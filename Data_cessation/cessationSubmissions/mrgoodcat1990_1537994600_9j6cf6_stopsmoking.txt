Everytime i have a smoke i crave food ,everytime i eat i crave nicotine ???

Im no neuroscientiat but from my basic understanding Food and nicotine activate the same neural pathways , dopamine and serotonin elevates .

Everytime I activate this circuit it lights up a need for whatever else is currently binded to it ie addiction 

Does anyone get theae cravings , I mean when I smoke , instantly I think about sugar , when I eat instantly about nicotine and the cycle can become insane .

One of the reasons I need to quit smoking is it seems to heighten every other addictive craving

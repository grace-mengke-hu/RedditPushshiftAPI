Hi quitters! How can I, as a non smoker, help my boyfriend quit without being obnoxious?

I had been a social smoker for years (I never got addicted, thank goodness) and recently stopped smoking on the weekends to support my boyfriend who was smoking almost a pack a day. I'm really proud of him because he's gotten down to one a day during the week (or more. He likes to hide it from me), but on the weekends he feels he deserves to smoke as many as he pleases. It drives me nuts! I don't know the pains of quitting, so I can't relate, but he bums up to 5 cigarettes from his buddies in one weekend night! 

I understand it's really hard to stop when you are drinking, and when he's not around smokers he doesn't ever complain. I just feel like he is so close, and for some reason he doesn't want to completely kick the habit. I know I annoy him on weekends, but it is just so disappointing to see him smoke when he claims he is "quitting". 

So, what do I do? I want him to quit so badly, for his health because I love him, but should I just shut up and let him continue to be a half ass quitter? Can anyone relate and give me some advice?

Had a lil slipup today

Its been 7 months without smoking and today it would've been 8 days without nicotine (vape) but I messed up. I just was missing that feeling. I want to stop having to relying on nicotine to make me feel better, but it's hard. 
Anyway, I don't really know where to go from here, I still wanna quit but I dont wanna go through all those withdrawal symptoms I dealt with the first week without. 

Tl;dr: used nicotine again, still wanna quit but I don't wanna go through the first weeks symptoms again.

Day 3 when will the hatered for mankind stop?

So been clean for 3 days and i still want to do and say horrible things to people, and sadly cant fgth the urge ,  or better yet be left alone for the time being.

When will this end, fuck cravings those are not the issue but i just want to be one of those ''puts the damzel on the traintracks and twirls his moustache'' or an irl 13 year old CoD kid yelling obsenities at people , kind of person.

2 days in. Bored as shit

First time posting. Im hoping I find someone who can relate. 

Never really took the time to see that smoking was actually a way to deal with boredom until now. I’ve been a smoker for about wow..10 years and chain smoker for about the last 3 years. Now that I’m trying to quit I’ve noticed that I have no interest in doing the same things that I would usually do because I can’t have a smoke.

Like I’m a serious fuckin procrastinator it kind of worrisome. Anyways, what I’m trying to say is how can I fill this void (i guess for lack of a better word) with something better when I’m too lethargic to do anything?! If I’m being honest its frustrating as f###.

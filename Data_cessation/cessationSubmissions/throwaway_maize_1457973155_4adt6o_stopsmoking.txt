Has anyone here quit cigarettes AND e-cigarettes?

I quit smoking yesterday after a year of roughly half a pack per day. I only started last April, though I've been using e-cigarettes heavily for ~3 years. 

I've been trying to decide whether or not it's time to give up vaping as well. That's actually more difficult, as vaping was mostly for my oral fixation while working/driving. I believe there's more health concerns about ecigs than we currently know because they're so new. I know the whole popcorn lung deal - but I was a hardcore user - building my own coils and mixing my own juice. So it's not purity that's a concern, but more so the effects of nicotine in general. 

With that said, has anyone here quit vaping with noticeable improvements? Looking for some motivation - it's easier for me to quit cigs because of the overwhelming evidence against them.

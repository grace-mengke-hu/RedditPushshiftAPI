I need motivation

So I left for a family trip and left all my nicotine at home. It’s been 4 days and really it hasn’t been too bad. I am headed back home soon and I know my Sourin is sitting in my car with a fresh pod. I’ve been talking about quitting forever, and feel like I can really do it this time. But I have been thinking and just know that when I get back, I will try to only take a hit or two and end up right back where I was. Any advice? Should I just throw the vape away?

It's time to make a change.

I am smoking my last 3 cigarettes (smoked for 3 years) before quitting for good tonight. My doctor informed me that my lungs are developing more mucous than normal and if i do not quit now I am at serious risk for developing copd. I can't live life on a respirator so here is to a life where I am able to breathe. I don't know why I'm posting on here but I feel good about this time because I know that if I don't I am going to die. I am going to make my badge after a week as it will be my reward for not going back. 

Edit: I want that badge.

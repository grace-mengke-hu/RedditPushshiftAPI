Started on the gum today (no cigarettes), and I've got a few questions...

I'm curious as to the negative effects of the nicotine gum, namely-  
How does the nicotine in the gum affect heart rate, circulation, and so on? What should I adjust along those lines when looking at one of the 'quit smoking' type apps that track these things? I've done a bit of googling, but to be honest my fucking attention span is in the shitter right now. 
Thanks for all and any answers.

EDIT: Also, being as my phone is too dim to run apps of any kind (it's a flipper), any suggestions on good free apps for Mac?

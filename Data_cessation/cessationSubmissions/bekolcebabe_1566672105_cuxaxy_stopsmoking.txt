Today was the hardest day, still didnâ€™t smoke, but feel like crying my eyes out ðŸ˜ª

So stressed, have a dream holiday booked for a few weeks away, &amp; today the airline cancelled our flights, canâ€™t get through to them to sort anything out. Had a riding lesson, horse must have felt my bad vibes so lesson went really badly-feels like weâ€™re going backwards. Shitting myself that the follow up chest X-ray ray I have to do soon will show a lung cancer-I quit 21 days ago as I got pneumonia but they werenâ€™t totally happy there wasnâ€™t something nasty underlying . Told hubby I really wanted to smoke ( he still does)&amp; he said have one if you really want ðŸ˜¬ but I figured would it really make me feel better??-decided I would feel worse/guilty/weak &amp; managed not to light up. Should feel really chuffed but just want to cry ðŸ˜¢

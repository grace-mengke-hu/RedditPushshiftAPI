Should I do a yearly check-up?

I quit smoking at 27 after about 9 years of heavy smoking, a pack per day on average. Should I do a yearly check-up to see if I'm getting cancer or will I probably be fine? They say quitting smoking before 30 decreases the risk to that of a non-smoker, but I'm scared asf haha.

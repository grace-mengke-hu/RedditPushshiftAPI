Quit nicotine, still smoke joints: some observations

Few days over 300 and I can honestly say this feels easy now. I don't want to let my guard down but some of the shit I've come through in the last 9 months... Sheesh. 


Anyway, smokin' doobs with chamomile tea:


* tear open that teabag 
* sprinkle in about a third of the quantity of tobacco you'd use
* bung in a tad more ganja than you would normally
* put a filter in the end (not to be missed)
* #420blazeit

Taste is relatively smooth and goes nicely with green. 

This works for me because I'm dropping nicotine and big tobacco companies controlling my life - it's my health I'll ruin it if I want but not because of an addiction and not while some fatcat moral sinkhole needlessly profits. 

So yeah, chamomile. Clipper Tea's 'Snore' labeled tea is pretty good, but then again is mainly chamomile. Other suggestions gladly received.

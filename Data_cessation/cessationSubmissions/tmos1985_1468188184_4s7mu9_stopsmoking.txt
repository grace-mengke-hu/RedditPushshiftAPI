The most insane and realistic nightmares...

I have been trying to quit a lot over the last few months. I have failed a couple of times. Both times when I have started smoking again I have had the most scary and realistic nightmares the same night. Has anyone else experienced this? I'm guessing it has something to do with nicotine or some chemicals in the cigarettes.....

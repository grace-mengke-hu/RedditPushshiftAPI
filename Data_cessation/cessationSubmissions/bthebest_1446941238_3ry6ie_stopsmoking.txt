I'm Checking in. 120 days.

Well brothers and sisters, today will be the 120th day I haven't had a cig. I thought I owed it to everyone to check in and give my progress. Lurking these threads certainly got me on the right track, and to some degree have kept me there. Maybe someone will be inspired by my unpolished prose.
Details:
4 months ago I stopped smoking cold turkey from approx 1 pack a day. I also took on other addictions, which I believe are even more unhealthy due to the novelty of high-speed internet in human history (for other young men, check out r/nofap). My blood pressure has normalized, and I have to say that my general outlook on life is better. ---stay strong.

Using money as an incentive.

Well, I've been telling myself I would quit for months, I find it hard to care about the health benefits but I've been especially motivated recently because I'm trying to save money for a trip next summer. 

The crazy idea that I've had is to require myself to match the price of every pack I buy into my savings jar, in my opinion, this is the perfect solution because it's negative enforcement in the short term and it will help me to save (and quit) in the long term. Depending on how it goes I may also have some sort of price for each cigarette I smoke, say 50p to the jar, but I'll see how it goes.

Has anyone else tried anything like this, and how did it go?

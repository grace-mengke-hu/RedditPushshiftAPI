Think about yourself as an old person talking to yourself now.

I read somewhere on this site that good advice is to think of yourself when you get old talking to the current you about things he/she should have done at your age. You’re supposed to then take action.          
                 
I  imagined Old Man Banjo saying, “I wish I had quit smoking when I was your age.” I didn’t take action, and the thought would randomly come to me and make me uncomfortable.               
                 
Today, Old Man Banjo randomly made an appearance to say, “I’m so glad I quit smoking at your age.”                
                          
Feels good.

Didn't smoke while drunk :D

So I had a bit of a blow out this weekend as it is the last chance I'll get before my exams. Two days of heavy drinking and fast food but I didn't smoke! I really feel like I'm going to stay off them this time :)
Thank you for all of the kind words guys :D Onwards and upwards.

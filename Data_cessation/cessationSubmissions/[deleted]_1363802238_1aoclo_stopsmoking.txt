Oh well.

I've tried the quitting thing. The thing is that I love the way cigarettes taste and make me feel. My hating the cost is the only real motivation I have to stop. It's nice having the fall back though. I went from a pack and a half a day after 8 years of smoking at the end of last year and now I'm down to 1 to 3 cigarettes a week, which I'm totally fine with.

Based on the general consensus in this subreddit, I won't last. But I'm the only one who can actually find that out and I genuinely believe that I can last this way.

Best of luck to y'all :)

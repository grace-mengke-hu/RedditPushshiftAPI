At my mom’s 50th

I’m at my mothers 50th birthday at my dads shop. There will be people smoking inside at the back of the shop because it’s below 0 degrees here. Not as bad as Wednesday’s projected 60• below zero but still cold! 
Anyway, I’m on my 4th? Day smoke free or something like that and it’s going to be hard but I can’t not be here. Someone is packing a pack next to me as I type. 
I have my SRTs but I still have to wait awhile before I can even have another. 
This night will be tough. Currently 6pm and things are just getting started. 
Give me strength reddit!

The Power of Three (For Me At Least)

I'm not an expert and haven't gotten very far on this quit (yet), but I do have three things that have helped me get where I am and thought I'd share. They are Motivations, Distractions, and Creating Healthy Habits.


**1) Motivations** 

For me, this is as much about writing down the things I want as it is writing down the things I do not want. Here are a few of mineâ€¦

* I want good health and I do *not* want to poison/kill myself. 
* I do want to breathe easier and I do *not* want to get emphysema/COPD. 
* I do want to smell nice to others and I do *not* want to smell like an ashtray. 
* I do want to have whiter teeth and I do *not* want gum disease. 
* I do want to live my life to the fullest and I do *not* want to be chained to a cigarette. 
* I do want to be a good example to others I love and I do *not* want to be a cautionary tale. 
* I do want to be the best that I can be and I do *not* want to be the least that I can be. 
* I do want my coworkers to respect me and I do *not* want smoking to hinder my career opportunities.  
* I do want to find someone special and I do *not* want them to reject me because I smoke. 
* I do want more energy and I do *not* want to feel like shit all the time.

The list goes on but I think it is important to write it down somewhere and keep reviewing those things. These are goals you can achieve and negative outcomes you can avoid. Both can be powerful motivators! 

**2) Distractions** 

Cravings and negative thoughts are going to happen. For me distractions are a good method of overcoming them. Here are some of my distractions...

* I go on Reddit/Internet.
* I read a book.
* I exercise. 
* I sleep and take naps whenever possible.
* I meditate.
* I learn something new.
* I create something new.
* I learn how to cook something new.
* I do the laundry and clean the house/car.
* I masturbate (if I hadn't recently broken up, it would be lots of sex instead).
* I watch television.
* I make hot tea or coffee. 
* I call someone.
* I go to a movie.  

While it is impossible to always be distracted, just sitting around and thinking about how miserable I am is not something I enjoy or something that would be beneficial to my quitting. I'm not avoiding the cravings and negative thoughts as much as I am not allowing them to completely take over my existence. 

**3) Creating Healthy Habits**

I feel it is important to add worth to ourselves while we quit smoking. If we value ourselves and feel good about ourselves then we are likely to treat ourselves better. Some of these things also work as great distractions too.

* I try to compliment someone everyday and help others when possible. It feels good to make others feel good! Plus I have to make up for being an asshole sometimes!
* I exercise everyday. I do very intense workouts and run a few miles each day. This reduces stress, sweats out those toxins, and builds a better body. 
* I learn one thing new everyday. Gotta work that brain out too!
* I create something new everyday. Sometimes it is just a doodle, but I created it damn it and it feels good! 
* I meditate and/or do yoga. Finding peace within is very powerful. I kinda suck at this, but I'm getting better.
* I eat a good diet. I'm doing a modified Paleo diet currently - it allows me to eat much more than some other diets and with the exercise I am actually losing weight on this. Win/win baby!

Any OTC for degraded molar teeths/cavities?

Not sure if this is the appropriate subreddit. But I came home from school (5 hr drive, 4 months apart), and he has swollen gums that seem to overlap huge cavities in his molar teeth. Are there any OTC medications? It's possible bacterial infection or whatever is killing it. I really don't know :c 

Or direct me to correct subreddit please! Surgery is the last thing we want to do because of financial reasonings.

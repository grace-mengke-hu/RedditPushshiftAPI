Quitting, but not when drinking.

Hi guys!

**TL;DR: is it possible to go directly back to consuming tobacco only when drinking?**  

I've been doing [snus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snus) now for several years, but pretty much exclusively when drinking. The last 10 months or so however, I've been doing around 3 \- 5 of them per day, even when sober. I've now decided to quit, but I've decided with myself that I really do enjoy it when I am drinking, so my goal is to go back to doing it only in combination with alcohol, like I did for several years. My question is however: **will I have trouble when not quitting fully?** 

The reason I'm wondering about this is because I did quit cold turkey last week and it went fine, with the exception of some minor withdrawals \(no cravings, just a bit more negative thoughts than usual and perhaps some brain\-fog\). Friday came around and I had some beers and decided to treat myself to a couple of snus, since this was my plan anyways. Saturdays I usually drink, so I therefore continued snusing that day like normal when drinking. Sunday I went back to no snus or alcohol, and have been keeping it up since. However, yesterday I felt the same small withdrawals as I did the previous Monday \(the part that bothers me is the slight depression/more negative thoughts than usual\). This made me think that this might keep happening until I quit for good. I don't want to trap myself in a circle where I have slight withdrawals during the week, only to 'reset' during the weekends. 

So I guess my question is this: will I have progress if I don't do it at all during weekdays but consume tobacco during the weekends, or is it pretty much pointless and I should just quit all together? Is it possible to go back to the drinking\-only habit, or did I sort of ruin this scheme when I started doing it while sober? I don't really enjoy it too much when sober, but when I drink I love them. Plus, if I drink and don't have snus then I really start to crave them, and it feels like a part of the night is ruined if I don't. 

Thanks in advance guys!

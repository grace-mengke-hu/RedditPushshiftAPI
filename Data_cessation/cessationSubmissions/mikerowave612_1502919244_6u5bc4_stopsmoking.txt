Running After Quitting

I quit smoking 30 days ago with no nicotine replacement. It has been going great so far. The only weird thing is that I have some chest tightness and I have noticed that my lungs feel more "stressed"during my runs than they did before I quit. Is this normal? Is this just my lungs healing or should I be concerned? 
Thanks, this community has really helped me so far.

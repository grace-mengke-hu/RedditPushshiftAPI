Over a month in and I am starting to forget!

So I have quit for over a month now and I actually feel pretty great. I have gone through a number of quitters colds so my lungs are clearing out very nicely, and I can already notice a difference in my skin looking healthier and pinker.
  
One of the more surprising things for me though is that now I am forgetting I used to smoke, and forgetting that I am a quitter. I rarely get cravings anymore. When I do, they pass so fast that I forget they even happened. I never think about how it would be nice to step outside for one, never worry about how I smell, or when I will need to go buy another pack. I have even forgot to check in here for the past couple days.
  
For everyone just starting: just stick to it, because it is so much better when you make it through the first couple weeks.

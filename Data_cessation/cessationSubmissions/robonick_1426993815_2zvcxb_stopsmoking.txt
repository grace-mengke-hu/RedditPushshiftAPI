Need encouragement.

The last 10 days have been bearable, between Chantix, toothpicks and not hanging out with my smoker friends, but I'm in Las Vegas this week for business and EVERYTHING smells like smoke and EVERYONE is smoking. PLUS, I went to the gift shop to buy a bottle of water, I look up and I see they've got my cloves that I used to love so much. I convinced myself to not even ask the lady how much they cost and got up to my room without caving, but I am scared as hell I'll convince myself at some point during the week that, "It's ok if it's just one, you're in Vegas, you should take advantage of smoking inside again, etc. etc. bullshit etc."

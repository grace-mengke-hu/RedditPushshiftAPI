"I've been hanging on to these for you"

I was in California with a coworker back in early November, but because of my travel schedule and the holidays I haven't seen him since then.  Today he walked up to my desk, and handed me a pack of cigarettes.  He said "you gave me these when we were out drinking, and I've been holding onto them since then.  Here you go". 

They sat on my desk for the next several hours.  I kept looking at the box with a kind of detached curiosity.  How would I handle this?  What would I feel?  Would I crumble given this test?

Well, I'm very happy to say that the only thing I felt while looking at that little blue box was a sense of calm, and mild contempt.  It was one of the greatest feelings to be able to throw them away without a second thought.

Thank you all for helping me quit smoking.  The changes I'm feeling are marvelous, and I really appreciate all your help.

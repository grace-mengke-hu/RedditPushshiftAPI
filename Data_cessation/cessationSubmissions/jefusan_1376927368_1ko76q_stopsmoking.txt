Next step: me and alcohol are on a short break.

Not quitting drinking forever necessarily, but I've noticed that my drinking has increased noticeably since I quit smoking, and I don't think it's helping my mood swings. I may give myself a couple weeks sober just to see how I feel.

Have any of you found yourself drinking more heavily to compensate?

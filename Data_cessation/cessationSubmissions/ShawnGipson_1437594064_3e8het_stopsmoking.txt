I would have been a year smoke free 10 days ago....but I fell back into addiction 2 months ago.

Time to reset my badge and my priorities.  Do I want a healthy life or an early death?  I am now smoke free for 3 days.  I got really stressed out a few months ago about something I can't even remember.  I went out an bout a pack.  Smoked one.  Became disgusted with myself and tossed the pack.  The next day I did the same.  And the next.  Until finally I was smoking the whole pack.  Never again.  I will not be a slave to addiction any longer.

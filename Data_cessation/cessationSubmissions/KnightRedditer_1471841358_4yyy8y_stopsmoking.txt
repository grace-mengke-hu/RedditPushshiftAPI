I Never Opened This Sub Until Today.

1 week today without a smoke.I quit once before for nearly 5 years. Started up again about 10 years ago and have wanted to quit for all 10 of those.

I've been subscribed to this sub for a few months, and never opened it, I just liked seeing it in my feed as a constant reminder that it's time.  It actually really helped! 

Sure, my mind has tried to trick me in to smoking  (you can have JUST one with a drink, or only on weekends, etc.) a few times, but after day three, I'm able to rationalize it out and know if I had one, it would taste great for a moment, then like shit, then I'd get a head rush, then I'd feel guilty. The cravings go away, the guilt, not so much. 
 
You can do this. If you mis-step, forgive yourself and try again.

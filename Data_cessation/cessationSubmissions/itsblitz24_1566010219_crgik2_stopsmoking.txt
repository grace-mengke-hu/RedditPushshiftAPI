Attempting to stop smoking again

I've been smoking for about three/four years now.

Along these three/four years, I've tried to quit smoking countless times: my longest streak was in 2018, from around july up until september, when I purchased a pack while drunk, at a college party, and relapsed.

I've managed to stay one month free in the beginning of the year, but I failed yet again and kept smoking since then.

Now, I've bought Smoke Free and I've set my quitting date to September 15. I'm feeling really determined to quit this, I feel so tired of having to hide myself to get a smoke, spending so much money away on tobacco and caving in to my vice even though I managed to be fine without it for a long time and even though I know it's effects closely.

I've been reading through some posts here, and you were really instrumental in making me decide this for once and for all. Have you got any particular advice that you want to share that you think would be very helpful to me?

Thanks in advance, and keep up your good work, everyone! And if you relapsed and are reading this, it's ok, you're not the first person that it happens to, you'll make it, at your own pace, at your own time. Lots of love to all of you.

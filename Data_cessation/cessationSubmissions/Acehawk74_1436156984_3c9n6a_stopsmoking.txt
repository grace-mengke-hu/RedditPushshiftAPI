Hello everyone. I am a quitter, and I'm damn proud of it.

Hello, my name is Eric. I wanted to introduce myself to you all, and let you know why I am joining you. The obvious is health. I have been an on/off smoker for years. I smoked a lot when I was 18, stopped for a year or two, started again. It has been on/off for a few months at a time since. I am now 34 years old. I am blessed with two children, a daughter and a son, and I am quitting because I am tired of not being able to breathe. I am quitting because I want to live, not suffocate my pain. I am quitting because damn it, I deserve better. 

I currently have a nasty bronchitis infection that has been haunting me for a month. I still wheeze daily. I am going through antibotics, steroid, and inhalers. I can't wait to feel normal again, but I can tell you... smoke free since June 25th, 2015. 

I'm never going back. My friends, family, students (Im a teacher), and myself...are my motivation.

Thank you for reading, and thank you for this community.

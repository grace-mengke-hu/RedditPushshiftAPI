I am honestly struggling

Ironically, the first 3-4 days for me were bearable. The cravings were constant but I felt happy, knowing that I am free (using Allen's words). But now, while the cravings are noticeably less frequent, they are significantly more intense and longer in duration. The worst part of it all, I am losing sight as to why I want to quit. 

Please help.

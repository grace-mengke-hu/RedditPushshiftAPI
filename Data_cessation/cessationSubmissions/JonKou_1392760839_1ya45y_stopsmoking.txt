Today, I quit. I've been smoking since I was 13 years old. And you know, it started out as just a phase. But then I realized anxiety was "treatable" with smoking. 

It did help, but not in the best of ways. I bargained my life and willpower for a few years of mildly soothed anxiety. 

But then my life changed. I changed as a person. The anxiety became manageable and near non existent. But I still smoked. 

I connected the smoking with being cool, thoughtful, laid back, romantic. But it wasn't. I wasn't unique. I wasn't cooler. I was sucking corporate cock for 9 years! I was a slave to it without any good reason but to satisfy my addiction. 

Not today. Not today, and not tomorrow, and hopefully not the next day, week, month, year, and the rest of my life. 

I want my freedom back. I want my life back before it's no longer obtainable

Looking for Support/Advice Please!

I am so close to finishing Allen Carrâ€™s book and would love to hear from those who have successfully quit with this method!! I did once in 2016 but faced some depression and anxiety and went right back after about a year. All quits since then have been failures. 

Thank you :)

I had to remove my badge today.

It's hard to say whether or not right now is a good time to quit. I'd been cheating for the last few months, going on and off.  But from what I learned is this:

-It gets the easiest after the 3 day mark.


-Drinking doesn't help

-Caffeine doesn't help

-If you're stressed, confide in someone in a comfortable setting.


I hope to soon join the ranks amongst you fine folk that are trying so hard. I love the dedication to rid your lives of dependence.

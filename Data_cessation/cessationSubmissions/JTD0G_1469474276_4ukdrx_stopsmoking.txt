Health upon quitting

Hey guys, I quit just over six months ago now and it's honestly been a breeze. I feel better, my moods are more stable and my mental health has probably been the best change but recently I've been getting morning phlegm, in fact morning to early afternoon phlegm, how long does this go on for?

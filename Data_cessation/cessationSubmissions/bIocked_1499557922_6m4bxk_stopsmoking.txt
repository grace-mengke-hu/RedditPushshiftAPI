Hit day 20 and suddenly not feeling so great

This is my first and only quit after having smoked a half pack/day for 7 years.

I didn't quit cold turkey, per se, because I have been using an e-cig with 6 mL juice for when those cravings kick in. 

So as it stands, I am feeling extremely sad/un-energetic/lonely today. As most people know, we all have bad days. But I don't feel like my crappy mood is coming from an emotional place, but a physical one. Does that make sense? It's a strange feeling. 

Did anybody experience something similar 20 days in? I find it bizarre that it only happened just now, seeing as I should have kicked my physical dependency a while ago. And if you have any advice on mitigating this sudden depressive state ( ... :( ... ) I'd love to hear it.

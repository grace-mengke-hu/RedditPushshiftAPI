Questions about physical changes after quitting

Hey all, I'm currently working through my 3rd week of not smoking and I couldn't feel better! I was wondering if/when any of you with months/years under their belts noticed any physical changes. Some specific questions:

Did your skin/nails change? 
Did the quality of your sleep improve or worsen? Did your hair quantity and texture change?
Are you able to manage your weight better or worse than before?

Thanks! And keep up the not smoking!

Day 2, feels good.. again!

I quit for a year and change, then I picked it back up on a whim a couple months ago.  I was sad about it, smoking half a pack a day like I used to.  So I said fuck it, I'm not going through this again, bought the step 2 patches and am now a non smoker.

Stay strong stop smoking. GL, hf, gg.

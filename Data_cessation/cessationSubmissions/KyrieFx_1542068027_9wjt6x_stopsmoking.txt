First attempt at quitting (Age 21)

Today, I smoked my last cigarette. I don’t know how I’ll continue you on not smoking with so many trigger times I had throughout the day.

I’ve been smoking now for about a year and a half, and I’m tired of being short of breath for sometimes no reason and the fact that if I continue I’m just potentially shortening my life span with every cancer stick I light. 

I’ll miss the light headedness after a long stressful day, or just having something to keep my company while I’m on a long drive or being home alone. 

I know this is almost the equivalent of ending a toxic relationship, but I’m relaying on this community and my own willpower to finally put the sticks down and end this disgusting habit. 

I need all the advice I can get, retaining to staying nicotine free and defeating triggers. I’m reading all comments. 

Wish me luck!

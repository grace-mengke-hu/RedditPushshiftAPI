Badge reset time

I've struggled too long and held a badge for a day that wasn't valid. It's time to quit again. I've started the patch to help this time, last time I tried cold turkey. Also, this time my mom is quitting with me. We're here to support each other. I've already said no once today with a co-worker that offered me a cigarette just in case I needed it. I've already got wicked nicotine buzz going on from the patch. I just need to kick the psychological aspect. This sub had inspired me to start quitting again. This time though, it's forever.

2 days no nicotine.

I quit a 5 year nicotine habit, i was chewing gums about 20mg in nicotine a day for the past month and on my way to work 2 days ago threw them all in the bin. is it normal not being able to sleep? Everything else like headaches and cravings i expected. But not being able to sleep seems weird as nicotine is a stimulant so i would think having none of it would make sleep easier and not harder.

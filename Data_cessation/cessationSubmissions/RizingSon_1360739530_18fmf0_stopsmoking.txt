6 Months clean after 20+ years and....relapse.

I stopped cold turkey in July 2012 on my first attempt after 20+ years. Used a little Allen Carr, Joel on YT, and a Buddhist friend. Over the past two weeks I've started smoking again. Been hanging out with girl who smokes. Being around smokers in the past was NEVER a problem. Didn't bother me. One night after a shite day of work I ended up just grabbing one of her menthol's (gross!) rationalizing it by telling myself that since they're menthol, I'll never "really" want one. But here I am...Back on the nic.
I will not continue this but I just feel....stuck.

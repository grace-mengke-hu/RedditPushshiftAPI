I'd like to raise my bat in honour of my 50th day!

I quit cold turkey after about 5 years and am now nicotine free since 50 days. 

There wasn't any *single* thing that tipped me over but a combination of factors like this subreddit(where I could read about the kind of struggles that people were going through which were similar to what I felt), our government also went on a full scale anti-tobacco campaign a couple of months ago. They had scary ads playing everywhere. I started hating going to the movies because these ads would play for a good 5 minutes in two languages and all my friends would give me the stare.

I briefly became dependent on Caffeine intensive energy drinks in the initial weeks but I don’t need those now either. Food consumption has increased considerably and I have started hitting the gym to level it out(still working on getting disciplined on that front though). Also, I have officially become the guy who always stocks chewing gum.

To be frank, when I reset the counter here, I was kinda skeptical about how long before I reset it again. 

I’d sincerely like to thank the people of this subreddit. This has kinda made me proud of myself after a long time.

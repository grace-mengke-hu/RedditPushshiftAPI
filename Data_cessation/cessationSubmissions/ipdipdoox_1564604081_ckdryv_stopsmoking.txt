Will I need to make a conscious effort everyday to be a non smoker?

It’s only been three days which is a huge achievement for me! 
I’m not really having cravings at all, it’s more the habit side of things that I miss, or the rituals of smoking.
How do you feel, do you have to remind yourself everyday?

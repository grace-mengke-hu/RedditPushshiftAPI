Day 20.. extremely anxious

So I got this invite to a nightclub today.. well music there wont be my vibe and that place is crazy crowded. Last time i was still a smoker and smoked a pack there.
I have to go because its a friends birthday but im extremely anxious...
I know im gonna be awkward there and if i don't smoke I'll be 2x more awkward.
I wish i could smoke just today.
Also I can't dance so taking smoke breaks every 5 minutes was handy.

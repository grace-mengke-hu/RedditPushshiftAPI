117 days, and I fuck it up...

So I stopped smoking when I moved to a different part of the country for school. Wasn't a problem really. Nobody up there really smoked. Then yesterday I came back home for christmass, and went out drinking with my old friends, and wouldn't you fucking know it, I go "You know what, its been over a hundred days, I've earned a fucking cigarette!"

God fucking dammit. There's no point to this, I just really need to vent. Super angry at myself for fucking this up. In just three short minutes, I managed to disappoint myself massively. Way to fucking go me.

A war in my brain

I'm on day 28 and the smoker side of my brain is battling the non-smoker side and I'm not sure who will win. I keep trying to convince myself that I want to start smoking again. I've relapsed several times, once on my birthday I had 3 cigs and then another time had 1 cog my friend offered me.

I feel like there is war going on and I have no control of the outcome. I've been feeling depressed lately and have wanted to smoke again to ease my mental angst. 

I don't even know if I can get past this day and I'm afraid I've failed :(

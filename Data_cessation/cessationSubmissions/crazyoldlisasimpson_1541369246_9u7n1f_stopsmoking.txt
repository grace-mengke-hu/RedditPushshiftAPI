Day 3 - when do you stop thinking about smoking?

I’m on day 3 cold turkey. Doing well so far, I thought it would be much much worse. I smoked 10 years, around 30 a day. I live in Australia, where a pack of my preferred is now $50 for a pack of 40. So, I was spending between $250 to someone’s over $300 a week on smokes. 

I get cravings, sometimes they’re really tough (mornings, after an evening meal). But even when I’m not having a craving and don’t have any desire to smoke I think about smoking. 

I feel like smoking is on my mind in one way or another all day, it’s getting really irritating. I don’t want to smoke, but am I going to have to spend the rest of my life thinking about how I’m not smoking?? 

Does smoking eventually become a random thought here and there? I know it’s early days and it’s normal to think about it when it’s been a habit for a decade. I just wish I could just forget about it.

Today is my seventh day of being smoke free

Iâ€™m not gonna lie, I am moody as fuck! ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ I have a seriously short fuse. Actually I donâ€™t even think I have a fuse, I go from happy to murderous pretty quick. I donâ€™t know if thatâ€™s because Iâ€™ve been going off-script and cutting the patches down to 3/4 size for the last couple days (so maybe Iâ€™m having some nicotine withdrawal), or if itâ€™s the Zyban (it made me pretty freaking ragey at the starting dose, 150mg, so I never even made it to the 300, my doc prescribed a compounded 75mg dose and Iâ€™ve been on that ever since), or the interrupted sleep, or what, but yeah Iâ€™m not at my nicest right now. I do ok as long as I stay out of the annoyed zone haha.

Havenâ€™t been to a group since last Thursday and thereâ€™s some stinkinâ€™ thinkinâ€™ going on, I donâ€™t feel at risk of smoking but I am getting those pangs (oh wouldnâ€™t that be nice right now, I miss it, you all know!). I know though: thatâ€™s the addiction talking, just keep going! Strangely last week my worst cravings were right when I was leaving the smoking support groups, group therapy is good in some ways but also quite annoying in others so I think thatâ€™s what was going on there. I have one tomorrow so I will see, and I might talk about that at the group itself and see what people say. 

Anyway I would say itâ€™s gotten both easier and harder; easier in the sense that I have a bit of time behind me, harder in the sense that I really need to get a handle on this temper; I havenâ€™t actually said or done anything untoward but I would like to stop wanting to! I am looking forward to going back to my usual semi-grumpy self. ðŸ˜‚

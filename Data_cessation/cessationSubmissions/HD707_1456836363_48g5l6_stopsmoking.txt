51st Day and I'm losing it.

This is the longest I've been smoke free in last 8 years. Fortunately, the first 3-4 days, it has been a smooth ride till today. Thanks to you guys mostly for the motivation. 

I'm got an interview call for  my dream job today and it's making me really nervous. 

These cravings won't pass.. Any help?

Edit:
Still struggling with the cravings. But I didn't light up. Day ends for me here. Can't thank you all enough. 

To all in the same situation, you are bigger than that stick. This helped me get through the toughest day. Hope it will help you too.

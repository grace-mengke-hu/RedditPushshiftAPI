Unexpected benefit of being an ex-smoker.

Happy New Years r/stopsmoking! 

I am proud of myself because I didn’t smoke or vape last night despite getting pretty drunk. Also everyone at the party seemed to have a JUUL so temptation was all around!

Today when I got dressed I realized that I can wear my pants from last night again today! Never would be able to do that as a smoker because all of my clothes would smell like an ashtray.

Good luck to any New Years resolution quitters but remember you don’t need luck! It’s the best thing you can ever do for yourself and your body and mind will thank you.

Love,

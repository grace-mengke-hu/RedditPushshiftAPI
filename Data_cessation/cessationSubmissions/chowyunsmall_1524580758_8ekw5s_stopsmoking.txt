I came here to read, occasionally comment, and I looked at my stats often to big up myself and reenforce when cravings came. Today is my 1 year without smoking!!

This subreddit has been half my mental toolset for quitting, I toggle between this for the human side of quitting and ‘smoke free’ app for the data side. 

I used nicotine replacement therapy via a vaporizer, that I only use at home, at night.  For that, I cut the nicotine content down slowly over time to nearly 0. 

I wanted to share some of my tools with this community in case they are useful.

Also, I hope people know that there are plenty of folks reading through who know what you are going through and are wishing you well! As they are struggling through the first parts, know we are here and care!  I feel like I made it to the other side, I’m not craving-free but I’ve got my tools ready and I can manage them when they come. 

And they are way less frequent!

At this point, my mind jumps immediately to - what a colossal waste of effort if I give in now. 

Anyways thanks for support I’ve received here. And take heart, keep going guys!

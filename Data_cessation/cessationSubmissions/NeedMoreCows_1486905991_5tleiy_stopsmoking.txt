I feel like a powerless slave

Hey there.
I've been a smoker for 12 years, and only in the last year have I decided to really quit. I've tried just cold-turkey, e-cigarette, patches, group meeting. I have failed them all, and it's chipped at me.

I just finished reading Allen Carr's book, and it was actually quite helpful in the sense that it gave me a different perspective, but it didn't sink in I guess. Maybe I should read it again and again.

I've come to the point where I feel 100% enslaved, no illusion of what it's doing to me, but I cannot for the life of me stop. I'm really at my wits end, and I don't know what to do.

What do you think could help; has anybody felt like this? 

I just don't know how to stop :,(

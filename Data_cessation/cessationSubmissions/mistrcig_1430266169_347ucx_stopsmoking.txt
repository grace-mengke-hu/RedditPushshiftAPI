First visit. Day 5.

Hey, all.  I just stumbled across this subreddit.  It seems like a very valuable tool in the fight to stay off the cancer sticks.

I'm on day 5 of no smoking.  Before I quit I was up to a pack a day for 3 years. I'm only 25, but the effects were definitely being felt.  I had to quit. This time was different.  I felt it in my heart when I ran out.  This was it.  I was going to be a person who didn't smoke anymore.

So far, so good.  I feel refreshed.  I feel healthier.  I can breathe a little better (at least without coughing) and my sense of smell is through the roof. 

I don't want to have that crutch.  Its not who I am, and its not who I want to be.

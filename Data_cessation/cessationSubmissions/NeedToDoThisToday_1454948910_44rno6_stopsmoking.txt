Day One... Again.

I'm 28 years old and I've been smoking a pack a day since I was 14. I'm just sick and tired of it. Before I was 18 it was so cool to smoke. I love smoking. Now its just a disgusting habit I have no idea how to quit. I've done it before. I quit for 8 months one time and a year another time but something happens and usually throws me off course. I'm married with 2 wonderful boys with another one on the way. My wife doesn't know I still smoke she thinks I quit over a year ago. I'm sick of hiding it from her, I'm sick of smelling like shit and feeling like shit. I know I need to quit for every possible reason I just can't seem to get over that first hump. I only smoke at work and I don't smoke when I'm home. It's so easy to shut it off at home now I just need to quit at work. Sorry if this was a rant as you can tell I have no where else to turn to talk to anybody. Wish me luck guys. Hopefully today is the first day of my long recovery.

Need a better explanation than mine

Hello everybody,
I have quit 5 months ago and I have to admit that cravings have almost disappeared provided that I don't get really bored.
Anyway, there is something else which puzzles me: I can call it a meal without a smoke, but I find it really hard to call it a day and go to bed without *doing something*: if I'm lucky I end up eating a teaspoon of peanut butter or a dozen of nuts, otherwise I keep on feeling the need to chew on something.
I have always consumed massive amounts of chewing gum, but I used to think it was because of smoking-related bad breath.
Now I don't have a scapegoat for my oral fixation.

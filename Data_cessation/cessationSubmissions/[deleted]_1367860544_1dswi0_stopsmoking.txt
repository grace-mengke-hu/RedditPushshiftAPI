So I am on day 1 1/2 right now...

And I am not really sure how I can get through the rest of the day. Being at the office like I am now is probably the best place for me. My coworkers dont smoke and are very supportive of me beginning the quitting process. The problem lies well on my way home - I face ALOT of traffic on my commute home, making it my least favorite part of my day without cigs. Then when I get home, I live with my boyfriend which is great, but he smokes. And he is also not ready to quit yet. I cant even be in the same room as him after hes went out for a smoke. I hid in our bedroom all day yesterday.

I just need some help and tips to help me get through the rest of today. I could use some support right now, because I am just going to get tortured when I get home from work :(

Day 7- Losing it

Somehow managed six days of cold turkey. Day 7- I’ve lost it. I kept looking for my friend in college hoping to bump into him at the smoking corner so I could just bum a drag from his hand-rolled cigarette. You see my mind told me that if I bumped into him and only took a drag from his less unhealthy hand rolled tobacco as a social obligation, it would not count as smoking. Of course I didn’t find him there. So I messaged him a rather random “yo, sup” just hoping for him to say he’s going to smoke and can meet me there. He didn’t respond. Disappointed, I went back home. As soon as I entered the house, my SO started talking condescendingly to me to clean up the house coz my shit was all over the place. I’m living out of my suitcase because my SO occupied my drawers, so I currently have no place to keep my clothes. Plus my SO is not supportive in this process of me trying to quit, so I’m alone in this. It just made me so mad, so incredibly mad, that all I wanted to do was smoke a cigarette to calm myself down. I’m walking all around the apartment now and I’m angry and annoyed and all I need is one cigarette! Help. Sigh. 

EDIT- Nevermind. Somehow waited it out till the nearest convenience store shut for the night. Now I have nowhere to go to buy any. And I looked at some ugly lung pictures for good measure. Should keep me off the cravings for a few more hours.

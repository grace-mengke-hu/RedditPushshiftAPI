What works for me

Just want to say hi to everyone.  Been lurking mostly for a few weeks, finally packed it in last week.  This sub has been a great motivator.
I was a pack a day smoker for 25 years until December 27th.  Can't believe it's almost been a week.  I want to share a tip that's been working for me with any new quitters out there.  It may sound dumb, but I've been using toothpicks.  After meals, when I step out the door, driving, any time I used to put a smoke to my lips I've been using a wooden toothpick instead.  I carry a little box of them around with me.  It's doing the trick.  I haven't gone this long without a puff since 1992!

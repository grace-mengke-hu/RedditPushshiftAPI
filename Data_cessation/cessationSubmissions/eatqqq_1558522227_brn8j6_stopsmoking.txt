Do you consider people who quit smoking switched to vaping really quited?

First of all i want to say i have no stand here, this is not a debate but i just want to know your opinion.

The reason is that i quit smoking 3 months ago, switched to vaping until now, i'm sure i will never look back. i never thought quitting smoking is that easy. But when i tell my friends about this MOST of them said 'meh thats not quitting' something like that. At first i'll still explain how vaping is better than smoking, but now i just smile and let them say whatever

But since here in this subreddit most of u guys have the same target, which is to quit smoking, so i want to know what you think about people who quit smoking switched to vaping? Do u consider it a success quit or do u think as long as still depend on nicotine ur still not considered as 100% quit?

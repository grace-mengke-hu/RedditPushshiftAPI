Day 2

Made it another day. Working through the craving. I say craving because it has not really been coming and going in waves. It's more like a constant itch. Ironically a bit like a piece of something is missing in my chest, like some of my lung just said "Adios homie". And it feels like my teeth are itchy haha. I slept a lot. The dog and I cuddled a lot. I ate plenty of chocolate and chewed gum so hard my jaw is sore. And ICE WATER. So much ice water. But I'm on day 2. Making progress. Thank you guys for the support.

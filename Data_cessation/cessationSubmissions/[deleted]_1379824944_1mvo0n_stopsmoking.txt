You assholes somehow tricked me into quitting smoking! 4.5 hours now. Thanks! What's tomorrow going to be like?

I downloaded the EasyWay video from thepiratebay.org after hearing yall talk about the book.  I couldn't smoke after that.  Or probably more accurately, I could attempt quitting after watching that.  And I did.

So far, I'm loving it.  Fuck those cravings.  I keep reaching for a cigarrette, then remember.  Then, HAHA fuck you nicotine!  or something.  

I'm gonna lay out some clothes so the first thing i can do in the morning is get the fuck out of the house and walk a few miles.  Get away from that first cigarrette in the morning.

Motherfucker, I can't believe I got hooked on nicotine this long and fucked my health up however much it has.  Damn.  Wish I didn't do that.  At least it stopped.

Been smoking for 20 years now.  You tricky fuckers!  I don't know if I would have gotten here without y'all.  

Thanks for the way this subreddit is with lurkers.

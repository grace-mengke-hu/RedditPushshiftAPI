Day 7 and feeling great but gonna be dancing with the devil in the pale moonlight tonight....

So, here I am at a week in and feeling really good about it. I’ve put on a few pounds but that’s no big deal, i actually am enjoying having an appetite and being able to taste food again! My cravings are getting less frequent and less severe, I no longer think about cigarettes when I first wake up and there are moments where I can go hours now without thinking about smoking.

Tonight is a friends birthday party, I’m going to be in a very heavy smoking environment and I’m determined not to smoke, if I have to leave the party so be it but I’m proud of myself for making it this far. If I fall off the wagon though and have a cheeky puff, I’m not gonna beat myself up about it later because if I know I can do one week, I can do a thousand! People, throw your aspirational quotes at me, send me your power, pray for me when I’m a few beers in tonight!

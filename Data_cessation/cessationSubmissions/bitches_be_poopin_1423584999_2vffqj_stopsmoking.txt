First celebration sans cigarettes and I earned my first star today!

GUYS. I'm so excited! 

I acted in a short film that was submitted to a competition. We shot it a few weeks ago when I was still clawing my eyes out over my cold turkey quit. Last night was the awards ceremony and our film WON FIRST PLACE! Usually after a victory like that I would go right to a congratulatory cig but the thought never even crossed my mind. And now I log on to this sub and see my first star? I'm a month nicotine free?! YES! I'm so jazzed!

Let's not smoke today!

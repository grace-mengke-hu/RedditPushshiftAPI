Cardio

Hello fellow non-smokers, today is a full week since I quit and I am starting to think about getting into jogging/sprinting as a way to get my lung function back to normal quicker. Does anyone know if it accelerates the process any noticable degree? Because if not I might hold off a few more weeks to where it doesn't feel like I have a light cold when I run. 

Breathing difficulties is always the most frustrating part when I am trying to quit, and I've yet to really last long enough for them to subside, so it's really discouraging. I also feel like stressing my lungs a lot right now might make me feel worse and give up. Sorry to rant/complain. Stay healthy everybody :).

EDIT: Also if this has been addressed in another post you are aware of if you could direct me to it I would be very greatful. I tried using the search function but I know it is not the greatest.

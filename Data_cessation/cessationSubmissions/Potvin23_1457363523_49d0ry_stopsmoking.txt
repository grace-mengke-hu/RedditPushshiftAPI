Day 67 - I've always wondered what a cigarette craving feels like for other people.

I've always thought everyone experiences smoke cravings the same.  Until I asked my friend and his description was different from mine.

For myself, it feels like my chest is tightening up, almost comparable to the nervous 'butterflies in the stomach' feeling though a little higher up.  It feels like there's this odd pressure on my chest that can only be relieved by toxic smoke.

My friend just described it as his mind only being able to think of smoking, he's never felt a physical craving.

What's a cigarette craving feel like to you /r/stopsmoking ?

2 months quit, Depression

I quit smoke just over 2 months ago and lately the past few weeks have been extremely stressful with losing my job, actually more like getting shafted at work. Anyway among many little hinges that have been building into a great big ball of frustration I have managed to pull through and not cave. And to be truthful I really managed without losing it! 

Now just over the 2 month mark I am finding myself extemelly depressed! It's my daughters birthday today and it should be such a happy day. My relationship is suffering because I am feeling do down and unhappy. I'm sitting here with a smoke in my hand tears streaming just wanting to light it so bad, just so I can go to bed, go to sleep and hopefully wake up feeling a little better.

My partner attempts to quit every single week so mon to wed he is irritable and withdrawn, by Wed night or Thurs he has bought himself a new pack and I know the whole process is going to begin all over again the following week. I have been living with this for 3 years. I think maybe I just need a break from all the stressor around me.

Is a sudden onset of depression normal at 2 months causing me to feel worse about everything else wrong at the moment, or has everything just built up to boiling point and I'm in need of a release? ??

I'm a 32 yo female 13 year old daughter, been a single mum her whole life up until my current partner of 1 year (living together for 3) I work full time and almost solely look after the household so me time is non existent. 

Under appreciated.

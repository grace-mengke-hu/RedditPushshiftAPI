The craving to smoke just one..

Hey... Its my day 20th.. I know i have gone through this far.. But i seriously need some major help from some fellow quitters.. I start to lose hope sometimes, and want to smoke just one cigarette, it seems so harmless at times. Its less of a craving and more of a depression that wants me to smoke. And there are times when the craving to smoke a hash cigarette comes up. Its very less tobacco.. What should i do? I used to smoke tea as an alternative but thats harmful too so I stopped that..

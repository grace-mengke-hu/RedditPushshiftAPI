no cigarettes on November 7 and no nicotine for almost a week now :)

I'm so happy!!! Absolutely no patches or lozenges as of sunday. I was walking to get coffee sunday with my boyfriend and I asked him to keep my lozenges, and also threw away my patch I had on. I had a whole 3 other tubes of lozenges and a pack of patches and I decided I was ready!

I know I have been a little obsessed with Monopoly since I started to use the patches less, and have been substituting with jolly ranchers for the lozenges. The brain fog was pretty strong, and that led me to feeling like I needed Monopoly lol, but I just kept telling myself it'll go away.

Last time I stopped for a while, I smoked a cigarette for my boyfriend and now I realize that was a horrible choice. Hope I don't do that again :). It was so bad because I did it so deliberately, I just wanted to make him feel better. I was so mad when I started to get hooked again, just because of that one cigarette.

1 week smoke free! Going from utterly depressed to thankful I don't have to go outside to smoke anymore!

When I'm angry I still want to smoke, but generally I feel a lot better about not smoking.

I was having a breakdown the first 3 days after I quit, but it is getting a lot easier now!

Anyone thinking about giving up on quitting, trust me, you can do it~!

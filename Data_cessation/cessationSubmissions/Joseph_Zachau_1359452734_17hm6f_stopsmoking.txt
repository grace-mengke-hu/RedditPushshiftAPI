Any help to get rid of the psychological addiction ? 

Hey /r/stopsmoking 

So, I've been trying to quit many, many times over the last couple of years - and even succeeded temporarily (2-3months). I've smoked since I was 18, so going on 6-7 years now, 20' a day. However, I reckon my addiction is mostly a psychological one. Having gone through a couple of stressful relationships, and being in law-school - I realize my pattern, and why I keep falling back in. Every time I get in a fight with my SO, or worry about something, be it personal or career based, I start craving. 

Any tips on how to break this vicious cycle ? - a substitute destressor, or something;- I feel like I've lured myself into a pavlovian corner, where smoking is the only way to relieve stress.

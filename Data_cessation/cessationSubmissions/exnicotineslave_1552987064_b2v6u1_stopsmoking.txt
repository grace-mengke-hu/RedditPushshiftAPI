3 days down with Champix

 I decided to jump on champix to kick my 17 year habbit because my cold turkey attempts were failing. Im now 3 days  down and it really has been the easiest attempt yet. Ive just finished the 2nd week of champix. Only side effects are vivid dreams, and if I  take them too late I dont sleep. But I have been counteracting that with a sleeping pill if I forget to take my night pill early.

I feel soooo excited about it this time. Like different than every before.

So far the benefits are great -

• My breathing is much better

• My heart rate has dropped 20bpm

• I have more energy

• My sense of smell is coming back

• Im eating more (thats good for me as im trying to bulk)

• My skin doesnt look any different, but it feel sooo smooth (face). It really is amazing

Something  thats a little bit annoying was I had tingling legs and feet last night  in bed and made it harder to sleep. From research its just because of  the extra bloodflow and oxygen circulating. 

I visited a few mates  today that smoked. The stink was terrible, I didnt even want one at  all. I cant stand the smell. I went into a dairy today and the guy in  front of me mustve been a smoker, because he really stank. Can believe I  smelt like that. Just enjoying the simple things like when I picked a  courgette from the vege garden today I got that instant scent when I  snapped it off. Im really excited.

To anyone else struggling cold  turkey, give champix a try. It really has worked amazing for me so far.  And its only been 3 days!!! Cant wait for the other benefits to come.

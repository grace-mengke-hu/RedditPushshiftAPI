I quit. For real this time.

I'm 27 and have been smoking for ten years now. I have regretted starting since year four. I also recently had a grandmother die of lung cancer from smoking for over 50 years. I have said I was quitting so many times before, and am ashamed of myself that I am still spending money on a box that is going to put me in a box. So, I am writing this in hopes of a new start. Day one begins now.

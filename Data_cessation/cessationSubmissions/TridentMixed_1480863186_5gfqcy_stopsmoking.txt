Going to make this one count

Hello!  36/m and I've pretty much been a smoker since I was 16.  I've also always been quite a chain smoker and even recently I would smoke damn near 2 packs a day due to a self-defeatist attitude.

Anyways, I've tried to quit many times before, usually with the patch or nicorette, but the longest I've gone is 3 years after doing it cold turkey more than 10 years ago.

In a way, I'm doing it cold turkey again, but I'm also using Chantix.  However, I quit on the same day I started using Chantix due to a tooth extraction and not being able to smoke so I figured what the hell.

I threw away my last 2 cigs and it's going on 4 days now since my last one.  Looking forward to getting back into the gym and saving lots of money.

Also, my wife is quitting too, although she's only a social smoker, which to this day I still don't fully understand lol

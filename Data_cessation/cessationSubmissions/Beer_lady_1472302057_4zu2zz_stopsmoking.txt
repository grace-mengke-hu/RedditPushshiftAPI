Another obstacle overcome!

I have been smoke free for a month!!!!

Last night my usual smoking buddy had a cigar and an e-cig right in front of me. I had a brief craving which I charted in the StopSmoking app. Honestly, I just wanted to smoke with him out of habit, not even because I really needed one.

Also this week I didn't even want to stop at a gas station to pick up more after a fight with someone important to me. 

I feel this this week was filled with multiple pivotal moments for me and I feel stronger for it. 

Thanks for your help! Carry on with your day.

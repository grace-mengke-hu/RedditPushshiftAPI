2 weeks, holding strong

Checking in after 2 weeks. Kind of proud of the nr.2 circle badge :)  Smooth sailing the last few days, sleeping getting better, gained 2 kg (fuck it, i'll start to mind my food intake and start running), work efficiency slowly comming back.  I'we been lurking on this forum a lot, helps me focus on the reasons I quit. Read about cravings around 3 weeks in and expecting the devil. Planing telling him to fuck off when he's here...

Keep it going, everybody. Cheers!

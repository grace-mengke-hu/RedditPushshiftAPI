Going cold turkey. How can I keep myself on the straight and narrow?

If you asked me a week ago I would tell you that I don't plan on quitting smoking. After injuring my hand and breaking several fingers along with some lacerations my doctor tells me I must quit or my bones might not heal well. I haven't had one since this morning but the craving is getting stronger with every passing second. How can I stop myself from caving in to my addiction? You'd think the threat of fucking up my fingers would be enough but I just tell myself that I won't smoke as much. How do I keep myself strong?

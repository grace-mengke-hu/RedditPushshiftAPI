I am feeling guilty

Hi everyone.

I have been "smoke free" for 1 year, 4 months, and 11 days but recently been social smoking rolled tobacco cigarettes. I also regularly put tobacco in my bong bowls but I still consider myself regular cigarette free.

Everytime I smoke rolled tobacco I feel like I have thrown all my progress out the window. What I justify it with is that I dont smoke a half a pack or a pack a day anymore. For me its habit. Like smoking in the car, or with friends, or any time I am outside. I dont crave cigarettes anymore either but can I really say that I quit? People offer me cigarettes and I decline their offer. I am over regular cigarettes. Even when I smoke rolled cigs it doesnt trigger my cravings. I can see people smoke and I have no interest anymore.

I also dont know how to roll a joint or tobacco cigs. If noone is here to rool then I dont smoke.

I guess I am just venting here. 

Would you guys consider me as a cigarette quitter or am I just fooling myself in believing that I am not a smoker anymore?

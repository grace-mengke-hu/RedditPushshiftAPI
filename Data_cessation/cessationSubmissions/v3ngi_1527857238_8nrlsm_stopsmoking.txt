Need to quit smoking!

To much money wasted, spending close to $300.00 a month (live in northeast us)! That money can be used for so many other things other then getting lung cancer. Ready and willing to do what I deserve which is to STOP SMOKING, BUT what does everyone replace it with? Only reason I smoke now is so I can have 5 minutes (20 times a day) to think deeply and realign my compass. With out that I am afraid I will get lost and that 5 minutes of zoning out will become an all day event! Always been physically active doing things such as working out sprinting (strange)... Need something to become addicted to and think running or exercising can replace that. Anyone have advice, I want to stop tomorrow, can not take the stupidity anymore!

Quitting only to start again

*THIS IS NOT A TROLL POST*

it's been 5 months since I stopped smoking (started at 13 I'm 28 now), my reason? I want to have the feeling I had when I smoked my first cigarette. Sounds stupid Ik but I fucking love cigarettes, I love it so much I quit so I can't start again so I'll be able to taste it again, I like smelling the cig and taking a big whiff of the tobacco inside before I light up. I knew the minute I smoked a cigarette that one day i will get cancer or a heart related problem that's gonna cause my death. I've accepted that fact so I'm not going to be one of those people who blame everyone and everything but themselves. I've told my friends and family about this and they all told me the same thing : it's never going to feel like that ever again, doesn't matter how long you quit. This really upset me and now Idk wth to do.. Idk if I should keep going or just say the hell with it and light up again. Any real advice would be appreciated. Now down vote away ladies and gents.

Broke my streak :-(

I recently made it 12 days without a cigarette. Unfortunately last night I broke my streak. I was leaving a party while tipsy, and with a friend who decided to have a smoke. Unfortunately my will power did not hold up, and I had one.

Any pointers on how to keep the streak going? I don't want to hide from my friends to stop smoking...

Chantix so far

I started Chantix 8 days ago to help with my nicotine addiction. So far it’s been helping a lot. Before I was on it, If I lost my vape I would stop everything I was doing (no matter WHAT) and look for it until I found it, and if I couldn’t find it I would go buy another without thinking twice. The other day I had my vape in my hand, I lost it, and said “eh oh well” instead of going crazy trying to find it. I’ve vaped 4 times today as opposed to 20 times every hour like I used to. I’m very optimistic. The dreams are INSAAAASNE and I honestly like sleeping more bc of how realistic and vivid my dreams are.

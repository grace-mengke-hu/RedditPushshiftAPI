Severe withdrawal symptoms - all the more reason for motivation

So now I'm 5 days in quitting, have extreme nausea, vomit, feel lightheaded and dizzy all day, and have chest clogs.

Some people say this makes them crave a cigarette more, but for me it's the opposite. I haven't thought about quitting consciously up until now while I was literally too busy for a smoke for a couple of days. Then the symptoms started to appear, and I was like, damn. I'm this addicted? I should quit.

So, yeah. If you have severe withdrawal symptoms, it's all the more reason you should motivate yourself more and quit. It feels like I'm gonna have a heart attack any second now, but I'll know in a couple of weeks things are going to be okay.

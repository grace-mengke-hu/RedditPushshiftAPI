Second time quitting

Hello every one I've been inspired by you guys to quit smoking for the second time.
 The first time I decided to quit smoking was after seven years of smoking I stopped for five months and it was very hard at first but when I started smoking again I would come to this subreddit and see how amazing it is to quit and I did
 This is the second time for me, I've stopped completely and it's been two weeks now and I feel great
The first time I stopped I used nicotine patches and it was irretating but now im using nicotine gum and even though it taste bitter they are helping me alot now my urges are next to zero and I can breath much better now I feel great for not smoking.
When I decided to stop I threw away my cigarettes, I bought the nicotine replacement I wanted to use and I only needed it for five days, the first day I told all my friends and family that I've stopped smoking.
Thank you all and I wish you all the best

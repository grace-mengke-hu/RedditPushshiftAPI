Birthdayparty coming up in 2 days. There is gonna be alcohol!

Hi fellas,

I really don't wanna mess up but I always used to smoke while I drink and I don't know how well I will be able to handle the situation.

Luckily there will not be many smokers at the party so that's a good thing I guess.

Any tips on how to handle cravings while drunk?

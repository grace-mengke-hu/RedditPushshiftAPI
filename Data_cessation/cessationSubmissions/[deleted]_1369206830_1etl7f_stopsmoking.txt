In need of some advice!

My very awesome husband and I quit smoking together (so my tag is the same as his quitting time).

I've been quite alright with the quitting, feeling very motivated and my mood hadn't been affected greatly (I do have binges, but I'm controlling it).

However, my very awesome husband is *depressed*. He has PTSD (he got off the anti depressants about a year ago, after 10 years, obviously under supervision) and I think it makes his experience a lot more difficult. He spends most of his days saddened and he tells me that the only thing keeping him from smoking is, well, me (other than the fact that he wants to save money and so on).

**Edited to emphasize this:** I tried telling him that if he's not completely sure of his decision, it may be the reason it's affecting him this way, but he tells me he's very sure, so I believe him (I have to). *Meaning, I told him I don't care if he smokes, but he insists on wanting to quit.*

Now comes the where-I-need-advice: I'm looking for something to make him happy, something to help distract him, so I was wondering if anyone else had these symptoms, would love to hear how long it took to go away and how did you cope with it, other than eating? (My mechanism!)

If it's relevant, he mostly likes spending his time gaming, so I doubt trying to take him out for a trip or something will help. He also likes shopping (I am a lucky girl), but we've had large expenses this month and he thinks they "override" our cigarette savings. Don't wanna argue there.

Phew!

tl;dr HELP me help my husband cope with withdrawal!

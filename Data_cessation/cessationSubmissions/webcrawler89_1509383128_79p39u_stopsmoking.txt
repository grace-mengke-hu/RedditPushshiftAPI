Patch Marks won't go away

Hello. 

Like many of you here, I'm trying nicotine patches to help me quit. I just finished Step 1 of the Habitrol patches and am on Step 2. My issue is that, besides the itching and rash, I still marks, like big circles, on me from the first patches, it's been a couple weeks and they won't go away. Any idea how long it takes for these patch marks to disappear? I look like I've been attacked by giant leeches.

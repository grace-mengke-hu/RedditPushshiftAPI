Not ready yet.. but have some questions.

Started smoking 30 years ago. I have quit 3 times, only while I was pregnant. Currently, I smoke a pack a day of reds. Recently I started keto and intermittent fasting and have lost a lot of weight so far. Yay! Now, I don't want to end up gaining weight back if I try to quit again. Even though I was pregnant when I quit before, I know I gained it from overeating too. It feels like, without nicotine, the metabolism slows down a lot. How do you quit smoking without gaining weight? That is a big deal to me, since I'm almost down to where I want to be.
How long do the withdrawal symptoms last, typically? I see some people say a couple weeks, others a few days. I honestly can't remember since it's been about 14 years since I quit last time. I do remember, it sucked and i felt miserable for awhile.
Next question, you may think I'm kooky, but it's real to me. Is anyone else empathic, very sensitive to others emotions, overwhelmed in social situations, seem to feel an electric static in crowds, tend to need time alone to settle it all down? My SO has bpd. It makes life very hard. Sometimes, when moods snap back and forth so fast, I have to separate myself from that space. These are the main reasons I smoke. If I could find a way to cope through the anxiety of the environment without turning to cigarettes to settle everything, I think I could quit for good. I use that time to think about what just happened, balance out emotion, and try to forget about it. It usually works. Problem is, I have an addiction to nicotine and feel the need to light up even without all the stressful triggers. I realize it needs to stop. If anyone else is empathic, but still managed to quit, How do you cope now? If anyone else loves someone with bpd, how do you manage to not smoke while you're biting your tongue not to lash back? How do you settle your nerves and contain that anger that smoking helps suppress?

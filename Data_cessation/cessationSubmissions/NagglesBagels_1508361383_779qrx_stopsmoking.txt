Thank you allen carr!

Hey all you quitters! I just wanted to say thanks to this sub for pointing me to Allen Carr's easy way to quit. Read most of it in two nights and tonight after work I plan on finishing it and having my last smoke before I become a non-smoker as per the books instructions. For the first time out of dozens of "quits" I feel somewhat excited instead of dreading the days to come. The book puts things into perspective much more than I anticipated!

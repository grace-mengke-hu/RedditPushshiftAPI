Forget the money. Consider how much time you're saving.

As I write this, I have been smoke-free for 1 year, 243 days, 12 hours, 14 minutes, and 13 seconds.  When I first quit, I made a spreadsheet showing me a couple of statisticts.  None of it is too surprising- I knew I'd be saving money, for instance.  But one thing that really struck me is how much *time* I've saved.  Usually, when I smoked, I'd stop whatever I was doing and go in my garage.  If I assume I smoked 20 cigarettes a day at only 3 minutes a cigarette (being conservative, I think), then I've saved 25.35 FULL DAYS of time.  608.4 hours sitting in a chair, breathing smoke.  Astounding.

BTW: 20 times 3 is 60, so my number of days smoke free will always equal the number of hours I would have wasted smoking.

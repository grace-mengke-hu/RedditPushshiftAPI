Just want to share a couple things...

Not sure how much of this is science, and how much is coincidence.

I am having the easiest time quitting (compared to my last quit), and just want to share what I did different since my last slip up.  
After my last slip up, I smoked regularly for about 8 months.

1. I smoke only organic tobacco - I believe this matters as 'regular' cigarettes are only about 5% tobacco, believe we are getting addicted to far more than just nicotine.  Just a belief, don't crucify me.

2. I smoked about an hour after waking up, never right after, never on an empty stomach.

3. Worked out almost the entire time.  One period of about a month (december) where I was really lazy (down to 1-2 a week, but in general 4x a week).

4. With the gym, always had one eye on my diet.  Not always super healthy, but very conscious.

5. Did not allow myself to smoke EVERYTIME i got in a car - I did do it a lot, but every once in a while, i would deliberately smoke right before or right after my trip.
 
I wanted to share because I really believe one of these four things, maybe all, is having a huge factor.  Maybe not - but if it worked for me, may work for another.

I am on day 4 and have not yet had a panic attack debate on whether to smoke a cigarette or not.  On my 1st and second attempts, pretty much every cigarette I would have had was a panic attack fight.

Hope this helps at least one person.

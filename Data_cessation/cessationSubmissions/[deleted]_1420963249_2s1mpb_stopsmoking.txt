Smacking temptation in the face

I'm quit 34 days - pack and a half/day.  In my head, I thought that it should be a process, and I never expected that I wouldn't smoke again.  I always thought and expected that I'd cheat at some point.  I've had the urge many times, but I put it off.  That's what I've done... I've just put it off.

Tonight, I worked it all out in my mind.  This was the night - I would cheat tonight.  I would have a smoke and then I'd put the rest of the pack out in the barn and I wouldn't touch them.  I thought it all through and I worked it out logically, assuring myself that quitting is a process and that it was okay to have a ceremonial smoke.  After all, I'd earned it.    

I stood at the counter at the convenience store and spoke those magic words that I'd missed so much, "A pack of Pall Mall Blue long, please", and then I drove home with the pack in my shirt pocket.

I parked the car and wasn't home a moment before I went out into my screen room and to my favorite chair.  I pulled the pack of cigarettes out of my pocket and I slipped off the silvery plastic shield.  But before I opened the box, I stopped to think about how far I had come.  I've made it 34 days.  I've been able to handle it, I've managed these 34 days.  It's not been easy, but I've made it this far.  And every one of these 34 days has been worth it.  

I heard a voice say, "No, I'm not doing this".  I didn't realize right off that the voice was mine, until I was up from my favorite chair and in the kitchen.  I crammed the pack of Pall Malls into the garbage disposal, ran the water and flipped the switch.  And as the machine chewed the pack into oblivion, I saluted with my free hand, and said, "Fuck you".

I came really close to failing tonight.  But once again, I put it off.  I'm putting off that cheat.  And I'll keep on doing that until it doesn't mean anything anymore.

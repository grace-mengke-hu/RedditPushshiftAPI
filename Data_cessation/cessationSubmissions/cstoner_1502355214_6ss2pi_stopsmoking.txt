Checking in after ... wait... what?! 1609 days. That has to be a typo

I am so proud of all of you quitters. You 4 dayers, especially. That was the hardest. But you made it this far and if you have a smoke now you're back to day 0...

I dunno, that image always helped me. The idea that you're through the worst of it and if you smoked again that you'd be back to square 1.

Here's what I've learned after 1609 days of being nicotine free:

* Cold turkey is the only thing that ever worked for me.
* I was never going to quit for anyone but myself. Don't ever quit for anyone but yourself.
* It took me a long, LONG, time... but fresh cigarette smoke doesn't smell good any more. That took like 3 and a half years.
* Despite that, I still have dreams about smoking again. And every single one is about how big of an idiot I am.
* I dream about being unprepared for a test WAY WAY WAY more frequently than I dream about smoking. Fuck you, chemistry! But also, that's pretty neat.
* I stopped checking this subreddit a few years ago, but it helped me so much that I thought I'd post some encouragement to y'all.

I actually don't think I could have done it without you. Good luck everyone!

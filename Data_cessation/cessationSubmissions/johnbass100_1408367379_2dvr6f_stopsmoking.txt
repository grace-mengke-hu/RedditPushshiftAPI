6 month mark

The Reddit forum helped me quit smoking.  Lately, I have not been active here, as the smoking thing has gotten a lot easier.  I appreciate everyone's help.

Want to quit?  Just NEVER take another PUFF!!  Really, that is all there is too it.  I know it seems hard but you can do it.....

A little app I had running popped up today (I forgot I had it running)  Today, it shows I did not smoke 4077 cigs.  Jeez , why did I smoke for so long?   That is lot of cigs.....

Done with the 72 hour detox. What now?

Is there a new mile stone I can focus on reaching? Will it be easier, and if so, how much? Anything I should look out for?

This is my first attempt at cold turkey.

Edit: Background is I was a two pack-a-day smoker for ten years. I had quit for four weeks with the nicotine patch, and relapsed on Tuesday *hard*.

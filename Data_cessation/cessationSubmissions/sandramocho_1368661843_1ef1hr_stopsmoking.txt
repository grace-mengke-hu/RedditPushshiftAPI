drunk, alone, remembring old times. So hard not to smoke a litlle cigarette

i was going the say that i was having a bad day. The truth: i'm having a normal day. I just wanna complain about not been able to smoke, i am alone and thiking about all the fucking things in life that could go wrong. when i think about all these things that could go wrong, i feel like a cigarette it's the least of my troubles

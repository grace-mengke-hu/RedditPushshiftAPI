Former long time vapers, how long did it take for your cravings to subside?

I stopped smoking cigarettes in 2016 and have been vaping since then. I've been down to .3 mlg for well over a year now but I take way too many puffs per day and my dependency is bad.  My vape broke yesterday and I'm trying to just quit cold turkey because I've been considering it for a while. Today has been tough.  I know cravings come and go but I'm curious how long it took for nearly constant cravings to go away for someone who has been in a similar position. Thanks!

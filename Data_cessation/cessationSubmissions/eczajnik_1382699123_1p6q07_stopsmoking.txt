Why is everyone saying "If I can do it, you can too"? It pisses me off! :P

I remember that it was really discouraging to hear while I was a lurker. I felt as if someone told me that they are better than myself or that THEY had it bad and are saying that I can't be as addicted as them. Like I am just whining but have it easy but hey had it bad.

Plus, we don't know each other. If a friend told me that then it migh have been positive but.. Not this way.

I am genuinely curious - has anyone gotten any strength from reading that? 

And, dear lurkers, we are all addicted to the same substance. And be it a month of smoking or 20 years we are all addicted the same! No one has it better or worse!

Each and everyone of you can quit not because some of us already did but because the addcition can be broken! We'll help you with that! No need to be affraid, it's MUCH better on the other side. Join us whenever you want to, we'll wait.

3 weeks in, moving on to the next phase

Now that I'm officially 3 weeks quit, I've decided to start working on other areas of my health; namely, my weight.  I have been overweight for years and have always had a desire to do something about it, and with my new-found lung capacity I have started exercising.

I'm just starting up my routine and so my stamina after years of lethargy is pretty low, but I was able to walk for 1.5 miles and bike another 3 this last week.  I have a long ways to go to get my weight where I want it to be, but I love being able to do something a bit strenuous without gasping for air!

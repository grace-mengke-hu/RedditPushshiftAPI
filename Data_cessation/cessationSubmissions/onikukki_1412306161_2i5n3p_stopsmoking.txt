Are herbal cigarettes worth it?

I quit smoking about two years ago now. At first it was cold turkey, but I get the craving any time I drink coffee or alcohol, so I looked to herbal cigarettes. 

I tried a few roll-your-own blends, but they burned way too fast when compared to a normal cigarette. 

Eventually I stuck with Ecstasy cigarettes, a brand recommended to me by a friend in theater, where they used them as props for non-smoking actors. I bought a bunch of cartons on sale, and since I don't smoke much, it took me a long while to burn through them all. Just recently I've found out that the brand is no longer manufactured. 

I've tried smoke shops, but most of them are offended if I ask for a non-tobacco product. As for marijuana, it's still illegal where I live, and I'm not looking to get high, so I'm steering clear of it. 

Is there a brand that any of you would recommend? It seems like nobody makes an herbal that smokes like an actual cigarette.

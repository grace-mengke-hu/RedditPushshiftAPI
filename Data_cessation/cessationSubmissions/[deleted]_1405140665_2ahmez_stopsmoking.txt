Damn you time zone!

Up to do an Early shift in England and I have 21 days today...so gimme my badge! Please and thank you! 3 Weeks! No caffeine, no cigarettes and no alcohol! (and the only thing I crave anymore is caffeine). 

Three weeks guys and it gets so easy. I'm a non-smoker! After 25 years and I don't miss it! :))

And I was sure I wouldn't make it!

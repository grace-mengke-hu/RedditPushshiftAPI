Not sure if I am still getting over a cold...

...or if it is just the side effects of quitting cigarettes.  I definitely got sick, but even a week later I'm still somewhat congested and have been coughing up mucus out of my lungs.  Guess I'll have more of this to look forward to in the near future.

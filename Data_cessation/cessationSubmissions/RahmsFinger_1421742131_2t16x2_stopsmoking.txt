You guys really weren't kidding about the third week week being tough

This past weekend, I got to spend a lot of time with a dear friend, she was my houseguest, and has also become a non-smoker (she got there years ago, and I think it might have been Allen Carr, based on some things I gleaned). She said, "hey, let's both not smoke this weekend," and we didn't.

But Sunday after brunch, the bad cravings started, not super horrible, but they were maybe the worst yet. 

And by Monday I started to think, well, who will know if I have just one. It doesn't feel that different being a non-smoker. My brain was doing psychological gymnastics, just to get me to buy a pack.

And I re-read the stuff I highlighted in the Carr book, came to this sub, and then started to clean my house and keep busy.

Now it's Tuesday in the wee hours. Might be time I get back to running!!!

So, let's stay strong. All of you have got me through this far, so I want you all to join me today and not smoke at all. No matter how hard it may seem, it's so much better than smoking and having to reset our badges!

We can do this!

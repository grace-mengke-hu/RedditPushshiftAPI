Any Other Snus Users Wanting To Quit?

I know this is for people that have or are trying to quit smoking, but I don't feel the sub for quitting dip is nearly as active or motivational as this community.

I never liked cigarettes, which in some respects I think is a blessing. However, about 5 years ago I started using Swedish snus. Most are probably aware, but it's a smokeless tobacco pouch you put in your upper lip for the buzz. I was attracted to it because it doesn't require spitting and goo like traditional dip does, and obviously no smoking and coughing.

Nonetheless, it got my ass addicted to nicotine. So here I am, trying to free myself from the it.

I've read Allen Carr's Easyway a few times, and I have quit for periods of 3 months max but keep falling off the wagon.

I'm curious if anyone else on here has used this methods for quitting snus or dip? I know a lot of smokers/ex-smokers did a combination of cigs and dip etc.

Do you think his book/approach can still be applied to snus? My takeaway from it is really just freeing yourself from nicotine addiction, regardless of the device.

I think my mind tries to rationalize that since snus doesn't make you cough, smell, etc, then it's not as big of a deal to relapse or continue.

I know that's absurd, because it's still a costly nicotine addiction, and it's not healthy by any means...still can stain teeth and cause bad breath.

Sorry again if this technically isn't the right sub, but I feel like this is a supportive community for anybody trying to quit nicotine for good.

Time to start the decline.

Ive been smoking for 3 years now, and it's not gunna be easy to quit because of my job. I work as a tradesmen in the plumbing field and i get to take long car rides to job sites with two chain smokers and i have the pleasure of sitting in the middle of them... as for now im trying to decrease my habit to help break up with my favorite cancer stick. Any tips for this type of predicament?

Worked myself through Allen CarrÂ´s Audio Book

Yesterday I started listening to the audio book of Allen Carr. Its a 5 hour and 40 minutes long audio book. I made 3 hours and fifteen minutes yesterday and this morning at 5 AM I have gone through the other half of the book. After one and a half hour I stopped smoking besides while I was listening to it. And on the next day which is today I have not smoked and got through every craving like magic. I am not sure if this will last, in his audio book he was talking about the emtpyness which a cigarette brings to you. Something made click and since this moment I have not smoked anymore. I know it is not even 24 hours, just this time I made it over every craving.

The worst things is that I relapsed every day before that and my record where 24 hours without a cigarette. I am not sure if this will last but I got because of this another problem, I can not get myself towards something, I got no clue what to do. I am a schizophrenic and most of the time I walk across my room and sit from time to time at my computer. And not even here I know what to do. Or I am not willing to do something. I could do things like go for a walk, play WoW Battlegrounds, take my skateboard out and skate in front of the door. Just I am like with the idea, but not with the will to do something about it.

Maybe I am addressing stuff that is out of this scope. I just wanted to say that something has changed. Thanks.

About to go off the Gum. You can do it!!!

Hello all, I was a smoker for 10+ years and this is my 3rd attempt to quit. The first 2 times, I tried to quit cold turkey and after 3 months or so I found myself going back. This time, my Dr. suggested that I give the gum/patch a try. I opted for the gum. For those that tell you chewing the gum isn't quitting, "F Them". I say, "Would you rather me get my nicotine from a cigarette or from the gum?"  For me, it's been 10 times easier to wean off the gum. Instead of smoking every 1-2 hours, I can chew a piece of gum and be good for 4 hours or so. I'm now down to 3 pieces a day. It can be done. If you can't quit cold turkey, that doesn't make you a failure. Just keep making progress and you'll get there.

Update: 5 days off the gum now. Ran out of pieces and decided to give it a go at not having any nicotine. The worst times are the morning, right after coffee. And, I don't know if it's the nicotine withdraw, but I'm having some major sinus drainage right now. Every evening sucks. For those that quit cold turkey, "Good for you, I'm happy you were able to do it.". For those, like me, who are/were on the gum that's a great route also. It made it so much easier to quit. While I still have cravings they aren't nearly as bad as when I had quit cold turkey before.

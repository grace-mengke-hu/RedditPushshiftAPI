31 days free from smoking and I feel I'm about to break

Essentially I've been doing really well this is my first attempt to quit.   Yet the person that has helped me the most and was the one who started me on this journey pretty much just left my life in a complicated situation between the two of us.  Now I just feel like I want to smoke so bad but I feel if I do all of this would be for nothing.. Just feeling frustrated and tired.. Not looking for pity but I could use the support.  

Thanks guys and gals,
Dan

I'm going to quit smoking.

I've been smoking since I was 10 or 11 years old and am now 23. My grandpa had lung cancer and he quit smoking years ago. My boyfriends grandpa also has lung cancer. That shit is scary!

I decided what I need to do is stop drinking coffee and alcohol for a little bit. As well as, start training myself to do yoga and exercising. I'm also going to eat some veggies when I'm craving instead. This is going to be hard XD Any good tips to help me with this???

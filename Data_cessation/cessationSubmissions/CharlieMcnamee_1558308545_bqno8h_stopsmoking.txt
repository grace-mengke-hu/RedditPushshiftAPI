still getting cravings a year after quitting

I made it past a year a few days ago, I still want one every other day if not every day, today I was sweating and pacing around I wanted one so bad. what has been motivating me the past year was the hope that eventually they would go away and stop but I still get them and they are still bad.

Will this ever stop? I mean honestly, I am thinking of starting again this is no way to live.

Here we go again. Day #2

So sick of smoking. I am 39 years old and I been smoking since I was 17. I quit many many times. Longest was for almost 2 years. I was in an awesome shape then. Worked out, looked good, felt good.

Now, 39 years old, I am out of shape, gained 25 lbs, lazy. I have no motivation to do ANYTHING. My chest is hurting me in the mornings, I eat like shit, stopped exercising. Enough of this! Time to get back to my old "me". I am sick of smoking, and feeling like crap and not have energy for anything. Sick of spending almost 7 bucks every day for stupid cigarettes. Sick of my car smelling like shit and have ashes all over the back seat. 

I had my last cigarette on Wednesday at 11pm. Thursday morning, I threw rest of the pack in garbage along with all of the lighters that I had. I am done with this shit once and for all. 

I tried everything. Patches, gum, e-cig, Allan Carr...everything. Fuck it. I am just stopping cold turkey. I had most success doing it this way before. Get rid of the nicotine in my body and end this addiction. I don't need it anymore. 

I want to be in shape, have energy. I don't want to go outside for a smoke every time I am out with my gf. It smells bad. Sometimes I would get in an elevator with people that just smoked and I think:" Wow, this is what I stink like when I smoke!" It sucks!!!!!!!!

I am done! Who is with me? Any day 2 peeps?

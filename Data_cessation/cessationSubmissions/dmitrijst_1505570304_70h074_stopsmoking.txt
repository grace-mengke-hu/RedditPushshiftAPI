Worst withdrawals??

I quit smoking like 8-9 days ago. I don't have cravings or cough. Smoked for 8 years about half pack a day. Although, had some weird withdrawals like cramps in my back, legs. Lump in my throat. There is more things like strong heartbeat. It causes me anxiety but I think it's getting better. Could tell me your worst withdrawal experiences and how long did they last??

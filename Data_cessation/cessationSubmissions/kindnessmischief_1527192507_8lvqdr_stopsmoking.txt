Memorial Day will be smober! Right‽‽

Hi all! Looking forward to a four day weekend and wondering how you stay smober during party times? Would love to hear your tactics. I’ll be hiking some (no problem there), but also in some boozy party scenes.  I’m committed but ten days and still vulnerable.  Especially in a very social scene. Fairly nervous, tbh.

My tactics are:
- Not having more than one drink (I know myself; others are better at booze and smobriety but I am not!)
- Pop in here if I’m craving and have cell reception
- Use the RAIN method to notice and observe cravings without having to act on them
- Move my body and enjoy my healing lung capacity
- If all else fails, take quiet time away and just honor what I need to not smoke. It’s worth it!

What do you do, /r/stopsmoking?

Last time I quit smoking for 4.5 years, lets see if this time I can go for good.

I'm 26 years old and last time I quit smoking was 4 and a half years ago. I was rather successful, I randomly decided to quit cold-turkey one evening after I got fed up with the habit. I was about at a pack a day then and about that amount now.

I started smoking again "accidentally" even though for whatever reason I was half way debating if I would smoke for this 3 day, 11 hour a day festival/concert over summer.  

The weekend before the show I was on the lake with a bunch of friends having some beers and having a good time.  A friend offered me some SNUS and for whatever reason I bit, I ended up having another, and after that I asked for a hit of my friend's ecig. Within a few hours I was bumming cigarettes.

Of course after the concert I wasn't wanting to quit, I was fine with the habit even though I knew it was ridiculous to throw away quitting for 4.5 years. Well about 9 weeks later I've hit that point.

So here we go again, starting all over from Day 0 which started at about 10PM last night. Wish me luck.

Tomorrow is my quit day; any tips for a hardcore nicotine addict who is trying patches?

I'm using patches because I have tried cold turkey several times and I get physically ill from nicotine withdrawal.  I want to get rid of the behavioral and psychological cues first, then step down off the nicotine.

I'm 35 and have been smoking for 20 years.  I'm absolutely sick of the habit.  It's made dating a hassle because some of the women I want to go out with are disgusted by smokers, and I'm tired of my car and myself smelling like an ashtray, not to mention that whole "paying money to kill myself slowly" aspect.  I'm more motivated to quit now than I have been in my entire life.

Has anyone else had success with the patches under these circumstances?  Thanks for any tips, and wish me luck!

Update: Started early so I could get accustomed to how I feel on the patches while not at work.  3 hours in, and I haven't had any cravings or feelings of withdrawal yet.

Update #2: 20 hours.  Still no cravings, but MAN do I want to eat everything in site. (:

rambling...

20 days in. I don't feel strong. I don't feel like I thought I would.

I'm stressed. I'm looking at buying a house. I'm trying to clean the apartment I'm in now. My husband's depression just went into overdrive last night and I sure as hell didn't help... 

If I smoke it'll just make me more stressed because I'll have to do the hardest parts of this all over again. 

If I smoke it'll just upset my husband (has only had a few in his entire life) more upset. He'll feel like it's partially his fault AND be disappointed. 

If I smoke, I'll need to take a shower and wash my hair like 8 times to get the smell out. I don't even want to think about what my mouth will taste or feel like.

I know that I'm just falling back into "stressed= chain smoke" habits. that it never has and never will make anything easier. 

I know that...

I know that quitting hasn't magically erased all of my stress.

I know that.

I know that I still feel better than I would have in this situation if I were smoking. I can breathe better, I'm not wasting my time outside smoking, I'm not kicking myself for every hit. 

I know this is normal stress and I need to get over it and deal with it like everybody else. 

Smoking will not clean my apartment.

Smoking will not help me clean faster.

Smoking will not make houses that I like magically appear on the market within my price range.

And smoking sure as hell wont make me able to afford more. 

If you're still reading, thanks for letting me vent to you. 

I feel better.

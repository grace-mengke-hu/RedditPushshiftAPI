smoking cessation and major depression?

Hello, I quit smoking about a week ago, and I'm feeling fine right now. Quitting permanently seems like an easily attainable goal. But I know that as soon as I hit my next depressive state, it is going to be a different story. I legitimately feel like cigarettes help during times like that, and that has interrupted previous attempts at quitting. Smoking is just the only way that I know to process thought in a certain way that lets me work through all the irrationality. 

I know that I can fend it off for a few days, but weeks or even months seems like it would make me go crazy.

What do you do as a replacement for smoking when in depressive periods? I've thought about writing instead, but writing doesn't really hit the spot for me like smoking. 

I've also thought about maybe getting a hookah so that I can get close to the act of smoking without actually smoking a cigarette. (I am more of a cigarette addict than a nicotine addict). 

edit: For clarity, by 'major' I mean 'clinical'

16 year old here, been smoking since I was 12.

I really don't want to stop, but I need to. I only started because school and the other kids were so harsh on me at first, it cured my stress, it got me into hanging out the smokers at school and those friends taught me how to behave and not be socially awkward and stuff, sort of changed the way I am entirely; haven't been bullied since, been to a lot of parties, got a lot of new friends, popular etc...

But I feel like it's time to stop before I become that smoker who coughs up asphalt, care to give some advice?

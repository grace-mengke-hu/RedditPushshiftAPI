Suggestions wanted please

Hello, Day 1 again for me in trying to quit cigs. I only smoke when I drink. I'm trying to curb this habit though. I've downloaded the "QuitNow" app for some positive reinforcement in regards to health benefits and how much money I've saved so far ($31.00AUD for a pack of 26 smokes - yes, its ridiculously expensive in Australia) However, I'm after any advice when the urge rises. Also any good books to read or documentaries to watch. Thanks in advance :)

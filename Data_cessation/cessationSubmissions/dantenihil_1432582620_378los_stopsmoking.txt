Cold Turkey

  So, this will be my ultimately be my 4th/5th time that I have stopped smoking.  But seriously for the last time.  Each time I do it, I do it cold turkey with no issues.  A few months to a year at a time.  But I work a highly stressful job and everyone knows hows smoking just helps with that.  Add smoking to your stress, your heart will but fine.  Not to mention I work a job that requires me to be physically fit.
  So all in all smoking is just a bad deal.  I hated doing it in the first place but just missed the familiarity of it I guess?  Who knows why we relapse.
  This time though I went 4 days, got stressed out and "smoked" two cigarettes.  I quote smoked because it was really about half of each and it just tasted disgusting.  But the day after I was extraordinarily busy so I couldn't (didn't want to) smoke so it was easy to get back on track.
  Here I am today going cold again 17 days later with zero issues.  I work around a bunch of smokers and I just realize that 1) the people around that smoke, I want to be nothing like 2) I chose a higher level of physical fitness over, well, counter-fitness.
  So thats my rant, thanks to all that read I appreciate it.  To whom it may concern, yes I changed my badge so it will reflect shorty.

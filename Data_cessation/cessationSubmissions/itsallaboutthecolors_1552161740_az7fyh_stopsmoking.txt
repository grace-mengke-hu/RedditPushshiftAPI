5 days and feeling great!

I haven’t smoked for 5 full days and I feel amazing now :) the weird thing is that I never liked spicy food and I love it now, I’ve just added crushed chillies to nuts and loads of wasabi to my sushi... did this happen to anyone else? Like I’ve never eaten spicy foods, I used to hate them ...

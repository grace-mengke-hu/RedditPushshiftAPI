Attempt Number...*sigh*...Who Knows

Well, here I am again, throwing down a gauntlet I wish I didn't have to throw down. A habit I both love, and hate. Something that is killing me, and limiting my life options, but is, I hate to admit it, part of my identify.  

As I cast back in my memory, all my personal milestones, have been accompanied by a 'victory,' smoke. Everyday activities wrapped with that blue haze. The confort, the calming hand, the cavalier life choice, turned in to a dependance. 

Well, I have everything to life for now. And something has to change. So, I told my wife I would quit on Sunday...And now it is Sunday, and I have a glass of water at hand, and riding out each craving, like a boat in a storm.

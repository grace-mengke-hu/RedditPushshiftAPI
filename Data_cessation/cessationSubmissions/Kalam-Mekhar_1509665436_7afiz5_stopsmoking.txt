Third times the charm?

I just wanted to stop by and say hello to everyone here. I've been a smoker for ten years, I quit for four months last year because my partner hated it and I had a relapse when she went away for a couple months due to school. I managed to quit again but it only lasted for a few weeks and I was back to smoking in secret, mostly at work. We broke up about a month ago and I'm finally at a place in my life where I want to quit for me. Sunday is the day. I know it's going to be difficult but this time, it's because it's what I want and I'm hoping that will be the difference.

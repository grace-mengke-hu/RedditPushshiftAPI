So I'm actually doing it!

A month or two ago I posted here wanting to quit, I had the desire to quit but wasn't planning on actually going through with it. But that changed. I recently got sick and have bronchitis the past couple of days and haven't smoke a cigarette since I've been sick so I thought, why not just do it for good? So I'm giving it a shot! 3 days strong now, lets keep it going!

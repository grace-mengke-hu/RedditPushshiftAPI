What the hell is that smell?

Ok that was... interesting. 

Was sitting here browsing reddit when this subtle smell started to linger around me. It seriously started to smell like i had my nose in my shoe , which in my opinion ( as far as I know anyway ) had no odor. I had my feet crossed in my chair, and wearing socks. I've done this probably thousands of times unconsciously.  I soon realized , though, that this was the source. 

Tip for newly non-smokers: take your socks off while browsing or wear a fresh pair!

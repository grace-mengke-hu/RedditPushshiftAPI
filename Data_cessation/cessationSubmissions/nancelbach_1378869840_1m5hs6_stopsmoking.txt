Today is Tuesday, Day 11....

Today was hard.  Harder than yesterday and that sucks.  I've been doing well.  Quit smoking and picked up walking.  I walk to work, I walk to get beer, I walk at lunch, I walk everywhere.  But there is something looming.  A moment that I can't escape where I feel like I might smoke a cigarette at any time.  It's hard.  It feels hard.  I don't want to smoke.  I have my mantra.  But it's on my mind.  ALWAYS.  And today it feels worse.  I hoped it might be better but it's worse.  All I can hope that is that tomorrow will be better because no matter how bad it was today, I MADE IT THROUGH!

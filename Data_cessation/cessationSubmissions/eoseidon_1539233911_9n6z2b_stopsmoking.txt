1 in the morning and I’m fully awake

This insomnia is serious. It has been 52 hours since the last time I smoked Marijuana, and I’ve started to get my appetite as well as focus back, but the insomnia has been severe. I barely got more than 4 hours of sleep last night and I doubt I will get more than 4 tonight. Safe to say I will be one grumpy person tomorrow. Any advice on how to get rid of this insomnia?

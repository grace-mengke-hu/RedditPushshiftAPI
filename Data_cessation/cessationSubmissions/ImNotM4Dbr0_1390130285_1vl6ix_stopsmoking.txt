Welp 1 week, next stop the rest of my life.

More energy to do stupid stuff and less shortness of breath while doing it. I am coughing a lot but I guess that will be gone in time? I can't wait for the weather to get warmer because working out in home doesen't quite cut it. Never felt so good in my life.

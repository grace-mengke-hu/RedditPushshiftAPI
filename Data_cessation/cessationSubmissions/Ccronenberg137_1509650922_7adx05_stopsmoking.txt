Day 34

Its been 34 days since I quit cold turkey and there's a pretty odd, loud, and im assuming drunk woman pretty much blowing smoke in my face. And im finding the smell grotesque. Any other day I'd be pissed off beyond belief, but today I'm kinda happy that I don't find the smell inviting. I just wanted to share that. Quitting smoking has made me more tolerant.

Fun with a pack of smokes

I bought a pack tonight at a c-store.  (I was there for other items.)  Got to my car. Looked at it.  Opened window.  Looked at snowbank.

The whole pack is in the snowbank somewhere.  I didn't open it and I didn't smoke a single one.

Hey, it's $11 down the drain, but it's also me not smoking.  I'll cough up the $11.

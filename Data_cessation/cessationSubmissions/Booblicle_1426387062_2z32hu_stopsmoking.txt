Holy Smokes!

No real reason to post but had an interesting experience today...

As a long time smoker, I sometimes used to smoke a pipe, for it's aroma and taste. And there is a wide selection to chose from. And I believe it was cheaper - at least when I was still smoking. But it was also rough on the tongue and it was rough resisting inhaling the smoke ( an effect of cigarettes. ) Anyway. pipe smokers are pretty infrequent. Even here, where smokers are everywhere. So I was totally unprepared when I smelled a pipe.(or cigar(?)) It was VERY aromatic. I mean, ok sure, that chicken across the street is pretty appealing these days but OMG. That pipe, wherever it was, was incredibly strong. Incredibly aromatic and incredibly sweet smelling. No, I didn't want a cigarette, or a pipe for that matter. But I never realized just how freaking strong they are.

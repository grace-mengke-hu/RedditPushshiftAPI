I'm in

Hi /r/stopsmoking. I'm a 27 year old, who has smoked more than enough and I'm ready to kick it. I've downloaded the QuitSmoking app, and set my quit date to this afternoon. It's my hope that I just had my last cigarette. It wasn't romantic - I was smoking and walking in the rain for the umpteenth time because I can't smoke in my apartment. 

I've had some reservations about making this post. I'm a recently sober alcoholic, and I'm nervous that if I take my remaining vice away I'll be closer to going back to drinking. That said, I've followed the steps and suggestions of a 12 step group and I'm feeling pretty good about my sobriety. Not complacent; not even 100% confident; but comfortable. Are there any sober alcoholics here who struggled with their sobriety after they quit? I made a post in /r/stopdrinking about this (http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2uyixy/smoking_risking_sobriety/) and received a bit of helpful feedback, but I'm certainly open to more. 

I believe my biggest challenge will be around 12 step meetings and at work - most of my pals outside of my sobriety program (and many in it) don't smoke, and I don't smoke much at home either.

edit: I forgot that I turned 27, heh. Thanks for reading

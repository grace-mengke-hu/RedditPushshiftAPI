How much time passes before you become an "ex-smoker"?

I smoked 20 cigarettes per day, 365 days per year for 16 years. That's 116,800 cigarettes. 

I haven't had a single one since Saturday. Instead, it's been six days full of nicorette gum and cinnamon sticks.

I don't feel like I've "quit" yet -- I would not yet describe myself as an "ex-smoker." 

How do others feel about this? At what point did you start self-identifying as an "ex-smoker"? A week? A month? A year?

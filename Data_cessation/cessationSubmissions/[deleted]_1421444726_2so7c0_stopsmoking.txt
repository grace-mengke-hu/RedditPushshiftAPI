4 days deep...

So this is not my first time "quitting" by any means but i sure hope its the last. Historically it's been someone else pushing me to quit i.e. girlfriend and/ or family. This time it is 100% me. I wanted to quit for new years but i already had a trip to vegas planned last weekend. I knew putting me in that situation would probably make me fail, which is almost worst that smoking to begin with. That feeling of defeat. Anyways i quit the day i got back from vegas and haven't smoke since. The cravings up until this point haven't been to difficult, but I just in general feel like shit. Sort of have a bit of a cold which is pissing me off. I quit smoking last year for about 2 months and was going to the gym regularly and then started smoking again in addition to not going to the gym anymore. I now want to go back to the gym and start exercising again regularly but I have read a few places that maybe I should just take it easy until this withdrawal sickness passes.. Any recommendations or words of wisdom for any of my issues?

Anyone else feel less fit, particularly with airflow, sinuses and gunk, after quitting?

I've been smoking for ten years now, and after managing to cut it down to weekends only (for the most part) over the last year I've finally quit totally with the patch since the 26th Feb. My problem is post-quitting I've had continuous sinus congestion and low level coughing up of clear, sticky, gunky mucus. I know this is apparently a common symptom but it's actually gotten to the point where I feel that my lung capacity is worse than when I was smoking; I find I just can't pull the air through my nose or throat into my lungs enough. I'm not planning to go back to cigarettes anytime, it'd just be great support if anyone else had experienced this and could tell me it does get better eventually :(

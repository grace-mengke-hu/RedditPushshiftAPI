Fuck Smoking (DAY 1)

I have had it with this shit. I keep quitting for a few months then falling in the trap again. This is the final straw. 

Every time I start smoking I start eating like shit, not exercising and feeling terrible about myself and everything. 

Day 1 almost done. Weekdays will be more challenging but I am sure I'll get through it.

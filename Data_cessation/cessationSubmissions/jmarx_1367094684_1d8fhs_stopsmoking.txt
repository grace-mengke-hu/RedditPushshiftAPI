Do I need to go to a doctor?

I'm 18 years old and I've been smoking for a year now. I already have a history of weak lungs. But I smoke about 15-20 a day. I've had a recurring chest cough for nearly a month and a half now. At this point its gotten so bad that this is what it looks like when I cough into the sink. Should I go to a doctor?

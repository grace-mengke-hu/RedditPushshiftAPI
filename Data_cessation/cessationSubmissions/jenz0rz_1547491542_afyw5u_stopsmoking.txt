one week down!!

today i hit one whole week without cigarettes!!!! 


ive been smoking about 3/4 of a pack a day for 6 years. never thought it would be this easy to quit! i downloaded a stop smoking app on my phone the first day and it taught me the mantra, “not another puff, no matter what” 

etching that thought in my brain has made everything so much easier 

cheers to all the others embarking on this journey. stay happy and healthy my dudes!!!

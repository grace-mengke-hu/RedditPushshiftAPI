How do I make myself feel better?

So, I’ve only been smoke free for a few days. I’ve been on and off using a e-cig &amp; a few nicotine gums. 

I feel absolutely destroyed. I feel zoned out &amp; instantly get angry at anything. 

Is it best to just battle through without using any NRT or not? How has other people got through these beginning hell days?

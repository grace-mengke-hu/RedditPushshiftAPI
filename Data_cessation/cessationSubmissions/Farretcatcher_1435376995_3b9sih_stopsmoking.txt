Introduction, Hi I'm Farretcatcher and I haven't quit yet but I really want to.

I guess I'll say a little about myself, I started smoking at a very young age, like, no younger than 12, but no older than 14. I am now a 20-something mother and all smoking has brought me is guilt. 

The worst thing is I didn't quit while I was pregnant. I tried,and on the third day at the very end of the day I caved and had one. I regret it, I even still fear that my son has and will suffer because of it, like he's just going to fall over dead one day because of me. 

I really want to quit, every now and then I will light up and think of how gross it tastes, or how bad it smells, or even me passing away and leaving my son behind because I was too stubborn to quit. 

I feel hopeless, like I have no fight left in me. I feel unbelievably stressed out because on top of all the actual life things I have weighing down on me I have this nasty habit that could kill me putting more pressure on the stress part of my life.

I know I need help. I don't know where to begin. 

There's still this big part of me that doesn't want to quit too.

How do I overcome this?

But at least I don't want to smoke....

Shit day. I can't even explain what's wrong except I specifically asked for San Pellegrino Sparkling Lemonade and Jordan's Natural cereal and my husband bought me Diet Sprite and Special K. He may as well have called me fat. Not a big deal, I've just been in a funk all day. I fall into the normal BMI range. As you can see, I'm feeling defensive. I'd like a little more support from him and I'm not getting it, in general I mean, not in food stuffs. And I've got a huge case of the Fuck Yous. *You're not going to support me, fine two can play that game.* I'm a fucking terrible wife because I have a super genius husband that can't do everyday normal people things without my support. And I'm not up to it. 
TL;DR I'm a bitch; I didn't smoke

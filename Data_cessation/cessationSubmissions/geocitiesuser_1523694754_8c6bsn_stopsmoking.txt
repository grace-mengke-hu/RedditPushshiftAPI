7 days, the insomnia is ruining my life.

It's 4:30 am and the third night of insomnia since quitting. I've had to take time off from work because i was so underslept i didn't feel comfortable driving. Now my weekend will basically be ruined as well because im so underslept I can't enjoy Saturday.

No point to this post but whining. Even with sleeping pills (melatonin, over the counter) all i can do is lay with my eyes closed but never reach sleep. Torture!

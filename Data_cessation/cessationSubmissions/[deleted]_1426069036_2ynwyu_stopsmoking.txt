I need a pat on the back.

I've been tobacco free since Friday. This is huge for me, I've talked about quitting for years but never made it more than one day without bumming a smoke of someone or just having a pull before resigning myself to buying a pack.

I don't know why I decided this is the best time to quit because me life is crazy right now but it's the first time it's felt real. At the moment, work is more stressful than usual and will be until the end of the month, there is a lot going on, I can handle that. The house I'm renting/sharing is under construction at the moment so I'm coming home from a full days work and having to move furniture or lend a hand painting. This will probably be for the next two months and I can handle that too. What I can't handle is everyone telling me I should 'just' have a smoke!!!!!
Seriously, I've had four people tell me I should just have one to curb the craving, having one won't make a difference, I should have one to 'ease myself into it', not a single person so far has said 'oh that's awesome, stay strong!' or keep going. At this point I can't tell if I'm irritable because of a nicotine craving or because everyone around me seems to want me fail.

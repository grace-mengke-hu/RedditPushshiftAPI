I figured out why my plants kept dying

I was just spacing out on this odd leaf growing on one of my house plants just now because it's an odd half/half of green and lighter green with dark green spots on it while every other leaf that's ever grown on that plant has always been just dark green fully... 

Anyway, I noticed a lot of new growth and no dead leaves on any of my plants since I've moved into my new house in December when before they had been dying.  I've lost a few plants already...  I felt like this was nothing short of a miracle since I'm usually cursed with the Murphy's Law concept and have had a really hard time keeping any house plants alive, ever.  I constantly get shit about it from my SO and brother.

The only thing that's changed between then and now is that I don't smoke in the house anymore (and now, I don't smoke at all :)).  They were not only killing me, but killing them too!  I'm so happy to feel like everything I touch *doesn't* die. 

**TL;DR:  I don't smoke in my house anymore and my plants aren't dying anymore, even starting to grow now.**

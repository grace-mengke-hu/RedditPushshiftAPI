A week in and I'm ready to give up again because of confidence issues and verbal abuse.

Being verbally/emotionally abused for years has a way of making one feel worthless and incapable of doing anything good for themselves. It makes me want to quit trying to be a better person, because what's the point?? I must really be awful for someone to say such things about me and treat me so poorly, right??
  
  
Please share your stories of how you built your self worth up as you were learning to treat yourself with respect and quit smoking. For those of you who are also struggling with being emotionally abused by parents, spouses, relatives or even people at your workplace: you have my sympathy and you are not alone.

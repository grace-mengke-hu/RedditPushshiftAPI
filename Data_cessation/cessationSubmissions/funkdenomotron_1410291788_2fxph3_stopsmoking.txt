Funk Checking In. Day 10 and all is well!

Howdy!



No significant cravings since about day 2. Have dealt with some constipation, but nothing major. Probably gained a lb or 2, I don't care. 



My business weasel sure seems to be much more....ready for business; A weak breeze brushes by and I am harder than trigonometry. 



Something odd happened this morning, I woke up to a little bit of drool. Strange because when smoking I woke up with an entirely dry mouth and tongue, which was not pleasant. Probably really bad for the ivory as well. 



Coworker asked me how I am keeping the hand and mouth fixation in check, and realized I must have totally skipped that part. I kept a deck of cards on me JIC, but never needed them. I know many people do the whole carrot stick/lolly pop/other thing thing, not sure how I skipped it. I play musical instruments, and was bottle fed......yeah that must be it. 



DOWNSIDE to quitting! Shit beer really tastes like shit now lol.



Get there and keep it up!

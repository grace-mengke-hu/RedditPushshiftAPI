Ready to throw in the towel

So today has been a day from hell. Went to work, I’m a teacher of tiny humans. These past 3 days were supposed to be for trainings and getting our rooms in order. Out of the 3 days, we got a total of 8 hours. Now, the rest was sitting in a cafeteria listening to someone go on and on and on. Not really learning nothing new, maybe others are, but I go to trainings regularly, including over the summer. These beginning of year “trainings” like today, are just condensed versions of all of the ones I’ve went to. That’s the first thing, the fact that I have 54 kids coming tomorrow and shit is everywhere🤬. Then, I always try to be the fucking team player so spent the last 2wks of my break making decorations and doing all these extra things that was asked of me. Gave them to the person in charge and some kind of way, it all ended up on the floors and scattered all around the damn building, two stories y’all. Like I dedicated 2 fucking weeks of my life to make something to make our school look nice and it’s thrown around all over the fucking place like who give a fuck. At my lunch, I almost went and bought a pack. The store is across the street. There’s actually two. One across the highway and one across the street from school. I’m sitting here crying right now cause I want one that bad even though I know it’d be completely stupid as I’m working my way through day 17 right now. I just need it to get easier. Work will never get easier. I’m in an area that we have too many kids in a class with barely any support (including basic stuff like texts) from the district. I need to not wnt to smoke.

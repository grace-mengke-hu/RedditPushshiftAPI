Almost 2 hours in.

[This video] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urwxeZf9jmA&feature=youtu.be) inspired me to quit today. I did not plan this in advance, I did not set a quit date. I just made a decision and smoked my last one while I watched that video.

The first of what I'm sure are going to be many cravings have started creeping in. I'm writing down my strategy so I can remember what I'm thinking now in the future and leaving this as a reminder to myself.

1. Cravings don't mean "I want a cigarette". They indicate that I'm going through withdrawal from a powerful and deadly drug. Cool then. Bring on the cravings. It means I'm winning this battle. I'm successfully starving the little bastard asshole that nicotine addiction is.

2. When I'm hit by a serious craving, I'm going to do repetitions of something positive 24 times (24 because that's how many years I've been a smoker) It can be 24 breaths, 24 sips of green tea or water, 24 sit ups, push ups, curls, etc., putting 24 things where they belong. While I do that thing 24 times, I will practice mindfulness, giving that action my full attention.

3. By redirecting my thoughts to associate the feeling of "needing a cigarette" to replace it with "a reminder to do something healthy and productive" I will hopefully retrain myself to think differently about the experience and start seeing the craving as a motivator, not a temptation.

Anyway, that's all I've got so far, but my green tea is ready and I'm feeling like getting a good dose of antioxidants.

Edit: **20 hours in**. So far so good. Rough patches being smoothed over with breathing, water and/or exercise. Realizing that I don't know the difference between "I'm hungry" and "I'm having an addiction-related craving for something to fill this void." For that reason, I'm being really careful not to start snacking to get me through this. Just deeper breathing, hydration with water or green tea (adding honey when I have green tea for a blood sugar boost) and/or exercise. Being a non-smoker does not have to mean gaining a lot of weight. I'm determined to be healthier as a result of this instead of just trading off vices. *So far, triggers for cravings have been: after meals, first thing in the morning, while having coffee (not adding sugar to it helped for w/e reason), and when getting mad/upset about something.*

Edit 2: **@the 24 hour mark.** Made it to day 2 of being a non-smoker, even though my badge doesn't say so yet. Hit the 24 hour about 40 minutes ago, and I'm already looking forward to not caring how many days it's been. I couldn't tell you how many days it's been since I got over the flu. Know why? It's a non-issue. 

Edit 3:**Approaching the 44 hour mark**. Waking up and then not going out  for that first one is still weird. I'm not giving up coffee, too, but for now, I'm not putting sugar in it. Sugar seems to trigger cravings. Yesterday I kept up with calories (which I normally don't) and even with my extra snacking I'm under  2000 so hopefully massive weight gain won't be an issue. Also realized by chance that the day I saw the Allen Carr video and decided to quit was my 777th day of sobriety. I had no idea at the time, but this sub had a link to stopdrinking, which I did 2 years ago, and when I asked for a badge there, that's what it said. Thought that was kind of cool/synchronistic/random... [43 hours in. Just walked/jogged 1/2 mile to fight cravings. Haven't been able to do that without getting winded in ages.]

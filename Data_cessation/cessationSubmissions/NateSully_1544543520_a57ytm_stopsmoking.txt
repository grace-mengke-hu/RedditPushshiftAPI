Doing it all over again...

I quit smoking in June of 2017 cold turkey and was good until about August of this year. I went to a military training which lead me to missing my time in the smoke pit just talking to everyone about anything and everything. I picked up a juul just for almost nostalgic purposes, but also not wanting to smoke cigarettes. Thinking it would be fine and would be a quick and easy thing to kick again. 

However, it did exactly the opposite and brought my nicotine addiction back in full effect and probably even worse. I tried to keep it on the DL because I was pretty ashamed of myself for being so naive and silly. I decided to get rid of it after a few months and have been smoking 1/4 to 1/2 a pack a day in secret. Constantly washing my hands and face and brushing my teeth to get rid of any hint of the smell. Today starts the day that I cut the shit and get myself back to where I was because I felt so damn good, and now I feel like crap again. 

Seeing all your posts and kind words to others helps. Cheers.

Day 5

It feels so strange not having a box in my left pocket. My lips have gone dry and my gums are a bit sore, so I've been drinking loads of water to keep hydrated. I'm hungry all the time but the cravings are not too bad. I coughed up blood on Friday and got a fright so I said fuck it, time to quit. But I'm finding it hard to get to sleep so that's annoying.

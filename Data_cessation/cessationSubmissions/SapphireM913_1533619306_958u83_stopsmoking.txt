The Suck has begun. I really hate The Suck...

I'm finishing Day 6. Patches and lozenges, lots of rewards (daily pictures of my 1.5 yr old nephew!), and the actual physical cravings have been manageable. But The Suck has begun.

Best piece of advice I got last time was "Google 'Embrace The Suck'". I did so, I agree with the premise, I believe in the theory. But fuuuuuuck it lives up to it's name. For all the triumphs (which I acknowledge and celebrate), for all the benefits (which I recognize and am happy with), for all the rewards, The Suck can just eat a dick.

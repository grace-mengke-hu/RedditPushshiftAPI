3 years smoke free today!

And that's nicotine free and everything! 
3 years ago today I took my last puff. I wasn't planning on it being my last cigarette either as I had planned to buy some more later. However, the guilt was weighing on me with each passing cig and finally I just broke and quit cold turkey right then and there. I work in a hospital and I was seeing patients with trachs and COPD and starting asking myself "Why do I think that won't be me if i continue to smoke?". Also, I was 26, and started at 13, and a friend pointed out to me that I was smoking half of my life. That was a sobering thought. 

How I did it:
 I called everyone close to me and declared that I was quitting. I went to the grocery store and bought $30 worth of all my favorite candies (caramels, jolly ranchers), the increased sugar temporarily outweighed the risks of smoking. I washed all my clothes, threw out all my matches, ash trays, lighters. I cleaned my car so it wouldnt be covered in ashes. Most importantly I envisioned myself as a non-smoker, and told myself that I can be someone who quits too. I took it an hour at a time, and then a day at a time. I started cycling my very first day of quitting (exercise helps with withdrawal they said) and now 3 years later I'm super in to fitness and can deadlift 435 lbs and squat 355 at 170lb (77 kg) bodyweight :)

What I do is no longer dictated by a cigarette and Im so proud to be free. I was tired of taking frequent breaks at work or when I was out to friends to do something I didn't even really benefit from. I'm so proud of being an ex smoker, and if you're thinking about quitting, hopefully one day you can say the same :) 

good luck everyone, you can do this, one craving at a time

Cleaned out my car today and was really disappointed in myself.

Long time lurker of the subreddit but just want to make a post about a recent slip up I had. I quit smoking for about 6 months after being a pack a day smoker for the past 10 years and it felt great. No longer did I smell like smoke, craved or worried about when my next cigarette would be, could finally smell things and my taste returned, etc etc. Well about 4 months ago I decided for some dumb reason to buy a pack of cigarettes. Then the streak was over. Before I knew it I was back again to smoking a pack a day. I quit again last weekend and though it's been a struggle I feel a lot better. Tonight I had enough spare time to clean my car and man was I just disappointed in myself for how I've been living the past few months. I have a nasty habit of not throwing away cigarette boxes when I'm finished with them for some reason so as you can imagine my car was littered with empty boxes of cigarettes accompanied with ashes all over the interior of my car. No joke there had to be 30+ empty packs of cigs; they were in my center console, in plastic bags, on the floor of the passenger seat, and in the little pocket of my car door (don't know the proper name of it). I also threw away the water bottle ashtray I had sitting in my cup holder which was also disgusting. I'm done with this addiction and will gladly take the cravings I get everyday than to go back to smoking cigs all the time. It's no way to live. Didn't mean to ramble on so much but keep strong everybody! You can beat this addiction.

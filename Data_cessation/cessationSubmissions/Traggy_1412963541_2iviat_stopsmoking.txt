100 Days! Some tips that helped me.

- Slow breathing when having a craving.
- avoiding caffeine and drinking for the first month
- Committing to quitting
- Deal with stress head on and repeating that a cigarette doesn't make stress go away when a craving hits at those times.
- Exercise
- Don't for a second think that one puff won't hurt anything.


So far so good!  This is my best attempt yet and I know that I have it beat at this point.  Never smoke again.

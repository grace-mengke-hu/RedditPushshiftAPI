Struggling with stress.

For the last 9 years whenever something stressful happened I would have a smoke and though the actual situation didn't change I would feel better. Now I've decided to quit for various reasons (aunt dying of lung cancer and money being main motivators). I don't know how to deal with the stress of everyday life anymore. I started smoking at such a crucial time of my life that I don't think I ever learned how to properly deal with stress. It's like those teenagers who ace their way through highschool without trying and then fail at post-sec because they never developed any study habits. 

I feel like I'm failing even though I haven't smoked in 4 days and that should feel like an accomplishment.

Advice would be very nice right now.

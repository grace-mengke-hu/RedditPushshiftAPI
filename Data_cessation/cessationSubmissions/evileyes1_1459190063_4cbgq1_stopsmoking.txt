1 months and 11 days

Haven't smoked in long now, and it feels good. I like something not having power over me.

But...

I literally cannot stop thinking about it.. And somewhere deep down I keep wondering whether it's worth it if I never stop thinking about it? I'm not tempted as such, I don't feel a craving or anything of that sort but I just can't stop thinking about it. Is this common?

Was a half a pack day smoker for 8 years.

Any advise?

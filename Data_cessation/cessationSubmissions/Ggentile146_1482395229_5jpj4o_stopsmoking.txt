30 days cold turkey!

It's been 30 days cold turkey and I gotta say it's had its ups and downs. The bad parts of it weren't wanting a cigarette it was the mental health part. I would have anxiety and depression attacks points really bad. Idk if it was because I stayed in the house a lot but damn it sucked. I've been getting out of the house more and it's been getting better. I hardly have cravings but it's probably because I'm to worried about having another episode of anxiety/depression. I quit because of anxiety and it was great for the first week and then it started coming back. Now it's starting to subside again. I quite years ago because of anxiety and after 8 months without a cigarette my anxiety was completely gone. Then when I started smoking again it slowly came back. I swear cigarettes play a big role in anxiety and panic attacks. Anyways, I hope my brain snaps back to normal in the near future and starts functioning properly again. Good luck to all you trying to quit and just remember to take it 1 day at a time. Stay strong and happy holidays!!!

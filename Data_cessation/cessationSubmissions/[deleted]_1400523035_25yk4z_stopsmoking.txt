When you quit, what was your state of mind?

By which I mean, did you just feel "ready"? Can you recall just exactly how you felt? Did you quit in the middle of a pack or even a cigarette?


 I'm struggling with this, and have failed within hours (<4) multiple times. The farthest I've gotten has been 4. There was a point a month ago I didn't smoke for two days, but I was vaping with 12mg juice so I don't think that counts. 

Any input is helpful!

Edit** thank you for all of the feedback. Also, I have read allen's book a couple months ago, and it did make me more determined. Maybe I need to give it another read.

Holy hell, the rush of angst going on day three.

I hadn't realized that by smoking on the weekends and having a few a day made me so dependent on nicotine. I am antsy and generally pissed off because of it. I've heard quiting turns you into an ass, but hell, just about everything I want to tell "go fuck yourself" 

Im biking and focusing on diet, which helps but what other methods of relaxation have you all found to ease this asshole state of mind?

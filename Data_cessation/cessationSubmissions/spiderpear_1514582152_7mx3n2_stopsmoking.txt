What withdrawal symptoms to expect when quitting smoking with the patch?

This is my second time seriously attempting to quit smoking.  The last time I quit for a little under a year going cold turkey.  This time I want to try using the patch.  I have smoked for about 10 years, and am currently smoking around 17 cigarettes a day.

When I quit cold turkey, I had to work through many intense cravings and intense emotions for the first few months.  During the first week I stayed with a family member to separate myself from my usual routine.

I’m curious what withdrawal looks like while using the patch.  Physical symptoms, emotional symptoms, craving frequency/intensity, weight gain, energy levels?  I can’t find much information online about what withdrawal looks like while using the patch.  

I imagine (but could be wrong) that the patch takes some of the cravings away, but there’s still a huge psychological and habitual piece to deal with, so what did navigating that look like for you?

Also, any advice for using the patch to quit is welcome.

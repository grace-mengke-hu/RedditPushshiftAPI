Help related to health issues

Hello Reddit,

This post is wrt a health related issue caused by smoking. Please do let me know if this is the wrong sub for it. 

I am 25 years old. I have been smoking for about 3 years. I had quit for about six months but restarted (Jan - July 2017)

In October of 2018 I was smoking about 10 cigs a day. Since then I have had a pain in my chest right in the sternum. And a constant congestion and pain in the throat. This had never happened before and I drastically cut my smoking in the next month. I have tried to quit since without success. 

The chest and throat pain continue to this day and is aggravated when I smoke. I usually smoke when I drink so on weekends mostly now. But the pain never goes away. 

In January 2019, I have visited an ENT doctor - since I was suspecting an underlying condition (yes throat cancer). He did a preliminary examination and hold me that everything was clear and told me to quit. 

However like I stated I have failed. I managed to quit for 20 days then smoked at a party again. 

Additionally I was diagnosed with leukemia in 2009, but since then I have undergone a successful transplant. I'm really really scared of getting any kind of cancer again. I know it sounds ridiculous for a cancer survivor to smoke and to lay to waste all the hardships my family underwent during my treatment but I fucked up. Please do not judge me for my habit. 

I wanted to know if any of you have had same issues and how did you go about it and the seriousness of the same.

What steps should I take before quitting for good?

I'm 22 years old and have been smoking for 11 years. It got to about a pack a day about 6 years ago. Sometimes, if I'm stuck in the house I can go through 40. My parents have always smoked, kids in care smoked, I figured it was the thing to do when you're stressed. Got hooked quickly.

I have my own house, but I now have my mum living with me as she has cancer. She's also an alcoholic and can be abusive. My boyfriend has moved country for work, and since I can't get out a lot I find myself sitting in the house chain smoking, or walking the dogs to a near by hill and chain smoking. I've had depression and (worse) anxiety since I was about 15. 

I feel so trapped by cigarettes. Sometimes I get off them for a bit, but the anxiety, mad mood swings and anger get the better of me. I have bills to pay and a mother to care for. I get no release from stress other than walking my dogs. I begin to feel my jaw clench in work (we're not allowed to smoke in our uniforms) and on the way home. I don't seem to want them when I'm cleaning, shopping or at work, but once I'm sitting down for the night I chain smoke.

I'd really like to know what steps I should take to free myself from paper and leaves (really that's all they are and it's pathetic I'm this dependent). I can't remember a time I didn't smoke. I'd really appreciate any advice as although I'm fit and I exercise, every morning starts with coughing up phlegm. Thank you.

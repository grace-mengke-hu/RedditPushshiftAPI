I quit

After reading the posts here I found the inspiration to quit. I am 23 and I have been smoking since I was 15 on and off. I had quit a few months back and had been clean for nearly 3 months i gave in to the urge of smoking one and was back to smoking again in no time. This time I have decide I will not take another puff. Help me stay strong. Today is a new start.

How do I drink and not crave a cig? Any advice welcome!

Hey stopsmoking fam! I have finally made it to a week, and I honestly couldn't be more proud of myself. I was a 10-15 cig smoker a day, but I quit this time last week using the patches and gum (which I honestly couldn't recommend enough). My question for everyone is, how was the first time being in a social/drinking setting as a non smoker? I had some mates around last night for drinks (a lot of them are smokers), and I didn't trust myself to drink because I was worried I would crave a cigarette. So I didn't even touch wine (which was hard not drinking AND smoking). Although I have a 30th tomorrow night, and I was hoping to have a few drinks without caving and having a cig.

Any advice for the first time drinking wine as a non smoker? I feel like this is going to be the real test!

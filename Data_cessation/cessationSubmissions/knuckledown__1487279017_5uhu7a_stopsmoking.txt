How to get through day one?

I smoked a cigarette about five minutes ago. Well, half, really. Halfway through, I realized that I didn't want that cigarette as badly as I'd thought so I threw it out. I've been smoking for over 20 years. It is 4 p.m., EST. How do I get through the rest of the evening without succumbing to a craving that I'm sure to get?

Thank you - and great job to all of those who are smoke free! Keep it up! I can't wait to join your ranks.

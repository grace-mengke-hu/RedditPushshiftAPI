Flushed my cigarettes down the toilet

25 cigarettes down the tubes.  I have none left.  In fact this week I have probably wasted close to $50 on smokes I flushed down the toilet.  

I don't want to keep playing this game.  Quitting, relapsing, quitting, relapsing.  Throwing away money.  Burning my lungs.  I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired.  Its been 7 hours without a cigarette.  I don't care how bad it gets, how bad I feel, I will not smoke another cigarette again. 

I'm glad to join you guys on this journey.

Never quit trying to quit.  I've gotten to the point now where I am mad at smoking.  So mad that every slip I go right back to trying to quit.  I refuse to be a smoker anymore

I will make this my last quit

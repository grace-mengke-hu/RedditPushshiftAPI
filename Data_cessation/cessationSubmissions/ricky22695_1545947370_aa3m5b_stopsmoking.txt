Went jogging to the groceries and then came back!

Hi there! Proud of myself. After only 42 hours deep, I had to go to the groceries and decided to jog on my way there and nearly bought a pack. I had my nicotine vaporiser and when the cashier asked me: 'That's all?' I nearly asked for a pack but I took three pushes of my nicotine vaporiser and held tight. I packed my stuff and went on my way jogging back home. I am really super proud of myself but also, out of breath! I am super proud I held my ground against cigarettes, I have not been able to jog for such a long time in many many years. Now I know I can do it. Wishing all of you the best for those who try to stop during the Holidays! 

I noticed a lot of people during the Holidays try to stop but wait until their very few days of vacations, This is not going to do it frifriends, do it now while you still have a few days left. God speed to all of you!

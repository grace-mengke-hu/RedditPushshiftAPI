Just finished my first two weeks. Where did the challenge go?

Two weeks down, 217 cigs not smoked, over 32â‚¬ saved!

I had a few tough moments in the past two weeks, but I got through all of them and haven't had *any* actually difficult cravings in a couple of days now. It really has been reduced to an occasional thought, which is easy to overcome. 

When I walk into university now, I can smell who is a smoker and who isn't. I notice how terrible the entrance smells because of the people smoking there. I have friends over and I can still smell their stale smoke residue in the kitchen the next day, even after airing it out. Most of all, I can smell it on myself when I've been around smokers for a while. I never noticed these things when I was a smoker, because the smell was *always* there, on my jacket, my room, my hair, my clothes, my mouth and nose. Eugh. 

And brownish, sticky phlegm is practically gushing out of me every morning. Absolutely disgusting, but in a good way! Is there any way I can speed up the clean-up in my lungs?

Thanks for the support, Stopsmoking! I feel like I've made it! :D

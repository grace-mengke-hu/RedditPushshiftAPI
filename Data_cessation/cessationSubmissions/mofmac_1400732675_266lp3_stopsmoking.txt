picking my nose?

im currently smoke free 24 days, though reset badge 4 days ago because i had one smoke when i was out drinking, just stating this to make the point that may body is definitely in repair since only one cig has been inhaled in the past 24 days....
every day since quiting i havnt had episodes of clearing my lungs out by coughing, instead these past few weeks ive been picking my nose incessantly.
-very dry, and sometimes bloody snot is haunting my nostrils, i googled my symptons, found few forums with people commenting on a similiar sympton after quitting however no explanation as to why....am i clearing my lungs through my nose...because by day 24 (despite that one cig) id have thought id be coughing tar out, not expelling hard, sometime bloody snot...sinus infection? see a general practioner? google it? ask reddit?

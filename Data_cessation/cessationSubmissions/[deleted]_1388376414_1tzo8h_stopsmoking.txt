I had a dream

So last night I had a dream; 

We were in a jazz club and the lights were dimmed, everyone sat around a large oak table and the vibe was righteous. People were drinking, talking and soaking up the good times. It didn't take long before someone passed me a joint and I, absent minded, took a drag. 'SHIT' I thought and I passed it along, hoping this was all a dream... but then the band started playing! It was pretty smooth and I was  once again distracted by their velvety tones. In this state of jazz-induced confusion I must have agreed to have a cigarette because before I knew it someone had put a filter in my hand. This is when I put my foot down, I said 'no I shall not roll a cigarette' and I threw the filter across the table. Then, for some reason I had one of the musicians trumpets in my hand and I accidentally broke it in half. I then spent the rest of the dream trying to convincingly put it back together as he was a pretty big dude. Luckily I woke up before he found out.

I'm on the midnight train to the pink lung club now. Ain't getting off.

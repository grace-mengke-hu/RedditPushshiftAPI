I am free!

Today has been a year for me.

I had a bicycle wreck a year ago that left me paralyzed for months, don't know if I would have had the willpower to quit otherwise.

I had smoked for 20 years and tried for 12 years to quit. I feel free, I'll never put one of those nasty things in my mouth again!

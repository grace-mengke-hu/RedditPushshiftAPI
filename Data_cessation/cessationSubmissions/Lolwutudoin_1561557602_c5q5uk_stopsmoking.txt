My grandmother passed away due to COPD and other complications from smoking recently and I think it’s a wake up call for me to quit.

Hi everyone so my grandmother died in April after complications from smoking after a few years of non stop trips to the hospital and stuck on an armchair hooked up to an oxygen machine pretty much the whole day. She hated the fact she was always in the house all day as she always liked to keep busy and worked as a carer and would go out her way to help people no matter the time of day. She had COPD and glaucoma due to her smoking.

She always told me and my family she wanted to die because she was that ill and couldn’t take the pain she even signed a do not resuscitate form.

I have been a smoker since I was 14 and I think ever since my gran died and looking at the bad way she was in is a wake up call for me to stop smoking, but i’am really struggling to quit. Does anyone have ways to stop I have tried to stop a couple of times before and the longest I went smoke free was 2 weeks, but I always go back to smoking I really need help to quit all advice is appreciated.

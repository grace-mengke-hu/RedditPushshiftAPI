Last night they found a tumour on my stepdad's lung. Keep up the no smoking everyone.

He was admitted last night after coughing up lots of blood. They haven't confirmed a cancer diagnosis yet, but in a smoker for 40 years, what else it is going to be.

We all know smoking is stupid and bad for us. But it looks so much stupider after you've heard someone you love will most likely die from it. 

Don't smoke today.

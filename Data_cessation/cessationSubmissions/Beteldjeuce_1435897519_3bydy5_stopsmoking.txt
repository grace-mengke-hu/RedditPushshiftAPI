Easy to quit, hard to cope.

So this is my first time quitting for real in a few years. Last time i quit, i went for a full 6 months before a spiral of stress, guilt and depression sent me back to the coffin nails. Finally picking myself back up after half-heartedly "quitting" several times unsuccessfully over the past 3 years or so.

Its been relatively easy this time around; very much like the first time i managed to quit. I've been getting my ass back to the gym since the new year and recently started running again, all of which is great for keeping me off the death sticks. I'm just afraid of spiraling again like i have before...

Like i said, quitting is the easy part. Most days it never crosses my mind; went it does it's no longer that burning itch for a drag that i used to get, just a heavy sigh and a thought that goes "a smoke would help". But then i feel the heave in my chest that i've accumulated and i think better of it. 

The hard part is dealing with the part of myself that nicotine usually shuts off when it becomes a problem. Dealing with my short temper without the gentle caress of tobacco smoke in my lungs to tell me "everything's fine" has been the most difficult part of this process since without it, it seems like my irritability and frustration that i usually attribute to "needing a smoke" are now a part of who i am. The only thing that makes quitting hard is knowing that this part doesn't just go away and that i really do have to cope with my frustrations if i am to stay smoke-free. I know it gets easier, even if it never goes away, but i've used tobacco as a crutch for so long, its hard to imagine exactly how to cope without it.

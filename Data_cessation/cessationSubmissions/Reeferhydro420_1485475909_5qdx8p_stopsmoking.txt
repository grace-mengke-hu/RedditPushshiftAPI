Are these normal withdrawal symptoms?

It's been 52 hours since my last cigarette and I was doing fine until just now....Im having trouble saying words in a sentence when talking to people, using grunts and muttering out words to get my point across, very sudden anger....and I just out of the nowhere started breaking down and sobbing when I came to my room but literally felt normal in a few seconds. It's like mood swings X10....and it's kinda scary because for an abrupt moment, I felt a very strong urge to end my own life. It feels like I'm on an emotional rollercoaster and have no control over what my mind is thinking:( 

I'm not gonna use junk food to keep my nicotine cravings away anymore tho, I also suspect the blood sugar fluctuations I'm experiencing is causing some of the depression as well. Does anyone know of ways to tackle these issues?

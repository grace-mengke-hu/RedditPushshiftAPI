Day 5

It is my first serious attempt to quit smoking (one that passed over the couple of hours milestone). I am 28 female and I have been a one pack a day smoker for almost half my life. 
5 days ago I attended an Allen Carr seminar and everything seems ok so far. The main issue is that I am not 100% convinced that I really want to quit smoking. I understand that smoking does not come with any advantages, but just disadvantages, but somehow I have a relationship with cigarettes that reminds me more of a Stockholm syndrome.
I am quite an introvert person so my biggest carving happens when I am at work and I take my breaks. I was usually just going to puff a cigarette and then come back, no interaction with my mates, just me and my "friend". Now that space feels really empty, just taking less breaks and these breaks consist in going to the kitchen having a glass of water and getting back to my computer - so nothing special, I can drink water while I work too.... Before, when I was smoking, I was looking forward to the breaks (as any normal human being), now I get somehow sad thinking that there is nothing special about these breaks anymore. 
I think this is the hardest part that I have to deal with when it comes to quitting smoking. Which is the hardest part for you? Which of the ritual cigarettes is/ was the hardest to break up with?

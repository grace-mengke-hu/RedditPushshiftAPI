Is this what I've been doing to myself for the past 7 years?

Well I was out for New Years, and decided to bum a fag from a friend after about 2 weeks of my first proper quitting attempt. Was expecting something wonderful like when you don't smoke for a bit, but multiplied by how long you have not had any but oh my was that cig disgusting. Felt nauseous and giddy after and can't help but wonder how my body has been taking this all these years.

Well it's the new year, I shall be resetting my badge and continue trying to quit. To all those quitting as a new years resolution, all the best and stick to it!

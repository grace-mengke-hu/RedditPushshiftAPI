quit smoking after 25 years, should I quit drinking coke too?

Back in days I use to eat a chocolate bar and coke for breakfast while walking to class in college and smoke a cig. Now 25 years later, I finally managed to quit smoking (i month into the quit now) and thinking whether I should quit drinking coke too?

Wondering what people think about Coke? I used to drink 5-6 cans a day back in the days, now its around 2-3 cans a day. There have been times when I have gone months drinking just Coke without drinking any water. Should I quit or continue drinking Coke?

I drink regular coke (not the crappy diet stuff) and yes can coke tastes different than fountain coke which taste different than plastic bottle coke and I am not fat in any sense of the word, but now eating more and gaining wait after quitting smoking. got to reduce my eating as well.

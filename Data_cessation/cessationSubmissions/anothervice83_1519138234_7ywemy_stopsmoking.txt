Stupid cigarettes.

One pack of camel menthol’s a day for 22 years here... and while I do not miss the raunchy smell, the ridiculous money spent or the midnight coughs, I do miss smoking. Actually, I really miss smoking. I wish that at this point I could say I didn’t want one. I haven’t found a replacement for that ugly, addictive friend of mine. Food indulgence was my go-to for the first 3 weeks. Now, I’m working on working off those 10 pounds gained. Anyone else feel this way? What’s been your healthy alternatives?

30+ days and I'm missing cigarettes today.

It's been a month since I stopped smoking and today is the first day I'm having real bad cravings. I haven't thought about it much, but today it feels like I'm missing a good friend that's never coming back. 

I quit because I was disgusted with how much time I'd spend smoking, how my close friends don't smoke and I'd be the odd one out, how I felt a slave to it, etc. 

But today, im thinking of the good times! I had happy times with cigarettes and feel like I want to have those times come back.

Help! How do you guys deal with thoughts like this?

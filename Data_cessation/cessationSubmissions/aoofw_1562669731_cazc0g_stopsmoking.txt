Struggling at work in first week - would NRT help at this point?

First of all thanks to all of you, reading the posts here really helped convince me I could do this. 

I quit smoking cold turkey on Saturday (today is day 4) - I moved house this weekend and figured it would be a great time to build new habits in a new place. So far, it's been easy at home, the new environment thing is really helping. 

Work, however, is a different story. I feel like I'm spending my day thinking about smoking. 
My workday used to be 100% structured around smoke breaks and I now feel like the day drags on forever. I always got a little thrill when the next break time approached, but now I just get very intense cravings around those times. It's a real struggle, and I'm also completely useless at the moment as I can't seem to concentrate on my work. 

Yesterday was so hard I got really worried I would cave in, so I bought some nicotine gum as a safety net (but did not use it - honestly, just having it in my bag made me feel better). 

My question is this: according to the Smoke Free app, all nicotine has already left my body by now. So would the gum even help at all? I don't know how withdrawal actually works and I don't want to reintroduce nicotine into my body if it's actually all in my head at this point.

Day 2. What saved me from quitting Day 1.

Nicotine monster was raging last night in the evening of Day 1. Cravings, dizziness, mind games. 

What truly saved me, which others already recognize but which really needs further emphasis, was this:

Delay. 

At the peak of my most intense cravings, I told myself I'm going to the store and getting some cigarettes. In an hour.

Delaying it saved me. The cravings and the mind tricks cleared a bit after 15 min. I regained a little willpower and that was enough to end Day 1 smoke-free.

It's Day 2 now. I hope I don't give in.

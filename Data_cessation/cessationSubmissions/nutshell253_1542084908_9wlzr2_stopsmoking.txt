1 week feels life changing!

I’m one week smoke free today. One week feels like one month, but I feel amazing. 

I smoked all throughout the Navy, which was my coping mechanism to any sort of stress in my life. Today, I had one of the worst days at work and had the biggest urge to buy a pack. I’m so proud that I’m at the point where I am able to change my mind based off of how my body and mind has been feeling in this past week. So that idea quickly went to flames.

In just one week, for the first time since the military, I am able to beat my alarms and wake up on time. Food taste so wholesome again. I don’t feel inclined to smoke one after a workout and feel like garbage all over again. I don’t have to brush my teeth and wash my hands every time I step outside. 

As a once secret chain smoker, I just wanted to get this awesome news and feeling off my chest before I go to bed.

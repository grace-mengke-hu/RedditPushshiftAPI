Today is my quitday, and I'm terrified

I've been taking wellbutrin for 10 days and it's time to quit. I promised myself I would not buy any more tobacco, and I am running out sometime today.
The thing is, I am terrified. What if it's going to be insufferable? What if I don't make it this time either? I am quitting because I can hardly breathe, and I don't want to die.

Sorry for the disjointed post.

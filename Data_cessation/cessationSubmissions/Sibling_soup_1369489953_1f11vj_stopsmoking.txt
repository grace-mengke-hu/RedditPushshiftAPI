Stopping after exams

I'm in my sophomore year of high school. My dad comes up to me and says: "If you quit smoking before the 1st of July, I will give you four tickets to the Avenged Sevenfold concert. I will quit too."

I've been dying to go see Avenged Sevenfold for three years, but I haven't had the chance.

It's gonna be totally easy to quit.

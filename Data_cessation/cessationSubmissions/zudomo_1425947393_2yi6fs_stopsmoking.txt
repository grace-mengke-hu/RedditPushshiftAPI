Cravings are starting back up

This past week the craving for a cigarette has been coming back strong all week. I was at the point where I had unsubscribed from the sub, stopped counting days, wouldn't even think of a cig. I'm sure it's probably stress from having a friend and grandmother pass away in the same week, some financial troubles, but Jesus it's worse now than the first 7 days.

Worried about going back to work

Hi guys,

Have quit for 6 days now and really pleased. I'm really worried about starting work back after the Christmas holidays though. I work a really stressful job in public relations and I'm worried I'll be craving cigarettes a the time and it will make me more stressed and impact on my work. Does anyone have any good tips for getting through stressful times at work while quitting?

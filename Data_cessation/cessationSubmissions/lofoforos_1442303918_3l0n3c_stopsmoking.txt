Double milestone reached.

Manage to overcome the ultimate fight with my girlfriend on her period... and 10 days without a smoke yeah baby!!! Cravings are nothing you can't handle. Insomnia still here and I guess is what will bother me this week. Best wishes to everyone trying to quit. (...by the way, I kinda hate "quit" maybe "WIN" is more appropriate)... so lets WIN this hurdle!!

How to start Cutting

Hey Reddit,

So I guess I should premise this with the fact I'm a 19 year old college student. I'm sure the story is familiar. Social smoking turned habit. Well anyways, I'm up to ~6 a day for about a year. I know it could be worse, but it recently hit me that I haven't been able to go more than a couple of days without a cig at this age. I'd like to be at around 1 a day, maybe even work to tapering down to 0, but I can't even imagine that rn. Any tips/help?

EDIT: that title looks really awkward...

6 Days clean from Nicotine

Long story short, I've chewed tobacco since the age of 18 and now am 26 about to turn 27. I've decided to stop once again, last time I lasted 3 months, this time for good. 

Do want to say, day 6 of being clean from this is extremely difficult and everything makes me mad. 

Cars driving slow, people hitting the crosswalk button (in turn getting a premature red light), .50 cent credit card use charges, going to work, going to bed, talking to friends and family. literally everything. Im such a POS right now its not even funny, Im going into solitude so I figured I'd share my bright "solitude" idea with reddit. Im hoping my day of solitude will prevent me from allowing my illogical rage spill out.

Man i hate myself for getting addicted to this, lol.

Best of luck to the rest of you!

Today is the day...

So I'm about to smoke my last fag.  Over the last few days i've gone from smoking 15/20 maybe even 30 a day to just 4 or 5.  Today was a bad day and i smoked 10.  However, I decided that the reason I smoked 10 is because i had been smoking a few a day...well no more.  I'm about to have my last one and rinse what's left under the tap and bite the bullet.  I dont need them or enjoy them.  I'm not giving up anything or losing anything...I will do this.  I wont be easy, but anything worth while will always be tough.  But I am not paying for the privilege of filling my lungs with shit, emptying my bank account of my goals and dreams and a lack of confidence because I smoke...I'm ending it now!  Thank you all for giving me the drive and belief to do it.

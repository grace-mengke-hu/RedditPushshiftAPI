Day 4

After a weekend of heavy drinking and smoking I decided to quit smoking after numerous attempts. It's been a bad habbit for 8 years and it's time to clean up my body. I've stopped smoking since last sunday may 4th. The first day was easy because i had an accumulated hangover of 4 days so didn't feel like smoking anyway. But now life has started again and so has school (dutch spring break was last week). During the day i have no trouble keeping my mind of cigarettes but in the evening I start to feel very restless and hungry. By hungry I don't mean the hunger you feel when you're about to have diner, but more like cravings (or munchies). Since I lost a lot of weight in the past I don't feel like giving in to those munchies either. So I'm basically fighting 2 bad habits at once. It sucks and it's hard. Any advice or moral support is needed. I'm fairly new to reddit and figured this would be a good way of entering the community and getting help with something that's really hard.

PS: I'm not english so i appologize for any spelling errors.

EDIT 1: day 7 right now, I'm really happy I haven't touched a cigarette. Even though my girl still smokes and I buy her cigarettes the urge has gone (nicotine has left the body by this time). The only thing remaining is the habit, but because I'm studying Sports & Movement Sciences I have learned a lot about behaviour so I can rationalise it much better. 

This is definitely a mind over matter kinda thing.
My fellow quitters: Hang in there!

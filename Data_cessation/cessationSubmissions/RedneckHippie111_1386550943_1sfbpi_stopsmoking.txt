Passed my biggest test so far...

So last night was my company Christmas party, aka, the night where all the "non smokers" smoke like chimneys.  I knew how it was gonna be, and planned ahead.  I told a few of my coworkers they had my permission to slap a cigarette out of my mouth if they saw me smoking. I also brought along my e-cig, which I haven't used since I quit.  I figured if it came down to it, I'd rather use that than be tempted by a real smoke. I only used it once, and actually forgot about it most of the night. I kept myself busy drinking, talking, and dancing (I blame the booze for that) and was able to get through the night without dwelling on my cravings too long.

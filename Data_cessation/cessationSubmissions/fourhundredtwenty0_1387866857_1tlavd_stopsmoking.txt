damn

Well after reaching the 72 hour point I went to a bar with a friend, the dude who is always down to drink and chain smoke. I knew what I was getting into and went anyway. Smoked 2, rather bummed 2. Sucks to undo all the hard work - being an asshole to my family, being an asshole here on the reddits.

What really makes me feel shitty is not petting my cats with my smoking hand.

So I gotta ask, what do *you* do when you really need a fucking smoke and your out with people. Meditating is a good alone activity, as is stretching, as is yoga, as is everything else. But with people all bets are off. I remember my first real quit, I thought I was gunna explode turning down that smoke. Obviously I didn't, but that doesn't make it any easier now.


I fucked up and I take responsibility, but damn do I feel bad. Determined more now, might be a shitty holiday, but it's all about the long term.


Also sorry if I've been an asshole to anyone here... more to come (unfortunately)...

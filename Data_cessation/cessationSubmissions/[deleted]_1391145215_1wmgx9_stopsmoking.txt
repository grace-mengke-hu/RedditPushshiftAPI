Psilocybin and Addiction. Link in post (x-post from r/stopdrinking).

[Here's the article.](http://www.beckleyfoundation.org/2010/09/psilocybin-facilitated-addiction/)

I drank some mushroom tea back in the fall the first time I quit drinking to see if it would help with my depression. Felt pretty good about the results. Mushrooms aren't considered addictive and may actually be helpful in treating addiction and depression.

Curious to hear some thoughts and opinions about this. Thanks!

When will I cough it all up?

I quit smoking a few days ago (this is day 3). Smoker for 15 years, had to stop before I get to 30. I know this is the one, the one where I make it and don't go back to them, despite still kinda wanting to every day. So, I'm pretty ready to start clearing out the lungs.


My question, when will my chunky nasty cough come? So far, nothing. I Do occasionally partake in other types of smoking, but no tobacco... could that be delaying it?

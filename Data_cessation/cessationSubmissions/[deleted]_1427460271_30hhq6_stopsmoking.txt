Phlegm in throat

I have not smoked for 80 days now. My health has improved a lot. I wasn't a chain smoker, about 2-3 cigs a day,maximum 5 or 6. I have phlegm in my throat ever since I quit smoking. I don't have any breathing problems. And the phlegm is light-yellowish, not very dark. There is no coughing,I just bring it up my throat and spit it out. Is this a withdrawal symptom? Should I visit my doctor?

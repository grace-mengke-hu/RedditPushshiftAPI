So 30 mins away from day 5 down!

So 30 mins away from day 5 and let me tell you, being bipolar and quitting smoking suckkkkkkkkkkssssssssss!

I've already been in I think 3 fights with my husband, mostly about fiances but I can't seem to let anything go.  

I used smoking I guess as my safety valve, instead of letting thing bubble and boil I just smoked to release the tension and anxiety. Now it's like you have no safety valve. It's just bubbling and boiling, you try to not say anything because you know the moment you do it'll come spilling out.  Well that don't work now does it?  The depression comes and goes now, like waves, even with medication.  The rest like cravings and stuff isn't really the big problem I can ace those!

Now.....so far anyway I got a new obsession.  EXERCISE!  Lately here 35-40 mins of cardio 5 times a week is like my drug. If I don't exercise, I feel awful! 25lbs gone as of today! Down from 215 to 190 and no I haven't gained any weight at all yet from quitting smoking!  Low carb diet, 1 cheat day a week, and exercise.

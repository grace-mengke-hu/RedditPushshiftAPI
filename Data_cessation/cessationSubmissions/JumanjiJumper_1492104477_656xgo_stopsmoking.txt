Made it to 24 hours...!

Hi all :) I've been thinking about quitting for a while, finally got a kick up the arse to get on with it properly.

Feeling pretty grouchy and fidgety, but tired at the same time. I don't think I've thought about smoking as much as I have in the past day before! I've stopped in today to avoid the temptation of buying a pack...doggo cuddles have helped! 

What helped you guys through the first few weeks?

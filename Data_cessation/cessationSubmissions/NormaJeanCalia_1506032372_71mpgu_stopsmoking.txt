1M 8d 22hrs. It’s been a LONG month. This isn’t easy.

Yesterday at 8pm I lost the best uncle I had. Small cell lung cancer. Smoked like a chimney. Oddly it triggers me to smoke. Stress I’m guessing. RIP Uncle Abe. 

My taste buds have changed? Or I can taste things differently now and some food I love I now hate. Anyone else in my boat? I use to LOVE mayonnaise but now I can smell it and taste it’s odd flavor and it makes me sick. Mentally I still want it and like but the taste grossed me out.

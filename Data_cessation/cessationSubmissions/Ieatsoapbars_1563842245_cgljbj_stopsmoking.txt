Whelp this is it

Haven't smoked in years but I picked up snusing and vaping to stop. I've been doing so for the past 4 years and decided today enough is enough. I read through Allen carr's book again which isn't completely relevant since I don't smoke but It helps frame my mind about the demon drug nicotine. 

I had my wife lock all of my stuff up in my safe and hide the key from me. I'll be doing tomorrow nicotine free for the first time in just about 9 years. Wish me luck guys!

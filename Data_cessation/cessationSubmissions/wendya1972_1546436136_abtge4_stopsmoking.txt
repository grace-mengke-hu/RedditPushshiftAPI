33 yrs a smoker need help with cravings

Help! I’m trying so hard to quit smoking. I’ve been trying the last 2 yrs with no success. I’m a 2 pack a day smoker, and I have tried everything to quit. Chantex works for a few days but I have depression with it, the patches.. I did great with for about 2 weeks (used the gum with it) and then it seemed to stop working. I found myself craving a ciggy so bad I was climbing the walls. I’ve been off this past week with the holidays and I’ve slowly cut back, maybe not even one full pack a day? (My husband and I will share a pack when we’re both home) today I thought would be “the day” I was feeling a little nervous so I threw on a patch (strongest mg) and I’ve been craving one and withdrawing bad for the past 2 hrs. I found a partial butt and took two hits and wanted to be sick. Does anyone have any advice or suggestions or have any experience with the patches not working? 
I really want and need to quit! I’m 46 yrs old, I lost my mom to smoking this past April (4 packs of menthols a day.. sometimes more) to lung cancer, she was 63. I don’t want to leave my children in the same way. I want to be around to see grandkids someday! I have even gotten physically fit! I’ve lost 130lbs, I’m a runner now (I know right?) and run 5ks and half marathons. I have accomplished any goal I’ve set for myself except this one. I feel like I’m fighting a losing battle.

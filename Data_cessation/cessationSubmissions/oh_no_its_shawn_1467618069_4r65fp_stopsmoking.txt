I'm only on my 3rd day cold turkey

And I'm really impressed that I pulled it off. I've been smoking a pack a day for about 2 and a half years (23 yo). The two most habitual times of smoking where I thought I couldn't resist are when I'm drinking, and when I'm working (I'm at server so you know the deal). I stopped smoking Friday, got pretty drunk and still said no. Then worked a stressful double and still didn't commit to a puff. Maybe its to early to be excited but jumping through those trigger centers made me kinda proud. I feel like I could do this forever. Wish me luck!

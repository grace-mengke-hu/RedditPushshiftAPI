15 Days ï¼† counting

By now I have experienced all the daily situations without cigarettes: drinking my morning coffee w/o a cig. Driving to work w/o a cig. Breaks at work with co-workers w/o a cig. Driving back home w/o a cig. Having dinner w/o a cig... so I can't remember why I started smoking again everytime after I quit. So what caused you guys to start smoking again?

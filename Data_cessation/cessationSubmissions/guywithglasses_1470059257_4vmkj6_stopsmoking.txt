12 hours in after multiple attempts to quit after ~15 years. I feel super confident this time.

Honestly, I feel super confident every time but THIS time feels different. My gf is also quitting and I feel having support in the same household will be super beneficial to each of us. 

We are going cold-turkey (after much internal deliberation). Please, if anyone has any cold-turkey tips they want to share, feel free to do so. Everything is appreciated. Thanks!

Edit: I also wanted to add (but forgot) that I am medicated for ADD with Vyvanse. It has done wonders for me with its intended purpose, but when I feel the biggest effect from the medication, I want a cigarette every 30-40 minutes like I haven't had one  in days. I would love to hear from someone in a similar boat. Thanks again!

One month in and I'm almost ready to give up

26 y/o, I quit on new year's eve, the last week was very emotionally taxing, at first I found out that I have herpes (the first type), after that I got tinnitus, and after going to the doctor with it I also found out that I have kyphosis in my neck. My life is a fucking mess, I only go to work and sleep (because of the tinnitus related drugs), the lexotanil isn't helping at all and I'm anxious as fuck, I'm trying to use the "believe in the best, prepare for the worst" mindset, but this sound just drives me crazy. I want to cry.

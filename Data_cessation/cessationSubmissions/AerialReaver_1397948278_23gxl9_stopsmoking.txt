Reset my badge, I caved!

It was a really stressful day and I didn't get enough sleep, I thought I would be fine. But I caved, I knew it was wrong and it tasted so shitty. I would've had a month in Monday, I was doing so well, having a few drinks a couple nights ago didn't even bother me. Just gotta stay strong and beat this!

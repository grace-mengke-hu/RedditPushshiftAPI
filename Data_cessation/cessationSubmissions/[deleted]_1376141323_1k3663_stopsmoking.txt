Keeping my hands busy

Hi,

I started when I was 14 and was at ~30 cigarettes a day between 15 and 18, then I quit abruptly - I started feeling pain in my lungs and it really scared me, so one night when I couldn't sleep because of it I just decided to quit. That was almost 2 month ago (and the pain is gone!).

I'm actually doing well - despite being in a very smoking environment (I'd say 80% of my friends smoke) - and don't feel the need to smoke anymore. However, I do miss having something to do keep my hands busy while freeing my mind. There are actually two situation where it becomes a problem:

- Drinking. I live in a city where you can smoke in every bar and club, and that means that I used to always have a cigarette in my hand when drinking a beer. I was almost always the least drunk person in the group because I could just sit back and smoke my cigarette while the others were emptying their glass. Now I can't to that anymore, and I'm having trouble not being the quickest drinker around, because the only thing I have to keep my hands busy is my glass. It doesn't necessarily leeds me to drink more, because I still wait for the others to get another beer, but it does bother me to have to worry about this every time I'm trying to chill out with my friends. Moreover, I don't live in the country I was born in, and when I'm in a group with 10 people speaking a foreign language, I just can't follow the conversation. In this situation, it's hard to just sit in the corner and have nothing to do.

- Having breaks. I study architecture and the most important part of the program are the projects we do in teams of 2 people. My partner is one of the 20% non-smokers in my environment, so when I stopped smoking, we stopped having breaks every hour. While it was great for our productivity (basically we spared 10 minutes - my breaks were more like 2 cigarettes than 1 - every 60 minutes), it wasn't so great for our creativity. Having a break with nothing on your mind was really great to come up with new solutions and take a global perspective on the project. When you start to get hysterical because you realize you will never meet the deadlines (that happens often when you study architecture), going out for a smoke is a wonderful thing. You come back calm and motivated.

Basically, my problem is that I started smoking early, so I never dealt with stressful situations without being able to go out for a smoke, and I never had a beer without a cigarette. Now I somehow have to learn this and it's really new/weird for me. For now I eat sunflower seeds but it's expensive (in the first days when I ate a LOT of them, it was more expensive than cigarettes), it leaves disgusting peels everywhere and I'm growing tired of explaining to people why I eat them.

So i think what i need is a way of keeping my hands busy during breaks and bar/party situations. I did look at the few non-smokers around and they just sit here doing nothing. I tried that and it just feels weird. Maybe I just need some more time to get used to it? In the meantime, if one of you guys has a tip for me, it would be great. Thanks!




**TL;DR** How do you keep your hands busy when having a break, drinking a beer or dancing in a club, the way a cigarette kept your hands busy?

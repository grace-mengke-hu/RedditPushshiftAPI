I wouldn't think of going back...

Now that I have powered through the rough days of nicotine withdrawal, I would never think of going back.  That was hell and I will not be doing that again.  I used nicotine for 30+ years without every really stopping for any amount of time.  Smoked, chewed, nicotine patches, nicotine gum, nicotine lozenges, SNUS, etc.  All to deliver the evil nicotine to my brain.  The first 24 hours was surreal.  It almost felt like I was on a drug trip or something the withdrawals were so intense.  I NEVER want to go through that again.  P.S.  Read Allen Carr's Easy way to stop smoking for motivation and quit the day I finished the book.  Good luck everyone!  Fuck you International Nicotine Cartel!

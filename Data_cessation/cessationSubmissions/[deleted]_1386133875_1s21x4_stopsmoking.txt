4 days smoke free then slip up :/ Help?

Just found myself digging though a weeks worth of trash to find the half-pack I threw out days ago. Pretty disgusted with self right now. 

How do you guys deal with the guilt if you slip up and smoke? I smoke because I get anxiety. The guilt and shame of slipping up makes me even more anxious making me want to smoke even more. It's a bad cycle. Any tips? I'm tired of beating myself up over this but at the same time I don't want to make excuses for smoking (i.e. anxiety). 

I am quitting cold turkey right now. I have done so in the past for years at a time but whenever a traumatic stress comes into my life (like a breakup for example) I relapse. sigh. Not sure what to do. I've tried Chantix too but it made me very sick. 

Any thoughts would be helpful. Thanks guys! xo

EDIT: Thanks guys! Haven't smoked since I posted this :)

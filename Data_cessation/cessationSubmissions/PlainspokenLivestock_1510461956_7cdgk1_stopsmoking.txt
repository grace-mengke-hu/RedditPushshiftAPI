22 days, some aspects are better, others aren't

Long-time lurker here, finally signed up tonight when the mission on SmokeFree was to help three people starting or struggling with their quit. Then I thought I might as well try making my own post :)

There's a whole long story behind my decision to quit, but the straw on the camel's back was my anxiety around going on a trip and being anxious about smoking. I was SO preemptively anxious about being scolded by the people I was going with, or planning when to smoke so as not to disrupt any activities, or if I should bring them with me or purchase them there.... I mean, weeks of anxiety around cigarettes. What a waste of mental energy. And then it occurred to me that I'm the only one making me suffer like this, and I had the power to change this. So I did. I bought Allen Carr's ebook, sat down and read it one Saturday afternoon, smoking the last of my cigarettes, and quit.

I'd like to say it was easy as that. I went 5.5 days. Had a stressful day at work, came home, bought some beer, bought a pack, and drank and smoked the night away. The next morning, the day I was leaving for my trip, I smoked the rest of the cigarettes, showered, and haven't looked back since. Today is 22 days!!

I'm a bit surprised though, I feel like every morning I wake up feeling like I smoked a pack the night before. My heart rate spikes and races at random times. My breathing gets haggard at random times, even if I'm just sitting. Maybe that always happened and I just ignored it, maybe it's withdrawal or recovery. The hardest thing to accept is that if I am having trouble breathing, I did that damage to myself over 20 years.

But the important thing is I didn't smoke yesterday and I didn't smoke today. One day at a time.

And thanks to everyone on this subreddit, it's been really interesting reading your posts the last three weeks!

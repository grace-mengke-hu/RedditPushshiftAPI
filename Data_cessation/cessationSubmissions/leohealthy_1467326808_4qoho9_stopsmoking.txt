Feeling Elated

I'm so glad I'm a non smoker. The past few days I've noticed how socially outcast smokers are, puffing next to bins and in back rooms and alleys, and realised that that was me for so many years.
I've made some new friends and one is a smoker and I'm so happy that I'm one-off the non smokers in the group. 
It feels good making decisions for my health and heart

Please excuse the graphic nature of this question three weeks in...

So I knew there would be constipation problems when I quit, and there was. About a week and a half ago I had a particularly uncomfortable session on the john, and since then it has kind of hurt a bit when I do a number 2... even though three weeks in I am no longer constipated. 

Wondering if maybe it's just healing down there and if people have had this happen to them... seems coincidental with the quitting smoking, but also you know... worries about colon cancer or whatever. 

Just thought I'd ask.

Cheers,

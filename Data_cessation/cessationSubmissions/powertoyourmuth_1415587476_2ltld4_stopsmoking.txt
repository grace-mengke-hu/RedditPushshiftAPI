Associate pain with smoking.

This is something I have read in the Tony Robbins book Awaken the Giant Within but has stayed with me way after I finished the book. 

Humans are bound to act to run away from pain or seek pleasure. If a behaviour is associated with pain, you will not want to do it.(for ex. the child who touches fire feels pain and stops). If a behaviour is associated with pleasure, you will want do to it. We all have associated smoking cigarettes with pleasure, mainly through its effects on dopamine but also through the mental picture we have for smoking. It is something that we believe relaxes/awakens/focuses (whatever you believe) us. Although rationally we know it doesn't, it is engrained in our brain as an activity that gives us pleasure.

I have gone 100 days without a cigarette now and altough I know it is not easy at the start, I can now see that associating pain with smoking is how I quit. A life with cigarettes is a life of

-Bad Smells
-Stress
-Lethargy
-Ceaseless Coughs
-Fear of Cancer
-Shame

for me. Whenever I see someone smoking or think back to the days I did, the pain of that lifestyle comes into my mind and I naturally don't want to do it. That's how I don't give in to the thought "Just one", I know I want my life to be free of addictions.

Good luck everyone.

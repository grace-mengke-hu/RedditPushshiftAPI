3 months

What helped me was thinking that smoking is only bad for me. The good feeling that comes from it is just addiction brain-washing me, and making me damage my body. The nicotine wants to win, don't let it.

You can feel the same calming feeling through exercise or meditation or a multitude of things. Do anything except smoke! It is *only* bad for you. There is nothing good from it.

Just look how much it's made you addicted. The health problems like high blood pressure and not being able to breathe properly. Fuck that.

Replace it with something else and above all, don't think about it. Get away from situations where it's easy to think about it (i.e. parties etc.). You don't have to give up going to social events like that forever, but just for a few months until it's easier. Because that's just it...

It gets way, way easier after the first month. In fact I haven't even thought about it for the past 3 weeks. I have no intention of ever going back.

You can do this just like I did.

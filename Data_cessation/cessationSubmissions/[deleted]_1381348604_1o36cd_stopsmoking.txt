i want to quit but i dont want to quit

i know it bad, i know its terrible.

but like every single break im outside smoking, i see no reason to quit, i have money to blow (literally) and all my friends smoke too.

please reddit give me real reasons to quit because im making it look like to myself that it isnt that bad

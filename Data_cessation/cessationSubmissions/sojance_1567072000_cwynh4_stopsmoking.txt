Nicotine Lozenge Habit

Hi,

So a while back I picked up the nicotine lozenges as I was in a facility that didn’t allow smoking. Now I am totally hooked on the lozenges and take multiple at a time and over 25 a day, I almost feel like it’s just as habit forming as the smoking and I don’t know how to stop. Any advice?

This is the first year in 17 years that I don't have "quit smoking" as a resolution - because I finally successfully quit!

Long time lurker, first time poster.

I finally quit smoking in 2016. Tonight my heart is with all of those who are savoring their last few cigs before the Big Quit tomorrow. You can do it!!!

I used Chantix to quit. Zero side effects - I felt wonderful and it made quitting easy breezy, but please know that my experience is my own and not everyone enjoys Chantix as much as I did. And if your insurance won't pay for it, it's insanely expensive. I did two rounds, because I couldn't afford to keep taking it for a full 3 months the first time, and started smoking again. In a few months, I went on Chantix again, stuck with it, and finally just didn't feel like smoking anymore.

My new husband quit with me, but he did it cold turkey. He had my support, but there were definitely times when one or the other of us backslid and convinced the other to have a smoke. For about 5 months after quitting, I would smoke 1 or 2 after/during drinking (not every time I drank, but sometimes), but then I decided it's best to stay home when drinking (no cigarettes at home, and nowhere to drive) and now I can safely say my urges are MUCH less severe than they used to be. They're not gone, but they're getting less and less urgent so I feel that one day they will be gone altogether.

2017 will be the first year since I was 16 that I will be 100% cigarette free. Good luck to those of you about to make the leap! It's so much nicer on this side!

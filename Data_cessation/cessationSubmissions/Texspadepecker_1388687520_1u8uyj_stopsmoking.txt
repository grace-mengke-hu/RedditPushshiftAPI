Day One...Is this hell?

For my New Years resolution, I promised the girlfriend that I would quit trying to quit, and actually nut up and do it.

So, I haven't smoked since last night around 7:30pm...
(New years isn't over until the hangover is gone, right?)

Its now 12pm the next day...

Holy shit, I'm a cranky dick head.


I seriously think this is one of the most difficult things I've ever tried to do, I bought one of those disposable nicotine free e-cigs from the gas station 25 minutes ago just to kind of keep my hands and mouth busy, it kind of helps, it says on the side of the box that its the same as a pack and a half to two packs depending on "technique"... At the rate im going im going to burn this thing out by the end of the day...

The sweating, the cravings, the irritability... I hate Hate HATE it!

But, after smoking a pack a day for 6 years, Today is the first day of freedom! I just don't want to be a slave to something anymore, I hate that I'm such a cock when I can't have a cigarette, and Im sick of having to stand outside in the middle of winter (FYI its -36 here right now, so that alone is some kind of motivation to quit in its self.)
just to "get my fix".

I want to be healthy, and I want to be happy.

So, Here we go.

Rome wasn't built in a day, and I'm sure there wasn't any hiccups along the way either, I can't promise myself that I won't slip, Shit happens. 

But it's time to take control.

Good Luck everyone.

Quitting vaping after two months of consistent use

I've been vaping constantly since November 1st and I'm not sure how addicted I am, but I'm committing to quit today. I've tried to quit once and lasted 3 days but my mind rationalized that I "deserved" a nicotine hit.

I usually vape 2-3 tanks full of 18mg/ml liquid (average 3ml per day), so I absorb â‰¤ 54mg of nicotine per day. Equivalent to ~4 cigarettes, assuming nicotine from vapor absorbs at the same rate as smoke.

**Edit - [This study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3935206/) suggests that absorption is lower using electronic cigarettes:**
> **After 5 minutes of EC use, plasma nicotine levels were substantially lower compared to smoking one tobacco cigarette (almost 3-fold lower compared to new- and 4-fold lower compared to first-generation device).**

Does it sound like I'm deep into addiction? If so, do you have any advice on if it's best to taper (vape progressively lower concentration liquid, vape less often) or quit cold turkey? I would appreciate any help.

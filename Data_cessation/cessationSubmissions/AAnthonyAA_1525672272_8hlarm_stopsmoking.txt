9 days without a cigarette and my head is happy but my cravings are eating at me like a stomach ulcer.

Thankfully I don't have one available and I don't want to go back to that horrific, stinky, disease bringing, teeth yellowing, money burner.  My mouth feels great now, and I smell better and am waking up without phlegm all over my throat.  Looking forward to having a fat wallet and less of a depressive lifestyle.

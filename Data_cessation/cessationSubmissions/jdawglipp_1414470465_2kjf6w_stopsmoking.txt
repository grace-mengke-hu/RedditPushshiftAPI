I reset my badge after 48 days. Don't make the same mistake I did!

This is how it all went wrong.
I left school for the weekend for my father's wedding and stayed over my best friends the whole time who is a smoker (which is my fault that he is a smoker) and started talking about how much I missed smoking. After the drinks started rolling and the drunkenness set in, I said screw it. Give me some smokes. Next morning when we woke up we immediately bought two packs of cigarettes and both ended up killing both of our packs, which ended up with more packs of smokes and more and more regret (for me atleast). Now here I lay back at school with a half empty pack and kicking my self in the ass.

Moral of the story is, don't ever think "I'll only smoke one" it will not end well, and can potentially ruin hard earned work in quitting.
Stay Strong

Day 0 - I think it's time to take the plunge

Hey everyone,

Not really sure what I'm doing here. I've been a smoker on-and-off for about 8 years. I'm on about a pack a day, and until this afternoon, I loved every minute of smoking. It had developed into a fetish for me, and I got pleasure in more ways than one.

This evening, I coughed so hard that I threw up the entire contents of my stomach. My chest tightened, and I felt like I was having a heart attack. That's something I don't want two weeks shy of my 24th birthday. 

I have an e-cigarette, but I've never used it. I've still got about 8 cigarettes left in my pack, and I need to make sure I don't go out and buy any more tomorrow. 

Has anyone else been in a similar situation, where the dependancy isn't just on the nicotine and the physical action, but it's deep set in your mindset that you're a smoker, and it's a great thing to be a smoker?

I realise this is a pretty unusual post, and I apologise for the slightly NSFW content, but I'm desperate for any advice anybody can give me. 

Quitting smoking sounds simple on paper - you just don't put another cigarette in your mouth, ever - but in reality, as I'm sure you all know, it's so much more difficult. 

Where's the best place to start? What are the best coping techniques? Are there any major surprises coming up with quitting smoking? (For instance, will I feel sick, or have a headache, or anything similar for a few days?)

I've given up once in the past, but that only lasted about 6 months.

Sorry about the rambling post - I'm not feeling at my peak tonight, and I'm just looking for some support, and somebody to tell me that it is possible.

Thanks everyone,
PJ :)

Weird side effect or is it just me?

So here's the thing, I always have vivid dreams and I pretty much always remember them.

When I quit smoking, I quit dreaming. Obviously this is incorrect, I dreamt, but I didn't remember any dreams.

Then last night I binge dreamt. 

1. I dreamt I smoked - not in a good way. I dreamt I was exhaling and     stubbing out the smoke and felt like a failure.

which turned into:

2. A really scary nightmare that would make no sense if I explained it here, but apparently (my husband says), I was screaming in my sleep.

which let to:

3. Erm nevermind, let's just say it wasn't my husband.

Is anyone else having weird dreams/nightmares?

I am need advice on the one thing keeping me from stopping smoking.

i am not the best at getting thoughts from my head into text and i was never that good in English at school. i was always clowning around. so bare with me please.

when i first started smoking it was not long after i had been jumped outside a local swimming pool. I was 12 at the time and they guy who done it was 18 at the time (i am now 21). when i got back to school after being in hospital for a few days i found myself being really anxious around anyone who was a teenager or under 30. 
for the next few weeks i had different thoughts on how to stop it from happening again. i started dressing different wear timberland boots jeans and jackets to make myself appear tough. i noticed all the hard people at the school smoking and i thought if i smoked i would look hard as well. i started smoking and it help me have more confidence to go out. I was still terrified to be on my own but whenever i seen someone as i was walking to my friends house if i hadn't turned and ran i would light a cig and feel my posture improve head up and have an angry face to scare whoever it was away. 
the problem for me now is that anytime i leave the house i need to have fags with me or i can't walk up the street or walking towards a shop i am going into without lighting up.

i know its a dumb reason to start and to keep on doing it. i have spent the last 9 years telling myself this make you look like someone not to mess with. its a crutch i can't get away from. i know it doesn't make a difference and i don't need to do it but in the situations i get anxious in, all logic goes and its have a fag or run away. 

can anybody give me advice on how to get over this need to smoke when anxious outside of my house. Anything at all would be appreciated thanks.

sorry if that made no sense.

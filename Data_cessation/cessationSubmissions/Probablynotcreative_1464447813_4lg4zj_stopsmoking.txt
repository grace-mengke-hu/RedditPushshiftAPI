I can't process anger like before I quit and I feel like it's killing me. Has anyone else experienced this?

I've always been quick to anger but when I smoked (I started at 18 so my entire adult life, like many of you guys) I would also get over it quickly. 

This past few weeks I can't let go of any anger. I feel like I'm carrying it in my sternum and anytime something minor happens I snap. But I don't want a cigarette and I'm not craving them. I'm angry at legitimately angering issues (drama with my husbands family) but it's holding on for days now. I guess I never learned any other mechanism for calming down besides smoking and now I'm a train wreck. 

Can anyone offer any insight?

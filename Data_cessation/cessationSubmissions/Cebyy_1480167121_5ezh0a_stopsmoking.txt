Around 63 hours in

I know I'm only 63 hours in but I have to say I'm feeling great, today was the first time in my smoking years that I didn't immediately look for a smoke as soon as I woke up and that shouts massive progress at me event though it's nothing amazing yet. Last night was the hardest so far, I sat with an ecigarette in my hand last night for about a half an hour but I didn't use it cause I knew I didn't want it and it's also cheating. I got this!

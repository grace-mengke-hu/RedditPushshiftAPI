I can breathe!

For the past 4+ years, I've spent most of my evenings drinking and smoking Cloves (those cigar cigarettes). It's an enigma why I even started smoking - I have horrible lungs that can't handle any cigarettes when I am not drinking and I get bronchitis every 3 months or so. But here I am - I go through at least 1/2 a pack while I consume 2 bottles of champagne mixed with Diet  Mt Dew on the couch each night. Sometimes I go through the whole pack. Sometimes I decide I need another bottle of champagne and get another pack of cigarettes just incase I need some more. 

10 days ago I decided to try out Sober October. I haven't smoked, nor have I drank, and I feel that elated feeling that people talk about who are newly sober. I can walk from my car to the office without feeling like I can't breathe! I exercised for a bit over the last two days! I am finally over my nightly coughing fits. 

I can get used to this!

I’m quitting right now

I got strep this weekend and haven’t smoked since Saturday night. I’m going to use this as an opportunity to finally say goodbye to cigarettes. I’ve been cold turkey the last two days but also sick. So I know tomorrow at work I will be hit with a host of triggers. Wish me luck everyone. Any tips you guys have would be awesome to hear. Thanks in advance.

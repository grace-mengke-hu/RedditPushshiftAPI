Need serious help combating the side effects of Champix. What do I do?

I'm 62 days into Champix now. The nausea is easy to handle, the farts while annoying are a minor nuisance, but the insomnia and completely irrational mood swings have been unbearable for about a month and a half now. I'm missing shifts at work because I'm too exhausted to remember my schedule, and when I'm there I'm unable to concentrate or multitask, things I was once proud to do easily. My relationship with my SO is suffering dramatically at the hands of anger and depression and what hurts the most is knowing it's just the medication. It feels like a never-ending argument between my emotions and my logic and I cant stand that the most.

I'm out of answers guys and gals, I need to quit smoking and I need to stick with this medication because it works for me. I know if I stop taking the pills I'll pick up the pack, I just feel like I'm giving up so much more than cigarettes. Quitters via Champix, how did you overcome these obstacles?

Edit: Thanks for the support everyone, but I feel I should definitely specify I have no suicidal ideation, and I have spoken to my doctor who told me the worst thing I can do is not finish the 12 week program. I've only 4 weeks left, but things like my job and SO are not able to wait around for me to finish.

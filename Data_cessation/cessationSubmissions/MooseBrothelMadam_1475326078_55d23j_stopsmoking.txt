I'm on Day 5, and desperate to sleep.

In the event that I do get precious sleep, I have vivid nightmares involving relevant issues in my life and not cigarettes for some reason, but most of the time I have insomnia and non-burning reflux. I suppose I'm just venting, but this shit really sucks right now.

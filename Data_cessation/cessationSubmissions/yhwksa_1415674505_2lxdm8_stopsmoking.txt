Finally Time To Quit.

So, I started smoking on Thanksgiving of 2011. I've recently noticed the toll it's been taking on my health (wheezing, slower at running, etc.) and I'm not in the greatest financial place. So I've decided it'd be best to improve my health and my financial situation by quitting. The last pack or two hasn't tasted/felt as good as it has before so I bid you adieu, cigarettes!

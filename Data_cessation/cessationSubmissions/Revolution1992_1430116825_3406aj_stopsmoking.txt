Almost relapsed after 3 years of no smoking...

I was traveling back to school tonight, and I stopped at a gas station to get something to drink before getting on the interstate. I went to the counter like normal. Not a thought of smoking at this point. All of a sudden, I start staring at the cigarettes. Specifically, Marlboro reds; that's what I used to smoke for the better part of 5 years. Suddenly, I had this insatiable desire to have a cigarette tonight.  I have no idea why.  So I blurted out that I wanted a pack of those also.  Knowing that I seemed sort of conflicted, I joked with him that I shouldn't but oh well. He seemed to encourage me, mentioning that he smokes also. So I buy the pack and go back to my apartment. I get settled in and decide to go out and have a cigarette. But when it came down to it, I became very, very conflicted. I firet decided that I would take out one cigarette, and crush the rest of the pack. So I did that.  After doing it, I decided to crush the one I pulled out also. I'm pretty happy about it and wanted to tell somebody. Keep it up guys!

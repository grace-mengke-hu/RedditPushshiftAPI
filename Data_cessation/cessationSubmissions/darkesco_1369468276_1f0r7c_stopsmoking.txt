I was afraid of this

Over 7 weeks without a smoke and I am starting to get more and more cravings for cigarettes. I used Chantix and it was a breeze to quit and I had maybe 2 minor cravings during the entire 3 or 4 weeks I was on Chantix. But now that I haven't been on Chantix in over 3 weeks, I am starting to get cravings. I got one or two last week. I got 2 cravings yesterday, and I've had about 5 today. The cravings are getting stronger exponentially, I am having a craving right now and will ignore it, but has anyone been through this? does it ever stop. I'm actually considering jumping back on the Chantix. But I don't trust Chantix either. I have classes coming up along with work projects and blah blah etc... This sucks!

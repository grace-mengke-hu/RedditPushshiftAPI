Advice for how to deal with friends?

I have recently really been trying to quit but I have a huge problem, my friends. I have only been smoking for about a year and I smoke about 5 cigs a day. The hard part is all of my best friends are smokers and I feel like part of being friends with them involves hanging out and having a cig. The hardest part is to hang out with them and have them smoke right in front of me. 
Does anyone have any advice on what to do in this situation?

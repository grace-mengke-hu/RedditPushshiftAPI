Two packs a day for 15 years.

Hi all! I'd like to start by thanking you all so much for constantly being such a supportive community. I subbed a few months ago with the hope that it would inspire me and it hasn't really worked. 

Quick background: as the title says, I've been smoking two packs daily for a about 15 years, sometimes it's only a pack and a half, sometimes closer to three. I promised myself I would quit when I finished med school, but the time xame and passed. Last week I with a patient, and started to black out. It turns out I had a stroke. I have always had high blood pressure (see: sleep deprivation, hugh caffenine intake, genetics, smoking), but didn't know it had gotten quite so bad. Obviously, a life change needs to be made. 

Tomorrow starts my first day of my first attempt to quit. I really needed to write it down somewhere to make it feel more official. Tommorow is the day. I'm ready.

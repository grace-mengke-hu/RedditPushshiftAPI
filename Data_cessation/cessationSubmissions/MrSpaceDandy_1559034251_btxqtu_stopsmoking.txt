Not sure what happened

I've been a smoker for almost 4 years now ever since my sophomore year of college. I smoked about a pack a day give or take a few. 4 days ago I woke up and only had one cigarette left and for some reason I decided that it would be my last cigarette. I've held to it and haven't really experienced a craving. After I eat I feel very out of place not smoking a cigarette though to be honest. That was always my favorite time to smoke. I'm not sure what changed but I feel confident that I'll never smoke again. Headaches and insomnia are the two main withdrawal symptoms I've been feeling. Concentrating is also very difficult and I've been zoning out from time to time. I'm hopeful that I can finally get past all the shame I've felt for being stupid enough to start. Maybe this can be the start of a new chapter for me. Anyway wish me luck and if anyone needs to talk feel free to message me.

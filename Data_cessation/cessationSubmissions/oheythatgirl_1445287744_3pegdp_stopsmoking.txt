Day 5 of 30 Day Smoke Free Challenge

I started a 30 day smoke free challenge with a friend. My thinking was that if I can make it 30 days, I probably won't want to smoke after that and easily do another 30. Personally, I find the idea of never, ever smoking again to feel a little overwhelming, even though that's how it needs to be for me. 

The terms of the challenge are:
1. No Smoking
2. All cessation aids are fair game (I am on the patch, he is doing accupuncture)
3. We are in touch if we are struggling 
4. If one of us slips, we write a 10,000 word essay on the other person's topic of choice, due in one week
5. The goal is to both succeed
6. When we make it 30 days, we have a fancy schmancy dinner together 

There have been SO many times in the last 5 days that I would have slipped, but didn't because I'm accountable to someone else and we have created a consequence. This is working really well, so I thought I would share the idea with the hopes that it might be useful for someone else, too.

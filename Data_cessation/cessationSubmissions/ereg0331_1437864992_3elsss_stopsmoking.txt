I didn't smoke!

There it was hidden away in the garage a whole unopened pack.  I stared them down.  I picked them up and slowly pealed back the sulafain.  I smelled them.  Then I started to go look for a lighter.  Something inside stopped me cold.  I broke them all and quickly tossed them in the outside garbage container.  Moving forward not backwards.

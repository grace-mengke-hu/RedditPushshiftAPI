So, I quit smoking and now I can smell my boogers..... Has this happened to anyone else?

Ok, I know thats a weird as shit title but I am not sure how else to put it.  I have heard your sense of smell comes back obviously but this is just strange.  I mean has this happened to anyone else?  I never even thought about boogers having a smell but they have to I guess.

It might be a side effect of something else?  When I quit i also started working out (woohoo!) and have been taking multivitamins, fish oil, digestive enzymes and protein shakes to bulk up and get in shape.  Could the smell be coming from that?  

I have no idea how to describe the smell, its not bad but its not good.  I don't smell it 24/7 but if I rub or dare I say it without a throwaway......PICK my nose I smell it.

So, anyone else?

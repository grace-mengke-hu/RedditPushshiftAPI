What are some things i should know before quitting ?

Hello,


So basically i started smoking around exactly 1 year ago, it was by a byproduct from my weed addiction i just really enjoyed the smoking aspect but didnt always wanna get high so i started smoking in the haze i was in at the time. About 4 months i stopped smoking weed and its going quite good but ever since i've been smoking a lot more. And i have to say i feel like ass. Today i have decided that i need to stop smoking. So i want to ask you if there are any things i should watch out for to succeed quitting. I am also interested in your expierences with quitting.

thankd and have a good day :)

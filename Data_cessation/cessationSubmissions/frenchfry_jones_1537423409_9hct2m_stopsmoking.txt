Successfully quit for 3 months while in a relationship. That ended and now I'm back to buying packs.

It amazes me how easy it was to not smoke with the positive influence of a significant other in the picture. It wasn't that he asked or encouraged me not to smoke, but rather that because he was a non-smoker I found that I didn't want to smell or taste like smoke whenever I was around him. My will power to not smoke revolved around him - whether I believed that or not at the time I'll never know, but I'm sure I convinced myself that I was doing it for me (as I do every time I try to quit).   
  
So now what? I'm back to daily smoking, one or two throughout the day, but without any will to avoid it. Back to where I was before the relationship. Does anyone have experience similar to this? Were you eventually able to quit?  
  
I should also note that since the breakup I have been going to the gym nearly every day. Also something that amazes me. Am hoping that as I get into more of a routine and keep pushing myself to make progress it will help me to cut the smokes out of my life...and do it for me.

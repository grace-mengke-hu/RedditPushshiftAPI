Still staying free. Having trouble getting a restful sleep due to anxiety. Suggestions?

Hi,

I have been having anxiety and trouble getting a restful sleep, lately. Of course, there have been cravings (anxiety was a major trigger for me) but I really want my freedom and have not relapsed.

I am getting very tired, physically and emotionally. I do manage to sleep a decent number of hours, but I have anxious dreams or nightmares and wake up tired. I am also either anxious or unfocused during several hours every day.

Suggestions?

When I exercise, I do feel better, but it only lasts for a couple of hours.

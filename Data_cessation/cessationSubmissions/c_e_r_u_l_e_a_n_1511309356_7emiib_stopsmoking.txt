Stopped smoking, switched to vaping

Gave up smokes in favor of vaping a few months ago. Gradually lowered the amount of nicotine until I was at zero. Been on zero for almost a month but, I still occasionally have a  cigarette when I'm in the mood for it. I don't buy them and I don't do more than one.  Sometimes I just want a small blast of nicotine.  Am I alone?

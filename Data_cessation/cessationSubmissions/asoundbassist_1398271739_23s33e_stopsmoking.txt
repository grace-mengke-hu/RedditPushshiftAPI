The Empty Attic

Disclaimer: I am not a religious man and I do not intend to turn this into a religious discourse. I also apologize if this turns into something lengthy.

With that out of the way, my recent failed attempt to quit smoking taught me something very valuable. I remembered something I had heard before and looked it up; turns out, it was from the book of Luke, chapter 11, verses 24-26:

“When an impure spirit comes out of a person, it goes through arid places seeking rest and does not find it. Then it says, ‘I will return to the house I left.’ When it arrives, it finds the house swept clean and put in order. Then it goes and takes seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they go in and live there. And the final condition of that person is worse than the first.”

I made it through the first couple of days just fine, but when I got home late yesterday evening, it was that time of night when things are quiet and it's time to get settled in for sleep. This is the time when my mind is most free and, therefore, prone to wander. I couldn't keep myself from thinking about how much I "wanted" a smoke. Eventually, I caved and bought a pack.

Going back to the aforementioned passage, I think it's an interesting concept that can be applied to smoking. When I make the decision to quit smoking, I cast the "evil" from my house and sweep it clean, but it remains empty and vulnerable, available for the little smoking monster when he's ready to return. I'm determined to learn from this and find productive, fulfilling ways to fill that void so I can light the "no vacancy" sign and keep moving forward.

So, friends, how do you fill your attic?

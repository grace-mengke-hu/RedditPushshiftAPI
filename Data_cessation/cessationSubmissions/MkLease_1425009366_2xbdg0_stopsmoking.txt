It's been a whole month!

I think I've finally done it. I stayed with the patch, 21mg and did that for a week. I forgot it one day, and it was the absolute worst. And I got stuck in traffic, during a snow storm. I wanted to stop at the nearest gas station and give in. I didn't stop, nor did I put a patch on the next day. My poor girlfriend put up with me being the biggest asshole ever for a week before she told me I was almost acting normal again. I've been smoke free for one month, and nicotine free for three weeks. I'm feeling pretty damn good about it. To everyone else out there quitting, keep it up. You can do it.

Just finished reading EASYWAY

Hey all.  Im not a big poster on here, but I just wanted to share this with you all (I'm sure its been said a thousand times already on here). I've just finished reading Allen Carr's EASYWAY and I'm currently feeling optimistic.  Something I've never felt after putting out my 'last' cigarette before 'quitting'.

Over the last year I thought I was making huge progress, I stopped smoking cigarettes from November 12 through til November 13, but I've been really technically cheating.  I've been a heavy cannabis user for the last 8 years and never failed get through the day without having a few spliffs/joints at the end of the day.  In the UK its really common to use cigarettes with the cannabis, so I've really been getting my nicotine though that.  I've convinced myself over the years that it was the lack of cannabis that was giving me the mood swings and depression.  

I started smoking again 2 weeks ago after hearing of a family member passing a way whilst in work.  It didn't take me long to get back in to the swing of things and hated myself for it.

Anyway I started EASYWAY 4 days ago now after a recommendation from a friend in work and not had a spliff since day 2 and really optimistic about the coming future.

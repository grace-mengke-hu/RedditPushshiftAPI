Determined this time.

It's been about 24 hours since my last cigarette and I want to hold myself accountable this time. I quit smoking cold turkey May of 2012 and started right back up again after an ugly end to a terrible relationship. Being deployed in a country where cigarettes are hard (but not impossible) to come by, I figure now is the best time to change my lifestyle again. Any advice would be greatly appreciated and kudos to everyone here for bettering themselves as well.

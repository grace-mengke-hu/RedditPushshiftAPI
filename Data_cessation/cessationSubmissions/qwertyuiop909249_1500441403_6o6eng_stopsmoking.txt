20 years old, been smoking for 3 years, quit 5 days ago

I'm enjoying everything about it. When I used to eat drunk all I would want to do is be outside chain-smoking. I got wasted yesterday with friends who were all chain-smoking and I felt no desire to smoke. I could fully enjoy the drunk without constantly needing more. When I'm high, I don't need to add something dirty to bring my high down. Its almost a full 5 days for me and I have no plans on turning back. Good luck to everyone else :)

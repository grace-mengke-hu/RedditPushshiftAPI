Four days!

Call me a cliche but I quit smoking for New Years. I’m 39 and have smoked every day for a long time. I’ve wanted to stop many times - it’s obvious that I don’t enjoy it anymore and probably haven’t for ages. It’s a compulsion.  I’ve also stupidly conned myself into thinking that it’s part of my identity. Bollocks to that. 

Cravings have been hard to deal with but after four days I feel great and am proud of myself. I know it’s not much of a milestone but hey, one day, one moment at a time right?

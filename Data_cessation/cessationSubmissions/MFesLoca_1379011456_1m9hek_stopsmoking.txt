Planning to Avoid Relapse

I quit smoking (again) on Monday using nicotine patches. I've smoked on and off---though mostly on---for the past nine years. In the past I have successfully quit for six months and, more recently, for eight months. It seems that around that time I get lulled into the false---and foolish---sense that I can have just one or two when I'm out with friends or something.

I know this isn't true. I know to be successful I have to fully commit to never, ever touching the things again. I'm wondering how you guys fight the part of your that wants to rationalize "just one" when you're confident in the fact that you have quit. I'm hoping better planning early will prevent this from happening again. It has to.

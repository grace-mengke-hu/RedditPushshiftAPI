Failing a bit

After month and half clean. I was at a store parking lot and a friendly looking guy was smoking. I asked for a cigarette and he gave me one. I smoked. Newport. I used to smoke that.

I was a bit dizzy. Felt very sick about 10 minutes later. Nicotine OD. I was okay after about 30 mins after that. I lied down in the car.

Reset i guess.

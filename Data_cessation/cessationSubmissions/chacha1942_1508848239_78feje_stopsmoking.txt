Day 9 - trouble focusing / any advice?

For several days now I've noticed I've spent a ton of time on my phone - Instagram/Reddit/FB.  I would imagine I would be astounded to learn just how much time has been spent there.

My logical mind says that this is par for the course and to just remain committed to not smoking, but I'm concerned about replacing an addiction with another addiction. 

For what it is worth, I stopped smoking cigarettes and weed on the same day, 9 days ago.

Does anyone have any guidance?

"I'm not used to seeing you on the back porch anymore"

I was outside letting my dog out. I usually would sit here for hours just smoking and drinking. I stopped doing that since I've quit. Tonight I decided to just relax outside. My neighbor came out and said "I'm not used to seeing you on the back porch anymore." Definitely made my night.

Starting my road to freedom today.

Hi everyone.
(not native English-speaking and on mobile, sorry for bad format) 

To start off, I want to say that I feel really stupid. I mean REALLY stupid. 
I have smoked since I was 15 years old and I'm 33 now, so I have poisoned myself for 18 years. 
I've owned Allen Carrs book EASYWAY for at least 5-6 years and I have now spent the last 2
 weeks reading this book, and I am almost crying.
I was so scared of that book, because it meant that I would commit myself to a hard road of pain.
But now I see how wrong I've been, because I've always thought that I didn't have the strength to do this, that I was weak.
It almost feel religious. 

What finally made me read the book was that my fiance is pregnant. (yay! :D) 
I grew up in a home with smokers and I don't want my child to do the same.
But it became more then that.
I started to feel an urge to stop smoking for no one else but me.
I want to be free. I don't want the poison.
I have never been more sure for anything in my life.

I will never light up a cancer-stick ever again.

Thanks for reading my ramblings!

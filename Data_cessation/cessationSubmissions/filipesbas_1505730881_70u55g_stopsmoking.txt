Reverse effects of smoking - Foods and plants.

Good people, former smokers, brothers in arms. I was a smoker on and off, for over 15 years (17 to 33). I lost count of all the times I got back to smoking (a legal form of suicide) after quitting for periods of a week, a month, 3 months, etc. When partying, clubbing, and socialising i could turn into a chain smoker and this worries me now, a lot. To make things worse I recently heard two of my parents acquaintances died, both in their 50s, from smoking related lung cancer.

I haven't smoked for over a year and few months (stopped being stupid) and now I have been looking for medicinal plants/herbs that have **valid** claims for reversing cigarette damage. 

Does anyone can help me with this search, paleaseee? Online I found dubious articles claiming flavonoids, vitamin A and other fruits and vegetables can reverse smoking damage and prevent lung cancer and other pulmonary complications. Any reference to a randomised, blinded and placebo controlled clinical study would be **much** appreciated.

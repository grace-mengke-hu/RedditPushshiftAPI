Trying to stop again - have a few questions

I'm quite a heavy smoker, I smoke strong cigarettes and I smoke a lot of them. I quit smoking and was completely smoke-free for four years, but during a stressful period of my life a few months ago, I started again, and at the same time stopped going to the gym and became a couch potato.

I'd like to stop again and hit the gym as well, but unlike the last time I managed to quit, this time I don't seem to have enough motivation to do it - ego depletion is the correct phrase. However, I'd like to get back on track and, coughing, waking up with a headache and not being able to do anything physical without hearing my heart pumping don't appeal to me in the least.

So, I have a few questions for those of you who have successfully blown over the withdrawal:

 - What could I use to distract myself? Eating seems like one good idea, as I've lost a lot of weight due to smoking.
 - Nicotine patches (24mg over 16 hours) barely seem to take the edge off - is it a good idea to use two patches, one 24mg and one smaller, something like 8mg?
 - Is it safe to start training again right away, even though I cough, get tired and light-headed quite easily?

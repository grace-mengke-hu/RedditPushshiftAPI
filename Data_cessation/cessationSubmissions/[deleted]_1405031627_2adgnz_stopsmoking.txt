8 days - Need help with stress triggers

This will be my 4th time quitting, my most successful period was 6 months before I had "just one cig" in May, and the same thing happened again 8 days ago. I've thrown out that pack and want to focus on truly bettering myself. 

As with every time I quit, I'm fully committed to quitting, but I am anxious about what has caused me to fail before. For me, that has to mean that success lies in logically attacking the triggers that lead me back into the habit.

I started smoking in college as a stress reliever. I'm now 23, working a full-time job as a designer in NYC, and I have a wonderful supportive girlfriend - she also wants to help where she can. There's a lot of pressure to succeed not just for her, but also at my job, and I feel strong triggers because of that stress - and even the stress of daily life at times. I'm just starting out in my career and on my own so I can sometimes feel overwhelmed. However, I'm getting better at remembering that nicotine isn't what made me succeed up to this point. It was a crutch all along, preventing me from focusing on success, compelling me to prioritize it over everything. Thinking about this helps the urge but not the stress.

What I used to do is use a cig as a "carrot on a stick" for getting through rough patches, but I want to approach how I absorb and manage stress differently. What are your tips?

Is it possible to blast away how stress negatively impacts my thoughts and actions without using an awful chemical? 

I'm able to see the initial impulse to cave in for what it is - plain bad advice from an old shitty friend. 
One thing I've noticed is that when I sleep, nap, or meditate more during a day, the urge to listen to it is weaker throughout the whole day. What other cheap, healthy habits have you picked up to reduce stress?

Thanks and good luck to everyone here!

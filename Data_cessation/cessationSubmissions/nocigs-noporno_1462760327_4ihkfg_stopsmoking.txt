Having a hard day.

Family get together are fun and suck at the same time.  I still feel my anxiety.  My head hurt to.  I am thinking about smoking right now.  Smoking would be bad to start again.  This has to be one of my biggest urges to smoke yet.  I can't get over today.  I feel all pent up.  Alright thats about it tho.  This sub sucks too.  Thanks

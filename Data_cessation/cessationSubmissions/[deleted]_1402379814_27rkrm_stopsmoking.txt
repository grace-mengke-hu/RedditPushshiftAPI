New smoker thinking of quitting

Hello there,

I am in my mid 20s, and I recently picked up smoking over a month ago to deal with stress, depression, and frustration, and so far I have smoked at least a pack (I'm pretty sure more than that), as I tend to share a pack with my brother. 

Anyway, over the past week, I've been smoking upwards of 8 cigarettes per day. I also tend to smoke two cigarettes, one after the other, for the past two days. I also seem to swallow the smoke and burp it up after smoking. I have smoked up to 8 today (lost count).

I don't know if I have an addiction, but I've noticed myself somewhat 'feeling' like it and the 'slight' cravings. At times, I don't, and simply just go out to smoke because I enjoy it.

I'm starting to have doubts about it being a good idea to use it to deal with emotional issues, and now I'm wondering if I have created a dependency and an addiction, so I'm thinking of dropping it before it becomes a full blown habit/addiction.

Should it be hard for me to quit as a relatively 'new' smoker? Would my brain and nervous system get used to cigarettes after a month and make it hard for me, giving me cravings and other challenges?

Thank you.

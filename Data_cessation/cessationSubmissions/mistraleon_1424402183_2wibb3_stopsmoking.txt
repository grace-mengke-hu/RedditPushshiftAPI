Dawn of the 3rd day.

I'm doing well so far, had some slight headaches but they've managed to pass.

One issue that I've yet to tackle is trying not to smoke in the place where I used to smoke the most (army). I have to book in on Saturday for some duties, and returning to an old place filled with smokers seems very daunting all of a sudden.

I hope I have the strength to pull through.

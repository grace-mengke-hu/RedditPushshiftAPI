277 days later..

it's been a solid 3-4 months with no cravings. I can stand with my friends as they smoke with no interest. I can go to bars again with no interest. I went from thinking about having a cigarette at LEAST a few times a day to maybe once a day, to once a week to nothing. I know for some people it takes more time, some still think of smoking long after but I just wanted to offer my experience because I thought it would take me way longer to get over the cravings. It was painful for a bit but the payoff is amazing. you can BREATHE! it feels GREAT!

coming back to check out this subreddit made me remember all the times I came here to read success stories and get some fresh inspiration to keep on it so thanks everyone and I hope this helps someone keep going. :)

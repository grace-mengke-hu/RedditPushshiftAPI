I have a 3! I HAVE A 3!

I've never gotten this far before!  OHMYGOSH!



I sometimes catch myself wanting a cigarette, but then I remember that I have a new puppy to look after and I wouldn't have time for a smoke break because I have to keep an eye on her almost 24/7.



I told my Gramma about it, and she was so proud of me!  My Gramma told me, she was proud!  I cried, I just cried I was so happy :'D  She used to smoke when she was younger, and then she quit cold turkey when my Grampa had his heart surgery (he had to quit smoking or they wouldn't perform the surgery), so they quit together.  I made her proud...  I'll never forget that.



Thank you, thank you everyone for posting your inspiring words of wisdom, your quotes/quips/queries, pictures, and even your admissions of guilt.  Even if you slip up (I did; I actually quit on the 9th and I slipped up on the 17th), you can still give it another go.



Never give up, never surrender.

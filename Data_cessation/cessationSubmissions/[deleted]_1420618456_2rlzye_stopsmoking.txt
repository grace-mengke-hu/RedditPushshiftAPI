Has it been that long? I kind of lost track :)

Seriously, it gets a lot easier as time goes by. I remember fighting urges and checking my progress almost daily to see how long I've quit. Now smoking doesn't even cross my mind even when I see others smoke. You can do it too. And it feels so fucking good, I can do shit again, although not as I would if I haven't smoked at all I'm sure.

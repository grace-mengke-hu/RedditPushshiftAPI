Relapsed temporarily. Resetting the badge.

Here's my original post.

I lasted from June 16th to September 7th, 2017. However, due to some stress caused by my breakup (see my posts on r/BPDlovedones for stories on that mess) I had been smoking again (intermittently) for the past 3 weeks. The mindfuck that was my BPD/DID "relationship" had left me with a bit of a hole to fill. Unfortunately, the temptation of nicotine was the easiest escape.

I had a gentlemen's excursion to Maine over this past weekend, and I knew that it was time to draw a line. I said, "let this be a cleansing time" and I once again have sworn off cigarettes. I tend to compartmentalize and need to draw clear, clean lines. It worked for the initial quit, so I'm returning to the well.

Smoking again reminded me that it's truly not worth it. I did it more out of "stress relief" habit than true stress relief, as I know deep down that it ~causes~ stress. Now I can continue the journey that I began back in June, no compromises. Never say never (sad but true as I now know) but after the ordeal that was my summer... I would love to continue improving myself. Rediscovering myself.

Don't give up, folks. [resets badge]

Success story checking in!

After smoking for 17 years, I smoked my last cigarette just before midnight on 8/31/17, and I still haven’t taken a drag since! In March, I found out I was pregnant (surprise!), and that helped motivate me to give up vaping as well. So for the first time since I was 16 years old, I am 100% nicotine free! 

It does get much easier with time, but there is always voice inside of me that occasionally speaks up wanting a cigarette. I just remind myself how far I have made it, and I don’t want to give in now. Now I’m just looking forward to welcoming my baby boy into a safe, healthy home! (Hopefully like tomorrow, because being this pregnant is a bitch...)

Anyway, just wanting to check in because this community definitely helped me when I was first quitting. I wish you all the best, because you CAN conquer this. Stay strong!

Back to square one.

So, last February I tried quitting. I maintained for about 2 weeks straight (and actually felt significantly healthier), but eventually succumbed when I started going out again.

Lately I've been trying to quit again, but I always find myself making excuses. Just had a greasy meal, going for drinks tonight, working tomorrow (I'm a bartender - doesn't help the quitting process), etc.

But at some points in my life reality smacks me across the face, like this morning when I was laying half-awake, tugging on my cigarette before even getting out of the bed to eat, stinking up my room, furniture and clothes. It was a moment where I could make the decision to continue this lifestyle like the past few years, or get up and go to my Jiujitsu class which I've been postponing for a while now. I went for the latter, and I did resist the urge to buy a pack on my way there.

I'll be trying to get my shit together again, avoiding smoking, attending exercise classes and rejecting junkfood. Back to square one, but trying to move forward nonetheless.

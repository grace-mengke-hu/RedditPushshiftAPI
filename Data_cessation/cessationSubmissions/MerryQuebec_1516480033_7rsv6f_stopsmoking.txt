One Year Tomorrow

I'm particularly proud because I have been through so much change in the past year, and I haven't broken.  I've had so much stress, lost friends, went back to school, moved, lost my grandmother, distanced myself from toxic family, started working out, battled depression, ended a bad "friends with benefits" situation, and who the fuck can remember what else.

I am not sure where I'll be tomorrow, or if anyone will be there to celebrate with me.  I thought I should post here in the hopes that I could get some inspiration from all of you to keep pushing to be better.  It's been so hard, and no one can understand that like the people in the sub.  You guys have helped me get to this point, so thank you.

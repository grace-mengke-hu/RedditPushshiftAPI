It’s been a week!

And not only a week, but a really good week, at that. I had a few bad cravings and a bit of cattiness towards my other half for the first day or so, but after that I’ve been doing really well! I even went out drinking last weekend (after two days quitting) and didn’t smoke, even though the urge was there, and plenty of my smoker friends were there too. 

I really just hated smoking, I guess. The few weeks before I made the decision, I had a very tight chest and my energy level was decimated, and every time I smoked the taste was like eating pure ashtray. I know I’ve made the right decision for myself.

This isn’t my first time trying to quit - I’ve lasted almost a whole year once before, so I know I’m nowhere near safe. I thought I wouldn’t be able to muster the willpower this time, but willpower is all about believing you can achieve your goal, and I believe I can do this. Hopefully if I make it months down the line, I won’t forget how awful smoking makes me feel.

Hey guys, i already stopped, but i want to prevent relapse.

It's been more than a year, but man when i feel down and sad and things are just not going my way i think about them old cigarettes. Please somebody tell me that smoking cigarettes will make my dick stop working in ten years or stuff like that, because i fear i will relapse, maybe not today or this year, but someday.

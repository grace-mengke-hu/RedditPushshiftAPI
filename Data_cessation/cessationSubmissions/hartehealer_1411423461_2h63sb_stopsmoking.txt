Quitting now

I posted my first thread in this subreddit about setting a quit date and since the post I've been thinking nervously and somewhat excitedly about reaching Sunday and my first official day as a non-smoker. However, after seeing in other threads mentions of Allen Carr, his book and the video, and a suggestion in my previous thread, I finally watched the video.

I'm throwing away my pack and going to pick up the missions from the Smoke Free app (which was helpful during my last attempt) and rid my home, car, and purses of all things related to smoking.

I have my motivation and tonight I'm going to outline the things I can do in the moments where the craving hits and keeps me distracted. My main challenge is finding activities to keep my mind off a craving when I'm at my job as a barista, when I'm given breaks, which has always been the immediate moment I smoke my third or fourth cigarette of the day (depending on how many I've had before heading to work). Any suggestions? (most of my breaks only last 10 minutes so it can't be a time consuming activity -- reading is time consuming for me so it's not a great alternative).

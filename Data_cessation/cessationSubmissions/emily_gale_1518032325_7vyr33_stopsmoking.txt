Checking in after 6 months!

The date passed me by, which I can’t even believe. 
This sub was such a help to me in the beginning hours, days, weeks, and months so I just wanted to come back and say thank you for helping me along on this journey. 

My two favorite things I’ve gotten to experience as a non-smoker are :

• My grandma is a kiss-on-the-lips to say goodbye kind of woman. I stopped for 8 years and barely hugged her for fear she would smell that I was a smoker, as I “hid” it from everyone. I can now embrace my favorite person on the planet again without shame. 
• Getting set up with a primary care physician for a physical and filling out the paperwork — checking the “non smoker” box. Hearing his praise when asked if I smoke. 

If you’re afraid of taking the leap, it’s okay! But it will be one of the most rewarding decisions of your life!

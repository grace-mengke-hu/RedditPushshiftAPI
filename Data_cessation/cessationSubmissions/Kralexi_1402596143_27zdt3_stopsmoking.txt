Quitting smoking with IBS

Hi all,

Wondering if there are any others out there who are quitting, or have quit, who also suffer from IBS.

I primarily suffer from IBS-D, triggered by spicy/greasy/acidic foods (so I've cut that pretty much out, although stress is also a huge trigger) but after some attempts to see how well I could do going cold turkey (so far...success! Not 100% so I haven't really fully quit, but I'm looking forward to really going for it on my set date to quit)...I now have constipation.

It's killing me; stomach pain just adds to my stress, and if I have any at all, after suffering with IBS for so many years, it already psychologically impacts me such that it makes any attacks worse.

Right now, I can't go to the bathroom after yet another of my 24hr cold turkey "practice" days and have only just recently (literally today) truly started to suffer from the constipation side effect. I don't know what to do. I have all of the aids (whether juice or otherwise) that I typically drink/eat to keep me regulated due to the IBS to begin with, but I haven't been able to go for several hours. It's leading me to panic (which is typical of my attacks to begin with) and I'm quite disheartened.

I think I'm just looking for support here or any other home remedies that others with experience can offer advice with. How have you been able to cope with that? I understand that intestinal trouble can last around 1 - 2 months from what I've read/been told, and I'd like to have a real plan of action of what to do that I haven't already pieced together myself.

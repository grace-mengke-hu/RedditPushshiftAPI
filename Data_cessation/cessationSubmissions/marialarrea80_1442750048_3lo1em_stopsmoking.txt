First 7 days without cigarettes ever!

And feel semi proud, still craving quite a lot, angry and irritable, tired, sad... Hope it gets better this second week! I'm saving all the money to treat myself when I feel proud. Not yet! I'm happy a sis the first time ever I haven't given a puff on 7 days. I did stop before but always cheated here and there. Not this time. On Friday I had a glass of red wine, the worst thing I could do as needed to smoke straight away! I have switched off to lager. Good luck everyone! We can do this! ðŸ’ªðŸ’ª

Just thought I'd share a tip that might work for some people who need to keep their hands busy!

Sounds a bit strange, but I found that having a little bit of blu tack (or something similar) to roll around my fingers helped out for the initial weeks. It is definitely less noticeable than replicating smoking with a pen or a rolled up bit of paper. Might not work for everyone, but I thought I'd put it out there!

Quitting for my cat

Anyone else here draw motivation from others? Ziggy is going to be my prime motivation - he loves me more than i love myself so I'm going to be the person my cat would want me to be :) plus the whole passive smoke thing really disturbs me, if Ziggy lives with a smoker that's seriously bad news for his little lungs. I have exposed him to enough evil poison and enough's enough.

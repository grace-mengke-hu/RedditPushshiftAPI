Quit smoking (4days) ... but still using nicotine inhalers and E-cigarettes.

So it's been 4 days since I quit smoking (15 day) and I feel great! 

My smell and taste has improved and my breathing is fantastic and improved alot! 
Although I'm wondering I really want all nicotine out of my body, will this be an easy or hard task? I'm not addicted to E cigarettes or the inhalers I just use them sometimes to take the edge off. 

Really need this next step! Advice will go really appreciated.

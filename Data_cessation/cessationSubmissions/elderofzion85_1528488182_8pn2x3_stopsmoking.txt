Tell me it gets worse.

Hi all,

So after 15 years of a 25 a-day habit I decided to quit.

 I'm currently on day 3 and so far it been ridiculously easy, too easy, so easy I'm actually a bit pissed off I haven't tried this before. Surely it's going to get harder?

 I'm genuinely staggered by how mild the withdrawal symptoms are (so far). On Monday I was a guy who nipped out of a restaurant for a cigarette between finishing his food and paying the bill, on Friday I'm 3 days clean and haven't suffered at all.

Has anyone got any experience with this? I'm almost feeling uneasy, like I'm doing it wrong, every thread I read  has this 'grit your teeth and persevere' feel to it and I'm unsure as to why my experience is so different?

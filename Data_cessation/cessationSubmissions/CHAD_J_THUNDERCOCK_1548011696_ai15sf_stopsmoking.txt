Quit 5 weeks ago cold turkey. Haven't thought about smoking in a week

I was not as addicted as many of you. I had socially smoked for 5 years. Last Summer I started smoking twice a day, 8-16 cigarettes a day, everyday, for months. But I became very dependent on the cigarettes and had a very tough time at work for 4 weeks when I quit as I had no dopamine/motivation at all.

Day 5 was the hardest day. Week 2 and 3 were hardest weeks. 

I am genetically predisposed to have an addictive personality and I took up 'The Witcher 3'. I do not have the time to be playing video games really, but it really took the edge off wanting to smoke. I immersed myself in that game for all my spare free time since Christmas. Its a safe form of dopamine replacement - because all games eventually get boring.

I felt a depression when I recently completed Witcher 3. But it just occurred to me I've not thought about smoking in a week. The hard part is over. I just cant ever social-smoke again.

I used to read this sub a lot when I quit. It helped so much to read what other people said. When I was on a night out and drunk and got some bad ideas I always had you people in my pocket to tell me reasons to not smoke.

I'll probably keep coming back but wanted to share my life-hack for reclaiming some dopamine in a safe way.

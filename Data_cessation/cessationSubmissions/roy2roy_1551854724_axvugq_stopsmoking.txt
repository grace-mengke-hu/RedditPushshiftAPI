Replaced one addiction with another. Oops.

I quit smoking a little under 2 months ago. Obviously still in that danger zone for me (Still get cravings, esp. as a college student studying constantly). I used to smoke while studying and obviously don't do that now, so instead I've been drinking insane amounts of coffee. Like 3-4 big cups from coffee shops a day. 

Obviously I'll take this over smoking but sheesh.. I'll have to get that in control sooner or later. But till then I pat myself on the back for every day I go smoke free.

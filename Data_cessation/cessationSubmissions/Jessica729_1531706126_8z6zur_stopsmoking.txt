11 days smoke free

Cold turkey too no cessation aid I am so proud it’s honestly mostly mind over matter I have been shaking and sweating loads due to nicotine withdrawal it definitely gets much easier the longer you’re smoke free.

Anyone else that wants to go cold turkey you can do it believe it think of the health benefits :3

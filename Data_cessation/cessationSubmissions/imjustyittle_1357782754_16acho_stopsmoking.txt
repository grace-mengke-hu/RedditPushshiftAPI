Getting Ready to Quit

Gonna quit smoking 1/11 after > 35 yrs. Think I'll lurk about this subreddit... I have chronic pain; some of my drs have said (in the past) now is not the time to quit due to pain issues. But I figure, if not now - when? Husband smokes & has COPD. I had cancer in 2002. Got some patches & plenty of motivation.  Wondering if it's okay to use patches & occasional nicotine gum simultaneously...

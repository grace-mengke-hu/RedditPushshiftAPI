21 days in. I survived!

I've attempted quitting multiple times in the last year with 92 days being the longest.  This time around, the first couple of weeks were relatively easy, but around day 16 I got hit with some of the worst withdrawals I've ever had in terms of insomnia, anxiety, and crippling depression.  I don't typically struggle with any of these so it was a bit of a shock.  I came very close to buying a pack but ultimately didn't, because I knew one puff would lead me right back.  I think it must have been the  "Three's" of quitting smoking (3 days/weeks/months).  So anyway, I don't have a point but hang in there and it will get better eventually.

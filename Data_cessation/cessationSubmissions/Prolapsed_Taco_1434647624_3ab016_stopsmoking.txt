Just put the patch on! Any advice for the rough first week?!

Hey all! I've been lurking for awhile now, and you seem to have a great support group going on here. I am trying to quit for like the third time. I had over a year and started again in November. I'm an idiot, I know. I love running, and cannot do that whilst being a smoker. It just doesn't work for me. I also have 3 tiny humans I would like to stay around for! First time using the patch, the last two times I went cold turkey. I don't think I can do that this time. Any advice on getting through the first week? I am still around smokers which is going to be tough, but I cannot really escape it. Thanks so much! HAPPY QUITTING!!!!

Edit: had to take the patch off, was making me nauseas. So cold turkey it is!!!

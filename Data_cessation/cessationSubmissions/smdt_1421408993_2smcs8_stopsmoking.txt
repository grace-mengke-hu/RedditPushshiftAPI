HELP going out and not smoking

I've been smoking since I was 14/15, so all my adult life. I quit 15 days ago and its going really well. I am a student and I have exams atm so havent really had a chance to test it when I am out with friends (all of whom smoke) either at a club or at the pub. I am terrified that after a few drinks I will smoke (and there's no such thing as 'just smoking when i'm out' tried that one before! before I knew it I was smoking 20 a day) or that if I dont smoke I wont enjoy it because so much of our going out rituals revolve around smoking.

Any advise? I'm terrified!

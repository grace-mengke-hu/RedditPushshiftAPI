I've been planning to quit for ages, today I actually took a step towards it, any advice to keep my resistance strong is much appreciated.

As in the title, I've always been excellent at planning, terrible at execution. However, for some strange reason my NY resolutions have stuck with me thus far, I've quit smoking weed, i've been doing cardio and lifting weights, eating more healthily, keeping my personal spaces clean and organised. Smoking has been something I've found nearly impossible to quit, however with the buzz i've gotten from making so many positive steps and a raging cardio high I threw my pack in the bin and covered it in yesterdays spaghetti-o's. This was seven hours ago, and I'm feeling good so far, I'm just desperate for it to stick, scared I haven't got the willpower to make this change stick and terrified if I renege on this then I might renege on the progress I've made so far.

Just hoping those who've gotten through this, or can relate to it, can share some wisdom, advice or warn about pitfalls or triggers I haven't thought of.

Thank you for taking the time to read.

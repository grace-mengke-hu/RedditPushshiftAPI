4 days. Nicotine gum is helping i think.

So, i stopped smoking 4 days ago, and downloaded the app smoke free and bought premium membership. Very good app it helps a lot. Somebody had a spare nicorette because she stopped smoking so she gave me one pack witb 10 gums i think. I devoured it in 2 days and now that i dont have it anymore definitely slowed the cravings down. It used to kill the cravings too, so if u guys need something to kill cravings for sure and dont wanna smoke that 1 cig, try the gum!

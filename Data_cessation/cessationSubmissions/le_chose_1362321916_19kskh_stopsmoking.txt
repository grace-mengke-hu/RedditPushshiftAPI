Feel like I'm gonna die.

Went to bed yesterday and had several adrenaline rush like that make me bolt in bed and even yell "F***". I had sleep apnea before(stop breathing while you sleep) but now this seems different since I am not gasping for air when I wake up, just a terrible feeling/boost of adrenaline out of nowhere when I fall asleep. I feel horrible and have 7 cigarettes left. I have all the nicotine replacement think that I can think of by my side and some motivational text with good advice to stop cold turkey. Going through a break up and still live with my ex-girlfriend. I really don't feel good. Might give a shot at stopping today. Thank you for reading and congratulations to all of you. 

EDIT: flushed the last 5 cigs and stick a patch, wish me luck.

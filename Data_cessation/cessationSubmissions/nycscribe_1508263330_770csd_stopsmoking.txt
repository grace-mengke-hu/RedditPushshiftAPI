Coming Up on 9 Years ... A Few Things I Learned

Hi everyone. Just discovered this sub in the process of helping a friend who has decided to quit smoking. I've been smoke-free since November 13, 2008, so my 9-year anniversary is just a few weeks away. 

Some backstory: I smoked on and off from 1999, the year I turned 18, to 2008. Twice during that stretch, I quit for a year before relapsing. When I did smoke, I didn't mess around: I smoked a pack a day and, at my worst, a pack and a half. I was the heaviest smoker anyone knew. 

I tried everything I could to quit. My mother paid for hypnotherapy, which got me off cigarettes for a year. I used the patch â€” multiple times. I tried Cold Turkey. I tried to substitute with all sorts of things. Vaping didn't exist then, but I have no doubt that I'd have tried that, too.

What eventually worked was Allen Carr's Easy Way to Quit Smoking. Carr was the first person who explained smoking to me in terms I could understand; namely, that there's no reason it should be difficult to quit smoking. It clicked for me. I stopped and have never come close to smoking ever since.

Over the last several years, I've helped numerous others quit smoking for good. A few common denominators:

1. Most had wrestled with the decision to quit for some time and weren't just making a decision based on a rough Saturday night out on the town.

2. Most had deliberately chosen to smoke their last cigarette.

3. Most had anticipated cravings and had built a mechanism for dealing with them, thereby making them easier.

4. Most felt an immense relief at quitting smoking rather than anxiety about it, despite dealing with the usual tremors.

5. Most can remember their quit date.

Hope some of you find this helpful!

I had my last one yesterday.

Today after 5 years smoking I quit. I've gotten in very good shape but my cardio sucks and I can no longer justify my habit. I hope I can inspire my sister to drop the habit as well as she is only a high schooler  and I don't want her to make my mistake.  Seeing all the success here I know I'll succeed. Lose it and fit helped me get where I am so again I'm relying on reddit to keep me motivated. Thanks and keep up the good work!

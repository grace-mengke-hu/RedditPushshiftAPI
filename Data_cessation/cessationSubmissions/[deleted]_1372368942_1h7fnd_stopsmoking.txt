Some random thoughts about smoking

First of all, hello!

I have(had) 11 years of heavy smoking. Started as a joke at 14 years-old and I accidentally the whole thing. For the first years my parents sustained the costs, after that, my job.

I'm from Eastern EU, and a pack here is around 3.2 Euros. That was the least of my problems. Starting from around 2009, well-know terrible symptoms started: awful taste, cough, sour chest, general fatigue, lazy lungs, weak smell sense etc. 

Now, time for some random rambling:

* Withdrawal lasts 3-5 days (AT MOST!), and after that you only have psychological cravings and old habits. Just watch some fucking movies or walk the dog if you feel irritated and have various nicotine withdrawal symptoms. 

* As most of you know, alcohol boosts your smoking hunger due to numbness, but the day after (say due to 2-3 packs) you really just want to die. Stay away from it for the first 1-2 weeks as it triggers some kind of voodoo cigarette-beer connection within the brain and you go nuts.

* Do some running/weight lifting in the first month. Personally, I want to puke after an hour of jogging if I get the scent of cigarette smoke. Works great. If you don't/can't exercise, eat some random fruits. Don't become a FAT FUCK by eating ice cream and KFC.

* Drink cold water. Remember, that summer is the BEST season to quit smoking due to large amounts of stuff you can do while you 'reset' your brain from cigs

* Start with the right mindset: "I am NOT going to smoke another cigarette for the rest of my days" does not help for some people.
It is too scary. Use the old trick that consists of quitting a day at a time(e.g I am not going to smoke today).

* Last week I met a 35-year old athlete in a train that had stage IV lung cancer and was going to doctor check. She never smoked in her life and she did not worked in a sulfur mine either. Think twice, but don't become a fucking hypochondriac.

* Since people are brain-washed by nicotine, we do not or we actually refuse to believe that we can get sick like our neighbors. We are immortal; until a random-cold turns out to be ...something else.

* We all want to quit, because we feel better, we know that cigarettes taste like shit; but hey, anything for that 15-second feeling at the beginning. All smokers feel like hell (smoker's depression) after they fail and start smoking again.

These things are probably well-known by many around here, but hope it helps for someone somewhere. These were my random thoughts.

Good luck, people!

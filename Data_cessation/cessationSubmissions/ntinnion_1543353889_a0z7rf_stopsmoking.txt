Techniques to manage stress without buying a pack of fags...

I’m a 25yo who has been smoking a pack of 20 every day for 10 years. I’m on day 8 of no smoking, cold turkey, and this is my first attempt. I’ve found it much easier than I was expecting however today has been the closest I’ve become from running into the busy smoking area at my office and screaming SOMEONE GIVE ME A CIGARETTE. 

I think my success so far is down to the fact I’ve tried to change my routine in small and manageable chunks which has made me think less and less about smoking, however I feel it’s days like today I hadn’t prepared for. It’s been particularly stressful at work with one thing after another going wrong, but also going right (I got a second interview for a promotion) but all the stress has made me want to smoke so so so bad. I used to love to have that time in the smoking area to gather my thoughts and make a plan of action but I feel I’m missing that now.

Thankfully I did cave but I really need a better way of managing it as I was so moody all afternoon and have been since I’ve gotten home. Has anyone got any tips on what to do when managing stress and not reaching for a smoke?

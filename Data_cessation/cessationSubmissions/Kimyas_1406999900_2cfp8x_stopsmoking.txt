Day 4 and I feel amazing

So, today is day 4 and I couldn't feel happier. And I think I faced a lot of social situations today, where I normally would've smoked like a hooker in prison. Lots of people,  smokers, alcohol and music, but I was just happy the way I was,  euphoric even!

I don't know how it clicked, and now, all I wonder,  why it took me so long to stop, and why I failed previously.

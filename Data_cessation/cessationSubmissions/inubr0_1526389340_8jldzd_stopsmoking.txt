It is either this or I'll burn up

Hello fellow quitters, hope this place will help me kick my nasty habit for good. I am a 3 to 4 pack a day smoker for 7 years now and I'd be willing to admit that I am far past smoking for the joy and have plunged into the smoking to die territory.

I am sick and tired of constant pain whilst breathing, struggling to eat anything and waking up almost choking until I get my fix. 

Just threw my last 9 packs into the blender and trashed them so I may not infect any one else with this parasitic addiction.

Good luck to all of you on this journey and to those just starting like me. Let's be better for ourselves and the people we love!

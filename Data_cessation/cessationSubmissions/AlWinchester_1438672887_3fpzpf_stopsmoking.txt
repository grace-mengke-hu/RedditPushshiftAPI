Social smoker here. Want to quit completely, can't do it.

Hello guys,

I started smoking in college. I was smoking one pack a day for 5 years. Then I decided to quit and started to exercise, healthy food.

And I did it, I'm not smoking one pack a day now. But I'm still smoking when I'm outside at a bar, with a few beers, at a football game, when hanging out on a Saturday night.

The quantity? It's 9-10 cigarettes a week. Some weeks 15. Generally on weekends. So it does count as a social smoker, am I wrong?

But I don't want it. I don't like its smell, I don't like the feeling that I feel while I'm doing my cardio on Monday. I want to quit completely, I want cigarette out of my life. 

But I can't do it. Part of me always says "what the heck, few cigarettes a week doesn't kill you". I need the strength to do it. 

What should I do? Any advice from you guys would be awesome for me. Thanks!

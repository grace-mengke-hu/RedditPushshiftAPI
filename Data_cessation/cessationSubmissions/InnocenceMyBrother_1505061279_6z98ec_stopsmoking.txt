How can I help my boyfriend with his goal to quit?

My boyfriend quit smoking normal cigarettes just before we met 9 months ago. He's been using an e cigarette since and quit that 3 days ago. He's been really stressed out and had a really rough time of it but is very determined to quit.

So my question is, as a significant other to someone quitting, what support and help can I offer to make it easier for him? I'm super proud of him for quitting and would also appreciate any ideas for small gifts or gestures to show that. 

Thanks!

"Let me smoke this last cigarette not in celebration, but to say goodbye to my one year struggle with the toxic friend I need no longer."

Those were the words I said tonight.

It's be one tough year, and tonight I AM FREE. No longer will I succumb to my toxic friend. And I hope these words help those struggling with the white demon, and that you shall overcome it with grace and strength. 

Sincerely, Dane

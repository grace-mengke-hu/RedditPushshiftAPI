Don't smoke, but I wanted to say...

Congratulations on taking steps to stop smoking – I've seen how that drug affects people, and I am **so glad** you are trying to quit. 

It might not seem like anyone notices or cares, but I honestly do. I think smoking is a terrible habit, and it makes me sad to see so many of my friends get addicted to tobacco. I wish they had as much willpower and determination as you do.

**Don't give up. You can do it.**

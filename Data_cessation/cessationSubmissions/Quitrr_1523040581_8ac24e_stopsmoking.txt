Day 47 benefits

I have smoked for 25 years and this is only the millionth time I have quit. I am committed to doing this and this site has really helped me as well as the Smoke Free app on my phone. It has been 47 days quit. I wanted to post a few benefits I have seen.

1. My smokers cough is dramatically better now.
2. Circulation has definitely improved (especially in the nether regions I was starting to develop ED and that is gone.)
3. Cravings are way less
4. I can go out to dinner or on a walk or anything with stressing about when I could get home and secretly smoke.
5. I don't have to hide it from my family anymore that I smoke
6. Using much less cologne as I am not trying to hide the fact

There are a whole bunch more positives but I wanted to post just a few as this site has been super helpful to me. A few negatives: my sleep is super jacked up and I am still having weird dreams. The first couple of weeks really sucked. To everyone quitting or getting ready to quit you can do it.

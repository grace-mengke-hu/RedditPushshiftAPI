Coming here for help

There seem to be plenty active members here, so I'm interested in some feedback. 

I'm 23 and started smoking around the age of 15. I've had addiction problems in the past, and obviously money is an issue, but my health is my main motivating factor. 

Lately I've been having tons of anxiety about my health. Worrying about heart disease, lung cancer, etc. wondering if I have any serious issues. 

I know I'm probably fine, but I need to quit or I won't be.

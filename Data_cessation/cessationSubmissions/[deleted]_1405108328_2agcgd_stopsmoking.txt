Moving to a different country made me quit smoking.

It's actually been 327 days since I quit smoking, I signed up here but never really kept track.

I just wanted to share my story, take from it what you will. I am just so happy to no longer be smoking.  

Started smoking around age 21 (started with weed actually), now 26, quit 327 days ago. I was on/off a lot of times but it basically came down to if I had a pack, I had to smoke it all asap, I have that type of addictive nature. I had no control.

I moved to a different country (Netherlands to USA) and it helped me quit instant from one day to another. The issue for me were the trigger moments. I had coworkers/classmates who smoked and was studying and also living with my mom who has been a chain smoker for almost 40 years now. 

That environment was very bad and triggered a lot of times. I'd be fine without smoking but before you knew it there was someone else smoking besides me. 

The title is a bit misleading, I do not suggest to move to a different country, but to mind your triggers. A change of scenery/doing things differently would already help a lot. 

From one day to another I had quit and I was fine, purely because of the drastic life change. No-one was smoking anymore around me which helped a great deal. I had been busy with trying to quit for years but that was the last bit that absolutely broke free my chains.

Very, VERY rarely I feel like having a cig, like watching a movie or after a meal but I can literally count those times on one hand in those 327 days I have quit. Feel just so much better, it's so worth it. Don't be afraid to crave it forever, even that will go away eventually.

3:26 where I'm at, and killing two birds with one stone

First bird: Posting on reddit. I wanna do more of it, so why not start here?

Second bird: Well, according to the subreddit I'm in, looks like it's not smoking anymore. While I may not just forever stop (Maybe smoke a rare cigar), I certainly would like to stop buying packs or consistently indulge in smoking. I'm going cold turkey, because if I've done it before I can do it again. I guess this time I want a neato counter, want to listen to stories, and also provide any incentive on what I have to bring to the table.

So, here's to my (we'll just call this the official one, I can't remember the right day of when I ran out) first day of not smoking anymore. Good luck to al those who wanna start, and keep it going to those who are at it now.

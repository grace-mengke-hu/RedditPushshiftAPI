Help with an idea: Stop smoking with a smart device that decreases nicotine vapor over time

Hi guys,

I'm an engineer, and having lost both my grandparents to smoking, I've always thought about ideas that help people quit smoking. Although I'm not a smoker, MANY of my friends smoke regularly.

I am considering building a prototype that would 

- Track the amount of nicotine you are ingesting

- Decrease nicotine dispersal over time based on your addiction

- Sync with your iPhone/Android device to give you a sense of where you are, and how you feel.

What would this be worth to you guys? I was considering doing a Kickstarter a while back. It probably wouldn't be that cheap to make, but I do have some ideas.

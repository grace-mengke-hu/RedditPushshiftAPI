5 days, 23 hours, 27 minutes

Quitting smoking this time has easily been one of the hardest things I've ever done in my 29 years. 

I've been an on/off smoker since 18 (never more than half pack/day) and have been able to quit for long stretches of time in the past but about 6-12 months ago, I got into a solid routine of smoking for stress, on the golf course, driving, etc. that became nearly impossible to break.

My wife is super into yoga and holistic approaches to wellness, so she encouraged me to give acupuncture a shot (no pun intended) and WOW - has it helped! The ear seeds I'm given at the end of each session really help along with the essential oil.

I broke down the day after my first acupuncture treatment (last Thursday), but since then I have gone almost 6 days without a single cig and have only been to two acupuncture sessions with my third later on today.

QUITTING CAN BE DONE!! AND WHEN YOU DO, IT FEELS GREAT!!

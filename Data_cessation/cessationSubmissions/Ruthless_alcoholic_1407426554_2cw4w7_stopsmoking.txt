Has anyone experienced extreme nausea and sweating after having a cigarette after months of quitting?

I quit smoking about two months ago. I woke up this morning and broke down and smoked 3 cigarettes. After the third cigarette in about two hours I turned really pale, started sweating profusely and felt so close to puking I have been hugging the toilet. Has anyone else experienced this? Also I seem to be having a panic attack.

Don't get me wrong, I am glad that I am having this extreme reaction - pack is in the trash and I am doubly committed but am just wondering if anyone else has experienced this radical reaction?

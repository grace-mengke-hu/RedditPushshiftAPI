Two years!

All thanks to Allen Carr's book [Easy Way to Stop Smoking](http://www.amazon.com/Allen-Carrs-Easy-Stop-Smoking/dp/0615482155). It didn't even take any willpower to avoid smoking, the book completely brainwashed me once I decided to take everything written in it as a fact and not an opinion.

I can ride my bike without getting exhausted immediately. I've started running a few times a week and actually **enjoying** it! There's nothing quite like putting on your favourite music and go for a run in the forest with fresh summer air streaming through your system instead of black tar and carcinogens.

Stay strong fellow quitters! Remember, it's all in your head.

If you have any questions, I'll gladly answer them.

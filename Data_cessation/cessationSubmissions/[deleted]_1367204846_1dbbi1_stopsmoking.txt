Went to a couple of parties over the weekend. Did not smoke. Fuck Yeah

So, my buddy got married over the weekend, and we had a couple of parties during the weekend. All of my friends smoke, and were smoking right in front of my during these 2 days, but I did not give in and did not smoke. I had a LOT of tempations to just smoke one "puff" but I did not and I am REALLY proud of myself. 

So guys if you are determined you have the power to not let situations like these side track you from your ultimate path.

Cheers!

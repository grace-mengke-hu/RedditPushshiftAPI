Tip. A nasty cold is a great way to quit smoking.

Had a nasty cold when I quit smoking. I've quit before and I know the first three days of physical withdrawal can be tricky, but the nasty cold really helped. Lungs all plugged up, coughing away, sweats and chills, worse than any nicotine withdrawal. Certainly did not feel like smoking. Three days later, healthy and happy, free trip to the next phase of quitting. Yeah.

Smoking cessation and weight shedding

Hello all. Just some ideas! I had been smoking heavily for ten years (I'm 29) and quit almost three months ago. What I wanted to share with all the brave quitters here is that weight loss is a major help when battling the addiction. 

I was also obese (man, I was fat and a heavy smoker, it was as if I didn't want to live past my 40ies), and after I quit I decided to lose weight as well.

Needless to say that the careful meal planning plus daily exercise keeps your mind away from smoking, not to mention that it helps your health immensely. If you feel a craving, you can eat carrots or drink water.

Almost three months clean and 20 lbs. less on my body! 

I only post this as a "thank you" to the subreddit that kept me strong during the first hell-weeks of smoking cessation. I owe you people a lot. 
Thank you, stay strong!!!

Spitting tar from my lungs after quitting smoking

Hello everyone, 

I am a long time lurker here and this is my first post on Reddit so I don't know exactly how to go on but I'll give it at try.

I have been smoking tobacco for about 10 years with a few breaks. The total time for the periods I did not smoke, if put together, would be around 1 year I would say. 

The last cigarette I had was at the end of September and until now everything is very good. Words cannot describe the difference between how I feel now in comparison with how I felt when I was smoking. 

For the last 4 years I was smoking my own hand-rolled cigarettes which for one reason seem a LOT stronger from every point of view than regular cigarettes you buy in pre-rolled packs. Besides this I was smoking a lot of rollies only with carton filter (if you know what I mean).

Since quitting I have been coughing up a lot of brownish/blackish stuff from my lungs on a daily basis which I can only interpret as a good sign because my lungs must be cleaning up, right? This is still ongoing after 76 days and I am amazed by the accumulated quantity of the stuff that I have expelled.

The brown stuff coughing usually happens in the following cases: in the morning after I wake up, after physical exercise or after I eat / drink something with warm / hot vapors like a hot meal or tea.

My question to you is the following: people who have experienced something similar, how long did it take you to stop coughing up stuff from your lungs?
Also, should I be worried? I have no lung pain, no discomfort, no problem breathing whatsoever as far as I can tell.

Thank you very much for all the info you guys have shared in this subre-ddit, it has helped me a lot!

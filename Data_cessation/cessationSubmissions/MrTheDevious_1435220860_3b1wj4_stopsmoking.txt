12 minutes in. It's on.

I've been a pack/day smoker for almost 10 years now.  I finally quit drinking 6 months ago and swore that cigarettes were next.  Sadly, my brain's pretty damn good at cranking out bullshit justifications and excuses, so here I am still smoking.

Stumbled across John Oliver's segment about tobacco earlier tonight.  I'd never seen the episode before, so I sat and watched the entire thing.  When it was over, I poured vinegar all over the cigs I had left, then threw my ashtrays/lighters  into a nearby river.

I will not be smoking again. Thanks for this fantastic support sub and huge congrats to all of you and your victory badges.  Seeing so many successes is A+ inspiration.  

Edit - Here's the video link for posterity, since I'm getting a bunch of messages about it

It's been 2 smokes

Last night I decided today I wouldn't smoke. Can't say for sure if this is me 'quitting' yet but I don't want to smoke today.  
I skipped my walking to work smoke, and my coffee break smoke.   
It may only be 2, but those are usually the 2 most important of the day, in terms of me not ripping everyone's head off... hoping the 'chill' continues.

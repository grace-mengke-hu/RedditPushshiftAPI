ACHIEVEMENT UNLOCKED: Spent four days partying in the Dominican Republic, didn't smoke a cigar

When I was a nonsmoker, I used to occasionally smoke cigars, and loved it. I figured now, a little more than a month into my quit, wasn't the time. People in my group were passing around a cigar and it smelled amazing, but I held strong and refused to feel sorry for myself. It may have helped that I was in the tropics with free rum in my hand.

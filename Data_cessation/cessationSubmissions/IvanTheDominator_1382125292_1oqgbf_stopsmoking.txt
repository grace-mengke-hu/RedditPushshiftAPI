50 days. %100 cold fucking turkey.

Well, that sucked. If anyone read my initial "I'm quitting" post i went through some pretty rough withdrawals. The first two weeks was a fucking nightmare. I felt like i had the flu, pneumonia, and bronchitis at the same time. I ate lots of cough drops for 2 reasons, they relieved the sore throat somewhat and the active ingredient is menthol and it took some of the edge off. Lots and lots of water, cranapple juice, and sleep. The sleep was hardest to come by because my feet kept twitching, felt like they were being ticketed with a feather. Constricted breathing, couldn't really catch my breath. Constant headache and sensitivity to light and sound. 
Hot and cold flashes, cold sweats and hot shivering. But all worth it!

After the first 2 weeks it started to get better but i was still coughing up a large amount of dark brown mystery substance. the twitching in my feet was still happening nightly. Smelling smoke would cause my joints to ache. The cravings were worse after the first two weeks for some reason. 

After a month was when things really got easier. Still coughing up random brown stuff. But my lungs started feeling better and i could take deep breaths. Realized my sense of smell had recovered (i never realized how much Cologne i was putting on as a smoker.) The smell finally out of my clothes. Awesome stuff.

And now at 50 days i feel AWESOME. I still randomly cough up that weird brown phlegm but other than that. 

Quitting sucked lots of dick but it was worth it. If  you are thinking of quitting, do it! And if you already quit, keep it up. Make every day your Bitch. Thank you boots for supporting me and thanks r/stopsmoking for simply existing!

Today is Day One

Quit last night after the Superbowl party. Today is my first day without any tobacco for 3 years now. My plans for the day include (leave work at 3pm, run to bank get rent money, clean out car (get rid of all cigarette butts and halfies), get gasoline, buy my favorite candy and fruit, workout, go home eat said candy with Kingdoms of Amalaur and then onto the next day.

I'll be posting what I'm feeling on here for both my sake and sometimes to ask for support.

February 3rd 2014... Here are some inspirational quotes.

"Every Journey Begins with a single step."

"Pain is weakness leaving the body."

"It isn't the mountains ahead to climb that wear you out; it's the pebble in your shoe." (Just read this today)

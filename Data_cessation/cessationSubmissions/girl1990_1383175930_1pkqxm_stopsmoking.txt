It's been a week now. Still not quite happy. :\

I'm not usually one to post on Reddit anywhere, but I figured I would post something here.
I've been smoking for 7 years and I've wanted to quit in the past few years. I quit for three weeks about three years ago but ran into an old friend that offered me a cigarette, and I stupidly took it.
I ordered Allen Carr's book after hearing people rave about it. Immediately after reading it (all in one night) I drowned my full pack and started anew.
It has now been a week since then and I don't feel any different. I feel like I should be happy that cigarettes are not controlling my life anymore, but in a way they still are. My cravings are only bad at nighttime when I'm by myself and bored. I cannot shake the thought of them though. I'm wondering if this is normal and if this will definitely get better in the near future?
I would appreciate some encouragement or a friend to talk to.

Two weeks down: a few thoughts about cigarettes, and why smoking is pretty lame.

So, day 15! Awesome!

Quick recap: day 1-4 were bad. Imagine the worst migrane , add a painful stomach virus and a handful of panic attacks and you're getting the picture. It was terrible and I enjoyed every minute of it. Facing the anxiety head on was a great challenge and I'm really proud. The last of week 1 was tolerable. Week 2 had been stressful but I'm feeling 80% normal already. 2 cravings or so per day. I don't get jealous at smokers anymore. I'm pretty alright except for a bit of the rehab blues - but I guess that will pass too.

The other day I recalled working at an advertising agency, editing a pall-mall ad for print. The ad featured a beautiful crescent moon on an Italian beach, a wooden deck and a couple soaking their feet in the water. 

Then it hit me: I was a slave. An addict. The tobacco industry took advantage of my weakness and tried to sell me success, happiness and freedom in a box of 20 smokes. Sleek design and catchy copywriting trying to convince you that you are a free spirit, careless and modern.

Oh, we were all wrong, weren't we? Our only "free" choice was to choose a brand and stick to it like a designer bag. I was not free, I was a miserable addict. 

The moment I realized this corruption I felt happy for the first time since I quit. I have nothing to miss or crave, because I gained what matters the most: control of my life.

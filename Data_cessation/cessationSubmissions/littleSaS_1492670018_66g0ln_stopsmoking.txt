28 days today - the world smells wonderful and sometimes gross

Today I can smell my deodorant, my feet and the dog next door.
I can smell the beer and tobacco cloud that envelops my housemate.
I can smell the lemons and limes that grow in my front yard.
I can smell coffee, grapes and passion-fruit.
I CAN SMELL!! 
Not everything smells great, but it's great to be able to smell again.

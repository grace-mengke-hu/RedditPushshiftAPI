I threw away the pack

It was my second pack. I'm mad now because my body feels so heavy, sluggish just typing this. The buzz and thrill and anxiety\-solver is gone. I don't think I'm cut out for this cowboy\-Marlboro\-red shit. I had one before bed and it tasted like shit. Weird. So I ashed it out and got another one and used a different lighter. It still tasted like shit. I yelled, "FUCK! FUCK FUCK!" and threw them all in the trash. It'll be a while before I even have an occasional cigarette. I just boiled some tea, I hope it helps. I am so, so angry. Thanks for reading

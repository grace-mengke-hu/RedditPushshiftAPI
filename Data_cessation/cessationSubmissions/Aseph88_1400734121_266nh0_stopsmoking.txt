Been lurking here for a while, thought Id post

In about 3 hours I will have gone 15 days without any nicotine whatsoever, the longest Ive gone without since I first started smoking 10 years ago. 

If you are still undecided about quitting, all I can say is.....DO IT! NOW! Best decision you will ever make.

And for everyone else, thanks for letting me live vicariously through your trials and tribulations and good luck going forward!

4 weeks! Some random thoughts.

Not a whole lot to say in this post, but when I was earlier in my quit I liked seeing people who posted slightly longer times than me, to know that they were successful and stuck around here. So here's my update to say that it's been four weeks since my last cigarette.

I think about them markedly less than in the first couple of weeks, but there are days when my brain still obsesses over the possibility of having one for hours at a time (I obviously haven't given in, but it's there). So far the part of me that wants to quit, and knows quitting is the best thing for myself has been stronger. Being confident and decisive in my choice to quit has been so important. And the attitude of "fuck you cigarettes, I win" has been fun to have too.

It's amazing how different smokers smell now too! It has this particular sour stench to it that I never noticed while I was smoking. Kind of like death?

Stay strong, fellow quitters.

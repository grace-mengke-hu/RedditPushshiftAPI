If you're too afraid to quit , you should enter this post.

 *I was a smoker for 7 years since I was 16 , Stupidest thing that I ever done.*

 *I was afraid as well to quit smoking , and tried so many times and failed after 3-4 days , maybe because I wasn't that mature back on those days.*

*But , After 41 days smoke free I can tell you the benefits so far , and there's only benefits.*

* You'll save your health.

* You'll feel pretty good in bed , your libido will be working even better :P

* You'll save money , and a lot of it.

* It will be easier for you to climb 3 floors of stairs without gasping for air.

* You'll smell good and not like a god damn ashtray.

* Food , even the simplest of it , will taste and smell like a little piece of heaven , I  guarantee that. 

* And you'll smile a lot , From Happiness.

***Stay strong Guys!***

This is it.

I've posted on here about quitting before. Twice to be exact. I got my badges the day I quit smoking; but, I ended up caving (btw, don't quit smoking and expect to go on a raging party bender a few days later and remain smoke free) and continued to smoke for a few months each time. 

So, my last cigarette was last Saturday. I decided this time to wait until it had been a week to try and stave of the embarrassment of not making it a week again. I am now a non-smoker. Obviously, I still get cravings (it's only been a week after all), but I've been reminding myself that I'm no longer a smoker and it really helps. I'm noticing changes in my health already. I got this. 

Thanks, Stopsmoking for helping me along and helping me stay accountable.

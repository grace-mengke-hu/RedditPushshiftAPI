In need of help

Ignore my badge, I've relapsed. Everyone, I'm really struggling. I really want to quit for myself, and I use the patch. But if I wear it while sleeping, I have night terrors, so I take it off. And then in the morning, I found myself unable to resist going out and getting a pack. Does anyone have some advice for my issues? With the patch on, I do well, but I also don't want these night terrors...

To all of you who continue to stay strong and beat this vile vice, I'm so happy for you, keep it up!

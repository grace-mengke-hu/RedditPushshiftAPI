Other vices have amplified in frequency & magnitude

18 year,  pack a day smoker and having attempted to quit several times,  only to buckle under the stress of cravings on a 3 day streak max.... This time however,  I have not experienced a single craving! but I have noticed that every one of my other addictions have amplified themselves 3 fold!!!!

Coming up on 21 days and I've noticed this since day 10. What the heck?! 

Anyone else experiencing this?

Tomorrow will be a true test for me.

Tomorrow will be day 10. Tomorrow I also have to go visit my in-laws. They smoke heavily. At least 2 packs a day for each of them.  The rule is that they cannot smoke inside when we are there because of our kid (I know, I know - it doesn't matter, it is still in the atmosphere, blah blah blah. I pick my battles people) but they still go outside at least once (usually twice) an hour to smoke. Plus it just smells like smoke in there. 
My only hope is that the smell disgusts me so much that I have no urge. I am going to take snacks and drinks with me to help with the urges and cravings. Not the best solution (weight wise) but it is something.  With any luck we'll only be there for a little bit. 

Edit: I need to explain also (in case anyone asks) no, I never smoked inside my house or around my toddler. My husband does not and has never smoked cigarettes so it was a strictly outside activity for me. Even when I lived alone I usually smoked outside because I didn't want to have to wash my walls/curtains/etc.. all of the time. Obviously the rationalization and mind of an addict is a hilarious place to be since I was subjecting my own body to all of those things several times a day, ha!

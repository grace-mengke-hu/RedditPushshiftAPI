TIFU

I was doing good, I had 4 on Saturday, 3 on Sunday, none Monday or Tuesday, but today I gave in. 

I'm disappointed with myself after all the hard work but I'm going to try again tomorrow

I work in a kitchen and everyone around me smokes so it's not hard to just ask for one. And even without asking, it's offered. I turned down so many before today. So why now?

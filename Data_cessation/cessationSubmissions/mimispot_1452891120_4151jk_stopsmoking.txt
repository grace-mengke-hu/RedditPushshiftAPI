What's your opinion? Should I expose myself to smoking environments or avoid it?

Hey folks!
Day seven is quite great. My headache and toothache is almost completely gone. My concentration is starting to get better. I can actualy feel that endorphine production is starting to be normal again. This probably also has to do with the fact that I quit drinking simultaneously and so I didn't really expose my body to depressants for a while now. It's kind of unsolicited happiness that's flodding through my body! What a surprise!
I wondered how to proceed from here. I think for the next week I still have a really good buffer since I can work by myself and don't have to meet other people. But then the semester starts again (I work in academia). A major source of stress is my work environment which is full of really obnoxious guys who think they know everything better than me. This stresses me out a lot and in the past I would get so stressed that I'd smoke. 
Another thing is that I will probably also start socializing more again which means I will also start being around people who smoke and drink. The question is: should I expose myself to these situations and try desensitizing myself so I won't get the urge anymore? Should I try to avoid these situations? Should I avoid them for a while and then ease myself back into the situations? I'm curious about things that worked for you folks! I am just trying to find the strategy that is going to be the most sustainable. Thanks!

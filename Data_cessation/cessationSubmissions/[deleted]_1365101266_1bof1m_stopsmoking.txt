anxiety

I have generalized anxiety disorder with agoraphobia.  I recently saw the doctor and my cholesterol is not so good.  I'm a long time smoker, 25 year old over weight male.  I need to quit smoking as i feel like shit every day, and i need my heart to get healthy.  Question is, I have a prescription for clonazepam.  Will this help me get through quitting?

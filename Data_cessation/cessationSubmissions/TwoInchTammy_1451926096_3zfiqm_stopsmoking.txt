That moment when your sense of smell starts to return...

My boss's office is next door, and I have noticed in the past that she has an oil burner always going. I never smelled it unless I was sitting right next to it in her office.

Today, the smell is approaching over powering while I sit at my desk next door.

Also, being that it is the first day back to work since quitting, I passed by an area that smelled really strong of stale cigarettes. It was right by where a group of 4-5 heavy smokers sit. It dawned on me that it probably always smells like that right there, but I never had picked up on it before.

Hello sense of smell! I forgot how much I didn't use you before...

Today is the start of day 4. Hanging in there. A bit distracted, but the cravings aren't very strong, and I feel like I will power through!

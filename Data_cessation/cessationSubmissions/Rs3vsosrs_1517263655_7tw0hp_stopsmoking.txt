3 months quit!

So this is a post about me being happy I've been quit for 3 months. 

But ever since I've quit, I've had sinus problems, my throat has been itchy and swollen a lot, I get migraines, and my anxiety/depression has skyrocketed.

Is this common? I always thought most symptoms were supposed to be gone by now?

Just to let you know

Long time reddit user but lost my account info and never created a new account. So today i created this account to let r/stopsmoking know I'm quitting, right now(and to upvote pictures of cats and game of thrones memes). Im 26 and smoke more or less 1 and 1/2 packs a day. Been smoking since im 15, started a pack a day around the time i turned 17. My friend just recently gave it up, made me start seriously thinking about it. Im going Cold turkey. F it. YOLO. I'll let you all know how its goes. Bye bye Newport's.

The countdown begins

I'm sitting here at the computer, smoking MY LAST CIGARETTE. Not going to lie, I'm completely terrified. I've had February 23 set as my quit date since early January. You see, it's my 28th birthday, which marks the tenth year that I've smoked. I'm sick of smelling like shit, my lung capacity being non-existent, chest feeling heavy, being so dependent on something so terrible for my health, spending so much money, the list goes on and on. I've made attempts in the past, but this time DOES feel different. More resolute. God help my husband, friends, family, and coworkers for the next few weeks. I'm not planning on being an asshole, but I know myself well enough to know it will happen. And I just put it out. Fuckfuckfuck. Wish me luck.

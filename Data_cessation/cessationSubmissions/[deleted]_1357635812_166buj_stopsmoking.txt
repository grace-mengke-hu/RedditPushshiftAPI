Finally going to do it. Hopefully this Champix can help. 

I've waited far to long to kick this filthy addiction. Started the Champix this morning and, maybe it's all in my mind, but the few cigarettes I had since lunch have tasted quite foul. Think it may be all in my mind, unless the medication can actually work that fast. Either way it's working, makes me want to stop going out for a smoke!

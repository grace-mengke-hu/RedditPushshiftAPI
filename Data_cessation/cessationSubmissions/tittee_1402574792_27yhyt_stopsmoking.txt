TWO WEEKS :)

I stopped 2 weeks ago today and I honestly couldn't be happier and prouder with myself. I honestly don't see myself cracking and having 'just one' and then a thousand more but i'll take it by year and see how we go. I have had a few really intense craves in the past few days but I showed them whose boss. Anyway, I am just updating with my progress. 2 WEEKS, fuck yeah

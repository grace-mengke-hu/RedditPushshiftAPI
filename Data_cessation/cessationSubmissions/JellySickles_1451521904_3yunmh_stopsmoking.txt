The urge to smoke when going out...

I'm visiting family right now for christmas, I've been here for about 2 weeks so far. They don't know that I'm a smoker so I don't smoke when I'm around them. They live in a remote area so there isn't much happening in their town and I've been indoors for almost the entire time. about 3 days in I actually forgot about smoking, no withdrawals,  no temptations, no nothing. fast forward  a week later and I still didn't have any temptations, it's like I have simply accepted that fact that I cannot smoke and decided to live with it. I left today and while standing waiting for the bus, all of the sudden I'm thinking about smoking, there was a shop right across the bus station and I was just nervously standing there resisting the urge while staring at the app in my phone that tells how long till the bus comes, which was about 14 mins,  it felt like it was 14 years. the bus finally came but I had to get off and get another bus to get to the train station, and that bus was due in 26 minutes, and there was a bloody shop right next to it. I don't know why it just seemed like waiting for the bus without having a fag for distraction just seemed like the most impossible thing to do, this is something that I have always done, I cannot remember ever sitting in a bus stop without having a ciggie in my hand. So anyways I managed to make it back to my flat without buying a packet, but tomorrow is going to be a horrible day since I have to go out and do some shopping and It's going to be another battle which I'm not sure if I can handle. the past two weeks have have basically convinced me that my addiction is not physical, it's all in my head and I have to just ride this one out for as long as I can.

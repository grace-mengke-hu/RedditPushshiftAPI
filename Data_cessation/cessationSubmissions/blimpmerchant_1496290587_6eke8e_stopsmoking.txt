I think it's time!

Close to a one year stretch nicotine free, everything fell apart.  My girlfriend and I lost our jobs (company closed), My girlfriend dumped me a month later (We worked it out two weeks after), I got fired for something that wasn't even my fault at my new job, and I put myself into debt trying to keep my head above water in this rough ass 2016/2017 with everything bad happening in my life.  My girlfriends two teenagers are being sneaky and not listening, my girlfriend is being all depressed about her kids, her own post-divorce finances and her new age this year (43).  Complete peaks and valleys of emotions with a complete lack of stability.  I'm OVER it.

I just turned 29, decided to return to school for accounting this fall (Halfway to a bachelors already), and my credit score is up 100 points in the past three months.  I've gotten much better at guitar over the past couple weeks after having my self-worth fall through the crack of the floor this past year and barely playing.  The kids have a week left of school, then they are off to their dads house for a week.  My long awaited break of taking them to school and picking them up daily is here.  

I've grown so much through all of this malarkey.  If I want my life to change, Its gotta start with me.  I gotta get out of debt faster, and a pack a day (or every other) is killing me literally and figuratively.  I want a better life.

I WANT a better life.

I WANT A BETTER LIFE!

It's a place to start.

Mornings are amazing since I quit!

I only quit 6 days ago ( 1 week tommorrow, yay! ) and just wanted to boast about how much mornings have changed! 
When I used to smoke, I would find it really hard to get out of bed, and when I eventually did, I'd be very groggy and tired for at least an hour... well, for the last few days waking up has been so much easier, I am fully awake within 10 minutes and my energy levels are so high! 
Soo, for those of you that are still about to take the plunge, go for it, you start to feel better right from the start!

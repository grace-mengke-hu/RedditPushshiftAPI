20 hours and 6 minutes smoke free

I'm craving so bad I'm drooling. I want to save the money but I freaking love going out for a smoke in the winter. And we are going to a cabin soon which I love just curling up with a smoke and book. Gahhhh my resolve is crumbling. These are all the situations I'm thinking of where I know I'll still want a smoke even months down the line. Gahhhh I want one sooo bad. Just have to vent somewhere.  Sorry


** edit** I know I didn't reply individually, but I just kept rereading everyone's comments and have stuck it out. I'm  27 hours in. Thanks so much guys!!!

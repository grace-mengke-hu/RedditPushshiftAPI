I grabbed a pack of cigars last night...

And after staring at it for about 2 minutes I put it back. We are on vacation in Hawaii and I really wanted a cigar on the beach but I couldn't do it. I was sad at first but I'm so glad I didn't buy them. Hawaii is great but I am enjoying my permanent vacation from smoking even more! Stay strong everyone :)

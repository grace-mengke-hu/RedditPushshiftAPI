4 weeks to quit

Is there any way I can quit in 4 weeks? My boss told me if I don't quit smoking in 4weeks, he's moving me on. Now, I know it's technically illegal (possibly not in my workplace, kinda hard to explain) but it's a good incentive, and it's good to know he cares about me, and wants me to have a healthier future. So how can I quit in 4 weeks? Any tips?

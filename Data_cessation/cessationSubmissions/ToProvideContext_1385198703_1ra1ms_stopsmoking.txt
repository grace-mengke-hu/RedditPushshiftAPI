Cold Turkey

I've quit before. Went 9 months without a smoke but I went back to it. I had all this anxiety that just built up and then these stomach problems that were driving me nuts. I went back to it, I didn't know what else to do. I do this for about 2 or 3 months, the smoking thing, and then A couple weeks ago I quit again. Since then I'm having all this reflux but not near as much of the stress. I also noticed that i've been kinda mean to my SO lately. 
I need some help people. I need some suggestions, some way to cope or something. I feel that since I quit smoking I've had all these health issues come up. I need some motivation :[ I need help finding my resolve and I want to feel good again. 

Any ideas?

TL:DR My life doesn't seem better when I quit and I need help.

OK let's do this!

So here we go. Been smoking on average 10 a day since I was 16, I am now 24 and just finished university. A few health issues and deaths to close friends and family meant I promised myself to quit once university is over. I'm just starting a new job next Monday and moving to a new city, so how I see it is it's now or never! My last cigarette was on Sunday at midday so I have just past the 3 day mark. 

My family know but pretend not too, so I cannot get support from them. Most of my friends smoke, and I do not want to force this change on them.
Today has been really tough, and was hoping for a few anomalous and honest support to help me out a bit.

Thanks in advance

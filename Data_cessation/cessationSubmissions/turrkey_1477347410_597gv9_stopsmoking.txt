I have been cigarette sober over a month..third times a charm!

I quit smoking for the 3rd time in my life on September 18, 2016. I am a 27 year old female, been smoking half pack a day for about 10 years. I quit when I was pregnant for 1 year in 2011 and quit again for 3 moths last October.  3rd times a charm! I feel like my skin, smell, sleep and lungs have been refreshed! The last 8 months before I quit again I was feeling terrible with each cigarette...and I knew thinking that was making it even worse. I feel better knowing I don't NEED cigarettes..they're not my buddies...they're not my friends..

Good luck to all those quitters out there!

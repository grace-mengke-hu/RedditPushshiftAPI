How can we take down this scam website?

I am in the US and just tried to go to Allen Carr's website.  "allencarr.com" took me to a Russian website selling pills/tablets under Allen Carr Institute name.  "www.allencarr.com" took me to the real website.  It makes me mad that someone is trying to make money selling placebo pills under someone else's name!

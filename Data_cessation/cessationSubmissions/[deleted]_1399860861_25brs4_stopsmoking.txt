Why would I quit when I really enjoy smoking?

I just cannot wrap my head around quitting. 

I enjoy stepping out at 3am and having one.

I enjoy stepping out with my colleagues and chatting whilst having one.

I enjoy having one on my walks.

I know I won't stop for money reasons or health wise. 

I just cannot wrap my head around this.

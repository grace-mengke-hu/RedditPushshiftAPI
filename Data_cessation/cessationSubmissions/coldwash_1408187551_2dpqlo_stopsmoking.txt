Living in the land of smoke - time to give up the cigs

Hi you lot.  Firstly I just want to say that this sub is really inspirational and I hope that this time, with the help of you guys, I can give up the smokes for good.  

Like many of you, I've tried quitting countless times and each time I somehow fall off the horse.  I know this is a pathetic excuse, but living in China makes quitting all the more challenging because smoking is so prevalent in Chinese (male) culture.

Anyway I'm three days in going cold turkey.  Today has been my toughest day, so I figured I'd stop lurking and make a post.  I know it's only the beginning but I need all the help I can get.  It is really shocking how many activities I had linked to smoking cigarettes...

Thank you.

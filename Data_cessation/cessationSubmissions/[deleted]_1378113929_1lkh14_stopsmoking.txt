Scared of Quitting.

So i decided to quit, i normally smoke anywhere between 5 and 30 a day (20-60 if drinking). My problem is that my cravings only hits when I am stressed out or bored, if everything is going fine or i have something to occupy myself, I don't smoke (well, don't smoke as much, if I have a relaxing day I might have one or two.) I have some nicotine patches that i haven't put on yet cause i don't want to put them on until i can say "I'm never smoking again." How do I stop myself from becoming too stressed and/or angry if I quit?

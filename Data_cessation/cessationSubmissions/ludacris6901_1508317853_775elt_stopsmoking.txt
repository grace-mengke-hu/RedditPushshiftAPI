I had my first smoking dream

The last several days have been filled with thoughts of smoking. Im pretty sure this has to do with the season change. Crisp fall air reminding me of smoking on the deck or something. Stupid i know. Ive had to beat a few cravings this last several days. But its easier to do these days. 

Last night i dreamed that i gave in and bought a pack. As expected i smoked several of them amd just like in real life they didn't bring me any joy or satisfaction but just tons of guilt. Then in my dream I had to go around to all my friends and family and explain to them why I was smoking again and that I was going to quit again soon. Ugh thats a terrible feeling and I've been there in real life multiple times. Then when I woke up the first thing I realized is that it was a dream and it was the best fucking feeling ever.

So just stick with it you guys, we can all do this. I'm sure today will be a great day and I will not smoke with you.

Recently quit, because I finally want to.

Started smoking at 15, am now 25. I finally got tired of being tired; not enjoying food/smells; feeling dirty; and making excuses. Always told myself I wouldn't smoke because the smell was terrible (mom and dad smoked). Once I started I always told myself I could quit whenever I wanted, but I think we all know that is not true; or it is (because we're doing it now), but it's harder than we could have imagined. 

I've realized I'm not reducing stress by smoking, I'm creating it. People always say how great a cigarette is after you've eaten, and I was one of those people. Let me ask you now, how great is the meal you've eaten, now that you can actually taste it again? 

This has seriously been a rough couple of days. I've managed to scroll through pages of /r/stopsmoking and downloaded a video of Alan Carrs, Easyway. Honestly what has helped the most has been coming here and reading the success stories of others. You fellow redditors are the most supportive group of people I think I've ever met. 

Anyone checked out http://badgebot.me/stopsmoking/ recently? If those stats are all true, that's fantastic. I'm new to reddit, registered less than 30 minutes ago, but have been a long time reader. 

Oh yeah, I'm doing this cold turkey. No e-cigs for me. I know the true test will come this weekend when the all the guys come over for poker/drinks. I think if I can make it one week, I can make it forever. I wish these cravings would stop though. Sometimes it's pretty intense. 

But we can do this...

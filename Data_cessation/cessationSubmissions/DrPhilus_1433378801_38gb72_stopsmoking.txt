Well.....

Well so far I'm 4 days clean, and I gotta tell you guys, I kinda miss it.... I don't miss the short breathes or smoking and it feeling like a chore, but I do miss it giving me something to do for the time being. I stand around people that smoke all the time and it doesn't bother me or make me want a smoke, so its not that. Idk guys, I guess I'm just looking for a reason to say fuck it and go on and smoke.....
Anyway I guess this was a little rant more than anything and I just miss chillin out and having a smoke with the bros..

24 hours!

In 12 years of smoking, I think the only time I've gone this long without a cigarette was in the first few months. But this wasn't hard, and neither will the rest be. Because I love being a non-smoker. Getting in my car after work, I almost took off my "work" sweater. But I didn't have to keep it not smelling like smoke. I can just wear my fucking clothes like a sane person.

When the 24 hour mark came within 5 minutes, the addict wanted to kill the time while we waited with a smoke. I had to laugh at that. Such a trickster!

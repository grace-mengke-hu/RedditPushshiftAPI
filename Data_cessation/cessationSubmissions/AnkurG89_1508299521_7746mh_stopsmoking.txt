16th day and want to thank this community

Hi Folks!

I know it's not a traditional milestone but this is now the farthest I have ever come in a quit attempt. And every other time I've either been using patches or nicotine gum. This is the best I've felt and I'm so glad I decided to quit cold turkey.

And it's only been possible coz of you guys. Everyone I discuss this with in real life is either a smoker that convinces me it's futile or an "ex-smoker" who talks about quitting like the easiest thing they ever did.

Only here do I see people encouraging &amp; supporting each other and generally being there with a kind word when needed. Also cautioning each other with how slippery a slope it is.

So thanks for your support and a special thanks to the veterans who still hang around just to help us out!

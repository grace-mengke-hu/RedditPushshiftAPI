Excuses: the dark side of creativity and relapses. What are your BS excuses?

My mind is a freaking genius at creating excuses for why I "just need to smoke tonight".  Yesterday, I was working outside installing a new hive of bees and I planned to have a beer (trigger) while I watched them get settled in their new home.  The beer trigger (a big one for me when I am having a beer away from home) plus the warm weather equals an excuse to buy a pack of cigarettes. It had been at least 20 days with nothing and then I relapse. 

Next day, the craving is stronger cause I fed it and I smoke again.  Watered and crushed the pack last night (like I always do when I relapse), but darn it, I hate the stories my mind creates to justify stupidity.  

What stupid excuses does your brain create?  How do you deal with the really attractive stories/excuses in order to avoid a relapse?

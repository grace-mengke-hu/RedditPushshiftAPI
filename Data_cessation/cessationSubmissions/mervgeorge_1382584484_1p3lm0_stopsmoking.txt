I have decided today i will quit smoking. Reddit, I need help.

I have decided after chain smoking everything there is for 6 years, to stop all kinds of smoking and going cold turkey. But I feel, the psychological aspects of not smoking will get to me and I would fail in this process.

I am posting this so that I have a start date and can keep updating my status with positive help from redditors.

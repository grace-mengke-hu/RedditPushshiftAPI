Struggling with my usual “reward” for work being done

I’ve wrapped up at work and am about to head home. I’m really struggling - it sounds so nice to go buy some beer and sit outside and smoke and drink the night away on the eve of a four day weekend.

I won’t, but any other idea for how to spend my time just feels empty, like it’s not good enough and won’t actually signal to my brain that I am officially off duty and can relax for several days in a row.

I know I’ll feel better tomorrow when I wake up, hangover and tobacco free, than I would with my usual “reward.” I know I won’t actually go buy beer and cigarettes. I know the real reward is that I’m making healthy decisions today. But the idea that I could ever find a tangible replacement reward seems so elusive right now...

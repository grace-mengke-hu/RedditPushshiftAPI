Bleh, this shit is hard.

I quit for 3 months with the help of this subreddit. Unfortunately, I failed and picked them up again. That was about a year or so ago. To this day I can't understand why I threw that away.

Fast forward to today, we've got three people in one house quitting, and everybody is crazy. It seems like every time I quit, I always have a sort of "meltdown" usually in the second or third day, and then it's relative smooth sailing.

I had the meltdown. I was shouting about giving up. I didn't, so here we are.

I have learned from previous mistakes, and because I *never* want to do this again, or be so aggressive to the point to where I hurt people around me, I'm going to make sure I stay quit this time.

Thanks for listening.

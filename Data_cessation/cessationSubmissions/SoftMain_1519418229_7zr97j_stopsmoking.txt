Hopefully my last try

I'm 28 and I have been smoking since I was 15... I have already made a few tries, and the last one I was able to stay off the cigarettes for almost a year! Then I started to just smoke one here and another one there, all of them in nights out with drinks or coffee with other people who smoked. I realised that my only problem is when I'm with people who smoke otherwise, I don't even have the need to smoke or cravings that are hard to deal with... So because of this issue, I bought an electronic cigarette that doesn't even have nicotine. But I feel kind of stupid smoking it.

Day 19 - relapse. Good god I feel guilty.

This were going rather well until this morning (March 21). I was using NRT in the form of nicotine spray about 4-5 times per day, when I got bad cravings.

But this morning I woke up about 4 am - couldn't sleep. I went out and bought a small pack of smokes.

Maybe it's just my catholic upbringing but damn do I ever feel guilty! On the other hand, after smoking 2 in a row, I didn't feel much of a rush. I guess that's a good thing? I don't know.

This was my first serious attempt at quitting - after more than 20 years of smoking. Now I have to get on the wagon again. Nonetheless I have a new strategy for the future: no NRT. Cold turkey all the way. I should have listened to the other people in this subreddit and gone that way to begin with; the NRT was/is just prolonging the agony of constant craving. 

Wish me luck. I could use it. I could maybe use a kick in the ass too!

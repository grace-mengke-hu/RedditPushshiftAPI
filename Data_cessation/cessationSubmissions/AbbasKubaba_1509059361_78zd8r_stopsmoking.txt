How to get over the 24 hour hump?

Hi all,

For the life of me, I cannot seem to get more than 24 hours before I smoke. I cut down from ~10 smokes a day to between 2 and 3 in the past one month (every time I crave one I break it into two and smoke only a half so that's about four to six smoke breaks a day). Any advice on how to push that number down from six to zero?

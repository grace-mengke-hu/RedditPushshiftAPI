Uh oh...

I smoked a pack and a half a day for 8 years. I quit 5 months ago. I had some unexpected family issues today and I broke. I bought a pack and smoked half of it before I realized the terrible mistake I had made. Has anyone been in a similar situation? Can you let me know what I'm in for? Please tell me I'm not back at square one...

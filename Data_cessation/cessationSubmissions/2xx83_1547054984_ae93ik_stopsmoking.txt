Trying to get my finances in better shape. I ran the numbers. It's really, really simple. I cannot afford this shit.

Things are going to be tight this year due to a $200/mo increase in my health insurance premium (thanks, obama). So I'm trying to eliminate all financial surprises by listing every expense that can be predicted. In 2019, the sum of all my bills and predictable expenses (vacation, birthdays, Christmas, regular car maintenance, new work boots in the spring, some new clothes in summer, etc etc etc etc) comes to about 60% of my net income for the year. After paying out this percentage each week along with another percentage for savings, I'll be left with, on average, a $110/week "allowance" for day to day expenses like groceries, gas, household items, etc.

This is obviously low even without smoking and I'm seeing what I can cut out of my predicted expenses to be more comfortable and maybe be able to have some fun here and there. But with smoking, the allowance will be 75 measly-ass dollars a week. Simply undoable without having to borrow from my partner all the time. 

And that's only looking at the money reason. Obviously there are many many other reasons but I cannot argue with the numbers or rationalize them away or wait until later. This is the financial version of a lung cancer diagnosis as a reason to finally quit. Get your shit together or else. 

The habit simply has to go or else I'll have to make sacrifices to the things I want to do or worse, the things I have to do. I'm saving for our wedding. We're going on a great vacation this year. Nice things. I don't want to lose them. 

I'm so tired of going through this cycle... I told myself that 2018 would be the year I quit. And before that 2017, and 2016, and 2015. I've had umpteen jillion quit attempts. Cold turkey. Patch. Gum. Vape. 2 days here, 6 weeks there.

Tired of it. I have three cigarettes left. I'm not buying more. It's not in the budget!

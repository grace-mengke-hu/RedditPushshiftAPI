Long time smoker bit worried

I've been using vape for 30 days after 38 years smoking. Would still be smoking if the option was cold turkey so a good compromise for me. I don't want to pick up another cigarette, ever. I'm so pleased as are family and friends!

I was amazed at how quick breathing came back but I thought I should have cleared up loads of gunk by now. But no. No cough or phlegm clearing. Until today when I've had a few chest pains and bits are coming up very gradually. I hope I can clear long buried crap in my lungs. 

Am a bit paranoid so am going for X-ray this week even though doctor thinks it will show clear. Am a bit shit-scared but, hey, am young enough to survive if the worst shows up. I hope! 

Thanks for all the support on here. It's been so helpful reading all the struggles and achievements of all sorts and ages.

Keep up the good fight!

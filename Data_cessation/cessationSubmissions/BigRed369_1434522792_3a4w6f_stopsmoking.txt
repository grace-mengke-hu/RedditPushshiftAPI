THAT smoker smell

Woke up this morning (day 12) and really felt like I wanted to buy cigarettes. I've had a really stressful few days at work and home but telling myself that smoking isnt the solution. THEN I got on my morning bus and sat behind a gent who smelt horribly of stale smoke and it just made me feel ill! 

Cravings really do just pop up but been trying to distract myself at the times I would normally smoke. Going to make a cup of tea in the office instead of going outside, having a chat with a colleague, playing a game on my phone etc. Hopefully I can keep this up!

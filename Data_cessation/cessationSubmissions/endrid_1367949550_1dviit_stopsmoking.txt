Really happy that I quit

Hey guys!  I posted here a few days ago saying I quit because I was sick and figured I'd just go with it..  Couldn't be happier.  I can taste food much better now, I can breathe deep, and I don't have that nagging guilty worry about cancer in the back of my head.  I'm gonna go get a little exercise.  Just wanted to say thanks for this subreddit.

*Sigh* Day one.

Day one. Again. After 40+ days. First and foremost I want to apologise to everyone I've given advice to on this subreddit. I feel embarrassed. I feel like a hypocrite.

My ex-fiancée reconnected with me last night. I smoked a pack in about 7 hours. It wasn't something I was prepared for, but on the other hand, it was too easy an excuse not to smoke. Even after four years, it still affects me. It wasn't on my list of triggers, but it is now.

I think back to the past few weeks. I felt great. Not only because I wasn't smoking, but because I was doing so much more than not smoking. I was exercising. I was active both physically and mentally. I was engaging with life. 

Thankfully, I've seen the benefits of not smoking. I want to be back there again, or rather, I don't want to lose what I've been working towards.

I don't think it gets said enough, but thank you to the community, for keeping me accountable – I may not know you personally, but you have helped me immeasurably and continue to do so. So thank you, thank you, thank you.

Enough about feeling sorry myself.

Stay strong brothers and sisters.

I really need to stop.

Today will be my first day properly and I can't wait. I quit for about a month a while ago inbetween sinus surgery but stupidly picked it up again. My health isn't very good, constant sinus infections again and just feeling horrible in general. I think I'm depressed as well. 

It starts with small steps in the right direction and I really want to stop wasting my life on things that are making it shorter. Smoking, stress, harmful thoughts. I'm ready to become the person I wish I could be. Good luck to anyone else on this journey, the damage we're doing to ourselves is not worth a few minutes of inhaling smoke. Fuck cigarettes!!

2 years!

Many thanks to this sub, I have been fully quit of nicotine for 2 years as of today.

Thank you all so much for your help, I couldn't have done it without you :)

For those of you people just quitting or thinking about quitting, take it from me: it's not as hard as you think and it's one of the best decisions you'll ever make.

Lethargy and exhaustion from nicotine?

When I talk to fellow smokers, I often mention how smoking knocks me out. It literally will take any plans or motivation I had for the day and throw it out the window. Sometimes I can take three hour naps after a few cigarettes. This happened even when I quit smoking cigarettes and switched to vaping for a year. Others would tell me how it wakes them or perks them up. 

Is this something that differs from people or is this a unique reaction for me?

I also find my disgust and hatred of cigarettes is at its strongest at the end of the night when ive had my fill and suffer from body aches or headaches as a result. Then when I wake up the determination is gone. Its almost like I wake up with energy and my immediate reaction is to snuff it out, smoke and get back to the foggy lethargic state.

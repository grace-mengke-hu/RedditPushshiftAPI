Quitting the oxygen withdrawal today and look forward to breathing for real after 24 years of suffocating myself

Long time lurker here and made this account a few days ago to post and track my quit. A pack a day smoker for the last 6 years and half a pack for 18 years before that. Tried quitting a few times, longest being for 8 days. I am done with this filthy habit now. Half way through the Allan Carr video now and once this is complete, I start the rest of my life as a non smoker.

I am going in with the mindset that every cigarette I smoke causes oxygen withdrawal and nicotine withdrawal is something to look forward to.

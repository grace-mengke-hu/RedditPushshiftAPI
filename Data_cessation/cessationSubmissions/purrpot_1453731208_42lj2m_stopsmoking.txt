Today is the day!

First, I wanted to thank everyone here! I've been following this sub for a while now and you all have given me the inspiration to try again. 

So a few minutes ago, I just smoked my last smoke and I've vowed to never buy any more again. 

Here's my thing: I've tried to quit a bunch of times before, but what always does me in is feeling tired and unable to focus. The longest I've ever made it was 6 months and I finally gave in because all I wanted to do was sleep. What strategies do you guys use to get past the brain fog? 

I'm going to exercise a bit more regularly to help keep my energy up, and I've seen it mentioned that quitting smoking messes with your blood sugar, so I'll keep some fruit juice around. And, I've got a vaporizer, but in past quit attempts, even with strong juice, it helps a little but I still feel dazed. Is there anything I'm missing?

Thanks in advance everyone! Looking forward to contributing where I can!

One year

Well it's been one year since I made one of the smartest decisions I have ever made. I've saved money, got healthy picked up a new hobby (mountain biking!) that smoking reduced my ability to do.

My advice to all you people on day 2, or 5, or 40 is that it gets easier. Sure the thought still crosses my mind, but I think of it grossly, and even an occasional urge to smoke is easily overcome. Stick with it, it's absolutely worth it!

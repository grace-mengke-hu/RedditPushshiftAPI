Smoking induced sinus problems

Anyone out there have terrible sinus problems from smoking? It'd been almost 22 days since I quit and although I feel a lot better then I did 22 days ago, I still feel blocked up and congested (mostly at night and in the morning) It's a huge reason why I quit and i just want to feel normal again.

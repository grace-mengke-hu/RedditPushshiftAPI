Day 2

So today is day two of me being a former smoker, and it's going pretty good. I've smoked a pack a day for 18 years. 

About four years ago I read Allen Carr's book and quit for the first time cold turkey for 5 days. I've spent a lot of time since then thinking about quitting again, why it failed the first time, what my motivations are etc, and a couple of weeks ago I signed up to a free quit-smoking-program offered by the city municipality. It's a 5 week program, where the participants meet once a week in a group meeting, where you get to discuss your thoughts and fears about quitting the cigarettes. There is a cessation therapist, and you get free NRT if you want to use it. We all decided on a joint quit day, which was on Sunday, and tonight we're meeting for the first time since then.

I've been using the patch for the last week, and I'm pleasantly surprised at how effective it has been so far. I remember the last time I quit, and how I was thinking about cigarettes non-stop in the start; this time not so much. I'm still pretty concerned about the step down process with the patch, but hopefully I'll be able to take things one day/hour at a time.

Anyways, just wanted to say hi, and thank you for your inspiring stories.

Bonus fact: Since I was 16 years old, I've smoked about 130,000 cigarettes, costing me somewhere around $50,000.

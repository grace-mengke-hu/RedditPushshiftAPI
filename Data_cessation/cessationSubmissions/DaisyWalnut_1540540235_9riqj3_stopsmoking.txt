Rewards - how do you space them?

Just got passed the 4 week mark and am feeling so proud of myself! My tracker tells me I’ve saved 66 pounds which is great, I’ve been storing it separately from my main account and topping it up as motivation. 

Was just thinking about what to do, so I’m studying and don’t have much cash at the moment so I was thinking it would be really nice to spend the money each month on something nice for me that I would otherwise find hard to afford eg a new haircut, shoes, nice toiletries etc. 

But...if I didn’t spend it for a year which I obviously could afford as I was spending it all before I could go on really great holiday! Which would obviously be mega. Feel like there’s pros and cons to each so was just wondering what others have done with their new found spare change?

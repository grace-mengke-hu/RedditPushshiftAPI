I have smoked my last cigarette

New year's resolution failed since I was partying. Then I was able to quit from the second of January untill I relapsed at the end of February. I had something to celebrate and bought a pack to just smoke one... well surprise that didn't work out. Just last week I was finishing my pack and thought this is my last one. Nope... smoked two packs since.

The triggers for me are: 
-planning to meet friends, allthough almost none of them smoke (anymore) I just feel more comfortable when I smoke. 
-Something to celebrate when working all day on my thesis and making good progress.
-Driving on the highway, even after having quit a month or more I sometimes get this irresistable urge to stop at the gas station to smoke, the first always tastes bad, does not do much in my head except for the dizziness/nausea, but the second one I smoke immediately after already has me hooked and the cycle can repeat itself. 
-Payday, when I get paid from my student job, I feel the need to buy a pack since money is not an issue then... dumb I know... 
-Not being able to concentrate on difficult things I should know for uni...

Though I am determined now, I know these almost irresistable urges will come back and I want to be prepaired, any tips are welcome!

I smoked from a very young age (13), on and off and ofcourse once a month at 13 is (half) a pack a day now (26). And off is quitting for one or two months per year, once or twice a year.

Sorry for the rant. Just want some tips and to be held accountable and get some encouragement why it would work this time (after 200+ tries, not all of them serious, but still 20+ serious attempts). Just this Friday I said I was quitting to my friends and they just laughed it off. They were right tho because today I met some of them for brunch and ... I was smoking. They heard me saying I quit or will quit already more than 200 times, not exagerated. 

I dream of becoming old and increasing my running capabilities.

To close this litany I just want to share a thought I had when scrolling through an unrelated subreddit which was talking about why insects have no lungs. This person said something along the lines of "lungs evolve from gills, only after millions of years of evolution..." and here I am, destroying these two probably not so pink anymore wonders of nature with the rest of my body....

Peace!

social smoker?

I "quit" smoking 4 months ago but when my sister comes over I end up smoking with her. Its literally the first thing I want to do when she comes over, like hey lets go out and have a cigarette. I dont buy cigarettes or smoke by myself at home but if I see someone smoking I'll bum a cigarette and smoke with them. Does anyone else have this "social smoking" issue?

Look at how pathetic we are

We come here, talk about how we hate cigarettes or how we want to quit in order to get healthier,  and then we mope and get stressed out because we want another cigarette. 

Seriously this behaviour is completely irrational! The only way to explain it is that we are all addicted to a drug. 

I feel like if I identify myself as a drug addict, then the feeling of "god i want a cigarette" goes away. It becomes a battle between me and the cigarettes. Seeing it as a sacrifice in order to improve your health or money situation makes it 1000 times harder. At least for me.

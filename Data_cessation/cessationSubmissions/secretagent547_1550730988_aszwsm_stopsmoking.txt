Starting a smoke free life tomorrow!

I have smoked all through highschool and only quit when I was pregnant with my two kids. I started smoking a year after my son was born because of stress of my husband being deployed. 

I have attempted to quit four times during his deployment but couldnâ€™t make it stick. Tomorrow I am trying again! I just hate how I feel and how I smell! 

Wish me luck!!

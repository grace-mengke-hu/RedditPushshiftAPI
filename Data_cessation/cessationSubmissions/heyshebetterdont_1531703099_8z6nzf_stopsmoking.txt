Ugh it’s me again..,

Hi everyone, I hope you aren’t tired of hearing from me. Y’all have been more than helpful! My husband has been quitting smoking and it’s been 14 days today (yay!) it is very “yay” except I feel like he is so mean to me now. Will it get better? I’ve been patient so far but he’s pretty much made me cry at least once a day since he quit, and I don’t know what to do. Of course I’m not giving up on this, but he’s just not the same person I fell in love with. I guess I’m just fishing for some encouragement, if you have any. Thanks a million for all the help you’ve given me already ❤️

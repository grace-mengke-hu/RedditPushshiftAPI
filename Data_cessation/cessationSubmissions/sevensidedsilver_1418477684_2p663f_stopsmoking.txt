The Secret To Quitting for Good

I just finished "The Easy Way to Quit Smoking". 
Most of the book is dedicated to breaking down all the "pleasures" you think you get from smoking, and the actual kicker is a simple two steps:

1. Make the decision to stop smoking
2. Celebrate the decision instead of moping about it

When I read that I stopped using willpower to not smoke and finally felt free from addiction. Be happy you're quitting! It's the best thing you can do for yourself unless you've jumped from a plane and haven't pulled the parachute. In that case, just wait till you're on the ground to quit.

Every time you want a cigarette don't sit there and think about how "good" it would be. You know they're terrible and you don't enjoy them. Instead think about how awesome it is that you're a non-smoker and don't have to pay to torture yourself anymore!

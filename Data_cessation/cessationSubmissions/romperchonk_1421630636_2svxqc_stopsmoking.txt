Quitting tonight

I'm 22 years old, been smoking since I was 15. A Pack a day since 18. Really feeling it now and know it's time to quit. Have tried to quit so many times, usually just lasting a few hours. Longest I went was 5 days after I got my wisdom teeth pulled. Everytime I try to quit, I see someone smoking or dipping at work and bum one. Go right back into the cycle. I love hiking, and steep inclines destroy me now. I used to shoot up hillsides like a dog. My dad always smoked when I was a kid and it was my favorite smell in the world. That's what got me started. I'll see how work goes tomorrow.

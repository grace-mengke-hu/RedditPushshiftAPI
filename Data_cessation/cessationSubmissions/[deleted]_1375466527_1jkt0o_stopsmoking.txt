About 140 days in.

I have about 140 days of being smoke free.  I have noticed recently my cravings might be getting worse. They aren't as frequent but they are worse. I have also noticed that I get angry at people smoking around me, not because they are smoking but that I can't. I smoke a lot in my dreams too is this normal?  Waking up and realizing I didn't cheat is kind of cool though. Anybody experience anything similar?

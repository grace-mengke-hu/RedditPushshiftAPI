35 years a smoker and five days clean

Hi all- I read *â€™Allen Carrâ€™s Easyway To Stop Smokingâ€™* and did just that. Amazing book, canâ€™t recommend it enough. 
But. 

5 days in and got my first real cravings today after 4 days of feeling high af from the elation that Iâ€™ve finally escaped- normally Iâ€™m a pretty mellow geezer- theyâ€™re not enough to make me consider smoking again but they *are* annoying the fuck out of me and producing some pretty violent moods. Iâ€™m not gonna go out and attack anyone but Iâ€™m wound up to fuck and probably ready to start headbutting/punching walls. Not that Iâ€™ll do that either, I just feel like it. I can handle wanting a fag but the effort of suppressing this temper is getting to me- how long does this phase tend to last on average? 

Edit, am chef as well, which isnâ€™t helpful. Hoping I donâ€™t despatch a kitchen porter to the Promised Land today ðŸ˜‘

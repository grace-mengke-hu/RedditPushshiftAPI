Weight gain

I've been nicotine free for five weeks and have put on 7lbs.   This gain isn't due to some evil sorcery, it's due purely to me being greedy. 

I've been consciously replacing cigarettes with chocolate and all the good feelings from not smoking have been covered up by the shame and low confidence of the weight gain. 

Today I signed up to Weight Watchers again and I'm determined to look and feel good once more. If I can beat the smoking monster than I can do anything.

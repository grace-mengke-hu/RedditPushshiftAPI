Has anyone quit/is anyone in the process of quitting who takes uppers for ADD?

I just got my 2 star (yay!), and my husband is inspired by my success and cutting back as well. However, he takes Vyvanse, and when he is unmedicated he has no problem not smoking much-but when he is medicated, especially within the first few hours, he practically chain smokes. I know he wants to quit, but I also know that to actually do so would be incredibly difficult with his medication-which is something that he cannot quit if he hopes to function at all on a daily basis. 

I was hoping there might be some other quitters out there who have had experience with giving up nicotine while on amphetamines, that might have some helpful advice I can pass along.

I think I used to make myself little caves of acceptance with my smoke when I used to smoke.

Right? I'd have a haven of smoke in my apartment where sadly there was no one to worry about but me. Smoking was a whole ritual of acceptance for me. When I had the cloud of smoke around me, I could stand there and justify any little thing I done.

Fuck this shit man. it ain't cool. don't do nicotine.

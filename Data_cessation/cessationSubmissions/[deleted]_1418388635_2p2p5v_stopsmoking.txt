Becoming a smoker. Need helo now.

Hello, I'm 20 years old and at university. I've gradually started smoking when on nights out or with friends. I've noticed I've started buying cigarettes and smoking when I'm on my own which is worrying me a lot.

I maybe smoke a max of 5 a day which isn't too bad...at the moment.  But I know I will end up smoking more and more.

I wouldn't class myself as a smoker just yet and I want to keep it that way.

One problem is that I regularly smoke cannabis in joint form (mixed with tobacco to help it burn). 

Any advice on how to completely stop before it's too late?

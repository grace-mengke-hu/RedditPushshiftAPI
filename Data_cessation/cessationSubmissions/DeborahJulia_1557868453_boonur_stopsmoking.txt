Wine

Has anyone else aggressively started backing white wine? Like 3 glasses at night? Also feeling super depressed like it's been well enough into the quit (57 days) that that's probably not the reason so maybe it's the wine I dunno. Anyway has anyone else had this and does it go away or do you have to work at it because at the moment I spend most of my afternoon at work thinking about the glass of white wine I'm going to have in the evening. Also I'm still super craving cigarettes at night like more than the other people on this forum seem to be is that because of the wine or is the wine because of that? Also reading everyone elses posts has super helped so thank you guys!!

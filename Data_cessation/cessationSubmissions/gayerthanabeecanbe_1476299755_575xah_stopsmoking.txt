Craving to Smoke Again

Just a little background, 



I am currently 15, I quit about 7 months ago. I was 14 then. I was drinking alcohol and smoking quite a lot; I was going through a hard time. 


I have gone through 7 months without touching a cigarette, it was hard at first, but once things got busy in my life, it was good to not take all the extra time to smoke. 


Recently, every minute I have been getting that anxious craving to smoke a cigarette, like that moving your leg, hyper without smoking feeling. I don't know why it just started, but I have been struggling so hard with it, I have been wanting them so badly. I have been cranky without them, and I know it will be awful to start again and I don't want to, but I can't stop whatever this is. 


I really am happy with my progress, it has been 220 days, and whether it be 1 day or 220 days, it is the effort that I have put in to become a healthier and happier person that is why I am proud. I struggled with alcohol and smoking, and I managed to quit both because I have a good future, and I am just going through a crappy time. I just don't want to throw all that away by starting again, it's such a strong craving to smoke, I feel so jittery and anxious without it, and I haven't felt like this since I quit. 


Has this happened to anyone before? If so, if you have any advice it would be very helpful.


Thank you ahead of time.

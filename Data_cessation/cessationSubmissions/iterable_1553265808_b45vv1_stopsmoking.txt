Day 23 finally had good nights sleep.

Started out with a bad sinus infection. Week in got some meds. My rule has always been to stop smoking when sick and well after to allow recovery. Five years ago when I was 30 I stopped for 10 months just because I like to show I still have control. I do this for coffee and alcohol also. This time around don't think I will be going back to smoking or even vaping. Even after my my run of meds I now have a ringing in my leftish ear somewhere which Doc said can take a few weeks to heal and random sinus pressure behind eyes above my nose. The worst thing I have done is google how I feel and just makes things worse. Best thing I have done is green tea, ginger tea, and aspirin when head bothers me to much. Last night I had two solid chunks of sleep four hours each. I had been waking up a lot and this morning really just wanted to pass the frak back out lol. Hope this is a sign of getting better. What is just shocking is how five years ago this was so easy and now so hard. My father stopped around same age and best thing he told me was never say quit think stop or taking a break. It helps a lot when thinking about and I hold the condition that if we find out the earth is about to be destroyed I will break out my emergency pack. I know that may sound weird but it works for my mindset. Oh and thank this subreddit for being here  you are all awesome :)

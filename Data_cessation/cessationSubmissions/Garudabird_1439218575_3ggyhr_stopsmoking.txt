23kgs up 6 flights

I've just returned home after being away for about 6 weeks.  I started my quit while I was away and have been a bit concerned about all of the triggers I still need to face being back in my everyday life that I was still smoking in before I left. However, I carried my 23kg suitcase up the 6 flights of stairs to my apartment (there is no lift) and for the first time carrying anything heavy up the stairs, I didn't feel like I was going to pass out when I reached the top. I'm not saying it was easy but I could actually catch my breath, my heart didn't feel like it was about to explode out of my chest and I didn't feel like a heart attack waiting to happen. I don't think I'll be entering any sort of ironman competition just yet but it sure felt good!

Counting the days/weeks is giving me cravings!

I hate to count how many days or weeks I've been smoke free because it makes me think about smoking and I end up having more cravings!! After the first 3 days, I was doing super good, almost never thinking about smoking. But the closer I got to my first month, I kept thinking ''ohh I haven't smoked for almost a month'' and I don't know if it's because of that but I've been having more cravings lately. Nothing strong enough to actually make me buy cigarettes, but it's annoying to think about that so much. Even when it's in a good way, I'm still thinking about those nasty cigarettes! It's like getting rid of a bad friend and thinking about him every day, it doesn't make sense!! I want this thing out of my system and OUT OF MY MIND!!!! I WANT TO BE FREE!!!

Sorry, I know it's impossible, I just needed to vent.

Anyone feeling the same? Any thoughts?!

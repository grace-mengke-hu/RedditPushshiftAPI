How do I NOT relapse tomorrow?

Its day 2 today and I am fine the urges are there but I can handle them but what I am a little worried about is tomorrow. To people who don't know (Probably all of you) tomorrow is [EID](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eid_al-Fitr)

and since there is a lot of eating and greeting involved there is lot of urge to smoke and socialize with relatives and cousins most of them who smoke now. I haven't told anyone yet that I have quit yet except my sister and this random guy on street :P . 

What are your people suggestions. Do I avoid the interaction all together do I NOT go out for there small cigarette breaks or do I and I just don't smoke ? I can handle my brother smoking in front of me but 4-5 people might get intense. 

Do I tell them I have quit smoking or do I wait a week or so to actually make that claim concrete ?

Appreciate everyone's support. God Bless You All! and EID MUBARIK :)

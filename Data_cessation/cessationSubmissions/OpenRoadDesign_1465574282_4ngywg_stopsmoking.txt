So I thought having one would help how I feel. Turns out, I just hate my job.

I just bought a pack and smoked a cigarette. Nothing changed. Still bouncing off the walls. Still feel unsettled and anxious about my day. Smoking did nothing. I walked up to the first person I saw, asked them if they smoked and gave them the pack. 

I'm officially a non-smoker. The only difference now is I have to do some serious thinking about what I'm doing with my life, how I spend my days. My life style has to change. Smoking isn't going to fix that.

Time to make some more changes for the good and I'm happy to say smoking isn't going to be a part of my new life. To new beginnings, cheers.

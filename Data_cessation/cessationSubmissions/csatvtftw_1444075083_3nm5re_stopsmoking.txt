I had a puff at the bar the other night...

and it was the most disgusting thing. It was a friend's cigarette, and I'd been drinking, so I had a puff. Despite it being the same ones that I had smoked for years, it tasted so so bad, and made my throat scratchy. It made me definitely never want to have another one ever again. I'm so happy with my decision to quit, and so proud of myself for sticking with it this time, despite this one puff (which I don't regret, as it just solidified my desire to stay quit).

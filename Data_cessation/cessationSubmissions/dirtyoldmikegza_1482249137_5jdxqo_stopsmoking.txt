so im 13 hours in...wish me luck

i smoked for 30 years, this is the latest and i hope the last time i put the slow smoking death down. im on wellbutrin and the patch (21 mg) hoping to get over the hand-mouth habit before i step down on the patch...i dont drink (sober 10 years day-at-a-time) so that wont be an issue...any advice or encouragements ill thank you for...

5 days down!!!

It's been rough but I made it, even though I'm going the e-cig route, I'm feeling a lot better. I can breathe easier, I have more energy, and overall feeling great. I have the Smokefree app and watching how many cigarettes that I'm not smoking and how much money I'm saving just in a few days really puts it in perspective and I feel better everyday. 
Coming up on a week without smoking !!!!!

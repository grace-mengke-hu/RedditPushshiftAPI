going on my fourth day here and need some encouragement

fourth day in started after coming back home from Christmas Holidays. First day back at work and i'm just trying to figure out how to stop myself from craving during work hours, im a designer so i would usually use my smoke breaks as moments to reflect and concept, not really sure how to do that without my crutch

I tried it once over 2 weeks back, I'm feeling incredibly stressed out, to an extent where I've never felt so.

I don't know if it is the effect of the nicotine causing some sort of withdrawal, but whatever it is, its a dopamine craving to the extent of hunger. I don't like it. I feel primal. Can you guys inform me on whether or not its a withdrawal symptom, and if so, how long it would take for the urges to flatline? (this was the only time I tried it)

Thanks

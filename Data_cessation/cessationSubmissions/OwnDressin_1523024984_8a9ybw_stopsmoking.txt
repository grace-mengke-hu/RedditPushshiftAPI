Thought I would drop in on this joyous day.

I have other addictions that I have been focusing on and am happy that I caught this subreddit today. It's been 100 Days!

Some things I can reflect on:

* I absolutely can tell the difference in my lungs. No shortness of breath. I can run and jump and have boundless energy. Getting winded is rare.

* God, the smell. It is pungent on those that smoke. Deep and sharp. 

* Money. HA! I have a savings account now. And a rainy day fund tucked in my drawer. Next stop, a RothIRA.

* Time. It takes 5 minutes to take a smoke. Plus the time to get outside, come back in, and reset to get back to what you were doing. Add that to the 10 times a day (for me)... What the fuck....


We all know the advantages of quitting smoking. Or we wouldn't be here right now. They are all true and I can honestly say that I am never going back. It's a closed chapter in my life. There's other shit I'd like to focus on now.

Don't be discouraged by relapses. Keep fighting. It's not an easy battle by any means. But you will get there. Don't give up this early.

**You are stronger than you think** :)

No way back now !

After the odd 20 years of a pack a day, I have stopped all forms of nicotine for the last 9 (nine!) days, and thanks to the support of many people around this sub I'm feeling very strong. 

To make sure I stay quit, I have made a wager with my colleagues at work. I'll pay them 10 to 1 if I consume any tobacco with the next year. This could cost me a lot of money (we're talking multiple 1000s of dollars here), but I know I will be taking their money.

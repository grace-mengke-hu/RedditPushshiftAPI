My favorite things about quitting so far.

1. I'm not stinky anymore! There was only one other person in my office that smoked besides me. Now when I smell her I am disgusted that that used to be me. When I was smoking I knew that I smelled like smoke, but I had no idea it was that bad. No amount of spray or perfume can cover that shit up.
2. And this one is the best one. I can inhale deeply without feeling the tightness in my chest or having to cough. I smoked for 14 years and for the last few months I noticed that I could go hours without being able to take a really deep breathe. This fact was really making me panic and is ultimately why I wanted to quit. 

It's a tough road but I feel so proud of myself for starting this journey. This community is immensely helpful and the Cessation Nation app it's the shit.

I'm well on my way.

To ring in the New Year, I was invited to a friend's house for a few drinks as the ball dropped. The house was full of smokers and plenty of drunks. This was my third day into my journey to stop smoking.

I got a little drunk. I was surrounded by smokers. I didn't even light up a cigarette. I even gave my old pack to a party-goer because he ran out of smokes and I no longer needed them.

I'd like to give a ***big*** thanks to /r/electronic_cigarette for introducing me to vaping, *and* to /r/stopsmoking for all the support and advice posted on this subreddit! I've tried to quit many times before, but this time feels real. I actually feel like I'm getting somewhere. I haven't had a single craving for a cigarette in ~~four~~ **five** days whereas I was formerly a pack a day smoker. I'm glad that I found this support group so that I don't feel so alone in my stop smoking journey. For the first time in a long time I can actually breathe in fresh air and taste food. It's such an exciting feeling!

I just wanted to thank you all for guiding me away from tobacco. I spent far too long killing myself. It's time I start living again. :)

**Edit: I can't count, apparently.**

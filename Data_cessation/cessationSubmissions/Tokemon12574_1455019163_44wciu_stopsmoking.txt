Constant two-week trigger overcome!

So, I'm sitting in Tokyo's Haneda International airport departures lounge, having spent two weeks snowboarding, drinking, and partying. Cigarettes here are roughly a fifth of what they are back home - on previous trips, I'd take full advantage of that fact, and would smoke pretty much non-stop. 

This season I was constantly assaulted by triggers. Smoking in restaurants, bars, communal areas... not to mention the contextual ones, like smoking on chairlifts, ciggie breaks halfway down runs, taking a moment (and a puff) when a particularly beautiful vista presented itself... and so on. Many times during this holiday I've thought "Fuck, I could go a ciggie right now".

But those thoughts were always chased out by reason and the power of conviction I have in my quit. I wanted cigarettes, but I did not want to smoke. 

And I'm really proud of that. Holy shit, am I proud of that.

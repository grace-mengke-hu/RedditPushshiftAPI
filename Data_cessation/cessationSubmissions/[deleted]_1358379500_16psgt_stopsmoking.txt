Stopped for 18 weeks now, how do I keep myself from falling back into it?

I have smoked for about 1.5 years before going to another country for 22 weeks for my study. At the beginning I was like: a fresh start, no more smoking for me! And 18 weeks later, I still havn't smoked. Those 22 weeks are (unfortentaly) almost over. So then I will be back in my old enviorment. How do I keep myself from getting started again?

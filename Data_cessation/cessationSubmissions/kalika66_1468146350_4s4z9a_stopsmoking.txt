I'm winning

This is my 4th attempt, having smoked for the past 19 years, averaging on 15 sticks a day, and more when I drink.

The longest I've lasted was 4 days, and my "withdrawal symptoms" were terrible in the past: had a fever during the 1st one, then bad headaches the 2nd, then insomnia from the last one. 

Then I just decided to quit 4 days ago, and after I put out my last cigarette I Googled cold turkey vs gradual, and I read a few articles (all of them pro-cold turkey). From those articles and this sub, I had a better understanding of my situation (nicotine addiction, cigarettes not really doing anything for me, it was all in the mind, etc.). And apart from the slight headache, very light sleeping, and sleepiness during the day, I was feeling fine, which really surprised me. I've had several cravings during the first 48 hours (I went on here and also checked the QuitNow app to keep myself motivated), but after that (I've also started reading Allen Carr), the cravings were not too bad.

I even held a cigarette earlier (I found it in my other bag) to test myself, and I had NO desire to put it in my mouth and light it.

Thank you guys for all the stories and encouragement, I hope that my post will be of help too.

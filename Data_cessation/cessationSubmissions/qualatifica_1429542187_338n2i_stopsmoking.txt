Cravings after 2 months.

I haven't had a cigarette in over 2 months. Which still blows my mind but for some reason I have had some crazy cravings this week. The only thing keeping me from going out to buy a pack is knowing that my bf will smell the smoke on me and be disappointed after so much support. I feel so much better now and don't want to go back but that pull is strong. Holding on for now...

Does anybody REALLY get to the point where cigarettes repulse you?

Last year I quit for a solid 4 months, no nicotine whatsoever, however I "relapsed" whilst on holiday with friends in Vietnam. Looking back I remember there was no coughing on that first hit back, it was literally like seeing an old friend again...I proceeded to smoke in excess (pack a day easy) for the remainder of my trip, timed it out so I would run out at the airport in South Korea before I landed back in the states.  9 days later still no cigs, but the plain and simple fact is I can stay off em, but I am probably going to be an addict for the rest of my life.

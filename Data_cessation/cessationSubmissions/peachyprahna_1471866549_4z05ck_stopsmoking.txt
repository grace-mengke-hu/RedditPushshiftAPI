finally admitting to a rewrite

I'll start by letting you guys know I defeated the nicotine beast 16 weeks ago today, so thats about 3 and a half months ago. What this means is that I no longer wake up in the morning with a soulless craving for a cigarette or have to satisfy this craving at any other time in my day to day routine. Smoking doesn't cross my mind almost at all anymore. Apart from in a very sneaky specific situation. 
Drinking socially. At the beginning I was convinced I had defeated the urges of smoking and had this false illusion of control and so didn't see it as enormously problematic to nab a few cigarettes off of smoking friends when out at a pub/house party/whatever. Sure, I woke up with a sore throat and increased anxiety and sometimes a little thought would nag at my brain that I needed one but all of this was easily dismissed with my supposed armor of self control. Now, I came back from a post/math-rock festival yesterday after 3 days straight of drinking, smoking, and toking. What made me finally wake up to the fact that I was cutting corners was that I'd light a cigarette at the festival even in the morning where no alcohol was involved. Immediate heavy feeling of knowing this could so very easily spiral out of control and I could be back to smoking like before in no time at all.  So now its monday, haven't smoked today and wondering if you guys have any advice for some next steps, what kinda self talk to use & how to avoid relapses in future events of a similar kind? Or if someone's been a similar place, I'd love to hear your story. Its not always a linear journey but I think each detour enables us to learn and grow stronger.

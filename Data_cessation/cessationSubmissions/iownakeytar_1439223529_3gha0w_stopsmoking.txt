I'm not so sure about this.

I just want to make it clear that I do want to quit smoking, but I feel like I've set myself up for a relapse. I just want to get other people's thoughts on this.

My SO and I both need to quit smoking. For the last year, it's been this cycle of me buying cigarettes, and he smokes from my pack. He'll take one in the morning when I leave for work, ask for one as soon as I get home, and ask "can we share one?" a couple of times throughout the evening.

This past Friday, I didn't buy a pack on my way home -- primarily because I'm broke, and I refuse to put cigarettes on my credit card (one of the little ways I try to keep from throwing money away on this stuff.) I get home, and he's puffing away with our Good Friend. Good Friend (GF) always has smokes, and always offers them. So we're drinking, smoking, up late night, I'm exhausted because we were up late the night before. So we leave our friend's place, GF gives us one more smoke for the road. When we got home, I went straight to bed. SO smoked the last cigarette. 

I wake up Saturday morning, and SO is already going "this is it! We're quitting!" and I'm feeling a little blindsided. I didn't get to have my "this is my last cigarette" moment. I don't have any patches or gum or anything. I had a minor panic attack yesterday and I think it kind of scared him -- I'm not good at the cold turkey method, but that's what he wants to do.

Sorry for the length of this, guys. What it really boils down to is if I don't quit he won't -- he'll just keep bumming cigarettes from me for as long as I have them. But he wants to go cold turkey, and I can't -- major anxiety, to the point where I'm afraid it's going to affect my job. My boss has already commented on the difference in my mood/demeanor today, and I've had to go cry in the bathroom twice -- I haven't even been here for 4 hours.

How do I do this? Help??

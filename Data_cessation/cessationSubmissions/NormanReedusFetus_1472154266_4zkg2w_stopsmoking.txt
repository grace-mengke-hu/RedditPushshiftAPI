Craving after quitting 7 months ago

Just made an account because I don't know where to turn. I smoked about half a pack a day for about 5 years. I quit about 7 months ago cold turkey and after a horrible experience of depression and head fog, I was able to kick the damn things for good. However, recently I've been craving "just one" and don't know what to do. A lot of my friends smoke and they've been nice enough to stop me if I try but I'm afraid I'll relapse. 


My question is: 

Why am I having these cravings after so long? 

How do I prevent myself from smoking?

What do I do if I accidentally give in?

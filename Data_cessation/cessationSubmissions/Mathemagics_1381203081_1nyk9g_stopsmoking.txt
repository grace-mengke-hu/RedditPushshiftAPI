I have almost forgotten that I used to smoke.

It's been 2 months now since I stopped smoking, and it honestly seems like a long time ago. Every now and then after a big meal or a few drinks I'll get a little edgy/anxious, but I calm down pretty quickly and usually without realizing that the feeling I'm experiencing is the desire  for a cigarette. 

At this point, most days I forget that I used to smoke all the time, and only occasionally now does the memory that I used to smoke pop into my head, and usually I just laugh about it and move on. It's only started to feel this way in the last week or two, so I'm just now hitting a good stride. Before that, it was really tough. 

This subreddit was a tremendous help to me when I first quit, and I suggest those who are in their first few weeks to stick it out, it gets better and better every day. You have so much to gain! I have been working out regularly now, and eating healthier as well. You'd be surprised how happy and content I feel even when I'm just sititing around watching TV. I laugh more, I FEEL more, and I love myself so much more. It's a continual journey that I could fall off at anytime though, so I try to not be complacent. I just try to remember that this good feeling is too good to ruin over something as stupid and trivial as a cigarette. 

I'd also suggest getting a quit smoking app for your phone, it was a great tool that I used when I wanted to get my mind off a craving and/or to remind myself what was at stake. Thank you all for your support and wisdom over my continual journey!

Did I fuck badly? I'm 22 and I was in a room

Hello.

I don't smoke but I live in a place where a lot of people smoke and many of my friends smoke. yesterday I was at a party at a friends house. 4 people smoked about 10 cigarettes each for 5 hours.

I feel really. I feel like I have now breathing problems and my life expectancy is shortened. I'm 22. I also take drugs because of I have very high anxiety

My doctor told me to make friends and to meet new people but I feel like I have now breathing problems. Did I just catch a cold during the night? Smoking for 5 hours doesn't hurt you that bad right? Am I just crazy? 

I'm sorry, this is embarassing. I have very few friends and I have very high anxiety. 

Thank you so much. I apologize if this sounds stupid. 

**TL;DR :** Was in a room with a LOT of smokers for about 5 hours. They smoked maybe 60 cigarettes. I read on the internet (medical websites) that even short term expositions damages vital organs. I also have high anxiety. I feel I don't breath as well as I used to , I'm quiet sure it's not in my head. I'm freaking out.

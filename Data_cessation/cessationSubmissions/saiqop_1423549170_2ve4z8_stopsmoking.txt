just take the decision and mentalize.

Before graduating i made the decision: Once i get out of college i will stop smoking. A month before graduation i started mentalize i was going to quit, so i enjoyed my last cigarretes and once i became an engenieer i stop putting cigarretes in my mouth, and that is the trick. i have carvings and a lot of my friends still smoke in front of me, but i tell to myself "it's ok to want to smoke, as long as you don't put anything in your mouth". I have been in the worst case scenario were everyone in the party smoke and i just don't put anything in my mouth and that seems to do the trick. All of my smoker friends belive i have this unhuman power of will, but if i can, anyone can, i used to smoke a pack every 2 days and just like that i quit.

i smoked for 4 years and now i have 2 months that i quit, i have been in the worst case scenarios and i'm 100% sure i won't be back.

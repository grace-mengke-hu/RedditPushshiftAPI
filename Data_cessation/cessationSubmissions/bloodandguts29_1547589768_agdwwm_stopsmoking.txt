Halfway through day 2 and feeling manic?

Hi all, I’ve tried quitting smoking and vaping several times. I’m trying again to quit...I’m halfway through day two and I feel a bit manic (VERY good mood, overly chatty, very productive). It’s important to note that while I have never been diagnosed with BPD, my Effexor sometimes gives me bipolar like side effects (particularly when I do not sleep). Has anyone experienced this before? I’m not sure if it’s due to the nicotine withdrawals or an Effexor side effect that has been triggered.

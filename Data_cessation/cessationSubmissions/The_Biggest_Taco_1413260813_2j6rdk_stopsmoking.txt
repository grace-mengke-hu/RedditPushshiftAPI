Please help me.

I've been smoking for about two years now.

A little bit of background helps I guess.  I started my freshman year of college and after about 1 week, I decided that I didn't like it and didn't touch a cigarette for about a year.  Two years ago (mid sophomore year), I started smoking 1 a day to help to deal with the stress of school/depression and a failing relationship.  I smoked one a day for about 8-9 months before my relationship completely fell apart and i started smoking 2-3 a day while trying to justify it.  Before long (around 1 year ago) I found myself at 1/2-1 pack a day - constantly fluttering in between.

Before I started smoking heavily, I was big into exercising - lifting and running, I was able to run a 4:45 mile and was training myself to hit 4:30 - just trying to exercise to help with depression.  Well, I was walking home from the bar a few minutes ago and it started poring rain (mind you I've still been working out) - I tried to run home but only made it about an eighth of a mile before deciding if i kept going my lungs might collapse. 

After all of this, I look back and I'm very angry with myself but that doesn't seem to be enough to put down the cigarettes so I'm calling out - pleading - basically begging on my knees: Please help me find some inspiration, something, anything to help me quit.  I'm sick of cigarettes but the addiction is strong.

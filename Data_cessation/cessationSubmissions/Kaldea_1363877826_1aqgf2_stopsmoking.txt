90 days. 3 months. First smoking dream. Dafuq?

So yay, 90 days cold turkey. I'm happy. No unbearable cravings, you all have been an immense help. 

But what the hell, brain? I've only had dreams (that I'm quite proud of) about being around smokers and NOT smoking, as well as helping them get on the right mind set to quit themselves, but never a dream about me smoking. Until tonight. 

I have been in a good deal of pain from a nasty fall I took when out running with my dog last week, so my sleep hasn't been great as it is, but I found myself dreaming that I was bumming a smoke from a coworker and smoking the whole thing down to the filter and feeling as guilty about it as if I cheated on my SO. What a terrible, terrible feeling. 

Has anyone else here experienced these dreams later into their cessation? I really would love it if this doesn't become a regular thing; my dreams are always so realistic that I sometimes find myself going a large chunk of the next day unsure if the events have really happened or not. (reality and the dream world are too similar to me most of the time)

Anyways--- I've seen some huge numbers posted today and it's made me smile. Go you! Go us! <3!

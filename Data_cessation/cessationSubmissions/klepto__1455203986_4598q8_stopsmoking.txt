Been smokeless for 3 days, need advice

So I've been really sick for the past 3 days and I couldn't smoke a single cigarette because of a sore throat, so I figured this will be a perfect opportunity to quit. As of right now I don't really crave for nicotine, but it seems to me that my alertness and focus is much worse compared to how it was a few days ago, this really ruins my productivity and makes me want to light up a cigarette. So I'm looking for general advice on how to maintain good focus/productivity while waiting for withdrawal effects to wear off, thanks!

Panic attacks returned (vent)

6th day smokefree.
Little background: I have bipolar disorder and panic disorder which manifests itself also (but not limited to) hypochondria.

I was able to beat my daily panic attacks a few months ago.
Now that I don't smoke anymore I again get these horrible things.

Fearing heart failure/attack/et cetera is most common for me during panic attacks. 

They usually follows this pattern.
I start questioning my health &gt; I fear I have something deadly, that will kill me fast &gt; something triggers me (sound, feeling etc) &gt; Panic Attack.

The last one was like this, 10 mins ago.
(I had walked all day and my feet looked like it) I watched a vein in my foot and though that there must be blood clot, I remember that I was once told that blood clot can go to your lungs/heart and kill.
I was going to shower and the feeling of water triggered my panic attack (shower is surprisingly common).

 I was also having a strong craving on since  my psychiatrist had left me pissed off.

Cravings induce very strong, albeit rather 

short, panic attacks. 
Well, nothing is stopping my from quitting as long as I stay rational but you can believe how much this sucks.

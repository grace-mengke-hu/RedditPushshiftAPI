48 hours 47 minutes

I decided to quit smoking after 11 years. Im up to a pack a day and really close to chain smoking. I want to take care of myself for my family and myself as well. I've tried before but I've always failed because I would give into the craving for a cigarette about a week or two into the attempt. This time, I'm going to do my best to not allow myself to smoke for any reason. I'm going on day 3 now and there have already been so many situations in which I just NEEDED a cigarette but I didn't smoke one. I'm feeling strong right now but I know the cravings are gonna get worse in the coming weeks. To motivate myself more my wife and I agreed that I could take the Mony would spend on cigarettes and put it aside to but computer parts and that's helping somewhat. I just get to the point to where I don't know what to do with myself when a craving hits. I get bored and I miss the social interaction as well but it feels really awkward to stand outside with the people I know that smoke when I'm not joining. They don't make it awkward though, which I'm grateful for, and I know it's just my anxiety. I'm just feeling kinda lost and confused and not sure how to fill that 5-15 minutes it would take to smoke a cigarette, you know? Anyway, just wanted to get that off my chest and share with a community that can relate. Thanks!

Had a close call last night

Had a date night with my SO. I had a couple of beers and a cup of spiced cider. He has been great about not smoking around me but having a buzz and knowing he had cigarettes was so tempting. I was in the process trying to bribe myself into not smoking with some kind of a reward when I decided I needed to just get over it. I told him to go smoke and I distracted myself until he was done. By the time he came back the craving has passed. Whew! I will have a talk with myself ahead of time the next time I drink, I think.

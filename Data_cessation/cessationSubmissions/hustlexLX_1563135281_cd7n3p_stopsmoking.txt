I will challenge my will and quit cold turkey, wish me luck.

&amp;#x200B;

I am 19 and I smoke too much, I am constantly scared about getting cancer from smoking (I know you can get it as a non smoker) my Grandpa smoked and now has cancer, my father smokes also, I am scared that he will get cancer, so today, I thought "don´t be a pussy" and decided to try to lay down Cigarettes, I´ve always been a quitter, so I may aswell quit smoking. I am only fucking 19 years old and I already feel my penis not receiving enough blood, it doesn´t get fully hard anymore, I smell like disgusting smoke, my teeth are already yellowish, my skin is bad and I can´t smell things that well anymore. I managed to quit before, but this time will be permanent.

I wish all others trying to quit luck and willpower.

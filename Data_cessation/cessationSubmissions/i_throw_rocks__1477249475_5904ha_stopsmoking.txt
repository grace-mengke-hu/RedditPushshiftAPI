How to stop justifying not quitting

I am feeling stronger than usual today, so I decided to quit smoking (again). I want it to stick this time, but I have an issue where I justify giving in when it gets hard.


My thoughts go like this:

- 1 cigarette won't matter

- It wont matter if I smoke now and quit tomorrow/next week. What's another week?

- I should quit during a less stressful time in my life anyways so it won't be so hard

- I should buy a pack and quit later, my grouchiness is driving everyone crazy


How do you combat these thoughts? I quit for 3 months in the past but started again when I hit a deer and couldn't find my ecig (which I keep for emergencies/really strong urges.) I'm feeling really strong today so I really want it to work this time!

Edit: Any tips for not smoking around smokers? My fiance smokes, and my sister (who lives with us) vapes. It's tough to see them smoking/vaping because it reminds me of how much I want to smoke and relax.

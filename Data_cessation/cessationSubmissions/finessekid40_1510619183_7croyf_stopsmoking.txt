Opinions on Juul for quitting cigarettes

I have been a smoker for over 5 years now and have never tried to quit before. I have been strongly considering switching to a Juul and giving up the real thing. One of my roomates has a Juul and I find that when he lets me take a puff or two my urge to smoke the real thing disappears. I was wondering if anyone who switched to Juul found it affective? It is the first e-cigarette that I have ever considered purchasing as most e-cigarettes don't do it for me. Would love some helpful advice/opinions.

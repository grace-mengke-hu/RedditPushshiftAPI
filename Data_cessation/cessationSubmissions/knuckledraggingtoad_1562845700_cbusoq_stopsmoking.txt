The end of my deployment

I am coming to the end of the most stressful deployments I have ever gone through with the US military. I smoked a pack a day for the entire 6 months. I have have never posted here or been here but I just wanted to share a scary thought I had if y'all would like to hear it. 

In order to out process a deployed location you have to report to a building where you will stay for about 4 to 5 hours. During this time you are unable to smoke or go outside of the building whatsoever. I realized since we are going straight from that building to the air craft which is going to be a 7 hours flight, that puts me at around 12 hours with no cigarette. As soon as I am off that plane my beautiful wife and 4 year old son will be waiting for me, whom they haven't seen in 6 months and I was thinking to myself how I'm going to explain that I needed to smoke a cigarette before we went anywhere. By myself. Since my son and wife won't be around cigarette smoke. I can't tell you how big of a piece of shit I feel like for even thinking that. I have never even really considered quiting, but I just bought patches and I think I'm going to actually try. I have to now. I realize now how fucked up my mind is and it needs to change. 

If you read this far and remember what got you through the quit, please give me some advice as this may be very difficult. May e the gum instead or a vape? I just have no idea how to stop. Wish me luck.

Reached 2 months and didn't even notice till today.

I tried to quit before at least 50 times. I always cracked within a few days. My chest was starting to be too congested and I"m only 29. Everything came back clear from the x-rays I took but It's getting better. 

It's weird I don't have cravings I just have those moments where my mind goes back to the moments I cracked and smoked cigarettes. It keeps saying "Remember this dumbass'.

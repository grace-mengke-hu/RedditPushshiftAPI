Crazy Rages.

I am 9 days into quitting, and I have been having insane moments of rage.

I've always had a bit of a temper, but lately the smallest things have been making me snap. Things that would not have bothered me at all before, or only bothered me minimally, are now causing me to have almost black out rages.

Anybody else have things similar to this? It is frankly frightening me a little.

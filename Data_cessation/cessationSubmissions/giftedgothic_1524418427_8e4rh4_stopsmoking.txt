Using a vape to quit— when to drop nicotine levels?

Hey y’all. I’m trying to make an attempt to quit smoking, and last time I successfully quit I used a vape. However it was a pretty shitty pen, and it broke before I could get down to 0mg. I was also broke and a pack of cigs was cheaper than a new mod.

I got a better one last night and have a bottle of 12mg nicotine now. My question to those who have quit nicotine via vaping— how do you know when to drop the levels? I’ve been searching on here and it seems like some people drop it and start vaping more to compensate. 

My goal is 12mg to 6 to 3 to 0, if that helps.

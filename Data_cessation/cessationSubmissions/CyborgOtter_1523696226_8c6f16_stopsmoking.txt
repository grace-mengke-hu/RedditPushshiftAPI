Using This Sub To Cut Back on Weed

Hey guys,

Theres really no sub for this and you guys are the closest ones so I guess Ill post here. Ive been a mutiple time daily weed smoker for 6 years now. Todays my 26th birthday and all the self reflecting going along with it makes me realize I dont want to be a person who does that anymore. Ive got a Japan trip coming up and dont want to be craving weed while Im there. Plus Im coughing a fair amount.

So starting today Im trying to cut back to a 2x a week smoker(I still like weed and dont want to quit completely.) I dont drink so weed is really all Ive got intoxicant wise plus all my friends smoke. Am I fooling myself with moderation?  

Anyway guys, I just wanted to post and thanks for any comments/advice.

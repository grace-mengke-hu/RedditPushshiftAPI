Cigarette free since Tuesday

3 days 9 hours and 7 minutes to be precise.   I now wake up, and smoking isn't the first thing I think about... but I'll be damned if it isn't 10th thing I think about.  I am going nuts! I exercise, which helps.  I bird watch, which helps, oddly enough, even more than the exercise.  

My wife and I both work from home, so we can watch out for each other.  It was an impromptu quitting.  She decided she wasn't going to smoke any more, and I stopped a day later. 

Unfortunately, while I feel good about quitting - my mind is constantly drifting towards the possibility of "just one or two".   I know where that will lead.  I know I'll feel like crap.   Addiction does have a way with playing with your mind.

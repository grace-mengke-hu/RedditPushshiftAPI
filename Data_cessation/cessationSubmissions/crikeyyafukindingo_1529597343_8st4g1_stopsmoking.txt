Something that helped me when I quit smoking

I quit smoking nearly 5 years ago using a vape then I quit the vape nearly 3 years ago. Quitting vaping was hardest because a) it was a huge nicotine addiction and b) I basically replaced a hand-mouth habit with another hand-mouth habit and quitting everything leaves that empty feeling when you are used to putting hand to mouth all the time. 

Anyway, what really helped me in those first couple of months was having a bag of baby carrots with me all the time. Especially when doing something where I would usually be smoking/vaping - like driving a car. I had so many baby carrots it was crazy (and delicious) and it got to the point where I didn't want to drive the car without any baby carrots. As the weeks went by the carrot consumption went down until I basically forgot about my baby carrot addiction a few months later. 

I feel like replacing the addiction with a new but healthy easier to quit addiction is what really helped break that urge. Focusing on the hand-mouth factor really helped - and using carrots helped control the overeating some people do when they quit.

Good luck to anyone quitting or thinking of quitting. Life is great of the otherside!

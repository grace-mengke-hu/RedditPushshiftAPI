0 Days - I panic every time I try to quit

Hey guys. Long-time lurker, with quite a few attempts under my belt, but I still can't shake it. 

I've got a particular problem - I'm a pretty anxious person, used to be medicated but I made a lot of progress getting over it. The problem is, not having cigarettes on me or trying to quit smoking triggers my anxiety big time. Before the chemicals even leave my system it becomes overwhelming and it's all I can think about. I end up going to buy cigarettes an hour after my last one just so I can turn my brain off and stop thinking. Anyone got any advice?

Can’t believe it’s been half a year!

I never, ever thought I would quit smoking. The most surprising thing is how easy it’s been. I went with nicotine gum this time after several attempts before this using other methods. I actually really liked the nicotine gum and only needed it for the first three months. I barely even noticed when I stopped using it. For some reason I still miss cigarettes and wish I could smoke any time I see them, but it’s easy not to. I know I can’t and that I would completely regret it. I’m almost to 6 months now and if I can do it, you definitely can!

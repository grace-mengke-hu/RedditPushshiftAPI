Anyone notice weird side effects after a few days of not smoking?

I find myself having old memories creep to the front of the thoughts the longer I am nicotine free.  I also randomly remember dreams or parts of dreams that I've had years ago.  I also have been more concerned with clutter lately, I have found some weird motivation to clean out everything in my house.  Is anyone else finding weird ticks like this the longer they don't smoke?  Is this something everyone goes through on their own?  I figured everyone has a different quitting story, I'd love to hear of anyone else's.

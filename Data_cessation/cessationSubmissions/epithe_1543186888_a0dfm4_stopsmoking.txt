Does switching to vaping count as quitting smoking?

I decided to quit 9 days ago, bought a vape, and haven't had a cigarette since, after smoking for 3.5 years and recently being at a pack a day. Last night I went to a party with friends who smoke and I didn't have a single one. I feel so much better, but also kind of guilty for not going cold turkey and instead using nicotine replacement. I do eventually want quit nicotine entirely, but this was the most I felt like I could handle. Can I still tell people I've quit if I've switched to vaping?

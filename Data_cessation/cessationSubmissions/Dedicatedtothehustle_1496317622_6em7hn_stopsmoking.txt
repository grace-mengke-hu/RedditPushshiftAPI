Trying to stop smoking with tremendous stress

Hey guys had stopped smoking for four months maybe 1 or two in the whole span while I was drinking.  However this year a family member that I've loved passed away unexpectedly and it threw me into a depression. 

Add that my job is incredibly stressful and this year I had two more friends get into accidents, car crashes and a whole bunch of drama in my life.  

I know I have to quit smoking.  What I'm going through is hard and I'm posting this to give myself some accountability.  Also any useful tips from guys who quit in high stress situations would be awesome.  Thanks!

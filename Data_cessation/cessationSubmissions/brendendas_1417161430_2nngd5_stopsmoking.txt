2 years of not smoking.

Started smoking in 11th grade. I was a pack a day smoker in a overall bad place, overweight and really unfit. Kept smoking till things got even worse eventually hit 97 kgs and my legs were barely usable. A few days before my mothers 50th birthday I asked her what she wanted, I told her that I would get her anything however absurd. She told me that she wanted nothing but for me to quit smoking. Her wish was my command. I quit that very day and here I am now. 

The first week was terrible and the first month was uncomfortable as everyone around me smoked. That's it! After the first month it was all smooth sailing. I had cravings whenever I would go out to drink but it was nothing not manageable. I started exercising in 2012 with 500m a day on the treadmill, worked my way up and now I can run 10kms easy on the road. I lost 21 kgs and hit 76kgs. Now I am at 82kgs. I have started to count calories (1200cals/day) along with running and I will hopefully start lifting soon. My goal weight is 70kgs. 

Keep at it guys the benefits outweigh the pain. It's all in your head.

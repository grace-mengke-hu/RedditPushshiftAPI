Body numbness?

Hey guys. So I quit nicotine cold turkey almost 2 months ago. I've been experiencing random body numbness the last month/month and a half. Like the weird tingly feeling when your leg has fallen asleep. I get it most often in my thighs when I'm lying down (lying down normally as I always have, not in some weird, uncomfortable position). Usually this is every night/morning. Also, maybe TMI, but after being intimate, at the end my whole body goes numb. Like my legs, feet, arms, hands, face, lips, etc. It doesn't last long. Maybe 30 seconds to 2 minutes max. 

Just wondering if this is normal after quitting smoking? Like something to do with circulation normalizing?

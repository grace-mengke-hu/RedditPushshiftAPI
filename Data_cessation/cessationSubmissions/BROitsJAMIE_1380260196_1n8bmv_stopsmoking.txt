No more

Beginning in January, I had quit. I didn't cheat. Not even once, and I made it until April-ish. I was so happy with myself, was feeling better....and then somehow I lost it. I didn't make the conscious decision to start smoking again, it just somehow happened. Here I am, when I could have been approaching 10 months (and close to a year) and I don't even have a day one anymore. I think about it every day, and I feel so trapped. I feel like I let myself down, especially when I think of the positive attitude I had about it, and how well my mentality was working.

I am not letting myself be disappointed anymore. I remember going to bed every night happy to tally another day. I have GOT to do this this time. I really think that my problem last time was that I got too cocky about it. I stopped checking back to this sub for support. 

Tomorrow is a new day one. The *last* day one, because I am not fucking up again.

Could use support and positive vibes!

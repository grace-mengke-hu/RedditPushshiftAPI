I smoked for 8 years, I'm 25 now and quitting. Are my lungs forever fucked though?

I know this is a newb question, but I need that kick up the ass to stick to vaping. I smoke about 5 packs a week. About 8 packs if I was drinking (quit drinking for good because of gallbladder removal). 

I'm getting 20 mg nicotine salts tomorrow because even 12mg has had a huge impact on cravings. I had four cigarettes today because walking around the town for hours and taking photos is how I keep active. I'm easily clocking 8 miles a day so I've always justified the smoking with cognitive dissonance by saying at least I was getting exercise. If I didn't have enough money for smokes I wouldn't even bother walking around that much tbh... 

I want kids and a long life. I look young for my age right now and don't have any wrinkles + my parents have aged well. I put sun factor 50 screen on everyday and moisturise every night but still smoke?? I already have asthma and have gotten pneumonia three times in the past 2 years. 

Is 8 years too much damage to bounce back from?

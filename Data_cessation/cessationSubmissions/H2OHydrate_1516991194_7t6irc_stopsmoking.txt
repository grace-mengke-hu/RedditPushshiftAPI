After multiple failed attempts, how do you tell your friends/family that you've quit again?

I've smoked around half a pack a day for about 2 years during which I must have tried quitting at least a dozen time. Each time, I was excited to tell my friends/family that things were going well, only to relapse within a few weeks or so. 

Eventually, they got tired of hearing it and stopped believing me when I said I was ready to change.

The support of my friends and family really helps motivate me, but at this point I feel embarrassed/ashamed to tell them that I'm attempting to quit again. I have a fear of relapsing again and having to own up to letting them and myself down once more.

Last night I even had a dream(nightmare?) where I smoked a cigarette with a friend and immediately felt shame and sickness wash over me. I was relieved to wake up and realize it was all in my head.

Can anybody relate to this?

Day 7

After 30 years of smoking and many failed attempts to quit, I'm back to day 7.  I find that the nicotine patches work really well for me for the first few weeks, but the cravings are still strong.  Some times, I can't imagine life without smoking, but for now, I'm off for a quick run to distract myself from how much this sucks.

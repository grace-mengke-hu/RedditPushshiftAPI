Day 2 Blues

Hello fellow nonsmokers: I am writing in need of support, or perhaps a pat on the back?  I just found out today that I didn't get into my top choice grad school program.  I've actually declined other acceptance offers, because I really, really wanted to go to this one.  I've been waiting for 6 weeks for the application results, and Day 2 just seems like the worst possible time to receive this information.  After arriving home this afternoon, I saw that I had mail.  I ripped open the letter, skimmed to the part about the rejection, and yelled, "You've got to be fucking kidding me!!"  One of my roommates called out to me excitedly: "Oh! Glitterymenace!  Did you get in??"  And I yelled back, "No!"  Then, I turned right back around and stormed out of my apartment, crying.  Through my tears, I noticed my feet actually walked the two blocks to the deli that sells "my brand."  But, they're not my brand anymore.  Because I gave up, "the only friend I've ever had."  My withdrawals (and menstrual cycle) are making me more melodramatic than usual.  I didn't buy a pack!  I kept walking, and I kept crying.  After sending a text to my long-distance partner, I headed home and binged watched Parks and Rec and ate some chocolate.  I may not be able to give up sugar, tv, or caffeine yet.  I may not practice yoga or go running as much as I like.  I may not relax as often as I need.  I may work way too much for too little at two jobs that I don't really enjoy.  I may not achieve every single dream.  But, goddamnit, I'm a nonsmoker now, and I'm pretty fucking proud that I didn't cave just for this.  Because I'm about to go ham on this Universe, and make some good shit manifest.  I've got to!  I've simply got to.

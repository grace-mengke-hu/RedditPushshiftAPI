Here I go again.

I got tired of feeling terrible, and realized that I'm actually ready to quit. I'm done lying to myself about how I need the breaks I get when I  smoke at work. 

Mostly I'm tired of the face my little boy makes when I try to show affection anytime after smoking a cigarette. 

Badge reset incoming. The final reset. 

Here I go again.

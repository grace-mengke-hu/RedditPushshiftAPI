Allen Carr’s book...

So I’m on Chapter 5. I just joined this group today. I’m following the advice in the book and not quitting until done reading. I’m not a heavy smoker. I can go a few days without a cig but when I drink... I’m probably a two pack a week smoker at most. But recognize anything is too much. 

Posting for people who have had success with the book and any tips/advice. In the meantime all of your posts are so inspiring!  Thank you!!

But, my sleeping is still awful. I'm averaging 4-5 hours a night since I stopped. There are no signs of improvement. I have no problem getting to sleep, instead I wake in the middle of the night and can't get back to sleep. I've tried camomile, lavender and valerian root. I've tried an eye mask. I exercise plenty. Please, has anyone got any tips, or can you tell me that it eventually gets better?

Second Day Smoke Free

I've gone 2 days, 2 hours and 40 minutes without a cigarette!  I'm proud of myself.  This is hard work!  I've smoked at least a pack a day for 31 years. 

I read Allen Carr's book and found it very helpful! I know the first 3 days are the roughest.  My mind keeps saying...just go have a smoke.  I'm kinda losing it currently.  I've cried a bit.  Gotten angry a bit.  Yes...I am a non-smoker and love that! However, the little monster inside of me is having quite a tantrum right about now. 

Can someone please tell me that this will be over by Tuesday or maybe even by tomorrow?

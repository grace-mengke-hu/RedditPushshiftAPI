Today my kids said 'well done for quitting'

They are 6 and 8. My youngest used to get upset when I smoked (he'd seen the packaging and asked what it was). I've been quit for 15 days now and today they both noticed (I didn't make a song and dance out of quitting) and their reaction made me sad that I ever put them in that situation. I grew up in a smoking household so it was so normal to me. I just hope I've quit in time to stop the damage to them. 

It's made me a calmer mum too. No longer constantly desperate to escape for a smoke. No more biting their heads off because I'm in a bad mood. I feel like a new person ðŸ˜Š

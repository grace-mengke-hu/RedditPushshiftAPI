Had a difficult night yesterday, but I overcame my strongest craving yet.

Last night I went to a birthday party at a brewery. Open bar, delicious beers, good company. I had a great time, especially since this was a mostly non smoking crew which meant I got to fully enjoy my new lifestyle. Then I had to drive home, and for some reason had every fiber of my being seemingly screaming at me for a smoke the whole ride home. Every gas station, every convenience store, every place I could stop to buy a pack was pure temptation.

I almost couldn't do it. So I started screaming. Just yelling as loud as I could, giving voice to my frustration in a bout of primal rage. It sounds completely ridiculous, but it worked! I got home, talked with some friends, and felt better. Woke up this morning and thanked myself for not smoking. Incidentally, has anyone else noticed that hangovers are much more mild after quitting? 

I've been trying to live my life as normally as I did before quitting, but drinking is still the hardest time for me. I hope it gets better.

It is possible to eliminate smoking from your world view in a very short period of time. 2nd try at a post.

I tried writing a post this morning. That post came off badly because it sounded like I was ego-stroking and didn't care about new quitters. Not my intent. I was trying to say something that should be quite encouraging. Here's my 2nd try.

I have quit for over 30 days, and I am finding it difficult to remember what it is like to struggle with smoking. This is not ego-stroking. I don't even feel pride about this. Smoking just doesn't enter my brain, like it used to every 30 minutes. I say this because I want you to know this, that if you quit resolutely, you can be free completely very quickly.

I may be over-confident. Someone said this happens at the 30 day mark. I appreciate the caution. It is true my guard is down and maybe that makes me vulnerable. I do not deny that I could screw up, in which case I will eat my humble pie and come back to this wonderful forum that has been so helpful during the early hard part.

Honestly, with all respect to recent quitters, I find it difficult to offer fresh new ideas. I wish new quitters a fast and easy escape. But I'm losing touch with the battle. Should I stop posting?

Allen Carr said it all. It may interest folks to know that in Allen Carr's lesser known and larger book, The Only Way to Stop Smoking Permanently, he relates how he completely lost touch with smoking addiction. He actually started smoking again so he could remember what it was like for smokers, so he could help them (not recommended).

New quitters, I wish you the state I am trying to describe here, the one in which you no longer care about smoking at all. You can be there in short order.

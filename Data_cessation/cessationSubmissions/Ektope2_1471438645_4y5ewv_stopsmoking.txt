Any Advice would be welcome

As the title says I need advice. I have been smoking for 5 years now and I notice the impact on my health. 

I work in IT so I spend a lot of my time sitting down. recently I have started gaining weight and getting short of breath. I want to quit smoking before I turn to serious exercise.

I easily smoke 6-10 cigarettes a day, I'm just looking for the best tips on slowing down and eventually stopping.

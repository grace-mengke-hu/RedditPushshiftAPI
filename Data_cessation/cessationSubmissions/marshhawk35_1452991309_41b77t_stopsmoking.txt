Guess what's back?

Three days of zero cravings. And then this afternoon, I went into crave city and it will not let up. Feels like I've been dealing with one long, anxiety-ridden, irritable craving for about 5 hours now.

I sort of know what started it, although I certainly didn't expect that would be an issue.  And I know I'll just ride it out because I don't actually WANT to smoke, but damn. Just when you're feeling confident....there's nicotine's ugly assface at the door.

I'm just posting to keep myself accountable. Keep on fighting the good fight, everyone!

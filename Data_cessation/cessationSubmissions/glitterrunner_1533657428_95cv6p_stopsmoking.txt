Day 2

I wasn't a heavy smoker.  Half a pack a day.  But its been 30 years.  There was a decade where I was smoking pack a day, but last 10 years, nope.  I even 'quit' a time or two.  Never lasted.  Thing is all I can think about since yesterday morning is that OMG I CANT EVER SMOKE AGAIN...when before I didn't think about when I could smoke.  I'd smoke a couple in the morning, none all day until like 7pm or so after work and my usual workout.  How can I stop THINKING about it?  I am bound and determined to make it this time!!!

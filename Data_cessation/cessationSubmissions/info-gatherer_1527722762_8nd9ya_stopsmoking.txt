Almost 2 months in and I see great improvement!

First of all let me say I vape, so I still have nicotine addiction. But! It’s been almost 2 months since my last cigarettes and I notice great improvements (I smoked 1 pack a day):
- I cough maybe five times a day instead of twice a minute
- When I do sports (I play tennis) I last much much longer before being tired
- my teeth look healthier
- I don’t know if this is just my imagination but I don’t lose hair anymore. My hair look thicker
- Smell and taste improved a bit (I guess not as much as cold-turkey quitters but it’s noticeable, especially smells)
- I don’t reek, my clothes smell clean
- I have more energy overall!

After 90 days without cigarettes I will try to remove nicotine from my e-liquids.

I often read this subreddit, thanks for your inspiring stories. And good luck to anyone struggling with cigarettes, you can do it!

5th day, and I'm incredibly frustrated.

My husband and I agreed to quit smoking together (we high-fived on it!). All week he's been leaving me under the impression he hasn't been smoking; however, I found it suspicious that he didn't seem to be "freaking out" like I was the first three days. Now that the weekend is here and we're not at work, the truth is out. He hasn't quit. Not only has he not quit, but he smokes in the car while I'm there, and leaves his packs of smokes lying around the house. I talk to him about how much I'm struggling, but also the changes I've noticed since I quit 5 days ago (improved sense of smell, etc), and he never has a kind or encouraging word to say about it. He just sort of nods and changes the subject. I'm just incredibly lonely in this and very frustrated. Just needed to vent, I guess.

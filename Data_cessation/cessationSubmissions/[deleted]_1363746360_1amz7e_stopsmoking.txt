77 days

Been quite a long time... The way I did it? I spent exactly a week in bed, doing nothing but watching the Wire, reddit and the like. I appreciate that most of you have jobs e.t.c but if you get a week off, lie in bed.  It will be horrible. You will go mad. But after that, life will just about function, and after 2-3 weeks you will be pretty much back to normal. The real plus is... if you don't smoke your hangovers won't be as bad. So you can drink more. Yea

Been more than a year since I quit..I didn't even notice!

I feel like the time went by so quickly. Over a year ago I was smoking 32 Cigs on average a day, for 7 Years. Now its been a year and I haven't even slipped up! I realized today I haven't though about a cigarette in so long I forgot what a nic craving was like. I'm free!

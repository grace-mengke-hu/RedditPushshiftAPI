Emotions are out of control

I've been nicotine free for almost a month, but I'm still an emotional mess. I constantly have uncontrollable crying fits when something stressful happens. It's wearing on my relationships and most of all myself. Cigarettes have always been my go-to drug for controlling and regulating emotions and now that I don't have them anymore, I just get completely overwhelmed by emotions when they come. I don't really crave cigarettes anymore but I don't know how to handle these feelings without them. I thought this would last for a week or something like that, but it just keeps happening. How long did your emotional chaos last when you quit?

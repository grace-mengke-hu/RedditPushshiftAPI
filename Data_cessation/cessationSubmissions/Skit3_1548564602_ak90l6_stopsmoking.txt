Hi everyone

Just finished my birthday party and it was so much fun, we drank good wine ate well.

I've benn 1 year and 22 days without smoking but today I smoked a cigarette. I, as I suspected, still love smoking but I know I won't smoke again tomorrow. The addiction is gone.

I'm so glad I smoked and even though it was good, I have this feeling, I'm free from smoking.

I get I'd people downvote me, I just had to share.

Keep up the struggle if you ate new here, it's hard but it's worth it.

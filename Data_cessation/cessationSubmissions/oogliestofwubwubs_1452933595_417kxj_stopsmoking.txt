Smoking Dreams

8 months in and I had my first smoking dream last night.  I'm still processing why and what it was all about.  I think I'm overly stressed and trying to figure out how to release that stress without smoking.  

I think I might take up walking.

ANYWAY. Still going strong!  I think about smoking now and then.  Tonight, driving to work, I thought how easy it would be to just sneak one cigarette. No one would know, etc...  I stared at them at the gas station when I was paying for coffee but I did not buy any.

I'm proud of myself.  I'm really doing it this time.

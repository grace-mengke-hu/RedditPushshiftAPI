365 Days!

It's been a year for me without smoking (or drinking)! I could not be happier. Quitting has easily been one of the best decisions I have ever made. It really has been worth it. 

I made a habit of replacing smoking with Ashtanga Yoga and have had the best year of my life! Thank you guys for all the motivation especially at the beginning!

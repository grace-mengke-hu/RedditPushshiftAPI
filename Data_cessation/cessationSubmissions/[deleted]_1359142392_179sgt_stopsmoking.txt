I am trying to quit and having serious mood swings. Help?

I've been a smoker for about 9 years and the time has come that I need to quit, I don't want to quit but I know I have to, the cough is so gross. But my moods are just ridiculous, I will flip out over the smallest thing and then be embarrassed about it in 5 seconds. I am anxious almost all day and I want to cry half the time. I am doing this cold turkey and it's proving to be WAY harder than I thought it would be. Anybody have any advice on how I can calm the fuck down without cigarettes?

Day 18 and a bit miserable

Things were going surprisingly well until about four days ago. Now I'm depressed as fuck. I also have horrible coughing fits (that make people stare), an occasional shortness of breath, some headaches, and I tire easily, and have difficulty concentrating.

I sorta thoughts these physical aspects would be fine by now -.-

On the other hand, I started running, that's nice. Not having to worry about the next smoke is kinda nice too (though quitting sort of took the structure out of my days, and finding a new one is kinda difficult). But other than these, I really couldn't list any positives of being a non-smoker.

Ho-hum. Sorry about the moaning.

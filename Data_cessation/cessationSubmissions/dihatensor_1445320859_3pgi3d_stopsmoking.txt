Smoked half a cig in my 23rd day

Hi,

I feel guilty and I'm afraid I'll smoke again. It has been a great change in my life. Not only did my overall health improved -> my annoying cough disappeared, but I could improve my running, which really made a difference for me. Also, not so tired anymore, the stink in my mouth and the tongue irritation gone, the grease in my lungs gone. Why am I so stupid to go back to these stinky, horrible products? 

The past days (when week 4 started), I felt a bit like in my first days of not smoking. A bit paralyzed (quitters should know what I mean), heavy pressure in my head, my right side feels heavy as well. 

Please help me not to become a smoker again!
Thank you and wish you keep your quit!

Gum addiction?

So, I used to chew an average of 12 or even more gums everyday, and I ended up noticing I was having a bit of diarrhea, so I decided to not chew more of them.
And I've realized since I stopped, my urges of smoking have come back a bit hard. Is it normal? Should I come back to chewing gum?

p.d: they are normal gums, not nicotine ones.

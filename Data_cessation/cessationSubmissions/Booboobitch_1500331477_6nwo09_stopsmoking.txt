Tough

I quit smoking in November of 2016. I stayed solid until around January when I smoked three times. I have managed since then to not smoke. So about six or so months of solid not smoking. 

However, I am craving now more than ever. I honestly feel like my skin is tight, like I am trapped, it is actually crazy.

Idk what I am here looking for, maybe just understanding. I had thought by now not smoking would be easier but it isn't, and I feel more and more lost without it.

I haven't cracked yet but I feel it coming.

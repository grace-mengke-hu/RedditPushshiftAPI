Did I ever smell like that?

So I had a house call to make today and both of the clients smoked inside.  I went to the bank afterwards.  As I was standing there I could really smell the cigarettes on me and I was like "OMG!!! Did I smell that bad when I smoked?"  

On the plus side of things I had no cravings being around 2 smokers.  Silver streak :)

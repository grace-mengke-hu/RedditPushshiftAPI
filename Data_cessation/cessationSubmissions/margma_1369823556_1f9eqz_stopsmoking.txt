48 hours! Or maybe four days?

Well, almost. Or more than almost! I had my last cigarette on Friday night around eight, held out for 48 hours and thought locking myself in the house with a tasty beer would keep the demons out. I then finished my beer and went fishin' for those cigarettes outta the trash can like a real fine lady. The next morning I smoked two in that sort of Whatever-look-how-much-I-don't-need-you-guys way, and 
then went on a run. Smoke free since but it has been the pits. Any word on when this will ease up a bit?
I'm 24 and I've been smoking about a pack a day for almost eight years. For the past few months I have cut myself down to between 5 and 10, which was absolute hell.

I read Allen Carr's book and had a fair number of doubts about it. I've kicked the crap out of some other distasteful addictions and found that to be problematic when reading it (The sort of "You smoke cigarettes but think about heroin addicts! You'd never, right???" attitude). Did anyone else find this troublesome or unhelpful?

I don't know you guys! I'm just writing because I'm drinking coffee and its thunderstorming out and normally I would be all over that porch smoking cigarees.

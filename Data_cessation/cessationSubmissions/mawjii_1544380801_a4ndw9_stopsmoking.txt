New quitter here struggling with nicotine withdrawal. Need advice please.

The country I live in has easy access to cigarettes and is really cheap. But, there’s absolutely nothing to help with nicotine withdrawal and today’s day three for me. I’m now suffering from all kinds of withdrawal and there’s no means to relieve those except cigarettes.

I feel sick, abdominal pain, tingling, depression(although I had it already but worse now and yesterday I broke down and cry to my gf like crazy). What should I do?

I’ve smoked 30 cigs a day for almost 6 years.

Guilt

So, I decided to quit last night, with a final cigarette in my pack. I made it through most of today, all while thinking about having a smoke. After leaving work, I caved and bought a pack to simply get my mind off of not being able to smoke. I now have a nearly full pack in my pocket, along with a whole lot of guilt. Anyone been here before?

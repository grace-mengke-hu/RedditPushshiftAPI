One day I'll feel the bottom of my lungs again

I had a dream last night where I had decided to quit. This is new for me, as in my dreams as of late it's been the opposite. So upon waking I gave it a shot. I made it through the first hour. And that was as far as I got.

This saddens me. I'm finding myself feeling an extreme amount of anxiety towards the whole situation, even though I've done this before. A few years ago I opted for the laser therapy treatment and it worked. Though I still experienced cravings throughout the first month, I was able to say no. I was smoke-free for a year and a half and it was one of the most euphoric feelings not to have that *need*.

All I want is to get back to that, but can't seem to bring myself to push through the initial transition. I've never tried using the patch, so am thinking that might be my next approach.

I don't really have any questions, just felt the need to place my thoughts on this matter somewhere. Thank you r/stopsmoking for being here to allow for that.

8 days no smoking, but gained 5lbs. Need help with snacks.

Hi guys,

Quit 8 days ago after smoking for 15 years. First couple of days and especially nights were rough, but it's already a lot easier. However, I'm putting on the pounds really fast and I don't want to replace smoking with eating. I'm already a few pounds above what I should be and I won't tolerate getting much fatter from here, but I will allow myself some leeway until the craving subsides. 

So I'm looking for good or "healthy" suggestions for snacks. I was looking for something like this in the store earlier, but I had no idea what to get and ended up with some feta cheese and some bananas. I'm not a big fan of chewing gum or boiled sweets, but I guess having some lying around wouldn't hurt. 

Anyway do you guys have a go to snack or any non-fatty ideas or suggestions?

Thanks!

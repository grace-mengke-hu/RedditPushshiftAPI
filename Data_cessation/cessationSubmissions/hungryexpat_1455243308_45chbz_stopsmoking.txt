Day 6 and I'm surprised how easy this has been.

I remember last time I quit (3 years ago) it being pretty challenging for me.  I think I had more cravings and I remember crippling insomnia.  This time I felt completely free by day 3 or 4.  Boyfriend quit with me and he hasn't whined once.  Amazing.  Should have done this a long time ago.

Two Years! I’m 34 male and smoked a pack a day for 12 years. Quit for a year then smoked for another. This quit, I went through six months of misery where I thought I had clinical depression and something was wrong with my head. There wasn’t, it was just the smoking. It gets better. You can do this!

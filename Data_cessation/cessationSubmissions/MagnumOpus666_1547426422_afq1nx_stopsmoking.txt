What would happen if you had one cigarette after quitting for a few weeks?

I quit smoking a little over three weeks ago. It hasn't been that difficult and I feel pretty great most of the time. But every now and then I get a really intense craving for a cigarette. Each day the craving comes back stronger. So, on the off chance that I crack and have a cigarette, what would happen? And I mean only one cigarette. Would I go through the withdrawal all over again? Would I get a craving for another one? I know by smoking one I'm treading on really thin ice, and I don't really intend on smoking one unless I'm completely shitfaced.

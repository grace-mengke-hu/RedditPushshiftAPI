I am so addicted to this garbage.

I had my first cig when I was 5 and I coughed like hell but felt this surge of calm energy. I didn't really get around to it again until 8 a couple more times, then by 12-13 I was sneaking one every few months which gradually increased to a pack a week by 16.   
I am almost 30 now. It needs to really stop. I quit once before for a year, and my dumbass started it again. My mom just recently died of lung cancer and I've had enough at this point. My bf smokes and I'm going to have to deal with being around it still while trying to quit which is going to drive me mad. I wake up every morning nauseous and dizzy until I light up a smoke. I'm tired of feeling like shit. I'm tired of wheezing and losing my breath while exercising before I can even break a sweat. I'm tired of being paranoid every time I get a strange pain/heaviness in my lungs. 
I have my ecig clutched up against me and I'm constantly hitting it but it just doesn't give me what I need. I feel like gnawing on my own skin and it's only been a day. I have to work one more day tomorrow then I have the next day off so hopefully I can get out and stuff my face with food (don't worry, I'm skinny) and impulsively buy things or something to take my mind off of it.

This is my second day. I am 64 years. smoked over 50 years

I am  64 years old male from Finland. I started to smoke in 1958. Yesterday morning I had to decide to quit smoking because I am having  hard time for breathing. I haven't been diagnosed by a doctor but I am quite sure that I have COPD. I am too nervous to write more. Wish me luck.

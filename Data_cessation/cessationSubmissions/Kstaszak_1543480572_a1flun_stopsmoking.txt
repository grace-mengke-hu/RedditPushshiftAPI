Day 10

Uhhhh.  Having a moment cuz I'm bored at work,  I hate working night shift cuz there is nothing to do.... iv stopped taking breaks at work too because I dont know what I should do besides maybe eat,  but that only takes 5 to 10 mins.  What do I do with the other 20 to 25 mins?  Might as well get back to work and get done early...  craving gone in less the 2 mins... hmm that's a new record.  Well nothing much to say right now.... I will update more later if there is anything I find new or unusual.

2nd hand smoke

Was in the car with my dad yesterday, he was smoking a cig thankfully the sun was shining and the car windows were rolled down lol we were doing some garden clearing and this was a run to the local skip site to dump rubbish, very associative as in the past I would have been sat in the passenger seat happily puffing away as well

Anyway the smoke from his cig sort of got to me , not in a really bad way but not in a really good way either. I could feel the yeuck of the smoke but also incredibly the kick of the chemicals at the back of my throat as I breathed in! Not enough to make me relapse (hopefully) but served as a warning for me - 2nd hand smoke could be enough to set the addiction off again , enough to start that cycle of craving off again

What do you think ?

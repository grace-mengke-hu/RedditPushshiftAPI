New years resolution quitting help

Hello and Happy New Years! 
Last new years I resolved to quit smoking cigs by switching to a vape and overall it has been pretty successful. Except, now I have found myself totally dependant on my vape. 

As a new years resolution, I want to cut my dependency so that I can just truly enjoy vaping for the sake of vaping. 

TL;DR: do you have any tricks for cutting my dependancy on vaping? anything that has worked for you in the past, or maybe any hiccups that you had in cutting back? 

Thanks a million

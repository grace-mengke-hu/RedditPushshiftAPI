Bad day and I'm back to square one

Completely lost my temper today, laptop just got fixed and I dropped it whilst open and it completely snapped. Ended up smashing laptop to pieces and going to buy cigarettes. 

48 days without a cigarette after smoking a pack a day for 6 years and I've gone and fucked it. I'm really fucking losses off. 

Sorry to rant but feel utter shame at ruining something I'd tried so hard to fix.

Followers of AC's EasyWay, a question for you

How much did you buy into what Allen says in the book? I'm happy to look at people smoking and be glad I'm not a smoker, am fully aware that it's an addiction not a habit and the phrase 'yippee I'm a non-smoker' is never far from my mind. But...and I'm not sure what my current quit badge says, but it's been 6 days and part of me wants a cigarette. This wouldn't surprise me, but Carr describes going through life like this as pathetic. He's clearly using a lot of psychology in the book and so I don't take that too much to heart, but how did you guys square your cravings with this section, when so much of the rest is instantly mind-altering? Hope this made sense :)

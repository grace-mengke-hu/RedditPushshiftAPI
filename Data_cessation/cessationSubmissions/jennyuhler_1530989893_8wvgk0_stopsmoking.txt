Thank you.

I saw a quote here that really fucking stuck with me, and ultimately helped me quit by changing my perspective. Something along the lines of, “it’s not the sunshine you miss, it’s the darkness.” 

When I had a craving, I realized I was missing so many parts of every day life that I enjoyed, and time with the people I care about. I want my life to be about the real joys, not some bullshit addiction that gives me fake gratification. 

I’m 7 weeks smoke free today, from a pack a day through college. Just went on my first run in several years, trying to get back on the marathon grind like I used to. It sounds crazy now to me to be able to run 26.2 miles, but so did the thought of being without the comfort of American spirits. I’m so happy I could cry. You can do it, start now and don’t give up!

Just put out the last cigarette... for the second time this week

I've been smoking two and a half packs a day for the last four years. I decided to quit for a few reasons, but mostly due to the fact that my mother smoked herself to death at age 43. I turned 22 this year and it hit me that I'm more than half way to 43 AND I smoke more than she did.

I tried to quit two days ago, but relapsed after being confronted with post-quit depression that was so intense that I went into full-on panic mode. I feel odd saying this to total strangers, but my life has been full of loss. I lost my mother who I knew very well as well as my father and brother who I knew very poorly. Also, this isn't the first addiction I've battled and I fear that in order to drop this habit, I run the risk of falling back into much more dangerous ones.

I know NRT is highly touted amongst members of this sub, but I'm a broke college student who has no ability to afford such luxuries, so I'm going cold turkey. I worry that the post-quit depression will cut me down yet again, but I know this is the right time to give up the habit and I want nothing more than sobriety from nicotine.

Does anyone here have any tips for someone struggling with post-quit depression on a low-to-no budget? I don't have the money for counseling or anything like that, so I'm kind of stuck.

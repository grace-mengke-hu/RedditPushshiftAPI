Okay. Who wants to make a pact?

It's just gotta happen. I'll never be able to have an easy quit the way I did the last time I had a good run, but if somebody feels like making a pact with me, I go to work in eight hours, and it might help to have a partner in waking up with no nicotine. What do you say?

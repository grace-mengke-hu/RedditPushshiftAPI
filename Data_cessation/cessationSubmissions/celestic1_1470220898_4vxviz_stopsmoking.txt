Need help on how to get my dad to stop smoking

Hey all, my dad is 49 years old and quickly approaching 50. He has been smoking since he was 18 and now smokes two packs a day according to my mom. My mom and I both tried to tell him to stop, but he wouldn't listen. His excuse is always if I just quit smoking all of a sudden then the symptoms of smoking such as cancer is going to show up faster according to my dad. Even though my dad was a dick to me growing up, I would like to see him live longer. Any tips/methods on how to get him started on the path to stop smoking would be greatly appreciated thanks all. And also can someone verify if you get the long term effects of smoking faster if you quit all of a sudden after smoking 20+ years?. I think my dad's excuse is obvious bullshit, but I just wanna make sure haha.

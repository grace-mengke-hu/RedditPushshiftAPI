3 Weeks 1 Day, proud but not encouraged

I've only been smoking for 3 years but recently decided I wanted to stop. So far it's been 3 weeks and 1 day and I feel pretty good about myself. I feel healthier and less anxious, which are signs of encouragement, but my girlfriend who quit 2 years ago hasn't given me the same encouragement I gave her when she was trying to quit. I know I'm supposed to do this for myself, but I don't know, it's hard sometimes to want to quit. I'm glad I found this subreddit, at least I can fight the good fight with everyone here. 

EDIT: I want to thank everyone who commented to encourage me today. I was in a rough spot but seeing your comments help me not reset to 0 today. Living with 3 smokers is tough, but I've gotta find my own motivation then relying on my SO. Thanks for the help everyone!

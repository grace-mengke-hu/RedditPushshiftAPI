Ex-smokers/current weed heads that used to mix tobacco with marijuana...what do you do now?

I am half way through Allen Carr's book and getting to the point of trying to finish so I can finally be a non-smoker. I grew up in Germany and have always had my joints with tobacco mixed in, trying to remove that last hesitation in my mind that is thinking I would still be giving something up which is my second "enjoyment"..having a joint. What worked for you??

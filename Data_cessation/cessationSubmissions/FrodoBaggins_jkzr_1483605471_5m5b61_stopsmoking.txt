Smoking cigs to e cigs to now quit.

I started smoking every day in 2012. Within months I decided to get an electronic cigarette. Vaped for three years, on and off smoking cigs when I couldnt afford e-juice and just got addicted to cigs again.

After about 3 months of smoking shitty cigarettes every day, I got a vape, and then I read something about how vaping destroys DNA or something like that, and decided to quit vaping too.

Since vaping was less satisfying than smoking real cigs I just decided to try and see if I could stop smoking and vaping altogether. 

I think its been three weeks.

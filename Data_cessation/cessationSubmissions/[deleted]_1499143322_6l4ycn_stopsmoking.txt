Proud of you!

The people who've been sober for hundreds of days? I'm proud of you!

The people who have been free for a few weeks? I'm proud of you too!

Those of you who are only a few days in, I'm incredibly proud of. 

And everyone who has just quit and is counting the hours, refreshing this subreddit, chewing gum, toothpicking, and losing their minds with emotions and withdrawals? I AM SO FUCKING PROUD OF YOU! 

And shout out to anyone who is still struggling, possibly smoking as they read this trying to summon the willpower and gritting their teeth. I believe in you, and just know that you CAN do it. It'll be hard, you'll stress, it's pretty common to relapse but DON'T GIVE UP. you have the power to kick this addiction and be a better, healthier version of yourself.

First time posting- 3 weeks in, 1 week off Chantix. I'm dying

I'd planned to start weaning off the Chantix at a month in and wean for a month. I was scheduled for surgery for next week, last week, so decided to quit the Chantix because it's a powerful medication that's hard on the kidneys and I don't want to take it on top of everything else they're gonna pump into me. Quitting smoking with the Chantix wasn't too terrible. Without it, all I do is cry, snap at my family, and feel completely miserable. I don't know how much longer I can live like this. I'm totally white knuckling and each day seems harder- not easier. I'm using a badge app, I exercise daily, drink a ton of water, eat pretty clean, and I'm trying to keep busy but I'm not doing well, Guys....

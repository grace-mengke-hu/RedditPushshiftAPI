I wonder if this is a placebo effect

Three days in, cold turkey, from an 8-smoke-a-day habit that's existed for many years. This must be a placebo effect, although I'm hopeful it will continue on. I've noticeably more energy, I've lost a few pounds, am going to bed at a decent hour instead of staying up for that last smoke, and am extremely positive about my chances at quitting successfully for the first time. Of course I'm even more irritable than my 8-month pregnant wife :)

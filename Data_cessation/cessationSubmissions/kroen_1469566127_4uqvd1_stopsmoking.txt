It's been close to 29 hours since my last cigarettes. I feel extremely weird and not at all what I was expecting

It's really weird, but I didn't get craving even once. When I smoked a pack a day I used to get cravings like 10 times a day. I do feel weird however. Kind of hard to describe. It's a feeling of disconnet, and kind of surreal. Like this is some kind of dream. Odd.

And now I feel myself breaking, and I'm not sure why. I don't feel the emptiness I usually feel which causes me to smoke. Instead, I feel slight dizzyness and like my head is heavy. Kind of after drinking, but without the positive effects of alcohol. None of this feels real. It's as if there's a crack in reality in my brain. I can't explain it.

How do you guys deal with emotions/fights/deep thoughts?

I quit (again) 5 days ago. Before that I have been smoking on and off for a month. I know it'll stick this time, I'm not going to "just smoke one" or shit like that. I'm done.

One small thing though; when I get mad at someone  (doesn't occure that much but it happens), I really need to cool off and get out of my train of thought. Smoking used to help. Also, when I needed to think something through, something important or something, smoking helped too.

I haven't been tempted, and I don't think smoking is a solution to anything. Just wanted to know how other quitters deal with this stuff.

Thanks guys!

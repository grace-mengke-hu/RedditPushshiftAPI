1 year smoke free today!

I am so excited and happy that I kicked the nasty habit and was successful in the first of many years to come.

I certainly feel healthier and happier than when i used to hooked to cigarettes. Looking back now, I can't believe that I let such a harmful thing control me and my life so much. I have literally avoided few people in my life just because I couldn't smoke when i meet them - it was a toxic relationship, and i am free from that.

For everyone out there struggling to quit - it is soooooooo worth it to quit. Your life will be much much better and free.

Good luck people!

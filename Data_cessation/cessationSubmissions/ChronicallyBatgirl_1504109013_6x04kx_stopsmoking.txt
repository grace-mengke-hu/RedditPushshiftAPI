Trying again

I have set a quit date 2 weeks from now, and I am so determined to succeed this time!

I know from my previous attempts that I need lots of mints and something to keep my hands busy. 

But I have two questions for all the experienced people!

1. Everything I read talks about cravings and how they come on very strongly and then pass. I've not really experienced this - I do have moments where I think I'll die if I dont smoke, but mostly I have what feels like a neverending mid level craving.  
Does anyone have any ideas to combat this? 

And 2. What do you think is the most important 'supply' you needed?

I am disabled so restructuring distractions around work wont do it, last time I played a lot of games to cope haha. My record is 6 days :/

Thanks in advance!

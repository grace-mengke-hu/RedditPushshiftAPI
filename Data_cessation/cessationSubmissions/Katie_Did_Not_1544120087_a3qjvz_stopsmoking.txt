I was told i could come here for tips and tricks to quit smoking?

I have smoked for half my life now. I quit while i was pregnant but started right back up when she was a few months old. My breathing problems are back. I keep getting sick and losing my voice. (I did not get sick once while i was not smoking.) I am headed to chicago tomorrow for a concert and i know i am going to want to smoke. Please give me all the tips and tricks you have!!!

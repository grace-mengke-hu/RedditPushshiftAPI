Week 1 check in...feeling amazing!

I quit cold turkey last week and have felt great ever since. The first couple days weren't fun, but I knew to expect that due to my previous attempts to quit. I would just like to introduce myself on here and let everyone know that I absolutely love being a non-smoker! 

Also, thank you for all of the great posts on here, they've been extremely helpful and a really good inspiration.

stuck in a loop .. Help !

Hello reddit, i've been a smoker for the past 7 years now, i smoke 1 full packet everyday, and i have been trying to stop since a year now. i have downloaded apps and read guides, but non of that worked out for me. im really frustrated, it feels like im being controlled by it. The thing is, everytime it comes to the scenario where i say this will be my last packet, or today will be the last day i smoke, then i wake up as if nothing happened.

its kinda weird that i realise i want to stop and i realise that my brain is postponing me stopping everytime. and still i dont know what to do about it.

Please if u have any suggestions or solutions, feel free. and sorry for the bad english.

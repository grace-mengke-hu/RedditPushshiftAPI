I'm scared

Ive always considered myself a passionate smoker... If you know what I mean.. I love being forced outside several times a day to escape the predicable onset. I love waking up every fucking morning knowing a coffee and a half pack of smokes with leave me in a state of nirvana.. No matter what.. After every meal.. after sex,, after a relaxing joint.. or a drink.. the list goes on forever..but I'm dying..I can feel it..  I read something in one of these (Stopsmoking) threads tonight that I think will help me perceive cigs how I need to in order to quit.... I hate to compare nicotine to blow. but I'm afraid that is what is about to go down. Alright, before you judge me and what not, let me make one thing clear, I don't do coke really ever. At best twice a year.. Now on to my comparison. Whenever I've done blow, once I'm done, I run from the come-down. In other words I embrace for a hard crash. I accept the longer I wait, the more the addicting chemicals will leave my body. Its all about how you perceive your craving. Their is not much in this world I fear, but living a life without smoking is one thing I do. God speed... wish me luck

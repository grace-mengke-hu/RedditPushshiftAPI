What impact does smoking 500 cigarettes in 2 years have?

So, I did some mental math recently, and I've smoked the equivalent of about 500 cigarettes during the last 2 years of college, which is much more than I thought. Half of those are actual cigarettes, the other half is about a dozen hookah sessions, which are apparently terrible. I would smoke after drinking, and I went through a period of about 6 months where I would smoke 1-2 a day. It has really added up. I also vaped very very heavily for 1-2 years.

All the benefits of quitting I've found online are for people who have been smoking for years. What kind of impact does this have on lung health, risk of cancer, etc...?

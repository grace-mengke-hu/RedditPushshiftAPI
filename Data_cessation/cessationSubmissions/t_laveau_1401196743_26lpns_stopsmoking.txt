Haven't had a cigarette in 9 months, sudden cravings recently

Hi stopsmoking,

I don't usually hang out around here. No need, really. I put down the cigarettes 9 months ago after 10ish years of smoking maybe a half pack a day, on and off. Much more when I was drinking. Put that down too. Recently, out of the clear blue, I've been having cigarette cravings! 9 months later! They don't ever go away, not fully. Cigarettes are one hell of a god damn drug. It's not the nicotine, that's easy. It's the comfort ritual of lighting, inhaling, and holding onto a lit reminder of your mortality. I think it's because I've been having relationship issues, maybe. I don't know what it it is, actually. I'm not going to smoke again. I'm far enough away from it now that it doesn't seem like an actual possibility. It's also much harder when you live in the South, where everyone smokes. Particularly the town I live in. 

Anyway. Yea. Quitting smoking is hard! Keep up the good work.

You are awesome! You are doing great!

Last December 5th I put my mom into a hospice bed and walked away realizing that was it. She will die and my kids will never know her. She started smoking when she was 16 and had a good run till LC caught up with her at 70. She tried to quit but...well, you know. It is really fucking hard for most. Anyway, whether you have been able to quit, trying to quit or are thinking about quitting, you are loved beyond your imagination by more people than you know and may the best in life be yours for as long as possible. Mom says so.

Quiting smoking AND nicotine lozenges.

I smoked about 1 pack/day for 10 years, then used lozenges to quit smoking for 3 months. Relapsed and never quit the lozenges because they were just as addicting and delicious as well. So for the last 2 years I've been smoking and taking 5-10 lozenges a day. Bad I know.  

Now I'm 3 days off both. It's been very hard. I've been dizzy, bitchy, eating everything in sight due to the oral fixation -even have flavored toothpicks to use for this. The craving doesn't last minutes for me, it's lasting for HOURS. Yesterday I had a panic attack. Today is a bit better but the nights seem harder for me. 

Anyone else dealing with multiple nicotine addictions?

Still going strong, but starting to feel super lazy! Is this normal?

I'm feeling great about quitting. Having spent my first week away from situations that I thought would make me want to smoke.. avoiding bars and big groups of friends who smoke.. this week I've been pushing myself to go out and be around smokers, and putting myself through the testing and difficult situations that I know I'll have to face. And each time I come out of it feeling stronger and more proud of myself. I haven't come anywhere close to giving in to temptation. I've had cravings, but nothing I couldn't handle. I'm really feeling good about it..

BUT.. I've noticed that I'm lagging generally. I feel pretty short on motivation, I'm tired and lazy.. and I just wanted to know if anyone else has felt similarly. Little things seem like loads of effort, I just want to mooch on the couch. Am I just being a slob? Or is this related to quitting?

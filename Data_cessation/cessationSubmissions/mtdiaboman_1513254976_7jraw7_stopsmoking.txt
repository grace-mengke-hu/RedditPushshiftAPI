Hours into Chantix

So I took my first  Chantix just  A few hours ago. After all the reading I've done on reddit and other places, I am considerably worried about the  Psychological aspects.   However after being on nicotine gum for 27 years I need to make some sort of move towards quitting.

 I'm seriously interested in the efficacy of this drug.  I currently to anywhere from 24 to 36 pieces of 4 Milligram gum every day. To put that in perspective, If I'm awake, I'm pretty much always chewing a Fresh piece of nicotine gum.
 My blood pressure when I chew the gum is extremely high and goes down to good levels when I am not chewing it for more than about 8 hours. So my nicotine addiction is quite real and trying to just wean myself off the gum without chantix causes huge physical symptoms like sweating and anger which can't be dealt with cold Turkey.

So we'll see!   This will be exciting.

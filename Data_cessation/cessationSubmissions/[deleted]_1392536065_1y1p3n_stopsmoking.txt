I'll be 20 next Saturday, and I want to quit.

Hey guys,

I'm currently 19. I've been smoking for a little under 2 years now (bought my first pack the day after I turned 18), and I want to quit. Quite badly. I currently smoke about 3 packs a week. I have depression and very frequent anxiety, and cigs helped me quite a bit with it, but now it's just a really lame habit.

I looked around Reddit for suggestions as to how others stopped, and most of the answers involved family. I have distant parents that I don't get along with and no girlfriend. I am surrounded by smokers at work and school, and *no one* has told me to stop but me.

I want to quit because of the health risks, the time it takes up, the smell, the money involved, and to avoid further dependency. But I don't know any actual methods that can help me to stop. I know **why** I want to stop, but just not **how**.

Help?

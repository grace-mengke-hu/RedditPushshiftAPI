Quitting and depression

Has anyone else experienced depression or even the feeling of emptiness when they first quit smoking? I'ts been a week now, no smokes, some cravings but a boat load of emotions. I've never been diagnosed with depression before so this feeling may be temporary but I feel god awful. I try to do so much to keep myself occupied but when I get a moment to think, I feel so lost, so alone and I cry.. a lot. 

Is this really withdrawal or should I see someone?

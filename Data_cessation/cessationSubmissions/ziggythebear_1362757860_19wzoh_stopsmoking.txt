I've had enough!

Been smoking a pack a day about seven years. Last year was a really successful for me as far as quitting goes. I also had a great support system, my ex. Starting smoking again the day she left me, six months ago. It's been hard to even think of quitting now that I'm around all my friends who smoke as well and back living in a place where I can freely smoke. But I'm tired of making excuses, I'm tired of chipping away at my savings $8 a day, I'm tired if smelling like shit, Im tired of lying to myself, I'm tired of feeling like an addict. I've had enough. 

Not buying a pack today. Good luck everyone else. We can do this.

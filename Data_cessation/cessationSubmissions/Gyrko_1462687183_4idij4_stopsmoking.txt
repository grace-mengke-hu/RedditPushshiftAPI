Three weeks and still rolling

Just past three weeks mark. These days I bearly think about cigs. It was not easy, I used to have a lot of carvings, was nervous, my mind tried to persuade me to smoke again, I had depression, some of my surroundings try to get me back to smoke. But there I am. No more think about cigs as best friends, no more think about it as my only help. Carrs book really help.  I don't smoke just for this day, drink a lot of water, eat well, starts jogging, use mantras, reread some passages of Carrs book. 
Wish everyone luck, if you are just in the beginning of your journey, just keep going it will go better soon. Breath deep and not one more puff no matter what.

So I went to /r/cigarettes yesterday and it broke my heart.

Saw posts with things like "turning 18 tomorrow, so excited to buy my first pack!", and "what's a good brand to get started with?".
I remember being that young when I made the decision that has affected so much of my life for the last 20 years.  I thought I knew everything, but had no clue what I was getting into.
Anyway, I'm having some cravings this weekend, and my asshole brain keeps saying "go ahead and have one" but you all on sub have kept me on the path. Instead of rewarding my one week with a pack of smokes, I bought myself a bunch of video games. I'm at home killing this Saturday night :)

I've actually LOST weight

On top of the roughly $1100 I've saved (well, spent on my enjoyable things?) I've actually lost 17 pounds since May 1st. I wasn't expecting that at all! In fact, I was bracing for the opposite. Maybe some more learned folks here can tell me why but all I can chalk it up to is I seem to have more energy and that causes me to move more? I also don't seem to have as many late night cravings for sweets as I used to. I dunno for sure, but I'll take it. Cheers :)

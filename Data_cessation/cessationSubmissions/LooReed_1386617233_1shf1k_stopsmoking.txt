Scared. Nervous. Questions inside

Hi All,

I respect everyone who participates in this subreddit - quitting the hardest addiction known to man is not easy.  I am going to embark on a difficult journey soon, and I want to make sure I do it right, so I have a few questions.

1. Allan Carr's book -- is there a free online PDF of this?
2. Is there a running regiment or a regiment for me to follow so that I don't put on weight?  This is what scares me the most.  I don't want to get fat.  I am a good looking 24 year old and it frightens me that my looks might fade away.  This is what constantly steers me away from quitting cigs and I **need** to find a way around it
3.  Because New Years is coming up, do I not quit now?  I have a feeling I won't be able to go out on New Years and it will have a serious effect on staying off cigs
4.  Is there a certain Go-to app to monitor my progress?  


Thank you so much, I really appreciate whoever took their time to read this.  I am so frightened and want to make sure I don't have to deal with having to quit in 10 years.

Dreams

I quit three days ago and since then, I've been having extremely weird en vivid dreams every night. Dreams in which everything feels so real, that it's hard to realise it wasn't, when I wake up in the morning. They have nothing to do with smoking, but other things are very realistic. Things like having wounds on my hands (that sometimes seem to still hurt when I wake up, even though there's nothing there), break-ins in my house, taking a shower (waking up with the feeling of wet hair), losing my phone, anything. And when I wake up, it takes me a while to realise that what I'm feeling isn't real.  
Anyone with experience of it? How long does it last? It tires me out.

What are you going to do with the money? (or what did you do with the money?)

Every day I put £4.37 in a jar. Money I would have smoked. I'm going to need a bigger jar soon. In approximately 32 weeks, (here's hoping things go to plan) there will be over £1000 in the jar. In my plan on my phone app I'm suppose to have a goal for that money, to keep me motivated. I've changed that goal 3 times in 9 days. But really all I want is to feel good and to feel free. What did you do with the money? What would you do with the money? (US$1704 as of today)

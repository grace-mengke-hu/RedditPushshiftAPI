Unfortunate events all happened at once, and the urge is back and stronger than ever.

Dear StopSmoking community,
First of all thank you, because you guys are amazing, and this sub has helped me a lot. two month ago I started working out and kick boxing and now I am in one of the best shapes of my life and I did not feel any urge to smoke up untill today. Today I had a fight with my father and told him to fuck off and left the house, later my uncle who is the most important person to me in the world called and he was on side of my scumbag abusive father because guess what, father is always right bullshit. He also told me he is cutting contact with me. I trained myself to be stoic and I holded perfect frame during both conversations without getting emotional but inside I am dying right now. I am overfilled with rage, if there was a punchingbag in my office I would rape it (figuratively). I feel strongest urge ever to just smoke. How should I handle this, because I feel like one more straw and my mental barrier will break.

DAMMIT

Stopped smoking in January. Fell off the wagon today. Lots of excuses -- stress at work, injured and can't exercise the way I want to, boredom, blah blah blah. I had that cigarette and it felt amazing. I finished it, and immediately felt like an idiot. I wanted to punch myself in the face for being so stupid. I was sure that I was doomed -- that I was going to start up again and never be able to quit for good.

Then, I thought about how amazing it felt not to smoke. I physically felt like a god after just a few days without smoking. For the first time in 18 years, my body was working the way it was supposed to. I don't want to give that up. I don't want to get winded carrying the laundry upstairs ever again. I don't want to stumble around first thing in the morning trying to find my smokes so I have something to do while I drink my coffee. I don't want to be constantly cramming gum in my mouth whenever I'm about to talk to people so my nasty-ass breath doesn't gross them out.

So I'm giving myself a break. I'm not going to feel guilty or stupid. I'm going to take the rest of this dumb pack of cigarettes and run them under the kitchen faucet, then chuck their soggy remains in the trash. Then, I'm going to come onto the subreddit EVERY SINGLE DAY, because even though I don't know any of you, it helps me to know that you guys are going through the same crap I'm going through.

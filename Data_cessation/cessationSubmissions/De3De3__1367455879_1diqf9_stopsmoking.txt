Do you think it is possible or should I wait

2 years ago my back began to hurt, and it got worse until sitting wasn't even possible anymore. So I lay flat all day, for almost 2 years now. I barely come out of the house with the immense pain I have when sitting up/ walking. I am on a lot of pain meds that helps a bit but not that much. I started smoking 3 months after I was bound to bed. I was stressed, scared and very bored. For me smoking is a distraction, I move myself to the balcony and have my cigarette. It is for me the main activity of my days and it makes me feel more calm. But I want to quit. I don't have the money really and with the meds I am taking my asthma got worse. I tried to quit twice but after a while I just gave in. For me it is a reward, taking smoking away feels like I make my life even worse than it already is. I bought patches and that helps a bit, but i get so immensely bored that all I think about is rewarding myself with a cigarette to feel better. In 1 week I will get small surgery and I want to quit before that.
So I wondered if some of you guys have any tips, I got the patches ready and my cigarettes are almost gone, but I am scared that I will fail again. (sorry for my English, it's not my first language)

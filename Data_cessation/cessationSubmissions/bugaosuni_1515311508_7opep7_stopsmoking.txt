I imagine there are some people here who are 'about' a week into their quit:

which means they are *about* two weeks away from losing the physical addiction.  The good news is that by now they have realized that the physical cravings are rather weak;  they are *persistent* to be sure, but they generally go away *whether you smoke or not*.

The other thing I'd like to say is that the mental habit was the real challenge for me.  So in my case every time the thought of smoking came up I replaced it with a thought of a stinking ashtray.... or stinking *like* an ashtray ..... or forcing myself to smoke when I really didn't want to, and how I would squinch my face up when I did it ... or the coughing that IS the inevitable result of smoking.  On and on.

So my point is, the physical part isn't that tough.  And the mental part just needs a strategy.  Desire is by far the most important thing though.  Good luck to all you quitters.  I hope this helps anyone.

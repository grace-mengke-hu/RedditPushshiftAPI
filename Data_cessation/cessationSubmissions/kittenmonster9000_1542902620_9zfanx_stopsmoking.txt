Waking up feeling great about myself on day 14 after putting myself in a position of temptation.

I work in retail and had a horrible day yesterday and decided to hang with some friends and have a few drinks to blow off steam. They wanted to go to the casino (where you can smoke indoors) and I honestly wasnâ€™t thinking about cigarettes at all when I agreed. So we arrive, I have a few drinks, and all my friends start smoking. Then again. Then again in the car on the way home. I kept repeating to myself the not one puff, not ever mantra and it really helped! And I woke up feeling so proud and on top of the world. Not giving into temptation is hard, but the reward is huge!

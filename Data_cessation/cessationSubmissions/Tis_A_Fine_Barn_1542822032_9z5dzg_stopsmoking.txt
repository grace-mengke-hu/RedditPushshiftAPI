I took a 3 hour drive today starting at 4 AM with Tim. At our destination, Tim gets out and lights one up, then offers me one (my brand). The words out of my mouth were a polite "no thanks" but in my head it was more along the lines of "FUUUUUUUCK." Hard one. Presenting #021 Spearow. See you Friday.

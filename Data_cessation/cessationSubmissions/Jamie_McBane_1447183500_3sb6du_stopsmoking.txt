The patch is bad?

I don't know...I'm on my 3rd week smoke free.  I get my nicotine replacement patches free from my nurse practitioner here in capreol Ont. I'm not getting any bad sensations or any cravings for the most part. I'm afraid that the patch is not an affective way to quit because of what I've read here on some of the posts..any ideas?

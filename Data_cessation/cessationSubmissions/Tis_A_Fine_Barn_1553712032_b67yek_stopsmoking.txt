Had two friends over last night to watch a movie. All three of us used to smoke. All three of us quit. We reveled in that a bit. We have to develop a completely different leaving-from-hanging-out ritual. We no longer go outside and smoke then say goodbye. Presenting #102 Exeggcute. See you tomorrow.

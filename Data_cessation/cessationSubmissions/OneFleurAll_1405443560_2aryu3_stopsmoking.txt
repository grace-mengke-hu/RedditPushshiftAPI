Newly quit, and I keep forgetting!

So, I had my last cigarette on Saturday. This is my second time quitting; before this, I actually quit for two years with the help of Chantix. I know, I know, *two years* and I went back? I was mad at me, too!

Anyway, it's been about a year as a pack-a-day smoker again and I finally decided enough was enough. I decided to go cold turkey because I really don't have the money to do otherwise, just like I don't have the money to keep smoking. And it's surprisingly okay so far! I'm spending a lot of time sleeping or trying to keep busy.

I do find myself reaching to light a cig before remembering: oh, right. But I keep telling myself that it's going to pass. Having the experience of being quit for 2 years, I know that my brain's going to eventually break the association between smoking and other stuff. I know I'll get to the point where holding a cigarette feels weird in my hand. But man, I wish I could speed it up. :)

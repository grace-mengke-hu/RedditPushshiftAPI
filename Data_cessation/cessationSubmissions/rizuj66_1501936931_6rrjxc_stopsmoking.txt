I'm going to lose all my friends

Have to go back to work in a week after a long summer break. For the past 5 years since starting there, I used to hang with a wonderful group of folks; the smokers' group. I work in a big, really unsociable university where literally the only group that socialises between departments, looks out for each other,  and really enjoys each other's company is this smokers group, out in our little courtyard. We are quite well-known for it.  There is no other common area for faculty to gather at our university - they didnt think of the faculty at all when the campus was designed. Also, going out for a smoke was my way to get outside and take a think break from work. And outside of work, the only people i want to be friends with are from this group.  Im pretty introverted so I'm not into making/having lots of friends. Now what do I do???

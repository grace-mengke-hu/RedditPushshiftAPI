Noticed my teeth are much whiter!

While I'm still in the beginning phase of quitting I am noticing some pretty awesome improvements. My teeth are getting much whiter without smoke staining them an awful shade of yellowish-brown. My breathing is getting much better so much so that ive started to run! Mainly walking long distances but I was actually able to run a mile without dying a quarter of the way through. 10 years I lived like a slave to big tobacco makes me wonder how many other things I avoided simply because smoking made it that much more difficult. Anyway just wanted to share that physically and psychologically its so worth it.

Starting week 3. I am annoyed with everything and everyone. Is this normal?

I've be smoking for about 15 years. Stopped last summer for about 2 months, and stopped again almost 14 days ago. I am very annoyed with little things. Initially I was thinking the first 3 days were hard. I don't feel like smoking, but everything seems to annoy the fuck out of me. I feel like I'm agitated easily and need to be alone. Is this normal ??

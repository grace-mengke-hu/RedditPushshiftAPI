Anyone find it harder the second time round?

I quit for 2-3 months last year and for whatever reason it was so easy. I was at Uni, smoked wayyy too much during freshers week (first week of uni where everyone parties), was coughing badly so I quit at the drop of a hat for 2-3months. Out with friends, flat out refused one many times, no cravings and slipped up with literally half a cigarette during the whole time. 

I fell off in late November, dropped out of uni and now I'm finding it so difficult. I think it's because I'm living at home where my Mum smokes roll ups so the temptation is always there. During the day at work I'm absolutely fine but at home bored I really struggle to break the habit.

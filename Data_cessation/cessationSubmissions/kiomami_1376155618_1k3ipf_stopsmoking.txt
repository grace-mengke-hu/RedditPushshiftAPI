Having trouble staying strong during a breakup

I had a good month of quit time before my bf of 3 years and I decided to take a break. I bought a pack, smoked two and gave them away. The next day I bought a second pack and I've had a few...but I decided I'm not going to start again after all my hard work. I'm wearing a patch and I'm staying quit! It's so hard not to pick up old comforting habits under stress. I'm posting to remind myself I'm a non-smoker, and of course fishing for support and advice. Thank you.

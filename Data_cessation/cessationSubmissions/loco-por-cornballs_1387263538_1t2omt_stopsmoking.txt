Quit over two years ago but have picked it back up recently.

So, I quit smoking (cold turkey) while I was studying for the bar exam over 2.5 years ago. I picked it back up here and there on occasion, but never anything crazy. However, I picked it back up about two months ago on and off, though the last month I've been smoking nearly every day. Nothing crazy if it was throughout the day, except that it was just when I drank. Maybe 4-6 in a night. I just recently, though, started having cravings without any alcohol. I've avoided the sauce today and am going to the next couple of days, so I have that down. 

Question, though, for those of you who have successfully quit for a long time but slip up, do you find that the cravings pass faster? Additionally, anything help with the cravings? It's honestly been so long since I quit, I don't remember what the hell I did to help.

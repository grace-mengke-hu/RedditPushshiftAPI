19 year old, I'm begging myself to quit

Hey there, so I'm a 19 year old dude who's trying to be an athlete (bodybuilder/cardio centric all around), and I've been fooling myself into saying that "this is the last one", I've been dabbling with smoking since I was about a sophomore in high school, and quitting back then was no hassle whatsoever, but now it feels like it's damn near impossible to quit. I buy a pack under high stress and then end up giving it away just to get it away from me, because like I said I wanna be an athlete and eventually a fighter and that's not gonna happen if I'm out of breath from my 3 mile walk to and from the gym that I've been doing for 3 years now, I need help, like I genuinely don't know what to do to quit even though I know the answer if fucking obvious, just stop smoking, but I feel trapped by these stupid fucking cancer sticks man.

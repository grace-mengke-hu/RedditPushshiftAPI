Holiday smoking two years after quitting

I wanted to share a small accomplishment with you guys. I haven’t smoked for just over two years now and in the beginning I used this sub a lot. This last weekend I visited my sister in Berlin. She was smoking again and said something about how it’s the thing to do here. I got offered cigarettes many times and got a bit of a snub for being a square, but resetting my progress is just not worth it to impress my big sister. I kept thinking it’s just one smoke, why fuss? But then why shouldn’t one be zero. Anyways, little victory that would’ve been lost two years ago.

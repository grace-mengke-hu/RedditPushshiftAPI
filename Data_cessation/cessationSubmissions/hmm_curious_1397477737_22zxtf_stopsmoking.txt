Why the social pressure on us quitters?

So i was out drinking in the weekend with a friend that quit on new-years. He borrowed a smoke from another friend that still smokes and a few people at the table were like "dude, WTF are you doing, don't do that to yourself". Meanwhile, other smokers at the table were still smoking 3-4 cigarettes per hour like usual and nobody would give them shit for doing it. 



Heck, about an hour later, the fact that my friend (the other quitter) had smoked gave me one hell of a craving. I even tried to light one up myself, even though I did not have a smoke since November, but my friends decided to rip it from my hands and kept the pack away from me. 



With their help I'm still smoke free...But I'm not sure that I like it this way. I had been having cravings for a week (rain mood and a lot of stress, plus another coworker that had quit for close to an year had relapsed and seeing her smoke gave me an urge). I'd also noticed this at work, people seeing her relapse were acting shocked and giving her shit about it....


Now If I start smoking again I'd face a lot of disappointment from my friends, my gf and my relatives and they/ some of them would look down on me and lecture me. If I had not quit at all, they would not mind me smoking. Besides the ongoing struggle to not smoke and the slight depression this hunger brings, you have to think of the shit you'd get if you started again.

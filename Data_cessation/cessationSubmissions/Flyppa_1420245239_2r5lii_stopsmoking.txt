Day 1 - Here goes nothing

Hey everyone, I've been smoking since i was 16 and I'm now 19 turning 20 this year. I have had enough of smoking, I'm sick of barely being able to hold my breath underwater when i go swimming, sick of my lack of breath hindering my workout abilities, sick of my food tasting dull and boring and most of all sick of smelling like an ash tray!

It's time for change, It will be a long road but I'm going to put my all into it and hope for the best. As of now I am a non-smoker and I hope to keep it that way!

I plan on keeping myself occupied by playing video games, watching movies and TV shows and the like. Does anyone have any helpful tips or advice for the journey ahead of me? Would be greatly appreciated.

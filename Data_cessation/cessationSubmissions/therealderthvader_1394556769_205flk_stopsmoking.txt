3.5 Weeks and a big personal victory!

Last night I put on a coat I haven't worn for a long time, and when I put my hand in the pocket, I found half a pack of my favorite cigarettes. Once I saw what I was holding, my first instinct was to toss it in the nearby garbage can - no hesitating whatsoever!

I would like wish everyone a lovely, cigarette-free day/week/month/year/life!

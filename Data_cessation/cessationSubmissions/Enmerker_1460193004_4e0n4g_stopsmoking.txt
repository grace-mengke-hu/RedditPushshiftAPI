Alcohol as a trigger

I've come all this way to day 10 and I'm proud of that. I've learned a lot about myself, for good or worse. I've figured out that coffee isn't a trigger for me, so I still drink it plenty, but I've feared alcohol since day one, fearing relapse. 

Today I had a rough day, nothing going my way, people complaining, computers crashing and having HUGE work related problems(work with VFX). I've been offered cigarettes from those I used to smoke with before during breaks and declined multiple times today. On my way home however, I said "fuck it", I'll buy some beer. I'm now getting very tipsy, much more than normal as I've been working out and dieting since quitting, but I'm surprised to say I'm actually not craving, that much....I have that lingering feeling that just one wouldn't hurt, but I know deep down it would. I'm drinking alone though, and lacking the social aspect of drinking to trigger me, but I was sure alcohol would be the death of my quitting. I'm raving on, but I'm glad that after 6 years of chain smoking while drinking that tomorrow will be day 11 and not day one! 

PS: sorry if the grammar is shit. As mentioned, I'm not sober, but I'm happy and staying focused:D!

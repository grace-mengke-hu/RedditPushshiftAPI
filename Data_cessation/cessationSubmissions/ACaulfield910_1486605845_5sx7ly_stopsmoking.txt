Just finished my last pack after a relapse

I didn't read Allen Carr's book or anything, but I read that his method consists of enjoying your cigarettes and setting a deadline, and that's what I did. 
 
After a brief one-week relapse, I set my deadline for the last cigarette in the pack. I didn't notice it when I was smoking the first time, but I noticed the effects of it now. My veins don't pop out as much, my gym pump's aren't as good, my face is *grayer*, and of course given than I live in NYC, those shits are expensive. And I just finished it. Let's do this!

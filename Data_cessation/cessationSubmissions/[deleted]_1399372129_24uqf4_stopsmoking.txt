Nine days without smoking a cancer stick.

Been smoking for three years with four failed attempts at quitting. This one will be my fifth, and hopefully my last failed attempt. So far like the title says I have eight days without lighting one up. I thought that I would struggle at first, but for some reason it was pretty easy. I rarely had a urge to smoke a cig. I thought to myself well I guess it's smooth sailing for me on this fifth attempt. I celebrated too soon. Yesterday I felt a sudden urge to smoke a cigarette, but I resisted. I tried to get my mind off it by playing some video games. It didn't work. All day yesterday I couldn't keep my mind off it. I thought after the first three days that if you resisted the urge to smoke that you were set... Has this happened to anyone else?


Edit: Eight days not nine. I don't know why I wrote nine instead of eight.


Edit2: Was too weak to stay smoke free...

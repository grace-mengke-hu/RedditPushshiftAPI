Not sure if I miss the smoking or the ritual?

So - back to quitting smoking again.  Quit on Sunday (3 days ago) and not sure if I miss the smoking or the ritual?  Anyone else feel that way?  Ritual for me included stopping at the local forest preserve before and after work to smoke...so maybe I will do the same but read and drink coffee instead...

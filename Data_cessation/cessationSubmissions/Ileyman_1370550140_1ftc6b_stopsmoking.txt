1:30 PM Cravings

At about 1:30 PM every day at work I get the biggest craving for a cigarette. It lasts until I get home from work and then it's gone. This has happened every day this week (I was on vacation last week). I feel like it's a mix of good and bad. Good I am at work and can't really go anywhere, bad that I have trouble focusing on my work. Anyone experience anything similar?

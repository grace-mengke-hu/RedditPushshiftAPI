How can I get rid of the smell of smoke in my car?

My 2 biggest triggers are the smell of cigarettes and driving.  I'm trying to quit smoking and driving as a short term goal, but everytime I get in the drivers seat I get the unbearable urge to light up.  So my question to you guys is how do I get the smell of stale smoke out of my vehicle?  Thanks guys!

8 months smoke free

Just earned my 8 month badge!  Time may travel quickly, but December 26th seems very far away.  Eight month shows the clarity of just what nicotine takes from you, it literally controls your life.  I am so glad to be free.  It was tough.  But it can and should be done.  My one regret will always be waiting so long and not doing it sooner than a 31 years later.  But it did get done and I am so grateful!  I never regret being a non smoker.  It feels amazing!

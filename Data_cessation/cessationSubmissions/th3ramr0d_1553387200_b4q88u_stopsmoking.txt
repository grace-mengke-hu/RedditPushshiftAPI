First time in years that I’ve quit smoking for more than a few days.

Today marks 10 days without. I’m past the withdrawals and right now I’m just battling the urge to smoke out of habit and association. I don’t really have any tips or tricks I’m following. If you got some they’d be nice to hear. Just straight up will power. Hoping to keep it up.

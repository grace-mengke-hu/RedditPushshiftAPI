Is a slow stop more effective than cold turkey?

I told myself and some coworkers that I was going to quit Jan. 1st, how original!  On the 3rd I smoked one by accident, it was just sort of impulsive with getting home from work and didn't even realize it until like halfway through, since then Ive only really smoked every other day or something, so only 4 this year, is this slow grinding to a halt going to help or should just man up and stop altogether.

P.S.- Either way this sucks, I like smoking, it makes me happy and taste good and I enjoy the act.

Been smoking for almost 3 years, and I need a little advice.

I've been a smoker since I was 18, and I'll be 21 in March. My parents caught me a year ago, and they think I've quit. I've just gotten better at hiding it.

Part of me really does want to quit. I'm a singer, and after three years of smoking about 3 cigs a day (thats a rough average) I'm starting to notice the health effects. Dry throat, tons of phlegm, eye irritation, etc. On top of that, I'm finally realizing how bad I smell. I used to be able to cover it up, but not anymore for some reason.

The problem is have is two-fold: 1) Despite many good reasons to quit (disapproval from parents, wasting a college student budget, health effects, smell, damaging my voice even though I'm a vocal performance major, etc) I can't drag myself away from them. I really don't think I smoke all that much. Its small, but consistent. But I'm certainly addicted, and I'm not sure what I need to get around it.

And 2) Almost all of my friends smoke. We hang out at the local hookah lounge all the time. I am around smoke constantly. I can't just stop hanging out with my best friends simply because they're smokers, but I know that it will be almost impossible to try and quit when I do decide to if I'm around smoke all the time.

What do you recommend, people of /r/stopsmoking? Any and all advice is greatly appreciated.

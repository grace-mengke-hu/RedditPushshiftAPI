Need help fighting the "one's ok" today

I had my last cigarette yesterday at 2:30 PM CDT. I had a therapy appointment yesterday evening and I knew I was *so* close, and she helped me get over the hump... I wanted to stop for me. I WANT to stop for me. Who I am as a person, my values, beliefs, and morals, they don't align with being a smoker, especially a closeted one. I'm doing fine today with iritability, physical cravings are low. I have lozenges for when they hit bad, haven't needed one yet. 

But that God damn voice in the back of my head keeps saying "one is fine, you'll have one today and that's nothing in the grand scheme of things!" 

HELP ME SHUT IT UP PLEASE. I respond exceptionally well to logical arguments. I can't logically argue with the voice right now. Little help.

Secret Smoker Needs Support Network

Smoked for 10 years, quit for about 8 years, been smoking again now for about 2 months.  I've kept my relapse a secret from friends, family, coworkers... ect.  My quit day is this Saturday, I've already got the patches (how I quit the first time).  What I need is a support network to keep me honest. Help me /r/stopsmoking.

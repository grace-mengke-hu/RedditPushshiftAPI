Has anyone here tried an Easyway seminar? How did it work out?

I tried to quit with Alan Carr's book about a year and a half ago, and had some success with it... for a handful of weeks. Then my life came crashing down around my ears. I lost my job, had to find a new place to live, close friend died unexpectedly, on and on... it was a few months of heart-break and terror and stress and ultimately I ended up smoking again.

I've been meaning to try the book again, but for whatever reason can't bring myself to actually start reading it. In all honesty, I am more than a little afraid to give up this bad habit I've had for about 20 years now. I know it's killing me. I know for a fact i've got pre-hypertension (120/80) because of it, crazy mucus issues in the morning, I am beginning to develop a smoker's cough, etc... but it's been a habit my entire adult life. If I am being honest with myself, I don't know how to live without it.

So I was thinking that perhaps one of the Easyway seminars would be the way to go. There's one being held in my city the weekend after next. What say you? Has anyone here gone to an easyway seminar or clinic? Is it worth the money?

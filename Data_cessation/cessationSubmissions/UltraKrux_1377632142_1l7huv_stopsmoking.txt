Another attempt. Trying to understand my failures.

Hey guys ignore the badge I havent reset it yet. This is another first day for me and j really want to know why ny brain gets to the point where I don't care anymore.   I start off so motivated and willing to quit and by the end of the day I'm trying to convince myself and hash plans to get my next smoke. I wish the motivation would stay with me. Will this change after the cravings go? I feel like flip flopping between super motivated and nothing will never allow me to truly quit.

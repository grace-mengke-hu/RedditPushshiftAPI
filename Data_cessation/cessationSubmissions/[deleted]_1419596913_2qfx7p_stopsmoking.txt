God bless you, Allen Carr

Allen Carr, I never knew you. I wish you were still alive so I could write to you and thank you. I had tried so many times to quit. I tried cold turkey, I tried with a nico-inhaler, I tried with different brands of electronic cigs, I tried smoking only when drinking, I tried only one a day, I tried only tobacco with spliffs, I tried only smoking with friends. I tried everything. Then I read your book, Allen. I was skeptical before reading but the truth was so real. It affected me in a way that no other book has. I was rushing to finish because I was excited to quit. I haven't looked back since. I feel great. I don't find it difficult at all. I smoked for seven years. Now I am saving my money and my health, and feel more confident and happy. Thank you, Allen. I'm not a believer, but I feel no other statement can express my true appreciation for you. God bless you, Allen Carr.

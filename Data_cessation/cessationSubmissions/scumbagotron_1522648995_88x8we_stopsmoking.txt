I'm here now!

Several false starts. Had the flu a couple of weeks ago and my cough was just ridiculous. Figured it's about time I actually stopped.

I'm a year sober from alcohol, maybe there are parallels? I guess I'll find out.

Anyway I've requested my badge and this is me saying, yeah, you know what, this is dumb and I'm done.

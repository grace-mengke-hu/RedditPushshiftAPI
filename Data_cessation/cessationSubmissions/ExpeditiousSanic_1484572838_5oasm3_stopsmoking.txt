19 y/o, 3 year smoker: Advice on quitting

Hi everyone, so I've been smoking for just over 3 years and thought that getting out sooner rather than later would be better for my health. I ordered 8 weeks of free patches from a stop smoking group, and am wondering if anyone here has advice that they could give me. I have quit 2 times over the past 3 years, and each time I willingly got back into it. This time will be different.

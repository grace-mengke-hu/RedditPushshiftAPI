I have one cigarette left in my pack...

ONE. I was going to quit tomorrow anyway, but now that I'm physically looking at "the last cigarette" I'm freaking out. 

I think I'm going to buy some patches... and maybe an e-cigarette too. 

I know that "cold turkey" is /r/stopsmoking 's preferred method, but I'm... so scared. 

If I need a crutch to help me through the fear of not buying another pack... SO BE IT. 

Ok. Here we go, guys.

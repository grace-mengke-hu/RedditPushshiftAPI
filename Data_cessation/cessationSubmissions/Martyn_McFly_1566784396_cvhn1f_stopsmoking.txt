My first post in here...A few questions

So I quit drinking 25 days ago and cigarettes are the last thing in my life I hate that I’m addicted to. I’ve listened to Allan Carr’s book twice. But I don’t really know how to start quitting For Real. 

What’s helped you the most in quitting. What are somethings you notice early, later, and way later mentally and physically when you quit?

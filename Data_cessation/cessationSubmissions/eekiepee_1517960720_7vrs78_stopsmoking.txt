My 3 keys to becoming a former smoker

1. Recognize I am an addict who is in recovery: this is not a game, it’s what kind of life I’m going to lead. 

2. Define myself as a former cigarette smoker. Make the decision. Once you decide you will never smoke another cigarette, it gets a lot easier to resist. You’ve already made the decision. There’s not much to think about. But you cannot be of two minds about this. You have to decide. 

3. De-couple the triggers from the response. Recognize your nervousness, little anxieties, and all the things big and small that have become triggers for you. And realize that those things aren’t going away. But there is simply zero reason that any of them ever should or would result in you lighting up again. 

That’s it.

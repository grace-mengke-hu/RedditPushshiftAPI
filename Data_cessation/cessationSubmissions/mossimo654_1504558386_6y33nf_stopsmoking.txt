Does anyone crave nicotine when on stimulants like adderall?

I was a very occasional social smoker until I started taking adderall daily as an adult for ADHD. Since then I've never been a super heavy smoker, but it can get as bad as 2-3 a day. I notice on days that I don't take it that I have absolutely no desire for a cigarette, and in fact they gross me out.

Last school year was extremely stressful and I ended up smoking more than usual. However, over summer I took a two month drug vacation and didn't touch or crave a cig once. I thought that maybe I'd kicked the habit and would be able to take adderall again and be fine.

Well, I just started taking it again this weekend and I've been really disappointed to discover that my cravings are as strong as ever.

Has anyone else experienced this or have any advice? I really don't want to smoke, and it sucks knowing that taking something that is really helpful for me causes me to crave something that's really harmful.

As a side note: I'd be interested if anyone has any info as to *why* chemically or psychologically I have this association. I've tried to do some cursory internet research but pretty much found only sketchy drug forums whose info I don't exactly trust. 

Edit: never mind I [found a study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/18566803/). It would seem that stimulants and nicotine "acutely cross potentiate" the effects of each and "enhance acutely nicotine's desirability in humans"... bummer :/

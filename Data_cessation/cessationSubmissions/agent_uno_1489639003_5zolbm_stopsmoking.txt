Seeking advice: Can cutting down drastically while using a #2 patch work?

For me it's come down to money. Been smoking for 20 years. American spirits I've heard have some of the highest nicotine of all. I know I can't just quit; I've tried. A year ago I started using a #2 patch and for 9 days cut my number from 15-20/day down to 5 or less, but then I went back up and figured the combo of the patch and cigs would be bad, so stopped patching.

I'm ready to try again, and seeking advice, experience, and thoughts?

I'll add that I've already listened to the audiobook that everyone suggests - "the easy way" one and it didn't help.

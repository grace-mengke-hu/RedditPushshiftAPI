Stop smoking or start vaping

More and more I wonder if we are in a non-smoker forum here or some kind of startup platform for vaping.

Of course I know about NRT and that it works for some people. Also I think it’s necessary for smokers with other physical or mental problems.

But telling someone in his first post „hey... try vaping“ is more like advertising a new/different way to consume nicotine.

What do you think? Am I so much wrong in the way I feel about such posts?

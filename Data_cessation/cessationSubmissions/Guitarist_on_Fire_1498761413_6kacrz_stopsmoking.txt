I've made it over a week

Well, I'm not going to lie. It has been easier than I expected after the first few days were out of the way. Starting to feel a bit better and I can smell/taste things again. I can't help but feel like I really haven't "quit" because I'm still vaping and still addicted to nicotine. I do plan to step down in the near future, but I'm dreading the full cessation from nicotine. 

At the very least, I haven't inhaled a single puff of tobacco in over a week so that's good. Gotta keep that resolve going strong. I still notice myself romanticizing my memories of cigarettes. I have to abruptly stop these thoughts and pummel them with honesty. Those nice memories of smoking are false. More often than not my lungs have felt like garbage and I coughed like I was dying as I coated my lungs with carcinogenic tar. Those memories could have been even nicer without the addition of slow, willful suicide. 

Keep it up, everyone!

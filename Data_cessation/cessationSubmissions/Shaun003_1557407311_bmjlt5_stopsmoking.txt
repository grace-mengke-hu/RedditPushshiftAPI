Shivers and Sweats

Okay so Iâ€™m on 3 days now . 

I feel like crap at this very moment . I get occasional shivers and sometimes what feels like fevers . Are these normal withdrawal symptoms ? 

I can fight the hollow feeling in my stomach but I feel like passing out atm . My hands are sweating and the anxiety is setting in . Up until now my confidence has been enough to fight the urge to light one up . 

I hate myself for starting to smoke !

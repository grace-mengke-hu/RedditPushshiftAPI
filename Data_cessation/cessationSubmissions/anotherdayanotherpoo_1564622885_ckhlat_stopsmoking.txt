Smoking to vaping to quitting

I went from a pack a day for 6 years to a heavy juul user at the beginning of the year. A bit more than a week ago I put the juul down and stopped. The first three days were hell. Especially because I became so compliant with vaping while watching TV , Studying, or playing games. I believe that I've done the hard part. I crave nicotine throughout the day but they stop after a few minutes... I really didn't think I'd get there guys. I really thought it was inevitable that I would start smoking stoges again because I never really quit nicotine. BUT IM THERE NOW ! No nicotine in more than a week! I'm so happy and proud of myself. I have no one to tell because all my friends vape and looked confused as to why I was excited to quit something so "harmless". I love you all and believe in your journeys for self improvement.

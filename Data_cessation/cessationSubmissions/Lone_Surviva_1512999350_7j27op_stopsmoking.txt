My first month

Its been a month since I smoked my last cigarette, Its been a mixed journey to reach a month, fortunately I had less cravings than most quitters and everything came to normal now (not a single craving).
I substituted cigarettes with oranges and veggies(which is great)(Try to make your own juice :))
The visible change that I saw in my case:
Day by day after I quit, my gums and texture started to become normal and the color changed from bloodish red to pink(amazing).
Looking forward to notice a lot more changes.
Thank you guys for sharing your stories and inspiring even more people across the world to quit smoking.

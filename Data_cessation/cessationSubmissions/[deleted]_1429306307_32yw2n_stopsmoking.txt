Thank god for smokeless tobacco.

I quit smoking shortly after my 19th birthday and it's been such a weight off my shoulders. A can of Copenhagen or Skoal is probably half the price of Marlboro. I no longer wake up coughing to the point where I vomit, so that's another plus. Also TIL that cigarette smoke contains over 4,000 chemicals. Yeah, fuck that.

2 Months Smoke Free

Hello everyone!

I normally lurk but when I found this place I just had to make a post. I'm glad to announce that I'm 2 months smoke free and couldn't be prouder. I smoked for 4 years and decided this year I would stop lol. I'm not really religious but when my family asked me what I was sacrificing for Lent this year I decided to say cigarettes and I quit cold turkey. Anyways have a great day everyone! =]

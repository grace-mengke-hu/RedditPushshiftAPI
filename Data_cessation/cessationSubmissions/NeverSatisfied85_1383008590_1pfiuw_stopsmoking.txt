Oh ye. 2 weeks and a question.

So two weeks and craving are finally starting to... linger quietly. (if that makes sense).   However every morning my throat is dry and lots of well nastiness similiar the morning after a hard night of partying and smoking.   Is this just he body cleaning itself out? How much time am I looking at until I wake up and my throat feels normal?

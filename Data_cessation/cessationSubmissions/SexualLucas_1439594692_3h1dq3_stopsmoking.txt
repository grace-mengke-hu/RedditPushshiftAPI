I've had a fairly easy time quitting

Some of you will be upset but really, I've been fine. The cravings weren't that harsh in the beginning, and at this point just having some (nicotine free) gum or seeds to chew, or a video game to play keeps them at bay. I was a smoker for 6 years, a pack a day smoker for 4 years... I'm so excited to be done. Every other 'quit' I did involved patches, vaporizers, and gum. I never just cut off the nicotine like I did this time. I feel like this is it, like I'm not a smoker anymore, and the thought of inhaling smoke grosses me out. 

You can do it. The thing I keep telling myself is, what will I regret more? Hating life for a few minutes or continuing to poison myself with cigarettes.

Alcoholism recovery and cigarette relapse

It seems like for a lot of people on this sub, drinking is a major trigger, but for me *not drinking* has been the trigger :-/ I quit smoking on NYE for a month and a half and was feeling great about it, but then I finally crawled out of my denial cave about my alcoholism, quit on 2/14, went through a terrible breakup, then promptly relapsed with cigs hard. AA has been a major help for me in staying sober, but lots of the members smoke, which has been a major trigger for me. Anyone here have experience with this? I really want to know what it's like to wake up without any addictions at all.

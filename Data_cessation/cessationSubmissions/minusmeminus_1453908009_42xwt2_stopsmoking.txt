Smell of smoke since I quit... weird moment

So weird thing happened today. The smell of cigarette smoke never bothered me. I actually liked it. I work in IT so we had an outside consultant come in today to work on a device that we don't have much experience on. He was a heavy smoker you could tell. He sat next to and i smelt it and instead it smelling good it actually made me feel like i was gonna be sick. I started to get a headache as well. Then I started to think OMG did i smell like this for the past 15 years and people who smoked or did not smoke had to smell me all the time.. all i can say is gross and im so glad i quit.

3 weeks smoke-free

Wow, I never thought I'd make it past day 3.
I quit cold turkey 3 weeks ago after smoking 10 cigs a day for nearly two years. 
I no longer notice shortness of breath. The infamous "smoker's cough" has cleared up for the most part. 
The other day someone mentioned how great my skin looks! "it doesn't have that yellowish tint anymore."
I feel amazing. I know I'll have good and bad days, and the struggle is FAR from over, but I'm feeling really positive lately. 
We can do it.

Im worried about the before/after work time frame.

Every time I try to quit I get caught up in the early morning commute and on the way home. It's like I'm watching a show on TV where I cant control what happens, Im just seeing it. I dont want to smoke, I tell myself Im done. But the next thing I do is pull into the gas station. I stop at a gas station, buy a pack, and then tell myself I'll just have one because (insert whatever excuse). I plan on throwing the pack away and quitting but it just keeps happening. I want to be done with nicotine altogether. I dont want to be addicted. I am worried about the ride home tonight. I hope I dont crack.

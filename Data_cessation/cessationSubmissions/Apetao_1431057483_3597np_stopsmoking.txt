According to Allen Carr I'm the worst type of smoker

I don't smoke in my car since its relatively new and I stunk up the old one and vowed not to do that again.

I don't smoke at home because my wife is a nurse and I don't want to deal.

I don't smoke at work because no one else does.

I smoke 3 cigarettes a day. I stop at a park on my way to and back from work and I eat my lunch usually in my car and smoke in some parking lot away from my job. 

Early morning , post lunch and evening before I get home. I should be able to but th after lunch is what is keeping me hooked. Help.

Tips for replacing after-work cigarette habit?

My biggest setback is the habit of having a cigarette after work. I can go all day, and all night, it's just that one cigarette that signals the end of the day that throws me off.

I've tried replacing it with exercising, but I'll just have a cigarette right before or right after exercising. I've also tried replacing it with cleaning, cooking, going for a walk - nothing works!!!

When does the boredom stop?

Thanks for all your support guys. I've made it to Day 25 and there is no end in sight. I have a reward planned for myself on Day 31, next Wednesday, and that's what I focus on whenever I get a "nicotine" craving. (It's a dope massage; I've never gotten a pro massage before, just ones from... never mind)

But there are times when I just feel the need of... SOMETHING. I get bored easily, I guess. I've been chewing gum religiously for the past few weeks whenever I just need something. I get this anxious energy, I guess, that needs to be satisfied.

I've been able to do something with my hands, like guitar and video games, when I'm at home. If I'm out, it's always gum. Since it's starting to get nicer I've been out more. The problem is I'm having some acid reflux issues (since before I quit) that can be exacerbated by chewing gum. So now of course that I've figured that out I'm all nervous to chew gum.

What else can I do? I like nuts but only like cashews, which are so loaded in calories that I can't actually justify eating that much of them. And I'm not into raw vegetables. I know they're good for me but yuck.

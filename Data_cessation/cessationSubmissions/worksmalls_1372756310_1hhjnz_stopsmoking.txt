Two weeks down!

I have not had any nicotine of any method in 14 days.
My wife is also, today, 24 weeks pregnant.

I thought I'd be a smoker forever. I really thought that I'd never have the motivation to drop it. But now, I think about how in a few months I'll be able to hold my baby boy and not be self-conscious of my stink. And while he grows up, I won't be a negative influence, I'll be able to be a positive influence *against* smoking.

Today is a good day. 

If you don't think you can do it, **YOU CAN**. Stop thinking it's difficult, because it isn't. It really isn't. You'll be so glad you did.

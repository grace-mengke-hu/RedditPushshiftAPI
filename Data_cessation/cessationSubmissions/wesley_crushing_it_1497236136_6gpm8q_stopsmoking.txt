Being a non-smoker is sheer awesomeness

I know a lot of people hit rough spots 2-3 months in, so I wanted to write this as a reminder to my future self: being a non-smoker is AMAZING and I never want to give it up.

Things I don't miss about being a smoker:

- Waking up in the middle of the night with twinges in my chest and thinking "oh boy, this is it, I have cancer/heart failure/emphysema and it's my own damn fault" and then going down a guilt/anxiety spiral

- My hair reeking of cigarettes and always feeling greasy (just me? I swear my hair never felt clean when I was a smoker)

- Being unable to enjoy a movie, date, concert, art museum trip, etc etc because all I could think about was getting another fix

- Getting sick like every two weeks

- Constantly feeling like my heart was beating a mile a minute

- Feeling emotionally and physically numbed out

- OH and also years and years of doing elaborate gymnastics to hide my habit from my family because I was so deeply ashamed of smoking

Benefits I've seen in just a month of not smoking:

- I am 1000% less anxious and my heart beat feels normal 

- I'm rarely out of breath and my nose isn't constantly stuffy

- I feel so much more confident and optimistic

- Went on several dates with an insaaanely hot dude who I don't think would have been into me when I smoked. AND I could actually enjoy the dates without being distracted. 

- Running is a billion times more fun

- I can actually smell things and I almost think I can like...feel things better? Like my circulation is so improved that my whole experience of the world is better

- Got more energy so I can do more fun stuff and important stuff and boring stuff and cool stuff

- I'm starting to feel more creative than I was before, this weekend I busted out more art in one go than I have in years

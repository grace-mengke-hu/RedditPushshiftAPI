I finally quit. Somehow.

Something clicked almost two months ago when I ran out of breath for about fifteen minutes, freaked me out. The next day, it was as if all my desire to smoke had vanished. It reminded me of when I totaled a second car and immediately lost my desire to drink despite being an alcoholic. This feels great.

Nearly 24 hours without a cig

I had my last cigarette nearly 24 hours ago, and the cravings are so bad I've picked up my keys to go to the shop for a packs several times. Does anyone have any good advice on how to deal with cravings? I've been chewing gum like a demented cow but it's not helping very much!

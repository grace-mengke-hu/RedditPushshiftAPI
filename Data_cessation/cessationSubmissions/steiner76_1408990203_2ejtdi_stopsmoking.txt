Quitting again for the 100th time

I have quit before for weeks, and several days, but always go back when I feel stressed out. I'm reading Allan Carr's book and know this is just a fake symptom created by nicotine. I'm quitting today - my teeth deserve it, my body deserves it, and my wallet deserves it. I'm sick of this addiction. Here's to day one :)

I've gone 2 days... need help!

Hey guys, I'm a college student and have now gone 2 days without a smoke.  I spent all the rest of my cash on food so I CAN'T buy any cigs.  I have found it helpful to fill the "void" with exercise, but I often think about how easy it would be to have a smoke, and how I really would be happy if I could smoke again.  Deep down I NEVER want to smoke again, but it's these heat of the moment things that make it so hard... what tips do you guys have? Generally how long do cravings last? weeks? months?

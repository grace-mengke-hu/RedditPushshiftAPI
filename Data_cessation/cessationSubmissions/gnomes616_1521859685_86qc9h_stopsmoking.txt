This is the first time I've checked this sub not on mobile in a while...

And it says I am at 1337 days.

Which is pretty 1337.

Things I've done since quitting:

Ran a bunch of 5ks

Ran two 10ks

Started running regularly with my dog.

Lost 15 lbs (and then gained 10 back because...)

I got into grad school.

I've been able to go to clinical rotations and job interviews without worrying about how I smell or how my teeth look.

I took a picture with one of my classmates and my teeth actually looked white!

I've cut back sugar and salt, because I can actually taste flavors (working on losing that 10 lbs again).

Take care of yourselves, and each other, and your squishy insides!

Almost 48 hours cold turkey. I'm feeling close to lapsing! Help!

Gone from being a 20+ a day smoker until Sunday when I threw a whole pack away and quit for good. It's been crazy up and down since, but my pangs are slowly getting the better of me today. 

I can't think or concentrate, I just need a smoke. I know it is a mistake but I can feel myself reasoning that it's better to smoke than be miserable!

Lung recovery suggestions?

I haven't smoked in a little over a year, and I'm wondering what you all would recommend to help clear my lungs and boost their recovery? I'm already exercising regularly and on my way towards eating better, and I drink "lung tea" fairly regularly (about 8 or 9 times a week) which is just an herbal tea containing nettles, peppermint, spearmint, thyme, ginger, licorice, and marshmallow root, which all have respiratory system healing properties.

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks for your time!

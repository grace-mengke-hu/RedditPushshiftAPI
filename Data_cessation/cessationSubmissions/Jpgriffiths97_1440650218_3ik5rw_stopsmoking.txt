just became a pack a day smoker. I need help.

The title says it. I hit a pack a day today. Two cigarettes, one right after another just to keep going till the next break at work. I bought it this morning, I have one left. I've tried quitting before, used nicotine patches, gum, sleep, anything to no avail. I need you guys. I need to quit. I'm only eighteen, I've been smoking for 5 years. Any advice guys? I'm breaking the last one into tiny pieces now. It's time to quit for good. Tired of the smell, the taste, the yellow teeth and low lung capacity.

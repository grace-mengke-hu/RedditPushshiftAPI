When you're ready, you're ready

So it just dawned on me the other day. That as of February 8th 2015 I have been smoke free for a year. And I must say WOW. I smoked a pack pack and a half a day for 7 years...smoking consumed me like I'm sure you all have experienced... and one day I said to myself. March 8th I'm quitting I had had enough. I went to my local coffee shop and had a coffee and a smoke (figured I'd go out with a bang) and that was it. I never looked back.  I went to work the next day and guys were throwing their packs at me saying here have one I said nah. I had almost no urge to smoke and if I did I gave it 5 minutes and it was gone.. little tasks these days have been a dream I find myself not winded or sluggish. Unfortunately I gained 30 pounds because well  food taste like food again. But that's another demon.  

Anyone of you can do it! It's all in your head 100% believe me when I say that. It does get better it does get easier.

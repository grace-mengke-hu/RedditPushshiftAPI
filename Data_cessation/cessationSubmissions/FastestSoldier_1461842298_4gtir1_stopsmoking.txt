Dreaming about relapsing

I'm on the fifth day and I have started dreaming about tobacco more and more. This night I dreamed about relapsing. I took a few puffs from a cigarette in the dream and felt the high. Then, just after the nicotine monster had been fed, I had this really gross feeling. The feeling of failure, disrespect for your own person, not having self-control and being a slave to nicotine for the rest of your life. It's a horrible feeling and as a serial quitter that has relapsed many times, my dream recreated the feeling of relapsing perfectly. Thanks to my "nightmare" I got reminded of just how horrible relapsing is. This will definitely help me not relapsing in the future. 

To other quitters out there who are thinking about just taking one cigarette. You're thinking: "Just one won't do any damage". It will and you give the nicotine another chance of trapping you again. And I promise you. Just after a couple of puffs of a cigarette you will get the horrible feeling of relapse as I described above. I can guarantee it. Just hold on trough the cravings.

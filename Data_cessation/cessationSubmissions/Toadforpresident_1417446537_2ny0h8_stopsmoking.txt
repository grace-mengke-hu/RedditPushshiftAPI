About 5 months in, danger zone for me

Hi everyone,

Haven't posted here in awhile but have monitored the posts and comments every now and then since quitting a few months ago. I am just looking for some advice and probably a swift kick in the ass to keep me on track.

My badge number is still true, i haven't smoked a cigarette yet or fallen off the wagon. I've quit a number of times before though and this is usually the hardest part for me, when i get a few months in. I'm not really sure why as it seems most people are good to go after they've made it a few weeks; maybe it's because i have made it a long time before and fallen back into old habits, which makes it harder not to fall into that trap again. The longest I ever made it was a year before some personal issues gave me a convenient excuse to start up again.

I have to admit that I still do crave cigarettes; it's nowhere near as much as when I first quit, just sort of a dull ache. I know if I were to smoke one at this point it probably wouldn't taste very good, but I can't seem to get my brain to stop craving them. When I started this quit (and this goes for almost all of my quits) I was super determined to get over the hump and leave it behind once and for all. It seems like that motivation starts leaving me after a few months though and I start thinking about how nice it would be to have one again. I'm sure some of you know how that is, your brain starts telling you it will be like a reward for making it so long. Surely you won't pick it up again, you haven't had one for 5 months, what's the harm in having just one? Yada yada yada

So I'm trying something new and posting here before I fall off. I hope this doesn't come off as discouraging to anyone that is just now quitting, I think a lot of people really do turn a corner very early on so please hang in there and stay quit! 

Anyways, just wanted to post here and vent a little. Advice, words of motivation, etc...are all welcome. thanks for reading!

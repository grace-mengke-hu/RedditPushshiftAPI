Day 3 and completely irrational?

Day one, I had an insane amount of energy. Day two, I was really disoriented. Day three, completely fucking depressed. Spent literally all day binge watching Girls on HBO. Pretty sure I just dumped my boyfriend of almost a year for making an insensitive joke, which he does all the time. HOW DO I MAKE THIS MOOD GO AWAY? 

(Yes, this is not my first rodeo and I know I need to reset my badge. Iâ€™ll get on that.)

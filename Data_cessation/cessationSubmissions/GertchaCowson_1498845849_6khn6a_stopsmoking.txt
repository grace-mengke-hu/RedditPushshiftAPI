Beware the happiness smokes

Been a month and today should have been a good day. Work outstanding, kids passed a MAJOR milestone, some good news on an investment and also wife closed a significant deal. And all I could think about sitting in the car on the way home was how I could go buy cigarettes and smoke now, in celebration.

I didn't, but on a day I should be celebrating, it's been the toughest one yet. Just sharing to keep myself strong.

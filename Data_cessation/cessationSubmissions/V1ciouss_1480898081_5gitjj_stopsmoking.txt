Day 1 again

Smoked today after not smoking for 3 days. I went out and bought a pack of cigarettes telling myself that I would only have one and it would be my last one. I ended up smoking 6 of them in the last 5 hours. I just had my last one and decided to sign up here because I feel like I need an outlet sometimes when I get bored and start thinking about smoking. The physical cravings is never what gets me, I always relapse because I feel like I dont know what to do with my time when I am not smoking.

I want this to be the last time

I've stopped smoking a million times, but I can't stay stopped. I threw out the rest of my carton last night. I want this to be the last time I do that...I've thrown out
So many packs in an effort to quit. 
Im 3 months sober in AA and I picked up smoking In sobriety, about a month ago, and I'm afraid it's going to lead me to drink and drug again. I don't wanna go back. I live in New York. I want to call the nyquits hotline but that makes me feel like a pussy. 
I'm a 23 year old man

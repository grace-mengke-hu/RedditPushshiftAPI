Have any of you tried Kwit?

I recently downloaded it and it has been the biggest helper that I have had so far. All the patches and chantex and e-cigs have never worked because my relapse is always mental. Kwit is like many other quit smoking apps but this one has the twist of truing it into a game like epic win does for to-do lists.

Any time the temptation comes to smoke i just open the app really quick and look at all the progress I would lose and that helps in a big way so thought I would suggest it to you all.

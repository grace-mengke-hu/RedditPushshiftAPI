First day, quitting cigs and weed

Dear /r/stopsmoking,

I've been on and off smoking cigs for a couple years now (not the most serious among you I know) and have been smoking weed regularly since the age of 15 (Just turned 22 today). Feeling a bit like a grownup and preparing to graduate from uni has made me realize that it's time to grow up and get rid of the habits that I picked up back when I felt like I was invincible and had a million years to live. Going completely cold turkey as I haven't been a huge smoker (probably 2-4 cigs per week, some weeks an entire pack) and hoping that a community will help me make good steps in my life.

Much love

Skipped my morning cigs!

This will be quit #7 and I feel really good about it this time.  I know the cravings are coming, so i'm just going to revel in the fact that I managed to get to work without the usual 2-3 cigarettes I smoke before I leave the house to load up on nicotine (I don't smoke at work). 

I know I'll be able to get through the work day.  The challenge will resume when I get home, but for now i'm enjoying being a non-smoker and feeling good about it.

Is the Patch making me feel really ill?

Hey Guys,

I was really hoping to get some advice from some Patch users to see if some of the recent health issues i'm experiencing might be me having an adverse reaction to the patch. 

I have been having frequent and intense bouts of dizziness (this is the key symptom) along with shakiness and nausea. These bouts have been happening for the last 3 weeks and I stopped smoking tobacco and cannabis after 10 years of heavy use about 4 weeks ago. I started on 21mg patches and am currently on the last few days of 14mg. I was planning to go down to 7mg next week. 

I didn't think this was to do with quitting, as these symptoms don't seem to be listed as withdrawals from either tobacco or cannabis (I have all the listed ones for sure), but i've been talking to a few people and someone said it could be the patch. 
So here I am, asking if anyone else has had this? And if so i guess i'll have to go the rest of the way cold turkey. 

Thanks for all your help and support, this place is a real source of encouragement.

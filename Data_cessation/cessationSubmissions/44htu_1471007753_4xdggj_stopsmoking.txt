About half a year ago...

About half a year ago, I was trying to definitely turn a page in my life. I had been smoking for about 10 years, and for a couple of them I was hating it. Smoking was getting in the way of my desire to become a better person. I remember pretty clearly how one day, when I saw a couple of guys playing soccer, I thought to myself that I couldn't play because I was a smoker. That thought shocked me, smoking had become an identity. The road was pretty bumpy and I failed many, many times. But here I am! My first 6 month after almost a decade! I started running and boxing and don't feel the need to hide myself behind this addiction anymore! It is amazing!

I'm going to be quitting in 2 weeks and I'm pretty nervous!

So I'll be 24 on the 17th and I've decided to stop smoking the day after my birthday celebration.

I'm pretty nervous because I know its gonna be hard, but I'm also kind of excited to not have something controlling me.

My main issue is, I think my temper will be pretty short. By no means am I an angry person, but the one time I'm pretty grouchy is in the morning before my coffee and cigarette.

Is there anything I can do in the 2 weeks I have left to try and make sure my morning pissy-ness will be lessened?

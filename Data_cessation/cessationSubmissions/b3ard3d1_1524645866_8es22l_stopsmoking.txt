Chest Infection - Common after quitting?

Havenâ€™t smoked in just over a month (yay!), but Iâ€™ve developed a really bad chest infection over the past week.... doesnâ€™t make sense! I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve ever had one before.

Anybody else have one shortly after quitting? Is it common? Or is it just bad luck on my part? ðŸ¤¨

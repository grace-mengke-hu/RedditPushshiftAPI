20 Hours since last cigarette feeling disoriented, vision seems off, cant focus or make decisions

It has been about 20 hours since I last smoked. I'm feeling dizzy/disoriented and lightheaded. My vision feels like its moving slower than my head and i feel a bit insane. I cant make a simple decision on anything. having trouble walking in a straight line if i look around too much. . Anyone experience this? and how long will it last? 

update: mouth feels numb

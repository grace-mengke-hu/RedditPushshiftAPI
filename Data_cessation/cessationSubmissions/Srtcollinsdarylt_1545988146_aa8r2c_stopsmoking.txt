Let’s try it i guess

I basically just smoke wayyy to much for a 24 year old. It’s been through stress though. I served as an infantryman in the Army, had a baby, and dealt with the passing of her mom and raising her alone for a tad bit until a family member stepped up to help me. I’ve smoked since 17 and always said “man I’ll just quit em when i feel like it”. It obviously doesn’t work that way. A year after her passing i started my current relationship. She doesn’t smoke and i want to quit. I don’t see it Being much harder than anyone else’s journey except the catch. My job sometimes requires me to literally fucking stand there. i smoke to pass the time. I wanna quit cos my daughters 2 now and overall it’s just getting old to me. I haven’t smoked in my house ever, and everytime i go into someone’s house that does it smacks me in the face, or getting out of my truck and going into the house, the clean air is just a so much better feeling. Unlike getting in my truck which i keep very cleaned and maintained and it still smells like an ashtray at a busy airport. 
I don’t want to vape. The one time i tried that i was addicted to both. 

Cold turkey is the way. I quit drinking alcohol awhile ago so that won’t be a factor thank god. My new girlfriend wants me to quit. But she doesn’t bitch about it. She’ll make it obvious to myself that i just lit a cigarette subconsciously though. What’s your pointers?

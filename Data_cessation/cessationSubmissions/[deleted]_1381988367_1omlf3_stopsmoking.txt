I just blew two and a half days

Hello everyone.
I went cold turkey Monday morning and made it through about 63 hours until I broke down and had a smoke.  I was doing okay through the end of day two, but on day three I woke up feeling worse than the day before.  Is this normal?  
I feel awful (mentally) and know I need to get back on the wagon.  Did I just undo the progress I made in terms of time before the worst of the cravings pass?  

Edit: As of 10/17/13 at 9:15 I'm back in the fight.  Thank you all for the kind words.  If anyone wants to help keep me honest that would be much appreciated!

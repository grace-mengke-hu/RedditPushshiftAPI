Found cigarettes in my dads car...

I knew my dad smoked a couple years ago but I thought he quit. When I was at college about a week ago I got a panicked text from my sister saying one of her friends saw my dad smoking a cigarette while walking the dog. I had my suspicions. I came back on Thursday and was watching him, and I noticed some of the telltales signs, but wasn't sure if I was putting signs where there were none. After walking the dog I went over to talk to him and I could smell the smoke on him. Tonight I silenced the house alarm grabbed his keys and went out to the car to look for them. I found a box of Salem 100's or something. Its 1 AM here, and I haven't brought them up since. My mom and my little sister brought up if he was smoking after he was caught by my sisters friend but his response was, "I smoked a long time ago". Obviously hes going to deny it until we can prove he still does it. My question for all of you is how should I go about having him stop smoking. I don't think he's addicted to them, I just think it's a really bad choice he makes as a way to relieve stress. I left a note on his pack, but removed it thinking the way I should go bringing it up is in person. Any advice?

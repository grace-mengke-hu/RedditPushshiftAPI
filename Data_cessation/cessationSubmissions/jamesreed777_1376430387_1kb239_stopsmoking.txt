been wanting to quit for a long time...

Have been half assing it for a while now. Tried to cut down from two packs a day to one, smoking lighter cigs, etc.

For some reason Saturday morning when I bought my last pack I though..."this really could be the last pack of smokes that I ever have to buy"

And I have not smoked one since Sunday morning.

In the past one slip up I seemed to keep having was holding onto a reservation that one day I would make it to a point where I could have just a few a week. Today I have let go of that . Also I quit telling myself how hard it would be, or how aggravated I will get with people. So basically I stopped making excuses this time.

There is a web site I frequent www.zenhabits.net and he uses an acronym of N.O.P.E (not one puff ever again) :)

The funny thing is next month marks 18 months clean for me in the program of narcotics anonymous and I know if I can lose the desire to use narcotics that I can lose the desire for nicotine. Zen habits also suggested joining an online support group, so here I am. Thank you guys :)

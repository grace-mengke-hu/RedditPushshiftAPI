Thank you <3

Today is 50 days since I quit smoking. I honestly never ever thought I could do it, but this community played a huge role in my quitting- so much so that I finally created a reddit account so I could quit lurking and actually post something. 
I was smoking a pack a day and constantly sneaking around because my SO hated it so much. I finally decided enough was enough and just stopped buying smokes. Haven't looked back since. This Reddit got me through the first few days when literally all I could think about was cigs and smoking. Now, it's a fleeting thought once or twice a day. So thank you all- I'm so, so happy and grateful to have cigarettes out of my life.

What turned you off cigarettes which inevitably lead you to quit smoking?

Was it a specific picture? A tragedy from a friend or family?  Alan Carr's book?   
  
Can you please share your stories? I think the easiest way for me, (and alot of others) to quit, is to me turned off the damn things!  
  
Thanks :)

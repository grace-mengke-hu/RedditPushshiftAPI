30 Days

To a lot of you, 30 days wouldn't be much.  

However, I quit 30 days ago, but am using an e-cig.  Yes, I realise this isn't the ideal situation but for the first time I can remember, I found myself running around the garden playfully chasing the dog!  I was out of breath after but recovered rather quickly.

Consider me happy!:)

Failed again

Why is the house so dusty? My cables are a mess... When will that storage room get cleaned out? What happens if the house burns down and I lose all my stuff and have to start over? When will she start working again? I suck at dieting... When I die, what will people do with my computer and all the letters and photos I've saved in a tote?

Anyone else have to deal with minor stress turning borderline psychotic? And smoking just makes it worse, adds another one on the pile.

Anyway, I'll get there, but I just feel like I need to learn when to be productive and when to just chill and play RDR2.  Thoughts?

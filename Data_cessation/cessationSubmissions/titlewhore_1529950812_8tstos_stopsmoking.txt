my stupid fucking story

I have smoked off and on (more on than off) for 10 years. I have stopped for a few months, then dove right back into it. Every time I quit, I knew it was just going to be fir a brief moment in time because I knew that I would eventually cave and get back into it because I have no willpower, and I enjoy the stupid fucking feeling of smoking.

Just three weeks ago I went to a destination bachelorette party where no one knew that I smoked, so I didn't smoke for 4 days. It wasn't even hard, because I knew that I could light up the second I got home. 

I should have used that as my catalyst to quit, but I didn't. For no fucking reason. 

That is super stupid.

I ran out of cigarettes last night, and by a total coincidence, first thing this morning as I was lighting up a re-fry (because I am a disgusting person) I came across a picture of a smoker's lungs on facebook and it finally hit me. I have got to quit. I hide it from work, I hide it from most of my friends, I am totally ashamed, my lungs wheeze, I cough all the time... Fuck this. I am done. I hardly took a drag off of that re-fry, But I am still considering it my last cigarette.

So I haven't smoked in 5 hours and 17 minutes, and I know that this is a bold statement but I really and truly am so fucking done with smoking. I have never declared that before. I usually just say that I am slowing down, or cutting back or taking a break, but I am done now.

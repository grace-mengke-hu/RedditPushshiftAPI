Latest success in quitting.

My birthday hits in a couple of days and, having just finished reading Carr's book, I think now is the time. I've quit before, for varying lengths of time, but I think I'm ready for it to be a permanent deal this time. So I'm considering this to be the first in  what will hopefully be a long series of victories. Just figured I'd share and wish all the best to others working on kicking it.

What would you do with $10 000?

Here in Canada cigs are almost $20 a pack for some brands! (I know Australia  is worse, chill) 
I was talking with my mom about how her and her husband would save over 10 grand a year if they quit smoking which seems crazy! 

So, what would you do with $10 000 dollars next year??   *cannot be used towards debt or mortgage*

Weight gain advice?

Quit cigarettes back in June 2014 and switched entirely to e-cigs. My fiance asked me to stop all nicotine for Valentines Day and I said yes so will be nicotine free as of 2-14-18.

I'm worried about the weight gain ... I exercise 3-4 times a week and eat healthy overall but I heard that even quitting just ecigs is enough to cause weight to be added ... I'm getting married in May and don't want to look like a balloon. Any times on how you guys handled it??

Btw first reddit post :)

Stopping after smoking for 1 year

It's now 1:17pm EST and I've smoked my last cigarette.  I'm not sure what to expect from this, or posting this, but I want to stop - I hate it.  It gives me headaches, it makes my fingers tingle sometimes, and I don't feel good physically from smoking yet I keep on doing it.  It just makes me feel bad all over, as if my body keeps yelling at me for doing it.
So I'm going cold turkey...
Please wish me luck!

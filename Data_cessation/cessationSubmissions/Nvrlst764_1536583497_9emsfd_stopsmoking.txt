Serial quitter here.

I've been going back and forth trying to quit the past 2 years. Sometimes making it a month and sometimes a few weeks before I cave and end up lighting up. Allen Carr's method worked for me the first time and it was easy to get through the first few days, just like he said. What I didn't pay attention to so much was that warning he put in the back of the book (I'm paraphrasing) saying 'just because it's easy the first time, won't make it so easy the next.' I chose to smoke again about 6 weeks later. 

Since that first quit I've read the book probably 10 times. Unfortunately it has not been as effective. When I read it, I can anticipate some of the things he's going to say, before I even read the words. It is as if I'm desperately hanging onto this book to help me again, be when I need to be trying to help myself. 

I've tried most NRT methods as well, as chantix, (felt like I was having a psychotic break at one point), and also hypnosis. I'm 34 and I've been smoking about 20 years, here lately I've been smoking a pack a day, just pounding the shit out of my lungs. 

There comes a time when we all have to be accountable for our own actions. Hopefully the next time I post it will be something super positive about having been quit for 2 weeks or something.

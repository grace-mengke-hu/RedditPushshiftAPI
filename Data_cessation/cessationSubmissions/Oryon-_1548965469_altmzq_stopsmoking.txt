18 days today.

Hi fellow nicotine-free champs,

&amp;#x200B;

I quit January 13th, after failing my new year resolution which was to not smoke any cigarettes during 2019 (new year, new me right?) and I think that was the main reason I quit. I had tried many times and failed, all of those times had something to do with a date or an event. "I'll quit next month", "I'll quit next year", "I'll quit after my friend's birthday party". That day didn't really mean anything to me, I just quit. Now, let's not say it has been easy, I've been wanting to smoke at every single gathering I've been at, yes, every single one and guess what? That's okay, that's fine. Everytime I want to I remind myself how good will I feel if I just don't fall for it this time vs how bad will I feel if I fall for it.

18 days today, not a month, not a year, just 18 days.

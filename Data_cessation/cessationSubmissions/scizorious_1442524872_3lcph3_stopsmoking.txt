Teeth Whitening

I am sure it will come as no surprise to any of you that after 15 years of heavy tobacco use, my teeth aren't all that white. I have never attempted to whiten my teeth because I figured I was throwing money down the drain (why I didn't feel that way about tobacco is beyond me). 

So, when I hit 3 months I want to whiten my teeth so that I can actually smile big and bright in photos. Any recommendations? I am willing to do professional whitening, but if there are any OTC products that work well I am willing to give those a try too. 

I want sparkly white teeth, not Ross Geller teeth.

Thanks for any feedback in advance! Keep up the work everyone, it is great to be a non-tobacco user!

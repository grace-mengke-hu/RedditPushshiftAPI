Working at a gas station makes it so hard

So I've been actively trying to quit smoking for months, but You wouldn't know it by observing my behavior. I work at a gas station, so I'll spend seven hours a day surrounded by cigarettes and selling them to people. I'll do so good, won't smoke before going into my shift, and then I'll be there all day and by the time I'm done with my shift, there is nothing I want more than one of those damn smokes I've been forced to handle all day. So then I'll grab a pack before I head out, smoke the one, hate myself, smoke another. Then I'll realize what's happening, throw the pack out, and then go back to work the next day and repeat the process. I feel stuck. 

I have a good five days off in a row through some scheduling miracle next week, so I may have a chance to get over it then, but I'm just so scared of coming back to work.

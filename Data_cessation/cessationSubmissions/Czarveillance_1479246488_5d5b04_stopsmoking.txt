I can love my family without worry again!

Before my wife and I were married she said that she did not want to be married to a smoker.  It was her deal-breaker so I quit.  That did stick for a few years, even after we had our first daughter, but at some point I became a secret smoker. I was a secret smoker off-and-on for at least 16-17 years or so (it's easy to lose track).  I was able to quit for extended periods of time and actually quit smoking for longer than I was smoking during that time.  While I was smoking without them knowing, however, I found that I was always scared and worried that they would find out.  I was always scared of getting caught, not to mention angry with myself for not having been able to stay quit.  I found myself trying to avoid hugging and kissing my family after I had been smoking, or trying to find ways to clean the smell off and brush my teeth whenever possible so they wouldn't suspect.  When my daughter was 17 and my son was four (just this past summer) my wife caught me smoking, I confessed it to my children, and after some anger, disappointment, and resentment all around we began the process of healing.  Back to my point, however...now that my secret is out and my family was forgiving enough to agree to move forward with me I found the strength to stay quit.  It has so far been 151 days. I've found so much joy in being able to freely hug, hold, kiss, and love them without restraint.  I don't have to worry about how my breath will taste (aside from possible bad breath of whatever I previously ate) when I kiss my wife or how I smell when I hug my children.  I'm able to freely work on "us" without that dark cloud of hiding anymore.  
I'm sure my situation is different from most of yours but in case it helps anyone I wanted to be sure to throw this story out there as one of the many benefits of finally quitting smoking.  The joy of showing affection freely to your loved ones is a gift I can't even do justice to with words.

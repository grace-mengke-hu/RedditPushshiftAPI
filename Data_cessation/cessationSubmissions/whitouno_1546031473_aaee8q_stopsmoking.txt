Awful relapse

I was 4 months without smoking and I have some psychological problems. Last night I had a crisis and when I got better I went out to buy cigarettes, I brought the cheapest. It was horrible, the smoke was awful and I started to cough a lot.

Now I'm without my 4 months, my psychologist is on vacation and I have a pack of horrible cigarettes. That's it. Now, i'm kinda lost... idk what to do.

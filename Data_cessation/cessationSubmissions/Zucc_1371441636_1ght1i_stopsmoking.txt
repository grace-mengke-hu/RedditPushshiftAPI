Two Months.

Never thought I'd see the day.  60 days in, and I feel like I've honestly kicked it.  I feel like I can really say that I'm a non-smoker.  The first couple of weeks were rough, but the last month has really been easier than I ever thought it would be.  

The biggest thing I've noticed so far is the enhanced sense of taste & smell.  It's almost like I've developed a sixth sense.  I drove along the ocean the other day and almost had to stop the car from the depth of the smells.  It's shocking to realize that the way I thought everything smelled was wrong.  It's like seeing in black and white your whole life, and suddenly developing the ability to see in color.

Thanks for getting me through those first tough days, guys.  Not sure I would have stuck with it had I not been reading and posting here.  For those of you in your first few days, stick with it.  It gets better.  Don't allow yourself any excuses.  There is no "just one more".

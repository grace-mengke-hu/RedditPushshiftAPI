Im Lost...Doomed!!

how can i stop....i just cant go past 18 -24 hrs without lighting one up. the thought of giving up smoking is so dreadful tht i smoke more than before because in my heart, deep down, i know that i have to quit sooner rather than later. its affecting my health, my relationship and giving me ED (sorry for the description) but i have to let it out. i have now had several episodes of ED in the past month which i believe is because of my 1 .5 pack a day habbit for the last 18 years or so. The experiance is so agonizing that now i dread going to sex. i dont know if quitting can do any good but i have to give it a try. i get this empty feeling at around 18 -24 hrs and the monster starts creeping up rattling my inner till i light one. i feel so helpless, lost and doomed!!! I have no motivation at all and nothing positive to look up to...

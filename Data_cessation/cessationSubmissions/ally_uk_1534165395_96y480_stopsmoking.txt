Quit Vaping Going through Hell need advice.

Hi guys I recently went cold turkey on vaping I had vaped for about 4 years I was vaping about 11MG medium strength but would literally glued to the bloody thing. 

Anyways thought I would write a post on here as I am having a bit of a tough time. 

Today is my 7th day without nicotine, I have been experiencing extreme dizziness the only way to describe the feeling is my legs feel like they are about to give way when I am walking. I am also suffering from inability to focus or concentrate and a really bad spaced out not in control of myself kind of feeling. 

Is this normal? should I be concerned?

How long will it take to feel some form or normality?

228 days later & 10km run

I quit cold turkey after smoking for 12 years, was pissed of at everything for the first 3 days but I rationalized my thinking that it was just because of the withdrawals. Just remember it's not a primary need in life. 

Immediately after I quit smoking I started running, to get more stamina and not gain weight. It was hard as hell but it only motivated me to run more because I realized how much damage I did to my lungs in those 12 years of smoking. I had to stop every few minutes because I was out of breath. 

But I kept running and lifting weights, signed up for a competition to train even harder. A few days ago I enlisted for a test run of the route we're going to run for the 10k competition. I am now in the advanced runner category. 

I ran with people who can run the 10k in 37 minutes but I could keep up with them not stopping the whole 10k. I just liked to tell my story here cause every time I had a hard time with not smoking I would come here and read stories of other people struggling with it. 

Become the best version of yourself.

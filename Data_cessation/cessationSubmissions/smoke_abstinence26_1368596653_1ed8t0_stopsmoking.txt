Anyone else just quit? Cold turkey?

I quit smoking about two months ago. I was sick and I just decided to quit. I barely gave it a second thought after smoking for ten years. When I am a little drunk now I definitley feel the itch. I'm scared it was too easy and I am going to fall back into it somehow. For the record I was a 3-5 cigarette a day smoker.

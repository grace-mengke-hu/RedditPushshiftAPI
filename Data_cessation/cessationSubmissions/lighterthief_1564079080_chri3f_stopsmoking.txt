You can do it

Hey guys I just wanted to wish you all well however far you are along, take it one day at a time and if you can make it through the difficult days then it just gets easier and easier. I advocate cold turkey as this is what worked for me and Allen Carr's stop smoking book/strategy. Getting off nicotine is one of the achievements I am happiest to have done and once I would have found it unimaginable to stop. I wish you all the best of fortune.

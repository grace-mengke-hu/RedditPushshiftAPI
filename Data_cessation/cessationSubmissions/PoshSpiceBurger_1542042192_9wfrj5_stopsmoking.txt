One day done and feeling weirdly okay

I read most of Allen Carr’s stop smoking book and while I started skimming towards the end I took a lot of the messages out it like smoking is basically a cycle that can’t  be broken until you decide to break it - which is what I’ve done! 

The little nicotine monster has tried to convince me to smoke today but I was like why go through the withdrawal symptoms right now just to go back to it? Again - all stuff from the stop smoking book! 

Anyway here’s hoping I sleep well tonight and by 4PM Wednesday the worst of the withdrawal symptoms should be done - off to the gym now to get some of those amazing endorphins and kick this withdrawal headache!

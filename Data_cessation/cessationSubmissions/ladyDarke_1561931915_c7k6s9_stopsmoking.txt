Stopped and started.. Now, I’m done..

So after a few false starts, I’m on the wagon again. But it’s sticking this time. My smell is coming back, and it’s great. What’s not so great.. the fact that the smoke that’s been expelled from my body I can smell, and clothes. Even though I don’t smoke at home, some of my furniture has hints of tobacco in it: I’m on a workout program now,  and breathing is getting better too. I used to sleep a lot on top of it. I’m beginning to wake up earlier instead of when the alarm hits. Hopefully, all goes well this time around.

So unsociable

Gave up last (week) Sunday, but after 5 days decided to smoke on the Friday night, jeez it was unsociable. Leaving a good conversation, dinner table and then kept coming out of the bar and then club to have a puff. Why do we do it? It felt fucking horrible standing in the cold just to have a smoke....

Anyway, that was 6 days ago and have stayed off of them since and have no real inclination to smoke again... Only downside is I had to renew my badge :(

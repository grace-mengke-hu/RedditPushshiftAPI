A week in and some thoughts.

My story is a prolly a lil different that most here. I wasn't a teenage smoker. I experimented while in my early 20s smoking when I got drunk... I can almost distinctly remember the awful taste in my mouth the morning after those late night drunken smokes. 

Well life happened along the way, got married it didn't work out after a few years and bang fast forward 5 years or so and I'm 30 smoking pretty much daily to "deal with the stress". 

I met a wonderful woman shortly after but could not kick the smoking habit. She hated it and I went thru all the tricks to hide it. 

Recently we learned of a baby in the oven due any day now. For me that was hopefully enough to kick this habit forever. I've been 1 week cold turkey and feel amazing. 

No more lies
No more hiding 
No more killing myself from cancer sticks 

If you are scared that's ok! Be brave. My mouth feels amazing. My car is starting to smell good again. I don't feel the need to stop and find a cover up for my smell any longer. 

Take a strong look in the mirror. Today is the day. Nothing is solved by inhaling cigarette smoke. Get out there and live again!

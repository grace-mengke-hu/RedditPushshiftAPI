Wellbutrin. I'm finally quitting! Really this time.

I told my doctor I was ready to quit smoking today, but the patch made me anxious and emotional. It also made me sleep all day. So he prescribed Wellbutrin. 

Any one else try this method? Did it work for you? Side effects? 

Also, any other tips would be appreciated. I'm so done.

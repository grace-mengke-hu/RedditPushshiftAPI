I'm tired

I'm tired of trying to use cigarettes to deal with my emotions

I'm tired of getting sad or mad and buying a pack and smoking that first cigarette expecting a crutch that calms me down and 'brings me up', but then before the last drag is exhaled that 'crutch' stresses me out physically and mentally, and 'brings me down'( aggravates my depressive tendencies and affects my entire behaviour of that day).

I'm tired of not doing what I love and enjoy because I smoked cigarettes that day and so the nicotine combined with my mental state killed the 'fighting spirit' that gets me on that skateboard or gets me on top of that building I've been yearning to explore after dark.

I'm tired of buying a pack then smoking one, and breaking the rest of the cigarettes to try to buy me time without nicotine and make a positive but financially costly statement to myself.

I'm tired of subjecting my non-smoker friends to cigarette smoke when they ride in my car.

I'm tired of justifying degradation and destruction of my own body
I'm tired of giving up feeling physically fabulous, and mentally blissful, for feeling physically OK, and mentally fucked up.

I'm tired of dishonouring my grandfather by still smoking after his death from lung cancer brought on by a life of smoking

I am a mental case
I am exhausted of destroying and degrading the community of trillions of cells that is my body. 
I am exhausted of fucking up my fragile mind
I am exhausted of dampening my spirit, that has only ever tried to wake my dreams into reality
I am exhausted
I am done
I will not fail

4 months and cravings are creeping up again

Hey guys, for the past couple weeks I've been getting some strong cravings, probably the worse they've been since the first week. I'm not sure why, I feel great and life has been pretty stress free. I'm heading out of town tonight for a little bonfire party my buddy is having and it's the first time I've been to his place since I quit. Typically it would be chain smoking and drinking all night long and that's all I can think about right now. The thought of going down there and not smoking seems foreign and like I'd be missing out. I fully intend to stay strong though, hopefully writing out this post is push I need to survive tonight. I've never come close to quitting for this long and the thought of throwing that all away is keeping me strong.

I'm on a three day project away from my office. Were I a smoker, an event like this would not have deterred my smoking. In fact I would have made sure I had enough to smoke in unfamiliar places. I need to treat drawing the same way. Bought a mobile board. Presenting #049 Venomoth. See you tomorrow.

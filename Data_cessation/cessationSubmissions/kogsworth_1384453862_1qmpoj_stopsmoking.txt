What symptoms should I expect?

Hi guys,
I've quit smoking a few days ago, and I've been mostly fine with it. The only thing is that I've been particularly tired. Like, my body and mind just feel weak, like I haven't slept for long enough or worked out too much. I didn't expect to feel this, have you guys felt anything like this?

Why I stopped smoking

Hi Guys

Stopped the foggy habit two months ago. Having close to none cravings atm. I thought I'd stop by for a moment and share why I stopped. 

So, I smoked ca. ten cigarettes a day. Not too much but still not nothing. The main dilemma for me was that it sucked out too much of my energy. I hated being tired from going up stairs, walking a little distance and standing too long. It felt very embarrassing as a young man of 25 years to be like that and admit it. Our body is such a powerful bio-machine and I've had chosen to pollute it with smoke day in day out. It didn't feel good and right so I chose to stop. 
I liked cigarettes and I still wouldn't demonize them. I tried it and after a while I didn't appreciate the habit anymore. 
If I could give one tip it would be this: Even one cigarette you'd normally smoke and chose not to will save you in the long run. Every little baby-step is important and something to be proud of.

Stay strong, friends

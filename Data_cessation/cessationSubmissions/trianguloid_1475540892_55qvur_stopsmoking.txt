quit with Easy Way and started again. now Easy Way isn't working.

Hey guys. I smoked in high school, quit after about 2 years. 7 years later, started smoking again during my college party days. 10 years of pack-a-day later I finally quit after listening to the Easy Way audiobook. Before quitting, I was absolutely miserable. Repeated bronchitis, pneumonia, couldn't run longer than 15 minutes tops, etc etc. I was so, so relieved and glad to finally quit. Well, that lasted a year and a half. a great year and a half. not once during that time did I want one. Not even for a moment. No cravings, nothing. 

Well, fast forward to about 4 months ago. Started a new, very high stress job with a bunch of Germans. They all smoke. 2 weeks into the job and I was smoking a pack a day again. and now I'm back to where I was...I fucking hate smoking. every single one. yet I'm smoking more than ever...2 packs a day some days. and i live in NYC, which means unless I buy them at one of the illegal bodegas, they are $14/pack. I hate every thing about it. the smell, the taste, the effect on my teeth, my breathing, the money, the rather unpleasant effects from poor circulation (blacking out and...well, rigidity problems), etc etc. etc. Yet, I've listened to Easy Way 2 full times through and only made it a day without a smoke. I'm at my wit's end and really don't know what to do other than drop $500 and get hypnotized. 

any suggestions appreciated.

Tips for new quitters

Just a couple of tips for those starting out the quitting journey..... hopefully others here can add to the list

When you start your quit do so by having  a shower, brushing your teeth and changing into fresh clothes. Start afresh by getting rid of the smell of stale cigarettes from your person.

By a new tooth brush....you'll really notice the taste of cigarettes on your old brush if you use it in the days after your quit.

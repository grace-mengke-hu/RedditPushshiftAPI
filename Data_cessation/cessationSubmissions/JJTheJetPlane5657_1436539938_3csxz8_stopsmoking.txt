Smoke-free for 50 days, here's what's worked for me

I find everyone's quitting stories to be motivational and helpful, especially when people talk a little bit about what the quitting path has looked like for them.

So I haven't had a cigarette in almost 50 days now. I'm lucky that I haven't smoked for that long, only a year. 

I started smoking when I lived in Europe and everyone there made spliffs. At first I didn't smoke cigarettes, just the tobacco in spliffs but I started buying packs to mix and one thing lead to another. 

I moved back to America and continued to smoke in my first year of college. I never smoked that much, some days when I was really stressed I'd smoke half a pack-a pack and a half a day but normally I would smoke 5 cigarettes a day. 

I quit smoking for a few reasons, mostly because I have asthma so it's stupid for me to smoke, I didn't enjoy not feeling like I could breathe sometimes, smoking was irritating my throat/sinuses, and my girlfriend wanted me to quit (although she wasn't annoying about it, she would sit with me on our patio while I smoked and never really said anything about it but if asked she would say she wanted me to stop). 

**What worked for me:** I quit cold turkey. I smoked my last cigarette with a beer on my balcony with my girlfriend, and that was the last time I bought a pack. I used to take smoke breaks at work, and the cravings were really strong while I was eating lunch or something. So replacing smoking with something else helped me.

A lot of people will replace smoking with food, but I don't agree with that. It works for some people, but my personal experience my friends who replaced it with food (even healthy food) gained some weight.

So I replaced smoking with water. [This is the water bottle I bought](http://www.amazon.com/Thermos-Nissan-Intak-Hydration-Bottle/dp/B001EGGQB6/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1436539421&sr=8-1&keywords=thermos+water+bottle&pebp=1436539437117&perid=0WVZCER7XBR1HXX1DW79), I like it because it has a little meter with ounces of water on the side. There's also a ring at the top numbered 1-6 and you can keep track of how much water you've had during the day. 

Whenever I felt myself wanting to smoke a cigarette I tried to redirect my thoughts to 1) drinking some water 2) trying to think about how much water I've drank today. 

I also started smoking weed (regularly) at night about 2 weeks in to help me cope. That might not be an option for everyone, but it helped lessen my nicotine cravings and help me deal with anxiety.

**Weird stuff that happened to me**

The first week and a half or so were kind of easy outside of the cravings. But week two hit my hardcore with anxiety. I don't know why, but it was like hitting a wall of bricks. I have an anxiety disorder already, but this certainly didn't help. I just had to power through it, I felt really crappy for maybe 3 weeks (some days were better than others).

At 47 days in I don't have to smoke weed daily anymore to help me cope. I still get nicotine cravings, but it's more sad than driving and all-consuming. The thought of not smoking another cigarette again makes me sad, I liked nicotine. I don't think cigarettes are disgusting or anything, I didn't have an adjustment period to it.

I was really hungry for maybe 2 1/2 weeks after quitting, it didn't kick in until 3 days after quitting. It sucked, but I made an effort to not change my eating habits (I've lost a lot of weight in the past year and I don't want to gain it back). I'll try to drink more water. I'll try to eat a healthy snack (a greek yogurt, a salad). Eventually I'll forget about it, or at least suffer through being hungry until the time that I actually wanted to eat.

Also it's still extremely difficult for me to see someone else smoking. In general, I'll try to remove myself from the situation if possible (walk away from them, go inside). I try not to make people feel bad about smoking, but I have asked to be moved to a table inside at a restaurant.

There are also times I can't remove myself from a situation, and I've had to deal with someone smoking a cigarette right in front of me (sitting at a table) while trying to quit. It really sucked, but I just try to look away or take deep breaths and remove myself as soon as possible. 

If I'm having a particularly bad day, my girlfriend is very sweet and supportive. She'll listen to me talk about cravings or wanting to smoke, tell me she's impressed and proud that I quit, and give me hugs. 

So that's my .02 :)

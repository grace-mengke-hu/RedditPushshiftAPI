5.67 days in... but who's counting... grrrðŸ˜¤

So I quit as a New Year's resolution, and I'm doing okay so far. The cravings have been manageable (though last night I had a couple drinks and almost had to strap myself down to keep from buying a pack... holy trigger, Batman).

I have two main worries that are making this tough. The first is that I live with the pack-a-day-smoking love of my life, and while he's been astoundingly supportive, I'm nervous about the ever present temptation factor.

The second worry is that I've quit before (once for 7 years!!!) and I'm here counting the minutes again. On one hand, I know I can do it; I have history as proof. But on the other, I'm super bummed to think that I may eventually start back up, and find myself in this exact same place yet again. 

Anyway, I raise my lollipop to all of you for your remarkable stories of willpower! Keep up the hard work!

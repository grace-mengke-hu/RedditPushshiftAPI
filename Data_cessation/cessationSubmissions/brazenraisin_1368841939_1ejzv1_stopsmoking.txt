Confused and seeking help

I'm sixteen years old. In the past month or two, I've been smoking quotidian cigarettes--usually between two and six a day. I had previously smoked weed as often, and my quitting of this undoubtedly instigated the newer habit. I'm a fairly antsy and restless person, and going for a walk and having a smoke between activities seems to be the most meditative and relaxing thing in the world. These jaunts are never unaccompanied with a fair amount of guilt, in the endless diseases and ailments provoked by the tobacco. Presently, the idea of not being able to smoke throughout the day and night seems unfathomable. How can I go about fixing this? Any help would be eternally appreciated.

Love,
The Brazen Raisin

I had a panic attack.

Day two was much harder than day one. I started my day with an 80 mile drive, after waking up much too late, to the radio station to cover a big deal day time radio show. I'm a radio jockey by the way. I was already really anxious about this job today, but when I finally made it into the station and realized I forgot my notes/prep; I began to freak. Even after a life saving brief from the jock before me panic really began creeping in.

I do my first on-air break and blew it. It was so awful! Second on-air break was even worse. At that point I've lost hope. I'm feeling so overwhelmed. Normally at this part into a shift at the station I've had at least one smoke and three on the car ride up. I couldn't stop thinking about how I really wanted a smoke and how awful I was sounding on the radio, embarrassing not only myself but the station. I felt like I was letting myself and the entire team down. At this point I begin to shake and cry uncontrollably. 

Fortunately, my SO was available to talk so I call him up and he calms me down. He again reminds me that this isn't any different than what I do on the weekends and that the team wouldn't have asked me to cover unless I was capable of doing a great job. I let myself cry it out, we say I love yous, and I stick another piece of gum in my mouth and press on.

After that I felt a million times better. The show was far from perfect, but allowing myself to cry and shake it out helped so much.  Also reassuring words were nice too. 

Looking back it's sort of scary how much control smoking has over my being. Gives me even more reason to stay away. I don't like that feeling, and I hate being dependent on anything.

Side note: I picked up some bubble wands. I found on /r/Anxiety a user suggested blowing bubbles to help regulate breathing when you're feeling anxious and such. I think this will also make a fun and excellent substitute to smoking that I can enjoy with my smoker friends.

The ol' reddit snaperoo

I remembered reading a few years ago, when I were just a wee no named lurker and just dreaming about quitting the cigs, about wearing rubber bands on your wrist and giving yourself a right snappy snap with every craving. 

Well happy to report it stings like a bastard and while I still have severe cravings 3 weeks in, I think overall it just gives me something else to thing about in the very short term, rather than any deep aversion therapy.

Would recommend.

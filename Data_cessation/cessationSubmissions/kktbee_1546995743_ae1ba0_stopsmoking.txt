Dreamt I Had a Craving

I dreamt, on day 3, that I had forgotten that I had quit smoking; I routinely put my coat on, grabbed a cigarette and started to walk outside to smoke it.  I suddenly stopped walking when I remembered that I was trying to quit, I had a nic fit, and said, " Aw, fuuck it!" and continued for the door.  BUT I quickly stopped myself again and said, "No, I'm not going to, I've been doing good."

I'm really glad that I had this dream.  It was like I was agreeing with myself that I am ready to stop saying "fuck it", that I am ready to work as hard as I can to be healthier and more engaged in life.  It has helped me to be able to make the same decision when I get cravings when awake. 

Yay!

I am on day 8.

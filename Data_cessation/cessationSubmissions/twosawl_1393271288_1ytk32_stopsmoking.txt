I'm trying to quit still

Nothing is working. 
While taking Valium I noticed I had no craving for cigarettes,  though valium is also very addicting. 

My question is,  since I am at the end of my rope and even with it feeling like my throat is swelling shut I can't bring myself to stop,  shall I attempt to quit on valium? 

The cons is valium addiction builds in two weeks time.

7 days in...

I'm 35, I started smoking at 13 but not steady until 16.  I've tried to quit a few times over the years.  I never made it very far because I would find reasons to cheat.   The longest I've gone without a smoke over the past 20 years  was while I was in jail for 30 days.  While I was in jail it wasn't bad because I had no way to get my hands on a smoke.   When I got out,  I basically went right back at it.  I think I am finally ready to quit.   I feel like crap all the time.  Today I'm 7 days into it.  I have been using lozenges to get this far, and let me tell you it still sucked..  It wasn't as bad as I thought but not great at all.   I've tried to act normally this week, but it is hard doing some of my usual activities.   I hope the next week's get easier..  I can tell you that if you are just starting,  it gets better after a few days.   Not great but better.  The first few days I found myself asking, what do non smokers do?  What do they do after they eat, what do they do after they get up, what do they do after the show on tv is over..  I can say at this point im starting to figure out what they do..  "they do the same thing as us, just without the nasty cigarettes!"  All I know is that I keep telling myself to stay strong,  and that I'm a non smoker..  lf you are just starting out,  congratulations...  Keep it up!  We can all do this...

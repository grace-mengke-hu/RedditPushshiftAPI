Munchie Madness.

I just bumped down to 3 mg on the vape and I plan to go to 0 in 2 weeks.  Every time I transition down in nicotine my appetite spikes.  I'm trying to just fill up on healthy stuff and have treats only once or twice a day. Even with daily exercise my weight has climbed about 2 pounds this past month.

How long does it take for the munchie madness to go away?

Going on 72 hours, already feeling much better.

Hello redditors, I just wanted to share my current, ongoing progress, and also tell you all how I'm feeling in just a short period of time. 

I decided to quit smoking at random just 3 days ago (2/24/2018), and I've read that it takes 72 hours (3 full days) for nicotine to completely leave your system, and although I should be at peak withdrawal, I'd have to say I'm already feeling SO much better. It's probably partly due to my increased self-confidence, and plus I've recently started exercising, eating healthier, and focusing on getting proper sleep. All I know is this is definitely one of the best decisions a smoker could make for themselves.

I'd also like to say that if you're considering quitting smoking, let me just tell you that you CAN do it if you set your mind to it. As for those of you ex-smokers, keep up the wonderful progress.

I hope you all have a great day/night, and best of wishes to you all.

17 days, lots of positives, but have started bad sinus issues - anyone else?

17 days down after 12 years smoking, so feel great about that. Already enjoying being able to breathe properly and not feel like I’m going to hit the deck after 5 mins of exercise! 

But the last week I’ve had really bad sinus problems. I’ve had this before at quit attempts and it’s even made me re-start again because for whatever reason that has always solved it. When I smoke, no sinus problems. When I quit, sinuses super inflamed and stuffed up. Though I’ve never fully quit for longer than 6 weeks (yet! I will do this time) 

Anyone else experience this? I’ve tried to research what this is all about but not much out there that’s proper science. It sounds like it could be inflammation from tissue healing and cilia regrowth that will gradually get better over time. I’ve also read results from a study that suggested that cigarette smoke being an irritant actually helps keep things flowing (in the absence of  cilia). So makes sense that some people may have these issues when they quit - at a point where cilia not functioning properly yet but there’s no smoke irritant to keep things ticking along. 

Anyway, really don’t want to restart over an issue like this. Just a bit hard to see the light at times! I guess I’m kind of after understanding if anyone had these issues for a few weeks and that they actually got better

Thanks gang!

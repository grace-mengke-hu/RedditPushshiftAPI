Day 7 complete

One week !!!! That's right, 7 days without smoking. And I should be proud of myself, but I am not. I am still scared that I may smoke anytime in the future. I am not worried about the cravings, cause I am not getting them frequently. May be once a day or so. I am worried because I feel that I am missing a cigarette. I also don't know what gives me pleasure, other than smoking. I am still looking for something that can replace smoking and may be get my mood elevated.

Anyway, I will stay strong and will not smoke. 7 days is not easy, and I got this far. Let the run continue. Thanks for reading.

Light to medium intensity smokers?

I've occasionally lurked on this subreddit for a while and haven't seen a ton of advice for people who only smoke a handful of cigarettes a day, but are still very much addicted to nicotine. I've been smoking for 8 years, but only about 5 cigarettes per day on average. In fact, I don't think I have EVER smoked more than 15 cigarettes in a 24 hour period. I've found that some of the standard "quit smoking" might be geared more toward people who smoke 1-2 packs per day or more.

Does anybody who has quit share a similar experience? Have you noticed any of the standard "quit smoking" advice that doesn't seem to apply to lighter (but still addicted) smokers?

One thing I've found is that my physical withdrawal symptoms peaked much earlier, like around 24 hours. Everything I've heard says it would happen at around the 3-day mark.

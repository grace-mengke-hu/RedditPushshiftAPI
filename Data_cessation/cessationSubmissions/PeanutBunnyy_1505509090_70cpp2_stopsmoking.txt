Do you ever stop wanting to smoke?

I'm on day 37. 

Yes, I know what you're going to say. 'It's a filthy habbit', 'I realized how gross it was after I quit', 'It's disgusting and I feel a zillion times better now', etc.

I get it. Smoking IS gross. It IS disgusting. That's why I quit. But despite that, I do miss smoking every single time I think about it. My chest tightens as I imagine myself puffing on that gloriously disgusting stick of death and inhaling that nastyass smoke. And I miss it. Don't get me wrong, I'm so glad I was able to quit and I do feel better and healthier now. But I still miss it sometimes.

Do you ever STOP missing it? Or am I always going to be a non-smoker that wishes they could smoke? :(

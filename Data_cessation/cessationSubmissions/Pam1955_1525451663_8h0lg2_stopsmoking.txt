day 1 -AGAIN!!

so frustrated.  I keep trying to quit and give in after 24- 26 hours.  I need to quit for good.  I quit for 10 years and picked it back up and smoked for another 8 years.  I have this fear that keeps telling me I can't quit - you went for 10 years and went back to it.  I need to believe that I can do it.  I just don't know how.

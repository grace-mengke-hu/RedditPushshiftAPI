Are these symptoms usual when smoking?

I am smoking since I was 15 (now 19). Since I went to college the habit has escalated to 1 pack a day and I know I have to get rid of this habit.

I don't need advice to stop smoking; I am planning to stop after the pack I've bought today and with the help of this subreddit and Allen Carr's book, I am making a serious attempt.

HOWEVER, and now I am coming to my point, I have some complaints and I need to know whether this is normal when smoking:

- Sometimes I have pain / feel stabs in areas mentioned in the picture attached. This is going on for over a year. This only occurs when I am smoking. Should I relate this to smoking or could there be other causes? Only meds I use are ritalin. 
- Bowel activity problems 
- Overall mentally tired

Should I be worried?

Thoughts on Fear

So today is the end of day 4 and I thought I would share what's been working for me this time around. This time I've focused my efforts around the idea of dissecting fear. I have been afraid to quit. The fear of what will happen if I don't smoke. The fear of what will happen if I don't give into a craving. The fear of what it will be like to go out to the bar and not allow myself a cigarette. And you know what? When I really think about it none of those things are very scary. Uncomfortable maybe, but not the type of thing nightmares are made of. I've realized I have nothing to fear by quitting. Every time in the past 4 days I've felt like I need a cigarette I say "I give myself permission not to be afraid of life as a non smoker." And so far it's been able to bring me enough comfort not to do it. Just some thoughts, maybe it will help someone.

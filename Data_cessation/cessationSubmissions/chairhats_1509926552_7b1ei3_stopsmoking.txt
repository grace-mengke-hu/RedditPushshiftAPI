2 Weeks Free-Checking In

Today is two weeks straight without a cigarette. I'm taking Chantix and trying to jog 30-40 minutes a day to deal with urges. My snacking/eating hasn't been too bad, and has generally been healthy. I would highly recommend pistachios for snacks- they're not very bad for you and the shelling action makes it perfect for fidgeting while satiating the oral fixation. I am having some "quitters flu," of course, but I believe I'm taking that in stride. 

The hard part has really been the minor stresses. I smoked for 21 years- more than half my life. I literally don't know what not smoking looks like. The exercise helps a lot, but I honestly don't know that I can keep that routine up. Its really the boredom and restlessness that bothers me the most. I feel trapped at times. It's still hot here in the south. I always knew that smoking was my security blanket that I would turn to in times of discomfort, and the heat definitely makes me uncomfortable. 

Does anyone have any suggestions for replacements for a new security blanket?

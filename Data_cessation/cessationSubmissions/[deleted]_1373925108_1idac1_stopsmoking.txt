I decided to quit smoking yesterday.

I smoke about a pack a day at this point. I'm 23 years old. I started at.. 18. Stopped for maybe a year and a half between then and now.

I have some friends who work at the local head shop so I had walked by there to hang out. They usually have some quality ecigs on display. I always argued the price to avoid getting a good one. Well, I talked it over with my girlfriend and we decided that if I could avoid buying a pack for two weeks it'll pay for itself and then some.

I went ahead and bought it ($50 bucks, 33% discount) and 3 bottles (18mg, 12mg, 0mg) for mixing to my taste.

I gave away my last cigarette to a homeless guy and continued home. Later on in the evening I started craving actual smoke, so I (to my chagrin) rolled two cigarettes with some swisher tobacco. 

Is it possible to quit smoking cigarettes and still enjoy the occasional medical mary-jane blunt?

Either way I'm feeling pretty confident and it's been a few hours since I woke up. I haven't smoked any tobacco but I've been puffing on my e-cigarette. The idea is to gradually lower phase out the 18mg for 12mg. Then the 12mg for 0mg.

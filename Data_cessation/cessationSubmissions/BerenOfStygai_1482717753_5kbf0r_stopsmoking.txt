I want to finally quit

I have been smoking for about 10 years now, and I want to quit. I am still very young (started as a teen because it was "cool"...) and have made some huge changes in my life recently including losing over 30 lbs, reading and drawing everyday again, exercising, etc. I tried to quit a month or so ago as it's basically the last big change I need to make as I continue to better myself, but it is fucking hard, you guy know. 

I tried by getting a nicotine vaporizer, but that really didn't cut it so I found myself smoking both that and cigarettes, which is just gross. 

I also tried cold turkey but I just became insanely irritated and mean. 

I need some advice from people that are in the same boat. What worked and didn't work for you? Are nicotine patches worth a shot? Should I try the vaporizer again but with higher doses of nicotine? 

Any advice, anecdotes or whatever will help. I's time to stop, I want to be healthy for myself, my girlfriend and family, and I can't do that as a smoker.

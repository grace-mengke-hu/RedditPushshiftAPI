Crazy dreams

Did anyone experienced those? I'm not talking about those 'standard' smoking in dream dreams, but last night I had some wild dreams, so vivid. It took me few minutes when I got up to realize it was just a dream and I feel messed up all day now, like I'm out of balance. Anyone had same issues?

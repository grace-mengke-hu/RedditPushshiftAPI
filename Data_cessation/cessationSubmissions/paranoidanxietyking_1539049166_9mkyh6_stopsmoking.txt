How F’d up are my lungs?

So, I’m in a bad way mentally and finding it very hard to stop smoking. 

But I have to as it’s making my life even more hell with crippling health anxiety.

I’ve been smoking for about 1.5 years now, and I feel that my breathing has gotten harder over the last two weeks. 

This may be anxiety, but it also may be smoking. And I’m freaked out that I already have COPD or the like as I had childhood asthma. 

Hope I can ask here, but what are the chances of this? As I’m freaking out constantly. 

But practically, what tests should I ask for to see if I have done any permanent damage? An unrelated lung x-ray 6-months ago was fine...

Thanks for reading guys. Struggling hard, and off to buy some nicotine mints in the meantime.

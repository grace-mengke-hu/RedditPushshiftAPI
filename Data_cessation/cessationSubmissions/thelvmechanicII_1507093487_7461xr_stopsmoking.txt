Day one

It's day one, decided to quit on the first of October but being in Las Vegas and the recent events I pushed it back a few days.  As of now it's been almost 24 hours no nicotine, from a pack a day.... Wow... this fucking sucks. But I promised myself that I was still smoking by the time I'm 30 I would quit no matter what.  Ive been smoking almost a pack a day since I was 15.  As of now I'm sitting in my room having wave after wave of anxiety, restlessness and other emotions run through my mind. I have no cigarette packs available to me. No easy way out. I need suggestions and any information please to help me get out of my mind and into the path of being tobacco free...

It makes me sad to hear of people failing

You know I only gave up 5 weeks ago (after 35 years) but I can't see why I would smoke again. In the 5 weeks I have:
Been to the pub - It was tough but ok
Had a row with the wife - The gum helped me there

There will be times when I'm tested more...real tragedies, but my state of mind is "cigs aren't the answer"

Wont lie, It troubles me when I hear of people going back to cigs after months/years...Maybe I wont ever be out of the woods!

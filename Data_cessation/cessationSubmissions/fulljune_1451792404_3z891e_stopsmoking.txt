Weight gain?

I quit smoking the day before Thanksgiving. I already notice myself gaining almost 10 pounds and I dont think it's just from the holidays. I know that in the long run the weight gain is temporary. But it still sucks! Any tips for not gaining weight when you quit? I've tried just eating healthier things, but I dont want to substitute food for smoking at all! Help please!

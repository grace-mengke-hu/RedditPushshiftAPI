For everyone just beginning, some reflections at 1 year (!!!)

You guys, just... wow. Here we are, [a year later](https://i.imgur.com/rgEwWYh.png). I honestly cannot believe I haven't bought a pack of cigarettes in a year, something I previously had done about every other day since 1998. I owe a lot of gratitude to a lot of strangers on this subreddit for helping me along in the first few weeks and months of the last year. A *lot.* And because I took so much silent satisfaction and comfort in reading the reflections and advice of others who had done this before me, I'd like to put in my own two cents for anyone struggling, succeeding, considering, and everything else on the spectrum.

1. **Just start already.** I used to get so caught up in planning strategies that would one day get me out of smoking that I'd never make a decision to actually stop smoking. I remember spending weeks agonizing over the best quit date to set about six months in advance, and then endlessly pushing it back because a birthday party got announced, or a stressful work trip, or a holiday drive, or... whatever else I could use to procrastinate. In the end I just woke up one morning, read some stuff on this subreddit, and thought, you know what, how about right now? Right now seems good. No last cigarette, no romanticizing or getting nostalgic about smoking, I just cut the cord. And it WORKED. Even if I'd failed, I'd have had at least experienced *actively* avoiding smoking, and that became a huge motivation on its own.

2. **Be nice to your s.o. and warn them about your triggers.** Since my quit attempt seemed so sudden and spontaneous, I didn't talk about it much. After day 3 or 4 of not smoking, I could tell my partner was trying to work up the nerve to ask me if I was trying to quit. I finally told him, yes, this is a quit attempt and if you could pretty please not ask me about how it's going *at all* we can avoid me erupting in post-quit rage at you. It was SUCH a help, and he didn't say a peep until I told him I thought I'd made it past the worst of it a few months later. Hooray, I quit smoking without destroying my relationship!

3. **Be patient with yourself.** Everyone has a different response to quitting, and for most people it's not really pleasant the first few weeks. It's honestly weird to have this habit absent from your daily routine, and that will cause you some anxiety while you're adjusting to it. But just wait! It doesn't take long for most people to start being really acutely aware of that weird anxiety getting less and less intense on an almost daily basis! For me, weeks three through five were when I really felt like I was out of the woods--cravings lasted a few minutes when I started, by week three they lasted maybe a minute, by week five they lasted about 30 seconds, and so on. Once you sense your own progress, you can hold on to that as something to carry you into your non-smoking future. But the first couple weeks it's going to be hard to notice much of anything other than not smoking. Buckle down at the beginning and you'll get there.

4. **You guys, this air.** Are you digging this air? Tastes, smells, textures of food and drinks... I mean, I had no idea. I started smoking as a teen, so all my foodie tastes I've developed since then were so muted by smoking that I just had no idea. It's an awesome reward.

5. **Look forward to the restraint you'll have soon.** I just spent the weekend with a former housemate who still smokes like the chimney I once was. All weekend she was chain smoking everywhere we went. It's been long enough that I didn't even feel a twitch of an urge when she'd light up, something that I *never* thought I'd experience. More than anything, I'm amazed at how little temptation I feel now. When an urge comes up now, it seems to come out of nowhere instead of being triggered by watching someone smoke (which used to give me an INSANE AND UNDENIABLE urge to join them). When they do pop up, they take all of five seconds to dismiss. I even feel like I have a sort-of eye-roll response to them now, like a mental aside in which I make fun of my brain for trying such a dumb trick ("really brain, you think that'll work *now?* weak, get back to work.") Everyone gets to their own level of this, but, wow, it's fantastic to get to a point where I feel control over the habit that I used to feel was keeping me from being miserable.

6. **More than one long-term nagging health issue has resolved.** Surprise, I guess? I used to get regular midday headaches that I now know were related to my smoking. They've been gone since about week three. I also used to require three or more weeks to bounce back from a cold, but the last one I had was more or less resolved after four days. And so on.

7. **Badge, badge, badge.** At my lowest, I'd sign in and look at that little number. I cannot believe how much of my success has been channeled through that little badge, which is now smiling back at me. I want it tattooed on me as a reminder. Get a badge and look at it every day! Talk to the other redditors here every day, even if you don't think it's helping. Be aware of your process, and your progress, and vent whenever possible. This is a *great* place to do it.

I could go on and on and on, and the whole process to this point has been fascinating. I look forward to year two and even more progress.

Thanks all, and happy quitting to each of you.

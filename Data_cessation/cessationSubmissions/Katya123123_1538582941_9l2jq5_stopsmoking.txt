The depression has lifted!

(Touchwood) after weeks of misery, tears and being completely fed up with no energy I feel like myself again. I have energy and am not sad, woo woo! 

Persevere when it gets tough, the lows go! 

Thanks to those of you who have responded when I was in the depression phase, means the world!

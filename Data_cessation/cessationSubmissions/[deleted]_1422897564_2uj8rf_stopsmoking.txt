My problem with quitting

I'm starting attempt nr. 1536789. I don't have a problem while I'm at home. I even got used to handling not smoking while I'm working - though quite often, the only time I can get a break is to say I'm going for a smoke... But I figured out how to handle that part too.

What I'm not handling is not to smoke when I go out. Doesn't matter if I'm just going to the store or to sit down with my friends, somehow I just seem to not be able to last without a cigarette.

Thing is, I have ADD, and a simple thing like walking or even having fun with friends over a beer is really, really boring for me (if it lasts long at least). And smoking was (is?) a way to make a task like transporting myself somewhere less mundane, and to have an excuse to run out when sitting down for a while gets too much. And especially when the beer is involved. Quitting drinking is not really an option - I'm a bartender and I specialize in beers, so quite often I need to go and taste new brews (plus, I enjoy it. Not a vice I'm ashamed of.) But even a small beer is enough to get my brain even more restless and that results in me wanting to go out and smoke. Again.

Anyone else with similar problem? Tips and tricks on how to handle this?

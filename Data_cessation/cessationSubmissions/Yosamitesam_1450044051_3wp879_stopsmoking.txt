I'm done smoking!


I've smoked for 35 years and I cant count the number of times that I have thrown away my pack of cigarettes in a sincere attempt to quit because they make me feel like shit. After a half day I start to feel better and forget all about quitting and I'm back buying another pack.
One of the the many reason I want to quit is I can tell smoking has a big effect on blood circulation in my arms and legs. But, just as much and even more than the physical reasons are the years of torturous thoughts of knowing that I have to quit but not being able to. I am fucking sick of it. No more!
A few weeks ago I read Alan Carrs book and I stopped for 9 days. I had a pretty positive attitude during that time and the cravings were not too bad but my head was in a fog for a few days. But, for some reason on the 9 th day, it got unbearable all the sudden, and I gave in and smoked. Que the torturous thoughts again.
Any way, I just thought I would post something to record how much I hate smoking and how much I want to quit. I've been lurking around here for awhile and you guys have already help me but I hope I can count on your support on that 9 th day or whenever it gets unbearable again.
Thanks

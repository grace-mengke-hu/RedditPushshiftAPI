A Cautionary Tale

So, I had been quit for about 600 days when I started smoking again around new years.   Almost two years, down the drain. 

I used to smoke at least a pack a day, so I figured it would be different this time around and I could just have a couple, once in awhile.   The second pack I bought, I was immediately back up to smoking a whole pack a day, sometimes more.  This has gone on for 3 months now.   

After 3 months, my skin looks terrible, I cough all the time, I feel bad on the inside, I am tired and depressed, anxious 24/7.   

Living as a non-smoker vs a smoker is a night and day experience.  So, I am quitting again starting today.

Do not get overly confident.  You cannot just have one.  Smoking is terrible.

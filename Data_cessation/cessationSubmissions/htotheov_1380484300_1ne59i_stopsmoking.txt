Stopped smoking. I can do this.

Just wanted to say Hi to all of you here. I've been smoking for close to 4 years, and last Tuesday on my way back from University I decided I 'd had enough and decided to quit cold turkey. So far I'm doing alright, didn't go to the bar this weekend to avoid any temptation.

I hope this subreddit can help me stay "clean". 

Much love!

Edit: changed 14 years to 4 years..

I am feeling real down. 8th attempt in two months.

Mom is ill. Dad is taking care of her. I am scheduled for the fourth painful surgery in a year in a separate city from family. Job is hard and intense and I am doing everything I can to not cave into the stress. But I haven't been able to quit ðŸ˜ž

Sorry for the rant. I just wanted to get that off my chest.

Making this sub my homepage

Today I, a 20 year old, able-bodied student, got humiliated in front of my lecture hall for smelling like smoke by my professor. Thus, after perusing this sub, I've become inspired to kick my disgusting, two-pack-a-day addiction. I am currently thirty minutes (yes minutes) smoke free. I know it'll be brutal, but reading y'all's posts has already made this half-hour that much easier. Keep 'em coming, and wish me luck!

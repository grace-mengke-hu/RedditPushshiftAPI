The reality of how bad smoking is was bound to sink in at some point.

Hello, very new here. Last night I received a call from my mum letting me know she has throat cancer, and smoking is likely to be the prognosis. She made me promise her I'd quit immediately, and I plan to. So I thought I might need to come here for support on this journey ahead.
I've never attempted any form of quitting before. But it feels completely necessary as it's a promise to my mum, it will result in me being healthier, and hell, my purse wont feel so empty at the end of each week!

I have been smoking around 7-15 cigarettes a day (depending on stress or boredom levels..) So any advice would be really helpful.

Looking forward to the journey ahead with  you guys!

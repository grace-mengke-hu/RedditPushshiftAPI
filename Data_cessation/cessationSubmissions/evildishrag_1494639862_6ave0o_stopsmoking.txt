One Week - Cold Turkey

I've smoked a pack and a half for 25 years. I made a few half-assed attempts at quitting, but never made it more than a day or two. I quit for the last time a week ago -

Day 1 was pretty rough - I got really pissed off about some nonsense and I drove to the store to get a pack of smokes. But when I got to the store I just kept driving. I ended up driving to four different   convenience stores before finally turning around and going back home. At the last store, I stood in the parking lot for what felt like 10 or 15 minutes before getting back in the car to leave. But I didn't buy any cigarettes and I didn't smoke. 

Day 3 was my first day back at work. I decided to keep my usual schedule and take my smoke breaks like always. But instead of sucking down nastiness, I got some fresh air and read this subreddit to boost my willpower. 

The cravings eased up by day 5 - I stopped at a dollar store on the way home from work and noticed all the cigarettes behind the counter when I was checking out. I hadn't even thought about smoking until then. But when I saw them, I just thought to myself "I'm glad I don't need to get those anymore". 

I still haven't told anyone that I've quit. And since I am pretty much still taking my (newly smoke-free) smoke breaks, I don't think anyone at work has any idea. I'm really nervous about telling anyone in case I fall off the wagon. I've still got that voice in my head telling me that I'm still a smoker - I can go buy a pack and it will be just like this week never happened. 

Reading this sub has helped more than anything - just reading everyone's thoughts and stories - and knowing that someone else is going through the same shiat. It helped me so much, I figured I ought to stop lurking and post my experience so far.

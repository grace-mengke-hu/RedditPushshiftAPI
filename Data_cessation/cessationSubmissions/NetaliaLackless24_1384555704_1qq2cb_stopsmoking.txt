My employer is financially forcing me to quit. 2 weeks til D-Day.

My work is going to make my health insurance cost 250.00 instead of 60.00 a month. 

I've been meaning to quit for a while now, but now it's financially impossible for me to maintain the habit.

I was going to by a vap pen but apparently that's still smoking in their eyes. 

I'm a pack and a half a day smoker. I'm going to read through everything here to prepare myself, but thought I'd make a post now for... I don't know, ANYTHING you guys feel like would help me go through this transition.

Thank you all in advance.

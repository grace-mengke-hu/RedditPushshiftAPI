This is my first post

I’m actually scared and nervous I won’t be able to do this, quitting smoking. I’m joining the military and I have to drop weight for it, a pretty significant amount too, and I know smoking is hindering my progress. I want this so badly but I don’t even know how to address the symptoms of quitting. I just started a new job and I don’t want the grumps getting to me. I can’t really afford any sort of nicotine patches, etc. *i pack my own cigs, significantly cheaper than a box of patches—for real* I keep having days where I sit there, in my head, counting as if I’m a child about to rip off a band-aid that’s been there for weeks. I know it’s going to be hard. I know it’s going to be painful. I JUST NEED TO DO THIS. Ah!! I needed to just get this out, what I’m afraid of. And I just found this group so I think you guys will help too. Any words of encouragement or tips are extremely welcome. Thanks for letting me vent. ❤️

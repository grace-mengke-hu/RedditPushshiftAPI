Week 1 - Complete

 Last smoke on 4/2 @ 8 PM. 

First 3 days suck - each worse than the last.  Emotional / Depressed / Anxitious / Low Energy / Desire to smoke and forget about quit... 
I didn't really have an issue over eating. In fact I would say I had little interest in eating. Downside I did eat crap for this week. 

4 day nothing special but no worse. Bad news only slightly better each day but still only slightly better. No real cravings to smoke. 
Went out for a walk last two days. It did help a little lift my spirits. Probably should have done that earlier. 

Drank a few drinks on Friday and Saturday. I didn't really think of smoking - so ill count that as a win. 

Goal for the week a morning walk to take this up a notch. 
  
I wonder if a little planning (Wellbutrin or Vape) and a couple of weeks could have made the transition easier for me. BUT I think could turkey might have benefit. Too late for me for this advice. BUT if you are thinking of Cold Turkey make sure it isn't going to be when you need to work or study. Goal should be to make it until day 5 and see what happens. Also I think working out or even walking might have a bigger benefit than I thought. Although I could barely get out of bed. 
 
Good luck to all and lets see if we can keep this thing moving forward.

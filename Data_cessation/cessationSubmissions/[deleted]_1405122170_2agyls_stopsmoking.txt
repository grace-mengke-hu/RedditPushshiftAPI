Help me understand cigarette addiction?

Hello people. I am not trying to be ignorant, mean, or any of that. Please explain how you can be addicted to something that is SO bad for you. It costs a shitton of money, it fucks up your health, you annoy non-smokers. Understanding the addiction is the first step I need to take to encourage others to stop.

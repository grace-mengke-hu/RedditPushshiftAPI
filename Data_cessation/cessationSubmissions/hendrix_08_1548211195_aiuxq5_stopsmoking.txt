When our body speaks, we must act!

Our body is the greatest doctor – the one who doesn't lie, the one who always knows what's best for us.

I can't take it anymore – I'm coughing, I can't breathe, I'm anxious for the next hit of nicotine, I'm exhausted all the time, I'm depressed. And these are all ways in which my body is telling me to stop smoking! Why should I wait to get a diagnose from a medic so I can stop smoking? It's absurd. I'm already sick. And after more relapses than I can count, I finally commit to being a healthy nonsmoker. 

Thank you for your inspirational stories, StopSmoking!

ps. If you think that our brains don't do the best for us, you're wrong. The problem is that tobacco companies (besides other industries) know how to trick it, so they can profit as much as they can from our survival mechanisms. This is so inhumane,  disgusting, obscene. Fuck them!

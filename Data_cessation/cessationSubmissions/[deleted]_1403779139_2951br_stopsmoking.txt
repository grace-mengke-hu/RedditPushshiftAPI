Day 1 - Post 1 - Balancedhighs

I had my last cigarette this morning. I've got some patches and I've got some gum and I'm on my way. I'm going to avoid using e-cigarettes, last time I tried to quit, I went a good a week without smoking, but the moment I ran out of cartridges I was straight to the shop and bought a pack of tobacco. I need to break the habbit.

This may not be a popular topic in this sub. But I also smoke cannabis. I used to smoke this with tobacco in the form of a joint, but I've got a bong and I fully intend on using it.

The main reason why I'm quitting is because I actively enjoy sports, but I've woken up this morning after a game of football/soccer yesterday and my chest feels awful. I can't keep this up.

I've previously read the Alan Carr book and that didn't help. Despite what he says, whether it's a placebo or the actual effect of nicotine, I do enjoy the act of smoking, I feel more relaxed when I smoke, even if it's just for a moment, but the side effects (especially this morning) are filling me with a morbid fear about my health.

I need to do this. I want a long and healthly life!

I'd really appreciate your support and advice in anyway possible. Especially on the subject of quitting tobacco but continuing cannabis use and also whether e-cigs can help me.

I'm probably going to be doing a lot of updates. Sometimes just to vent. So apologies in advance!

It has been a month...

And I haven't had much troubles!  I used nicotine gum for the first week but I haven't even touched em in a few weeks.  My cravings have died down significantly and only occur at most once a day.  They're minor cravings now.

My biggest hurdle is that I catch myself trying to justify smoking.  Something like "it wouldn't be the end of the world if I just had one" but I quickly realize what I'm doing and stop.

But yeah, so far so good.  I was smoking around a pack a day, probably more, and was a smoker for 6 years.

For those wondering, the nicotine gum did help with the major cravings.  I had a peice to relieve cravings and not just to supplement my smoking habit.

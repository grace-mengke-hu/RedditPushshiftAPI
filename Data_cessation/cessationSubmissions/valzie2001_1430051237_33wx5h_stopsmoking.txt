Day 11!! You wouldn't think that number would mean so much!!

I'm Day 11 smoke free!! I am feeling great this morning, sleep has gotten better, not great but it s better then it has been. The other night I had a dream it was awful, smokes would just turn up in my hand, I would start smoking and then realize I was quitting and throw the cigarette down and I would take a few steps and another one would just appear in my hand, it was awful, a really cruel dream!!!

My mood is better today, had a few days of crap moods. Was angry at the world for nothing at all!! Then going to work on Friday I walked right by my co worker that was smoking, damn I knew it was going to happen sooner or later, but I did good I just kept right on walking right into the building didn't look back at all!!

I feel so much better, am so proud of me for making it this far, and hoping all the up coming pre surgical appointments like my dentist appointment (that I hate going to) tomorrow that is a 2 hour procedure doesn't set me back to square one!!!!!

Hoping to stay strong!!!

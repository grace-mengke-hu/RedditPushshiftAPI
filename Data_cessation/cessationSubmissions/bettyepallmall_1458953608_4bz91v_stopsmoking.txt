I would read posts here and be so envious!

All of the "I feel so much better" and the "Totally worth it" mixed with the "Best decision I ever made" posts and comments used to make me so envious of those posting it. But now I can post it! I do indeed feel so much better, and it is totally worth it. 

And you guessed it....best decision I ever made!

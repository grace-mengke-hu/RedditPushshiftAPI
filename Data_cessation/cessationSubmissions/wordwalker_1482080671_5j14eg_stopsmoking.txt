Considering quitting. I have one major hold up though.

so I've started getting a lot more into health and fitness recently 9september time). My smoking has actually decreased anyway, and I'm thinking that I might as well quit.

The toughest thing I think for me will be if I am at a bar/club. It's not so much the compulsion to smoke that makes me go outside, but I don''t like staying in one place dancing or whatever. I get a bit overloaded.

I'm imagining that quitting smoking gives me less of a reason to disappear outside, which I know is stupid but I can't seem to console it with the idea of quitting. have any of you had similar experiences?

Second day, no smoking - Crazy B**** Cravings

I have to say, despite being incredibly proud that I haven't had a cigarette, I really want a cigarette.


I have been fine all day, right up until about 1500, and then I turned into this mega bitch from hell. I was snappy with my colleagues and everything was irritating me, from the phone ringing to the way my sleeves aren't tight enough to how my feet are a bit sweaty and squeak in my flip flops. Every little thing made me so angry I was honestly scared I'd turn green.


I know that this is pretty standard, and I know it isn't the first time it'll happen. I just wish I was a slightly less angry person, then maybe I wouldn't be quite so insane.


I will be buying some nicorette gum after work, to help with the Crazy Bitch Cravings. I did buy some tablet things that dissolve under your tongue, but they made me violently sick. They're awful, awful, awful!


I hope y'all are doing well on your non-smoking journey! Stay strong you beauties!


Ciao!

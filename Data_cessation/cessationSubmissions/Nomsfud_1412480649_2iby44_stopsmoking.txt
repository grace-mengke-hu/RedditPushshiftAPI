Seven days in the books

I've quit before and posted on this sub, but I've never been able to stick with it. I liked to blame it on my friends not quitting with me, but I'm gonna be honest with myself and admit that before I wasn't ready to quit. 

Now I am though. I started a week ago with nicotine patches, and they definitely helped the first couple of days. The problem I had with them though was the fact that they kept falling off when I was at work. After about two days I cut my losses and went cold turkey. 

The first couple of days going through that were hell. The patches had helped take away my need to smoke, but when I stopped using them the craving for nicotine was still there. It's gone for the most part now though. 

Here's hoping I can stay strong this time. Fingers crossed!

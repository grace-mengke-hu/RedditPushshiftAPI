I'm terrified.

On Saturday, I woke up with this strange ulcer/sore on my lower gumline. I waited for it to go away (as I do with most physical mysteries that arise on my body), only it hasn't. So of course, I did what any logical person would do...I diagnosed myself via Google.

I came across a website with pictures of different mouth ailments, along with the name of the particular ailment. The picture that most closely resembled MY condition was connected to "oral cancer." 

You know how they say "a wave of panic rushed over me?" That's what I felt, like pure terror. I did make an appointment with my dentist tomorrow, but I'm still terrified. Fortunately I read that oral cancer is super easy to treat if caught early. And then again, I'm putting the cart before the horse (it might be nothing). 

The worst part about this is knowing (if it is cancer, that is) that I most likely did this to myself by smoking so much for so long. It's one thing if God/nature decides it's time for you to go, but to do it to yourself is mind boggling. 

Anyways, don't ever diagnose yourself over the web. If you think something's wrong, just call your doctor.

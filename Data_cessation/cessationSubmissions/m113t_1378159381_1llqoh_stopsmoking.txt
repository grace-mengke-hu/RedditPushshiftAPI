Thank you Allen Carr

I was a once a heavy pack a day (20's) smoker, living in New Zealand where each packet costs around $13.90 (cheapest). 

I read Allen Carrs book for $7.29 on my Kindle in 2 days, and am never going to look back. 

I'm free from this weed, and encourage everyone out there who is struggling with stopping to read Allen Carr's EASYWAY book. It honestly works. You've got to believe in yourself and in the book.

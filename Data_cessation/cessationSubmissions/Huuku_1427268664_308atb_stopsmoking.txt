Today marks 2 years

Two years ago I made perhaps the best decision in my life and I'm here to brag about it and also to once again thank you for the great and supportive community that you all are. Never before have I thought that I would love the question "Do you smoke?" so much now that I can honestly say "No, I quit them."  
  
For all of you who are just starting now, keep in mind that it gets easier with time and not only easier but a lot more fun. And when you do it, please don't let this stay a sole achievement. Prove to yourself that you are a strong person and start living a generally healthy life. It's worth it :)

smoking shisha from time to time -> ok for quitters?

Hi,

do you think smoking shisha is a problem if you quit smoking cigaretts?
I am really quitting for good, but now I start to  daydream sometimes about smoking shisha. LotÂ´s of my friends smoke shisha sometimes and many of them are non-smokers. 

Does somebody here who quit smoking, sometimes smoke shisha? And how do you deal with it?

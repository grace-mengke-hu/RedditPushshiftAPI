Soon

First time here, thought maybe talking about might help me, who knows? I have 9 days left on the clock before quitting. Been smoking for about 12 years, 3/4 pack a day.I work a high stress job at times and I am terrified of having a bad day causing me to relapse, still not sure how I am going to handle that yet. I am also worried for everyone and everything in my external environment due too how angry I get, again not sure how to handle that either. Really looking forward to quitting for good since I usually crash and burn around 6 weeks. 
I will be back to share some more here in a few days, thank you to those who listen/read.

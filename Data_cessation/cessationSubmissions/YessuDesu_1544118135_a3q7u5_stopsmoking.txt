How can I help my closest friend stop smoking?

I'd like to add that she sort of wants to stop as she's told me this explicitly. 
We're college students, and at the beginning of the semester, she started blowing through cigarettes to cope with stress, ironically. She's an amazing tennis player, and the game means so much to her. I've grown up around smokers in my extended family, and I see what it can do to people. She knows what it can do to her, but her addiction makes it difficult for her to stop. She sometimes says she has control over this addiction but she doesn't. How can I help? How can she get help?

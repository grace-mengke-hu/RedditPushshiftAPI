90 Days Free - Checking In!

Just hit 90 days without any nicotine! Life has thrown me a bunch of curve balls lately (finances, hospital visits, evictions, and a few others I won't go into detail with, here). I'd be lying to you if I said I never felt like lighting up after each obstacle, but I didn't and I couldn't be prouder. This sub has helped a lot with that. Looking forward to my next check in at 180 days! Cheers!

Seeking some advice/feedbacks

Hello everyone!  I am newbie here...Reason I am here is because I have been trying to help my dad to quit smoking, and also trying to convince him to join a community like this which could help him get through it.  Anyone of you have any advice or even tips on quit smoking?  (FYI, my dad smokes everyday, and he is a social drinker.)

Meanwhile, I recently just found out from my colleague that there is nicotine toothpicks called Zippix that my colleague has been using at work. Not sure has anyone here tried it? I tried one of his (I am not a smoker/tobacco user), the flavor he got was Mocha ( or Dark chocolate, can't remember the name), and taste pretty good actually, but at the same time it has a little bit minty flavor taste (I am not sure if it is nicotine or what since I don't smoke, so I have no idea what nicotine suppose to taste like), it did give me some kinda excitatory stimulation (especially it was during afternoon), I was wide awake after having that toothpick in my mouth ( around 30 mins, because that mocha flavor last fairly long).

But the thing is, I am non-smoker, even it works for me (I guess that the nicotine was working in my body, not sure if its good or bad thing...) but I am not sure that nicotine toothpick would work on smokers like my dad. So I wonder has anyone tried it, if so, does it work?

Did anyone get squirrely around their 4 month mark (or later)?

I've been fairly craving free after my initial 60 days, but I've recently been having the craving for the ashy taste of cigarettes.


Not the *good taste* but literally the *ashy* smell. I can almost taste it in my tongue sometimes. 


I figured this might be because my downstairs neighbors have been smoking in their apartment which stinks up the entire building, but they were smoking a month ago and I had very low cravings.


Nothing I can't withstand, **just curious to see if there are going to be any other weird cravings I can look forward to experiencing** ;-)

This subreddit helped inspire me to quit. Day 7 and I haven't felt this good in a long time.

This is the longest I have gone without nicotine since I had that first smoke almost 8 years ago. I had been at a pack or more a day for around 5 years, but I quit so I could start running and get back to the shape I was in during high school. Day 3 was probably the worst day for me, and I am surprised at how much easier it got after I made it through that day. I can honestly say I didn't have a single craving today. That amazes me. I can breathe so much easier already and I can actually run without feeling like I'm going to have a heart attack. I am never going back to being a smoker; I just feel too good now! Knowing that I can quit smoking has inspired me to better myself even further, starting with getting in shape, and I will be running my first 5k in two months. To everybody who has just started quitting or the people who haven't decided if they want to yet: you can do it, keep at it and don't lose hope. Remember why you are quitting. Thank you all and I'm sorry about shitty formatting and grammar. I typed this all on my phone.

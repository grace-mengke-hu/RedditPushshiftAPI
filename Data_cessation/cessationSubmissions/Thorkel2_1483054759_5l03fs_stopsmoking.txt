It begins . . . anxiety, brainfog and lethargy

I’m posting this on both r/stopsmoking and r/stopdrinking, because I’m not even sure which addiction is causing this. 

So, I was wondering when I was going to have to make this post. Turns out it’s day 5. Sounds about right. This point always comes. It’s come every 5-7 days for the past two months. I’ve even made a new Reddit account out of sheer embarrassment over having to start over so many times. 

Anyway, it’s happening again . . . the drowsiness, the teeth-grinding, the brain fog, the anxiety, the inability to complete tasks and the anxiety THAT causes . . . For the past three days I’ve done a good job of going to the gym and AA every day, getting things done and overall feeling pretty good. Yesterday I went to the gym, yoga and AA, and I loved the feeling of accomplishment from that. 

But now, all I feel like doing is laying on my bed and playing computer games, watching movies, ordering food on GrubHub . . . if I feel like being REALLY productive I might do some light cleaning or organize my files. But that’s about all that’s getting done today. My favorite Thursday AA meeting is in 45 minutes, but I don’t think I’m going to go (there’s another one later in the evening if I change my mind). I was hoping to go to a yoga class, too, but that probably won’t happen either.

I HATE this feeling. And the drowsiness and feeling like I have my head in a vise aren’t even the worst parts of it. The worst part is the anxiety and the feeling that I’m being lazy, like I’m just making excuses not to do these things I know are good for me. I’m prone to anxiety, depression, self-loathing, and I’m something of a workaholic, so giving myself a break for a few days isn’t something that comes naturally to me. 

I don’t even know what I’m asking for with this post. I guess just some camaraderie at the beginning of this very frustrating transition would be nice. Thanks for reading.

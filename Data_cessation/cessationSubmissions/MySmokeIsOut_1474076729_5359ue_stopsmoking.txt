Help 9 hours I'm freaking out

I'm 3 years sober from cocaine and pain pills. I justify my 2 packs a day with that. I haven't had a smoke since I got to work, this dang nic gum is giving me serious lock jaw from tmj.. I really need to quit. It's our anniversary and I don't want to let my fianc√© down.. How did ya'll do it? I'm going nuts...

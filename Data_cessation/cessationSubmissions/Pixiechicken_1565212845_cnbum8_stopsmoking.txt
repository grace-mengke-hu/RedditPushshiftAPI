Blood pressure is now NORMAL!!! ðŸŽ‰

Been chewing A LOT of nicotine gum for many, many years. Suddenly doc said my BP was elevated enough to warrant medication. Fuck! Figured I'd try no nicotine gum just to see IF it helps because I do workout and eat right. In 30 hrs, my BP is normal!!!!! DAYUM!!!

Alright, here we go. Resources and/or suggestions for cold turkey?

I have lozenges as backup but other than that I want to minimise the withdrawals so will be using those as a last resort. Any tips on things that help with the cravings and physical uncomfortability? I've heard that sunflower seeds and menthol can help?

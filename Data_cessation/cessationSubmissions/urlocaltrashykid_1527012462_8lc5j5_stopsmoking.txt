Relapsed today but I'm not giving up!

This is not my first time quitting and I've noticed that (I know it'll sound weird and illogical) setting a clear goal of how I'm going to quit just makes it harder. I tend to be a perfectionist and that makes the relapses so much worse than they really are. 

Truth is, relapses will happen and if I set a clear goal of quitting cold turkey I will most likely fail. On the other hand, if I tell myself I'll gradually decrease the amount of cigarettes until I've completely stopped, I know I won't.

We should stop seeing relapses as something huge and terrible. They do happen. They don't  mean s**t. You had the willpower to stop smoking and THAT is huge. That's brave. We should start concentrating on the good things more. Sure, a relapse isn't something good, but why don't we look at all the days we managed to stay smoke free, give ourselves some credit, thank ourselves and tell ourselves how strong we are? We can do this.

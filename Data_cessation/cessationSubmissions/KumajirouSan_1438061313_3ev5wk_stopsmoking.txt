I smoked a joint with tobacco in it today. Should i be worried?

So 3 weeks ago today i quit smoking tobacco. I've been going great, and I'm  really proud of my self control, but today my friend offered me a joint.


I'm not sure how you guys feel about marijuana but I like to occasionally endulge so i accepted, but little did i know it was mixed with tobacco. I mean... I got a bit of a headspin from it but it didnt feel too strong, and i certainly dont feel like ive just had a cigarette. (In fact, i think it made me crave one right after)


My question is, should i prepare for another 3 weeks of cravings or should i be fine having only had a little bit?

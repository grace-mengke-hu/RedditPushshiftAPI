Almost One Month!

Sooo excited to say I've just about hit the one month mark. Thank to everyone on here! It's been a great support system.

I feel like I've attempted quitting so many times that I don't get much support from those around me, other than a "Like". That said, this time around I feel much more SELF motivated. :)

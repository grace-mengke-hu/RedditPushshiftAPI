How bad will it be? (Vaping)

I got a Juul a week ago and had been hitting my friends' every other day or so for a while before, but didn't have problems with cravings. I've been feeling nauseous and anxious ever since I got the thing, and I wanna throw it out the window. How bad will this be? I only went through 1 and a half pods in a week. I don't really know how this works, but I'm going on vacation in a few days and I don't want to be tweaking out the whole time. Anyone have an idea of what I can expect/advice on how to handle it?

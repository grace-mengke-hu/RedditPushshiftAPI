Bump in the road

I quit smoking last Friday for no other reason than I wanted to quit. I have been smoking for 16 years and have quit a few times. I for 3 months, 4 months, 8 months, and my longest time quitting was for a year. I was drinking with a friend last night and had 2 smokes with him while we were visiting. I regretted it as soon as he left. I want to quit for good this time. Is there any advice anyone can offer me?

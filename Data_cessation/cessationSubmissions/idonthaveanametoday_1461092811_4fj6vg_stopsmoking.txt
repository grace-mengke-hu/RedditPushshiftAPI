Severe Bloat anyone

Hello,

I've quit many times before but this time hopefully it will be my last. I'm in about a month now. Any still have crazy bloat. I do all the normal things ( good diet, exercise, sleep, ginger, lemon, avoid bloating foods etc) it seems to be only smoking cessation related. Anyone experience this?

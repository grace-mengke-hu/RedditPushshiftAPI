Okay, I really need some insight into my tiny problem

So I decided to quit I was fine, its been a month, I don't crave it almost at all anymore.. You know the gist. 

Only problem is.. I'm struggling with anxiety and panic attacks in the past week. I don't know what it is, because my life is really not so stressful at the moment - okay I've been looking for a job for 2-3 months now - but I mean my parents are supportive, I've got where to live, I've got money to spend so despite that I can't get what I want, I can't say I'm desperate either.

My love life is perfect, we love each other, we're on the same wavelength, I'm struggling a little with weight loss, but even that has been going on well for me lately. 

And still, I have anxiety and panic attacks almost every evening lately. And none very well founded, like what if I have lung cancer (I'm 26, with no coughing problems, no wheezing, no spitting out blood) or diabetes (I haven't touched sweets in a month) so diseases that cross my mind with no logical explanation whatsoever. But they get in my head so deep that I've actually spent all week investigating myself and finding out everything is excellent. But even so.. every time I get some test results back, my brain finds something else to worry about. I don't know what to do anymore. And could it be related to quitting smoking? I've never had this issue before..

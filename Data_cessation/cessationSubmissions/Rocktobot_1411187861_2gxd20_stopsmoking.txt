How do i fill the hole?

So i am 28 years old, i was a smoker for 12 years. I quit on the 10th of this month, so im about 10 days in and i have no intention of returning. However, this has been the hardest thing i've had to do and im having some issues. The cravings i can more or less deal with, i drink tons of water and now have a sunflower seed addiction, but im ok with both of those. I now have a habbit void that i dont know how to fill. My girlfriend (we're quitting together) pus it this way, and i totally agree. Cigarettes, (excluding whatever else they were) were like a treat. If you have a great meal, treat yourself to a smoke. Had great sex? Smoke treat, accomplish a task? Treat.  etc...now i dont have that, how do i fill this void? I love the idea of being able to take a break from something / accomplish something, and have that treat for myself. Another thing is i liked to have a couple beers on my porch alone and have a smoke or two, now what do i do with my beer? What do i do after sex? I want that treat, but i by no means want it to be a cigarette. Sorry for the lengthy explanation, need to vent a bit lol.

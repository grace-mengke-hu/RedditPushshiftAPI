Four days in, and feeling wobbly.

Hi to all. So happy I found this! Been smoking for 20 years- I have had some non-smoking, but mostly a devoted nicadict. I haven't been brave enough for cold turkey in a while, and totally forgot how much it sucks... BUT, today I feel better than yesterday, and yesterday I felt better than the day before.

Looking back (1 year)

Exactly one year ago I wrote this [little piece of drama](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/29fyld/but_then_again_personal_rant/) on this subreddit.   
 
 
It all seems a little cringe-worthy now, but at the time it felt incredibly overwhelming (cold turkey, watched Easy Way video, did not read book).   
 
 
Summary of 365 days without smoking: It gets better, a lot better. It's like when you first start running and you look at your stopwatch every 10 seconds to see when you can stop. After a while, you don't need to look at the watch anymore.  
 
  I don't miss it, cravings are rare and weak, they disappear as soon as they show up. I will never be the person I was before I started; trying to kick an addiction can show you some demons you never thought you had.   
 
 
**TL;DR Do it. It's worth it. It really is. Thank you for all the help.**

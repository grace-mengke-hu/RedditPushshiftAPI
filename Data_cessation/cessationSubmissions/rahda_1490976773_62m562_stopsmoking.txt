Cravings rant...

I have examined smoking from the addictive components, the chemistry, the behavioral, etc. I just want to know why the fuck do cravings happen for hours, or even the better part of a day. YES it is easier, and NO I don't want to smoke anymore but my brain STILL wants to figure out how to smoke. It is very tiring when this happens. I do lots of things that help, but sometimes it is very uncomfortable. I have quit before for years at a time and NEVER had such a difficult time. This is of course MUCH better at a month than I was those first days and weeks. Its just annoying as fuck. I know this will still get better, but I can see now why quitting can be very difficult to do! Sometimes my brain almost convinces me to want to light up or it just fixates on smoking to delirious extents. ugh. Been doing it on and off all morning. Back to obsessively researching smoking cessation, eating carrot sticks, deep breathing, meditation, etc.

23 days ago I took lsd. 23 days ago I smoked my last cigarette as a daily smoker.

I was sitting on this empty field with my friend and lit up a cigarette as I used to. Then I closed my eyes and saw all the smoke go inside my lungs and rape the shit out of them. This was all I needed to see. I took the last pack I could afford that month and destroyed it. Even after 3 weeks I can see how much better my lungs have gotten even in such a short amount of time. I do feel like im going to smoke in the future since I have always enjoyed the act of smoking more than I have been addicted to nicotine. All i can do is hope that il never become a slave of the smoke as I was.
NOTE: I'm not trying to encourage anyone to try lsd or other psychedelics.

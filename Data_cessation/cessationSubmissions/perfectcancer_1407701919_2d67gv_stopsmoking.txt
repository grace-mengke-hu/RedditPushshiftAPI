dun goofed

okay so I haven't been on this subreddit in a while, I quit for like 3 weeks, then gave in and refused to associate with anything quitting wise due to shame I suppose. I am going to smoke my last cigarette tonight, and I need to change my badge. I don't why I'm posting, but I'm sure many of you don't. Cannot wait to be able to breathe

Does smoking change your personality?

Before I smoked, I was generally a patient, easy-going guy who everyone called “nice.”  I started smoking, and little by little, I got edgier, a bit angrier, less patient, and irritable. This is over a decade. Could cigarettes have caused this?  Can anyone relate to this?  Don’t you think smokers are more like this than non-smokers?

I don’t want to make excuses for myself or create false causation theories, but I think there’s something to this.  Opinions and personal experiences welcome.

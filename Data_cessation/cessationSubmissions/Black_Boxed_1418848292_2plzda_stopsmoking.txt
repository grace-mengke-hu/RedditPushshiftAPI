Nicotine Nightmares

This is my first post, and I feel weird but a friend pointed me in this direction.

I quit smoking almost two months ago. I wasn't a heavy smoker: one after each meal, maybe an extra 1 or 2 when I went out for drinks. I did quit cold turkey but I have tried other methods. One day I finally just threw my empty box down in anger and frustration and declared I was officially a non-smoker (which resulted in me pouting like a snotty child for the rest of the afternoon).

I'm still stubborn in the fact that I didn't entirely want to quit in the first place and I openly bitch about how much I miss smoking (though strangely not nicotine, more the oral fixation), but I'm also too stubborn to pick it back up because I want to prove that I made the right choice by quitting the way I did.

Recently, I've been having dreams about smoking. Sometimes, I'll smoke no problem in these dreams, but other times I'll be sneaking around in my dreams guiltily. As a result, I wake up sometimes really disturbed, stressed, and sometimes I'm crying. I'm just getting through the mopey bit of quitting and starting to feel better, so I'm not sure how to avoid getting these dreams which are making me anxious and somewhat depressed.

I hope this wasn't too long of a post, and I'd love to know if anyone else has had a similar experience.

Getting easier and easier each day!

My whole life I've been around smoke, I started smoking when I was 12.   
I've tried to quit countless times.   
Each previous attempt started out with good intentions and went relatively well, until the moment the pack was almost empty - then I would fall apart from the anxiety and go right back to smoking, *chain-smoking* even.   
Other peoples advice never helped, pictures of cancer don't scare me - smoking or not smoking, the chances of me dying from cancer are huge due to my immunological disorder. And bring on the downvotes, but Allen Carr's video/book literally did fuck-all for me. 
    
This time started out the same, but very quickly became much different.   
On the first day I actually *left the house without my pack *(never attempted this before!), I felt okay until I met up with my father (who has smoked so much, for so long, his teeth are worse than horrendous) and the anxiety came flooding back.    
Actually it wasn't a flood, it was an anxiety tsunami, and I caved - cue the chain smoking!    
    
That night I re-prioritized and changed my quit date on here & my app, and did a bit of [reading on addiction](http://whyquit.com/ffn.pdf) thanks to a link in one of /u/my_vape_self 's comments (I cannot thank you enough for posting this, you've actually changed my life).    
I also bought an electronic cigarette, with *nicotine-free* liquid, to essentially 'mimic' smoking to trick my brain and give my hands something to do.    
Once the chemical dependency is gone, I'll begin weening myself off the pen, which I think will be fairly easy.     
I've been nicotine free for three days, I have no anxiety at all, and I have never been this confident in my quit before.   
*This feels amazing.*    
     
Just wanted to share my happiness and wish you all a good day, I hope you're doing well!

Smoking in the morning..

Hello redditors who try to quit this bad habit.

I started quitting recently but it seems I can't quit one habit.
Every morning I feel ths urge to smoke just one cigarette along with my coffee,but for the rest of the day it is relatively ok to resist the temptation.my question is,is it ok to just have one in the morning along with the coffee? 
It's just that I really enjoy those two combined I think.

Kind of a unique situation not sure how to handle the quitting process going forward.

My nicotine addiction started with vaping but I also smoked occasionally mostly when drinking or using drugs because vaping always gave me anxiety when doing it on that.

Anyway I was vaping 10-15ml of 6mg nicotine which is the equivalent of 3-5 packs of cigarettes a day.

A week ago I started to cut back on vaping and had horrible anxiety. So I switched to smoking exclusively. So I went from 3-5 packs a day of nicotine vape to a pack a day of smoking. This past week has been hell with the worst anxiety of my life and a constant headache. I also haven't slept much at all.

I haven't really had any cravings probably because my lungs aren't used to cigarettes. Anyway I just woke up after two hours of sleep dropping sweat dreaming about cigarettes in a panic attack.

I feel like I have two choices from here. Maintain a pack a day habit until the withdrawal subsides and then get on the nicotine patch or just get on the nicotine patch once I wake up tommorrow.

My worry is anxiety. I'm not sure I could handle any harsher withdrawal symptoms.

OTOH I'm worried that I'm getting addicted to something more addictive then just vaping.

I've never had cravings from vaping. But I've also done nothing but increase my usage until I was vaping 4 packs a day worth of nicotine.

Any advice?

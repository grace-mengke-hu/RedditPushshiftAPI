Something has to give

I am not one to bemoan my life, woe is me, everything is awful. But fuck if I don't learn some god damn healthy coping skills, I am going to lose my shit in a week. It took every ounce of effort I had today to not buy a pack on my way home. I even took a different route because I wasn't sure if the gas stations along it would have my kind. I am smoking a bowl tonight so I cannot leave my house (can't drive on weed) to buy a pack. I curse you, Universe, for dealing me this fucktwaddle of a hand of cards and I fart in your general direction as I play it with outward grace and inward torment. Eat shit and die in a hole.

Yup, a lot of times I come here to write extremely explicit posts to vent and then I'm better. Today is one of those times. Not the better part just yet, but I'm proud of this one.

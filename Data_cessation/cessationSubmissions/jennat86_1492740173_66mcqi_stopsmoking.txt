What's your silliest/ most obscure reason?

Tl;Dr I want to be a white haired lady who reads to kids as a community service/ hobby.


I'm actively smoking, and tonight when reading to my youngest daughter I was feeling out of breath, my throat sore and voice raspy from 15 years of smoking. 

 Reading to my kids has been one of my greatest joys in parenting and I have always thought I would someday be the old lady reading to kids at the library with all the energy and enthusiasm of my youth. 

  At this rate if I live to a ripe old age I'm at higher odds of dementia, stroke, copd, or any other number of illnesses. Pretty sure reading Dr Suess through a voice box isn't quite the same either.

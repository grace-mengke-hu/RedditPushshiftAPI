A year and a day!(Hello from the other side)

This is my second time being here, so I'm not breaking any new ground, but it does feel good! I can't remember last time I had a craving and I don't get the dreams anymore. Thank you to this community for being a big part of me staying away from cigarettes. I love hearing your stories from all over the world. We are all one big family, and I love all of you. Keep up the good work!

Almost(Or Did I) fell off the wagon

First time in a month that I have been bored and not had any company and the pangs of Just One returned..I fought off the cravings for a very long time and finally caved in and bought a pack justifying that one will not hurt.

I told my self that If I do smoke one I will do it Mindfully, carefully feeling the way it tastes. I lit one (Yes, I went that far), took a few puffs and may be around the 3rd or 4th puff I realized that it tasted HORRIBLE and there was no point in smoking. Go out pay money, stay outside in the cold and endure the stench and bad taste.. NOT WORTH IT. Snubbed it then and there, thrashed the reminder and in one way I am happy that I did it.

I NO longer have the craving to go back to smoking! Whew..:-)

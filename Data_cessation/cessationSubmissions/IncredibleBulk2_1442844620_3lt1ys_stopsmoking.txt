Quitting for myself, and no one else.

I have been smoking on and off since age 18. Peaks and fallows in daily use can be attributed to who I was dating and friends I was spending time with, with high correlations to stress and European travel, as well.

My mother was a closet smoker (and apparently her mother too) for as long as I've known them. My grandmother is, miraculously, in good heath for an 85 y/o who had six children and has 20+ grand children and great grandchildren. My mother is on steroids for her breathing and sometimes cannot walk or get out of bed because she cannot breath, despite having a powerful career. I've had to watch her suffer the consequences of smoking my whole adult life, and I still do it. Even though I, like her, have asthma. 

I'm starting to have trouble breathing. I have been wheezing for a solid 3 weeks now, despite a round of prednisone. My depression and anxiety are as bad as they have ever been, mostly related to stress from my relationship and job. I love cigarettes. But I can't keep smoking.

As a side-note to an already long post, my long-term SO hates my smoking. He distances himself from me when I do it in public, withholds affection, etc. I can't quit just because he doesn't like it. His behavior just makes me want to smoke more out of spite. Therapy makes me want to chain smoke.

So I want to be clear. I am quitting for me, and only me. I owe this to no one but myself. Smoking causes harm to me and I love me. Seriously, I'm pretty awesome. I don't want to be sick or short of breath, or make an audible racket when I take a deep breath. I want to be able to smell the trees and the flowers and to taste everything I eat. I want my skin to retain whatever youth it has left. Not for anyone else, but because I deserve love and respect and health and happiness, so I should start treating myself that way.

Cheers r/stopsmoking, I quit.

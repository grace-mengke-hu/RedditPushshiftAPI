Got my badge. THINGS ARE HAPPENING.

SO and I decided yesterday that we're both done. We finished what was left of the pack and we're both feeling good about it. I'm still fighting bronchitis (going on the third week now) and steadily improving but the annoyance-du-jour is currently bruised ribs and tightness in my upper back so I'm definitely not in the mood to smoke. I've started recognizing how absolutely bat-shit my addict's mental gymnastics are when I rationalize why I should keep smoking. Plus I'm tired and it's way too fucking cold outside. So I'm taking advantage of the sickness and just going for it. And my amazing guy is super supportive and ready to fight with me (I really lucked out with him). Wish us luck, everyone. Rock on.

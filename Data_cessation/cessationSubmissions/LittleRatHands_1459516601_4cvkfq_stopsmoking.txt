Had my last cig on Monday and I'm feeling like death right now. Is this normal?

I've been smoking for the past 5 years and on top of mounting concerns about my budget and my health, I'm moving to a very strict no-smoking housing situation. I finished my last pack on Monday and haven't had one since, but yesterday in particular was a nightmare. I can't concentrate at work, I feel physically ill, my back/neck/shoulders are killing me and my hands are tingling. Is this normal? I'm trying to ignore it and power through but this seems a lot worse than the last few times I tried to quit.

10 days in, I caved. Now determined more than ever.

I quit smoking 10 days back just before thanksgiving..All thru those days I was trying to find an alternative way to keep me busy without resorting to smoke. 

Today morning i found 1 cig in my car and thought, what the hell lets smoke it up. Yukss... I tasted disgusting. I couldnt even go thru half of it before i threw it away. 

Now I am at work and suddenly had the urge to smoke... I said fuck it...went out to my breakroom , had a cup of green tea and walked around my office for 10 minutes,,..and my craving was satisfied....Now that I have found out a way to satisfy my craving,, i am gonna do that everytime i feel like i need a smoke.

What i want to say is it is tough....people hang in there...U need to be disgusted by the taste/smell of ciggies before your mind diverts ur attention to some other  addiction (in my case it was green tea)...

Lets kick these cancer sticks in the butt !!  I am with you thru and thru.. thanks

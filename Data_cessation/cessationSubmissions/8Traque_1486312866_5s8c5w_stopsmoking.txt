5 Years!

Well, it's officially been 5 years!

I've made it 5 years without so much as a single puff... so much has happened these past few years.  I've dealt with the loss of my mother to lung cancer, I've started a new business, I've purchased a house... it's been a long 5 years.

I used to look at cigarettes as my security blanket.  They were always there for me.  They'd be my go-to item when I felt bored, or lonely, or self-conscious, or anxious, or... well, you get the idea.  If you'd have told me that one day I'd be able to get through even a normal day- let alone a day as stressful as burying a family member- without needing or *wanting* a cigarette, I'd have dismissed it outright.  It isn't that I wouldn't have believed it- it just didn't seem possible.  I was a smoker.  Simple.

But I don't want to give the impression that these past few years have been a constant struggle through adversity, and that I had to foght through tooth-and-nail.  No, they've been filled with some pretty fucking awesome things, too... I've lost 250lbs, my wife and I took our first international vacations, I've watched my 7year old daughter grow into a little lady- just as I've watched as my son turn 14- and I can start to see the man he's going to be.  Yea, these past few years have been pretty fucking awesome indeed!

5 years down, the rest of my life to go!

Realized you can't quit unless you WANT to quit.

I somehow made it a week without a cigarette. It felt great. Where I should be. But in the first few days I noticed I asked a few friends a few times for a cigg, and by sheer LUCK none of my friends had one. I kept saying "Well that's good" and resolved to "stay quit", but I didn't realize that by asking to bum one from a friend, even if they don't have a cigg for you right then, you still fail, because you haven't resolved in your mind that you are done smoking.

So I fucked up and smoked a pack to myself yesterday. I quit again after it though, it was absolutely disgusting and after having your body get rid of the toxins, you see that cigarettes actually taste like shit. It was gross. Clung to my clothes. Everybody smelled it. I smelled it. And I kept wondering why I was forcing this disgusting smoke down my throat. I literally kept thinking every cigarette I had, "This is absolutely disgusting. Why am I smoking this?"

Trying again, here goes. This time, I am firmly "resolved to quit" though, and won't be asking to bum a cigg from anyone... because if you do that, that means you haven't really "quit".

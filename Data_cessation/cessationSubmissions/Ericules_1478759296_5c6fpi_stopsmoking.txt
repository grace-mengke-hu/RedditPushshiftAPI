Ready for my next real attempt

I quit once when going to China , came back and didn't smoke for a year. For whatever reason picked it back up, right back at a pack a day. This drug on, another one year quit attempt ended by a beautiful classmate and a Newport. Back at pack a day.

What worries me is these previous times I quit to horrible lack of energy/constantly sick/lung pain, disgust while smoking.

Anymore I feel fine smoking, I can smoke 2 or 3 in a row and my throat and lungs feel dandy. The thing is, the even after doing this, I want another. I changed up meds, so perhaps a reason, but I could really go for a cig and I just had.


Shits bleeding my bank dry at close to 22 $6.86 packs a month, and probably killing some of my social / sexual / life drive. I just don't have any apparent effects that I can directly attribute.... I mean I guess the thing is I'm not really feeling it this time, but it's been 4 or 5 times I tell myself I won't smoke when I wake up and do within an hour, without even contemplating it. I don't know where to find the motivation or care that's needed for a real quit this time...

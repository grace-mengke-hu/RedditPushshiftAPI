millionth time - Beaten amphetamine addiction 3 months ago. Smokes next

So ready to have my millionth crack at quitting smoking. Beat my amphetamine addiction 3 months ago to help save my marriage, all back on track with a lot of support from my wife. Now it's time for smokes. Ready for this...can't be as bad as drying out!

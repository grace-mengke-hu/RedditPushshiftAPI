Chantix Day 5

My long-winded story. 

I was a smoker from the age of 15 to 29. I decided I wanted to quit because it would be over half of my life that I was a smoker. I got a prescription for Chantix and 4 days in, a switch flipped in my brain and cigarettes were no longer as satisfying and I didn't really need them anymore. It was a miracle. I had tried to quit so many times before and wasn't strong enough on my own or with a patch. The Chantix gave me the crazy-ass dreams which were disturbing, but it was worth it. I wanted to shout it from the rooftops. I went into a horrible depression that lasted several months afterwards. Bad. Like, sitting on the couch crying for no reason all day bad. But when I looked back, I had quit and I said I'd do it again. 

Fast forward to age 36, I was in a really bad place in my life and started again last September. Ridiculous. A couple weeks ago I got a cold and the cough was just the worst. I can't afford this on so many levels. I went and got another rx for Chantix and I'm on Day 5 right now. I'm sleeping like shit. The dreams haven't started full force yet because I'm not on the full dose, I think. 

I'm super prone to depression so that part makes me nervous. But the first time around I was not on my wonderful antidepressants and also I was in a shitty marriage. So I'm really hoping it won't be so bad this time. 

Just wanted to get it out there. I can't wait to get my badge going. It will be soon. They're already becoming less and less appealing by the hour. 

Thanks for reading if you got this far. And yes I have read Easyway :)

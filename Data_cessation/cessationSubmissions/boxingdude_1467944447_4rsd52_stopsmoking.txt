Fifth day out- had a weak moment...

I've been smoking since 1978 and I was up to two packs a day. Definitely in the hurt locker at day five. On my way to my physician for a check up, I said to myself "fuck it, I need a smoke". I pull over into a gas station, walk in. Up to the counter, mouth watering for a Marlboro special blend light. Already picked out a new lighter and the cashier asked what I wanted. I set the lighter back in the rack, grabbed a pack of wintergreen Certs, paid my 1.48 with tax and walked out. I got in my car and my hands were shaking. Close call.

Hey how do we put my quit date on my profile?

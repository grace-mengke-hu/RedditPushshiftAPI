Attempt Number 2

I’ve been a smoker for 9 years. I started when I was 17. This is my second attempt to stop, my first attempt I had 3 months under my belt and then I had a slip. I’m determined to quit this time. It’s my goal to have not put myself through 10 years of smoking. I know I can do it. Wish me luck everyone!

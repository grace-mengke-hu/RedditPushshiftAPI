Everything hurts... help!

I’m on day 13 of quitting. Used to smoke ~1 full pack a day for about a year. Prior to that I smoked ~5 or 6 cigarettes every day for a few years. I am also a daily weed smoker (primarily via bong) and have been for a few years. 

I used an ecig for a bit but I don’t crave cigarettes anymore. I’m completely prepared to quit and haven’t had any cravings in the past two weeks. HOWEVER... I am having the hardest time breathing! It feels like I started smoking /more/ rather than feeling like I quit. I get super winded going up the stairs, which should not be happening to a 22 year old. Basically all I can do is sit at my desk or lay down in bed. Everything else knocks the wind out of me. I’ve been waking up in the middle of the night wheezing and it feels like someone is sitting on my chest. Also I have a minor cough with a tickle in my throat, but it’s not nearly as much of a problem as the breathing. 

I know this is normal, but how long is this supposed to last? I have no intention of quitting smoking weed, is that going to hinder the healing process? I just want to feel better :(

First big craving after 6 months of being smoke-free over something stupid.

Currently playing a game called Limbo.

If anybody has completed the last few chapters without wanting to rip your pc to shreds then I applaud you.

Onto the last chapter and needing a break after missing timed jump after timed jump and having to do it over and over and over again. So much stress over something so small.

This is the first time I've felt like I needed a cigarette to 'calm me down' in so long, the cravings pretty much gone but I would've thought that those feelings would be gone by this point. Is it normal to still feel such strong cravings after being without for so long?

Do the Novartis Nicotine Patches (by Habitrol) set off metal detector wands?

I noticed that the patch seems to have a metallic strip but I'm not sure if it'd be picked up by a metal detector wand.

Anyone know the answer to this? I'm taking the GRE and they have a metal detector wand that they use on people before they enter the test.

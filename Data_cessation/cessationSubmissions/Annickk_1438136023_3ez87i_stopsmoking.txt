I tried... and i stopped...

Hi guys...
I just wanted to share my story, just to feel better and to talk to someone.. 

My parents are gone for a trip far from my home and they leaved me alone.. So, I was watching the tv and i saw someone smoking and i told myself... i should try it ! I took my keys and bought a pack of 25 cigarettes. I smoke one... and it felt good.

So the next day (today), i took another one... and another ... i took 4 cigarettes in one night. After the last one, i told myself : What the fuck ? You know that's not good and your parents won't be proud of you.. They like you and they dont want you to feel bad. So, i took the pack... remove all the cigarette and cut them in 2 parts.. i put water on them and throw them away in the trash.

After that, i felt very weird, and i vomit to make me feel better. I think it was a good choice to throw that away... I did something good for me...

(Sorry for my english, im french)

I'm tired of starting, stopping, starting, stopping. This is it.

I've played games with myself for about 6 months now. I'd get a few days, then go back for a few weeks, get a week here or there and inevitably go right back. I'm done with this, I want to breathe again. I'm tired of this shit. I'm 26 and have been consistently smoking for about 10 years. I'm done today.

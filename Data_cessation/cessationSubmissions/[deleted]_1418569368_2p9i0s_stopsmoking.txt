Had a double, super buzz last night with huge crowd of smokers and....

I did not smoke! I did not even have cravings for most of the night, which really surprised me. The last hour or so got a little dicey, but I primal screamed it out and called it a night.  

The lack of hangover is astounding. Hey, you young lurkers who are recent smokers, you gotta give that shit up. Everything is definitely better without being shackled to smokes.

Just some other subreddits that helped me quit smoking :)

The first one should be pretty obvious:
http://www.reddit.com/r/fitness and http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness
Its an awesome subreddit that helps me with my gaining. You should try lifting weights no matter WHO you are. I think the dedication to fitness REALLY REALLY helps keep my mind away from them dirty durries.

This one may be surprising:
http://www.reddit.com/r/hardbodies (NSFW)
Its a subreddit full of photos of fitness models, I'll admit that some girls may be a bit chunky but some of them are perf. You know these girls wouldn't touch a cigarette... or a guy that smokes. I would hate to get cocked blocked by a cigaretter!!!
 
And of course:
http://www.reddit.com/r/getmotivated

I swear guys, once you get serious about your fitness you will not even think about cigarettes unless its "oh wow that looks disgusting, how can anyone want to put that into their bodies."

Keep up the good work, fellas!!!

Hungover cravings

Iâ€™m 11 days smoke free now from quitting cold turkey. I had a few too many drinks last night and have a bit of a hangover today. The cigarette cravings have come back in full force today. It feels like the first day of quitting! Has anyone else experienced this? I used to smoke a lot more than usual when I was hungover. Maybe this is why...?

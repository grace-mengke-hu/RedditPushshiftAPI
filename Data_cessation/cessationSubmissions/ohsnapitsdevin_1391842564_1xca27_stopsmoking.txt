I can't stand this sometimes.

So I quit a week ago with my boyfriend. It's been going well, and the only smoking I have done has been in my dreams. However, I am going absolutely insane - I hate that I picked up the habit, I hate that every day I want a cigarette, I hate that everyday I have to be strong and forget about those bastards. I hate that I think I will fail, or that I will relapse sometime in my life. 

I know it's mental at this point, but holy crap I miss it. Right now it is snowing, and all I want to do is sit on my porch, watch the snow fall, and smoke. That, and my roommates are driving me insane and I want to get out of the house. 

I don't regret my decision, I just hate feeling like this.

Stay strong guys. 
It's worth it.

All this free time now...!

Quit 3 days ago, and feeling better physically and mentally already.  Smoking made me feel slow, physically groggy.  And what a tremendous waste of time!  ~10 minutes of sitting around doing nothing about 20x per day!  

But... I'm now finding myself almost at a loss with all this free time.  Filling this free time constructively is my goal. I'm curious how others handled this unique sensation, whether you even noticed all the newly freed time, and how you chose to fill it.

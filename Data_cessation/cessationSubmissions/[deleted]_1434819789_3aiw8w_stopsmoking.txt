I blew it and I need to quit again

On February 2, 2014 I decided I had smoked my last cigarette.  I read Alan Carr's book over and over, and it finally clicked.  I stayed home from a Super Bowl party that day because I knew how hard it would be to not smoke, and I was serious about quitting.  I made it about 9 months.  I felt great.  I didn't have the nagging nicotine withdrawal pangs, I could breathe, among a host of other benefits.

One drunk night I smoked a couple cigarettes with my friend.  The next weekend I smoked probably 10.  A couple weeks later I was drunk in a 7-11 and I bought a pack, and I've had a pack in my pocket ever since then, about 8 months now.

I'm up to about a pack a day.  I got a new job where everybody dips, so now I spend about $10 a day on nicotine products.  Add a couple bucks for a soda or something every time I buy cigarettes, and I've got myself a very expensive habit.

Starting smoking again has cost me so much.  Too much to get into, but suffice it to say smoking has had a huge negative impact on my life in recent months.

I know I need to quit.  What's worse is that I even know HOW to quit, as I've done it before.  I just can't seem to do it. I'm 30 and I'll be lucky to hit 50 if I keep smoking.  

Please give me words of encouragement and tips.  I want to get back on the wagon.  Convince me please.

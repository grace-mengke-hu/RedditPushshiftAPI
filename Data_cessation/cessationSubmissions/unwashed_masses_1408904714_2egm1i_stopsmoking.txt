Tomorrow is 15 days. So I wrote a song (with apologies to Prince)

Just amusing myself with all the extra time not smoking gives me. Please read in a Sinead O Connor voice.

It's been seven hours and fifteen days

Since I quit you, cigarettes

I go out every night and sleep all day

Since I quit you, cigarettes


\

With my minty breath I can do whatever I want

I can kiss whomever I choose

I can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant

With the money 

With the money that I've saved

\


`Cause not smoking is

Not smoking is so cool


\

I sometimes crave without you here

Like a bird without a song

But each time I beat one my addiction's falling

addiction's falling

To stumble now would be so wrong


\


I could go drinking in every bar I see

But they'd only remind me of you

I went to the doctor and guess what he told me

Guess what he told me

He said, "Boy your lungs are healthier, you're happier no matter what you do."

And he's no fool

`Cause not smoking is so cool

All the flowers that I planted, 

In the grave yard

For friends u killed that went away 

I know that living with u baby was sometimes nice

But I'm willing to give quitting another try

\

Cause Not smoking is

Not smoking is so cool

Not smoking is

Not smoking is so cool

Not smoking is

Not smoking is so cool

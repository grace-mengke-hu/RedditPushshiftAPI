84 days smoke free and I just jogged 10km in an hour!

Just needed to share this because I’m pretty proud of myself. I don’t think I have jogged for that long of a session in my life to be honest. 
I originally started hitting the gym because I wanted a distraction when I began my quit, also I didn’t want to gain weight. Now I lift weights 2 times a week and do cardio either at the gym or go jogging 2 times a week... who’d of thought this is where I’d be right now. 
And although it was a distraction at the beginning it has because ammunition for any cravings I may have now. Why would I want to poison myself when it feels this good to feel and look this healthy and strong. 
Thank you everyone in this sub for sharing your encouraging words and even sharing how discouraged you felt at times. You were all a huge help. And a big shout out to my man Allen Carr. I don’t know how much longer it would have taken me to get here without your words.

From the age of 15 to 31 I inhaled roughly 150,000 of those death sticks. Never Again. 
If I can do it so can you!

I'm stuck in a loop

I'm writing this as I'm smoking, and it's annoying the fuck out of me.
I've read Allan Carr's book twice (I quit for 9 months after the first reading), and recently downloaded the smoke free app, as well as started drinking water with a slice of lemon to help with the cravings, but I have one hurdle left having trouble with...
I can't seem to resist smoking at work.

At home I'm fine, on the weekends I'm good but, once I get to work (factory job with a lot of smokers) I just seen to find myself asking my coworkers for a smoke almost every break.

You guys are amazing and you really helped me last time (different account), Im going to get Champix tonight, and I don't know what to expect, I'm just looking for that little extra something to help me with this last hurdle so I can escape this trap for good.

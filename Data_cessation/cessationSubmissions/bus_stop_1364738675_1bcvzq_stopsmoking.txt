Quit 20 days ago. Hating every minute.

I just need to rant, so please indulge me for a moment. 

I'm not happy about quitting. I don't want to smoke for all the right reasons, but I also love smoking. I'm conflicted and it feels like a constant battle. I read on here how great people are feeling and I envy them. I don't feel great. Or proud. I simply miss smoking because I enjoy it. I feel like there is a constant gnawing. It's driving me nuts and I wonder when it will end. 

I persist because despite my love of smoking, it's not something I wish to continue. But damn, it's psychological warfare in my head right now.

Edit:  It's nice to hear others are struggling like I am. I was starting to think I was alone in my battle as opposed to being super duper psyched and excited about quitting as most posters seem to be. Despite my self-indulgent whine, I'm pushing through and still smoke free. Thanks for your insights, I appreciate it and will take lots of it on board. 

Good luck folks! :)

The "Headwork" Is The Hardest Part

39 years of smoking, with many quitting attempts. some were a few hours, many were 3+ months long, a couple were 2+ years long. i want this to be my Last Quit Ever. i want to be healthy enough to enjoy my [future] grandchildren. i want to be eligible for the job i really want [facing a nic test in 2 weeks]. i can't afford my $320/month cig habit.

these are my reasons/motivations. all very rational, yeah? i KNOW all this at the "top" of my thinking. please, why then, am i so emotional/sad/sleepless, while i'm putting so much energy and concentration into doing what is BEST for me?

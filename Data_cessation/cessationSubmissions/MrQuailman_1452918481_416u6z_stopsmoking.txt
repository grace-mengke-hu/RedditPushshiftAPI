A journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step.

I've been a smoker for about 9 years. My father, who is my hero, smokes and has for over 40 years. It's weird to say but I remember driving with him in his truck and absolutely KNOWING I was going to smoke one day. It didn't matter that he told me over and over and over again that it was the worst decision he ever made in his life. I knew it was bad for me and I knew how disappointed he would be when I started, but I chose to smoke anyway. For the first couple years I honestly loved it. Then the smell, my teeth, the cost, it all seemed to catch up with me. I finally realized why my dad told me over and over again not to follow his steps. By this time I was hooked. 

I spent years gearing myself up to quit. Nothing ever stuck. I smoke a little less than a pack a day and it went from something I enjoyed doing to my most embarrassing trait. I've improved myself in so many ways over the last few years but quitting smoking was always something I said I would do later. Well later is now. I bought Allen Carr's book and have started my journey. I know it won't be easy but it honestly is the most important thing I've ever done in my life. I'm not married. I don't have kids. I don't even have a girlfriend. So I'm making this decision not for anyone else but for myself. 

I'm basically looking for any advice. Literally anything that helped all of you. Wish me luck! Not luck I guess but discipline. Wish me discipline?!

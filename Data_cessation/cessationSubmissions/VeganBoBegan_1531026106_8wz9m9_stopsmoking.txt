3 Years Smoke Free (YIPEE!)

Under a different username 3 years ago /r/stopsmoking was invaluable to my smoking cessation. I checked in everyday even though I didn’t comment everyday. I also had an app that told me how many minutes/hours/days/weeks/how many cigarettes not smoked/how much health I gained from quitting and both this sub and the app helped me tremendously. 

I used Wellbutrin for ~7 weeks then got off because of the anxiety it gave me but I do credit the Wellbutrin for cutting my cravings back. 

I watched the Allen Carr video and it really helped me changed my mindset on what smoking was and how quitting is not a punishment.

I still think about it. I only ever crave it when I’ve been heavily drinking which is hardly ever. 

Yes I still get “the dreams” and I always feel guilty and defeated. I wake up so thankful I didn’t actually smoke. 

I didn’t gain weight, unless you minus the time I had a baby 2.5 years after quitting smoking,  but I’ve been on Weight Watchers so that has definitely helped.

The smell mostly bothers me but sometimes I will smell a particularly fragrant cigarette. I “enjoy” the smell for a moment but still forever grateful I’m over it.

It was very hard the first weeks but I always remembered why I wanted to quit and I *knew* I wanted to quit and be done smoking. If you don’t really know then you won’t be successful. You have to be strong minded in this journey!

Good luck to you all!!!!!

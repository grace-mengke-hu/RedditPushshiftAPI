what benefits/positives have you noticed since you quit smoking?

Im 24 was a smoker for a couple years. Today is day 3 of the rest of my smoke free life. Ive realized that im better off without cigarettes.  As an ex smoker, what little or big things did you notice that made you happy you no longer smoke?

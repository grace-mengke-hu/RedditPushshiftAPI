Day 2

From 10 - 15 a day for 18 years to my 2nd day with no smoking, been taking champix from last week, still get that craving pang every couple of hours, doesn't help that I work with smokers whom I've always joined for a ciggy.  They seem to delight in teasing me to go out with them & smoke.  So far I have not.  

Noticed I've become extremely short tempered & having massive difficulties sleeping.

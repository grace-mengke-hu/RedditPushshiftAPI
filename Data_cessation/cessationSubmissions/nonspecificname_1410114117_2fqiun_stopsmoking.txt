14 hours in... This time, I'm quit for good.

Hi everyone.  I'm 24 f and I'm finally done with smoking after 10 years of nearly a pack a day.

I've been a lurker on /r/stopsmoking for over a month now, since my last quit. I went over three days last time and eventually gave in to the rationalisations that the nicotine was planting in my mind. I should have posted here to keep myself accountable.

For the past few weeks, I've been building up my resolve. I'm doing it again but this time is for good. I'm done with smoking, I didn't even enjoy it anymore. Every cigarette had a guilt attached to it and I don't want that in my life anymore. 

Wish me luck you guys!

is passive smoke something to worry about?

i quit 8 and a half weeks ago cold turkey... coming up to the 2 month mark. i'm just a bit worried though, i live with other smokers and although they don't smoke in the house, the other night when i went out with them, they were smoking next to me. thinking nothing of it, because I'm so used to being around smokers, i went to bed and was fine. 

the next day i was more weezy/coughing more than usual, despite the app on my phone saying my 'coughs and weezing' is continually improving. i then realised that my hair and cardigan reeked of smoke. this sickened me as in sobriety i hate the smell and thought i was done with the coughing after week 3! 

is passive smoke seriously gonna make me ill? also, is it like I'm still a smoker if tobaccos around me... you know if you sniff the air and reminisce about the time you were a smoker, i sniff it quite strong sometimes because when I'm drunk i like the smell of smoke. just want to check there is no tobacco in my system!!

It's been a few hours.

I'm contemplating the seriousness of the attempt. The hardest thing I've come across is maintaining a healthy train of thought. I usually get drowsy, even at work (hardscaper) after not smoking for, say five hours? Super weird. What're some things that keep your mind busier or more mindful of the moment and situation at hand?

Question about those first 3 days

I have heard from multiple sources that the first three days after that last smoke are the most difficult because that is how long it takes for the nicotine to be expelled from the body. It seems to me that the most difficult period would be AFTER the nicotine is gone. In other words, the real challenging period should begin after those first three days.

To my fellow ex-smokers, what was your experience?

Any good links to share that could shed some light on this part of cessation?

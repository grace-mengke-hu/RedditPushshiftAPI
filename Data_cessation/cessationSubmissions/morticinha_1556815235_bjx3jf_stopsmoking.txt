12 hours

First of all, thanks for this amazing sub. I'm 12 hours without a cigarette, chewing gum like a maniac and the anxiety is driving me crazy, so I'll share my history. I started smoking as a freshman, it was fun and made me look cool. It's been six years, I denied my addiction during the first 3, claiming I could stop whenever I wanted... Well, it's been three years of talking about quitting and never spending more than one day untill returning to it. Practically all of my friends smoke, which is a huge trigger, but I'll be stronger and in the worst case scenario move away while they smoke so the urge won't beat me.

Most of my family died of N types of cancer, I'm terrified of it. Sometimes I feel my chest hurting but I won't see a doctor because my fear of what I could have done with myself is bigger than anything. 

I used to be patologically depressed, so the idea of dying was kind of conforting, but I feel better and I want to live, as if I want to have kids, see the world, meet my grandchildren, I must stop harming myself.

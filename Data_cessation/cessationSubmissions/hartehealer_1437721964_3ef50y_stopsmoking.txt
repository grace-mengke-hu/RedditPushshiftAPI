Reseting the badge and returning to the sub after bumming, that lead to buying a new pack.

I'm currently awake at 3am, unable to sleep because my resting heartrate is too high and making me restless. I can feel my pulse in my chest, in my arms, and hear it in my ears and it's impossible to sleep. And I know it's nearly entirely due to smoking far too much and because I had no mental safeties to keep myself from buying a pack after bumming off my manager these past two weeks.

It's not like this is my first rodeo. I'm just so frustrated with myself, given the health issues I've had these past two years, it should be in my head by now that smoking does nothing but worsen my already ailing body.

I think the moment I let my willpower go was when I was on the phone with my boyfriend and he bought a pack of cigarettes after he'd told he'd quit too so when I moved closer to him, we'd be quit together. Suddenly my mind yanked up "if boyfriend can buy a pack so can you."

I'm going to rewatch the Allen Carr video but I am also desperate to purchase his book so I have it on me whenever and wherever regardless of my access to wifi or cell signal.

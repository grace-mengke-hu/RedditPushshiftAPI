Day 3 on Chantix

Hey guys. I figured I’ll post some periodic updates on my journey to quit. I started chantix three days ago after much deliberation with myself and those around me and doing lots of research because as I’m sure most of you know the side effects can be pretty gnarly. so I decided to go ahead with taking it as long as I was monitored by a few people close to me to make sure I don’t lose my mind. 

I’m usually a pack a day smoker and the first day I started it (3 days ago) I bought a gross off brand that I don’t usually smoke and that lasted me until this morning. So I’ll take that as a small victory. The cravings are not as strong I’ve noticed but I’m super agitated sometimes during the day. I set my quit date for July 10th! 
Mind over matter. I can do this. 🙏🏼

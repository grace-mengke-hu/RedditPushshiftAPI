"Too old" to quit smoking?

I've seen a lot about the advantages of quitting smoking; obviously it is the right thing to do, but I have recently been stressing about my father's health. I've been so preoccupied with the thought of him dying that I've slipped into a major depressive state and I can't function. Today I admitted to him how I had been feeling, and why I've pretty much just been an asshole lately. He promised me he would quit. 

Now I'm worried about him quitting. He is 65 years old and HEALTHY. The man climbs trees like a lumberjack and lops off branches; he shovels the driveway like a maniac. He isn't what you would call "fit", but he is a more youthful seeming man. 

My concern is that the quitting will cause his body some kind of shock or stress that will lead to health problems. He has been smoking for 40 years. 

How ridiculous am I being for thinking this?

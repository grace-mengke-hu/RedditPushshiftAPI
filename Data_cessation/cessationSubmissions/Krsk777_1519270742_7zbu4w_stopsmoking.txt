24 hours cold turkey so far more to come

I QUIT! 24 hours ago I smoked my last cigarette. After smoking the last 5 years, up to 2 packs a day, I have finally called it quits. Over the last few years I was smoking a pack a day as an everyday routine.

Part of me wants to use the cost of smokes as the logical reasoning for quitting. Which it is what I will tell everyone, but at the same time I know they are killing me.

I don't want to keep doing it. I want to strive. Smoking makes me take longer to get going in the morning. It takes longer for me to simply get out of bed. I don't know if the reason is physical, like dehydration, or psychological, like depression caused by sucking in burning plant material for a "buzz". It takes longer to start my day because I have to have cigarette before anything. 

Everyday I would have my morning smoke and then go back in and brush my teeth trying to hide the smell and try to prevent damage to my teeth, if that is even possible. Then I would smoke on the way to work, before going in, at break, at lunch, at break, on the way home, at home, before dinner, after dinner, before shower, after shower. If your keeping track you might have noticed that's not a whole pack a day but I liked to squeeze in 2 cigarettes during my 10 minute breaks so you could imagine how my 25 min car rides and 30 min lunches looked.

One of the worst parts is trying to have friends because unless they smoke, good luck. They can't handle the smell. I don't blame them and I can't wait until I get to that point. During this long winded stream of conciousness I thought about the taste and smell of cigarettes, both seem good in my mind right now but I know the truth.

Anyways I just wanted to share my feelings and emotions, I just wanted to bleed a little . Not really on Reddit too much but feel free to message me if you'd like. I could use the mental vacations lol.

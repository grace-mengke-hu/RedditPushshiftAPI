Second Day is hard as fuck..

Yesterday morning, i stopped smoking..i placed letters and notes all around my house to tell me that i will make it, that i should stop smoking! That it kills me slowly. I thought, why stop there and ran 10 kilometers yesterday. It truly was a good and motivational Day. Today i woke up and i can feel the cravings. Right now, i'm clean for 14 Hours and 54 Minutes. 

i smoked 8 years, most of the time it was Joints, Marihuana, with my buddys. Since last December i'm clean and haven't smoked yet and dont plan on doing it. Now my last Problem are those damn cigarettes. Second Day is sooo hard.. especially after eating, or drinking my morning coffee, like right now. Any Methods to stop myself from thinking about smoking? Like eating nuts or something.

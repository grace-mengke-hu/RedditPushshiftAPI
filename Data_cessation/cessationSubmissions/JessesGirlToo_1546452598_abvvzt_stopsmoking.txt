Newbie (50F) here... Smoker since I was 17

My husband and I have quit smoking and I need all of the help I can get. I was recently hospitalized for high blood pressure. My husband and I decided it was time to quit, although smoking was not solely to blame for my high blood pressure. We smoked our last cigarette 5 days ago. We are both using the patch. Any helpful tips, would be greatly appreciated!

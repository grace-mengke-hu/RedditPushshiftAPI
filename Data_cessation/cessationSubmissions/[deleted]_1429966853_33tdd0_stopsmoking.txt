Feeling Disappointed

Last October I made a promise to myself that after 5 years of smoking almost a pack a day I would quit. My divorce was finalizing and I really felt like I could stop since all the stress I had been dealing with was easing up. I used the Nicotine patches and it worked great. After months of telling myself NO countless times, gaining 15 lbs., mentally arguing with myself for the first couple months, I felt like I was a nonsmoker. Last Friday I made the mistake of smoking “just one” cigarette. That’s what I told myself. I told myself it would be just one.. that I wouldn’t get pulled back into it because I have been clean for 6 WHOLE months. That one cigarette turned into 6. Now I’m sitting here craving a cigarette as if I NEVER stopped smoking. I am still committed to stopping smoking but it was a huge reality check. We will always be addicts. Even after years of not smoking, you could start again. Don’t get too comfortable with your progress and get cocky like me.

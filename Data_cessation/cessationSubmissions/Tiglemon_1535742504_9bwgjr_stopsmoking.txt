On my 4th day! Thank you

Thanks to everyone here I'm back on my quit. The withdrawals are not as bad perhaps coz I want to do this I'm keeping busy knowing the mind from previous attempts and my partner is also supportive.

Still feel deep urges and visuals of having one then I think how will that be long term? I also read everyday night an article on why quit.

This time I'm also doing IF 16:8 and walking everyday for 30 mins. Will keep updating here. Am a silent lurker most times

Really thanks to this sub and people on it and the info on it I'm back on my quit so quickly and I know I can do it.

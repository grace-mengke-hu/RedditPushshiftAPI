I fucked up. How bad is the next month going to be?

I quit four months ago, but I smoked three cigarettes today because I flipped out (*very* stressful time in my life). I just threw away the pack because I really don't want to go back. 

Am I going to be in for nonstop cravings for the next month? (My entire first month of quitting smoking was like that).

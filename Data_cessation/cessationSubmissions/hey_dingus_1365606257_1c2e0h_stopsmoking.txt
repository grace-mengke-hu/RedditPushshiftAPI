Â¿Quit Smoking While Working in a Restaurant?

I subbed to this subreddit for the sole purpose of asking this question: Has anyone here ever worked in a restaurant and tried to quit smoking? In my experience, restaurants are FULL of smokers, and much of the social vibe revolves around going out for a smoke break.    
Most recently, I quit smoking cigs at New Years. I went clean for about three and a half months, due in large part to the fact I wasn't working in a restaurant at the time. Now I'm back in a busy restaurant at the oceanfront and almost as soon as I walked in the door I was craving a cig. I'm smoking again now but I know that I really want to stop, again, and for good.     
Restaurant workers and (ex)smokers of reddit, have you any input?

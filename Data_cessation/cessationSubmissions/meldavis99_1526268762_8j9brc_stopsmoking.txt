I am quitting tomorrow

I have read tons of online material about preparing, have taken the steps a few times in the past, but the only thing I've left out previously is letting people know my intentions. Each and every time I have set a date in the past year or so, it's been too easy to put it off, simply because of this step. 

This time I'm announcing it (have already told a few people, got a currently smoking quit buddy, and a wealth of advice from an ex smoker who's also helping). 

Additionally...I've rid my space of ashtrays, any old packs, anything associated with smoking, and am destroying my last pack before I go to bed tonight. I've got a list of what to do in the event of triggers, and have some tea tree/mint toothpicks, along with some carrot sticks, for the first week or two. 

No nicotine replacement - tried a few different ones, did not like them. Plus, I want to just get the nicotine out of my system and move on from smoking. 

Any advice for how to hang in there for the first day, three days, week?

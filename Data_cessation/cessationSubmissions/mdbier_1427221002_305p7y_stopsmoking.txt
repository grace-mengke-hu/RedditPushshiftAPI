Day 11

Day 11. Things have been tough. I have tried to quit many times before. This feels real. And it's because of the amazing people who follow and post here! I know that if at any stage I want to smoke, this place sorts me out. You guys are awesome! I am feeling excellent physically. I am gymming regularly. And I feel happy and dare I say it stress-free. I feel like my old self. The last four months have been so hard for me. Personally and professionally. I almost cannot remember that negativity now. It is gone. Completely. 

Thank you!

One piece of advice: stop smoking. Now.

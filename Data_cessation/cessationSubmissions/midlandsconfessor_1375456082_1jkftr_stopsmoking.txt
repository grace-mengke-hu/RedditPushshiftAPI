Just ordered ce4 ego for me and my husband. Expected delivery, tomorrow! Wish us luck!

I am almost 30, he is 32. We have both been smoking since our young teen years.  The only time I have quit was during pregnancy. We are very excited about this. It is going to be quite a journey, but knowing that this will give us not only extra money every month, it will also give us extra years to see our children and grand children. I have been lurking here for awhile, so thanks for everything so far!!

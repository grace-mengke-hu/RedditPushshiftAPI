I'm quitting Friday night, its been 21 years

I started smoking in highschool, I regret it all the time. But until I read Allen Carr I still loved smoking. I'm nervous that it will be as hard as it was last time. I felt like a zombie who wanted to scream and cry all day.
I know its hurting me. I have acid reflux, my dentist thinks my teeth are a mess, my boyfriend quit last year and I think he thinks I taste like an ashtray. 
I'm debating whether I should go cold turkey, like I did last time or do the patch. 
Thoughts or advice appreciated.

Wish me luck.

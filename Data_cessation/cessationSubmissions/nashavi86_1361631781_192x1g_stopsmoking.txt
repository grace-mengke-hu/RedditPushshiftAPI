How long do the withdrawal symptoms last?

As you can see by my flair, I've been cigarette and alcohol free for 32 days after 6 years of smoking 6-8 per day. But I'm facing serious issues coping with the withdrawal symptoms. I'm stressed out, tired, depressed and just agitated all the time. I was always prone to some serious mood swings and without cigarettes, it is just getting worse. I go to work, come home and sleep. I've stopped exercising because I just feel tired all the time. I felt disgusted with myself when I was smoking but I feel even worse now. 

I've been reading up on articles about withdrawal symptoms after quitting cigarettes and they mention that these symptoms only last about 2-3 weeks. But mine is just getting worse by the day. Any tips or advice would be greatly appreciated.... :(

Weed Got Me Back to Smoking

After quitting smoking cold turkey for one month (I quit for 24hrs then I smoked one more cigarette because I needed that break after 16hrs non stopping battle then I tried again), I smoked weed (hasheesh). 

Hasheesh must be mixed with tobacco in order to be able to smoke it. The following day, I found myself having nicotine withdrawal symptoms as intense as the second day of quitting smoking. So, i got back to smoking. 

Smoking weed from time to time is very enjoyable thing and many of my social circles are weed smokers. Even if I managed to get off smoking, I don't think that I'll ever quit weed entirely. 

Will switching to e-cig might help in my situation?

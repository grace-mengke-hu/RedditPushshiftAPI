Think i just relapsed.

Now i know this is "Stopsmoking" but I hope you guys are okay with a snuff/chewing post.

Around the time of November/December i began realizing that i'm pretty much throwing in cancer and shoving it behind my lips, I started worrying so i quit.

Vaping has been helping and i was planning on lowering the nicotine. I don't mind the nicotine, and to be honest if chewing tobacco didn't have any health hazards i'd still be chewing.

Until today.

Had a few pouches and have one in right now. I should be able to quit easily still right? Or am i screwed?

Just past two weeks. Depression, or withdrawal?

It seems like in the past six months or so, there's been a lot of 'unhappy' realizations for me, and I find that more recently I'm taking inventory of them and allowing myself to become generally miserable. I took down my Facebook as sort of a self-intervention, or fear that I was going to start blasting off on people in a public forum.

I can't tell if what's happening is a sign of depression mixed with anxiety from the job or if I'm just going through withdrawal. 

Any advice on dividing the two?

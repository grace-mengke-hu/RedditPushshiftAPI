Accidentally stopping..

I have thought about quitting for a while... The usual reasons making me think about it. I was always scared to quit. I felt like somehow being a smoker was part of who I was. After recent depression I have felt like I don't know who I am anymore... I guess being a smoker was something I was sure of. Giving that up felt like giving part of myself up that I actually knew. I tried to explain this to a doctor and she just laughed at me. Maybe it is stupid... But it's how I felt. I don't smoke a lot... Max 10 a day, only more if I'm drinking. 

Anyway, it's been 12 days. I tried to smoke a couple of times but I actually hate the taste now. I have been using an ecig to try and replace the habit for now. I had a very short but violent chest infection a couple of weeks ago. Stopped smoking because... Well... Chest infection... Then just haven't since... I'm not saying it's been easy. I feel oddly uneasy about it. I know its good. I feel like I have more energy, I think my skin is looking better, I've actually began to change my eating habits and lost about 5-6lbs. But something still feels off.... Not right... Somehow I feel pressure to not smoke which makes me want to smoke. I've not told anyone I'm going to try to quit. The questions and comments are too much to bare at the moment. I'm not totally sure what the point of saying all this is. Maybe to tell someone, to see if I'm the only one like this? What do I do and who am I if I don't smoke....

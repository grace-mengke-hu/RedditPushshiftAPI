Been clean 37 days ! Some odd feelings

I've been clean and not craving like a fiend so far! Dokha was very hard on me..but right now, it's a weird feeling of "yay I'm clean no smoking I can live without smoking life is possible without smoking !" and " hm I wonder where my friend dokha is right now"

It's not a crave but a thought of it and the feeling of the buzz !

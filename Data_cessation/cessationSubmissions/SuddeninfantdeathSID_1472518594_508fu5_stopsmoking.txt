This is so hard...

I used to smoke cigs last year, about 2 packs a week. I play a lot of tennis so I was fucking myself over and getting lower and lower seeds in tournaments because of it. Then about 5 or 6 months ago I switched over to dip (save the lungs bash the gums) and I never realized how bad it got. For about 2 months I packed a can a day, for about 2 weeks out of that it was 2 cans a day. That's too much. My gums are almost gone. I haven't dipped or smoked in a week and it is so hard. All my friends do it and I am surrounded by it. It's so fucking hard. I can't get through the day without almost going to buy a can or a pack. Any suggestions on how to quit. It's too fucking hard.

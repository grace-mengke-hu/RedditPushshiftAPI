Finally getting serious about this.

Joining the community for some help and camaraderie.  Pack-a-day smoker for about 10 years now (can't believe it's been so long, told myself I'd quit immediately after college 6 years ago).

I've quit a few times in the past, sometimes as long as a couple months, but I always seem to relapse.  I'm hoping a community like this one can keep me with my eye on the prize.

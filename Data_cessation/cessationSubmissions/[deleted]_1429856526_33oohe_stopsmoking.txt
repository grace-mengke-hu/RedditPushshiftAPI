On day 4. Tonight will be tough.

I live in Japan. This is my first post on reddit.  Been trying to quit for a long time.  Hell who knows how many times.  Been smoking for 10 years (16-26).  Have a drinking party with a bunch of PTA members and other people who work on the Board of Education (I'm an English teacher).  A good number of these people smoke and I'm worried it might be too tempting to join the smokers tonight.

Withdrawal symptoms 2 days in.

So I did it 30 hours ago. I feel a little bit light-headed and probably a bit more irritable than usual. Also some "bad" thoughts (meaning same situations look darker). That's about it. Not fun, of course. But would I exchange it for 30 hours of headache? Won't even consider. How did this part go for you?

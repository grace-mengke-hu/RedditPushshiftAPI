Starting fresh today

I'm 28 and have been smoking since I was 14.  I smoke about a pack a day, more when I drink.

I have psoriasis, and pretty bad anxiety.  I've also developed bad acid reflux.  I'm tired all the time and have no energy. All of this I contribute heavily to smoking.

I also used to be a very happy person growing up.  Now I just feel like a slave to nicotine, always thinking about the next fix.

I'm just so over it.  I want to be happy again, and I truly feel like quitting smoking will be a HUGE step towards that.

So please, HELP ME!!  Any words of encouragement/tips would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you!

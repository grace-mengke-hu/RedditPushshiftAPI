Here we go again! For realsies this time.

So I've been smoking for about 17 years which is nearly half my life. I was able to successfully quit with Chantix for all of three weeks in November/December last year but I stopped taking it because of the constant nausea. I've since moved out of state and now that things are settled, I'm trying again. Visited the doc last week and got another prescription and he also offered anti-nausea pills. He said if the Chantix was working for me and the only reason I quit was the nausea, maybe this plan could work.

I forgot to take the Chantix the first day or two. Great start. But I had set a date of March 1st to quit because a buddy at work is also quitting on that day and I told him I'd join him. So Thursday will be my last cigarette. Ever. I can do this.

The folks at Quit 4 Life are amazing. Not sure how many of you use their service but they were incredible when I quit the first time. That, mixed with this community, I see success in my immediate future.

TL;DR:
I'm quitting smoking on March 1st with a buddy. Wish me luck.

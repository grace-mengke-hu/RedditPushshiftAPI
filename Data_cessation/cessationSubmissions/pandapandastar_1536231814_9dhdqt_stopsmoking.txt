10 days!

A smoker for 3 years. Tried quitting plenty of times already the longest I’ve gone without smoking was a month. 

I feel like this time will be different tho. I didn’t consciously quit smoking but one day I ran out of cig and was too lazy to buy another pack. After the first three days without smoking I noticed that I felt more energetic and less disgusting. If you know what I mean. 

I hope I can do it this time!

The End of Nicotine's Reign on my Brain

Hey guys,

I couldn't find many posts to relate to my situation, so I'd like to share.  I am quitting vaping.

I started at 14 and smoked for 13 years and vaped for 3.5 years.  I tried quitting in high school, and various points in my life.  The patches, gum and Chantix.  (Chantix made me an insane person.)  Whenever I tried quitting cold turkey, it was full on Trainspotting and I'd hurt everyone around me.

Vaping finally helped. I loved it. I geeked out with everyone else. I loved the gadgetry and even made my own nicotine liquid.

Lately, I've been frustrated with the equipment breaking. Frustrated with sneaking it around.  I set a date to stop, and that day was Sunday.

I'd never tried quitting the vaping before, but I must say the withdrawal are 30% of what they were quitting cigarettes cold turkey.  It is much easier, and my husband gives me great support.  However, since I vaped non-stop while working, the cravings are much bigger in numbers, but easier to push aside.

To help, I've been running up and down stairs or doing push ups during intense cravings or times of stress.  Chewing gum, eating nuts, and lots of water.  Yesterday was the worst, today is easier.  So far, so good.

I can't wait to be non-dependent of nicotine to feel satisfied with life.

P.S. - This morning, I belted out "I Got You (I Feel Good)" to get myself pumped out.  It totally worked.  I am a dork.

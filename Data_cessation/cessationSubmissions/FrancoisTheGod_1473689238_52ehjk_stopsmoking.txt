Today's the Day

At 12:00 AM today I finished my last cigarette ever.

I've smoked about 1/2 a pack per day for the last 7 years and 3 weeks ago I drunkenly announced to a few close friends that today, 9/12/16 would be my quit date.  I woke up the next morning with very little recollection of the previous night, but that one promise I made had stuck in my head. So, I figured to hell with it. 

I've done minimal research, but I've decided to go the cold turkey route- no tapering in the last few weeks, no patches, no gum, no vape. Luckily, my older brother (a smoker for the past 12 years) is going to be my quitting buddy! So here we go...

I'm at work now, and 30 minutes ago would have been my routine time for my first smoke of the day. This sucks, and will get way worse, but I have way more confidence and optimism this time around. Just wanted to vent to a bunch of people going through the same shit as me! Thanks for listening. 

Edit: 12 hour mark- cravings were coming and going until about an hour ago- now it's just a shitty continuous crave. Distracting myself with work/reddit/water/gum/anything right now.

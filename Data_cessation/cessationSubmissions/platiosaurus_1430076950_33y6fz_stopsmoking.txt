Well here I am

talking to a bunch of strangers online. Today, at 12:30 AM i decided to quit smoking after three stupid years of it. Now, 12:30 PM i tossed out my tobacco, and i'm posting this hoping it will keep me honest. Cheers and best of luck to us all, i hope i don't become too much of an asshat

3 days later..

So I've been smoking for 12 years, decided to quit the other day and it's been okay so far. No one forces you to smoke, it's something you do to yourself. So I've told myself I'm just not going to do it, and that's that. Just trying to stay positive about everything. 
However, I've noticed I've been eating a lot more. Every time I crave a cigarette, I snack on something. Heard about a friend of a friend gaining 50+ pounds when he quit smoking. How did you guys deal with this (assuming you did)? I've been trying to at least snack on fruits and stuff, but still. I'd rather not substitute smoking with something else. Any advice appreciated! Stay strong people! :D

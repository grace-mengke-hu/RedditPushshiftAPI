One year. BAM! :D Thanks a lot to ALL of you guys!

Yes it was hard. But I am still sure I made the best decision ever one year ago this day. I felt sick for the whole weekend, but it was so worth it. 

And even after one year the nostalgia comes by once in a while, telling me how great the times where with the good ol ciggys. But just stay strong, say no and enjoy the fresh air in your lungs! :)

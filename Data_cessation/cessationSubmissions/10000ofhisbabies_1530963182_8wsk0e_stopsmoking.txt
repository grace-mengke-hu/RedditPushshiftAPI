First try...

Hey team!

I am giving it my first go. I have smoked for four years, started when I was 31 (I know, what is wrong with me??)  I gave it up last night at 730pm, and am now 8.5hrs in. It doesn't seem like long, but for me it is. I get up at one thirty am, and have usually smoked some 6 or so by this point in the day. I have gotten the twinge a couple times this morning, to which I tell myself, you are so happy to be a non smoker. Ecstatic in fact. In a couple minutes the feeling passes. Is it seriously this easy?? 

It probably obvious, I listened Allan Carr's 'Easy Way for Women,' yesterday... I cannot believe the resolve I have.  I wanted to quit halfway through the book, but didn't, I figured, listen to the fucking book, do what they say. You can wait a few more hours. After my ritual last cigarette, I told someone. He was encouraging, positive, and asked if I wanted to burn them. I thought that was a great idea! He walked with me to the incinerator, I tossed in my four packs, and didn't feel a flutter of anxiety.  I was actually on the verge of tears. Of gratitude. We watched them burn and chatted for half an hour, it was amazing. I have not had an outdoor conversation with someone without a cigarette in four years. 


It won't always be easy. I know it won't, I know there will be a lot more moments I'll have to galvanize my resolve, I also know that empty, anxious, gnawing feeling cannot be solved by nicotine. It is fact caused by it. I didn't have that feeling four years ago!

Here we go! Day one!

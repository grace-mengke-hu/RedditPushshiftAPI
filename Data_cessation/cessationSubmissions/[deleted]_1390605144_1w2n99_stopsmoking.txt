Reset after 9 perfect days. Weird day. Still positive.

So, yesterday. Our newer shipping guy passed me in the hall. I was coughing from my cold, and he said careful of the weather. I mentioned when i quit smoking last week, i immediately got a nasty cold.

He said, "oh, my wife says I need to quit". I explained i bought 2 boxes (2nd box was 50% off) of step 2 14mg patches, but they gave me hiccups, so i cut them in half. I have plenty, if he wants to try.

"How long have you been smoking" i say? "2 months" he says!!!

Anyway, today i gave him 5 patches and instructions. He was excited about trying them this weekend. "I bought a pack on the way in"!

I asked him for one. The stupid part of me just smoked it. Yucca. It was a Newport. I've been real tempted to buy my brand, er, my old brand.... American Spirit. Well. Maybe this prevented me from slipping with something not so gross. I feel like i was wavering. Not any longer.

looks like i'm not the only person quitting today.

i finished allen carr's "easy way to stop smoking" and put out the last cigarette in the pack yesterday evening. made a deal with a friend that if i could quit for a year, he'd pay for my next tattoo. ready to not be waking up coughing and telling friends i can't go out because i need to save money for my next few packs.

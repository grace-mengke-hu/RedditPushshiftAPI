Best. Decision. Ever.

I cannot express how overwhelmingly happy I am. I've always longed for being myself; thanks to quitting smoking I no longer carry this burden with me, I have less "vices" to weight me down, I am becoming more content with myself, I no longer numb and fight the pain, quitting smoking helped me to face the pain & make peace with it, if this applies to me it does to you.
I encourage you readers to just do it start now.

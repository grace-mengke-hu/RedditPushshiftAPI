Going on 3mo cold turkey!

I smoked for about 10 years in varying degrees, and holy hell I love not being sick all the time. 

Honestly, the only thing that pushed me to stop was getting a case of chronic bronchitis after coming down with all those nasty colds that went around.

Finally it got to a point where I would have a cigarette and then I would basically be coughing like crazy the rest of the day. I would probably still be smoking if my body didn't react that way.

I've quit before for about a year before, hope I can stick to it once the nice weather picks up again!

Just checking in

So far things have been going really well, even though I've been facing a lot of new triggers lately. 

I'm a bit scared, though, because last time I relapsed at day 28. I'll try not to be overconfident this time, which I think was the problem on my last attempt (After a few beers I thought "I'm doing so well I could probably have 'just one'" ... we all know how that ends).

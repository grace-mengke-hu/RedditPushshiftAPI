Day 6... my thoughts so far :)

STOP looking at me, STOP trying to engage me in small talk, STOP breathing so fucking loud, STOP trying so hard to make me feel better, STOP taking everything so personal, STOP drinking so much coffee, STOP chewing your fingernails, STOP staying up until four in the morning, STOP punching things, STOP talking, the word STOP looks strange in capital letters, STOP thinking.... STOP smoking

Fucked it on day 70 last time, not this time.

Fell for the old "it's been a while so I can probably have one now" bullshit on my last attempt and then ended up back as a full-time smoker for most of this year so back on the wagon.

Cold turkey with Allen Carr's book being my go-to thing to conquer my little crack addict brain.

Pleased to be back here making the best (and only decision) I can and moving on with life as a non-smoker :)

Day 1: The nicotine worms are feverishly whispering in my ear.

So I am quitting cold turkey today. It's about 8:30pm and I haven't had any cigarettes or other forms of nicotine all day. I feel pretty good, not grumpy or edgy or anything-- just a little hazy and slightly weird.

But those damn nicotine worms keep whispering in my ear. 

(Nicotine worms are the creatures I made up that I imagine live in my brain and tell me all kinds of things so they can stay fed. They're hungry little bastards.)

This is my third major attempt at quitting smoking. I smoked for 3 years the first time, a year and a half the second time, and now this round has been about six months. It's such a ridiculous addiction. It's so easy to get lost in it and to think that it's something that you actually *want* to be doing.

Nicotine literally shapes your thoughts. It is a master of manipulation and self-delusion. I'm hoping I can hold out for this full week-- that's about what it takes for me to get over the hump. The damn worms are whispering feverishly already, though.... 

Wish me luck. I'm already coming up with ALL KINDS of excuses to not go through with this, as expected.

edit: 11:00pm and still no cigarettes .. I'm worried that I might chew some nicotine gum still before the night ends... we'll see. I think it's better to avoid it though-- it'll only prolong any withdrawal symptoms..

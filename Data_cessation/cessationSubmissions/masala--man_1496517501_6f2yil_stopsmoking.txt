Smoked after 12 days of quitting

This is my first post. I feel really guilty. It had been 12 days of no  smoking. A friend of mine invited me to party,where we were drinking and I got an urge to smoke. I thought smoking a couple won't be bad. So I Smoked 3 ciggerates. I thought I will quit again from tommorow. I feel really guilty and bad. Will i be addicted again. It took lots of efforts to quit once and for all. Is this normal. Please help.

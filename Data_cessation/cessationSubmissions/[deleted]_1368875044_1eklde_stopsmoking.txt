I am doing it today!

Hello Reddit! 
I have stopped smoking when I graduated university, and for 5 and a half years I never smoked one cig. Last december though, I was short on money and had to have a room mate that happened to be a smoker. Since then, I started smoking again not to be disturbed by the smoke she makes when she wakes up, during the day or at night right before sleep. I did this because normally I can't stand the smell. 

Anyway, last month I got a good raise and I can live on my own, and today she moved out! Today is the last day of my entire life that I smoke again.

I know that one of the first steps to quit is to tell everyone that you're quitting so if you will have second thoughts if youre about to relapse, that people will judge you and say your word isn't to be trusted. This is a great motivator for me, other than wanting to live healthier. 

So reddit! I'm very excited about this and wanted to share.

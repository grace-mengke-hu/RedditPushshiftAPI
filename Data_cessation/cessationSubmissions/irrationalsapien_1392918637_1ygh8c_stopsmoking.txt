How to beat 30 day craving

I am a cyclical smoker. The cycle goes like this:

1. Buy pack of cigs. 

2. Get major headache from smoking, but hell, I just bought 20 cigs. Proceed to smoke through pack.. my body aches, I am slightly depressed. 

3. Last cig in the pack is down. Decide to never smoke again. Sometimes I will buy some snus at this point to ease myself off the cigs. This tends to work. Quit the snus.

4. Go through withdrawl for 4 to 5 days. I hate how I am quick to anger during this period. But, hey, no physical pain. Its not so bad. Craves come in waves.

5. I'm off the cigs and off the snus. I start working out again and eating well. I feel fantastic. I love life. 

6. It is now about a month after I quit. The sun is shining. A smoke would be great. My lungs have probably healed at this point, right?  It isn't that hard to quit, I have done loads of times. I will quit for good when I am 30. 

7. Back to step one.

I am currently at about six days into step 5. I want to stay here. I do not want to proceed to step 6. However, I cannot underestimate the power of step 6. It seizes control of every logical part of my brain and obliterates it.  

I am not sure how common this cycle is, but I now sit six days from my 30th birthday, and I do not want to be a smoker.

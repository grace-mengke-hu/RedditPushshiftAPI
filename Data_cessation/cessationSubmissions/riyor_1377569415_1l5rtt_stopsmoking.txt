I'm done.

So a few days ago I have decided I was done smoking. I decided to go with the patch and a zero nicotine e-cig to help me quit. About 5 minutes ago I took the patch off to see how it will go with just the e-cig. Kinda really worried if this will all work but I don't want to smoke anymore. Wish me luck and any tips and advice will be helpful!

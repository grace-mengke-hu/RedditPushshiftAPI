Annoying app advertising in this sub

Dear mods,

If you exist in this sub please do something about the constant advertising of a particular "smoke free" app. Every second post is from an account that only post screen shots of this app with some bs story added. I mean it's so obvious. Just check the past few posts. Block that shit pls.

I hope one day i will be strong as you guys

I still remember my fathers words when i was 10 "Dont smoke, tastes like shit, if i ever catch you, ill beat the shit out of you". I started with 15, me and two friends were out with three girls. We had just enough money for a bottle of vodka, juice and a pack of ciggaretts. I tried ciggarrets and i would smoke one or two per week. I was against buying that pack because i knew i would start smoking. Everyone smoked that night and to this day, only my friend doesnt smoke, he has asthma. I am a pack and a half a day smoker. It is terrible. I hope my two younger brothers will be smarter then me and not make the same mistake. I hope one day i'll post here, proudly saying how i overcome my addiction and how i love the smell of air. Ill go back at lurking this subreddit until i feel its the right time. I am having troubles with my parents and school right now. In a few days my ex is comming back in town, ill have to avoid her or ill get fucked up and smoke three packs.

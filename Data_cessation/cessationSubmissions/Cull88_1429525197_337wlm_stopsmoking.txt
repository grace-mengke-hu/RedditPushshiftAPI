1 week!

I would like to say thanks to this community for all the tips, tricks and advice! It has really helped me! I feel so much better and its only been a week, but it feels much longer than when I went 2 months using NRT! i cannot believe how much easier its been going cold turkey, I encourage everyone to do it this way, yes day 3 and 4 is hell and i'm fully aware i still have a long way to go, but Im not going back to fags!

once again, thanks all!

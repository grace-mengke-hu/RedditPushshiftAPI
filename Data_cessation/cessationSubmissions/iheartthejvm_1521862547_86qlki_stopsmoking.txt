Drinking and NOT smoking

So I'm most of the way through Day 4. I went out for lunch today and had a pint with my meal. Usually I need a smoke as soon as a drop of alcohol touches my lips but today was different. I avoided cigs and only had very minor cravings.

After work I met up with some friends for a drink in a pub before heading back to their house for some more. They all smoked the entire night but I abstained, got a little tipsy and managed to avoid the cigs. 

I did sit in a room with four people smoking so I'm semi worried that I may have inhaled some nicotine in the process but I'm hoping it's not enough to affect me.

I'm finally past withdrawals, I don't feel any urge to smoke, and I'm really happy about it. I almost feel like it's too easy. Everyone I talk to seems to think that I'm doing something heroic but the truth is that after 3 days, I just don't feel the need that I used to. I'm not interested in ever having a cigarette again.

Maybe I've just adjusted my way of thinking from addict to non-smoker in 4 days, or maybe I'm just deluding myself and I'm going to have a breakdown and chain smoke a whole pack at some point. I'm pretty sure it's the former though.

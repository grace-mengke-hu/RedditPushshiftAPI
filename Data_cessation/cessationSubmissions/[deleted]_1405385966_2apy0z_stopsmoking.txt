And so it begins.

So, I've smoked on and off for about a decade now. Mostly on, if I'm being honest. But after spending the better part of 6 hours in the ER with my two-park-a-day-chain-smoking-friend for heart attack like symptoms, I'm done.  I've lurked on here for a while and have thought about quitting a few time in the last year, but it's officially go time. My last cigarette was yesterday. Wish me luck!

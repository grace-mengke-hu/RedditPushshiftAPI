Every day is a victory.

I quit 40 days ago, after my relationship ended. My thought was if I can quit while dealing with a breakup then I have got this in the bag! 

This past week has been one hell of a ride. I almost broke down today and bought a pack... luckily I had a friend I texted and they encouraged me not to go buy any. I am still reflecting on what caused me to even want to go buy any. I know with more time these days will be limited. 

If you are struggling with cravings and/or urges remember that they are temporary, and will subside sooner rather than later. Donâ€™t let a small amount of time now cause you to have to start over later. That is all, good luck everyone!!!

I'm on day 10. Has anyone else experienced extreme time-perception distortion?

I don't wake up wanting a cigarette anymore, but the past 10 days seem like they have taken over a month. I'm not being hyperbolic, it literally seems as if more time has gone by than has actually passed. Does this seem outrageous to anyone? I have read that nicotine cessation can cause this sort if issue but it is goddamn surreal to experience it for myself. If I think back to events that occurred, say, a week ago, it feels like I'm remembering something that happened much longer ago. I've experienced the longest 10 days of my life, and I am really looking forward to things getting back to normal.

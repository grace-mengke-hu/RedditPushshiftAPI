Why quit enjoying nicotine when you can easily control your addiction or gradually step down? Maybe you don't really want to stop, you can use this app to gain control

I really enjoy cigarettes, cigars, snuss, dip and I think nicotine is something that should be enjoyed like whiskey, beer, marijuana and all other evil vices. The big problem with these things are that they can become a problem.
If you use the app hindsight you can easily ascertain if you really have a problem or if you do; you can make an unbiased analysis of your use of tobacco products.
This app is useful for all kinds of activities, but it's uniquely suited for substance abuse such as smoking especially cigarettes.
Check it out and check off anything you are interested in monitoring the frequency of any activity.
If you find out you really want to quit you can use this more beautifully than any other smoking cessation app to gradually step down on your smoking behavior.
Me,I have quit for 5 years before but I decided that I didn't want to completely eliminate tobacco from my life. In fact I am enjoying a great hand rolled premium cigar (a nice juicy dark one too)
Why's everyone so dramatic and demonizing tobacco when moderate judicious use might be much more appropriate than going through all of the mental gymnastics associated with kicking an addiction that you really don't prefer to do. 
Just a suggestion for the group of frustrated people who have let their enjoyment of a substance get out of control. Remember, it's your life: do what you want but I think this application will provide you the answers to many problematic behaviors.

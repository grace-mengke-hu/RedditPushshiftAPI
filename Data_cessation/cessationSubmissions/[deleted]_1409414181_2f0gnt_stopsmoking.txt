Conquered an old favorite smoking spot!

Went to a show last night at one of my favorite bar/venues. I used to enjoy smoking out of the patio with the other patrons. However this time I was able to go out and simply enjoy a fresh air break instead!!


For anyone curious- the bands were Belle Adair and The Red Thangs

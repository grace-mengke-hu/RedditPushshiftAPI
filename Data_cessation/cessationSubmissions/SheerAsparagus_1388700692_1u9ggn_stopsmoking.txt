I've been smoke free for 2/2.5 weeks, getting strongest cravings now. Need help...

I haven't had a smoke in a while, and I've had cravings before, but I haven't really been home that much, where I have access to cigarettes... now that I'm home, it's as though my cravings know this and are attacking at full force. I'm having real trouble resisting, but I want to stay quit, for myself, for my girlfriend.

Edit: Apparently not 2-2.5 weeks, misjudged time when I estimated it in my head, my bad

Edit Edit: Thanks for all of your support :) The worst of my cravings has subsided and it's now more than manageable, I can't thank you enough for your support.

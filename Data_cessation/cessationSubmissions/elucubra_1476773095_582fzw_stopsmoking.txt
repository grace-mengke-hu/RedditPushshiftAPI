Welcome, cold.

I caught a nasty cold, and I'll take advantage of it to quit.

The most productive kind of cold.  While I want nicotine, my body doesn't really enjoy the idea of suffocating myself *on top* of naturally struggling for air, and the cleansing coughing is already there.  The uneasy withdrawal symptoms?  Hell, I feel uncomfortable enough by myself, that a little niccotine induced nagging doesn't do much.

I'm taking advantage of this.

2 months, panic, anxiety, weird things happening to body

So I wann preface and say I technically haven't quit smoking. I mean I have, even though I just rolled a small one for the first time in two weeks. But really, I've smoked about a pack in the last two months. Gone weeks without smoking. I think that's pretty good.

So here goes.

Quit smoking because my mom had a stroke two months ago due to hardened arteries - I don't want that to happen to me (I'm 29, out of shape and rather sedentary)

I figure it took me a long time to start smoking, it's gonna take along time for me to quit and get back to normal

So I already have a whole host of untreated severe mental illness and it's just gotten worse.

For the past three weeks now I've had bouts where I couldn't sleep. I was awake for 3 days at one point because of the panic and anxiety thinking I was going to die from a stroke or something (I'll get into that in a second)

So now in these past three weeks things have been happening to me somewhat similar to what happened to my mom when she was having TIAs.

My right arm feels kind of weak. Not a lot. But kind of. 

A few of my fingers and toes on my right hand and foot were going kind of numb. Not fully numb but like a soft feeling kind of numb. My right knee has been aching a little bit,

Again none of this severe.

I haven't been able to get in to see a doctor and I've been freakin out on basically an hourly basis every day thinking I'm gonna be dead within the next month and I can't figure out if it's because I'm crazy, if it Anxiety, if there actually is something wrong or if it's related to (basically) quitting smoking.

I did some reading and saw people quiting smoking have had some really god damn weird things happen to them.

Anyway man I just need somebody to tell me I'm ok. I can't take the anxiety any more it's killing me going insane. I keep reading shit online and it's saying brain tumours, strokes etc. like fuck...

On the Road Again

Hello All,

First time posting on here. Thank you all for your stories and posts. I'd like to share my experiences. I am 24. I've been smoking about a pack/pack and a half a day since I was 15. I've quit a few times. I got in a motorcycle accident when I was 19 and popped a lung, which led to me quitting for an entire year. A death in my family was my excuse to start back up again. I've quit a few other times for a week, few weeks, 2 months, etc., but always picked back up again after something stressful or a night of extreme drinking lol. I've tried cold turkey, chantix, nicorette, chewing on straws, etc. I'm happy to join you all in my current attempt. I am on day 21 cold turkey and I am more determined than ever. There is an app on my Android phone called "Smoke Free Beta". I cannot even begin to explain how helpful it has been and I hope some of you will give it a try. "Not One More Puff". Cheers. Thank you for reading.

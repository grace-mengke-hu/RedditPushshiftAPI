I just had that intense lightbulb moment

I have been a smoker coming up 20 years (I'm a 33 F), and last night was the first time I truly thought about my grandmother sitting with her oxygen machine after our Sunday dinners together. It was the first time I thought about how she struggled to breathe with emphysema. 

It was the first time I saw myself in that chair every day, hooked up to those tubes. 

Enough is enough. Last night of all nights I was suddenly overcome with anger at myself for having smoked this for so long. Last night I became paranoid of the damage I may have already done to my body. Last night I was finally determined to take hold of my future and turn it around before it was too late. 

I have lurked on this sub for many moons, following your triumphs and struggles, committing to only spectating and never taking the leap myself. Enough is enough, today is the day I stop lurking, start getting real and stop feeling helpless. 

So...hi everyone! I am not smoking today! ðŸ˜‰

Edit: a word.

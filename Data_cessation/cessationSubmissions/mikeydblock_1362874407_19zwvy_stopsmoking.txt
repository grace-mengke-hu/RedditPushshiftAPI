Voice changes

Hey guys...so I quit smoking a week ago today, and I feel great. However, I'm a singer, and I seem to have less range and control than when I was smoking. I've seen something on ere about cilia regrowing or something like that, could that be the cause? One if the reasons I quit smoking was to save my voice, not hurt it. Any words of advice or wisdom would be appreciated. Thank you guys

Oh, also, I'm 20 and smoked on and off (mostly on) for two years now...thanks again guys

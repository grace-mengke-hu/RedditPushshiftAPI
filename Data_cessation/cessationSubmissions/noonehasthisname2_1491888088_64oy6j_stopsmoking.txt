Stress and smoking

Feel like I've hit another little milestone tonight. I have just finished one of the most stressful shifts at work for a long time. I've only just realised now that I didn't think about smoking once during the entire shift!

Sorry if I'm being overkill with 2 posts today but I find it helpful reading everyone else's successes so figured I'd put up my own. Keep at it! It's all worth it.

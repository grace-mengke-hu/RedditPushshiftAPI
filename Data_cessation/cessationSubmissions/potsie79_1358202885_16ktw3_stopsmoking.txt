First 24 hours

Hey, I just quit yesterday! I've smoked for 18 years a pack a day. I have to say, I feel pretty weird. I have a strange taste in my mouth and it feels like I'm wearing a really tight hat. I'm not sure what that is all about.  Anyway, I work in a network operations center so I'm going to head in the back and yell at some equipment. Cheers!

I can smell the smoke

Today is day 9. Last Saturday was day 6 and I went out for the night to a party. I ran into two different people I know who smoke. One of those dudes I knew to smoke sometimes before, but smelling him, I could tell he's now a full-time smoker. Oh man it's a bad smell. Reminds me of like, rotting teeth breath. On the Sunday I kept on partying and come Monday when I went to work I was quite hungover. I could smell the old smoke on my own jacket and it made me sick. Hungover + bad smell = oh god I had to go home. The smell is like nothing I ever want to be associated with again. It reminds me of homeless people.

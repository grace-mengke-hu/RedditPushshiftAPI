My biggest wake up call

So I have been trying to really quit since December.  However, I keep relapsing.  I am currently working on day 2 again, yet I saw something tonight that put everything in perspective.

Around 1 year 3 months ago my sister was diagnosed with cancer of the ovaries, not related to smoking.  Just recently I found out that she was given a 2% chance of survival, it seems to have gone to far by the time it was diagnosed.  The last I saw my sister was a Christmas, and despite losing some weight she looked ok.  However, tonight, I went over to the parents for supper as I have not really seen them in a bit and my dad brought my sister and mom, mom practically lives with her now full time.  When my sister walked through the door, I had the hardest time not just breaking down there.  She has gone so much downhill in like 3 months.  This has strengthened my resolve to stay quit this time, as I would not wish what my sister is going through on my worst enemy.

I live in Canada and we have pictures of various people and reasons to quit and one of them is a cancer patient.  It never bothered me before as I did not know the person and they were a picture, but seeing my sister really hit it home for me.

Tobacco Companies Hate Me because I've Developed the Ultimate Weird Trick to Stop Smoking:

Catch Pneumonia!  Seriously, I had pneumonia 5 weeks ago.  At the time, I was smoking in excess of a pack a day, and I'm almost positive that smoking contributed to my becoming ill.  Lying there with my chest rattling and unable to draw a full breath, I had the realization that I was looking into a possible future that may await me if I continued to smoke.   I'm not prone to fear, but I experienced a strange, panicky feeling when unable to draw a full breath, and something in me just changed, and I haven't had a smoke since.   I used a vaporizer for a few weeks, then some nicotine gum, and now I'm nicotine free, haven't had a piece of gum in 2 weeks.   I went to a party last night where EVERYONE was smoking, and I really didn't even want one, even though I was drinking and historically it's been difficult for me to not smoke when crushing beers. I've been trying to quit for a years, and this is the longest I've gone without a cigarette for a long time.   Granted it's only 5 weeks, but I really think that I may have moved on.   If you're trying, backsliding, or thinking about quitting, please keep pushing forward, it will happen.   I want to avoid cliches, but I feel so much better, I can smell again, I don't stink like smoke, and food even tastes better.  Finally, I have to admit this sub helped also.  There's something about connecting with people who are facing the same challenges that helped me to stay positive and motivated.

Day 1 decided to quit for good.

Today is day one, I woke up and had my morning cigarette, I coughed like crazy and decided enough was enough. I have a fresh box of nicotine gum and a desire to quit smoking. Please give me your support and help me finally kick this awful addiction. 

TL:DR I've been smoking for ten years at a pack a day and I'm on day one of quitting.

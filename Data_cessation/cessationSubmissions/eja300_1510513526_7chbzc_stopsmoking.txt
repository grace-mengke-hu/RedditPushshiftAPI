Friends that smoke

Hey, I am just curious if anyone has some insight on friends that smoke. 

All of my friends smoke and I have no problem not smoking when I don't see them during the week. Going out drinking to the bars on the weekends though and hanging our with them, taking many smoke breaks, it feels impossible to say no and not ask them to bum.

Should I just find new friends or not go out to the bars with them? I'll go 4 or 5 days not smoking no problem and then see them and start right back at it.

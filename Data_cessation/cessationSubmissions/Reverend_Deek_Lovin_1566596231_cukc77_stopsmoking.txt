Lesson learned: Let your friends know you are quitting

I was basically the only person in my friend group to smoke regularly, and eventually it got to me.  Stepping out at gatherings to stand in the rain to smoke makes you look pathetic, not cool.  When I told that group of friends I was done, they were ecstatic and told me how they were always sad at me for picking up the habit.  


Problem is, I didn't tell everyone.  I made it a month clean before a group of my friends from out of town came to visit.  You know the rest.  We get drunk, one guy has a genius idea and runs out of the house.  He returns with a new pack for us to split.  Mind you, none of them smoke.  My drunk dumb ass thinks "tasty" and proceed to smoke a dozen of them over the next six hours.  


Big take away is you don't have to do this all alone.  Just letting people who smoke that your trying to quit can go a long way.  


Stop the ponies, I'm getting back on the wagon.

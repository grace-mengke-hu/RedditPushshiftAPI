3 days and so much better

Since I have a history of repetitive stress injuries in my hands and feet from a career in food service, I have a primary care doctor who specializes in sports medicine. Unfortunately, this doctor has very little experience prescribing  nicotine replacement. This doctor did not even ask about how soon after waking that I might smoke. The lozenge dosage is twice as strong for folks who smoke less than 30 minutes after waking. 

I called in to my doctor's office and they prescribed the right dose. This was important since my current insurance won't cover that OTC drug , but it will be covered by my flexible spending account.

My point in posting is that not all doctors or patients are the same. Ironically, my primary care physician was not well versed in chemical addiction if one considers his primary patient base. I still need his advice on outward physical matters since they have served me well. 

TL;DR:
Please disclose your smoking habit even if your doctor doesn't ask and remind them of the recommendations of those OTC medications.

Finally! After 5 years!

I started smoking around when I was 15. I went through all kinds of cigarettes, and left off at parliment 100s and American Spirit blacks.

Today I can finally say I do not have to smoke anymore. Some of you may call this cheating, but I decided to risk it and buy a refillable and rechargable e-cig from a gas station for like 30 dollars. 

Turns out it's great, no more paranoia trying to hide it from significant others, no more lighters (it was an issue today), and cigarette smell (although I like it, I've had a few close calls recently regarding the smell) and the urge to have a cigarette cut down to a very small fraction. 

Best of all it's very relaxing too. I will miss standing outside just chilling and having a cigarette, but I want to live longer and hopefully this will just work!

So guys, have a goodie goodie and thank you for this subreddit!

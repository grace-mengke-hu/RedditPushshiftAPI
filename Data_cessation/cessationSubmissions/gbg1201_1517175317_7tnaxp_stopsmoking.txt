31 Days

Day 31. I quit because it’s been in the back of my mind for over three years to, I wanted to but never thought I could. I only did, to be honest, because I caught the flu and couldn’t smoke, so at that time I told myself now is the chance. 

It was not hard with the cravings, it was more hard with emotions at first, brain fog and balance, 

I have cravings once in a while but no way will I walk outside and smoke. I don’t have any in my house, threw them out Day 5 and I never before thought that was humanly possible without sheer panic.

Hardest part and thank god the feeling is faint now, is that I’m losing a companion or resource to fall back on stress or answers to things. Cigarettes were my answer up stress.

Now I’m physically stronger, mentally no brain fog like before, weird how my nails have grown and so strong In just a month. I didn’t gain weight which I’d thought I would! That scared me a lot but I’m not sluggish, sleep through the night and am much calmer/ like the jitters went away.

I don’t want to get older and have cancer, or the typical smoker traits, you can fool yourself thinking if you only smoke half pack or less a day it is healthier but it’s not.

I can’t walk by my patio at night though too much yet, I think that’s one hard spot I hope I’ll get over avoiding. 

Too many benefits in quitting.

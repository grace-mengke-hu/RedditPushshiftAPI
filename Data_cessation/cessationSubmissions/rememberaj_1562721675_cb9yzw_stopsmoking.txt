Thank you TTC OPID #76670

I flew down the stairs from the subway at Vic park and hit the doors running just as the 12a was pulling away. But the driver stopped and I jumped on and swung into a seat just in time to see all the upset faces of those that hadnâ€™t run and would have to wait... Thanks, bud.

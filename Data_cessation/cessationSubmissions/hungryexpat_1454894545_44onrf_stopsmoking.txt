Night sweats?!

So, last night, boyfriend and I both woke up in the middle of the night drenched in cold sweat.   We're both on day 3 and both cold turkey.   We also both took 2 Tylenol PM tabs before bed since we've been waking up multiple times a night.

So whaddya think?  Nicotine withdrawal or otc pill side effect?

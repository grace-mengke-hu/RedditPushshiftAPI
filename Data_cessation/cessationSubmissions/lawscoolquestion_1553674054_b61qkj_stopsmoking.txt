Tips on getting through work without nicotine?

I am planning on going to graduate school, and I think I will have a tough time without smoking. One of my big triggers for smoking is having work to do, like I would always take cigarette breaks when writing long papers as an undergrad, and it always like "refreshed my brain" so to speak and helped me keep going. It kinda sucks as a trigger because while I can avoid alcohol and coffee, I need to do work. Does anyone else have the same trigger, and have any tips for getting through it?

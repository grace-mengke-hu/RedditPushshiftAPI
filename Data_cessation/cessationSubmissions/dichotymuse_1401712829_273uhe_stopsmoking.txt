Official Quit Day Today!

Hi guys,

I made a post last week about my concerns with telling people that I am quitting today...

Just to let you know, I told my BF and he wants to quit now too =]

How's that for a pleasant surprise?? Well, this is day one of try one for me. Hopefully this will be my last try as well. Wish me diligence!

Thanks for the good advice, I'll see you around.

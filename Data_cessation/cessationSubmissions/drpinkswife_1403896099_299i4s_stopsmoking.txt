Rewards and Things to Look Forward to....

Today I got out of the bath and put cream on my face. My skin looked good. I forgot about it. Couple hours later my husband said 'you're skin looks nice'. 6 days in and only drinking juice and water and I'm already getting noticeable results.

What I look forward to: passing a group of smokers and not wanting to inhale deeply.  OR thinking it smells gross, that would be even better.

I look forward to not feeling resentful because people  (family) don't show support in my efforts. Definition of crazy! They never have and I'm not doing it for them. Fuck them. I'm doing it for me.

If/When I hit 30 days (no chicken counting here) I'm throwing out my Smoking Coat. I've had this coat for 6.5 years. I live in a cold climate and don't smoke inside. It has one burn hole in it. 

I look forward to going to the doctor and not lying. No I don't smoke.

Perfume! My new best favourite thing the past two days. I smell gorgeous today! What I'm wearing today, I don't think I've ever smelled before and I've had it since Christmas.

Not having to time everything so I can have a smoke before getting on a train or tube or plane. No quick stops outside in the cold or dark.

Not feeling like a pariah.

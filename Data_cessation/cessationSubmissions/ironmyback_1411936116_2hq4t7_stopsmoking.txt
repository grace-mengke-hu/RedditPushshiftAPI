LET'S DO THIS! - a poem.

Here we go again, 

Ready to pack this in, 

Will no doubt see those nicotine horsemen, 

But I shall stay strong and take it on the chin. 



No need for a electronic cigarette, 

Let's rid this temple completely of this evil, 

And settle my biggest regret, 

Let's make this skin glow and sparkle, 



I thought I needed you, 

I won't lie and accept that you were there, 

But you were an illusion for when I was blue, 

And you were a burden for when I couldn't bare, 



So I sit here, 

Having reached the end, 

Awakening whilst sat on this chair, 

I think I've gone crazy so ill just hit send.

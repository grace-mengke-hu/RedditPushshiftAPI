Dreams

I’m about to be going on 3 weeks no smoking but I have been having the most vivid dreams while I’m sleeping. I used to have similar dreams but nothing compared to what they are now. Sometimes they are nightmares like the one I had last night and others are normal but feel so real.  I don’t know why i keep dreaming like this and I wake up feeling anxious or sad depending on my dream. Has anyone experienced this? I just want to have a normal night sleep

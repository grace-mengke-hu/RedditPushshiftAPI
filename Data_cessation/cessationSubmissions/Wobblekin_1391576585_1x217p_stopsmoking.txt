24 hours and counting...

I've been smoking for over half of my life. That's pretty bad. I'm sick of being so enslaved by a chemical. The cravings are not me, not my will; they're just the chemical void wanting to be filled. To hell with the lot of it.

Came here for motivation and hopefully positive updates. Good luck to all, and congratulations to those who've crossed the crevasse.

Looking forward to having my life back - I haven't lived it yet.

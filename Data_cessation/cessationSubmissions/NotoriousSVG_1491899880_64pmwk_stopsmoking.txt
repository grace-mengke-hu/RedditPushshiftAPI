8 Days!

I've made it a little over a week so far and (mostly) doing great! The moments of strongest urgings are generally at night (I smoked most often after 8 PM), but I've resisted  the urge to smoke so far and plan to continue resisting. This is the longest I've gone without smoking in 7 years, and even though I have moments of weakness or self-doubt, I remain optimistic that I will convert this attempt into a success.

quitting tomorrow

Famous last words. I have quit for years, months, days and hours but keep starting back. Not sure why starting tomorrow will be any different but going to give it another try. My throat hurts reminding me that throat cancer is a real threat my husband is totally frustrated with my problem and my car smells. Any help, any advise is welcomed!!

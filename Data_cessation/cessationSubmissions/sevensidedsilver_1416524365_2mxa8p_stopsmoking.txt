Appetite Through the Roof!!! HELP Please

I have quit a few times this month but this has been the best I've felt about it in my life. It finally feels like I've made it. Earlier today my roommate left me alone in his car with his ecig (my major weakness) and I didn't take a hit or ask him for any of it all day. I didn't even feel the need to.

BUT! My appetite has gone absolutely ballistic. The cutting out of nicotine over the past few weeks has caused me to eat all of my food - burning through my food rations much to quickly. 

What's worse: I've noticed my definition waning. I love being able to have visible abs - but not such a big deal I suppose as I'm gaining muscle too.

How do I cut down my appetite? I've tried more meditation, more coffee, taking walks, stretching... maybe I just need more coffee and a little chewing gum?

100 days today

100 days and some hours ago i smoked my last cigarette and I'm really proud that that was my last cigarette. I was waiting this moment since quite a while to write some inspirational post but i really haven't got that much to say... I was a smoker for 8 or 9 years, i started really early, when i was about 11-12 years old, has smoking ever done something good for me? No. Is smoking a stress reliever? No. Does it make you look cool? No. Is nicotine really that addictive? Yes, only the first 3 days without cigarettes. There's not really that much to it, i was a really hardcore smoker and i never thought i would stop but i did it and it wasn't even that hard tbh.

I did it, you can do it... Trust me when i say it's not that hard and everyone can do it. One day at a time and most importantly you really need to want it. Good luck guys!!! :)

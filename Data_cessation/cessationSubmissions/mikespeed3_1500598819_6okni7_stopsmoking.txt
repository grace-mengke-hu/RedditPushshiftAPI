Quitting for real

Just shy of 300 days ago I smoked my last cigarette. However I took the easy route swapping smoke for vape. The time has come to leave it all behind.

It's not about the cost, or how stupid I look sucking on this damn box all day. It's about the pain I feel every time I go for a run because vapor sticks to your lungs worse than smoke ever did. It's about my kids not knowing the difference between smoking and vaping and thinking it's ok to do. It's about my dependence getting 3 times worse than analog because this thing never burns to the filter. I'm calling it quits tonight.

The hardest part of this journey is about to begin, but no matter how hard these next steps will be, I'll come out the other side better off.

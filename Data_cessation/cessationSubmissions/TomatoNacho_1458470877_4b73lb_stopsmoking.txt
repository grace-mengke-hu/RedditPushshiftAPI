7 days smoke free!

I've been smoking for almost 6 years since I was 15, half a pack per day. Never managed to quit for more than 3 weeks. Then I stumbled upon this subreddit and decided, my 21st first birthday will be my last day as a smoker. The last seven days weren't easy and the cravings are still clearly present, but it gets easier with every cigarette I resist. I'm afraid that I've already done too much damage to lungs and my body, but it's never too late to make a change! Keep going strong!

Around 70 days and having depression?

So it's been awhile since I've checked in. I honestly don't know if it's cravings that im having or depression. It's so back and forth it's ridiculous. I find myself feeling fine one second and bad the next. I wake up feeling on top of the world and as the day goes on in slowly start to feel a little anxious and worried for no reason. It's hard to explain really, I just go through it like the second half of the day until I finally Wine Down around 11pm. I know I'm not going to pick up a cigarette over it but it's just an odd feeling. Anyone relate to this?

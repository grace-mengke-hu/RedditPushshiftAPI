To those who are struggling to quit: If you smoke your last cigarette(s) on this coming Monday and then quit on Tuesday (11/26), you will be 30 days smoke-free on Christmas day! That's the Xmas gift I'm going to give myself. Who's with me?

I'm gonna smoke through the weekend and on Monday and then quit on Tuesday. I'm excited for this. Who's pledging with me? Who else wants to be a Christmas Quitter?

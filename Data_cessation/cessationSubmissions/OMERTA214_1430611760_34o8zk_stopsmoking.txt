Officially one week!

I smoked my last cigarette last friday at around 8pm after getting off work. I never thought it would be this easy, or feel this good. The first 2-3 days were a bit tough, but the last 4 including today have gotten better each day. I'm slowly getting to the point where cigarette smoke smells awful to me, and my cravings are diminishing. I was already into weight training and the gym while I was smoking, and continuing to go to the gym through my withdrawals helped me have an outlet to cope. I focused all my negative symptoms into lifting weights and it worked for me.

Thank you guys for all the support thus far in my previous posts. You all kept me strong when I had doubts. I might update again at 2 or 3 weeks, but I'll probably be saving my next big update for the 30 day mark. Until next time, this is Omerta214 signing off :D

EDIT: For anyone who reads this, I quit cold turkey. No patches, vapes, or gum.

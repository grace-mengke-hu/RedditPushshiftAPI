Shameful post, after 7 days I bought a pack

I work from home most days but I had to go to work for my yearly review. The stress was too much and I bought a pack. I feel like crap. My head hurts. I'm going to smoke one more and then dump the rest and start over. I'll have to change my flair. :( I feel so disgusted with myself.

I started smoking a year ago when I was in psychosis. I'm schizoaffective bipolar type and I was lost from reality. Now I'm medicated and healing but I am stuck with this disgusting habit. 

7 days was the longest I had gone since trying to quit at Christmas.

Is there a connection between dreaming and stopping cigarettes?

I found that when i dont smoke cigarettes, or smoke very little, i have extreem dreams whilst i normaly can't even remember them.

Is there a connection?
Btw. I smoked my last cigarette 2 days and 6 hrs ago. It feels bad!!! I hope i can make it trough this time.

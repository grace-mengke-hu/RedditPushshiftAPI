I thrive with organization and a plan: help me quit after this pack.

I really wanna kick this habit for good, ive tried so many times and i keep failing; due in part to the fact that i never have a solid plan.

Gum helps a lot but I really need nack up plans when I get an urge to resist the temptation..

Please help me kick the habit for good.

Dizziness after quitting

I'm wondering about everyone here's experiences with this...
I quit smoking about 2 weeks ago, after a good 15 years of smoking.  I have been feeling "dizzy" not spinning, but off balance/high for a while.  I didn't notice this feeling right away after quitting.  Just within the last week or so is when it seems to have really took off (I have been coughing my ass off prior, now it's only minor coughing)


The Dizziness/high feelings I understand can be from the change in oxygen levels in my blood.  I also have tightness in my neck/back of head.  Anyone else deal with this for this long?  Did any of you have this last for a long period of time?  If so, how long?  Any suggestions?

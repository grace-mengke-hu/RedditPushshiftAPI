Today is the day!

Smoked my last cigarette today. Feeling super confident about quitting. I've decided to use hard candy as a way to curb cravings, and the last few hours have been pretty good. I also find listing all the negatives of smoking to help too, especially while I drive, since I tend to smoke a good bit while I drive. Happy to go from lurker to poster!

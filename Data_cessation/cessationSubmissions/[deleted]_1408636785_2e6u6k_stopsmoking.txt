Seriously, brain?

I had yet another vivid dream in which I was smoking. In it, the smoking was so goddamn pleasurable and lovely.

It made me feel SOOOO happy. No human had ever felt as wonderful as I did in the dream! And if I'm recalling correctly, whilst smoking, I was reading an article about how it had been discovered that smoking cigarettes is actually beneficial! And only unhealthy morons refused to smoke.

Oy vey.

Thanks, brain... you be s-m-r-t!

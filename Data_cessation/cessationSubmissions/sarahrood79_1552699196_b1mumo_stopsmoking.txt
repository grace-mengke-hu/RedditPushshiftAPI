I’m onto day 8

I’m 39 years old and been smoking since I was 14. I’m onto day 8 and I have to admit, it’s been not as bad as I expected. I have to thank you guys on this sub as it’s been a great help with self talk when I’ve been having cravings.

Anyway, my question here is... how do I get the badge saying how long I’ve been cigarette free for? It’s really motivating to see all of you who are up into the thousands of days!

Thanks

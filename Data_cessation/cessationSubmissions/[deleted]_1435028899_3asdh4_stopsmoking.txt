The fucking negativity on this sub sometimes...

...is really over the top, and a truly pathetic display. 

Here's a reality that all ADULTS should be able to understand: people are different, and they work towards goals in different ways. 

If you don't have the emotional maturity to tolerate that reality, then you're not really equipped to help anyone. Trust me. You're not. You may think you are, but you aren't. 

You may think you're an old-timer who is "cleaning the place up", but you aren't. You're someone who is inflicting their own unresolved bullshit onto other people. 

On this sub, I believe we should be supportive and positive, or else silent. Nothing nice or encouraging to say? Then shut the fuck up and move on to a post that says what you want to hear. 

I get so provoked by these passive-aggressive, negative, critical comments, and then I find myself lashing out at the people who leave them (which is my own problem, I know - I should also take my own advice and just stay out of it, but I get so angry at these self-righteous "my way or the highway" pricks). 

Just felt the need to vent, and to show newcomers that you can and should actually express your reality on this sub without fear of reprisal.

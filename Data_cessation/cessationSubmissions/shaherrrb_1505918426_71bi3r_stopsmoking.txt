You know what's really disgusting?

An old high school friend passed away recently from bone cancer. It wasn't smoking related, but it was cancer.

I went to his wake. I was stressed out, I hadn't talked to him in years and now this is how I will have to see him. I'm so stressed I have a cig to calm down.

I go to his wake, talk to some old friends and family, offer my condolences, get that whole overwhelming dread feeling when I see him. I leave the funeral home, super anxed and stressed, so I have another smoke to calm down

How did I remember an old pal who died of cancer? By arriving toâ€”and returning from his wake, smoking cigarettes.

Time to quit, this is fucking bullshit

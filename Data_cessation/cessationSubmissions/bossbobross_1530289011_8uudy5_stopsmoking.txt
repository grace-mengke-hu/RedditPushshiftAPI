I missed my year anniversary because I was too busy thinking about everything other than cigarettes...

I had my last cigarette around this time in 2017... never ever looking back. It was a wild ride those first few months, I had a lot of anxiety as my breathing actually got quite worse at first. I started to have rattling in my lungs and felt like I could never get enough air. I furiously searched the Internet for advice as I thought I might have COPD, and I couldn’t find any clear answers. I even went to the doctor with no clear answers. I was so scared and anxious and angry. Every day seemed like a nightmare and I focused so much on my breathing that I’d work myself up into a damn near panic attack... I never thought it would pass, but I kept on. To anyone just starting: Let me tell you, it does pass and holy hell is it worth it. Your mind is going to play tricks on you and your body is going to go through changes that might be a little (maybe a lot) uncomfortable. But things do get better. Food tastes better, the smell of rain and earth on cool summers night, the ability to breathe deeply as you relax, the ability to do physical activity without gasping for air... the list can go on, but I don’t want to spoil all the surprises for you;) just know that it’s probably gonna be one of the hardest things you’ll ever do, but nothing worth doing in life is ever easy:)

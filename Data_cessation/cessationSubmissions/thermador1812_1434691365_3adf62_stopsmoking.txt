Read Easyway at least 10 times in last few years, what else can I do? Please help me!

I read Easyway and Onlyway by Allan Carr at least 10 times, last a few days and end up smoking again. It isn't sticking for some reason. I just start getting the one more day so I can quit right etc. I smoke 3 packs of unfiltered a day, so I believe the heavy nicotine use contributes to that.

 It is my birthday in 2 days, so today is the last day I want to smoke. I feel confident, but then again I always do when I am quitting. The problem is I literally mindfuck myself, because I can go an hour or two and not even think about smoking. Then I just go buy a pack thinking "you know you will cave anyway, just get it over now." What have you done that really drilled it in your head from day 1 on that you are really never going to smoke again? 

The word "never" is just what screws with me, because I'm so used to satisfying the craving. I can get the ball rolling, but how do I keep it from stopping?

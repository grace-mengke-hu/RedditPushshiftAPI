Day 14 - Sinuses clearing up, cough receding and wham! Stressful news smacks me right in the face.

TIL that I'm about to be a father, that my fiancee was hospitalised from a bleeding myoma from health complication and refuses to undergo ultrasound treatment for fear of hurting our child. 
To top this all of I had to read several emails at work that smacked of incompetency, one was a mistake I made but the rest of it was just due to poor leadership from an incoherent and imbecilic boss.


Well, I felt like a smoke but knew that I've gone through too much pain and suffering over the past fortnight to backslide and kill myself for a moment of delusionary freedom. 


I spoke to another supervisor of mine, a lady, and cried. After that I head back home and worked out for the first time since I got sick from quitting. 


I am still sweating a few buckets, things aren't so stressful anymore and I am beginning to think with a clearer head.
This is a test, I'll take it on and deal with it with exercise. This needs to continue.

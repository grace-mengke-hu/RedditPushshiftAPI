Nagging fly

It’s now day 3 since I’ve quit for my New Years revolution and it admittedly hasn’t been nearly as bad as I thought. It feels more like a fly that’s been buzzing too close to your ear for 3 days. More of an annoyance than anything serious. 

Anyway. That’s all. Carry on good people! Peace and progress.

Champix induced insomnia?

Hey guys, I’m currently on day 15 of champix. I’m going strong, haven’t had a cigarette in about 8 days now..... but my sleep is completely screwed up.

The dreams are fine, nothing to put there, but I’m finding I’m getting maybe 4 hours of sleep then I’m waking up at 2 in the morning and can’t go back to sleep.

Just wondering if anyone else experienced this and if they have a solution? I’m loving being able to breathe again but I’d REALLY like to be able to sleep again too.

High Nicotine Vaping/Smoking Alternative?

For background info, I've vaped for close to a year with some smoking history prior. In that time, I've gotten up to vaping 50mg Nic Salt juice regularly throughout the day. That was all fine and dandy to me, until one day when I was out for a warmup run before lifting, I realized partway through that I sounded like my 50-something year old father who has good knows how many respiratory issues that he's obtained via military history, smoking, just generally being old and geriatric, etc.

This bothered me greatly, of course, so I wanted to figure out my options.

It's not necessarily that I want to quit nicotine so much as I don't want to inhale it or use tobacco products to try and maintain my fitness. Albeit, if I decide I want to quit, I wouldn't hesitate, but I do genuinely enjoy nicotine. It also helps being that I have ADHD and it is a stimulate.

I would like to find an option that fits what I'm looking for, but looking at stuff like lozenges, patches, toothpicks, etc. nothing seems to reach the strength I'm looking for. Any suggestions would be very helpful.

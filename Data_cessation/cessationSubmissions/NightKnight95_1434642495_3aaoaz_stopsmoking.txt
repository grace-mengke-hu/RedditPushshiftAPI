Dreamt of Smoking - How horrible!

Day 17! Checking In to see how everyone is doing and post how I am doing.. Because it helps!

Last night, I woke up sweating after I had a dream of my smoking. 

The dream was incredibly vivid. I often have vivid dreams because I attempted lucid dreaming not long ago however this was a completely different experience. I could feel see and taste the smoke.

I woke up sweating. Feeling guilty and frankly quite upset. I've had a pretty bad craving for nicotine since this morning although I've been keeping strong! 

Has anyone had similar dreams? Any way to over-come them? Do they just go away?

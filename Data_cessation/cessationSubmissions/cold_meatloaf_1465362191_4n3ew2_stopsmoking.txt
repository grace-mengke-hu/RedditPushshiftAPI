Big mistake

I'm 51. I quit a 25yr,  pack a day plus habit in 2009. Allan Carr was what helped, and it actually was easy. About 3 weeks ago I started smoking again. I've been buying a pack, smoke a few, then tear it up and swear I'm done. Well... that hasn't worked. Whatever depression I was feeling that prompted me to have one has only gotten worse, but now I'm just depressed because I'm smoking again. It's making me feel like shit, yet I'm having trouble stopping. So it ends here.

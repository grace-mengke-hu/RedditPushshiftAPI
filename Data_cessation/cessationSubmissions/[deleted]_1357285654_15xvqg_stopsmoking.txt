Tomorrow is the first day that I will be a non smoker in 5 years. Any advice?

I've smoked atleast 1/2 pack a day for 5 years, this last year has been more/day.  My father has emphysema, I am constantly out of breath and catching chest colds, and I'm tired of spending so much money. I have my house free of cigs and lighters/matches and I'm stocked up on nicorette. 

Any advice or words of encouragment you guys could give me?

One year!

I can't believe I got here. I was the type of person who swore that I couldn't do it. I read AC, spent a lot of time on /r/stopsmoking and kept phoning our local helpline. 

With a combination of those three I finally got here. And I feel great. 

How do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time! I still hit bumps where I need to sit and breathe but they are very few and far between. 

I have faith in all of you. You have got this! You are strong and can control this horrible beast. You are all wolves.

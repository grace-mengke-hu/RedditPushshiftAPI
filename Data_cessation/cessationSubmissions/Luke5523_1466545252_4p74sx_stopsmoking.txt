Struggling to wake up without a smoke...

My smoker routine was to have a smoke as soon as my eyes opened as most smokers. Because of this I consistently find myself waking up late for work. Obviously not smoking has kept me up at night which doesn't help. 

I was vaping for a month before it broke on Saturday and had a one night relapse, now using NRT

Anyone else have this problem? How do I beat it?

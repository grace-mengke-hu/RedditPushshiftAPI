the beginning was easier than I thought it would be, but...

So I'm almost at the end of the first week. It passed by with barely any craving at all. But I didn't have work and was home most of the time and could pass time as I pleased. And I know that the real test will start when I start being around people that smoke. I can already see myself saying "meh" and going for a pack when that happens ~_~

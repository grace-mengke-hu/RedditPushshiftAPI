Does cigarette addiction ever go away?

My know-it-all colleague says that "cigarette addiction last forever".  However, I read that the withdrawal symptoms last a few days, and then it takes around 3 months for the nicotine to be completely out of the body and brain chemistry to return to normal.  Technically, that means the addiction is gone right?  And the cravings are still there but it's only a psychological addiction/craving at that point? Correct?

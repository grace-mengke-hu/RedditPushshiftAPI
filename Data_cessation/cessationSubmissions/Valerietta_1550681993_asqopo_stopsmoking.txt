Free from temptation at the moment!

Hi guys,
I want to share a big achievement that happened today. So, during the last 32 days I avoided any kind of coffee just because espresso and cigarettes were the routine and I didn’t want to be tempted at all, so I’ve been nicotine and caffeine free. Well, this morning I felt brave: went to the coffee place, drank my espresso and felt good. Not tempted at all. And during the day I had another one with no cravings either! I enjoyed my coffee, that’s it.
Plus, I work in an international airport next to a smoking lounge: feel sorry for the stressed people queuing dying for a cigarette (me one mouth ago, struggling and wasted time on my breaks waited in line to go inside and going out from it smelling terribly!).

Relapse

I went cold turkey and made it 9 days in without a smoke. Made it past the physical side of it as far as I know, so that means the only thing pushing me towards smoking was my own psychological dependence. It sucks to see the progress I had made distancing myself from tobacco be reset because of my own poor impulse control, but I have to say it makes me all the more resolute to ditch smoking entirely. 

Figured I'd post here as a reminder of how shitty it feels to lose track after solid progress. The posts in this community have been a great resource in getting through those first few days and leaving the smoker mindset behind in favor of truly becoming smoke free.

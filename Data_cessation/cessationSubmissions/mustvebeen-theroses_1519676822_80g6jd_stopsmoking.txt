Ohhhh my god my skin.

It’s been almost 2 weeks and my skin is so soft. I can’t stop touching myself: my stomach, my arms, my back, everywhere. My boyfriend can’t keep his hands off of me. Also, my chest and face haven’t seen a single new blackhead or pimple since quitting. My face and hands are no longer constantly red. 

I obviously knew that there would be noticeable benefits, but holy shit, less than two weeks! Smoking seriously poisoned every inch of my body, and now that I’ve quit, I feel like a damn goddess. Anyway wanted to share because this has defined been the most unexpected benefit!

90 days in and a question :)

Today, in about an hour will be 90 days since I have quit smoking. I am so proud of myself, and I just wanted to share my accomplishment with you. My husband is a smoker, but he has been so supportive of me. I wanted to ask you, do you have any tricks for convincing him to quit? I think he's just about to quit, but he needs that final nudge. Any advice is welcome.

Quit on Tuesday, got over the first challenge of drinking with friends who smoke

The first two days were pretty easy since I was by myself with no cigarettes around. I knew yesterday would be a challenge as it was my first time hanging out with my friends who smoke since I quit but I didn't have a single one! I'm more confident heading into the weekend with the same friends now and am so glad I found this subreddit for support, thank you!

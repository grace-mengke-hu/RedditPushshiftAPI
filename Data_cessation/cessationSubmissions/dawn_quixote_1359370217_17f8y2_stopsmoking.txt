Quitting smoking and the keto diet

I've noticed that the [keto flu](http://elowcarbfoodlist.org/the-keto-flu-symptoms-and-relief/) and smoking withdrawal have practically the same symptoms and I believe this has something to do with the way blood sugar levels effect our brains.  Nicotine increases blood sugar which is why it is known as an appetite suppressant.

I've been smoking a LOT more since I started the keto diet and I'm beginning to think this is because of my super low blood sugar levels.

Has anybody here tried to quit smoking while on this diet?  Care to share your experience?

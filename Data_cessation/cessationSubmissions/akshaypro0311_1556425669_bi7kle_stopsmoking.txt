2 years and counting

So it has been 2 years since I haven't touched a cigarette in my life. I thought it would be great if I share my experience.
So I was 19 when I first smoked a cigarette and just like most of the teenagers I started it because I thought it's cool.
At first I could smoke just half or one but we know what it becomes after a some time. Soon I became a chain smoker who couldn't pass two hours without a cigarette. I started smoking 8-10 cigarettes a day.

 Let's talk about quitting now. 
The one thing that you should keep in mind is that quitting works differently for different people. And the one thing that you need is a REASON, just one real good REASON to quit ( or break any habit ). My reason was to play college soccer at the D1 level and so cigarettes were my number one enemy. They brought down my stamina and speed and everything. And also I had a strong desire to play soccer at a huge professional level. Hence, it soon became a STRONG REASON TO QUIT. It took me about a month to finally get to a point where I had a realization.

You have to find anything important to you and make it a reason to quit. It may be a promise to someone special, or a promise to self or anything. Anything that is important to you. Trust me this is the one thing that helped me quit, it might work on you as well.

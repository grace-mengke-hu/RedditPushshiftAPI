First day today! This time, I am going to make it happen! I don't want to smoke anymore!

Hey guys! Today, after 13 years, I have quit smoking! I had my last cigarette last night. I found this subreddit a few days ago and reading all the great posts and success stories really motivated me to finally do what I've been wanting to do for years..QUIT SMOKING. I am determined to kick this filthy habit! I will need you guys's support!

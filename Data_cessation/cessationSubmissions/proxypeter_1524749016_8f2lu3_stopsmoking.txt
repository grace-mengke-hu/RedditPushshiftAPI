How do you deal with people around you smoking?

Yo guys, 19 y/o dude here who has smoked for 3 years. My question to you is: How do you deal with it, when everyone around you is smoking? 

Out of the 20 friends I'm closest with I probably have 2 guys that aren't smoking. On work literally every colleague that isn't a total moron smokes, I used to smoke a lot with my boss and talk about random stuff and with smoking customers I used to smoke aswell. 

I have resisted the last 4 days, always telling myself that cigarettes are shit and that I don't want to throw away what I've achieved but when I'm with anyone that smokes I don't feel even slightly better than the smoker, I'm just jealous that they can smoke while I can't. 

I don't really want to hang with anyone else because these people are my friends and I wouldn't want to change my friends because of something as trivial as smoking.

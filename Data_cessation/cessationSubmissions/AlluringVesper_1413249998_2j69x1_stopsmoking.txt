Checking in

So I've made it 120 days. I know I haven't posted here often, but I've been reading and lurking this whole time. It's been rough recently. The new job is wonderful and extremely stressful all at the same time. I've had some really good days and some really bad days. I've thought often about walking across the street to the gas station and buying a pack to *just have one* to help through a rough day. Anytime I have thoughts like those I've come here and read the stories people are posting. The beginning decision to quit, the struggles people have to stay away from cigs, and the successes people have. Looking here and reading that someone else has made it one more day gives me hope that I can do it too. I know I haven't been that involved, but the community here has really pulled me through. Thank you guys for helping me get through this. There are days where I don't think about smoking at all. I still have days where it's on my mind and I suppose I always will, but I feel good about the progress I've made.

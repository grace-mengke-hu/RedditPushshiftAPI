Just moved... this is day 3.

So I recently moved jobs and cities and would like to quit smoking (for real this time...). I am not a heavy smoker or anything. I started smoking almost daily several years ago going to bars or drinking with friends. Many of my friends smoke and when we were drinking together I would smoke too. 

I moved to Osaka a few weeks ago and one friend here smokes but at the moment I don't have too many friends in general and I think it is a good time/place to quit. The trouble is, I can quit for a while. 3 days isn't too difficult. I went as long as 11 days a few months ago. But then something happens, or I get too drunk or feel sorry for myself and then I say fuck it and smoke.

I really believe that smoking is tied closely to my drinking and also some self-loathing tendencies. I kind of feel like it is a punishment to myself for being stupid or shitty or whatever. A punishment that makes me feel kind of good for a few moments (only while drinking). 

Anyway, what I am worried about is getting depressed and saying "fuck it" and picking up a cigarette again. Hopefully I can quit for long enough to just not want to do that anymore.

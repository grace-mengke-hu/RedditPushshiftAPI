4 months smoke free and never going back!

I will be four months smoke free this week and the main thing I keep thinking is how the hell did I ever let myself smoke in the first place. I smoked a pack a day since I was 16 for 11 years until I quit this April. I tried to quit for years and in countless different ways, what finally worked was going cold turkey and using a combination of Allen Carr's the easy way and the smoke free app for iPhone. It sounds dumb but I didn't want to have to reset my progress on the app and that kept me going. I still crave cigarettes sometimes, but it's much less and my logical brain knows I'll never take a puff again. Since quitting I have even taken up mountain bike racing! Just popping in to say thanks for all the help this subreddit has offered and say that if I did it you can too!

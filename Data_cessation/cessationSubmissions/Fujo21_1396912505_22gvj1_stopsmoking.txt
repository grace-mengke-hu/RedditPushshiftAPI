Could aching joints and muscles be related???

So glad I found this site! Informative and don't feel so alone anymore. Just wondering though, if anyone has experienced any aching joints or muscles? 9 days cigarette free today ( can't believe I'm actually doing it!!!) mine have started to ache in the last 3 days and wondered if it was due to not smoking?

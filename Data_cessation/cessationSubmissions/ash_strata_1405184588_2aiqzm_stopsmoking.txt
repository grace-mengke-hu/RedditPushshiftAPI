Almost 11 months without a cigarette

This is my first day in /r/stopsmoking and I'd just like to introduce myself. I started smoking in my teens and kept the habit up for about 10 years. Now I'm 26 and can see my 1 year without a cigarette creeping up on me. I'm so incredibly happy, I feel great and I'm probably the healthiest I've been in my life. I'd never been very athletic but now I can cycle 20+ miles without stopping, can run a whole mile on my treadmill, I'm never out of breath for more than a few moments, and I even bought a kayak. It's all been really amazing!! I used to be sick about once a month, have some asthma problems, and terrible allergies and all of that has almost disappeared.  I haven't even had a chest cold all year, when they had been a normal occurrence (every couple months) for as long as I can remember.

I knew that quitting would improve my life but I never imagined it could make such a wonderful difference. I hope that I can contribute some encouragement to the /r/stopsmoking community and I hope you guys can contribute to my inspiration to keep moving toward the best life I can live. I'm so impressed by the stories I've read here and by what a kind and motivating bunch you seem to be. Thanks so much!!

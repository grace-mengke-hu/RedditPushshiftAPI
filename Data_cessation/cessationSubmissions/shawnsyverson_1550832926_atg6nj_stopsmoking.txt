Adult Children!!!!

Hi all,  this is my 2st post and I need huge advise!!  I'm a 52 yr old mother with 3 very entitled,   needy children that I have always tried yo be there for them. ( yrs,  I know most of this is my fault!!)  About 6 months or more so I started to put my foot down on all of their crap!  I quit smoking 20 days ago but 1 child called me stupid anf that was my last straw!!  I had been trying to be there for every phone call for my middle son and also make thing convenient for my daughter who is my PCA/ HOME MAKER.  WHEN MY OLDEST SON CALLED ME STUPID FROM THE TREATMENT CENTER HE IS IN, I COULDNT HANDLE ANYMORE!!  So after 20 days I smoked 5 cigarettes today and feel like just continuing smoking!!  I quit for many reasons including having spinal surgery on monday...  

I seriously don't know what to do!  Between the stress and the worry I'm not sure how to do this

I guess I want to hear from people that have Adult Children Stresses that can tell me how you got psst their selfish b. S.  To make past this??? 

Thank you in advance

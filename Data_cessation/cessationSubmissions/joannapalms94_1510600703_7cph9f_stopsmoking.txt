Hi all I’m new to this site

Hi everyone I’m new to the site so just thought I’d introduce myself I’m Joanna I’m 23 from East Sussex 
So I was smoking for 10 years from the age of 13 and today is my 5th day smoke free 
I decided to quit on Thursday because it was costing me to much money and I found I was smoking a pack of 20 in a day and a half and I had got to the point where I no longer enjoyed a fag I just done it because I was addicted to it
I must say I know it’s only early days but I feel a lot better for it and I don’t seem to be getting as much cravings now as I did on day 3 
Iv noticed that I don’t get out of breath as quickly as I did I only had to walk up the stairs and felt like I was dying 
Moving away from my family has helped me to give up as all of my family smoke other than my auntie who gave up about 15 years ago now and my nan who gave up about 2 years ago, I don’t think I’d find it this easy if I was still at home and around them
I know it’s only early but just wanted to say to everyone that I’m here to help anyone with advise and who needs a bit of positivity pushed in there direction x

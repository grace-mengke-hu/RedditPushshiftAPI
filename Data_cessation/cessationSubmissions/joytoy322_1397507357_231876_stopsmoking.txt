How did you guys get through the first week?

I posted here a few months back hoping to quit on the first attempt. I've been smoking for roughly 9 years. I made it 19 hours and caved in. I was so dizzy I couldn't stand or think clearly. I got really anxious and was nervous that the feeling would escalate to something worse. And that was only day 1. 

I'm down to the last few in this pack and I know if I say I'm going to finish it and then not go out and get more someone might say just quit now. Well I guess for this next attempt this is how I'm going to do it. 

But I want to know, how do you guys deal with the cravings? I've read so many awesome success stories here and after barely getting through day 1 which is supposedly really easy, I have no idea how I'll be able to survive even two or three days. 

I'll also make another post in a few hours when I'm out and I guess starting the journey to quitting for the second time.

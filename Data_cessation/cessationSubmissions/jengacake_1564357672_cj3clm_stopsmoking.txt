At around 1.5 months, having my first intense, long-term cravings today.

Hi, longtime lurker. 20 yrs old, smoking since I was 18. I quite almost six weeks ago now. I decided to stop smoking right as I came down with the flu, and I was bedridden with fever for almost four days, so I was lucky that my worst initial cravings were supplanted by sickness. My cravings since then have been few and far between, and more intellectual than physical. I would think a lot about smoking, but my body wouldn't physically crave it. Manageable.

Today is different. I can't stop thinking about rolling a cig. I REALLY want to go and by some tobacco. But I won't do it. Just needed to check in and have some accountability. Gonna go for a run and sweat it out, will check in later.

owwwwww my lungs! (question)

As most of the recent posters on here, I quit for new years. I've quit several times, but this time it's going to stick!


The first few days were horrific, but the last few days I've actually felt GREAT. However, today.. there's just so much ow.


Logically I know the deal: cilia is regrowing and starting to clean up my lungs. But my question is: when does the coughing and hacking up grossness start? (Soon, I hope, given the intense pain in my lungs...) And how long has it lasted for you strong-willed folks who have quit for a while now?


Thanks!! :D

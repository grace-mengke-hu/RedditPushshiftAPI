Vaping: Yes or No

I'm almost 3 days into quitting and doing pretty well but I had a thought this morning; has anyone successfully quit Nicotine altogether with eCigs?

EDIT: Wow, there's some great responses here. Thanks so much for helping me out. I'm thinking that the best course of action for me now is just to keep on trucking through the addiction without adding eCigs. Maybe if the cravings get really strong I'll try out no-nicotine eCigs but let's see where I can go with not using them.

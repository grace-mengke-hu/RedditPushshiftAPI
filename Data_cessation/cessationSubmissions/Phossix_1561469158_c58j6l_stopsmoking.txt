I made it 1 year (but it was tough)

Just short over a year ago, my grandmother was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. An excessive smoker, I always knew it was going to happen (although why i thought to start myself is beyond me). I quit shortly after and felt I couldn't do it. I don't deal with stress well and I did lapse 17 days into my original attempt. But i tried again and it stuck. 

Last time I posted, my grandmother had died and I spent my birthday at her funeral. I hate cigarettes because of it all, but I honestly still crave it something awful. Gran loved her cigarettes. My family actually buried her with a pack, which just felt odd to me, but my grandfather wanted that. 

Smoking was my method of coping with stress. And its been a stressful year. I'm stuck in a dead-end job where customers scream at me, and I'm being evicted from my flat in little over two weeks. I left my friend group due to a lack of support. It has not been a good year.

My anxiety has been overwhelming recently to the point even lesser things make me crave too. Last night, I got stood up on a date and just kind of wanted a pack to unwind.

The amount of times I've nearly caved is unreal. But I do feel somewhat proud that I made it a year. I've had a lot of bad things happen that normally would send me running to a store for a 20 pack and a lighter. So I'm kinda worn out, but I've made it.

I hope I can contine to come back here, not as a person needing support but to help those trying to quit too. I hope more people can help kick the habit.

Thanks for the support. :)

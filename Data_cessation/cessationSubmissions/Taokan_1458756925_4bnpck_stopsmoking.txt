Day 82

Got my first cold since quitting.  Dear, fucking, god.  Deer god.  Fucking.  Bawls.

Sore scratchy throat, run down, coughing constantly, nose full of fail, can't smell, don't wanna eat.  No motivation.

Sound familiar?

How did I ever live my life accepting that coughing my lungs out was tolerable?

I used to think I don't get sick all that often.  Now I'm wondering if sometimes I was already in such rough shape I just didn't notice it.

Gladly I'm feeling a lot better today.

Here's to 82 days and counting, to all my NYE quitters!

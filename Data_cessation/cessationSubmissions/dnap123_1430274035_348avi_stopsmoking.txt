hello. I have developed a bad habit and don't feel comfortable AT ALL with the concept of quitting cold turkey. What "alternatives" have been effective for you?

I'm talking anything. Anything that will help me quit before it gets any worse. I have been smoking for 4 years and I am nearing a pack a day. I am worrying myself because I am only 21. Thank you.

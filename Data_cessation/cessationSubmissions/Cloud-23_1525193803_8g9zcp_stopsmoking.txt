63 Day in and my really bad anxiety and lack of sleep is driving me crazy..

So I have General Anxiety Disorder.. and this is the most I've gone without smoking.. I'm proud of myself but my anxiety is through the roof.. and I haven't been getting the best sleep either.. any advice?? I don't know if it's because of the cigs or my anxiety meds... I'm freaking out and it's hard to concentrate at work..

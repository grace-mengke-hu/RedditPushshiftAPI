This time I will

I have tried to quit dozens of times. I am ashamed that at any attempt did I last no more than 24 hours.

Currently, I am at two packs a day and have been at at least 1 pack a day for the last 20+ years.

Tomorrow is my birthday. It is also the day my Grandfather died of Lung Cancer caused by his smoking. My father also died as a result of smoking. My father was only 53. 

I have so many reasons to quit. I want to quit. I don't want to fail this time. 

I have been able to quit other addictions with little effort after making up my mind that I am done. Smoking is a vice I can't seem to shake. Any tips would be great.

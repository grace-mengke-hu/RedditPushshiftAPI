Are there good aids for clearing your lungs of that tobacco build-up?

*warning gross*
I've off and on jogged for my whole life; 9 years of off and on cigarettes have left a large amount of phloem that I cough up when I go running.
I've found that it takes at least a week after I've quit for most of it to 'come up and out'. 
Are there any home remedies, or products, or techniques I could use when quitting to help speed up the rate at which my gross tobacco phloem is coughed out?

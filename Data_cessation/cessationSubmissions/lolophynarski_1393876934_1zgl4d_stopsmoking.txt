Anyone else quitting for Lent?

A friend and I are quitting starting Ash Wednesday and I thought it might be worth seeing if anyone else in this sub is planning on doing the same. Unlike most Lenten fasting, I don't plan on starting up again afterwards, but since it's a season of reflection and contemplation, I thought giving up the biggest addiction I have in my life would make for an interesting spiritual experience. Plus it was an easy quit date to mark on the calendar. Have any of you done this before or plan on doing it this year?

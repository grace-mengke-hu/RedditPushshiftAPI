Nearly 1 year in, and I had a dream last night

And I was smoking in that dream. And it was glorious. It was like a movie scene, with the camera panning around me in slow circles while the smoke lifted gracefully into the air and I inhaled with my eyes closed in obvious rapture.

Then I shit you not, I woke up and was having trouble breathing as though I'd smoked a pack the day before.

This is the first time in months that I've had any sort of craving. I've been planning a nice dinner with my hubby to celebrate my 1-year no smoking anniversary, and I feel like the cravings are creeping-up simply because smoking is in the spotlight right now.

Just gotta keep strong.

This is only a small thing but it helps me and it might help you...

I have drawn a chart on my wall so I can physically mark off the days as they go. I have week 1, 2, 3 and 4 with 7 boxes for the 7 days of the week. I have it up to a month because I think I'll be fine after that. I just tick them off as each day comes and it really helps.

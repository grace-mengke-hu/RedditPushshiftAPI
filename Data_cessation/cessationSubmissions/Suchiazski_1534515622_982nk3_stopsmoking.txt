My quit plan- is this okay?

I'm 26 and have been smoking since 2013. So not a really long time but over the past couple years it's gotten out of control. In September I plan to switch to vaping (not dual use) for 2-4 months depending on how I'm feeling.

Then around the end of this year or beginning of 2019 I will drop e cigs and exclusively use actual NRT products like gum (which I've already bought).

How long should I use the gum? And will I experience body recovery when switching to vaping such as cilia recovery and accompanying gross cough, etc?

I miss smoking? (Possible trigger)

Hey there buddies,

So iâ€™ve quit smoking for about 2 months now and Its not extremely hard for me. Once in a while i take a drag at a party and realise How nasty The taste of smoking is.

But What has been bothering me is that i miss The actual smoking or something, The act, The look, The feel, i cant really tell What i miss about it but sometimes i Just Want to smoke when i drink a cup of coffee, not The taste or anything, Just The smoking part. Its a bit hard to explain for me, does anybody has This feeling as Well? And What to do about it?

Thanks a lot!

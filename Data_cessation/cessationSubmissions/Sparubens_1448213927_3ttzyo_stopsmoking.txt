How special is your quit date to you?

Hey guys, after uncountable failed quit attempts, I decided to quit 2 days ago (20th November). Normally, I always set my quit date at the end of the month, but now I decided that this addiction couldn't last much longer and I had to quit. But I'm just feeling a bit hesitant because my "quit date" isn't something like November 30th.

So this kind of intrusive thoughts keep occupying my mind, so I was wondering if I'm alone in this or not. Please let me know

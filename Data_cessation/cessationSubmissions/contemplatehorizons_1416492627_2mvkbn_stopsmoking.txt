101

Hey, 24, 7 year smoker, celebrating 101 days smoke free. Quitting smoking has been a New Years resolution for the last 5 or 6 years and I finally did it. I am so proud. And I am proud of all of you quitters and all of you still cutting down. 

I am also sick again. But coughing up flem and I guess detoxifying is healing and I know I already feel healthier than I have in years. Here's to another hundred all around!

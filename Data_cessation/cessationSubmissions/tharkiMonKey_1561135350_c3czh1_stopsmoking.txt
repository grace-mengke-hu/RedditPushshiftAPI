I'm afraid I may become a chain smoker

I'm a smoker from almost 4 years. My normal is 2 cigarettes per day. Rarely it goes upto 5 a day. I'm afraid that I may become a chain smoker and trying to quit from past several days but somehow repeating the same mistake of smoking again for some silly reasons (or may be I'm just looking for some reason to smoke). Successful quitters.. I'm quite sure you may have gone through same phase. Please help me how to overcome this.

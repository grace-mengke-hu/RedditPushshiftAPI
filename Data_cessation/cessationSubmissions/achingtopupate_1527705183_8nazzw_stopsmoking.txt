I want to help my mom with withdrawal symptoms, what can I do?

I just had a baby a week ago, and my mom is here to stay with me to help out. She stopped smoking a month ago so that it’s safer for the baby, but she still has lots of symptoms from it.

She used to smoke around 3 cigarettes daily for a very long time. She said a few days ago, her gums started bleeding and hurting. She stopped without any other aid. I’ve researched a bit about gums, patches and vapes but I’m not sure what to get. Since she’s always around the baby, I’d prefer it to be safe for the baby too.

She says she misses taking some time in the day to go smoking and just the habit of it. She says it feels like she can’t get rid of stress if she doesn’t do that.

I would highly appreciate if you could help us out!

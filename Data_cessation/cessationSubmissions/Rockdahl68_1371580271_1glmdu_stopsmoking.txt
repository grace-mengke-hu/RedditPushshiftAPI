Did I flip the switch?

I haven't smoked in 8 days, and I'm so proud of myself. I've got an amazing support system and so much to be grateful for. Why the hell am I so sad?
I have a history of mental illness (type two bipolar) and have managed to pull myself out of it through medication and cognitive therapy. I'm at the point where I no longer need regular medication or therapy and just use an anti-anxiety medication and self-talk as needed. I've been pretty stable, until now. Every little speed bump makes me cry. All I can think about it when I get off work so I can go back to bed. I yelled at my poor SO yesterday because he wanted to leave a little early for dinner, and I just needed 10 more minutes to lay down. I am not a yeller by any means, and I scared myself. I catch myself swirling around self-defeating thoughts. I haven't felt this down in years, and my regular remedies are not working.
I guess what I'm asking is, does it get better? Or is this something where I should go back to my doctor and start the medication madness again? What has helped you to cheer the fuck up and get yourself together?
You all have been an immense inspiration, thank you in advance.

I've made the decision to quit. 

I've currently smoked my last cigarette in this pack. I've been smoking for 8 years, nearly a pack a day for the last 5. I've wanted to do this for a long time, and this subreddit has really given me motivation! So I wanted to say thanks, and also ask...how hard is this going to be? And if there are any physical side effects? Also what are some tips and tricks that helped you all quit?

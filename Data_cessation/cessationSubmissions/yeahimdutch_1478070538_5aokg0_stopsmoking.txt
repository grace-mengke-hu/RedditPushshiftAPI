Day 3 and sleep like shit

Hi guys!

I'm on day 3 today and the last 2 nights I couldn't sleep very well. Waking up in sweat every 2 hours and so and having trouble getting asleep again.

Other times I quit I was perfectly able to sleep so this is new for me.

Not quitting quitting today! I won't smoke.

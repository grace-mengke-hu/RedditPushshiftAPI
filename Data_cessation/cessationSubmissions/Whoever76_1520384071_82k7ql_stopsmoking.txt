I'm scared that if I stop, I'll be depressed and feel like I'm missing out.

I'm a very rational 11 year smoker of a pack a day. I know the risks, the effects, the chemical process of smoking and quitting. I know that if I stop I'll go on a massive low, duly expected with the decline happy neuro-juices. And that's what terrifies me. As much as I can wrap my head around why it's so bad to smoke, I don't know how I can cope with the anxiety and depression that follow. Everyone and everything assures me that it's a temporary state, but in all my wanting to understand the process even better, my brain is locked into thinking that it'll be the end of me if I stop. What if I do actually miss it? Do you guys miss it? How did you reprogram yourself? 

Is the difficulty in quitting in the mindset? I've got 5 attempts to date and I can honestly say that the cravings are much easier to deal with than I expected, physically. But not mentally.

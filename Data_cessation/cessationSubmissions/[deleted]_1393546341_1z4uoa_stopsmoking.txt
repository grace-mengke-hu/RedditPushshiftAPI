The time to quit has come for me, any advice?

I have smoked for 4 maybe 5 years and I just wanna stop, I am tired of going out every 20 minuets to smoke. You guys have heard it all before, I will be finishing what I have left (only a couple) and start my journey tonight or tomorrow. 

What are somethings that help in the first few days and how do I stop my self from walking next door to my CVS (less then 300 feet from my house) and buying a pack.

relapsed after 3 weeks. struggling to find the motivation to go again

So on the 11th December I decided I finally had enough of smoking. Quitting was surprisingly easy,  I had really bad cravings when I was drunk or stressed after a family argument, but apart from that it wasnt too bad. Anyway, I made the fatal error about 2 weeks in of having a cigarette when I was drunk in the pub. It really devalued all the progress I had made so a week later I started smoking again daily. 

Ive been smoking for 3 days now solidly but I refuse to go back to it so ive decided to quit again. Ive learnt me lesson that it really is fatal to have just a single puff because it devalues all the progress youve made so Im posting on here as a personal marker to myself, lets do this.

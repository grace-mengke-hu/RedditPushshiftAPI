11 days no nicotine, then I relapsed. 4 days without nicotine, and then I relapsed. Please help?

Both my parents are chain smokers, both my brothers and my sisters are too. Not just smokers, but hardcore smokers. I went 11 days without smoking (when I was at 11 days, my boyfriend was at about 21 days, hes quitting too). We live together, I went to visit my family last weekend, and I smoked the whole weekend :( I had a few beers and it made me crave smoking so I relapsed and smoked like two packs that weekend. Ive noticed a pattern on here that people who are quitting smoking will have a few drinks and then it makes them smoke. Ive decided to not drink for a few weeks/months, at least until my cravings for nicotine subside. This morning my boyfriend went out of state with his family for a trip, here I am all alone for five days and what did I do? I bought a pack of cigarettes and a six pack of beer. Im really upset with myself. I told myself that Ill smoke these until he comes back, and then quit all over again. We live together and Im worried that he'll get suspicious that my cravings will be starting up all over again, but under no circumstance can I tell him that I smoked again, he'll be so angry at me. I really need some encouragement right now. Should I just throw the pack away? He and I dont drink often so I was looking forward to drinking while he was gone, but I know that if I do, Ill smoke the rest of these cigarettes. But I know that when he gets back, I wont be drinking for a few months on my road to quitting nicotine (I really want to quit badly, Ive been smoking since I was 16 and Im 24 now and I just want to be done for good so badly) but I kind of want to have this one last "hoorah!". What do you guys think? I feel really bad right now

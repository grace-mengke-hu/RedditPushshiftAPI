Relapsed and feeling super down

Long time lurker, first ever reddit post. I finally made an account for this since I’m struggling pretty hard right now.

I’ve tried quitting about a million times in the 11 years I smoked for. The longest was almost 3 months back in 2013. I was doing really well but went out for drinks, smoked, didn’t feel addicted so thought I could have a smoke “once in awhile”. You know the story. My second longest attemp was this one. Quit at the end of February. Went on a trip a couple of weeks ago to a couple countries where everyone seemed to smoke/it’s fine to do at restaurants and such. So I had some drinks and smoked. Chalked it up to a slip up that didn’t really count. Well I got back 3 days ago and today, I bought a pack and smoked about 7. I tossed it but I am feeling so shitty physically and mentally just thinking of how I failed again.

I’m feeling so discouraged because even though I feel like shit right now, I know soon enough I’ll forget how awful this feels and be tempted again. I don’t wanna be stuck in this neverending loop :(

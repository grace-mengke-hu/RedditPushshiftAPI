Marking one week of sobriety and no cigarettes!

And I'm pretty excited about it!

I quit smoking this past summer for about five months but had a lapse when my bicycle derailleur broke one night and was stuck in my old ways again.  I had always coupled drinking and smoking, so I've decided to quit drinking until I feel like I can handle it without going for a cigarette.  I can't remember a time when I haven't gone a week, or a day or two without either so it's probably for the best that I am limiting my drinking as well.    

I've already noticed that I'm more focused and not in a "haze" and falling asleep in class any more.  I am already breathing better when I bike, and am looking forward to a smoke-free spring!

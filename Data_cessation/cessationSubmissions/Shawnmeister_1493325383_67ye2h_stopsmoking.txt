Toughest week yet, still not caving in.

I've had dreams of someone that was a huge part of my life for the last 16 years that I cut contact with 3 years ago. Over and over again for the last 2 weeks. 3-5 hours of sleep each time I do. Today, news of a death in the family alongside helping a friend who's depressed and a couple of drinks. I've not caved in. I won't cave in. To everyone who's emotionally drained, the choice is still yours. Don't find a reason to light one up. The only reason to light one up is the reason that'll you regret giving in to.

Just thought I'd share this thought here today and hopefully, it inspires or motivate others in this journey of quitting these death sticks & nicotine.

You got this! (edited this bit in)

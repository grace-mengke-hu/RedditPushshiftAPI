Day 10- Dealing with Regret

Today I had to make a tough decision and was feeling a lot of regret. I was offered an opportunity to work out with a consulting team in BC and would have had to significantly change my life to make it happen. It is the kind of job you dream of but at a time where I wasn't ready to leave everything I've built (A business, full-time job, and long time relationship). 

In essence, I needed a smoke more in an instant than I think I ever have in my life. It was a decision that tore at me for the past week and after 5 days of thinking about it - I declined the offer. However, despite an incredible amount of pressure I did not smoke and despite feeling a lot of guilt I will not smoke. 

It's in these moments where our vices try to pull us back to what is comfortable. Most of all, I am tired of falling to this feeling and want something more out of life. I may have had to decline an offer that meant a lot to me but I will continue to push towards the goals that I started. 

Thank you guys for listening, I needed to get that off my chest and best of luck not smoking today.

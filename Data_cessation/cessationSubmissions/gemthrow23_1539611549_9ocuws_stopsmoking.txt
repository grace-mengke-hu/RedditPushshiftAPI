Cannot get past 12 hours

Pack a day smoker for the past decade. Longest I've ever gone without in that time was 3.5 days. Next was 2. I've tried several times in the last 6 months and I can't get past 12 hours. I very recently purchased a vape so I can consume nicotine. I am still have a tough time with this anytime I try to go cold turkey. Does anyone have any recommendations or tips that could help me through this? Thank you in advance for reading and even considering replying.

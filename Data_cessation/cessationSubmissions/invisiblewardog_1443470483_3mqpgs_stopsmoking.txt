Didn't want to prolong the process

I didn't want to drag it out for another 6 weeks on the patch with the next steps.  So I took it off Saturday and just never put a new one on.

In case anyone wonders...stopping NRT (when you haven't followed the step down plan to completion) hurts just as much as putting down the cigarettes.

Just thought I'd check in.  Thanks for listening, as always.

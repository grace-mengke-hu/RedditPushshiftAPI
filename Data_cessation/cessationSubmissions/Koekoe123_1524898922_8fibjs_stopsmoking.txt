I will stip craving 26F

I started smoking full time around the age of 17, around 10-20 cigarettes a day and stopped smoking on my 26th birthday the 17th of April. The first week was horrible, I was hungry constantly and agitated and I just felt like I was missing out on something (the relax factor when you end your day with a cigarette), and it just felt like I couldn't really take a step bacK and take a deep breath and calm down. I still crave cigarettes every now and then, its definitely better NOW but what really motivates me is I really WANT to stop. I hate smelling like an ashtray, and I hate the fact that I have this idea that I NEED to have cigarettes with me, everything is planned around smoking areas, I cant even properly taste different foods because smoking influences your sense of taste. So I still think of sitting outside with a glass of wine with a cigarette fondly, but I am not going to give up. It has to get better with time.

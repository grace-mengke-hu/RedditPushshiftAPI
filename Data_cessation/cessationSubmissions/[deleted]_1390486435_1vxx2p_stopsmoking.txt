Quitting Day 1

7 years smoker (1 pack every two day)
I tried patches last year, didn't last more than 5 days.
I tried to quit cold turkey style as new year resolution, was able to last 3 days without smoking.

I made my 1st reddit account just for this.
Hopefully these little reddit badges will give me motivation :D

passed the 48 hour mark

thank you for this subreddit, I lurked here for months before finally saying "fuck it" and quitting. I have had a couple moments of anxiety but I am hell bent on never touching a cigarette again. I am actually astonished at how much better I feel, I can breathe so well! we are all stronger than we think. I'll be hanging in here and I hope you're all with me. :)

3rd time quitting...3 days in (more than any other time)

This is really really hard. I'm only at day 3 and every little thing triggers my cravings. I have only 3 weeks of school left and have been fighting myself because I really want to go back to them so I can finish school strong (without having to worry about the cravings and those side effects). This is the hardest thing I've ever had to do. I used be able to manage my stress and frustrations effortlessly, now I "need" a cigarette every time... I'm determined to quit and I will, it's just the cravings are so consuming and tempting. 

Anybody have any tips on what they do to get through the cravings? When it hits, I become functionless; I stop caring about everything, I have no motives or desires. I know it get's better, its just not right now...

I need to stop

Hi guys, just a little back ground. I am a 29 year old female with two beautiful girls. I have been smoking since I was about thirteen. For the last say five years, I have been smoking twenty to thirty a day. Last year I stopped for a month and the first two weeks were really a breeze. At week three the depression set in and that is where my problems started. I am not making excuses and should just have pushed on but I have never in my life been in such a dark place. I was absolutely terrified. I was constantly crying and could not even get out of bed let alone interact with my kids. I was not crying because I wanted to smoke and I could not, I didn't want to smoke and was over the cravings (which was the easiest part). As you can guess, I went through this for two weeks thinking it would get better, it did not and I started again. Depression went away immediately and here I am, a year later and still smoking. I have been experiencing some chest pains lately and I think I have developed severe anxiety of dying as a result from smoking which is very possible for every smoker. I want to stop. I cannot go on like this any longer. I do not want to be such a selfish person that I am willingly killing myself slowly, taking years away from my girls. They need their mother and I want to be there as long as I can. Please help me. Has anyone else gone through the depression? How long did it last and should I seek help for that? Maybe it is an underlying issue I have, I don't know. I just need help. Please.

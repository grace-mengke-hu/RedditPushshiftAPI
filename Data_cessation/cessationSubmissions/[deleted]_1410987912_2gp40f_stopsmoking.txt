I had made it 7 days and then I chainsmoked 10 cigarettes last night. I feel physically awful and mentally defeated.

I quit almost exactly one week ago and it's been going well. I travel a lot and I was in California where nobody smokes so I thought it would be easy. I bought a low nicotine e-cig for emergencies and some nicotine lozenges in case my addiction frustration started affecting me at work. I've been doing pretty well and only using my crutches if I'm drinking or in a very stressful situation - not every day. Last night I just mentally crashed from some stress. I bummed a smoke from somebody (I'm in Fl now), a lousy Capri, and then went and bought a pack. I tried to turn around so many times in the one block I had to walk to do it but I'm oppositional and I fought my better judgment. Then, I got drunk and smoked a shitload. Trying to get back on board today and I threw the rest out.

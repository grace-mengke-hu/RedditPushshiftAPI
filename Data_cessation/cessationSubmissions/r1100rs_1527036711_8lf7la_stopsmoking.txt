Oh hey there 100 days ... you snuck up on me!

And it will happen to you before you know it. 100 days ago, when my fiance and I were driving through the middle of Kansas and he told me "some things you shouldn't plan, some things you just do ... and I think quitting smoking is something you just have to do". That's when it hit me, I had read Allen Carr's book, but that was the moment all the language, the thoughts, the advice, and the guidance coalesced. Just do it.

Yes, I still have quite the journey ahead of me - talking to you 1000+ dayers - but 100 days was a massive goal and milestone for me. 365 is the next. 1000 after that.

For you planners and detail obsessives out there. There is never a good time to quit that you can plan, because the best time is now. Take that, run with it, then plan your milestones and create your goals. Thank you to this sub and everyone who is active here, your quirks and tidbits, and rants and love help me and so many others every single day.

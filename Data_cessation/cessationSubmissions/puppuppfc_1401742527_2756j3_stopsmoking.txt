Can some e-cig users provide some feedback?

I have recently started 'vaping' and been looking into the health implications. To be honest its very difficult to find any unbiased information and everyone either sits on the fence or seems to be under the influence of the tobacco lobbies. 

I know many people here use e-cigarettes and it would be nice to hear your thoughts. Not just on how effective it is as a quitting aid, but on its effect on your health as well. Thanks!

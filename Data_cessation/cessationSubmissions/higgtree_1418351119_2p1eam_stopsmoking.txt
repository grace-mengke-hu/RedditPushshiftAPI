Tonight was my work Christmas party...

I quit back in September.  I smoked for 18 years.... For the first time, after drinking a good amount... I didn't have a cigarette. For me this is a milestone. I'm surrounded by my entire office of smokers. And I deal with not doing it everyday. And the thing I was worried about the most was drinking and wanting a cigarette.  And it didn't happen. Go me!

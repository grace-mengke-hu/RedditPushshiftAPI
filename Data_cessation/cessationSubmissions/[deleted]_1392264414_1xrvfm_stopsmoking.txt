I want to quit but...

I am full of the but's.. but: I am leaving for the UK in less then 24 hours to drink, eat pubfood and be with friends I haven't seen in 5 years. last time it was a wedding. I know there is no perfect time, but why is my motivation always highest when its close to impossible to say no to myself. I've tried everything.. read carr's book til it fell apart, electronic cig, patches, inhalers, gum, hypnosis, cold turkey... help please.

Two weeks... and I just lit a cigarette- please help.

I've been completely nicotine free for two weeks and just few minutes ago I've smoked one cig. I'm abnormaly angry at myself right now. I'm curled up in my bed and crying. I was so happy and proud of myself being able to not smoke for two weeks and now I ruined all my progress. I'm so afraid I'll start smoking again. Maybe not today, but within few days and I'll go back to my usual habit. Please give me advice what to do now. I'm in really bad emotional state and dealing with anxiety and bulimia (smoking was the only thing that was helping me and that's why I lit a cigarette today - not excusing, only explaining). I'll be grateful for any advice. Please help me.

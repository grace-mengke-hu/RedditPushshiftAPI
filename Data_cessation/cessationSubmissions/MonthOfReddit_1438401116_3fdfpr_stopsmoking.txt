Hello. I am MonthOfReddit. I come to you first.

Hello everyone.  I am MonthOfReddit.  My goal is to dedicate a month to a specific community for a month learning and interacting with the community.

I have many goals and would like learn about topics such as carpentry, cooking, music, books, and many others.  My first goal is to stop smoking.  It is, so far, the hardest thing I've ever done.

I don't intend to leave you after a month, but my hopes are I can use this first month to set a baseline for what is to come.

I'm not sure how to document things yet, but I will improve over time.

For now, I've got Nicorette.  I like Chantix, but it makes me sick.  Hopefully I'll figure something out this month.  

With your help.

Thanks.

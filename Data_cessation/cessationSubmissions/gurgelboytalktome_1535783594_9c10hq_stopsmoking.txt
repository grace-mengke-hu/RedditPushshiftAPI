filling the habit of the smoking breakes? and any idea how to track progress?

Hey I stopped smoking in the beginning of the year successfully but began again after some nights out. Now I dont drink alcohol anymore or have nights out like that anymore. I dont drink much coffee or take any other substance so Im confident that I can do it this time without a cigarrett for a very long time. Now I know how to get trough the starting phase but I dont really know with what I should fill up the smoking breakes I had/have. Any ideas on that one? Also does someone have an idea on how to track my progress and what goals I can should/can set?

 I mean I begann to track my progress for exercising and it makes the whole thing much more fun and easy, any ideas on how I could transfer it to a system like stopping smoking? Please no apps, I write things down on my own, I normally never open these apps again after I download them and my writen word has so much more value to me than a app :)

Thanks!

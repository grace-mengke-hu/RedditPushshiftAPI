Help me r/stopsmoking, you're my only hope!

So I'm on a road trip with my brothers, I'm a little tipsy and sitting next to my older brother who smokes Marlboro 27s, my old poison of choice. I've texted my friends for support because I have a real "fuck it" attitude today, but most of them have texted back saying something along the lines of, "well, don't do it, but if you do its not a big deal." Which is not the message I need. Please tell me not to break. One cigarette does matter, right?

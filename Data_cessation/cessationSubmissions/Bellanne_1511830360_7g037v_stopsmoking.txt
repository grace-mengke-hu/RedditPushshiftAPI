I need help. I’ve put off quitting so many countless times. I’m so ashamed that I still smoke, that I lie and tell people I quit.

I have been a smoker for about 20 years, and never really quit for more than a day or two. I’m broke, and the brand I smoke are too expensive even if I wasn’t broke. Most of all, the cherry on top of the ashtray is that my mother died of lung cancer almost 7 years ago. I watched her suffer and die before her time, yet for some insane reason I have continued to smoke, knowing full well that it’s a terribly unhealthy and expensive habit. I’m so sick of being a smoker, but I have little or no will power to quit. I think about how horrible it is that I still smoke all the time, and hate myself for not having the courage to quit, yet I continue to light up 15-20 times a day. I want to be free of this habit, because I know it’s killing me and it’s definitely not worth it. I’ve downloaded the Smoke Free app, but keep changing my quit date. I’ve called a quit line where the state offers free gum and patches, only to fail and go back to smoking within a day or two at most. I’m disappointed in myself, and hate all the sneaking around and hiding and lying (mostly because I’m well into adulthood and it’s silly to lie about my own choices; however horrible they may be). I know that quitting takes time, but I really really want to be on that path by or before the beginning of January, which is the 7th anniversary of my mom’s death. If anyone here can help me make a plan, hold me accountable, or something of that nature, I think that might be my first step to successfully quitting. I really need help. (This is my very first post on reddit, so bear with me if there’s something I should have done differently.)

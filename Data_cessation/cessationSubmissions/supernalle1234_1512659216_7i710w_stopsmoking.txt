Anxiety/Depression sufferers who quit smoking

Hi guys and gals!
I have been wrestling with depression and ridiculous anxiety the last year or so. It recently dawned on me to try googling smoking/chewing and mental health. And man, there was a lot of information out there.... That quitting smoking could be really good for me in the long run. (Short term maybe not so much).

I always knew that caffeine and anxiety were not the best mix but never knew anything about nicotine effects.

Can anyone in here chime in and throw some more fuel to the fire?
Anyones anxiety/depression react positively to quitting the nic?

Oh and I also have GERD/Reflux which is not making anxiety any easier.

Over and out! Hope to hear some great anecdotes! 

Keep on not smoking folks!


EDIT: Oh and I have tried quit this shit for what feels like a million times already. But you know that in the short term it messes you up. Damn.

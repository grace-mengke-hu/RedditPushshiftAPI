28 days later

I'm in 28 days!! That's the most I've ever gone without smoking since I started smoking. Thank to everyone here for support and congrats to everyone dedicating themselves to quit. Today I was awfully grumpy though. I felt myself getting tense very easily and then it would go away. But just for those few seconds were annoying to me. Anyone else have the same problem?

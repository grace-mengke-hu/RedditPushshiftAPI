Nearing the end of day 1 and struggling.

Like the title says I will hit the 24hr mark in 10 mins, it may not seem much but I'm already struggling. I never considered myself a smoker because I would only ever have one every few days, but it started creeping up on me and for the last 2 months I'd be doing a 10 pack a day. As I never saw myself as a smoker I never saw myself as addicted, realising it yesterday though was a game changer, it finally hit me I was a smoker. Thats when I knew that I've got to nip it in the bud now before I get worse as I have a addictive personality.

Now that its coming up to a day its getting hard, Ive got a massive essay in for tuesday, and I'm shaking a little bit, pressures on at the moment and this is exactly when I'd have a fag, but instead of doing so I decided to post here. I'm determined to see it through, I know at lot of you guys will have smoked for a lot longer and would smoked at lot more, but these cravings are pretty brutal. Anyway as soon as it turns midnight in 10 minutes (GMT) I will have done that first day.

After 6 months!... back to day 0.

I could say a million excuses, but in the the it means the same : I got back to smoking. One occasional  became nearly an entire pack on 1 day within 3 weeks. I could say it was "just a slip", "I was stupid", "I was stressed"...  but in the end the excuse I give myself does not mean anything : I gotta quit again. This is a fight I lost, but it's not the end of the war. For many reasons, my motivation in general was low these past 2 months, these things happens. "It's not the end of the world to fall down, but it's a sin not to get up".

Back on the journey tomorrow, Nov 18. Cheers! Also have to work on my weight again which I did not care enough lately, doing more exercise, drinking less alcohol and spending less money in fastfood/restaurants/bars. Gotta take back my life into my control! Only one thing can change our life : our perspective. That's how I quit for 6 months in the first place, that's how I lost weight, that's how I was more confident with women, that's how I had an amazing summer : motivation, confidence, positive thinking. This is a wake up call, gotta do something.

Let's do this brothers and sisters! Woop woop!

Hey there everyone, 

I haven't smoked since last Sunday afternoon (Yay!).  Been taking nicotine gum everyday since, but I have to say I feel like I've wasted all the time I've spent getting over not smoking due to the fact that I'm still getting nicotine from the gum. AND, even despite still using the gum, my mind WOULD NOT shut up about cigarettes yesterday.  Nicotine - WE ARE DONE.

Guys, I'm going in - after 10 years of a ~pack a day, it is time to cold turkey today.  Wish me luck!

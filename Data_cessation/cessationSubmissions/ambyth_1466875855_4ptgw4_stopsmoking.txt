Day 2, out drinking, the temptation is hard but I'm doing it!

Hey guys. Brief history, smoker for 7 years, have attempted to quit around 5 times. Severely asthmatic and hate being addicted after reading and failing Allen Carr. Trying the cold turkey method at the moment and using other redditors strategies! Only on day 2 but going well so far, feeling positive. 

At this very moment I am out for drinks whilst watching the football, would like to know your reasons/strategies for not smoking when drinking? 

One of the best things is being able to stay inside the bar/pub instead of having to go out to satisfy that craving. Currently the bf is smoking outside but am resisting and have even been outside with him without smoking, but the smell has made me cough and hasn't tempted me. It's kind of nice to see the cigarette go down in size whilst others are smoking and knowing that's all there is to it , and seeing that I have resisted it for its 'lifespan' and I can do it. 

Hopefully it'll get easier, any tactics from you guys, especially when you're under the influence?

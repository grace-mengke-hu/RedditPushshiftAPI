Smoked 10 years and now i have been free for 238 days!

I was desperate.
I had to get free from the shackles of slavery.
The slavery of abstinency.

This sub helped me quit when i was at my lowest, i want to thank you all so very much for saving my life.
I Will never take another puff.
That is my vow to all of you.

Thank you

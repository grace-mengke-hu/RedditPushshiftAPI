How I quit - 6 weeks, has been easy, have tested myself, no desire or hard days.

Hi! Many of you will be thinking 6 weeks isn't so long, but I can feel it. This is it. Life is changed. I will never smoke again, and now I know how I managed to reach this point, I'm surprised it isn't taught to people more often.

The first thing you will see is that I used an aid. It helped, a lot, for the initial few weeks, but the period where I actually got the willpower and stopped was what got me over the line. It was all my state of mind, and I'm surprised how easy it was from then onwards.

Here's the combination of things that worked for me.


 * About three months ago, I started taking Champix (Chantix in US). There's a lot of suicides linked to it, but if you know it's a risk and have no mental health issues, you should be able to watch your moods and see if anything is out of the ordinary. I know several people who have taken it and none reported anything other than a few fun dreams (attention whores have written stories about demons crawling up walls etc- I call bullshit, the craziest I had was giving cunnilingus to my virgin ex girlfriend on a public bus full of people). It certainly made smoking less enjoyable. It was like taking the mask off the demon and showing me what he really is. Once you take away the pleasure of nicotine, the reward of serotonin your brain gives you artificially, thinking you've given yourself a treat, you realise it's a horrible thing to do. Chantix/pix helps with that. I took it for almost four weeks out of eight that I was allowed to get free- then I stopped. 

 * I had already started reading Alan Carr's easy way to stop smoking. A very good book. I didn't actually finish it, so if I ever go back I will only have myself to blame, but it helps you develop the required mindset.
I realised during this period and over the coming weeks that it is not as addictive as everyone makes it out to be. Next time you are craving a cigarette, stop yourself right there and think about it. You really want it, why? What makes you want it? Do you really? What do you want from it? What is it going to do for you? How do you think it will make you feel? You are imagining you will feel like a heroin addict shooting up. That's not what you get in reality though. Think about that, and if/when you do have a smoke, make sure you are thinking about this- what you imagine it will do for you and what you expect it will really do. When you suck that first drag down, taste the crap in your mouth and throat, feel your lungs getting that dirty dusty feeling, the stench on your breath and hands, and the mild head-rush that isn't even enjoyable, you will realise- this is shit. It's like ordering a steak-burger and getting a cold toasted sandwich with luncheon meat. And a lot of the desire is you telling yourself you need it. Think your way out of that, tell yourself what it will do to you, and how it's not going to give you the pleasure you were looking for. Then have one anyway. You will be disgusted at it and realise what a terrible thing it is to do to yourself, and that is where you cross the line into being able to quit.

 * The disappointment doesn't stop there. How do you feel about yourself after you've had you've had one? If you've not had one in three days, a week, two weeks, and now you are caving in, how do you feel about that? I bet you feel guilty and disappointed in yourself. You're a failure. You are weak. This reinforces your bullshit belief that you are not stronger than the power of the addiction. Truth is, it's all in your head. You think you are more addicted than you really are. This was the breakthrough for me. When I realised that this "addiction" is more a social and mental reinforcement than a physical one. It's like the bad guy who isn't invincible, but everyone is scared to challenge him. Or the picket fence that anyone can jump over, but it creates a massive psychological barrier that stops people just walking into yards. The addiction is only about a tenth as strong as you think it is.


 * Then there are the logical aspects. Reasons to continue, vs reasons to stop. There are no reasons to continue, and dozens to stop. Seriously, your mental state will try to convince you that you need it for this or that reason. You will try to justify it, or rationalise it. But those are all lies, mind tricks you are playing on yourself.


 * "It helps me lose weight by suppressing my appetite". Bullshit! It helps you GAIN weight by making you UNFIT! It makes you feel crap, weak, it reduces your oxygen intake which makes you less energetic and easier to become tired. This stops you burning calories. It reduces the likelihood of you going for a walk, a hike, a swim, joining in any kind of energetic activity. People everywhere will tell you, when you quit, take up some kind of exercise. Don't throw yourself into it like mad, just add it to your weekly schedule. I found there was a great reserve just 5mins around the corner with walking tracks that can vary from 15 mins to a couple of hours. I will hit them three times a week before/after work for about an hour each time, it makes me feel alive! I also do rock climbing once a week for the upper body. I've maintained my actual weight, but had two people (who didn't know I'd quit) comment that I've lost weight. I guess I've shed fat and gained some muscle?


 * Quit drinking alcohol. Seriously, it will make all the difference and you don't need alcohol. They tell us it's healthy in moderation, but studies have shown that the percentage of people who drink in moderation is so small as to make it negligible as a benefit to society. It does more harm to society than good, by a very, very large margin. Ecstasy and LSD are better for you. Quitting booze and cigs in tandem has made a big difference to me, for the better. Finacially, healthwise, clarity of mind, workwise, organisation and management of my life, and in my relationships with people.


 * Set yourself rewards for goals. I calculated how much I had saved after two weeks, and then spent half that money on a nice new pair of trainers I saw on sale. Two weeks later, I spent half what I had saved that fortnight (on not drinking and smoking) on a 64GB MicroSD for my phone. Something I had wanted since I bought the phone 8 months ago. Then last weekend the Mrs and I went to a theatre show as my latest reward to myself. My next reward is to take us away for a weekend camping.

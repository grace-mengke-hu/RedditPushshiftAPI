A little over 5 months since my last cigarette. Today was hard.

Thanksgiving is usually not a very unstressful time around my family. We're rather large, loud, obnoxious, and can sometimes piss each other off. When things get rowdy, I usually would take that time and step outside with some of my cousins and grab a smoke.

My first mistake was repeating that habit and going outside with them a few times. Since I had quit, cigarettes smelled horrible to me. But today, those things smelled REALLY good.

Thankfully this subreddit introduced me to Easy Way. I don't think I would have gotten through today without realizing that the cigarettes smelled good because my brain was associating the cigarettes with destressing myself during the holiday. I also had a pretty rough time with withdrawals (physical and mental) when I quit, and my only saving grace was knowing I never want to go through that again. Still wrestling with my brain trying to stop thinking about cigarettes, but all is well.

So, on a day meant for giving thanks here in the U.S. ....Thank you r/stopsmoking! 5 months and still going strong!

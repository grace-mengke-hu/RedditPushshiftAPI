Quitting while living with smokers.

I live with 2 smokers, and today when I woke up and didn't have cigarettes, so I decided I won't take that trip to the gas station to get them. And that I'm done feeling like crap. I'm training for a 5k and I can't do my best while smoking. 



How hard is it to quit when everyone smokes around me? I asked if they wanted to quit, and they said, "Not ready for that yet." I have zero support for not smoking. I've been doing it for 4 years and ,y family doesn't know so I don't have someone to tell me, "Good job!" 




It's been 3 hours since I woke up. It's already really hard.

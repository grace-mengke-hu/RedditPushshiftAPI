Stopped and stretched after a run in a place I would've smoked before

Just wanted to share a nice moment with you - especially those just beginning.

Today I was coming back from a "run" (more like a series of alternating short runs and walks), and before I entered my building, I stopped to stretch in one of the places I would've been smoking just a few months ago. When I realized that I actually stopped my music for a bit and took a minute to acknowledge the progress I'd made. 

Just a few months ago I would've been smoking 15-20 a day and I definitely wouldn't have been running. I am in the process of accomplishing two things I wanted that I didn't think were very easy: to stop smoking and start exercising. 

There are good days and bad days - too many of the latter, and I hardly ever feel like I've achieved as much as I could have. But even on a bad day, it feels good to think, "well, at least I stopped smoking" :))

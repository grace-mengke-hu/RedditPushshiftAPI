See that person graduate

Hi everyone

My dad passed away from oral cancer on June 29th at 4:30am. He was a strong willed man. He always did things his way and would make sure to do it right. He pushed himself as much as he could to get better but unfortunately there was nothing he could do. The cancer got to large and chocked him in his sleep. The last three months watching my dad fade were a nightmare. He was in a huge amount of pain the entire time and would be holding his head constantly. Every week when I visited him you could see him losing hope and the disease taking over.

The night he went into a coma I was the last person he talked to. He looked me dead in the eyes and cried and told me, "I won't get to see you graduate". Those were his final words. He slipped into a coma ten minutes later and died a day later. 

The earlier you stop the better. My dad smoked for 35 years and drank almost every night. He went cold turkey on both and he always told me that was the hardest thing to do. I know it's hard, but it's worth it. If not for you, then at least so one day you can see someone you love graduate

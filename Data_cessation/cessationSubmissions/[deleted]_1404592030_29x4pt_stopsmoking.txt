Anyone know of any inspirational quit-smoking documentaries, speeches, or movies?

I quit smoking 5 years ago. I would like to become a quit smoking coach and give speeches on the topic. I haven't found anyone else who does that (except [Joel Spitzer](https://www.youtube.com/user/joelspitz)...who is amazing!)

If you know of any documentaries, presentations or other spoken-word videos on smoking that I can use for inspiration, please send them my way!

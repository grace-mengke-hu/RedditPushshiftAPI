Tingling/restlessness in feet and hands since quitting smoking 36 hours ago and on 21 mg of the patch

I quit smoking Sunday 230am CST. I immediately put a patch on, and have been experiencing restless feet and tingling in my hands. It feels like my feet want to constantly move, and moving them relieves the symptoms. If I'm stilling still it feels like something is crawling under my skin. It's annoying and aggravating. It is giving me anxiety, and the anxiety is making it worse. This feeling also used to happen to me when I was going to bed as a child. Way before I started smoking. I'm also on 20 mg of lexipro daily and have been for a little more then 3 weeks. Is this tingling/restlessness/something crawling under my skin normal? When will it go away? Has anyone else experienced it? What did you do to stop it/get tis of the symptoms?

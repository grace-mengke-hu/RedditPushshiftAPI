Nocturnal Anxiety Attacks?

Almost at two entire days of quitting, everything is going great, except when I'm trying to sleep, I'm constantly awoken withy extreme feelings of anxiety.  I'm fine for the entire day, but bedtime seems to really be a struggle.  I toss and turn all night, feeling incredibly worried and nauseaous.  Is this normal withdrawal symptoms?

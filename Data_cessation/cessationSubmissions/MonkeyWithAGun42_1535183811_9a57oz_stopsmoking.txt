[2 months, 1 day] fuck man why did this get so hard all of a sudden

I am currently sitting here with a cigarette from my brand in front of me, unlit, i've read all of the Easy Way and I still don't know what to do, I just feel like just a quick puff will be alright, remind me why I never liked these damn things, but I know that's the cigarette talking...

What do I do? I know i'll feel such pain and regret if I do smoke this disease ridden coffin nail, but somehow even with all the chemicals released and the benefits and negatives clearly stated I still want to stick this into my stupid mouth and inhale cancer, help??

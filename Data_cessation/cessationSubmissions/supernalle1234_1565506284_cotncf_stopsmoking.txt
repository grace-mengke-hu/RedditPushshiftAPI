Smoking and brainfog/sleepiness

Did any of you have a problem with brainfog or daytime sleepiness when you were smoking?
I'm going to quit smoking from now on and hope that my fatigue is because of cigarettes/snus use.
I quit caffeine a few months ago and feeling a whole lot better anxiety wise.
The fatigue though is the same as it has been for the last year or so..

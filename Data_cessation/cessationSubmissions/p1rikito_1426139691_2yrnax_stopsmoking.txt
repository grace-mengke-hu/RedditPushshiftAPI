Just finished easy way, i am a non smoker!

Hi, i am 29, and was a smoker for 14 years, until a week ago i had no hope on quiting, then i came across this subreddit and found out about the Allen Carr book, as i was reading it, it all made sense, and i finally finished today, it may seem foolish but i can confidently say that i will never smoke another cigarette in my life.

The reason of this post is to thank this sub and Allen Carr.

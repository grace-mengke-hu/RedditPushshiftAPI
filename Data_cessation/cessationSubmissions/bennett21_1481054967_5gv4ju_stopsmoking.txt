Just finished work on day 1 with the patch!

I'm a pack a day smoker that works in a warehouse with smokers. I have been coughing/gagging  and feeling like shit and not even enjoying my smokes any more, so I decided to quit with the patch. 

My first day has been rough. The drive into work, "morning" smoke with the boys, after lunch, and drive home were difficult but I was able to pull through by packing my lunch and eating some fruit/veggies I brought( which I never do) while they went out which seemed to help.

Anyway I'm home now taking the dog for a walk now and think I'm in the clear.

My question is if the patch is as useful a tool as I'm thinking, because I don't think I can go cold turkey. Any feedback from people who have quit on the patch or failed and have pointers would be helpful.

Also, is there any apps you have found useful? 

Thanks

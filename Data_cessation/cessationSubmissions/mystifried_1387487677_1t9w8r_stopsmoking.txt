Clearing out the ol' pipes

Does anyone have any tips for clearing out the lungs/chest/throat after stopping smoking?  I sound and feel like someone should use one of those plastic drain snakes on me.  It's incredibly annoying. 

I've researched briefly and it seems like there may be some varieties of tea that are helpful.  Maybe just use cold medicine or something?  

Any advice appreciated!

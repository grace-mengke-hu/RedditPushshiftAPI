I'm 20 and I've been smoking for 4 years

I don't smoke much, only around 5 cigarettes a day, but even that small volume adds up over time. That's approximately  7,280 in total, and I'm not even legally old enough to drink yet. I want to stop before it slowly gets worse and worse, but it's hard to think of it as such a bad thing when "I really don't smoke that much". What would you have said to yourself when you were in my position that might have helped you then?

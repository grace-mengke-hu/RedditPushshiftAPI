3 months and counting

I was blessed with son on 09/22 and since then I been smoke free, been smoking for 8 years roughly around 15-16 ciggs a day and this was my first attempt to quit.  I had myself prepared for the day mentally, started reading Allen Carr's as I knew I had to quit but was not able to finish. But been following the subreddit closely which has been source of inspiration for me. I am just paranoid by reading about some people relapsing after such long time which just scares me.

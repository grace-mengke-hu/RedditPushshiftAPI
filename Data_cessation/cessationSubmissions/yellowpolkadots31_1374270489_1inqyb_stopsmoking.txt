Advice for a young person who wants to quit.

Hey, I'm a 23 year old recent college grad and I am determined to quit smoking. I started smoking when I turned 21, I work on film sets for a living and it was always an excuse to take a break, everyone smokes on film sets, then I would start smoking casually when drinking with friends, then it gradually got worse with the stress from school and relationships. But now that I'm graduated from college, I of course am very broke, feel like crap all of the time, all that stuff. I always told myself that I wouldn't smoke forever, I would quit in a few years, well that time has come. 

I really just want some advice, I'm trying the electronic cig route, I'm not a huge fan of the menthol ones cause they make me cough, but menthol is what I usually smoked. It's been almost 24 hours since I had my last cig and my appetite is definitely coming back, that was always a huge issue as a smoker, I was just never hungry. I'm really trying not to gain weight, I know that's a huge issue with quitting. I feel like the hardest part will be on sets and when I go out drinking as I have slight anxiety and cigarettes have always calmed me down, which is why I'm trying the electronic cigs.

Any suggestions? Anyone have a favorite brand of electronic cigs, nothing to expensive as I am pretty broke at the moment.

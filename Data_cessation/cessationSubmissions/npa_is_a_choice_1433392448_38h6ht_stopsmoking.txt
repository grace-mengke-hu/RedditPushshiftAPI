Falling off the wagon

I quit two years ago. Recently I've been under a lot of stress and after work one day I bummed one off a co-worker. I told myself it was a one off thing, but it wasn't. It's been about one a week and that's the only good thing about this. Time to get back on that horse.

I'm not writing this for sympathy and I don't need people bashing on me for my mistakes. I know what I did wrong and I'm ready to change. Here's to quitting. Again.

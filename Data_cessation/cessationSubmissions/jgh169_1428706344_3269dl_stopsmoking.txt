Quit date is 2 weeks from today

So, I know this is pretty early, but I thought I'd post on here anyways and try to mentally prepare myself.
 
Due to health reasons, I've decided to quit smoking. I manage  a restaurant and smoke 2.5 - 3 packs per day. I've tried to quit before, both cold turkey and vaporizer, and it went terribly. 
 
My doctor prescribed Wellbutrin for me to help with the cravings, and today was the first day of taking it. 
 
I'm just hoping people can either give me tips or their own experiences on Wellbutrin.

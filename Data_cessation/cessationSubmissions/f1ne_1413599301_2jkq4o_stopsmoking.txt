1 month, 4 hours

I am still coughing up a tiny bit of crap that I don't think would be normal for a non-smoker. My skin is better. The past week and a half or so, I've had only tiny cravings. I went on a date last night with a guy who doesn't smoke and I was SO happy to not smell like smoke during it, or to have to do that awkward "do you mind if I have a cigarette quick" thing before he drove me home!

Last night was funny actually, our waitress was away for a bit and then came back into the room and starting cleaning and started cleaning a table on the other side of it. We were the only three people in the room. I could smell that she had recently gone out for a smoke. I have some sort of super smelling power!

I gained a little bit of weight, I think, but my diet hasn't really changed except I've been buying myself a $3.17 slice of pizza everyday for lunch, compared to my old $1.44 lunch of a Clif bar and yogurt. Even with doing that, I'm still saving money compared to smoking. But I'm still going to cut that out now, I've sort of been doing that as a "quit-smoking" treat to myself.

Anyway, 1 month, 4 hours and I feel lovely. 8o)

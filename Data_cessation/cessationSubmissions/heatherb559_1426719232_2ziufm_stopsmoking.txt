This post is my smoke free homework. What is working for me and why.

Mints... Specifically life savers individually packaged mints. Love to tear into the little packages with my teeth. I buy huge bags of them and eat the hell out of them.
NRT... Specifically the patches. I went from vaping 54 mg... Yes 54 is correct. 8 hrs a day at work. And smoking 2 1/2 pks per day. Yes the and is correct. The 21 mg patch wasn't enough to keep me from drifting from a fog to panic attacks back to the fog again. However, I'm 18 days in and I haven't gotten fired or gone to jail. That is success!
Breathing thru it.
Both the cravings and the panic attacks. Deep breaths. Sometimes I inhale and exhale as if I were smoking a cig. This helps immensely. 
Think about it logically.
Asking myself... Would this situation be any less stressful/frustrating/heartbreaking if it had occurred when I was a smoker?
Fantasy
I fantasize about the CEO's of tobacco conglomerates. Their lives, personalities, etc... Let me tell you they are the worst scum sucking... No they are the scum that is sucked by the scum that is sucked by the scum suckers. They are the maggots of society. They flourish from our pain, suffering, and death and they target our children to replace us after we taken our last puff. I have no trouble getting mad at them. Fuck them!
Last but certainly not least...
This awesome page right here. I live in a smoking world. Here is where I come to know that I'm not alone. That there is a big non smoking world out there. That in all my craziness I'm really mostly normal. Shit, I love you guys!

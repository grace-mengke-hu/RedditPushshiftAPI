"I could die tomorrow..."

"You know, non-smokers die too!" "Why stop doing something you enjoy when life is so short?" "I could die tomorrow." "I don't want to live until my 60s anyway, imagine being old and miserable."

The nicotine monster inside our brain is smarter than you think. Those are all strong arguments it creates to fight our rational brain. But we are smarter.

EVEN if I knew the world was going to end tomorrow, the last thing I would do is to buy a pack. Like any other person who isn't a drug addicted, I don't associate cigarettes with pleasure. They aren't a boost, a reward. They taste awful, even as a pack a day smoker I knew that. There was the just the illusion of some cigarettes tasting better than others, which were the ones I had to wait the longest. Remember that time you quit for a couple of days or weeks, and then smoked again? That's when you feel really proud of yourself, puffing away something that tastes absolutely disgusting.


If there was only a day left to live, I wouldn't waste a single second on that drug. There isn't anything pleasurable in it. At least alcohol and hard drugs, although not healthy, give some measurable sensation to our system. But the only thing a cigarette does is diseases, bad breath, an awful smell, tainted fingers and teeth, and a bad cough. I wouldn't spend my last moments alive going back to the prison cell I managed to escape, going back to the lowest point of my life, being addicted to something as awful as nicotine and cigarettes.


Here's to fresh air and freedom, everyone.

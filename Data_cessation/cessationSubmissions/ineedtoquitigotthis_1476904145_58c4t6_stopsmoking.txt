Smoked my last cigarette a few hrs ago..

Hey guys,
my names Antoine and i've been trying my very best to stop smoking cigarettes the last few years.
I've been smoking for 2 years and I think it's time to quit now for good.
I've quit for several months before and felt awesome but once I smoke one cigarette on an event it leads to ATLEAST 3 months of full smoking. It's time to stop for good. I won't touch that nasty poison anymore and i'm conscious that one will lead to another. I'm joining in the party. Great subreddit by the way :) - ill keep you updated!

Erection issues due to smoking;Quitting!!!

Caution : Adult post!
Hi everyone. Ive been smoking for the last 18 years or so. 1 or 1.5 packs a day ðŸ˜”. For the last 3/4 years ive been facing problems in my sexual dept alongwith general deterioating health. Low energy, feeling shit all the time, fatigue ,labored breathing etc. 
I WANT TO QUIT ONCE AND FOR ALL!!!
I want to know how soon my general health will improve (i know that some damages cant be repaired).
Sometimes I take alot of time getting hard which triggers a cycle where im thinking "oh its not getting up...again" and i go limp. This happens 3/4 times out of 10. Even if it gets up, its hard enough for penetration, but i can feel that its not hard to its full potential. Secondly, it takes alot of effort for me to get aroused that too is somehow related to not getting up easily. I miss my youth days erections ( when i was quite new to smoking, and i get aroused easily and my erections were hard as wood). Im also getting less and less moening woods now where in the past i used to wake up everyday supporting one. I have decided to quit cold turkey, ive read tons of material on quitting and feel that im well equipped to kick this demon ( I suggest everyone to read Allan Carr's easy way to quit smoking). As of yesterday ive started 15-20 mins brisk walk. Now the questions;
1. Will i get better in my erection and arousal areas?
2. How soon  can i expect to see results?
3. Please share your positive stories regarding your erections and arousal improvement, if you want to, so i know that there is some light at the end of the tunnel.
Ill be here and will read up for motivation whenever thrs a craving....i know i can defeat it!! 
P.S : its not porn induced, ive quit watching porn a long time ago.

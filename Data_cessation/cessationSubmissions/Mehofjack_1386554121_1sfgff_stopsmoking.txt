After numerous failed attempts to wean myself off nicotine, I am quitting cold one week from today. Need suggestions!

Pretty much as the title states. I have tried 3 different times to wean myself off of nicotine (the longest lasting 1 month @ only 2 cigs a day) and I constantly fall back into the hole. So, I have come to the conclusion that I am going to just say fuck it and quit. I'm sick of being tired and drained and sick all the time. I am also done screwing around with different procedures and methods on how to best wean myself off. I've been mentally preparing myself most of this semester for the day I stop, which will be the Sunday after finals are over. I am here, really, just looking for suggestions as to how I can better keep my mind off cigs. I know the habitual element will be my largest obstacle, but I did just move into a new apartment and I have been working on not creating habits that satisfy smoking. Any help is much appreciated!!!

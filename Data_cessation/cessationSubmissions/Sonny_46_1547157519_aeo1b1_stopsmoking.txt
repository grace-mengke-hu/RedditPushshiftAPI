5 days...and first party coming up this week end

Yep, 5 days right now. After 20 years of it. Feeling like many of the other people posting here. Mixed feelings, hard and rewarding at the same time. Need to keep excitement up and dont forget why we do it, as with time the pulsions that triggered to stop fade away and that is the risk! This is doable.
Anyways, Saturday is our first party of the year... drinks are going to put that will to test!

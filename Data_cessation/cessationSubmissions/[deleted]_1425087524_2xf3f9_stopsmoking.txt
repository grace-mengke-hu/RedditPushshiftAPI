The craving monster is here! Oh this is as bad as it's been!

OK, it's bad. So so so bad.  I won't fill you with all my excuses to smoke but...if I were to smoke, I'll just end up at the start with my lungs again, hacking and coughing and being miserable with cravings and attitude issues, right?  So not worth it.

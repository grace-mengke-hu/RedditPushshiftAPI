Got a sign yesterday...

I was at work, and decided to go for a walk where I normally would go for a cigarette. I thought to myself, "hey, the worst that could happen is I'll get some fresh air - hell, maybe I'll even find some money lying on the ground!". Sure 'nuff, I found a $20 bill not 5 minutes into my walk.

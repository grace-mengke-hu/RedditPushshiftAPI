Day 18 - Everything just settles in

Hey everyone,

So it has officially been 18 days since my last smoke and I can say it just feels like a normal day. No major cravings, issues or milestones to report. For me at this early stage in things that feels like a real blessing.

When you start this whole journey whether cold turkey or with help- you struggle to just get through the first few days. It settles into a general sense of irritability and for almost two weeks straight I didn't feel like myself. You start to miss that feeling that you can calmly engage with the world around you.

So I hope today is boring in a sense and leaves not much to ponder on quitting smoking. It will be a refreshing change of pace.

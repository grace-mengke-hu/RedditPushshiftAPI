Day Two: Replacing the ritual....and preparing for other things

Yesterday I posted about smoking being a ritual for me. 
Today I decided to replace the ritual. When I got up I put on tea instead of coffee. I drank my tea outside where I would normally have a coffee and smoke. I made myself stay outside as long as it would have taken me to smoke. It worked for now!

Other things: I know from past experiences that one of my discomforts in quitting is constipation. Seriously, because I cut out or down on coffee too, I can feel my regularity change. This time I am taking a daily stool softener! 

When I craved today, I purposely tongued around my mouth to enjoy the freshness and remind myself that typically after I go a couple days without smoking the first one is so disgusting and I regret the aftertaste in my mouth. 

Additionally - I downloaded a couple quit smoking apps and am committing to checking in on here everyday. I figured it will be helpful to fill my mind with anti-smoking/ pro-quit-smoking messages to help combat my desire to just go enjoy one.

nicotine and processed sugar- tackle 2 related addictions at once or in order?

just fell back into smoking after 2 months quit due to just going "fuck it" & losing all motivation around my 21st birthday. also been yoyoing back and forth as far as my disordered eating, between periods of severe restriction and binging, mainly on stuff containing processed sugar, which as we all know is highly addictive as well.

just read about how cigarettes give an immediate boost of blood sugar, which makes sense given how out of control I felt with sugar in the 2 months quit.

anyway, since it's gotten to a really low point for me with both these things and I feel like a sack of crap, I want to quit both, don't know what order to do it in or whether to do it simultaneously, how to go about it etc. anyone been in the same situation?

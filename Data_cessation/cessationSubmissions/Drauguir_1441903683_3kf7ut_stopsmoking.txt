Quitting cigarrettes and depression/anxiety

It's been 1 year since I had a major anxiety breakdown with depression, so I have been since then taking medication. All has been kind of fine and my mood has improved a lot.

Ok, to the point. Since I quit smoking 35 days ago, I've noticed that, specially 5 days from now, started feeling an euphoria-nervous feeling. Could it be that the anti-depressant now is feeling stronger than before because I quit smoking? 
I'm kind of scared it could evolve into anxiety, that's why I'm writing that now.

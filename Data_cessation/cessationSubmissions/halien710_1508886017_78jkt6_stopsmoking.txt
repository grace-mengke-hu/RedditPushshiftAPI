Need some encouragement

Hey guys. I’ve got 2 weeks and 2 days under my belt. Things have been going really good for the most part. Yesterday I forgot my charger for my Juul, I had the opportunity to smoke a cigarette and  reluctantly declined. It’s weird. I really want to have another cig but I also REALLY don’t.  Anyways I was struggling all day. Moody. Anxious. Then I went to talk with my good friend and was really let down when she didn’t show any support. I told her how I almost had one and had been having cravings the last few days. Her response was “do you want one?” And I told her I’m really serious about quitting. She responded “ oh lol I thought you broke  already” 
Idk. I just needed to vent. I’m really upset about that. Because if the roles were shifted. I’d be more supportive and not offer someone who’s struggling one of their vices. 
still haven’t had a cigarette. Just taking it all one day at a time!

Day 13 - Depressed and insomnia?

Hi guys. I'm on day 13 of stopping smoking. I'm starting to get really worried about my "withdrawal" or if it even is withdrawal.. I smoked for 6 months between 4-7 cigarettes a day. The first week of quitting I had bad anxiety which would be almost a constant thing, unless I was preoccupied (like being out with friends or doing something) however, the anxiety improved after like 8 days. But since day 8 I've been experiencing really bad depression. I'm not even sure why, but it's just like I don't feel like doing anything, my appetite has gone to shit ( I thought stopping smoking was supposed to increase appetite?!) And I've been waking up like 4 times each night feeling almost panicky. I really don't understand if this is still nicotine withdrawals because I thought they were supposed to be pretty much gone by day 14, but I'm on day 13 and I feel like shit still. Has anyone had a similar experience to this? Or should I go to the doctor because this is really making me worried like their may be another problem at hand. Wouldn't make much sense though because before quitting I had no history of depression, anxiety or anything of the sought - and I started smoking only 6 months ago so it can't have been covering something else up.

“Relapsed” and More In Tune

I stopped smoking cigarettes in January of this year because I got strep throat and it made cigarette smoke smell absolutely awful when it used to smell great to me. I wasn’t vaping or getting any nicotine for a while but did end vaping because people around me were so I got back into the nicotine side of the addiction. I didn’t smoke cigarettes though at all because if I went weeks without smoking due to strep and nothing bad happened, then I could/should not go back down the rabbit hole. 

Last night I went to a concert and took some drags from other people’s cigarettes because I was drinking and you know how it goes.

Now I feel even more sure that I don’t need to smoke ever again. I gained nothing from smoking a bit last night (probably equated to 3 or 4 cigarettes of random drags throughout the night). I woke up and my mouth didn’t taste goo, my teeth looked stained, and I had such a strong realization that I don’t want to smoke and have no need to anymore. 

I feel like I will never become addicted to cigarettes again now. Vaping nicotine is sort of a different story, but I do hope to let go of that habit too. I’m so proud of everyone in this sub that’s stayed strong, and I hope all of our lungs learn to breathe as they should again. Best of luck to you all.

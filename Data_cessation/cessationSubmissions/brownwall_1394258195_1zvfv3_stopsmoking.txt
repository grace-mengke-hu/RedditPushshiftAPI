Ulcers Suck

I quit fifteen days ago, now my mouth is full of ulcers and my throat hurts terribly on one side. Cursory browsing showed that this is expected after 2 weeks after quitting. 
Did you guys go through this as well? It seems like the severity of this depends on how heavy of a smoker you were earlier. (5 years, a pack a day for me.)

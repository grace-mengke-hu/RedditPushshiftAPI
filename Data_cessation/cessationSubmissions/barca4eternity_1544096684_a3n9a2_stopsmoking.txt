Explain to a non-smoker.

I know this might not be the appropriate place to ask this. But almost everyone in this sub has smoked, I wanted to know how does it feel to smoke. Sometimes I get tempted to smoke when I see my friends smoking. I know itâ€™s bad. But I wanna know the feeling. I am 21 years old btw.

Do you guys think your anxiety gets better after u quitting smoking?

Im already hooked but just let my 4 packs that i bought today in the trash! 30 Bucks on the trash but all good better for me.
When i stopped for 2 months my anxiety was really better and i was running and playing basketball like crazy i was breathing really good.
Whats your thoughs? Opinions ?
Im stopping this time for good. 
I use opiates thats why i smoke a Lot cause its a good combo but i Will stay Just with opiates and no other drugs.
Cant smoke weed cause i get paranoid / anxiety attacks.
So thats my goal..Hope u guys dont judge me for my opiate use .. i use Just codeine.
Thanks for reading.

First time smoke-free for more than 48 hours in 20 years.

Been easier than I thought, sure it hasn't been easy but still easier than I thought. Heard the 3rd day is usually the worst, I'll find out tomorrow. What finally made me quit was basically this phrase "Stop putting toxic shit in your body, it's fucking stupid". It's just so fucking simple at the end of the day.

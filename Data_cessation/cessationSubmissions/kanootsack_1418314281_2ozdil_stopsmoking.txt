When you have a craving, think of putting the cigarette out and visualize the butt.

I realized it is easier to think about finishing the cigarette than it is to think about lighting up. Especially if you can remember those feelings of regret and wishful thinking (to quit) that often are had at the end of the cigarette. Good luck to all! Day 6 today and I feel better than ever!

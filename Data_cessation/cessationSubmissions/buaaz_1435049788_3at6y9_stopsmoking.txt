I Just Read EASYWAY

Allan Carr really hit the nail on the head. After being recommended it by friends;and practically all ex-smokers on the internet, I gave it a go. I ended up reading the entire book in one sitting and it really changed my perspective on smoking.

I agreed with pretty much all Carr had to say in the book, and saw myself in many of the scenarios and examples that he used.

I started my escape from the chains of smoke using NRT - only two days of a patch but NRT none the less. After reading EASYWAY I will not be going back to NRT. 

I keep reminding myself of one simple truth; I'm not giving up anything. I'm not quitting. I'm simply giving myself a tonne of benefits that I can enjoy each and every day.

I was going to end this with something about staying strong, but I won't. Instead, I'll end by saying read the damn book if you haven't, and remember: there is nothing to quit.

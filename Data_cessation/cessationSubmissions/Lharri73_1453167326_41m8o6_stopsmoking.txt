14 days in and depression is bad

I have quit now for 14 days, after smoking for 24 years.
I have quit for my kids, who are finally old enough to nag me and tell me (rightfully so) that smoking will kill me. The irony is, I am only alive for them. If it weren't for them, depression would have killed me long ago.
In the past I have suffered from major depression but over the last few years I had got it under control, even enjoying the last year with a happy and positive attitude about life.
Since I have quit though, I focused my energy on getting through the nicotine withdrawal symptoms, not realizing that the biggest hurdle would be the return of an all consuming and dangerous depression. 
This weekend, my boys were with their dad and I could have bought a pack of smokes (they would never have known I had cheated). I didn't though and struggled all weekend with an internal dialogue, Angel and devil on my shoulder.... "Buy one, don't buy one, smoke and feel happy again, don't smoke, see how far you've come"

I am going to make an appt to see my doctor. I didn't use Chantix to quit because of the danger of use if you have a history of depression. I've heard zyban is good for depression symptoms but I am very much against medicine to treat depression. I came off a strong anti depressant 8 years ago and have slowly felt better by working on my thoughts and journaling. 
But, there's something that messes with your brain when you quit smoking. I am hopeful the sysmtpms will pass but an entire weekend crying and thinking about dying has got to be worse than smoking!

Today is the day

I had four cigarettes today. After 20 years of a pack a day—at least—and this was my last pack I've been on Chantix for 6 days. Bought nicotine lozenges at Costco. I have all sorts of hard candies and plenty of gum. Feels like I'm stocked and ready for winter.

I'm not telling anyone but my partner for now. Kinda like with a pregnancy, I don't want to tell a bunch of folks in case there's a failure of some kind. 

My partner is super supportive. Not having others to talk to, however...well, I have a feeling that that's going to suck. So I typed my educated guess into the reddit URL and found this group. Your words, as a whole, are already providing comfort. 

I may lurk more than I should, but I wanted to thank you all, for today and in advance, for being around and sharing your experience. 

[Omg, I'm so emotional. Maybe it's male menopause.]

Now I'm gonna seek out some of the resources I've seen mentioned here. 

Wish me luck!

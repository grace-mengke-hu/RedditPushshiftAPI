I finally decided I wanted to quit, and it feels great...

I smoked for over ten years. I had loved ones, ex-girlfriends, family members, ect, always tell me I should quit, and make snide comments about smoking. I never listened to them, and valued the romance I had with my addiction more than anything else (hence the ex-girlfriends). 

I am a Creative Director, and rely on my thoughts and creative mind to make money. For as long as I can remember, that has been my mental crutch. I convinced myself that my ideas might die with my cigarettes. Most of the best ideas I've had were during a "brainstorming smoke". The reality is, I was smoking so much, almost every thought I had involved smoking. Point is, it only took me a couple of days to break through the barrier I was afraid of for almost a decade.

I'm only a week in, but I finally put them down, and won't pick them back up. I tried vaping many times, and hated it. I would just end up buying a pack after the stupid coils would burn out. This time, I quit cold turkey. 

I have a half a pack sitting in my bedroom, and I haven't touched them for a week. I might leave them as a token of pride every time I walk past them. My friends asked me why I didn't run water through them, or *dramatically* flush them down the toilet. I can always goto the store and buy another pack if I wanted. For me it adds to the accomplishment that they are so readily available. 

I joined this sub about six months ago without the intention of actually quitting. I was just kind of curious of the struggles. Little did I know, it would slowly inspire me to just completely stop.

If anyone is out there struggling right now, it can be tough. All I can say is, you won't quit until you really want to. Good Luck everyone, and thank you guys. 

**TL;DR - I guess I joined the club now, and I went on a rant about it.**

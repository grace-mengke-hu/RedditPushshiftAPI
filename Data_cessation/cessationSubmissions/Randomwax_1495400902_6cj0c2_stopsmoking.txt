1000 cigarettes not smoked

Hey guys, 
Yeah! I just hit 1000 cigarettes not smoked in 34 days!
(Smoked 30 a day).

Now I've taken my 2 14mg patches off on Saturday and am vaping. (Gone from 18mg to 3mg vaping over the last month)
I'm a bit light headed and anxious is that from vaping or could it be withdrawal from the patches? 

I  also take 20mg Ritalin 3x a day
Thanks!

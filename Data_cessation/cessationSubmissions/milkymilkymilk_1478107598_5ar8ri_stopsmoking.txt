Quitting cold turkey and cest congestion

Whenever I attempt to quit smoking cold turkey I experience chest congestion and difficulty breathing.. Not the day after I quit probably like a week after... this seems to go away if I smoke a cigarette again.. why is this happening and does it stop? any ways to make it stop faster? thanks

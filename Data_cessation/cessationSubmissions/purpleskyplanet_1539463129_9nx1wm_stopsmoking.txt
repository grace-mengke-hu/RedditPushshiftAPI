How do i get my guy to stop smoking without coming off controlling?

My boyfriend is a "heavy" smoker and has been for about 12 years. I have been a "light" smoker for about 8. We've been talking about cutting back for a few months, and last week I finally decided to try to stop all together. He is still going at it. 

I don't want to sound hypocritical or controlling, but I truly hate that he smokes so heavily. I have a hard time bringing it up to him though; his responses are always very defensive. I understand that he's not going to quit until he is ready. But how do I nudge him in that direction without being a nuisance? I don't want to die before him ðŸ¤·

Trying to quit again - cold turkey.

So, I tried the whole no smoking October thing a few months back and failed miserably, ended up accepting a cigarette from a friend who could see I was having pretty bad withdrawals after about 4 days. 

Skip to yesterday, and after several "discussions" with myself, I decide that after my pack is smoked, I will stop because it's really not doing wonders for my health, and I almost hate the feeling of that first cigerette, the rush almost knocks me over and leaves me not feeling well for an hour or two. A few hours ago I finished that pack - now I just need to keep it up, wish me luck reddit.

This time there's no going back

So I just finished reading Allen Carr's book and I fully agree with the content on every point he makes. 

This stuff is absolutely useless and it's ridiculous that I kept doing it so long, I even stopped for 8 months about a year ago and went back to smoking despite of knowing it's a horrible idea.

So this time, there's no going back. I don't need those sticks that do nothing but making me sick, miserable and attack my self-confidence. 

The leftover nicotine in my brain is already trying to trick me back into it, but this time, I know better...

Thanks for this sub, I'm sure it will be a major factor in keeping my head up, guys!

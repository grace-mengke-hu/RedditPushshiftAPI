I just shot down the biggest craving I've ever had

I even rolled one and went outside, I walked around for a bit, I even put it in my mouth... But after 15 mins, I threw it in the river. Christ. Mad huge craving. I just had an argument with the GF, luckily I manned up at the last second, I knew what that fag would of done for me, I knew I would of felt NOTHING, expect guilt, disappointment and after an hour, the feeling of wanting more. 48 hours and counting...

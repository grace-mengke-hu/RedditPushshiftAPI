Hi! Been a veery long time since I was last here, was going through my post history and wanted to check on my flair, pretty nice.

4 years without nicotine, still hate smoke when I'm walking behind someone who's smoking, doesn't make me want a cig just smells and feels nasty. Can't remember the last time I had a craving, or a dream about smoking. This sub helped me a lot when I was thinking about quitting, is "the book" still popular? I used it and it helped me so much in the start. Hope you all make it :)

If you want someone to talk to about quitting, hit me up.

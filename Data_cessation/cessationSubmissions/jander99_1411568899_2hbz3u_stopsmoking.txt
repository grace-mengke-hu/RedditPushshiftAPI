Almost 4 weeks, nose stopped up. Warning: gross details.

Sorry for the grossness of this.  The last week or two I've had to blow my nose alot more often.  And by blow my nose I'm having to do it one nostril at a time, and sometimes pick a little.  What's coming out is sticky and more often than not bloody.   I'm having to do this more than three times a day on average.  Once I can get my nose clear I can breath very well, until it gets filled up again.  

Has anyone else experienced this, either to my level of needing to clear or worse? I want to know if this is normal or if I need to bother my doctor about it and get an appointment with a ENT specialist.

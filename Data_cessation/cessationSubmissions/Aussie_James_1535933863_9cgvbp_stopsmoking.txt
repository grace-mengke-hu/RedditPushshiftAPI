Day 3

I still have a chest infection, but hey I'm actually happy because there is no way id be having a cigarette!!!

just ate some raw ginger, and have been eating more passion fruit for vitamins.

The headache I had on day one is gone, and I'am less fidgety  today. The plan is to leave the library soon , head home and watch a movie!  i will not smoke with you today!

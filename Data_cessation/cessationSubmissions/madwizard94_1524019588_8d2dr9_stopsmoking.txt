passed the 3 week mark. any suggestions?

hello, I haven't smoked in 22 days!!! I recently read Allen Carr's easy way and learned that it takes 21 days for the nicotine to leave your body. Now i don't know if that's true or not, but I figured it would be a great mark.

i still haven't given up marijuana yet (honestly i think i'm using it to fill the void of smoking :/)
but the cold turkeyness of quitting nicotine has not been unbearable like I expected.
I guess I'm wondering, for those of you who have reached this point, do the cravings ever come back? what should I be wary of?

Tomorrow is my quit date. I'm 29 with hypertension...

This is my millionth time attempting to quit, all through my 20's I've struggled with smoking, there's actually not much I like about smoking, the smell disgusts me, the taste is horrendous, the cost keeps going up, I constantly have phlegm in my throat, I can't smell anymore, and my nose constantly is plugged up. 

I'm a male/29 with hypertension. My blood pressure most days is 152/70.  My cholesterol is close to 200 at my last physical. I'm going to  be 30 in May and at anytime I could suffer a heart attack or stroke. I should be at the pinnacle of my health, with years ahead of me. Instead due to smoking and poor lifestyle choices I'm about as healthy as a 70 year old. 

I've always said I'm quitting before I'm 30 and I'm ready. I'm posting this as a warning to those younger that yes the effects of smoking can and will creep on you fast and as reminder to myself. This is why I am quitting. 30 going on 70 or with a little hard work and determination I can be 30 going on 30.  

I'm ready to quit!

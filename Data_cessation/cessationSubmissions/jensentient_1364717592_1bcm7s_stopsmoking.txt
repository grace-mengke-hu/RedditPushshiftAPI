didn't flush them

i'm taking a year off of smoking, just as an exercise of willpower.  my only goal for this year is that i don't have a single puff during 2013.   i've nearly done it before, but every three months or so i'd slip up.  i'm three months and some change in now (started 22 december to get my momentum going), and i think i've got it licked.

time was, i'd either try to quit at the end of a pack or flush/throw away the remainder.

this time, i have half a pack.  sitting next to my bed.  with matches on top.  and i always carry a lighter.

my reasoning was this: not having cigarettes doesn't make you a nonsmoker.  smokers run out of cigarettes all the time!  but a nonsmoker could have a hundred cartons in their bedroom closet and not bat an eye.

i'm consciously keeping in close proximity between myself and my addiction in the vein of "keep your friends close and your enemies closer."

you have to.

cigarettes are ubiquitous.  every gas station, grocery store, and hell, even other smokers on the street (which is why i carry the lighter) are a potential source.  if you try to run away from them, they will invariably find you.

it's tempting to take a wrestling metaphor here ("maintaining a chokehold" or something), but i'd tweak it to say "i cuddle up to my addiction."

How can I kick the habit after smoking for just a couple weeks?

Congrats to all of you guys who are year+ smokers that are able to work on quitting!

As for me, I've smoked cigarettes on and off for a while. Two years ago, I would smoke maybe just a cigarette or two during drinking/a social occasion but I don't think I was ever fully inhaling so it wasn't a big deal for me. 

However, for the past month or so, I've been smoking quite a bit more. I've been stressed with a lot of things in my life, so I bought a pack with the intentions of just smoking a couple at night to relax, but instead...

I started smoking 2-3 cigarettes a day. Which is a lot for me. In the month or so I've been smoking, I've probably gone through 2 packs and I'm scared as hell that this is gonna be a big habit (parents are 3-+ year smokers). I can go a couple days without any, but then I start craving them. I'm a marijuana smoker and I haven't had access to some 4/20 during this period so it was another reason I was grabbing for a cigarette.

I know I've only been smoking for about a month, but I want to quit now before I get myself in deeper shit, especially since my lungs have been feeling "heavy" after intense workouts. I've got a bit of an addictive personality so I don't know how to approach this. HELP?

After 8 and a half months, I slipped up.

I started college recently (at 26), where a lot of people are smoking. I also deal with depression quite often. It's been pretty bad lately. I've been thinking about smoking a lot. I've been having very real dreams about it too. Two nights ago, I got pretty drunk and decided to have one. One turned into a few. I know I don't want to smoke again but its hard to when I'm feeling down. This sucks.

Disappointed

I had nearly given up cold turkey for three weeks and last night was my first night out having drinks with a friend, when I caved and bought a packet.. got drunk and smoked them all! I am so very disappointed in myself, but I do want to stop! I had an internal battle when purchasing them "it's only for tonight,  I can stop tomorrow" But now I know I'm back to square one, that the nicotine is in my body! I feel awful! Can anyone give me some advice please? I was doing so well!

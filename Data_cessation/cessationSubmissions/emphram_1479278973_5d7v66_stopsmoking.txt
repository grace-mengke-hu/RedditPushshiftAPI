Starting my 5th day...

Hello, first post, decided to find a group.

After 9 years (current age 26) and various health problems that all started thanks to smoking... I think I may have finally quit. This isn't my first attempt, but I sure hope it will be my last.

I've had cravings sporadically, but not as bad as in past attempts. Tried using e-cig but I found it to be burdensome and decided to ditch it some hours ago.

I've been to several doctors, but they say its withdrawal symptoms (like I said, this isn't my first attempt). I will get random pains in my chest (either side), usually before coughing up a large blotch of phlegm. Anyone have any insight?

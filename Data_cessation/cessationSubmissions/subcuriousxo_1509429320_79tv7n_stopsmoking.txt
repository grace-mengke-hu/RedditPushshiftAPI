Don’t Throw Your Whole Quit Away Just Because You Fell Off The Wagon

My history: I smoked for a decade with my first quit six years in. That lasted barely two years before starting up again, only to quit a second time at age 30. I started smoking again at 32 for another two years before what I thought was my last and final quit at 34. 



Since I’m here writing about not throwing your entire quit away it’s clear that that last quit did not stick. I am, however, super glad that I’m here after 28 days of smoking and not after 2 or 28 years of smoking again. 



I’m 3 days in and even on the very last day I tried to rationalize not quitting - “It’d only been four weeks,  one more day, week etc wouldn’t matter.” “I wasn’t really a smoker if it took me a week to get through a pack (I was a half pack to a pack a day at my worst.)” “I can quit whenever I want to.” (Not!) 



Anyway I just wanted to say, if you are like me and are on your nth quit, don’t give up. Just because you started smoking again doesn’t mean you have to commit a few more years to the habit. I always made the mistake of thinking I’m screwed anyway, why not keep smoking? And so it goes, a year would pass, and then another... 



This time round however, I’m hoping to do things differently - it’s much clearer to me that I tend to go back to smoking whenever something stressful is going on in my life. The last couple of times it’s been bad work situations and this time round it’s been a bad relationship. None of this excuses why I started smoking again but it’s definitely a red flag that I need to figure out how to manage my stress in a healthier, body positive way :) 


So glad to be here, thanks for having me!

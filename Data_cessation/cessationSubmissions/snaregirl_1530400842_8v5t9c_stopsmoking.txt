My last cigarette was June 20th, first smoke free day June 21. Tonight I had a trial that made me nervous, this is how it went.

Hey!  
My quit is going well still, and tonight was the first time since I gave up cigarettes that I a) drank alcohol and b) was out on the town with everyone around me drinking and/or smoking. I was a bit apprehensive and made a plan beforehand with my friend: we would keep it light, and if the temptation was too much, we´d leave.   
We sat outside at this quaint place in the middle of the old town, and other people sitting around us were smoking. I sort of thought at first that it didn´t smell bad, and then I did a visualization exercise where I saw myself light a cigarette and inhale the smoke; and to my surprise I could not visualize a positive experience with smoking. That´s when I told my friend that I was good, and wouldn´t need any special considerations.  


Twice during the evening I was placed into a position where I had to say: "No, I don´t smoke." That was strange and wonderful. As amazing as that might sound, I didn´t miss smoking, nor did I keep thinking about it either. Before I quit, people would tell me that it was all the matter of hearing that right "click" in your brain, and then it would happen, quitting would be easy - and I believed them, in theory. Now I know for myself. 

In case anyone is wondering, I have been smoking for 32 years, since I was a young teenager, a child, around 15 cigarettes a day. For many, many years I was certain I could never quit, because being a smoker was a part of my identity, meaning, impossible to change. Today it is self-evident that smoking isn´t who I am, it´s just that dumbass, compulsive thing that I´ve been doing since from before I knew any better.

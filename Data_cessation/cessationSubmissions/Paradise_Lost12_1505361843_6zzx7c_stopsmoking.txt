The One Obstacle I Can't Move Past

I've smoked for 4-5ish years now. I made the decision to quit back in August, after finding out my girlfriend was pregnant. So the motivation to quit is there, and I've been trying incredibly hard to do it.  Even now I've gone from roughly a pack a day, to a 20 pack lasting almost 3 days.

Longest I've gone is 4 days, I don't use any aids, once I run out I say "that's it". Around the house I can occupy myself enough that I don't even notice that much.

Then I go to work, which wouldn't be so bad if we didn't sell cigarettes and cigars. It's a convenience store, which means I don't have coworkers, so I rely on customers and menial tasks. If I don't have those, I'll buy individual cigars, but eventually it just becomes another pack. We're not allowed books or any sort of entertainment, which really limits my distractions that I have available.

The accessibility of them is what's my downfall, I can't hide from my job until I'm over it. I know if I can figure this out, it's an easy stretch from there. Just looking for some sort of advice, even leaving my cash/debit card at home doesn't always work, as there's usually a few small tips here and there. I want to be completely past this by January, and I need some advice on how to deal with this part.

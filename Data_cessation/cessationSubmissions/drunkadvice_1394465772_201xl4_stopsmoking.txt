I fed the monster...

Two or three weeks ago I was drinking with some friends, one of them had some Nicotine Gum.  I figured "Ahh, what the hell?" and had a piece.  Towards the end of my Quit, I enjoyed the gum more than cigarettes.

Last weekend, same friend, same thing...  This weekend, that friend was not around.  I was craving a whole cigarette SOO bad!!  I asked my wife for one, and she said "No way! Are you serious? because if you are, I'll give you one."  I had the strength to say "No, don't you EVER give me one if I ask!".  Later I ended up stealing one from her pack and putting it in my pocket.  Smoking it when she wasn't around.

I'm not counting this as a complete badge-resetting failure.  But it's a reminder that I (and anyone reading this) need to stay diligent!  No nicotine means NO GODDAMNED NICOTINE!  After 4 months of success, a small decision set off a chain of events that lead to sneaking "just one".  I have to make the choice to stop this chain now, before it goes any further.

Stay motivated!  No matter how many days you have, it's easy to start the chain again.

Thoughts on Hooka

I know that it will be different for each individual, but what is everyone's thoughts on Hooka after quitting?

I am a huge Hooka fan i.e. 2 collectors hookas at $200 a pop, I go crazy for accessories and flavors from different companies, etc.

Right now, I'm in China so I dont have the hooka, but I will be returning to the U.S. at the end of the week.

Does hooka make it easy to fall back into the routine of a smoker? Is there enough nicotine to get you 'rehooked'?

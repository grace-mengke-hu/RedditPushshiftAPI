Any artist smokers out there?

I relapsed tonight after 22 days cold turkey. As an artist, I get creative late at night after a few drinks and I realized that the nicotine is what kept me up and energized at night to paint/draw. I’m finally doing artwork again and I’m just realizing the integral role that cigarettes played in keeping me up at night to keep me going. Anyone have/had this problem? I’m still proud of myself because I know I will wake up and NOT want to go back to my every-day-all-the-time chain smoking extravaganza, but this is a very particular challenge to overcome. How do I approach this next time? Alcohol makes me uninhibited and cigarettes give me the energy.  That makes for the perfect creative drive. Without smokes I’m tired, and I go to bed at a decent hour, I live and work like a normal person but you can throw my lonely, late-night creativity bursts out the window. Art is one of the few things that I value highly in my life and creativity doesn’t come easy for me. But of course I want to kick this awful, nasty habit. In addition I have been severely depressed since I quit but that’s for another post/conversation.  Thanks for reading this.

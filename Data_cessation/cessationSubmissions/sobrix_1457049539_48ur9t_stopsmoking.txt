Quitting smoking enhancing other addictions.

So I quit smoking about 8 days ago or so and ever since I've been trying to keep my mind off of smoking. I run my own company so my day to day life is very stressful with a extra bunch of stress added from my personal life. Smoking was always that one break for me where i could relax and reboot. Now I decided it was time to quit, so instead of smoking, I play poker online. It hasn't gotten to the point where I lose a lot of money, in-fact the opposite; I earn quite a bit of money with it. However, I am concerned that this is causing a gambling addiction for me and so do not think that it is healthy. I would appreciate some input on wether I should continue gambling or not.

Day 1 & my reasons

Day 1. Here are 8 reasons I'm a non smoker. Feedback or additions welcome:

1) Others can moderate their smoking or drinking. I can't. 1 is too many because 10 or 100 isn't enough.

2) I already fucked up my body by drinking too much. Thankfully that's reversible - I'm 5 months sober this Thu. Damage from smoking may not be reversible, may be worse, and I don't want the risk.

3) I enjoy being able to speak all the time/unexpectedly to people, without having to clear my throat first.

4) 1-2 months ago @ the gym I started hacking up gross shit in between sets.  I worked too hard for these gains to torpedo them that way.  Clean lungfulls = better gainz.

5) I have a lot of surfing to enjoy when I'm retired & move to Latin America a few years early from the $$$ I save.

6) Speaking of which: $600/mo = $5000/yr. [NYC FTW!]

7) My colognes rock. I like smelling like them all day long instead of having them (or my sense of smell?  Or both?) obliterated by 10am.

8) I'm already ~10 hrs into nicotine withdrawal. I don't care to repeat it.

Replacements for dopamine fix/how to stabilize brain chemistry?

Has any one found any herbs, foods, activities etc that helped stabilize brain chemistry while getting used to not activating dopamine through tobacco?

I am too afraid to quit smoking because I feel delusionally depressed and have horrible mood swings and PTSD symptoms when I don't smoke tobacco.

Its gotten to the point where I literally keep smoking through lung pain, chronic throat infections, and high blood pressure and spend a lot of energy trying to convince myself that's its OK to smoke, because I am so afraid of the emotions and feelings I experience when I try to quit tobacco. I'm afraid of how my PTSD engages more strongly and I feel paranoid and reactive towards my boyfriend when I quit smoking.

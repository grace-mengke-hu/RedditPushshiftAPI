How do you get yourself to WANT to quit?

I want to want to quit. At this point, it's so ingrained into my routine (and I'm so, so miserable these days, it's been a really fucking rough year) that every cigarette is what I look forward to most each day.  I don't \*want\* to quit yet but I want to want to.  How do you get there?

One year free of cigarettes!

I just noticed that I am at a whole year! Someone else had to point it out to me haha. I'm certainly not the only one celebrating this milestone today. Congratulations to everyone on their successful quits! 

If you're still working on it, know that it is absolutely possible for you as well. I and other quitters are proof of that!

Today was really hard!

I stopped smoking during my holiday and today was my first day of work after 3 weeks. And well, it was really hard. It was a stressfull and long day and my boss was driving me crazy. And there were a few times when I really wanted to smoke so badly, just to have 5 minutes for myself. But I didn't. I kept telling everyone that I stopped smoking and they were so proud and supportive.  So I made it through this day without a cigarette and I am so happy.

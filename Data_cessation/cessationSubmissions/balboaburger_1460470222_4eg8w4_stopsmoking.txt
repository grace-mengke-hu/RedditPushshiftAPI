Decided to quit smoking - need some tips!

Hello everyone, I decided to quit smoking today but I've got no one to talk to so I'll share my story here with you guys.

I'm 17 years old and I'm going to high school, been smoking about half a pack a day for 6 months now. I've always been left out and bullied because of my physical appearance. I've got basically no real friends. I started smoking with other kids at school because it made me feel like I was getting involved in a social group for the first time. I also have a constant ringing noise in my ear (tinnitus) which turned my 2014 and 2015 into a nightmare. (I'm still recovering from the depression).

I had to run to the tobacco shop this morning before the school bus arrived and I had a freaking stroke. My throat ached like crazy for an hour straight. I thought I was dying. And there's a constant feeling of guilt towards my parents who are so protective of me. So, I decided to quit smoking today. I made over 10 attempts (lasted 6 days at most) in the past but this is the most serious one.

This is actually the first time I'm sharing my decision with anyone else so I'm looking forward to hearing your tips about this issue. Thanks a lot.

Edit: An interesting note, I found myself watching 50's cigarette commercials just before I failed at my last attempt. I think my brain is trying to make smoking seem like an innocent thing.

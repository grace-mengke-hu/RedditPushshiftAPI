Asthmatic Smoker, Quitting Now

So I've been smoking for 7 years now. I suffer from a terrible anxiety disorder that was my "excuse" to get on them. As we all know cigarettes are in no way an anxiety reliever long term. In fact they make it worse. 

At this point in my life I was coughing with every single inhale. A standard asthma reaction. Coughing up crap which is also an asthma thing (as well as COPD, ect.) Getting bronchitis every single winter and sometimes in autumn. 

Last weekend I was hit with the flu, a sinus infection, and bronchitis all at once. Despite hacking so hard I was dry heaving from it I still smoked in between said heaving. It was at that point I took a long look at myself. Asthmatic, coughing every hour, out of breath for simple things, so dependent on a toxic chemical. So I decided I was done. Got rid of everything the next day and haven't looked back.

At this point it'll take months to see how much damage I've done to myself; once the time has passed and I've stopped coughing up crap related to quitting and my lungs have healed as much as they're going to . I wouldn't be surprised if I've developed chronic bronchitis even after "only" 7 years. That's a scary thought and it makes me terrified to find out. 

I know a week isn't very long and I can't guarantee I won't relapse but I do know that I'll face a much earlier death than most if I don't stop. I'm terrified of death, terrified of COPD, terrified of a lot of things really. Anxiety walked with me into this and it's coming with me out of it. No point to be made really; just wanted to share my little story.

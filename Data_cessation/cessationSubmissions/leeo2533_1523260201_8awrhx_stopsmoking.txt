Need help to stop smoking

I’ve been trying to quite smoking for the past few months or so. The longest I’ve gone is about 2 weeks. Been on and off for that and decided to go cold turkey since last night. I’ve made it about half a day so far. Been smoking a pack a day before I decided to stop. Heeeeelpppppp!

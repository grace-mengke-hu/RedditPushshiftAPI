A week in...

I'm seven days into quitting now and I can honestly say I don't miss cigarettes at all,but I'm having other issues with the withdrawal. My back seems to really ache at the minute and I have this metallic/bloody taste and smell in my mouth and nose all the time. Is this something anyone else has experienced or should I plan a trip to the doctors to get it checked out?

addiction (word puke/rant)

day 5, the urge is real. writing to take my mind off it.

then i thought, might as well face it and write about it.

please don't mind the ranting =(

---

it sits in a corner dark and cold

void of the light and tales of old

peeping, you watch, as its feet protrude

silently it sits, waiting to intrude

-

eyes so bright like red hot embers

burning and scorching it glares and simmers

it has but one aim, and one aim only

to one day screech and mock your folly

-

it scratches the walls as it waits in slumber

its long claws taunt, will you stumble?

not today, no, you firmly denounce

it cackles and waits, itching to pounce

---


In the dark corner it sits and wait

it's pitch black, and just by gazing at the corner, 

one can feel the drop in temperature

where light dare ventured to the border of the darkness,

 a pair of feet peeped out from within

unkempt, scrawly, yet you can't overlook the sinews and the taut muscles that once were

-

it looks at you with intent

for from that corner that you've banished it to

it is chained but not by steel or vine

but by your own words and a determined mind

stare into the darkness long enough

and you'll see it staring right back at you

a piercing gaze it has

for it's hungry, and you're the only obstacle

like a predator eyeing its prey

you can look, and you will look

for such is the morbid curiosity of man

but do not lock eyes with it

don't fall to its spell and enchantments

for you've come a long way, with a longer way still

now is not the time to fail

-

it'll bide its time and wait

"this phase shall pass" it will say

and soon, you'll grow weak

and start wondering "maybe just once again"

right there and then, it will have won

for into its arms you'll again embrace

please, no, do not sway.

"this too shall pass" you will say

don't stop to wonder "for old times' sake"

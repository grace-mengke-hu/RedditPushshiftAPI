TWO YEARS!

I can remember mornings where in the steamy shower I'd cough and cough and shake my head and think " GOD if I could just make it a week without these things."  I am free of them now.  I took Chantix for around the 3rd try and it finally took.  I had been a smoker for over 30 years.  I wish all of you attempting or considering to quit to try try again and never give up.  The reward is worth it.

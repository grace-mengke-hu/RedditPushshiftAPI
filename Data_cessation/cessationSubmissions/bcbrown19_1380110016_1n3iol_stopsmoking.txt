Starting over from day 1

I fell off the band wagon a while back, and just never updated my badge. I'm headed back home from a TDY and already have my patch on for the flight and everything. 

My reasons are pretty basic - I had an uncle pass away over the summer from cancer, so that makes three relatives on my mom's side who smoked and died from cancer. Trying to avoid that for my daughter. 

2nd reason is for my fitness. Being in the Air Force, I gotta keep up these standards. And now that I am over 30, I am finding it harder to maintain my weight and cardio fitness like I did before. So hopefully quitting long enough to see and feel the benefits will make the last half of my military career easier (in terms of PT anyways). 

I really plan on relying on this subreddit a lot at first. I always do fine until the second week, and then the doubt creeps in and I buckle after a month. 

So here's to another try!

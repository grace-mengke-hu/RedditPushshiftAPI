I caved. But I'm positive

OK.  Last time I checked in I told you I was visiting friends for a drink and one smoked. I made it through this night and I felt so smug. And then....the little one can't hurt voice I bought a pack and smoked 2. I ran the rest under the tap and threw them away. That was Friday.  I smoked again on Sunday.  Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.  I've reset my badge.  

I'm furious.  I was coasting through the quit it was easy I was over the worst of it I really don't know why I did it. 

But now I know I can make two weeks. And that it was easier than I thought.  So just a little but of resilience and repeating that one is never just one. I'm confident I can do this. I really want this to be the time I manage it.  

Good luck everyone. I'll reset my badge later when I can log in from a computer

1 year! Yay!!

So, It's been a year since I stopped and I wanted to post it here :)

I used to smoke around half a pack to a pack a day and I smoked for around 9 years. (I am 22 now)

 I decided to stop cold turkey after watching a Alan Carr youtube video. I've previously tried to stop countless times, but for some reason it stuck this time. 

Honestly, it has been much easier than I thought it'd be! The first two weeks were the hardest, but after them I haven't really thought too much about smoking. 

Now I never really think about it and I don't think I'll have too big a problem carrying on not smoking since smoke kinda grosses me out now. 

Thank you for the support and for being good reading material when I felt like relapsing! You guys are awesome!

 If I can do it, you can do it! You rock!

If anyone needs help, is just starting out or needs a buddy to talk to, please PM me! I can definitely share my experiences and I can always lend an ear to someone needing it.

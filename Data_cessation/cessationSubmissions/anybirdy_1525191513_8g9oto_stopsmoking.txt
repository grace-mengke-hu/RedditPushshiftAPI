Quitting nicotine two weeks before exams, irresponsible?

I stopped smoking cigarettes in January, and moved to vaping. It wasn't hard at all. I lost my vape stick a few days ago and managed to get through one whole day without nicotine \(my head was pulsing all day\), but I've since bought a pack of cigarettes and smoked 5 in the last 2 days.

I don't want to start smoking again, and I don't want to have a crutch anymore, but I have serious exams coming up in 2 weeks, and I'm afraid the side effects of quitting nicotine cold\-turkey will impact how I do.

I'm also afraid that I'm only telling myself that because I don't want to quit, and that if I do bad in exams and I did quit smoking at the same time, I'd just blame the poor results on quitting.

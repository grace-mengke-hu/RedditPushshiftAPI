Just smoked my last cigarette!

Have tried many times before with minimal luck.  Was able to quit for a couple years a decade ago but started back and haven't had much luck since.  I've tried gum, patches, substitution, etc. I finished reading the East Way by Allen Carr last week and put out my final cig minutes ago. Wish me luck!

Help being supportive of my awesome SO while the nicotine monster inside of his head is causing him to be a dickbag

Basically what the title says. My SO and I recently quit smoking together, something that both of us have been wanting to do for a long time (as smokers do.) However, I was more of a casual smoker. I smoked a hell of a lot when I drank and occasionally when I was stressed out, but I have not had any cravings or desire to smoke since we quit 4 days ago. I also haven't had any physical withdrawal symptoms.


He however, was a pack-a-day starting first thing in the am smoker and is in the midst of the worst of the withdrawals, or so I gather from reading about the quitting process online. He says he feels like an asshole, every little thing bothers him, he can't sleep, gets night sweats, and is constantly preoccupied with the idea of getting a pack.  I want to assure him that the worst of that will end in the next 5-10 days or so but he is being very negative about that Idea. 

He hasn't smoked at all or taken nicotine in any form, but I'm worried that if he feels hopeless about these symptoms going away he will eventually cave before they do.

From you fine fellows I would appreciate two things: 1. Any advice you have to offer about how I could be a supportive partner in this time, things your partners did that helped, or things to definitely avoid saying/doing. And 2. Tales from your experiences in the first 2 or 3 weeks of quitting: did the horrible symptoms actually last a long time? What did you do about them? If you caved and smoked one or two what affects did it have on your quitting over all? He is trying to avoid nicotine replacement, as he wants to get off nicotine altogether, so stories related to cold turkey on nicotine will be most relevant.

I Just Started Smoking (1 Pack / 2 Weeks) How Hard Will It Be To Quit Right Now?

Hey everyone i just started smoking and dipping like 2 months ago and im going thru a pack roughly once every 2 weeks but i know it will be very expensive/harmful/hard to quit down the road so im going to try cutting it out entirely now...how hard will it be to quit now vs. after smoking a pack a day?

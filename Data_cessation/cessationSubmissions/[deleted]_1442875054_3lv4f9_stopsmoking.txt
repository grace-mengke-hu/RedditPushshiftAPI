Gearing up for day 1, reading Allen Carrs book.

Like most of you I have been looking for a reason to quit and as we all know there will always be an excuse, but yesterday someone on here shared their story of hopefully not so bad news of after quiting for 2 yr's and it brought me into reality that I am not invincible and smoking will damage and very potentially kill me leaving behind my wife and 3 kids. If that user reads this, a massive thank you for sharing, its 8am here and am reading Allen Carrs book and by 8pm I will be a non smoker!  

Don't wish me luck I believe I won't need it.

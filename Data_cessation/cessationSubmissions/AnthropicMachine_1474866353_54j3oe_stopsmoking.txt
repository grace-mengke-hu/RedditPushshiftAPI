Starting my process to quit

I've never been a big smoker and I've stopped cold in the past for long periods of time so I never thought I would get really addicted, but in the past four months I've been smoking about half a pack per day (generally 13 cigarettes give or take) and I've started to notice more of a regularity to it that I've never really had before. That and the enjoyable benefits of an occasional smoke have started to degrade more into a "I don't really feel like it right now, but I kind of need that hit" feeling. I've always viewed drug addictions from the perspective that it's acceptable so long as I'm comfortable with it and can maintain a beneficial lifestyle. Well, I no longer feel ok with it. So I've decided to quit. I've given myself a 30 day regimen. 10 per day for three days, 9 the next three and so on. Within a month I want to be done with it. This was my first day with 10. So far so good.

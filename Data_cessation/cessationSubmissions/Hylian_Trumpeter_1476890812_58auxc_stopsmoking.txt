Multiple vices that all feed off each other

Smoking, Drinking, and overeating.

These are the unholy trinity of my demise. lol.  I'd love to find a way to tackle one of these at a time without the other jumping through the roof.   I'm choosing to start with quitting smoking first as I have daily discomfort in my chest.  Popping, cracking, snapping around the right side of my sternum and right lung.  Had this shit for years, but I think its mostly due to sitting hunched in an office chair around the clock... But you never know.

So, I ask for tips on removing one vice at a time without the other 2 going through the roof. 

Thanks in advance.

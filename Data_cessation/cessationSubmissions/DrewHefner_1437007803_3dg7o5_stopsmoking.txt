My job is keeping me from quitting. Anyone that has had similar problem; looking for help/suggestions.

Hi all! I've been a smoker for 9 years, started at 19 now 27. I've really been making a go at quitting the past year (serial quitter) and have not been able to make it happen yet. I have read the easyway and like the cold turkey approach the best over e-cigs and patches etc. The most ive gone i believe is 2 weeks. Little background; I'm transitioning into running my family buisness, the general manager is retiring next year and is kinda checking out day by day and passing responsibility off on to me. I still have to keep up with my current duties so I end up working 10-12 hours a day, and i keep so busy that i go all day not smoking at work and its really easy. When i always fail is by the end of my day im so stressed and exhausted that all i can think about doing when i get home is having a couple beers and smoking cigs in my back yard. It's my release. Looking for any help or suggestions from anyone who has had the same kind of issues.

TLDR; my 10-12 hour work days and combined stress of learning how to run a buisness with 50 or so employees has me secret smoking at home by myself. please help!

Thanks!

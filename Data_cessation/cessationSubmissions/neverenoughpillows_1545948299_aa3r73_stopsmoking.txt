Champix side effects

My doctor put me on champix three weeks ago and it’s been a miracle worker. No cravings, no withdrawal. I’ve been smoke free for the last ten days and it’s been wonderful. I passed by someone smoking yesterday and the smell was absolutely revolting.

My problem is that the champix is causing some pretty severe nausea, which only seems to be getting worse. Last night and this morning I found myself vomiting uncontrollably. I’m taking it with food and fluids. I’m gonna go talk to the pharmacist today to see what can be done about it, if anything. I feel so gross right now.

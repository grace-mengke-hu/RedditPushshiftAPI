One year smoke free! (Full disclosure: Still chewing Nicorette gum 2mg; around 7 pieces per day.)

I don't feel great about still using nicotine, but I feel much better physically.  First few months were the worst, but now I don't miss the act of smoking.  Hang in there fellow quitters...it's worth it!  
[EDIT: Smoked for 20 years.  Previous record was 4 months.]

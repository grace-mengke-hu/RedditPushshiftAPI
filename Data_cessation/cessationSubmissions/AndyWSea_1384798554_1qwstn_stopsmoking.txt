So right around the month mark the cravings came back.

I will not smoke, I am not worried about that. I have gone too far to pick up a cigarette again, but has this happened to anyone else? I think it was a few days ago at like day 32. I would just CRAVE them for a while then it would go, and the craving would be back soon after. Urgh. This needs to stop.

Over One Year! Here's what I learned.

I had been looking forward to posting on the day I got my smiley star. Unfortunately, due to a family emergency, I couldn't post on my exact one year date, but this is close enough!

This was an insanely difficult road but oh so worth it! I have told tobacco THOUSANDS of times over the past 368 days that I do not need it, and I will go without it.

I have so much more free time now that I am not locked down by tobacco. I don't have to plan my breaks at work, or worry about clients seeing tobacco in my teeth because I didn't rinse out properly (I would dip at work so I didn't smell).

I have saved over $1500 in tobacco alone this year. Money got tight for a few months, but if I had still been using I would have made my financial situation so much worse.

I still think about tobacco every day, but actual cravings are so few and far between that they don't bother me anymore. When I do get a craving, I tell myself that it will go away in 10 minutes and it always does.

The best thing that quitting taught me was that I CAN DO IT! Because I was able to quit tobacco, I took a good inventory of my life and realized that I was an alcoholic. over 5 months ago, I became determined to become sober and I have stayed sober for 155 days as of today. 

Quitting tobacco gave me the courage to stand up to my other vices.

For those of you who are just starting out on your journey, know that the difficult times are worth it in the long run. As bad as it gets during the first few days (or weeks) it gets infinitely better.

Thank you to this forum for the support, and encouragement. I am so proud to have one full year under my belt, I can't believe how quickly it went. 

I finally got my Smiley Star!

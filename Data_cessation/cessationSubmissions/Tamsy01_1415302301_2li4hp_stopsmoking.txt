18 days and need help.... I'm sad :(

Hi guys. 18 days and pretty much been ok... Bit think I was so pleased with myself and surprised in the beginning, that wow feeling carried me through. I've had two days of dreadful cravings and a monster on my shoulder telling me it wasn't the right time to quit... Give up! I don't want to and I haven't... And I won't... But I'm really sad tonight that I can't smoke... How awful is that really! I've already reminded myself 10 times or more today why I quit and how much better I feel 18 days on.... Yet my mind even tells me I wouldn't mind feeling crap for one smoke.... Just have one.... I won't... But I am sad that I'm sad. Hope I don't feel like this forever! X

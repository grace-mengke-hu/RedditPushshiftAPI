Today is day 4,272!


That’s 11 years, 8 months and 9 days. 

At a conservative estimate of spending say £5 a day on cigarettes (I don’t even know how much they cost now!) I’ve saved £21,360. 

It is literally weird for me to think that I ever used to be a smoker. Whereas before I quit those little tarsticks were my beloved friends. 

It took me 5 attempts to quit but I got there!

Hang in there.

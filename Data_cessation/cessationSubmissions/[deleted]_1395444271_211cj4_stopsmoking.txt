Reaffirming my commitment.

Until last Saturday, I was at about 150 days quit, cold turkey. (13 year pack a day smoker) I had been having no issues, feeling free, exercising regularly, able to drink on weekends without needing to smoke. All good things.

Then I don't know what happened. Last Saturday, I broke down and smoked 3 cigarettes. I don't know. I'm a 31 y/o male in the midst of a divorce, and I've been forced to move in with my father temporarily for financial reasons. I actually hate the man, but that's another story for another subreddit. He smokes inside (like 2 packs a day), and leaves packs laying around all the time. 

So something snapped on Saturday, and I grabbed his pack and smoked 3 cigarettes between the morning and afternoon. 

Then I realized WTF I was doing, and put the pack back. I don't know why or how it happened. It was practically auto-pilot. 

I feel I need to get this down in writing, for personal reasons. I am reaffirming that I am NOT a smoker any longer. What happened on Saturday was an aberration. I did not experience any pleasure from smoking, only guilt, a sore throat and an awful smell on my hands. 

I did reset my badge, in an effort to be honest about this process, but in my head, I still consider November 11th, 2013 as my quit date. Saturday was a bump in the road, but I am glad I got my head out of my ass quickly.  

So, like I said, I just want to record my thoughts on this. Have it in writing - remember the decision I've made and all the amazing things it has already brought to me. 

Hope you all have a good night. Stay strong!

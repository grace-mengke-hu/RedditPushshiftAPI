Nofap and stopsmoking!

After coming back home after finishing college, I started to smoke a lot less, just because of family and my little sister.  Usually, I smoked around a pack a day for around 3 years.  
I had to drive up to school and pick up all my stuff that I left behind and I was so excited to finally be able to smoke as much as I wanted since I've been feening constantly.  When I was driving up to school, I ended up buying 3 packs along the way since packs are MUCH cheaper on the way up.  I ended up smoking a shitload and getting really sick.  So I got back home and decided that I'd quit smoking.  
Then, I happen to see a TEDTALK called The Great Porn Experiment.  So I decided to just quit both smoking and fapping at the same time to better myself... I thought it'd be extremely hard, since I'd constantly be wanting to smoke and fap.  BUT, I actually do not crave a single cigarette now because i'm too preoccupied from the urge to fap...  It's been around 3 weeks now and I'm perfectly fine, except for the random urges I get to fap  once or twice a day.  It's funny how not fapping allowed me quit smoking effortlessly.  

Quitting fapping also helped me quit cigarettes because I kind of made it a habit of smoking every time I had sex and I'm pretty sure if I fap, I'll want a cigarette as well lol.  So basically, if I relapse on one, I'm pretty sure I'll relapse on both!
I recently went out to drink and I always thought that I'd cave in when I was surrounded with my friends that smoke and also alcohol... But, I didn't cave in or crave a cigarette :)

Just a funny story I wanted to share with some of you guys and letting you know that it might be easier to quit two bad addictions at the same time instead of taking it slow, one by one haha.

I was the 372 day caver. Update. 

So I posted here when I caved around 372 days and wanted to do a 2 week update. SCREW TOBACCO. Generally sums up my attitude. I feel amazing. Of course sleeping was hellish the first week and I'm still having some pretty intense craving but when it get really bad I just kinda blurt out "SCREW TOBACCO" in a loud way. I don't care who am with, what I am doing, or where I am. It helps a lot and I don't know why but it actually does take a little of my chest. Now to the motivation part of things. Yesterday was exactly two weeks and one reason I'm going to stay quit happen to me at 7:15 in the morning. Just woke up, still in bed, haven't even stretched yet, and all of the sudden and overwhelming urge to  cough/ clear throat  comes and I can't. Panic for all of 2 seconds and just let out the largestt throat clearing ever. Sounded like a race car to be honest. Now my mouth is filled with lumpy spit. I think to my self... how come it feels like half of my spit is solid? better check that out. Walk to the sink. Plug the drain and let out the nastiest, worst smelling, absolutely vile, black/gray material. I just stood there and thought... Wow... 14 days ago I paid damn near $75 a month to put that shit in my body which would ultimantly ed up costing hundreds of thousands of $$$ in medical bills later down the road. Anyways. Opened up the drain and threw on the molten lava water to ensure It didn't solidify in my plumbing. 

 

 TL;DR: Feel great, Still craving, "SCREW TOBACCO", and really gross stuff is finally coming out of me.

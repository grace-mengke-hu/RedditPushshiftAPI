This is really hard.

 Hey, first post here. First post on Reddit, actually.  I've quit smoking for a year here and a year there. I picked it back up over the summer at a really stressful job. My real problem has always been drinking. Just a waste of money, time and motivation. 2 months sober and that part is going fantastic to be honest. I've gotten physically back into the shape I used to be and I think more clearly now.  But I've been leaning pretty heavily on cigarettes. I know that's common, but I feel like I've just replaced my old habit. I've read some other posts on here and I am a stress smoker. I'm moving across the country soon to a new job with my SO of three years and dealing with all three of those aspects of my life along with adapting to a new sober life has been plenty stressful. Not even sure what I'm looking for here, but it's nice to write it out I guess.  Thanks to anyone for reading.

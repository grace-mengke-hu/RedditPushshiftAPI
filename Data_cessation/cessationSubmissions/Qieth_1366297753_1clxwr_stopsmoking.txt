Help. I feel like I'm slipping.

It's 87 days since I last had a cigarette. It's the longest I've ever gone without smoking since I started 12 years ago. I feel great. I hate the smell of cigarettes. I am passionate about helping others if they ask for it.

But these last few days, I have been wanting a cigarette. I can't stop thinking about it. It's been so easy up until this point, I'm a little scared of what's happening now. 

I've gone through 3 months where I was at risk to lose my job. But I didn't smoke. I lost a girlfriend (sort of) but I didn't smoke. It's been the worst time to quit smoking, but I did it and I stayed away from the cigs. 

But these last few days, I've really wanted to smoke. I can feel it in my lungs. I don't just want the nicotine, because I don't just want to eat a piece of gum. My lungs are screaming for smoke, and that's insane! How do I make it stop?!

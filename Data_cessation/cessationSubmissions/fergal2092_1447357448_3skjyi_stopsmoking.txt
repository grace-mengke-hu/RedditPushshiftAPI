How to give up altogether?

I have managed to cut myself down to less than a pack a week, with if I'm lucky only one a day, maybe 2. But I have been at this stage for months, and every time I try to stop altogether the cravings overwhelm me. How can I go from here and give up altogether? My trigger is stressed and I am currently in Law school so stress is part and parcel, as it will be in my life after. But I really want to kick this habit as I know it will severely damage me. I hope someone here empathizes and can give some useful advice

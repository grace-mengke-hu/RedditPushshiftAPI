Day 20...Tomorrow is Day 1...

Well today I struggled a lot with cravings. I finally gave in. Went to the shop and purchased rolling tobacco and made up a cigarette. I sat with it rolled for a while. And eventually I lit it. And another, and so on. The cigarettes were pretty awful, and I feel quite sick now, with a slight headache. Not that that matters when it comes to nicotine addiction, or any addiction for that matter. 

I have now discarded the tobacco, soaked it in water aswell just in case I get antsy. I listened to a little bit of the Allen Carr EasyWay audiobook, and now, again, consider myself a happy non smoker. :). 

Sadly I fell for the big monsters brainwashing, as the little nicotine monster was nearly dead. But hey ho, tomorrow is another day. Day 1 to be precise. Wish me luck!

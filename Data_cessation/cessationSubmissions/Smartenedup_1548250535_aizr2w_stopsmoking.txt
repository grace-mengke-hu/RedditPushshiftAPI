Longtime Lurker.1 Year Nicotine Free. Thanks for the inspiration.

I am a long time lurker. I made a resolution last year that after the Superbowl I would quit everything nicotine related. I read this sub for the first weeks every day gaining inspiration. If you are just starting, stick with it as it does get easier. If you posted throughout the last year thank you for the encouragement.

To do it right I had to quit drinking for the first two-three weeks and just realize if I had any nicotine I lost and the substance won. 

I feel so much better now and wish I had stuck with previous attempts, not to mention the money saved on not having to stop at store and buy a bunch of stuff I don't need. 

Good luck to everyone and Breath easy. On to the next resolution.

The Road to Recovery

Hey all, today I start my long journey to stop smoking, I'm still young and miss being able to breathe and sleep. 

I'm actually somewhat ashamed of what my health is like, considering I'm in my 20s and should be in peak performance. It's going to be a long, hard road, but so long as I have a support network it should be easier. 

Wish me luck!

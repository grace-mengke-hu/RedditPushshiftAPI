Hey guys! Just some friendly questions from a "noob" smoker

So i recently started smoking. It started out being a party thing, but i now smoke 1-2 cigarets a day. To be honest i like it. I am still at the point where i don't feel like i have to smoke, but i relax when i do it. I don't smoke when i'm with my friends, just when i'm alone/walking the dog. I live in Denmark and i'm 16 years old. Sooooo many i know smoke everyday, and they smoke alot more than me. I have some questions that i hoped you guys might be able to help me answer.


1. How much damage does an average person take by smoking 1-2 cigarets a day? I'm asking here cause when i search on the internet its always "HOLY SHIT SMOKING KILLS YOU AT AGE 20" or "Smoking is the best thing ever, keep going". I would like to get some knowledge from person who has "experience". 


2. Have any of you had smoking cause damage to your personal life? Friends who don't wanna be with you, girlfriends breaking up with you, etc.


3. Why did you decide to quit? So you could be more healthy, cause someone asked you to?



Thanks for the help on beforehand. I really am trying to decide wether to finish this pack of cigarets and never come back or if i could keep doing it the way i am.

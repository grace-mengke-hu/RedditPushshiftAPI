I'm in a foul mood. Not because of the RedBlackâ€™s loss. I won't smoke today.

I'm in a foul mood. No its not because the Ottawa RedBlacks lost the Grey Cup to Edmonton. Yesterday I felt great not smoking. Today I'm foul and not quite sure why. And yeah, thinking smoking will help. I know better but I'm thinking it.

I won't smoke. Here's why.

1. I have been having an excellent run, and with the help of this sub, I am winning. Tomorrow will be better.
2. I texted my (grown) kids last night that I had quit for week. My daughter was quite pleased.
3. My wife told me this morning she would quit smoking tomorrow. I knew she would once I quit. Here it is.

So, I won't smoke today. Power to all you freedom fighters out there.

Edit. I think I need some poutine for lunch. That will make me feel better.

Shortly after the New Years rush!

So it's officially been 24 hours, going without patches - cold turkey.
From 10-15 a day down to zip, cut out caffeine as well as it is a big trigger of mine.

Very worried about my next shift at work (haven't had one since I stopped smoking), as my line of work is a sound technician, long hours, stress, heaps of smokers. I just hope I can hold out for the first few shifts, I know it can only get easier from there.

Congratulations to everyone else who's on their journey either at day 1 or day 1000, GO YOU!

Almost thirty..

I grew up around smokers. Both my parents, all four of my grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins. By the time I started smoking around 16 or 17, I already felt addicted.. I would see someone smoking a feel like I needed one. So I started. And I always kinda said I'd stop by 30. Gave myself something of a free pass until then although I have attempted to quit about three times in the past couple years, the longest lasting almost six months.

Since I began smoking my dad dropped dead of a heart attack at 46, my grandfather died of lung cancer at 82, and my mother was recently diagnosed with a very poor prognosis type of cancer. My grandmother who quit at age 50 is now 82 and she's doing really well. She is gonna be a main source of inspiration for me. 

To the point: I got a cold last week and once again have a ridiculous cough that creeps on after. If I didn't smoke I'd be sick for a couple days and done with it, but no. I have to deal with this dreadful cough. I turn 30 in May. I have 8 left in my pack. I work tonight. I'm gonna finish my pack before bed and wake up tomorrow smoke free. I have tomorrow off so I can just hang around to deal with the worst of it if need be.

I just wanted to get this out. Any advice or support would be awesome. Happy Saturday :)

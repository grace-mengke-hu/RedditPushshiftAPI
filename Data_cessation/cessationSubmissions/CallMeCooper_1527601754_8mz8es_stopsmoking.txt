Got drunk last night. Hung out with smokers...

And didn't smoke! Sorry for the clickbaity title, lol. This really feels like a milestone. I've had nights where I've had a few drinks since quitting, but I always took it kind of slow just to be safe. 

Last night the drinks hit me a little harder than I was expecting. Nothing crazy, but I was definitely drunk. And hanging out outside with smokers, which sounds like a recipe for disaster. But I didn't even consider asking for a cigarette! It just didn't even come up. At the end of the night I thought to myself 'Hey! I didn't smoke. And why would I, I'm a non-smoker now!'

What has been your biggest quitting milestone so far? The first 24 hours, or the first week? A routine you were able to break, or a special event?

I have a Confession to make.

I smoke over month ago around 8 cigarettes on a night out,  haven't touched them since then again. But i was really sacred to start from day 1 again so i just ignored what happend. Now its over 30 days ago and i feel its was nothing. I'm still smoke free!

Should i go with it now or reset my timers ?
Setting up a second timer "last time smoked" to the "im done with that" tiemr feels like cheating on its own.

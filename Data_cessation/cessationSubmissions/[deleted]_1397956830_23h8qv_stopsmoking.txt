I'm having a problem with driving on warm breezy days. I'm afraid I'll cave when summer rolls around

Pretty much my favorite thing to do when I was smoke while driving. I have a new truck, blasting the music with the windows down and I actually feel myself reaching for a pack in my purse sometimes. It's weird because I wasn't really craving anything for the first month or two of quitting. It was like I never smoked. Now I'm getting EXTREME cravings when I even *think* about warm weather. It's like all I can think about while driving, while in class, walking to class, anything. 

I'm terrified that even if I make spring, I won't make summer. I just equate warm weather with a cigarette. Sorry if this was more like a rant, I just don't know what to do.

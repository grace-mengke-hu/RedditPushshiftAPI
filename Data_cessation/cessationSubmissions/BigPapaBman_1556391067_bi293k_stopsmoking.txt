Summer events holding me up

I'm ready to quit, but my addiction put up a new roadblock. I have two events that I attend in July and Sept. that are the main times I have the biggest issue with quitting over. Quitting and then smoking there seems like a good option until I try to stop now, then a just debate it with myself rather than quitting? Anyone have luck with making exceptions for things like this?

What do I do ! Help me

Hey reddit,

So time has come to make a decision been smoking pack per day for 15 years now but want to stop, I am having no issues with it so far yet but its just I want to go for healthy life from now. But here is a problem with my determination I can just give up I love smoking and I have my habbits deeply rooted like morning coffee and cigarete, etc etc. I recently started vaping with only 2mg of nicotine and its not bad but after week or so I have to put one normal cause I cant ressist. What do u recommend me? Just going all in or just changing to vape and then try to stop? I dont know

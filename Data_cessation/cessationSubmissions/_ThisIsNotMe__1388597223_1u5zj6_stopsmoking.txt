Any "smoking ritual" substitute?

Hi folks! I stopped smoking yesterday after 10 years of 1 pack/day smoking. My biggest problem is that I am really addicted and I really love some smoking rituals. Most specially after eating or when finally free after an hard day of work, when I seat down to take a coffee, tea or wine and do some reading or watch some movie. Do you use some substitute for this calm and relaxing (and seldom lonely and "self-intimate") moments? Thank you!

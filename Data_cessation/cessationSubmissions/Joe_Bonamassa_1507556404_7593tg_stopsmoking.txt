Ok, cold turkey attempt: failed miserably. Feel like an idiot.

Homer Simpson once said in a dialogue with Bart: „Son, you tried your best, and you failed miserably. The lesson here is: Don‘t try“. Matt Groening and his delicate sense of cynicism really help right now. 

I went from smoking nearly a pack a day to not smoking, app shows it‘s been 8 hours. Wow. A personal record not to be proud of. But I guess I was very optimistic on this one. 

After a great morning I had the worst time an hour ago, then bought a pack, smoked one, tasted terrible. The morning felt normal, but as more time passed, I really felt terrible. I‘ll have to tear up some kittens to feel manly again. 

So, next attempt: Going down the nicotine levels. Just ordered one of these vape things on Amazon, with the level of nicotine in my cigarettes. Plan on starting Wednesday, vaping one week before decreasing the amount of nicotine. After all, I could‘ve seen this coming, all the tests told me I had a very strong nicotine addiction. 

Boy, this was just pathetic. Ha.

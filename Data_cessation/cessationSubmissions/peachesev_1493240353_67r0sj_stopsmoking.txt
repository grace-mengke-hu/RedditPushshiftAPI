Stopped smoking 3 days ago. Been coughing ALOT . Just blew my nose and there was blood?!

Hi guys, 
So I gave up smoking about 3 days ago - smoking about 15 a day for 5 years. I've quit cold turkey, but have a couple of nicotine mints during the day if i feel a craving coming. 

Last night I barely slept because my coughing fits were so bad, it's like my smokers cough has got 10 times worse?! I know that you do cough a lot after quitting as your body is cleansing etc, but I just got a bit phlemy so I blew my nose and it was just blood. I didn't/have never had a nose bleed. 

Last Saturday I also coughed up a big ball of phlegm which had blood in it - this is what has made me quit. 

Is this normal? Has anyone else had anything like this happen? I am coughing a hell of a lot which is now beginning to hurt my throat. Not sure whether to pop to the doctors? I'm only 23! 

Thanks in advance :)

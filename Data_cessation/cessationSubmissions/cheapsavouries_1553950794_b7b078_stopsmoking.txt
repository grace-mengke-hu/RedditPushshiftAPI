Anyone else suffering vivid dreams about smoking?

I had my last cigarette on Monday morning, and have since been using my vape pen, which of course certainly isn’t better but it accommodates the oral fixation and nicotine fix. I’ve been having really vivid dreams about smoking, last night in my dream I gave into the temptation, rolled myself a cigarette and smoked it. I presume this is normal when quitting smoking, does anyone have any stories to tell from this? When are the ciggie dreams supposed to finish?

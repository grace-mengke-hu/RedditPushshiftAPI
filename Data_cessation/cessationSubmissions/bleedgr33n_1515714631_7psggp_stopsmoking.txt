A year ago today I had my last cig. Four days ago I ran my first marathon, and finished!

This is mostly me telling anyone out there that thinks it isn't possible that it is. If you think it is tough, well, it is. But it's not as tough as you think. Set a goal and don't let anything stop you. Mine was to quit smoking. My wife wanted to run a [Disney Marathon](https://imgur.com/a/SglQL). I said "let's combine the two." I wanted to see if I could do it in under a year. 

If you truly want to quit, use the most powerful tool you have, your willpower. It is possible. Good luck quitting!

Going Cold Turkey. Let's Do This!

I'm now 28. Started smoking at 15. Been smoking a-pack-a-day for the past 7 or 8 years. Stopped smoking for 3 months from March 2013 to June 2013, and I've been smoking heavily again for the past 2 months.

Anyway, I stubbed my last cancer stick 2 hours ago, and I'm determined to keep this crap away from my life for good. I've read The Book many times, in fact, it's placed at my bedside. I'll also be doing some major cut-downs on my alcohol and fast food intake, but that's a story for another day. 

Wish me luck!

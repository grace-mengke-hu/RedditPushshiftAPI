Well.. I made it though Christmas and so far, the snow shoveling.. on the home stretch to 1 year!

I sort of lurk here a lot and read more than I comment, but I'm kind of amazed with myself and thought I'd make a post. 

I'm at 307 days now smoke free.. I powered through the initial stages, and I've not had much in the way of cravings, which I was really worried about given the stresses of the holiday season.. Snow and Shoveling especially were triggers for me to smoke previously.. I absolutely HATE snow, so I don't just shovel, I rage shovel, and that made me want to smoke a lot in the past.. not so much this year. 

The closest I've come to smoking was a couple of days before Christmas when I sort of got the shaft on a work schedule. It ruined my Christmas plans and shortened my time off. but I worked through it and decided that smoking wasn't going to fix it so what would be the point.

on another note. Has anyone noticed that no matter how many people were after you to quit smoking, and how they kept it up all the time.. After a month or so they stop caring that you quit and there's no mention of it at all hardly. 

Anyway guys, Keep it up and keep the lungs pink!

Day 1!

I quitted drinking 2 months, pot 1 month ago, and since I can't believe how much better I'm feeling, I think it's finally time I lose the cigarrettes for good. 

For some reason, it's the one that scares me the most; I've been addicted to tobacco for 30 years, excepting 2&1/2 years during pregnancy and breast-feeding.

I have requested my badge (after plenty of lurking), started reading the Allen Carr book and I think I'll download an app as well, it did help a lot with alcohol.

I would appreciate any additional suggestions/reading material, I'm really looking forward breaking this last chain, but as the negative consequences are less apparent than with other substances, I know inside I'm going to have a really hard time denying myself "just one drag".

Thank you for reading.

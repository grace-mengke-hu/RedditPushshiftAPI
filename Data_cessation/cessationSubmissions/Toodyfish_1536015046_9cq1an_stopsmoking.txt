7 months smoke free! I win

It's been 7 months since I've smoked tobacco. I still smoke weed all the time, but I'm not trying to quit that just yet.  I don't even want to smoke anymore when I'm drunk and hanging out with people who smoke. And I feel 5,000 times better.  I can run again, for the first time in like 17 years. It's worth the two months of wanting a cigarette.  And occasionally I dream I'm smoking, but I don't really wake up wanting one.  I want one once in a while cause the first-lit smell is great but not really.  I wouldn't do it at this point.  Life is better not smoking.  I have a lot more money and I don't smell like a shitty old ashtray(yes you do, you just don't realize it. I do because I have a sense of smell again). I smoked two packs a day for 18 years, and if I can quit so can anyone. So yeah

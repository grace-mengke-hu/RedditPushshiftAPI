Year one in the books.

I smoked for 16 years, and today makes one year since I quit. It's been rough, but it's been totally worth it. I hope all of you that are just starting out or are farther along than me are kicking ass. Just wanted to share, and if you're feeling weak, don't. Just take a deep breath, you can do it!

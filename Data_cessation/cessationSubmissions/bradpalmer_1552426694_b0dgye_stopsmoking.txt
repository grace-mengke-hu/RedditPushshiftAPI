I need help!

I quit smoking in september 2016, it was not easy as its something i really enjoyed,but most of my friends were quitting or had quit and i even morivated some people around me to quit too. A few months later my wife followed suit as we planned on having a child, moving foward 2.5 years we have had our first child and wife has gone back to smoking, so have almost all of my friends that quit aroumd the same time as me. Crazy how addictive this shit is huh? Well now that basically everyone around me is smoking again im getting very heavy urges to pick the shitty habbit back up! Please guys I need your words of wisdom and support to nit do this again!

Here we go.

I've told myself "this is my last cigarette" too many times, but I'd like to mean it this time. As I type this, I'm getting ready to ash the last cigarette in the last pack that I have on me. I don't plan on buying anymore, but I'm sure you all know how well that plan tends to unfurl. Wish me luck.

One Week

Whenever I sense the craving, I take a deep breath, relax my shoulder, and close my eyes, let the craving come to me, try to find out what my physical reactions are. Most of the time I feel blood rush to my face, up to my forehead. 

I know at this time my body doesn't need nicotine anymore, but my brain may be in need of something. So I "imagine" I am smoking, as I inhale I feel the imaginary smoke go through my mouth and throat and to my lung, and see the damage it's doing along the way. Suddenly I realize how clean fresh air taste. I am glad I didn't actually smoke.  I focus on the inhaling and exhaling several times before the urge goes away. 

That's how I get through my cravings. I don't know if anyone do the same. It has been hard, and yet it's bearable. Plus it's sooo rewarding. I can taste clean air. I feel energetic again. 

One week mark. Thank you all for the support.

Almost a month and had a bad night

I smoked around a pack and a half for 5 years and I quit cold turkey, No gum, vaping, or patches. To my surprise I didn't get sick or get any headaches or feel like I wanted to die, I did want to smoke like more than anything but I have good will power so I haven't even touched one since. So I've been pretty normal. But last night I was a work (a family owned pizza shop) and we were dead like most Sunday nights and I started craving a cigarette like I do sometimes. This craving however was very stong, it was all I could think about and it gave me a migrane so bad I wanted to just lay on the floor and pass out. I kept strong and didn't smoke though and my boss keeps medication in the shop so I took some and my migrane subsided by the end of my shift. During this craving though I hated the only guy I worked with that night I was irritated and everything that was said to me by customers or anyone pissed me off. I was doing so good and it just felt like a moth of all this detoxing just blew up in one 6 hr shift. This happen to anyone else?

97 days, but christmas is the worst time

Back with my mom and sister for the holiday. Things are good but my mom is just so uterly annoying all the time for the stupidest things. It makes me want to smoke so bad. 97 day smoke free, haven't had a day this bad so far. Anyway, i know i can do this, just need to vent.

  


Have a great holiday, and keeps strong

Post smoking weight-gain. Help

Posted this in /r/fitness. If any of you have suggestions I'd appreciate it. 

I don't know if this is the place to post so redirect me if necessary. I am a 55 y.o. female, 5'8, previously a 30 yr smoker but quit about 4 months ago. I'm worried about my weight gain. Weight gain derailed my quit 25 yrs ago. I can't afford to go that route again. I'd like to say I don't know what happened, but eating happened. Here's the deal: I have a back condition which I manage by keeping weight low. I am beginning to feel weight gain's effect. I am a woman (vain one). I love being in great shape & I am not loving what is happening. 2 yrs ago I hired a trainer to help me stay in shape while I quit smoking. Never got to the smoking part but he did an awesome job. I'm busier now so regular visits to the gym not possible. I do have a full gym at my office. I've started working out but diet sucks. I try to eat at least 2 meals a day but only 30% successful at that. Often it's just dinner. I've started drinking Muscle-egg for breakfast & powdered protein drinks (Allmax iso natural) throughout the day. Was doing P90X but couldn't maintain my energy. Now doing cardio, some isometrics, but still not feeling good about it. When I get home at night I am starving. Any suggestions? Fear has me on a mission & I'm afraid

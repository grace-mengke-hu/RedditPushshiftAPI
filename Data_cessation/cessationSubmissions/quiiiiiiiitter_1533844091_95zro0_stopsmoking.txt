A Moment of Weakness

My mother in law is visiting. We went for a walk the other night. She had some Marlboro Gold 100s. She smoked one, I thought about asking for one but didn’t. Ten minutes later, she smoked another. 

I took a puff. 

It tasted familiar but unsatisfying. I gave it back. I didn’t want one. I thought I did, but nope. This wad dangerous and reckless of me, that’s why I’m saying something. I don’t want to smoke, not a puff, not at all.

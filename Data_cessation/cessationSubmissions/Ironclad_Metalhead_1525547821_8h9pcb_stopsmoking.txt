Intro and Hello to all at "Stopsmoking"

Hi Everybody,

Just wanted to introduce myself. Brand new to reddit, but not the internet. I heard about this group or at least ones like it before offline and wanted to join it as one of my subscriptions. I quit smoking about 5 years ago, and was finally successful with vaping and nicotine reduction.

Just wanted to join in case I could offer any advice to people as a former smoker for around 13 years.

Thanks!

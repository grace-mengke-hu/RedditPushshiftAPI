Using Steam to quit...

So, this may sound silly, but it's working for me, and I thought I'd stick it up as an idea for y'all. Simple rewards system - I was a pack a day for 10 years. So, every day I don't smoke, I let myself spend $5 on steam for a new game. Then, when I'm nic-fitting in the evening, I boot up the new game, and let myself be distracted until I fall asleep while getting a healthy dopamine rush from the game. 

5 weeks clean now, and I have more video games than I've ever owned in my life. Really stoked the Steam sale came out just as the quitting was getting rough... :)

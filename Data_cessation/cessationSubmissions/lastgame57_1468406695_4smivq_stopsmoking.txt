Coming up on two weeks, coughing alot

Friday will mark two weeks for my quitting, and I am dealing with frequent and productive fits of coughing. I have lozenges to help (Cepacol), but it is beginning to interrupt my day. 

Has anyone seen these while quitting, and is there anything you have used to help?

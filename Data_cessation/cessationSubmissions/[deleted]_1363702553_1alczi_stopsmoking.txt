Need some encouragement & help getting from 1-a-day smoking (sorry for pandering)

Hey all,

I'm on Day 1 of my 100th time quitting.  I've quit successfully for up to a year, but have failed miserably in my last several attempts.

The problem I've been having of late is that I'll be on a quit attempt, then end up smoking just one cigarette a day.  I lie to myself and say that it's just one, it's cutting back, and therefore it's better than being a full smoker.  But I know these are just excuses that keep me from actually quitting.  

Any advice on how to get past this 1-a-day thing would be appreciated.  

PS:  I've read Allen Carr's book and know what he has to say about it.  Also, sorry for fishing/pandering element of this post.  I don't have a great support system because I've failed quitting so many times that people don't believe me anymore when I say I'm going to finally do it.

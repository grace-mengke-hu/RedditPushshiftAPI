An article that helped me look at things differently

Hey, I've been trying to quit smoking now for a while, and I'm sure you all know how this goes, it was unsuccessful a number of times. I came across this article that I wanted to share with you all, as it really helped me put things into perspective: [https://medscreen.blog/2018/04/24/why-so-many-people-dont-succeed-when-they-try-to-quit-smoking-how-to-change-your-habits/](https://medscreen.blog/2018/04/24/why-so-many-people-dont-succeed-when-they-try-to-quit-smoking-how-to-change-your-habits/)

They talk about an approach in this article that kinda opened my eyes to some new ways of looking at things, anyway I really enjoyed it so I wanted to share with you all. I hope you enjoy like I did :). 

Long story short, so far it's been 3 weeks that I have been able to meet my goals. That's not completely stopping, though I am attacking the 'behavioral approach' from a number of different methods, and it's definitely moving in the right direction!

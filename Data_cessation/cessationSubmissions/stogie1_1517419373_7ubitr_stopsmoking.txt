How to mentally get back in to quit mode

I quit cold turkey for a month and a half, messed up by "just having one"
In short I am fully smoking agian around 20 a day.
The reason I was able to quit before was not because I should but because I truly wanted to.
My question is how does one get back to that mentally?

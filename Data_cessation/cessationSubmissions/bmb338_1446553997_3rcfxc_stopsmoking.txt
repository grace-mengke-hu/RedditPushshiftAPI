Coffee drinkers: did you cut down on coffee?

Hi all,

I am quitting today. I posted my reasons/rants on another thread (https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/3rcdir/waking_up_at_530_this_morning_was_the_last_straw/) but now I have a very specific question that I hope you can help me with.

I am a moderate-heavy coffee drinker (usually about 5-6 cups a day, occasionally more like 10-12). Everything I have read says that caffeine AGGRAVATES withdrawal symptoms, irritability, etc. But I don't know if I can quit two things at once. I have never really considered dramatically lowering my coffee intake as I'm pretty addicted to that as well.

Are there any (either former/current) coffee drinkers here who have experience with this? Before you askâ€“ no, I don't strongly associate coffee with having a cigarette at the same time since I usually smoke outdoors and drink coffee indoors.

Thanks!

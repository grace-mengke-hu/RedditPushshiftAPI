Vivid dreams about smoking

Does anybody else have dreams about smoking after quitting? I'd like to hear your stories! 

A couple of times I dreamt that I smoked a whole cigarette and it felt incredibly real and detailed, and then it was a great relief to wake up and realize that it was just a dream! 
Also tonight I had a very vivid dream where all my friends were smoking around me but at the end I turned a cigarette down and refused to smoke.

So, even though quitting is disrupting my sleep, there are improvements even there lol. I think it's a clear sign of the adjustments that are happening in my brain.

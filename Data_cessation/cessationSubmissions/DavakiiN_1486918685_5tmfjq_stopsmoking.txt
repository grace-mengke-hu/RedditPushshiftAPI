Thinking to stop smoking

well , i've been smoking for 2 years or more now , i have 19 years turning 20 this november ; before starting it i was used to do exercicing , then joined up a club of kung fu then after i had no real way to pay the monthly subscribtion i just stopped everything and started smoking ...
but the thing is im not addicted to cigarette , its just the habit of doing nothing i would smoke one for exemple after you eat at a fast food , hella good cigarette with that but anyway , 2 days now without it and i didn't feel a real need to smoke , perhaps it stays this way and even better i'll start looking for a workout club

How soon did YOU feel the effects after quitting?

I am brand new to this sub, and I am brand new to quitting as well (at least in a more serious, permanent way). I quit not even 2 days ago, and have already felt a few slight improvements health-wise. I feel that I am out of breath less often. Also, I began to notice smells that to which I was nose-blind before. It's mostly not-so-pleasant ones on my walk to work, but I'm happy to make use of a stunted sense again after almost a decade of smoking.

So after reading countless articles and studies on the effects of quitting, how was YOUR experience in this? Was it a shocking, "coming back online" experience, or just a gradual, grumpy road of avoiding cravings? I apologize it this is a common repost, but I am genuinely curious.

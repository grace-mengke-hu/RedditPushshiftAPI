Two days

I went out Friday night and had a good time. It was all the way across town, I've been walking a lot lately so I did a two am walk through the city. While walking and chatting with my friend I opened a new pack.

I got a few puffs in to the cigarette before something in my brain triggered. That it was poison. There were then multiple points of what seemed like all different parts of my brain agreeing. Followed by one clear thought which was get rid of it.

So I stomped it out, threw it away, and I haven't smoked since. I was OK through Saturday, just went to bed really early.

Now I'm getting ready to go for a walk and I'm putting it off. What in the world is there to do with your hands when you are walking?

I feel like I need to buy food just to get to my destination. I'm not worried about my weight it's just a surprising first suggestion I could come up with.

Mainly I'm planning a hiking trip to North in a month or so. I don't want to be smoking during that. But for the time being, what's the point? Why don't I just quit then?

Money doesn't matter to me, nobody cares anyway. What's the reason for quitting smoking?

If you quit smoking using a Nicotine Patch or Nicotine Chewing Gum, please take one of these surveys!

** If you quit using Chantix (or an alternative version of it) please take it too **

Hi all, some of you might remember that I posted a survey for you to take so I could see what the best way to quit smoking. It's for a project in a big science fair in Ireland. 
Well, the fair is this day next week and I still need some more responses for people who used nicotine patches or chewing gum to quit. 

Sorry if I'm getting annoying on this subreddit, I just really need some more responses. As you can guess, I'm very stressed right now haha.

So, the link is below. If you quit cigarettes with one of these methods, please take it, it would be a huge help.
(If you already took my last survey, please don't take this one because I'll just get duplicate results)

[The survey is here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1PFdByzHxXlnofE01vTJntncqe2bCJGQ12JHZz1fVcKI/viewform)

Thank you to everyone who participated!

Well my friends, today is the day.

I have just smoked my last cigarette. In fact, I couldn't even finish it because i just found it disgusting. After smoking over a pack a day for the last year, I've finally decided I've had it with the coughing and the smell to decide to quit. Now I know it won't be easy, but I'm willing to commit. Anybody have any advice to get through the first few tough weeks?

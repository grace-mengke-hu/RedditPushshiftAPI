finally can do a 25m exercise without rest!

I'm 25y, smoked cigs for 9 years , I Quit cigs 5 days 16 hours ago , and since the day 1 i started exercising , and for the first time in decades I can do 25m exercise daily , I Downloaded this program Focus t25 , it's good for starters , and It's working ! YAAY , I'm so happy , I Felt like my health is fucked up for good, I Couldn't do 10m cardio before without breaking down and wanting to through up, Now I do this 25m like a champ, and I only quit 5 days ago, but for the record i used to smoke 8 cigs or less a day , cuz i was a weed addict and i used to smoke spliffs , i quit weed 1 month 1 week ago , but hey if i can do it you can do it , and belive me your body is gonna recover so quilckly and your gonna feel so healthy and feel alive again . I really lost hope on my health in the past , A month ago after quiting marjuana i tried to workout and i failed as usual feeling much stress and tiredness, but hey you should quit all the shit you do to your health first , and one by one your body is gonna recover and everyday your performance is gonna get better. keep it up family

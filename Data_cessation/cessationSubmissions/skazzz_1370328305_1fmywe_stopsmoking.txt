One week down!

I'm a week in and going strong. Thank you guys so much! I don't think I would've made it without this subreddit to check in with.

Just wanna say to those lurkers here who are considering it: go for it. You've got nothing to lose and honestly it's been way easier for me (cold turkey after 15 years) than I thought was possible. It hasn't been a picnic by any means, but it's not as bad as I thought it was going to be at all.

I'm not totally out of the woods yet cravings-wise, but I'm confident I can do it. I can't wait to be celebrating a year.

Thanks again guys!

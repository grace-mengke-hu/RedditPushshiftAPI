24+ hours

I have been wanting to quit smoking king for way to long now. I've been following this thread started listening to the Allen Carr book.  Watching YouTube info.  Still couldn't quite work up to actually quitting. So I came down with a case of Bell's palsy that caused me so much pain that the thought of the effort that it would take me to get downstairs and smoke a cigarette was not worth it.  So in 24 hours I have not smoked.  This morning the pain is a bit better and I took a walk to the local pharmacy for medication.  I had a couple of cravings but tried to remind myself it's not worth it.  I guess I'll keep reading and watching and maybe hopefully these cravings get easier and I can quit. Hoping I can do it

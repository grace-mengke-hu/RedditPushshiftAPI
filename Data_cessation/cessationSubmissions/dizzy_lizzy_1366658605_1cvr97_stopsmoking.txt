As of today, one full year without cigarettes!

My badge is slightly different, but I mark April 22nd as my quit day.

It's been a good year. I don't have any urges at all anymore, except when I smell black cloves... cloves were my first brand, and when people come through the drive-through where I work and blow clove-smoke in at me, I get this huge rush of nostalgia for that period in my life, and I suddenly want to taste the sweet flavor thing they put on the filtertips.

But it's not that hard to fight against that urge. I have so much going for me it's ridiculous; I've never been happier or healthier, and I know that my partner would probably leave me if I started smoking again. Plus, given the medication I'm on, it'd probably kill me! ;D (blood clots)

Random post with  no real point, just... I feel really good!

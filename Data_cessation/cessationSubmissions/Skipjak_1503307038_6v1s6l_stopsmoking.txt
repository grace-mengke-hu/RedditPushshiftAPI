Here's to two weeks!

Today marks two weeks completely nicotine free for me, after smoking a pack a day for 7 years!

I get about one craving a day now, but it's usually very manageable. I've gotten drunk at parties and bars without really wanting to smoke, nevery thought I'd be able to pull that off.
What really did it for me this time (this is my second quit) is 'Freedom from nicotine' by John R. Polito, available as paperback or as a free PDF. People keep recommending Allan Carr's Easy Way, but I found 'Freedom from nicotine' a much better read. Can't recommend it enough.

The trick really it to vow to never allow any nicotine into your body again. It's a simple rule to follow, once you're past the physical cravings that it. Follow the rule and you will not relapse.
During my previous quit I smoked the occasional drunk cigarette or mixed weed-tobacco joint, which led me to relapse. Don't make this mistake. Don't vape nic juice, don't smoke cigars, don't smoke spliffs - considering yourself a recovering heroin addict: he wouldn't touch heroin ever again either.

What I love the most about quitting is how this 'veil' is lifted from your psyche. For a couple of years, I was in a permanent semi-depressed state, but I couldn't really figure out why. 
Quitting smoking has revealed that it was the smoking causing all of it. I feel so much better mentally as well as physically. 

I love the little, unexpected benefits as well. I just had a piece of chocolate for the first time in a while, and I was moved by how nice it tasted. Going out cycling in nature and actually smelling nature. 

Good luck to every one of you. Quitting is so worth it! Keep it up.

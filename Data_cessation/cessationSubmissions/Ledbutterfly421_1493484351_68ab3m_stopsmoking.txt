7 days

One week in on my restart. It's interesting to me how many people have offered me cigarettes after I told them I've stop smoking. Even more interesting is that during those times I'm the strongest about not smoking. It's my quiet peaceful times alone (which is most of the time) I get heavy cravings. I just keep reminding myself they will  pass 🙏🏼 I really need to get outta of my head the disappointment I feel because this should actually be 3weeks nicotine free instead of 1. I slipped up on my bday 😞 sorry for rambling. Have a wonderful Saturday 💜

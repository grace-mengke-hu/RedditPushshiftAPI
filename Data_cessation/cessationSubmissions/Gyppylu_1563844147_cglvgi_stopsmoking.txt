Falling off the wagon...need support!!

I quit smoking cold turkey on January 17 of this year, having smoked full time for 5 years. For the first couple months, I thought about cigarettes nearly every day, most of all day, but had no desire to actually smoke. I quickly began to feel SO much better, and loved how I could breathe again! I just overall felt so much more vital and healthy, and strangely enough my mental health improved greatly as well (though there were other lifestyle changes that were contributory as well).

I made myself a deal from the beginning that if I was drinking at a party or get together I could still smoke. I don't drink very much in cold weather (It's just not something I crave) so I did just fine having a few cigarettes with drinks a couple times a month and having no desire to smoke otherwise.

Fast forward to...a month ago. Weather getting warmer, more parties and social gatherings happening as summer ramps up. I started smoking every weekend...then eventually a day or two through the week if I had a beer after work (as soon as I crack the beer I light a smoke)...and the last couple weeks I've been smoking almost every night after work, whether I drink or not.

I'm aware I'm slipping. I hate smoking. I feel like shit when I do, I immediately can't breathe, my heart starts pounding. I feel ill, it tastes gross, it stinks and leaves a bad aftertaste in my mouth. Mentally i feel disgusted, sad and disappointed in myself. But if there is a pack on hand, there's some uncontrollable titanic part of my subconscious that urges, "SMOKE! YOU'LL HATE YOURSELF BUT IT'S WORTH IT."

I need words of encouragement and advice please! I know it's normal for smokers to relapse a few times in the quitting process, but I just thought I was stronger than this. I'm thinking I may have shot myself in the foot with my allowance of cigarettes when drinking...i didn't account for summertime shenanigans.

Soon to be a doctor and finally quit.

So I'll be a doctor in about 8 months and I've smoked 2-3 cigarettes a day for the last 4 years. I finally threw away a full pack of cigarettes today because I think I've had it. The guilt of it all was way too much largely because I knew exactly what I was doing to my body and the hypocrisy of it was getting to me. I have exams in a week and I guess that was making me smoke more even if I wasn't studying as much (vicious cycle). So I was finally done with it all and decided to just stop. If I get cravings I'll chew gum or meditate, but I am so through and done. I cannot keep carrying this guilty habit of mine. Do you guys have similar stories ?

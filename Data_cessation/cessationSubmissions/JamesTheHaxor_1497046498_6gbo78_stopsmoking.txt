The new day is nearly hear and the battle has started. Roll on day 1, I'm ready for you!

I'm posting this more of a personal reflection so I can look back.

I just smoked my last cigarette. I decided today enough was enough and made it a plan to stop smoking at 12:00am. It signifies the start of a new day, and a marker I can use to count the number of days I quit. I chose 12:00am because mentally it helps me.

I've been heavily into exercise recently and noticed I am not performing as well. I've tried to increase my fitness while smoking, but it doesn't work. I usually jump rope 2000 times every other day, plus some weight lifting. I managed 500 times today before I had to stop.

That was it for me. I knew I was letting myself get into bad shape. At 32 it's time to quit this crap. I've had Cancer 4 years ago, my Dad died of Cancer in January. That should have been enough to quit ... but it wasn't.

Farewell cigarettes. It's been fun, but you've probably already done enough irreversible damage to my body.

I hope I can look back on this post in weeks to come with success.

This is a message to my future self when I'm feeling stressed and agitated ... Remember when you write this post and you fed up of smoking? Remember how it made you tiered a lot, and added an extra 15 beats to your resting bpm (because it's always done that whenever I start up again!)? Remember the bad smell, and the orange stains on your fingers you have to scrub in the bath every day? Just remember how disgusting you felt when you write this and remind yourself never to start up again!

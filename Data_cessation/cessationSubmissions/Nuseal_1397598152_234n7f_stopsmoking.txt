Day 1

I'm finally ready for the commitment to start my journey on not having a cigarette. I think posting here will be great motivation to not have a cigarette. I want to do this for my health and my girlfriend. No more excuses, it is time to get this over with! Wish me luck guys, I will be checking this sub-reddit very regularly for support. 

Here we go!

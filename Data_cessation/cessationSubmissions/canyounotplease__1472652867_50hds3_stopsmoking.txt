Been sleeping REALLY hard?

Hey everyone!
Day 3 and going really strong. I've been using patches and plan on doing so for maybe two more weeks.
The only side effect I've really noticed is that I CAN NOT wake up to my alarms in the morning. I love been taking it off about an hour before bed each night to prevent night terrors. 

I feel super rested but I've been going to bed a couple hours earlier because I'm just so exhausted at night. Anyone else experience this? Did anything help? I am trying to at least keep a good diet and I'm exercising regularly! Good luck to everyone keep going strong!!

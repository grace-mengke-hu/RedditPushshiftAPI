Just Quit Today

Been smoking for 12 years - pack a day. Been smoke free for 5 hours now and have had withdrawal symptoms.  Today is the day I have decided to quit. Today is the day I take back control of my life. 

Going cold turkey. I am determined to quit this habit in the butt and be a non smoker ! Happy to join the group.

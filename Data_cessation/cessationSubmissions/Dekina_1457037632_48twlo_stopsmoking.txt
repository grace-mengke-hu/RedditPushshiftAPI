I am a giant mess!

I know that depression and anxiety happens often, when you are quitting smoking. I have been struggling with severe depression for several years, with a sprinkle of anxiety and panic attacks. But it has been years, since I have been as big of a mess, as I am now.


Reasons for a 29 year old woman to burst into tears, version Today Only:

I forgot which way my door swings, pushing when I should have pulled, and for a split second thinking I was stuck in my room for all eternity.

I got a nice text from my long-distance boyfriend, swamped in work. That was so nice.

Said boyfriend did not answer to my reply, therefor he must either be dead, or no longer love me.

I dropped a cup of coffee.

My cup did NOT break. (I love that cup, almost more than my son)

I managed to poke myself in the eye with my hairbrush.

I dropped a bag of chips. Closed, but I dropped it, and that was awful, apparently.

I was occupied, got a severe craving, took a breath mint instead. Force of habit, I attempt to inhale breath mint, I choke, I cry for 10 minutes.

A lady on the bus smelled of smoke, sat next to me, and I remembered that I used to smell like that.

A friend from Texas texted me good morning, while I was preparing dinner. Him being so far away was apparently also reason for a 10 minute cry. We've never met. Distance has never ever been an issue.

I was so scatterbrain, that I put on the wrong color nail polish.


I certainly hope one or two of you had a little laugh. I did. I love that these are the side effects of quitting. Not only is there a visible effect on my health, my skin, my teeth, but there is a very visible effect in my mood as well. I am cherishing every single, completely ridiculous, little "episode". This too, shall pass. I can't wait to look back on this! 28 days smoke free, and 6 nicotine free. I am really loving every step.

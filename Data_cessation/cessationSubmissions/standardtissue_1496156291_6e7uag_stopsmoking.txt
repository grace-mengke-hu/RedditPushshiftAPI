To patch or not to patch

I'm using some apps for the first time to help quitting.  I've been using an app to lose weight and it's helped tremendously with the gamification, tips etc. 

I never thought of nicotine itself as a big part of the problem.  Now the apps are teaching me that it leaves your body in about 48 hours and it's a problem by itself even if you don't smoke.  

I've been patching and I've done ok for a day with the patch but I still have little pangs of craving.  I'd like to remove the patch and start my 48 hours now to get it over with but I'm worried that it's going to be really tough, that I won't be able to function well at work, will be way too edgy with the family, etc so I'm worried about that.  But the app keeps marking progress for me as if I don't have any nicotine at all.  I definitely want the help of the apps and monitoring my progress in them is helping.  Should I just bite the bullet and remove the patch ?

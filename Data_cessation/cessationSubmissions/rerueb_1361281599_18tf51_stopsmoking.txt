3rd day and going insane


The last smoke I had was last Saturday. Been smoking for 10 years, the last 5 years 2 packs a week but before that barely 1 pack a week. I was one of those who always thought that quitting was easy; but I tried a couple of times and failed miserably- couldn't go beyond 7 days abstinence. So I took off a sick leave for this week to manage the pangs... work place is also a major trigger. Yesterday and Sunday went fine without any urges but today had been tough. Strangely enough I have shortness of breath but the hardest thing is that I'm not able to do anything. Everything seems boring. I don't want to be around people because I think that I will get even more irritated. I don't want to cook or even watch a movie. Tried sleeping and failed. Headache is being taken care of with Aspirin. Went for a ~7km run, felt good but the depression is back once I got home. All I can think of is JUST ONE PUFF to take me out of this misery but I know very well that I will feel even more miserable if I light up. Confused. Unable to focus on anything. Locked in at home and gulping bottles of ice water. I'll pass through today, but I'm so fucking worried about tomorrow and the days to come... that I'll get even more depressed and give in. For how long will I feel this shitty?

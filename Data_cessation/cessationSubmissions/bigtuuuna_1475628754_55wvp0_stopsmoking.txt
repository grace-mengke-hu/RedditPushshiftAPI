Well guys, day 3 is on its way out.

The amount of mental fuckery I've been going through is amazing. 

So last night, I was drinking and watching the vikings game. When I had an insane crave. My head felt like it was imploding. I went outside, and my roommate was smoking. I tried to get my mind to convince itself I didn't need one. But I asked for one. I took a drag and felt terrible. As soon as I took the drag, my body went numb and I had to sit down. I immediately put the cig out and went inside. I failed. 

Except, I really didn't. The old me after quitting would have gone through that smoke and kept going and said "fuck it" and then given up. This time, I threw it down, and kept moving forward. 

I put a patch on this morning and went to work and didn't even have a second thought. Are patches cheating? I tried with and without, and this seems to help me get rid of routines. 

Thanks for all the support guys. :) 

Tldr; I puffed a cig and put it out.

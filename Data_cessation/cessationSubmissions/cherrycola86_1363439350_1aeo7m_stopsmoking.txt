Is this normal?

Historically I quit smoking an average of twice a year and last between 2 days to 6 months. The last couple of times I've experienced mind numbing depression after about 24 hours, I struggle to speak and feel really detactched. It's quite frightening. I also have just been randomnly bursting into tears for no apparent reason. I am happy with my life and it is really putting me off continuing the most recent attempt at quitting (24 hours in!).
Has anybody else experienced this sadness , and when will did it pass?
Thank you so much

5 Years Clean!

Hard to believe it has been 5 years since I last smoked a cigarette.  [I even wrote about my initial trauma of quitting on reddit shortly after I put the smokes down for good.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/9g222/askreddit_its_been_58_hours_since_i_quit/) I was a pack a day guy for 20 years and I can say I have not cheated in that time - not even a puff. All I can say is that quitting has been easily one of the best decisions made in my life. My health is improved and I've saved probably around $10000 from not buying cigarettes. It's funny how the body can heal. I've actually taken up distance running as my hobby, something that was completely unthinkable 5 years ago. 

Well, best of luck to everyone out there who is using this subreddit for quitting support and advice. I hope you are successful.

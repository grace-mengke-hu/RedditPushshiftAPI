Pissed at myself.

So, I had a great (my best ever) run of 7 days smoke free until today. A little info -- I have been going to the gym for 10 days now in order to get my life back in shape and today I met this guy who was a newbie there and he asked whether i wanted to smoke or not and i said yes and smoked a cigarette. Now im feeling like shit again, as though I've lost all my progress. I am not going to repeat it ever. Gonna make it to 7 days again now. Just pissed at myself for letting go of my fuckin will power.

Quit for a month, then started again for the sake of my marriage

I was able to quit smoking for nearly a whole month starting at the beginning of March, and cheated intermittently throughout April before I ruined it again.

The thing is, from the day after I quit smoking until the day I started again, my libido was at a full stop. I literally was never turned on. Never. Not even sort of. The few times (maybe three?) that my husband and I did have sex was because I knew it needed to happen for the sake of our relationship (it's very important to him, Love Languages, etc).

Point is, I know there's a distinct chance at weight gain (definitely felt that one too), sleeplessness, headaches, irritability, and all the rest, but has anyone else experienced a drop in their libido concurrent with quitting smoking?

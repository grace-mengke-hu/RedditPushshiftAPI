21 days to break a habit

I know that theory has been debunked, but it's still a milestone, and one that I achieved today! 

It still crosses my mind from time to time, but less every day. I'm noticing more that when I think about it, it's "geez, I usually have a smoke when I drive. Well done!" or "wow, this coffee isn't even making me want one."

But... I have an unopened bottle of wine. I also have a new book and a new candle. It sounds so relaxing and cozy to read with a glass of wine and a nice scented candle, but I'm nervous about wanting a cigarette. I don't have any, and certainly would never drink and drive to go get some. What do you think I should do?

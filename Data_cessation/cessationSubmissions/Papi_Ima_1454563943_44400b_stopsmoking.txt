Hour 1. Also, my face and hands are turning gray

I just stopped.

I'm turning gray.  Literally, my face has a gray pallor and so do my hands.  I started noticing it a few days ago in a pronounced way, and my doctor says my heart is beating too fast and I have to come by the office to pick up a heart monitor to wear for a day.  Started smoking when I was 15.  Now I'm 41.  

I'm done.

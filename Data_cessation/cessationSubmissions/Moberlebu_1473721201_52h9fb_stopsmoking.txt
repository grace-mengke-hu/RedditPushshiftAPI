Anti craving tracks.

Whenever I get a craving I play a favourite track as loud as possible and I dance and/or sing along. It is the perfect substitute because it releases a lot serotonine or dopamine in the brain (as does nicotine) and it takes around 3 minutes = the craving will have passed. 

The last couple of days I've been 'using' Hot Knife by Fiona Apple and Trailblazer by Oh Land. (Trailblazer almost feels better than nicotine!) 

Try it if you haven't already. And if you have I'm curious for the tracks that does the trick for you??

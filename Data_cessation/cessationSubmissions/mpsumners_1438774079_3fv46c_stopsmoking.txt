This is a strange time

So I am 135 days smoke free. Super fantastic news however I am in a strange place. I wonder if any of you get these feelings. I know I am free, addiction free half the time I don't even think about it or anything. However that little monster has been niggling at me more and more recently and I don't know why. I've gone back to fighting the urges, the cravings and thinking to myself I might just have one again, why not. I know that one leads to many and I have to fight the urges but after 135 days I thought I'd cracked it but here I am back to what feels like day 13.5. Four months down and I just don't understand why I'm craving them now again like really bad! Anyone else share the same experience?

About an hr away from 3 days smoke free! Having some strong cravings so posting here...

I'm about an hr away from 72 hours smoke free after smoking a pack a day for 10 yrs. Got bad enough Craving where I even had to go outside and pretend to smoke a fake cigarette in hand for about an hr. Was listening to music and also have a beer in hand but still smoke free!  Craving is worse than yesterday and just wanna shake it off. Posting here for support. 

Edit: breathing exercise is helping out. Breathe deep through nose, hold, then release through mouth.

2 month in and facing my hardest cravings

I’ve quit for two months, and aside from the first few days it’s been a pretty alright ride. Today is the first day since the initial quit that I feel like I’m really struggling. Could be the fact that I’m quite sleep deprived as work hours have been pretty unforgiving in the last few days. But I know how much worse it will make me feel. That’s what I’m trying to focus on. Smoking is a villain with no upsides. I’ll beat it

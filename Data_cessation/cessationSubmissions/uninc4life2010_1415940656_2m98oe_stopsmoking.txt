Getting close to 3 months smoke free, but I keep having dreams that I started smoking again. Does anyone else have these dreams?

I swear I have had this dream close to 10 times now!  I am hanging out with a group of people, usually doing something exciting, and before I can do anything, I have a cigarette in my hand, and I'm smoking away like there's no tomorrow.  A feeling of regret and defeat quickly comes over me as I realize that nearly three months of determination have been ruined by a lapse in judgement.  Then I wake up and realize it's all been a dream, but it's starting to get a little annoying now that I keep dreaming about relapsing.  Anyone else ever had a dreams like these?

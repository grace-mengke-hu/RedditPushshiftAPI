Overcame craving but temptation almost got me

I am on my 6th day without smoking. I was a smoker for roughly 30 years and have attempted two other times in this time period to stop, unsuccessfully.

I've managed to make it these 6 days with help from a nicotine patch, an app on my phone, and support via sm platforms.

Tonight was bad. I got up from trying to sleep as I could not. Whenever this occurred when I smoked, I would immediately go outside and smoke and then go back in and go to sleep. Tonight I got up and wanted that damn cigarette. I was mad at myself for having quit because I needed that to calm my nerves and to get some rest (so I trick myself into believing). The urge to smoke was stronger than any other craving in these 6 days. I don't know how I passed the craving. For the first time I honestly thought about whether this was all worth it and whether I should say screw it and start again. I prevailed. Albeit the temptation to give up was brief its concerning I even had the thought. Any tips to try and prevent myself from trying to rationalize smoking again? Obviously twice before I tricked myself to start again but I'm hoping this time it's different and permanent.

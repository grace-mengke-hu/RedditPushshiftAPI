Day 18 - Cravings While Driving

Today was kind of rough.  I had cravings on the ride in to work, and cravings again after lunch, and on the ride home from work.  The common thread was my car, and driving.  It seems like every time I drive I feel the urge to light up.

Up to this point I have relished the cravings, and felt rather exultant when they came, but today was a challenge.  I have identified the trigger, so how is this supposed to work? 

Do I consciously think about smoking in the car to deprogram that craving?  What is the next step after identifying a trigger, aside from not following it obviously.

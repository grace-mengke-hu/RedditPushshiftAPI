I just had my last cigarette

Today, I'm walking away from this addiction that has been holding me hostage. I'm walking away from years of abuse to my own body. I'm saying goodbye to the smell, the stigma, the wasted money, and the cough. I want to free myself from the feeling that I enjoy something so toxic.

I want to see my daughter graduate and walk down the aisle someday. I want to hold my grandchildren. I want to meet the love of my life and not have him watch me slowly wither away. I want to walk into a room and not immediately be known as the smoker. I want my daughter to see that a life lived well, is not one where I've been held captive by a tobacco company. I want my car, my clothes, and everything to be a safe place and not things tainted by second hand grime. And I want to live a life where I can breathe, smell, and taste freely.

Today is my quit day. I'm relieved and nervous. But so many of you have inspired me. I'm going cold turkey armed with chapter 6 of allen Carr's book and the support from all of you! 

I hope you all have a beautiful, smoke-free day!

A question about exercise

Since I started smoking over 13 years ago, I have put on about 60 lbs. I use to be active and athletic, but cigarettes just made running around impossible. I developed a wheeze whenever I would move past a fast walk and I would get a sharp tightness in my chest. Today marks my 2nd full week without a cigarette and I decided to try to take a jog. Well, unfortunately it did not go as I'd hoped. I couldn't get more than half a block before having to stop, the wheezing and tightness in my chest still there. How long should I wait before getting into an exercise regiment? Should I just try to power through the wheezing? Thank you all so much for the suppose over the past 2 weeks. I really don't think I could have made it this long smoke free without you!

Made it through some challenging situations

Day 4 smoke free.  I made it through work yesterday without smoking.  I also graduated from college last night.  After graduation, I went out to a bar with my husband.  I opted to sit inside because I knew that sitting out on the patio (especially with my husband who still smokes) would be challenging.  I had a couple beers and a spicy burger (drinking and spicy food are definite triggers for me.)  I chewed a lot of gum and kept my hands busy and resisted the temptation to smoke!  Feeling pretty good today!

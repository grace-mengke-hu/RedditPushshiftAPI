I am ready to stop, but need the nicotin..

I have been smoking for 10 years, stopped once for 1.5 years without too much issues.

However, I felt dumb and distracted. I think nicotin really 'enhances' my capacities, and I need to keep that in my newly found high demanding job..

Any ideas? Would e cigs with nicotin work?

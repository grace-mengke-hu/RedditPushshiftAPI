Help pls

I really really really need to wake up tomorrow, go to work at 9am, have a cup of coffee, lunch, then another coffee, work until 6pm and finally go back home without smoking a single cigarette. (I usually smoke around 5-6 cigs between 9am and 6pm) 

Any tips/tricks/help is much appreciated. Thanks &lt;3

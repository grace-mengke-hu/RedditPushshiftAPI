Ecig Advertising almost as low as big Tobacco.

Logged into the r/smoking subreddit to see a banner ad for an ecig company with an attractive woman holding an ecig and the following text "Are Ecigs really 99.9% healthier than cigarettes? NEW evidence suggests you can save your lungs!" 
These fuckers are almost stooping as low as big Tobacco in their advertising.

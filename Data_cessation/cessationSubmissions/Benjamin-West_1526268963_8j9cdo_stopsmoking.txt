Tomorrow is the day

I’m s half a pack a day smoker for like 10 years. 14-24

My last pack is half gone. I won’t finish it. I only buy cartons and as I was in the store going for my next carton. My daughter looked at me and smiled real big and instead went an isle over and bought some lozenges. 

I’m sick of it. And so ready to stop. My daughter is becoming so aware that she picks up crayons and acts like she is smoking. ( I only smoke outside and try to hide it from her, but it’s almost impossible as you know) she’s 3 and will start pre school soon. I’m done.

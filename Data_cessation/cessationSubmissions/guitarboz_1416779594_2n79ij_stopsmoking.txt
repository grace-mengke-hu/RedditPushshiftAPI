Stopping Today..

Alright I'm 'stopping' smoking today. I have one cigarette left and going to smoke it in about an hour. Im doing it cold turkey. Im a pack a day smoker for the last 2 years, half pack before then. My last quit was 3 summers ago and i made it 4 months. I moved to a new city and i started smoking socially to meet people at bars/school etc. Im in debt 35k from college moved to Alberta for the next few years to pay it off and i just can't afford to smoke if I want to reach this goal quick. Any tips or words of support would be greatly appreciated! Good luck to all others going for it as well!

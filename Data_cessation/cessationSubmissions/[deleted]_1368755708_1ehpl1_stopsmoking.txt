Anyone found themselves more out-of-shape AFTER quitting?

I've been off for almost seven months. I haven't gained any weight (although was already/still am slightly overweight), and I'm definitely breathing better when resting/sleeping, etc. But during anything that could count as cardio, even going up stairs and stuff, I've actually found myself losing breath even faster than when I smoked. Heart pounding more, chest feeling quite full. 

Anybody else found this? Am I just feeling the same as before, but now my lungs are clearer I can actually register it, or something?

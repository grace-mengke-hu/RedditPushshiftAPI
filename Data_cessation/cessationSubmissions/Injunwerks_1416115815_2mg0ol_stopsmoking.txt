1 year Today!!!

I just wanted to share with you guys... started smoking in '87... quit several times but it never took... i bought an e-cig last year and haven't had a smoke since.. haven't had the e-cig in about 9 months... just wanted to share, I'm tickled to have realized this. Reading all of the posts  from other Redditors definitely helped.

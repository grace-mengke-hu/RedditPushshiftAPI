It's been a few days. Lungs hurting.

Hey. It's been about 5, 6 days now.

Most symptoms are easing up, I'm still sleeping a little rough and my head still hurts every now and then.

But my lungs, man! They're feel tight, with a tearing sensation if I breathe in too deep. There's a persistent, dull ache to them.

I read that I can expect "cold-like" symptoms for some time, so I'm not freaking out too much right now. When do I need to start worrying?

One week down tomorrow!

Tomorrow will mark the end of the first week I've been a non smoker since I was 15. I'm turning 28 next month. The first few days were hard, but it's getting a bit easier. It's been a little hard for me to view this as an achievement though, I'm not entirely sure why, it might have something to do with trying to not bring it up much or at all in front of my husband, who is still smoking. Still, I think after a month I might treat myself to something nice.

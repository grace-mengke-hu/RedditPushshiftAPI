2 days in - terrible quitters flu advice

Hello all! I was a smoker for 15 years, about a pack a day. I started my quitting journey 2 days ago. Yesterday and Day 0 (Quit day) I was ok, cranky, a bit tense, but okay. Today I feel like I was hit by a car. I'm so tired, everything hurts. Chest pain and tightness - some dizziness. I feel nauseous and depressed (I.e. cry all the time). I know quitting is tough and my body is detoxifying and its hard on the body. I am wondering if anything helped if you had any similar symptoms. I am resting but have had some insomnia problems since Day 0. I eat healthy (Keto) and generally exercise - however I am in a boot and am on limited weight so cardio has been banned until I see the doc again. Hopefully this will pass in a day or two - or at least lessen in severity. Thanks in advance!

Dream smoking??

Ok, I'm at the 51 day mark going strong, at this point no withdraws,cravings. I can even comfortably be around my husband
smoking no problamo. 

BUT

I dream a lot. Almost every night and I still smoke in when dreaming. I will have lucid dreams about normal stuff [I dream a lot about normal days- could be memories? Donno] But I smoke in every dream, remember the taste, smell, everything. LIKE I NEVER STOPPED. And as so as I wake up I'm all HOLY SHIT I SMOKED WTF-....wait... 0.0

Unconscious cravings or something, I guess. Anyone else?

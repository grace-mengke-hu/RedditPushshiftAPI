Cigarettes don't do SHIT for you #REMINDER

Just a small reminder for everyone:

Cigarettes don't do shit for you!! 

You won't relax from them: they get your heart rate up = more stressed.

They are not enjoyable: just the fix of nicotine makes you feel more happy, after you just want the fix of nicotine more and more....

Non-smokers are happier and more relaxed than smokers

All smokers envy non-smokers, not the other way around!

The 'just one cigarette' doesn't exist, ever.

Don't fall into the trap, not one more puff no matter what!!

Will it ever stop?

Hey, I'm new here. I'm 27 year old male and I'm currently on my 83rd day of not-smoking (according to an app on my phone), and I have not smoked 1649 cigarretes I would normally smoke in that time. I smoked for about 9 or 10 years previously, most of that time a pack a day. This is the second time I'm quitting (first time I aided myself with citizine, this time it's cold turkey), I tried last year but relapsed after a month.



This time it was surprisingly easy to go through the whole withdrawal process, don't know why.  I did gain about 10kg in the process, and I've always been fat anyway, even though I now excercise almost everyday. I do notice the money savings, but I could afford smoking anyway, and also I still burn the money on stupid shit like games and electronic toys. However, I expected all the cravings to go away by the time I reach 3 months, and the physical ones pretty much did, but it's something else. I feel... sad because I miss my cigarettes. It's like missing an old friend I'm not seeing anymore. There's rarely a day I can go through without thinking about how I miss them. And I just feel that if I just started smoking this feeling of sadness would go away as I would once again have something to look forward to in a day. I keep going back to the thought that on my 100th day, I would buy a pack and smoke one - to see if I'll like it. I know, I know, it's a stupid idea...



Has anyone felt similarly? Does it go away?

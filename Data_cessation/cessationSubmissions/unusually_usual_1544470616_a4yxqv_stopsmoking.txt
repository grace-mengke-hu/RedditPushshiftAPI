Urge for an “official last cigarette”

This isn’t my first quit attempt, but it is the first time I’ve been determined to quit because I truly want to quit. 

I spent the last 2 weeks before today identifying and documenting all of my triggers. The last 4 days, I didn’t smoke more that 2 cigarettes each day as I clung to My smoke crutch and “practiced” distracting myself from my triggers and urges. 

I’ve been smoke free (app user here!) for just under 24 hours. 

That said, I cannot shake the urge to smoke an “official last cigarette”. My last cigarette just happened without any ceremony in my mind. I keep mulling it over and over in my head that I NEED a “closure smoke” and that my last smoke doesn’t count.  I’m in a circular argument with myself as to whether or not I should do it. Will I regret not doing it and look back at smoking with fond thoughts and set myself up for failure? Will smoking an official last cigarette be a huge trigger and ruin my will? I’m doing my best to stay on course, but damn addiction and anxiety suck. 

How the hell do I shake this thought? 

Did you have these thoughts?

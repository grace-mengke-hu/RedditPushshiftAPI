How do I quit juuling?

I've never posted to reddit before so I don't know how it works so bear with me. 

I've smoked cigarettes for a year (and juuled on top of that), then I quit cigarettes cold turkey when I had to stay in the hospital for two weeks (not related to smoking). Once I was released, I started juuling again. I have been buying a four pack of pods and going through them within two days, but I share with my boyfriend, he gets two I get two. But I've noticed my gums are not in the best condition and neither are my teeth, and I really want to quit but I am finding it VERY hard. As I am typing I am hitting it, and every time I look in the mirror at my teeth I get upset yet I still can't quit for some reason. I look online and I find nothing helpful to quit. So please, if anybody has any tips, please leave them. I am desperate to quit...

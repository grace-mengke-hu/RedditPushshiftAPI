Blow by blow account of a quit

Hello all, i have noticed lots of people asking when what happens/ends during a quit. I also looked for something similar eith no success so i decided to start a blog chroniclesofaquitterblog.wordpress.com . Admittedly I am only on day 13 but there is 13 posts, and I will continue to update every day. If other people add their experiences in the comments, thus blog can become a useful tool to new quitters.  Thank you

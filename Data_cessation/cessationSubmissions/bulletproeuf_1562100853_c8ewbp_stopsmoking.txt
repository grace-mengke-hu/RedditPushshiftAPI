Is hookah/shisha cheating?

Brief context: I quit five days ago and I’m having very little struggle due to the fact that I’d only been smoking for less than a year, only two months of which I was smoking more than three cigarettes per day.

I’m going to a country known for its hookah/shisha culture, and I’m going with a good friend of mine. This friend and I also have a tradition of sorts regarding hookah, as we used to do it every weekend as teenagers (I was not addicted to nicotine then).

I’d love to join him, but I’m worried it might fuck up my quit attempt. Even though I’ve not had much trouble thus far, I’m worried it may have a psychological impact on me.

The good news is that I’d only do it once or maybe twice, and due to how impractical it is to do it often it wouldn’t be like getting a pack of cigs cause I wouldn’t be able to let it snowball. Once I’m back in my home country I would stop altogether.

What do you guys think? It’s not so much me craving nicotine (although the head rush will be nice), but mostly just wanting to spend some time doing as Romans do with my good friend.

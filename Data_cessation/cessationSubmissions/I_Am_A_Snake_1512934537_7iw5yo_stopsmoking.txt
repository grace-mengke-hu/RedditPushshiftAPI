How I quit!

Hey folks, I smoked cigs daily for about 3 years, then off and on for a while after I started the quitting process. I know that's not too long by compared to most here probably but I thought I'd go ahead and share how I stopped.

After I committed to quitting, I found I struggled most with the thought of "I can't have one" which made me want one even more than I ordinarily would. So instead of trying some cold turkey approach or slow tapering off strategy where I would be really reliant on my self control, I bought a pack of whatever cigarettes I hated most (usually some God awful low shelf camels or similar), and left them in the dash of my car at all times. This way they got dry and awful and the longer they stayed the worse they got. Then any time I wanted a smoke, they were right there.... I could have one any time I wanted. I tried that 3 or 4 times and choked and gagged and wanted to die and it quickly lost its appeal. So it was more about making the thing I enjoyed so much very unenjoyable. As I smoked less, my tolerance got lower and my lungs healthier (I'm a gym goer, helps a lot) one hit off of one of those dashboard cigarettes and I would damn near throw up.

I haven't smoked in about 2 years now and don't have an interest in going back. Some real shit hit the fan in my life a few weeks ago and I bought a pack and chain smoked about 4 til I almost pass out. The pack has been sitting in my room for 2 or 3 weeks now and I don't even consider touching them. I don't feel tempted at all. I don't think about them. I don't even notice them. My body just doesn't want them anymore. 

So anyhow everyone's susceptibility to addiction is different blah blah blah if it helps it helps. I wish you luck!

Relapsing a part of the process?

Hi reddit, would like your thoughts on relapsing after quitting smoking. Just want to start off by saying that I am 27 and I had been smoking for the past 15 years or so, small habbit turned into about 15 - 20 per day over the past decade.

Im really happy to say that I have not had a ciggy in 2 months (today). My Mrs still smokes and I still occasionally get this huge, almost unbearable urge to steal one off her and sneak out. I wouldn't say the craving is for a whole smoke, just a couple puffs. 

Anyway in NZ there is an advertisement on the TV for a stop smoking help line. This ad stipulates that relapsing is a completely normal part of the quitting smoking process. Now in my mind, I see ciggys as just as addictive as some illicit drugs. 

I am willing to say, the only thing that has got me this far is by constantly telling myself that I'm not weak, I'm  stronger than that etc, and relapsing is not a normal thing to do. I see it as common, but I wont consider it normal.

What do you think? Is it normal? Should it be considered normal and I'm just being a bit ignorant about it? 

DISCLAMER: I don't mean anything in a bad way to anyone that's relapsed, this is just what I have to keep telling myself in order to not start again... it helps me get the truck on with it.

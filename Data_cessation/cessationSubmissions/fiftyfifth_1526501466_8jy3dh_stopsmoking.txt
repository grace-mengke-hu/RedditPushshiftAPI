Update, over a week

I just wanted to brag about going &gt;7 days. I had strep throat earlier this year and managed to only quit for 3 days during that time. Insane what this addiction does.

I've "quit" smoking before but so far this has been the easiest run. Part of the reason is I decided to dust off my copy of Easy Way to Stop Smoking by Allen Carr, which I never actually read. Here is one of my favorite realizations, thanks in part to the book:

As a smoker you are always experiencing withdrawals. This blew my mind to think of, but its definitely true for me. Even while smoking a cigarette I would be thinking about smoking the next cigarette. Every social experience is polluted with the question "when are we going out for a smoke?". Every feeling of discomfort is exaggerated by the need to smoke, but smoking doesn't cure the social anxiety, boredom, concentration problem. In fact, it may have helped cause those feelings in the first place. When you realize that nicotine is causing the problem it solves; when you realize cigarettes aren't actually relaxing or helpful, it suddenly it seems so pointless.

Thanks for the support so far r/stopsmoking, I'm not out of the water yet but I think I have a better mindset this time around and so far this has been a breeze.

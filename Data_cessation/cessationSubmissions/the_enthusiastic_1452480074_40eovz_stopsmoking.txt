Day 2 since I quit after reading Allen Carr's method

Hi All,

It's my second day since I've quit. After reading Allen Carr's easy way, I'm feeling quite easy to go and not having  any withdrawal effect, till now.

Is there anyone else on the forum who has tried Allen's way. I've quit for good and not doubting my decision. Just wanted to hear some experience.

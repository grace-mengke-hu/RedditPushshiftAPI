19/Male, just joined and I’m 2 weeks and a few days off cigarettes!

I’ve been feeling pretty down ever sense I quit smoking cigarettes but, I always strive and look towards the future.. but, lately I’ve just been not feeling the best... my pap pasted away about a month ago and it just kinda kills me everyday to not hear his voice and look at his smile. He was such a good person at heart, it upsets me because a lot of times in my mind I feel like I use his death as an excuse to smoke cigarettes... life’s just really depressing at the moment and I was hoping to maybe be able to get some good advice on how to stick without cigarettes!

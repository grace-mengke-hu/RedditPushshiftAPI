1st day quitting

I've been smoking for 5 years now, not smoked for about 12 hours. It's going easy so far, but I'm quitting in the most stupid way possible though. No patches, no gum. Every time i feel like smoking i do a set of weights and hit myself to re wire the habit to pain instead of pleasure. I quit smoking weed last year (which was really easy, just went cold turkey and didn't care), then i quit alcohol (wasn't really a drinker anyway, maybe 1 bottle of spirits a month). But quitting cigs is taking so much more willpower, even more due to the fact i've failed to quit before.

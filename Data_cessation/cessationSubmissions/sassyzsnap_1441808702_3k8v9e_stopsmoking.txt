The flu and my father's birthday.

Earlier this year, I decided that I wanted my "quit day" to be my father's birthday (Sept. 10). I guess because I wanted extra accountability and knew that disappointing him by smoking again isn't something I wanted to do.

Earlier this week, I came down with the flu. The first couple days, I tried smoking. Dear God it was awful.

Yesterday, I didn't smoke. Even when my significant other asked if I wanted to go smoke before bed, I decided no, that I didn't want to.

I've been a smoker for 5 and a half years, about a pack a day, and I've been smoke-free for an entire day.

Here's day 2.

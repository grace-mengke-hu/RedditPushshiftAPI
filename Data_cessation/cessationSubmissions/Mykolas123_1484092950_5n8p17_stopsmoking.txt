Im only 18 and I already got to the point where I can't quit smoking ( this is just venting basicly)

So i've been smoking for 1,5 years now and I decided that puting that fucking chemicals and shit into my body doesn't do any good to me. The longest I ever went without smoking was 5 days and I was stupid enough to buy a pack of cigarettes and think that I would not go back to it. My parents know that I smoke, and they let me smoke in the boiler room at our basement, though they encourage me to quit of course. I feel very uncomfortable when my mom or dad see's me going to the basement or also when I buy cigarettes in 2 day periods. I smoke half a pack everyday but I try my best to make the amount of cigs I smoke smaller.

 I believe that if I could keep myself occupied through out the whole day, everyday, I could quit smoking easily. I mostly smoke because I only sit at the house and it's just very boring, and the idea of having a smoke to me is like a christmas present, I constantly wait for it, it's exciting. Though after I smoke it doesn't feel like anything special, just fucking nicotine and smoke in my body. 

Also, at some point I was got very deppressed because of quitting school, so it made me smoke even more. Right now Im overall quite lonely, I barely have any contact with my old school friends and I feel stupid that my ex girlfriend seems to be so much better without me. I start having these kind of thoughts when I feel nicotine withdrawal and It triggers me to smoke.

Right now I have a pack with 10 cigs on them, i'll try to make it my last pack and go cold turkey, no matter how deppressed I will feel during the period...I just can't keep smoking for the rest of my life. 

Anyway, wish me luck, and I really hope this post will make you motivated to quit if you are trying to, and to stay away from cigs if you havent smoked for a long time

3 Months Quit

I'm "officially" a successful ex-smoker (studies determining success rates often use 3 months as the cut off point).  Of course I still get cravings but they're getting further an further apart.  I also at first relied on vaping, but my use of that is getting further and further apart too (as a matter of fact, I can't remember when I last vaped - mybe a week ago?).

This is the furthest I've gotten!

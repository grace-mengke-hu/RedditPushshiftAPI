Marijuana helped me quit smoking and alcohol.

I recently quit smoking and alcohol cold turkey and have been feeling great and wanted to share what worked for me and may work for others too. I will keep it short.

I was an alcoholic for 8 months (Bottle of whisky each night) and a smoker for 10 years (half a pack a day). I smoked weed for the first time 6 months ago for recreation not to quit alcohol and cigarette. The positive side effect for me was less cravings for both cigarettes and alcohol (I pretty much stopped getting cravings in a week) and it helped a lot with the alcohol withdrawals. 

I am not sure if this was just my experience or others have experienced the same thing. Would like to know if weed helped anyone else as well.

PS. Not encouraging use of Marijuana and if you're having widhrawals you should definitely see a doctor.

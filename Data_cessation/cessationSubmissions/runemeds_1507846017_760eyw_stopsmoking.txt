When does it get the hardest?

 I'm on day 4 of my journey to quit smoking and I was wondering when your hardest days were in the beginning were?

I've yet to experience anything negative, and it's as if I never smoked in my life (except for somewhat poor sleep) and my biggest fear is this is all suddenly and unexpectedly going to punch me in the back of the head.

I really wanna be prepared for that. When was your worst peak? 

I've been about 15 cigarettes a day for 4 years. Not as heavy as I could have been thankfully!

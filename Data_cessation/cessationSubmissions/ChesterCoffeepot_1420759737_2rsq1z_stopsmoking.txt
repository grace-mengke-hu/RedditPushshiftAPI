Smoking dream and cold symptoms.

Was one of those dreams that seemed so real. I was SO disappointed that I gave in and started smoking again. It took a few moments after awaking from this dream to realize that it was just a dream and I was still smoke free. What a relief. I am in the midst of terrible cold and congestion though. Not sure if this congestion is related to having stopped smoking or not.

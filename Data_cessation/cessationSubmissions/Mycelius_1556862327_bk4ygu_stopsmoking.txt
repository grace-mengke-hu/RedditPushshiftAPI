3 Days no smoke on boat, happy big big

I work on a boat in the Bering Sea and everybody here smokes. I have been a daily smoker of around a pack a day for seven years and haven't been without a cigarette or hitting a vape for more than a day in around 3 years. I was sitting in the galley and felt like I needed a cigarette and saw I only had one left. I got furious at the fact that I needed them so bad. I said this is the last time I ever use nicotine and this righteous fury has been keeping me going for three days. Every time I get a craving I give away a piece of smoking paraphernalia and the craving is gone like that. Yesterday was horrible and everybody told me I looked like death walking, but today I feel amazing. Every time somebody offers me a cigarette I crush it instead of smoking it because it feels better to see the look on their face than it would be to smoke it, and I'm not sure I could say no. I really hope this feeling lasts, but in my mind it's like internalized that part of my life is over and I'll never use tobacco again. Good luck boys'n'girls.

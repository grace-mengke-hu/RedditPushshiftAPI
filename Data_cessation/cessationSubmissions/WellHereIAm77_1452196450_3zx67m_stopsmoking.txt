Well... Here I am... Trying agin to quit smoking

Hey! So tomorrow (friday janurary 8th) will be my quitting day. 

I'm just glad I found this sub so I can have a little boost. I've been posting on another one with (alcholism. yay....) but for me, the 2 are linked.

When I drink, I smoke. So quitting drinking will help me (or at least improve my chances!) to quit smoking.

Little back story: I'm in shape. Or rather was considering my calf injury, the Holidays and... well alcohol. 

I used go to the gym 3-4x/week (45-60 mins). I eat well. I'm a nice guy to be around with, i make friends easily. I'm usually a mentally strong guy.... except for this I guess...

I have a stressful job (media/journalism is awesome... but damn), still looking for a new one in another related field (no success yet). I've been stuck with this one for the last 8 years (different places but same job), no GF (the last one was a year ago and it wasn't that serious) or stable relationships (You know, some flirt here and there...). I got some friends, but they aren't close enough.

I just want to be healthy, I know I can do it. I didn't smoke one for a week and a half (I was at my parents home) and it didn't bother me at all. Driving the (long!!) way back, is another story... But that time with no cigarettes, it was awesome!

Anyway, here I am, quitting smoking January 8th 2016.

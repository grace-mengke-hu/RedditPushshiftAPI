Advice on stopping, need help badly

So I have been a smoker since I was 14 (sketchy smoke shop nearby sold them to me with no trouble). I am currently 24 so I have been a pack a day smoker for ten years. I'm finding that I am wheezing when I lay down at night and that was a wake up call. I'm done coughing up crap, I'm done spending $50 a week for smokes, just want to stop this horrible habit. 

I am asking for help because I use smoking as a relaxing activity and I am also Bipolar (medicated) and worry quitting is going to make me depressed and anxious. Do you guys have any tips or advice on how to stop this? I really really want to quit. 

Side note: I had my lower left lung removed two years ago due to valley fever so quitting is something I really should do but I am weak and have no freaking willpower. 

Any advice helps, sorry for rambling guys.

Stopped smoking 45 days ago. Anxiety and Depression have become more intense.

Hey guys,

I started smoking when I was 15 (currently 32 years old). About 2/3 a pay per day (15 cigarettes). I have been diagnosed with ADHD, comorbidities: Anxiety and Depression.

I quit about 6 weeks ago, cold turkey. I am proud but my mental health related symptoms have gotten worse. Is this still in the realm of “normal?”

Thanks to all who reply and have a nice day!

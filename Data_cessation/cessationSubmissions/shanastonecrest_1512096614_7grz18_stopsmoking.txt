Day 5-6 cravings are super bad

I'm going cold turkey,  and the first few days weren't so bad.  Now I'm in day 5 going into 6 and all I can do is fantazie about going to the store and buying cigarettes. I'm not cause I'm in bed,  but I want to so bad...  Just venting.. I'm scared my feeling when I wake up tomorrow

Did you know that I can whistle?

When I was a kid, I could whistle really loud and call the dogs home. For some reason, I haven't been able to do that for the last few years. I thought it was all of the Mountain Dew that I was drinking, but after I stopped drinking sodas and started drinking water I still couldn't whistle. I really thought it would come back after I got myself hydrated again, and I was a bit disappointed that I couldn't.

This afternoon I was trying to get one of my dogs to come in and... I whistled. Really loud too. I was kind of surprised that I did it and thought maybe it was a fluke. I did it again, and another time just to be positive.

The damn dog still didn't listen, but at least I can whistle again. Also, have a serious issue at work that's stressing me out. I thought about going out for a cigarette immediately but stopped, took a deep breath, and am dealing with it without a cigarette. Also, I choose to focus on the fact that I can whistle again.

Who'd have thought... smoking causes you to not be able to whistle.

Who said quitting was easy? Stay strong quitters! :)

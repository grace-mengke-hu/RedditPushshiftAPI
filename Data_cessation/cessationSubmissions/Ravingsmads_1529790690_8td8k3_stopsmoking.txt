Yesterday I got totally drunk but still didn't relapse :D!

Hello,

I smoked a pack a day for 5 years. Red L&amp;M mind you. And I quit 6 days ago cold turkey.

Yesterday I hanged out with 2 heavy smoker friends. And we got drunk. As in really drunk. The cravings were bad and I almost started rationalizing just one cigarette. But I kept repeating the mantra "Not one puff, no matter what". And it's the only thing that anchored me.

The best news? I convinced both friends to quit, because I used to smoke twice the amount they smoked and if I can do it they can. One already started and the other is starting next week.

Now I have another reason to stay clean, as I'm advising them on how to quit and it would be shattering for them if I picked it up again.

Fuck smoking.

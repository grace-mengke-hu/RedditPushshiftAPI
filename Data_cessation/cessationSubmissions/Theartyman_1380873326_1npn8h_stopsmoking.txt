24 smoke free and a new feeling about life.

Just had to pop in as I have been reading every ones comments for a long time.
Well I'm normal at last .a ex smoker .i used to smoke 12.5 of drum a day for god knows how long.was a smoker for 23 years and remember the days when I used to have just one once a week.don't know how it changed bit I have finally given up.
It seems I have so much more life and not thinking about my next smoke!!.the way I did it was to stop my timing.i was a morning smoker and it was the first thing I did in the morning .giving this up and changing my habits .timing worked.i ate food .smelled flowers.anything but a cig.then after cutting down I went on tablets.
There is no thing as a last cig.its all to do with your mind .i love standing next to smokers and just watching them.i had a photo of me smoking that made me look terrible.i now stand tall as I'm not bending over to roll a fag.

Just hope this helps.if I can do it after 23 years you can do it.you just need to get your mind in that frame.and thank you all for reading.

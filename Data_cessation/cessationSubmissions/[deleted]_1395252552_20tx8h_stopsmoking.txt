I'm done. Forever, this time.

I thought it wouldn't be a big deal to smoke one while hanging out with my mom. Then it became one after work, then when before work, then one during work...Now I'm almost as bad as the when I quit the first time. I may not be smoking a pack a day anymore, but I feel like utter shit. My chest hurts, and my sense of taste and smell are going away again. I feel gross, even if it's just a few a day.

I can't keep doing this. I'm fucking done. Forever. Not even when drinking, or with friends, or whatever. I want to be healthy and become a runner and lose weight and be happy, and smoking isn't going to make that goal any easier to achieve.

So here's to day 1.

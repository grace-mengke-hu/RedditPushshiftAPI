24 hours cigerette free, no idea if I can do this for a long time

Well let's just say that I used to smoke alot, no more than a pack a day though, never even thought about quitting because I actually liked smoking, and whenever someone asks me if I could quit I proudly respond saying that I'm not even addicted and I can stop whenever I want but deep down I know that I depend on nicotine too much, well yesterday I had an epiphany, a sudden desire to stop stop smoking started running through my vains, I had a couple of cigs left that I through away (first time I ever do that) and tried to forget all about smoking, but today was too hard, I mean when you smoke you feel like your daily activities revolve around smoking, anyway I kept it together but I felt like talking to someone about this so who's better than our fellow ex-smoker, but tomorrow is a mistery and I don't even have a plan to how should I follow through, ny insight would be highly appreciated, thank you very much
P.S: this is my first post on this sub and hopefully not the last

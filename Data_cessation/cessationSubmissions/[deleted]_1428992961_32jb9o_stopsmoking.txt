Lurker that quit smoking one month ago in need of some help!

I'm having trouble dealing with emotional down swings and I feel like I'm never going to get my emotional balance back without cigarettes.  It feels like I should have had a better grip on things a month out.  Any advice will be greatly appreciated.  Also thanks for listening to my woes.

Roommates and Blunts

Not sure if this is the right sub, but here goes. I'm having a hard time staying away from cigarettes lately and it's because my roommates keep smoking blunts in our garage (which is right next to my room). It's driving me crazy, and they know it. Sure they cut back from the "every day is blunt day" crap they did over the last three months, but it still drives me crazy when they wait two weeks and then smoke them every other day. I would not have moved in if I knew it was this frequent (they rarely did it around me when I wasn't living here so I had no idea).

I just needed to get that out to some people who would understand how much it fucking sucks to smell tobacco right outside their door. I almost caved last night and talking here helps. Thanks.

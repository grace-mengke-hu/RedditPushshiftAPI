A smoker for 5 months and I have decided to finally quit. I need some help.

I had decided to quit a lot of times before, but I never really had the motivation to do so. But now, I have decided to stop for good before I get any more addicted. I do approximately 3 a day (sometimes 4) evenly spaced out throughout the day. 

I know I haven't been addicted for too long, and it may be relatively easy to quit.

For those of you who were in the same situation as I am - what are the withdrawal symptoms at this stage? How easy is it to quit and what can I do to make sure I never touch another cigarette?

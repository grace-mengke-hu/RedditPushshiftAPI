So how have you been the last few days?  
I've been a non smoker for [11 days and 15 hours](https://i.imgur.com/l9pbICC.png) now. It's getting easier, but I still notice the old habits. I have not had any cravings on day 9 and 10, but day 11 was hard. We had a friend over, also a non smoker, but we played some videogames and I noticed the habit that made me want to smoke in between rounds. So I counted about 4 cravings altogether. It made me realise that just because I've been a non smoker for almost two weeks now, my brain isn't rewired and it'll take a very long time to not long for a smoke during activities where I'd normally have one.

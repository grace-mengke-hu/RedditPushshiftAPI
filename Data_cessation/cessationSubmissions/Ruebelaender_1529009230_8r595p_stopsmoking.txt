Addiction is a strange thing

Haven't smoked a cigarette for 73 days and it was quite easy. Up until now. I started thinking of smoking about an hour ago and now I struggle with myself to not go outside and buy a pack. This shit is killing me right now. The fact that it was no big deal for me to stay away from cigarettes makes it even harder, because my brain is telling me I can easily stop after I smoked one pack or so. Good thing I know it might be harder next time, so I will stay strong!

Sorry, if there are any language mistakes which make it hard to understand, I am no native speaker and my brain is not working well right now :D but I needed to share this to someone in the hope it makes me feel better. Felt like it took me hours to write this few sentences.

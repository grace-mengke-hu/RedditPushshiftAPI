Quitting

Hey guys, 

I am 22 years old, been smoking for four years.

Here is a thing, i've tried quitting couple months ago and failed it, but three weeks ago i decided (along with my friend, who failed to continue after second week) to only smoke on Friday and Saturday (that's when i drink quite a lot of alcohol).

There goes my question:

Has anybody tried something like this?

Is it possible to continue this routine in speaking of the long term?

Will i be healthier, or it will not affect my health?

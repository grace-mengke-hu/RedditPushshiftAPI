2 months and i rode up a hill

And then i ran up some stairs! Then i ran up some more! Then i raced over to pick up my kids from school! So i ran up more stairs (like 4 flights!!!). Then i got my bike, raced to the market, did some shopping, raced home, then raced to another appointment!!! I didn't take a single break in like 7 hours,!?!!?!? Usually i took one every 30 mins!!?!? Soooo happy and grateful to my body. I'm a friggin AMAZON

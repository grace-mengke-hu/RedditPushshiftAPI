AIHOs from thinking about smoking after quitting smoking?

AIHOs - Attention Induced Head Orgasms - are occurrences where you feel a tingly pleasant sensation in your head. It feels fucking awesome.

I quit smoking eleven days ago and now whenever I think about someone smoking or having a smoke I get these. Definitely worth quitting just for this feeling.

Anyone else get this? o_O

I think I have everything to quit smoking except self control.

I would love to quit smoking, I just went to my neighborhood store called puff puff pass. I've tried this before with no avail, so this time I decided if I just got everything I could possibly need I would be able to muster the self control eventually. Here's what I got, let me know if I need anything else. 2 pack a day Marlboro Reds, 4 hours no analogue nicotine.

1 Ego cTwist 900 battery, 1 generic 1100 battery, 1 charging cable, 2X kanger miniProtank 3, 1 case, 1 vile of 12miligram ejuice.

I intentionally left my cigarettes in the car, and I want one kinda bad before bed so I'm going to hit some pushups. 

I just wanted to know if I had everything I needed to quit smoking, and what tools you all could donate to me in terms of advice for self control.

Thank you!

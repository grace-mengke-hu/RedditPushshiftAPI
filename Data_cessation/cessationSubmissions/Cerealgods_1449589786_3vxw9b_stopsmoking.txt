3 months and counting

Hello /r/stopsmoking, I've lurked for quite some time, but wanted to share my experience with this community. 

Today is day 90 for me. I smoked and chewed for around 8 years and have attempted to quit several times. The last two attempts.  I read Allen Carr's "Easyway". I wasn't ready to quit last time and picked it back up after a couple weeks. This is the longest I've gone without nicotine.

Sometimes I find myself missing it but I try to remind my self there is a reason I decided to quit. Allen Carr's book really helped me put those kinds of thoughts into perspective. 
I don't really know what else to say, except thanks for being here and supporting people like me.

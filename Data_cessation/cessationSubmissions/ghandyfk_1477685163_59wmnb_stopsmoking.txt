Rewards for the first week?

Hey all. I'm a 31 y.o. guy, I smoke for 10 years now. Average about 14 cigs/day. But next Monday is my quit date. I'm quitting together with my dad (cigars). 
I'm looking forward to it and I'm inspired by all the posts here on Reddit.

I plan on rewarding myself every day during the first week. I'll definitely get myself a nice steak after the first 24 or 48 hours of not smoking. Still thinking about little rewards for the other days though.

Have you guys installed some sort of rewards system during the first week or month of quitting? Any suggestions for a daily reward?

Well, I blew it guys. 

Quit for 9 months, and started up again the final two weeks of the fall semester thinking I could stop as soon as i made it through finals. A month later and I went from no smokes to smoking over half pack a day in the blink of an eye. I am resetting my badge tomorrow and starting the journey once again. For those of you who have quit for a week, a few weeks, or months..stick with it. I have never been so disappointed with myself and I hope you all never have to feel this pain of regret and failure. Ill be checking back in here for support as you all were a crucial component of my previous successes.

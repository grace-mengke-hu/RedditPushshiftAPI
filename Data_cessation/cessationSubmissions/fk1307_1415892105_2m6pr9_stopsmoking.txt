A smoke filled mind (also, 1000 not smoked ciggies)

Sorry for the wall of below-mediocre-English, but none of my friends understand what I'm going through. And please don't get me wrong. 

I was thinking about my old self and the first days of quitting. (Warning, I might make smoking look fancy, but just read untill the end)

Since I stopped smoking I missed out on things. I couldn't bond with people over the perks of being a smoker. I couldn't whine about the smoking room being way too small, or outside being way too cold. I couldn't ask a random cutie for a lighter. I missed out on buying another drink, just to wash away the lovely ashtray taste in my mouth. 

Also, what is living without a mini heart attack everytime I need to run to catch my train. It just makes me feel so alive, so yolo. That pain in your chest is stressful, right? Smoke another one, you know, to relax.

Really, I miss having money to burn and actually burning it. I miss my old priorities, tobacco first, food second. 

Also, what a bliss ignorance is. Yes, saying the wise words "well smoking might kill me, but hey, I don't wanna be superold anyway!" made me feel so smart, so edgy.

Honestly, this is complete utter bullshit, but even more honest: this was my mindset just 41 days ago. Nicotine is one hell of drug to be addicted to. I saw my addiction as an innocent part of my personality , just like alcoholics say "I just like the taste of wine!".

Life without smoking is fun. I get to spend money on fun stuff, I dont smell and taste like an ashtray, my skin is allmost flawless! I'm 20 and I saw my first little wrinkles, I also saw them fade away.

To all of you who just started: This might look like the worst decision in your life, because it's hard and you're really moody right now, but it will get better.

You can do it.

Quitting-Smoking-Sex

happy thanksgiving. I am really trying to stop smoking. I am 24- started smoking at 19. I have tried everything to stop.  I once read that if you quit smoking, you can get harder, fuller, whatever you want to fucking say- erections.  So lately I have started seeing this girl, Emily, and the thought that I could have better sex with her (potentially) if I were to stop smoking, seems like something that I could try to rally behind (hey now).  If anyone of you have anything you are willing to share with regards to better intimacy (is it right away? etc.) I would appreciate it.

Day 16: Benefits

I am a New Year quitter and I just wanted to share some of the things that I have seen to be benefits from quitting smoking so far. I thought this might be interesting for people who have quit more recently, or people who might be having a hard time. 

* Breathing is so much better

I started the quit with a chest infection. The infection has cleared out now and I have found that through stopping smoking my breathing has improved greatly. I now feel as though I can take long, deep breaths - relaxing and reassuring.

* Easier to run

A corollary of the last point, but running is MUCH easier. I only started running again last week but found that I am far less restricted by my breathing than I have been in the past

* Saved money

I have spent Â£0.00 on cigarettes since quitting (no surprises) but it  has saved me a pretty penny. I don't really know how much I used to spend because I smoked roll ups but it was a lot and I am glad to be free of it. 

* Sense of smell is improved

I feel as though I am smelling things everywhere! I can't get over the smell of my hair or of my fabric conditioner - it smells goood and is a constant reminder that I am doing the right thing. 

* I don't smell

Another thing I'm noticing with the hair is that it smells of shampoo/ conditioner, rather than of an old ash tray. I would notice, but wouldn't really care about the extent to which tobacco smoke lingers in everything and stinks it up.

* Improvement to gums

I have noticed that my gums are looking healthier and aren't bleeding when I brush. This was something that I was worried about and which caused me anxiety.

* Improved sleep

Towards the end, the fact that I smoked was really getting me down and I would wake in the night and feel guilty about it. 

* Lower stress levels

I think wanting to quit for a long time and feeling as though I should was providing me with a low level, continuous stress in my life. The health consequences and other negatives were always sitting at the back of my mind and increasing anxiety. Quitting has helped me to lower general stress levels through eliminating this underlying stresser. It has been replaced by feeling proud of my achievements. It is also less stressful if someone is coming over because I used to smoke in my flat and then needed to go through a whole "de-smokification" process before any family came. ugh. 

* No longer ashamed of my habit

When I was younger, all my friends smoked. Over the years the smokers have become fewer and fewer and I have started to feel like a numpty excusing myself to smoke

* I have more time

I didn't really realise how much time smoking took up. Pretty much every task needed to have a couple of cigarette breaks incorporated, meaning everything took longer than it should have done. Now it's easier to get stuff done. This was a surprise to me as I never really thought about how much TIME I was wasting. 

* Improved skin

I noticed within the first week or so that my skin had improved, becoming smoother and softer. I also feel as though I sweat less when exercising? 

I'm sure that there have been many other benefits but these are the ones that I could think of off the top of my head. It hasn't all been easy-going - I have had a short temper and have eaten A LOT of sweets. I hope that some of these things can be of comfort to anyone just starting out and feeling disheartened, or anyone thinking of quitting.

What changes have you noticed since quitting?

The urge is real!

Hey guys, just posting to get some support or feedback. I’ve been smoke-free for just about 4 months. Lately, I’ve been feeling super depressed and feel like smoking is better than feeling like this mentally. Has anyone had this? Just very low motivation to do anything. Everything seems like a hurdle. Thanks in advance!

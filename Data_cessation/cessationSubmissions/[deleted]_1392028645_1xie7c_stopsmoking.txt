Only 9 days in. Chronic Insomnia is ruining my life.

I've been a half a pack a day smoker for about a decade now. About a week ago while being "active" with my girlfriend I had to stop because I couldn't breath. That was enough to finally get me to quit cold turkey. I really want to stick to it this time but I feel like I'm losing my damn mind and that I'm just going to be miserable for the rest of my life. Sorry for the rant.

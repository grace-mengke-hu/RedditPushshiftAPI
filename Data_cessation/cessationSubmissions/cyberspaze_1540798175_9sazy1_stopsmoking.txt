Pregnant, so it's time, yet don't feel the desire to quit

I'm not sure what to do, everyone is on one hand telling me to quit and how bad it is for my baby, on the other hand there's people telling me they smoked all through pregnancy and nothing bad ever happened, and if I want to I should just do what I feel like.

I'm about 5 months pregnant now and I've been smoking the entire time, except for the first month. I quit after a throat surgery for a month because I physically could not smoke whatsoever. I decided there and then that I would keep it that way and stay smoke free, but the first night out on holiday I had a few shots and picked it back up fairly quickly. I did not know I was pregnant at that time. 

So far the baby is doing fine, developping fine, and has no abnormalities.

Please convince me to quit smoking, I haven't smoked today yet but I'm thinking of getting some soon. 

Thanks guys.

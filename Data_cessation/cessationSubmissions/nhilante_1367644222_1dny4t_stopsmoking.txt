Running as a motivator

I did not think about stopping smoking or slowly smoking less but i knew that one day i would. I recently started running 3 to 4 times a week to get my mind off things and overall get healthier. I'm also trying to gain weight but not fat and live close to a beautiful park. First few days i had pain breathing when my heart rate was high for long periods so i had to take regular walking breaks in my runs. I've also started smoking less. Now this is the catchy part, i am not smoking less because i wanted to stop smoking, i'm smoking less because it tastes bad after i work-out to the level where i don't want to smoke a cigarettes because i keep remembering the breathing breaks in my runs. It's as if my body is subconsciously rejecting the idea of smoking because it knows better than i do. Two birds with one stone.
I wanted to share this with you guys who still enjoy smoking and can't find a method to smoke less. Be active and run or work out the body takes care of the rest. (partially ofc)

A recent discovery reaffirmed that I'll never smoke again

Today as I was carrying my bike up a flight of stairs, my bike's  handlebars bent and clamped down on my thumb. Within five minutes, my thumb had expanded to double its size. From experience, I knew my hand would bruise, that a wound would form and that I would probably experience tingling in my hand for a few hours. 

Much to my little non-smoker brain's surprise, my skin has completely repaired itself in a matter of hours thanks to **proper circulation** and a **strengthened immune system**. Quitting smoking has shown me how resilient my powerhouse of a body is. and I am so. goddamn. happy. 

see you never, cigs!

Not my first time quitting, I think this will be my last time

I am determined this time. I created a new account, I dread looking at the ild accoint as ny badge would be over a year, but I relapsed after a couple of months.
This time I am dedicated to never smpking another cigarette.
I will be checking in here frequently! !

Just wrapping up day 2...here comes the fun part ðŸ˜£




Think Iâ€™ll just go to bed super early every night just to get through this first wk. UGH. Been here before, many times, but Iâ€™ve always failed around the 3 month mark. Iâ€™m a 14 year smoker.  Didnâ€™t even start smoking until my mid 20â€™s. How stupid lol. And here I am closing in on 40. 
So stupid. Lol. But anyway. 
This time Iâ€™m PREPARED and am using tools, like books and the stop smoking app and this group, to help when times get tough. Iâ€™ve always done it alone and Iâ€™ve always let cigs get the best of me. Iâ€™ve been visiting this forum for a little over a month now and honestly, seeing everyoneâ€™s posts and advice and knowledge has made me EXCITED to try again! Excited to get involved! Iâ€™ve always been super introverted and not spoken to people about personal aspects of my life, much less about smoking/quitting, so Iâ€™m super impressed with r/stopsmoking. I love how open and honest it is, and supportive, and am looking forward to getting through this with the peeps who are right here with me or have already conquered this wicked vice. I just want to be free! I think thatâ€™s what we all want. One day at a time. 
Day 2 is gonna turn into Day 3 and then Day 30. Then 3000. It can and will be done. Lord willin and the creeks donâ€™t rise...

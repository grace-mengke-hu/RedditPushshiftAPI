Almost 3 years now, after 30+ smoking years, and I have been wondering " What Worked?"

I can sum it up because in these last (almost) 3 years when I have faced temptation from my addiction- here's what made the difference:

The reasons I quit have nothing to do with the reasons I smoked.

Let that sink in....

Quitting because I would get cancer did not reach me- because I didn't start smoking expecting cancer prevention. Did I ?

Quitting because of cost did not reach me- after all, I never started smoking as a means to save money, did I ?

So why was I smoking? Guess what? That's the key!!!

All the reasons I was smoking were pretty obvious to me- ----  advantage to concentrate. ...Advantage to relax. ...Advantage to be social... advantage of liking the taste or smell.

Guess what- take those "advantages" apart- one by one - right here. 
And dare to see the truth! That is the KEY THING that has kept me smoke free all this time!!

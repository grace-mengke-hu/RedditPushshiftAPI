I need to quit smoking. To do that, I need to stop smoking weed and drinking.

I can smoke without drinking or getting high, but if I smoke weed or drink, my resolve is weakened, and it's likely that I will start smoking again. Since October, I've stopped smoking five times, for weeks or months months at a time. It's a cold beer or a toke always brings me back, even when I drink or toke for weeks without incident. I need to stop all of them at once.

Maybe this sounds like an impossible standard, but I stopped in 2000 by quitting everything. I started drinking again in 2005, but I only started smoking again in 2010, and I only started smoking weed again in 2013. I need to stop everything again, this time around.

My plan is to quit on Monday, when I will be absorbed in a daily routine that keeps me exhausted and elated. If you have insight or encouragement to offer, I would be grateful.

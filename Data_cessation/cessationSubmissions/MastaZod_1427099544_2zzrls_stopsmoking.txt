10 days, feeling ok.

It's not the first time that I try to quit smoking. I didn't ever considerate myself as a smoker but... 10 days ago it appears that It has been 5 years smoking 10 cigarets a day and keep saying "naah I'm not". When I realised that... I thought that I was lying to myself. The worst part is that, my girlfriend (if you read that, I Love You Honey and sorry) hates smokers and never never imagine that I was one of them.

I feel very ashamed because of my behaviour. So I'll try to achieve this alone for her, without she knows it in order to be the one she thinks I am.

I hope to be a good person doing this cure.

(Sorry for my english...)

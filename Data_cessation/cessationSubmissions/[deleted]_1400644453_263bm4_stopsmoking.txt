Has anyone kept a day by day quitting log/journal? I need some reassurance that this will get better...

I quit 9 days ago after a 5 year ~15 cigs a day habit, and the first few days were great. I even drank (and got drunk) on a smoking patio this weekend without succumbing to it all.

I am now breaking down. I'm sad as fuck (I was clinically depressed 6 years ago and this is damn well near close to that). Irritable as all hell. Can't focus at work to the point I'm worried about reprimand for doing nothing. 

I've been running 5 km every other day, working out etc. 

But it seems there's been a law of diminishing returns health wise, I don't "feel" better, if anything I feel worse. I need someone else's experiences to better understand what's coming next... Like when do I wake up feeling alive, stop coughing, stop waking up with shit in my throat, when can I run further...

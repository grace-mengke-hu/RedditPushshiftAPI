No increase in energy after ~3 weeks. Almost constant fatigue. Anyone else?

So.
I've been having low energy the last few months and I figured that smoking/chewing probably did not help my energy levels.
I stopped 3 weeks ago. Also stopped caffeine 5 weeks ago or something.
Problem is I feel no different most days, some days are ok I guess but then right back to the afternoon fatigue. In the evenings I sometimes bounce back and feel alert.

Is it too early to tell? I probably should get a doctors appointment soon but I know that all tests will be "normal", been there done that before :)

Any anecdotes?

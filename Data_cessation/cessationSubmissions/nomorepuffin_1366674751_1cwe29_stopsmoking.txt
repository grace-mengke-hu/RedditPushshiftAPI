here we go (again)

Hey gang,

I've been lurking this subreddit for a LONG while, taking a lot of motivation from you all. I read Alan Carr's book, and that combined with all of you wonderful people has me pumped to finally shed myself of this terrible demon. I'm only 21, but I've been smoking a pack a day for ~3 years. I've tried to quit a bunch of times before, and if I make it 2 days on this attempt, that'll be the longest I've gone since I've started without taking a puff. I think I can do it, and I'll be regularly checking in here for all the cravings that'll be a'coming.

Thanks for being here folks, wish me luck!

Hello Day #4!!

Day by day....survived some cravings yesterday. Today is a new day! Let's do this! 

BTW....this sub is great! Love coming here and read stuff. Keep going guys!

This will be a challenge today.. for some reason, I can feel it. I am in this zone now, where my brain starts to nag me with:" Common dude! You are doing great! Have one smoke as a reward! It's been 4 days! You can do it...what does one smoke hurt!?" Ugghhh, been there so many times before. Need to stay strong and keep telling myself that this nicotine drug is almost out of my system and it's all in my head now...not dependency on a drug, it's just in my head.

Felt much better this morning. In such short period of not sucking on lung rockets, my lungs are not wheezing when I wake up, taking deep breaths seems easier too. Food taste different...salty...very salty. My car doesn't stink as much anymore. I cleaned it 4 days ago. It's nice to get in a fresh smelling car! I started to eat healthy too and drink tons of water. It seems like quitting smoking has many other benefits to it, that you would not think it would.

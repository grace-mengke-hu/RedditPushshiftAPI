Update at one week without vaping.

So I can't believe I've hit a week. Over the last few days it's got much, much easier. The best thing for me is that my brain seems to have given up with the games it played which seemed to ruin all my previous attempts. Even though I really wanted to stop, after a few days or a week (or even a month once) my brain used to say "well if this is all there is and you're going to feel miserable anyway, you may as well just accept that's who you are and vape anyway, no need to just punish yourself for life". I don't know why it's different this time but it really is. I'm so relieved to finally KNOW that there's no going back. I didn't expect it to happen so quickly. I'm not moping this time, I'm actually celebrating! Keep up the good fight guys! 

What I've found really helps - 

Using the graph on the quit app so you can see visually how much easier it's getting day by day 

Putting something in the app to save up for. For me it's a new Garmin running watch which I would never have treated myself to before, but in four months time I'll have saved all that vaping money and I absolutely can have it!

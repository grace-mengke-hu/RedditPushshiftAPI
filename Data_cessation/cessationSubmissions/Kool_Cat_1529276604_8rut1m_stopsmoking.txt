Any suggestions on how to quit? Or what have you done that helped you quit?

I turned 25 years old a few days ago and decided for my birthday I’ll give myself what’s left of my lungs back. I’ve been smoking for 10 years (I know.... disgusting). But it’s hit the point where I’m just tired of it, and I honestly find the habit disgusting. I’ve tried to quit several times before, and even managed to make it about a month one time but always managed to get pulled back in somehow. I notice that I have a routine and catch myself smoking at the same times everyday or after certain activities. I honestly think I might have semi OCD and over the years just got addicted to the process rather than the nicotine itself. Biggest problem is when I get bored I smoke because it’s something to do.

What have some of you done in order to quit? I tried going cold turkey, and sometimes it goes really well but I always end up failing. I was never really a vaper and found it kinda pointless, but I’m still thinking about picking up a Juul. I’m afraid that there will be some sort of side effects that come out of it since vaping is still rarely new and there isn’t much research on it, but idk. I just don’t want to drop one habit, pick up another then have to try to quit vaping. Any suggestions?

TLDR: I need suggestions on how to quit. And what have you done that worked for you? Thought about getting a Juul but idk how I feel about picking up on bad habit to drop another. Especially one that isn’t researched that well.

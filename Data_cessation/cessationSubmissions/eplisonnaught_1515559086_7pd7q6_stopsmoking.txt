ChantX and nicotine gum?

Can u get addicted to stuff that helps u quit. I switched to vaping to help quite and I’m addicted to vaping now. I want nicotine out of my life and I know cold turkey isn’t the way to go. I’m thinking about trying nicotine gum, but in afraid I’ll get hooked on that. Do u mind sharing ur own experiences with nicotine gum and patches or any other methods?

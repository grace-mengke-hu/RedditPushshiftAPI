Will this be a constant battle for the rest of my life?

I really just want to light up a cigarette and take a few drags...I won't though, I know that I won't...I just WANT to. I recently was with a friend who quit smoking 4 years ago, but her S.O still smokes heavily. I asked her if she ever craves them being around him and she said every day. My S.O doesn't smoke, but in my social group about 75% of my friends do, so I am around it a lot. So I'm 44 days in, and I still want a cigarette. Advice? Hope?

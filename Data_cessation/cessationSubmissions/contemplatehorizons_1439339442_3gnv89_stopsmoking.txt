One year!

After smoking for nearly a decade I am in slight disbelief I made it 365 without a single cigarette. I am so proud of myself and the subsequent positive changes I have been able to make as a result of quitting smoking. Thank you for all the support during my quit and best of luck and strength to all your current quits!

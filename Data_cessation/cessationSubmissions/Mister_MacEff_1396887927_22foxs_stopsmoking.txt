Adderall?

Any other quitters take Adderall (or other similar meds)? 

I've noticed that when I don't take it my cravings are really easy to ignore, but when I'm medicated they come back with a vengeance.

I guess my question is: do your Adderall cravings stay this intense? I've only been at this for two weeks, so I assume it gets better. 

It's really rough when something I need to do well in school makes me struggle so much.

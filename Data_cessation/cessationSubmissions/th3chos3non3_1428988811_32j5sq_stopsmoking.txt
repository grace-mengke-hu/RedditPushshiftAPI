Nearly six weeks in and may have found a 'fresh' solution to to cravings.

I was up all night working on a school project last night and had some worse cravings than usual and decided I just needed an oral fixation. After tinkering with some rollie filters, a bendy straws, and some peppermint essential oil, I found something that's quelled the urges better than probably anything I've found thus far. It's cheap, smokeless, and tastes like a menthol. Full disclosure: I don't have a clue about the health repercussions of this. That said, to make it, I cut a gizeh filter into thirds. I then cut off a 3 or 4-inch piece from the straw. I squeezed one of the filter thirds into an end of the straw. I then poured probably less than a drop of the essential oil into the open end. A while later I tried diluting the oil with food grade vegetable glycerin, at about 2glyc:1ppmnt ratio and it worked just as well. I then squeezed another third of the filter into the open end of the straw, then used a skewer to shove them together in the middle to avoid getting unnecessary oil on my lips. From there, you just inhale through the straw, though not too hard at first, since you'll want to make sure the filters aren't loose so that you don't choke/burn your lungs with peppermint. If it's well in place, then you're basically all set.

And I realize this is probably going to sound very stupid to quite a few of you, but it gives me that throat hit/controlled lung burn that I miss and they cost almost nothing.

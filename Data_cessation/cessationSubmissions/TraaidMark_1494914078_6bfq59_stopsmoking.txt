Second day.

Yesterday was tough, but it did give me resolve. I am yet to smoke, and it's already 8 am!

Yesterday I realised that I was actually okay throughout the day if I kept a deliberate focus. I also realised that off all the work day triggers, the post-meeting one was a killer. 

It's still happening. Every craving is validation that I am doing this for real, that I'm part of the club, walking along on this journey.

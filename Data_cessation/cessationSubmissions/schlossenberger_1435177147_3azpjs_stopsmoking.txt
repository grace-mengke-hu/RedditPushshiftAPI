Checking in, one year later

Smoked my last cigarette a year ago.  Hard to believe.  Smoked for 11 years, age 16 to 27.  I think the final straw was buying a house and a new car at the same time and money getting tight.  I started rolling and kept that up for nearly a year.  When that got annoying, I couldn't bring myself to going back to spending twice as much on store-bought.  So I came here, got some pointers, and rolled my last.

For what it's worth I didn't use any special tricks to quit. I just stopped.  I was tired of spending the money on it, tired of wasting time going outside, tired of destroying my health.  I had read on here to try that book, Alan Carr's Whatever.  I downloaded the free eBook sample and read like four pages.  Never was a big fan of reading.

My tips are to prepare yourself for success.  Throw everything smoking-related away.  Clean your car really well so you'll feel extra guilty about even thinking about smoking in it again.  I loaded up on gum, mints, hard candy, toothpicks, etc.  Anything to chew on to take your mind off smoking.  At work I would cut coffee stirrers into thirds and chew on them.

For the new quitters - it'll get better.  In time you'll forget about it.  I walk past people smoking outside bars and it's disgusting.  You'll feel the same way soon, and won't dream of picking it back up.

If you're feeling like you might cave, remember all the good benefits of quitting.  One of my biggest motivating factors has been that I love cooking and eating good food, and love good beer and whiskey.  Quitting smoking heightened my sense of smell and taste, and made all those good eats and drinks even better.  That's what makes it worth it for me.  Find what makes it worth it for you, and remember it when you get a craving.

Good luck everyone & keep up the good fight!  Here's to another year!

Question about Pavlovian problems...

We have some *really* expensive equipment at work. Ever since I started working here they've had chimes on the front and back doors. Whenever they're opened they release a decently loud chime.

I've been working here about 3 years now, and 70% of the time the door chimes, it's a co-worker going out back for a cigarette. After 3 years, *every* time I hear the chime of the back door I get an *instant* craving to smoke.

What is the best way to handle this situation? I don't think I can continue to wear my headphones for 8 hours to hide from that fucking chime.

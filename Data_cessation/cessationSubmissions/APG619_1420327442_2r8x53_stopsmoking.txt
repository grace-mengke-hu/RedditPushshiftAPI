My SO Quit Smoking For NYE- please help me support him.

As I mentioned in the title, my SO quit smoking for his NYE resolution.  He just turned 29 and he's been smoking heavily since 13 or 15.  He usually smokes a pack a day and is struggling but kicking ass at the same time.  He's been using the Nicorette Cherry 4mg throat lozenges, which has been extremely helpful.  On the 1st he only smoked 4 cigarettes and on the 2nd he only smoked 5!  Here we are on the 3rd, about 3pm PST in America and he's only had 2!!

He's obviously acting high strung because he's not getting the nicotine his body wants, so I was wondering if you could give me tips to stay supportive while also making sure he sticks to the plan of quitting.  At this time I'm the "holder of the cigarettes" if you will.  I have a couple packs hidden around the bedroom and will give him a cigarette when requested.  He usually asks for one 1-2 hours after he wakes up, around 2:30pm, and again at 6. Whenever he asks, I try and make him wait 30-60 minutes so he gets used to the cravings and doesn't get in right away. He snuck one last night at midnight and covered up his tracks by bringing back take out (I had been asleep but randomly woke up while he was out).  I found the pack hidden in his car and took it because he would have obviously smoked them and lied about it. I told him this morning that I found them and he wasn't mad.  I'm sure he's upset that his plan didn't work, but he's not mad at me for finding out and taking action.

I'm also wondering what I can do to try and lower the amount of lying he feels he has to do when he doesn't overcome a craving and smokes more than he thinks (or he thinks I think) he should... if that makes sense.  Sorry for the sporadic text of thoughts, this is the first time he's serious about quitting and I want to help him any and every way  possible.

Thank you in advance!

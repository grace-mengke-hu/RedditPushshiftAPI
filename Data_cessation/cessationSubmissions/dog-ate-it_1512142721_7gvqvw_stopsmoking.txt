2017-12-09 quit date. Chantix thoughts &amp; experience request

Had my annual physical this morning &amp; the Dr wrote me a script for Chantix. This quit isn't my first quitting rodeo so I pretty much know what to expect except for the Chantix assist.

The Dr told me to expect feelings of nausea and whacked out dreams. From my internet reading about Chantix, it seems like in a week or so smoking should taste like leftover ass and subconscious cravings go away as if by magic.

I'm a 40 year smoker, pack a day. I had 1 solid quit but went back during a post surgery rehab that was pretty painful. You know, because as long as life was in full suck mode I had to make it worse. Lesson learned. 

Thanks in advance.

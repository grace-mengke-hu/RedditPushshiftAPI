smoking is dumb and I am dumb for it

Hey, so I recently just had another bad chest cold and I assume the culprit is once again stupid cigarrettes. I have been a "quitting smoker" for about a year now. I'm really trying to kick the habit for good. Do you guys have any tips to quit smoking? I know my reasoning for smoking is a means to procrastinate on thing I don't want to do. So I know why I do it, now I just need help quitting any advice?

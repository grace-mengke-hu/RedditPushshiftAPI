Got into an accident

Didn't smoke. 

I spun out on the highway and ended up getting my car stuck in a ditch. Tow truck came to lift it out. He lighted a smoke and I was very close to asking him for one to help relieve the stress. 

But I didn't and I'm glad I chose not to. Whatever your reason for smokin is, whatever reason you think you should. There's more reasons why you're stronger than that and don't need to smoke. 

Take care all.

2 days, 2 hours, 48 min in - Cold Turkey

Feel like I’m in and out of going out of my mind right now. I have smoked for 20 years, tried to quit many times with patches and this is the first time I have ever quit cold turkey. I feel so tempted to get some form of nicotine replacement but at the same time I know I’ll just get hooked on something else and just prolong the process of being done with nicotine for good. Plus, the buzz of patches was kind of nice but I still wanted a cigarette. My stepmom “quit” over 10 years ago and still needs the lozenges. I don’t want this for myself or for you guys. Having tried to quit so many times in my life I feel like saying just do it once and get the nicotine out of you for good. Nicotine supplements may make the cravings a little better in the beginning, but all they do is prolong the process and keep you dependent on them or go back to smoking. Good luck all!

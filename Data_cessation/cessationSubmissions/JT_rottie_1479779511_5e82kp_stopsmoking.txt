For the first time in years I walked up stairs and wasn't winded.

I've been smoking for 7 years. I started the patch (level 2) last Monday.

Quitting smoking was a known future, I didnt want our future children to grow up around a parent smoking but we don't know it would be starting this soon.

Well, the elevator wasn't working so a co-worker and I took the stairs ... Wouldn't you know it I talked the entire way up 2 flights and wasn't even out of breathe!

As weird as it is to type out, I'm looking forward to everyday with less nicotine until I'm done.

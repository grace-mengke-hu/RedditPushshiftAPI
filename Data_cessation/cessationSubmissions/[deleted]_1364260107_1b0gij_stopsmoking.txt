I want my boyfriend to quit smoking, how to be supportive?

I love my new boyfriend of 2 months, but I don't like the fact that he smokes. He hid it from me for a while, then right before we got together he told me he smoked but that he was "trying to quit." Since then I mostly have been hearing excuses from him. He will have maybe 4 cigarettes a day (that I can count, it might be more when I'm not around). The excuses he has given me are, "I need to order more stuff for my electronic cigarette," "I got the stuff for my electronic cigarette but I like natural ones better," "I only smoke when I drink," etc. etc. He knows I don't like smoking. I have been kind of mean on purpose about it, but I don't think it's the best approach. I really want him to actually quit, not "try" to quit and then beat around the bush with me. I don't know what to do.

TL/DR: Boyfriend smokes, I don't like it, he gives me excuses, I want him to quit completely. Don't know what to do.

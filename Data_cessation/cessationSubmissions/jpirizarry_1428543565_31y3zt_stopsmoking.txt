30+ HRs in and I feel like I'm high on drugs. Is that normal?

I'm 36 and I've been smoking more than a pack a day (25-30) for more than 17 years. For the last month or so, I've been reading Allen Carr's Easyway in preparation to quit cold turkey. Yesterday I had what I hope to be my last cigarette around midday. I've been fighting cravings ever since. They haven't been nearly as tough as I thought they were going to be, except that I have felt a little bit dizzy a couple of times during the day. But now that I have pass the 30 hour mark, I'm starting to feel a little bit euphoric, like all my sense are heighten. I feel that I can listen to music with more detail, and enjoy it more. I also feel I can smell a lot better than before, and I'm having this weird energy, like if I wanted to go out all night. I'm also feeling dizzy. It feels like I was high on weed or something like that. Is this normal? Have you guys experience something like it while quitting? I guess it's just temporary or psychosomatic, but now I have to go to my girlfriend's apartment (the reason why I'm quitting), and I don't want to seem strange or act weird in any way.

Anyone else get a horrible cough/tons of phlegm, when stopping smoking?

Any time I haven't smoked for 12+ hours, I start coughing horribly and my lungs get full of phlegm. It's pretty horrible. I spoke to the doctor about it, and he seemed to think I was full of shit - since you'd think that stopping smoking would make me breathe better, not worse. But I've gone through the same thing over and over and always with the same result.

I did "quit" smoking one time before and got through this, after like a week it got better. Then I started smoking again (dumb me), and I'm stuck in the same situation. It's kind of difficult because I can't be coughing and sounding like death at work. But I don't have 5 days off in a row where I can deal with all the fallout without anyone noticing. 

Anyone else dealt with this?

I am one month free. I ain’t goin back

Smoking for 8 years. Quit last month. Used a juul to help me. I’ve never made it this far before. It gets easier day by day. Cigarettes actually smell different to me now, they smell, dare I say, disgusting.. I am embarrassed I smelled like that for all these years. 

Wouldn’t be possible if my smoking friends didn’t know I was trying to quit either. But most importantly it comes down to will power. Do I have want something else to have control over me? Fuck no

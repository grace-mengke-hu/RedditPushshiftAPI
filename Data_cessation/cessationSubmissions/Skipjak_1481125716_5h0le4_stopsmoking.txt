This is not as hard as I thought!

Hi, r/Stopsmoking, just wanted to check in.
Today is day 11. Honestly, I can't believe I made it this far. I was a real chainsmoker, and have little backbone/willpower (or at least that's what I thought up untill now)

I feel like the worst part is over. I get about three craving episodes a day now, but they tend to last no longer than 5 minutes. My mood has also gotten better. I can still be irritable at times, but I don't throw todler tantrums over nothing anymore.

The weekend has been a challenge. I went to a bar and went clubbing afterwards. The club was pretty 'laisez-faire' and people were smoking inside. I was tempted to bum a smoke of my friends, but I didn't. It felt good waking up the day after without my mouth tasting like an ashtray.

Almost made it to the two week mark, looking forward!

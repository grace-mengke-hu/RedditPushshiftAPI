Only enjoyed things cause I could smoke?

Im not having any cravings but lately I’ve been thinking about the things I liked to do (anything from going to a party to dinner with a friend) and I kinda think I only thought I enjoyed those activities because I could smoke. Like there’s this event in my college every year that I love but now if I think about going and not smoking I feel like I wont enjoy attending.

Can anyone relate?

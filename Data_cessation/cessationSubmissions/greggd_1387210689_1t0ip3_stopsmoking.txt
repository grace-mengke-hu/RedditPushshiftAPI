I never thought I'd be able to quit but I stopped two years and two months ago!

I smoked for six years. During those six years I would try to quit smoking, but it did not work so well for me. When I would try to quit I realized it was just to see how long I could go until I smoked another cig. Most of the times I would cave because I couldn't handle my friends smoking around me. One day a kid in our group of friends quit smoking. The difference was he never complained when we were all smoking around him. I asked him how he quit and he said he read a book. The book was called, "Allen Carr's The Easy Way." Not to Long after this conversation I went out and picked up the book. I read the book and after completed I did not have any cravings to start smoking again. I am not sure why this method of quitting was so different for me, but I am thankful that it was. My mom and dad smoke since they were very young. They both read the book a little bit after me and have been smoke-free ever sense.

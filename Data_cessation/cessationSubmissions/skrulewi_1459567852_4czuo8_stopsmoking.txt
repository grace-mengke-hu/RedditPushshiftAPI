Two Years April Fools Quitter Check-In

It's been two years today.

I feel bad that I don't come back more often and post. /r/stopsmoking was instrumental in helping me quit. I made one post every day for the first week and a half, and made heavy use of the 'whyquit' website. 

I just don't think about it anymore, for months at a time. So I don't think to come back here. I quit drinking and drugs 07/22/09, but quitting smoking really feels to me like finishing the task.

One idea that helped me quit for real this time was acknowledging the '3, 3, 3' danger zones: 3 days, 3 weeks, and 3 months. All my failures had been around those times. The 3 day mark, all my desperation is focused on soothing my physical withdrawals. At the 3 week mark, the mental withdrawals ('You aren't really quit, you could have a cigarette, you made it 3 weeks, you could go and quit later now that you know you can do it) took me out. But the sneaky one was at 3 months... I felt I was totally over it, but my mind just would sneak an idea in there... I didn't want to admit that it was still eating at me after 3 months, and it would just sneak in there. 

Staying wary and strong through all 3 'threes' helped me get two years this time.

Happy april fools everyone. Stay quit, it gets easier.

DAE love the smell of someone else smoking?

I am wondering if that will go away!  It doesn't make me want one persay, but if I smell someone else smoking I'm like aaaaahhh that smells nice.  Like memories or something, I don't know.  I just like it.  Does anyone else have this? Will it fade with time?  Worried it might make me crack when I get complacent in my recovery further down the line.

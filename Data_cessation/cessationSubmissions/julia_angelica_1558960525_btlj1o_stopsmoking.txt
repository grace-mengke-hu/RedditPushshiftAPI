Thank you for your posts!

I'm on day 3 and I feel so ill like I am coming down with a cold but I think it's my body detoxing and all the mucus coming off my chest. 
Sometimes I feel down and wonder why I am doing this and then I come on here and read all your posts and feel so inspired! So Thank you all so much!!
Last night I had my 1st "smoking dream" I can laugh about it now, when I woke up and realised it wasn't real and I am still a non smoker I was so happy! ðŸ™‚

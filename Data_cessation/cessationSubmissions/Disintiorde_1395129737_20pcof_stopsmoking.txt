Another reason to quit smoking...

Think of the times when you are in public smoking.  Who knows how many ex-smokers are walking by you.  Some may have quit for 20 years or some that same day, but because you are smoking, you are giving them one more craving that they wouldn't have if you weren't there smoking.

What if somebody was at a really low point and because they saw you, they went out and bought a pack.

Oh no :(

I was just on holiday for 2 weeks and didn’t smoke a single cigarette but the day I got home I went out and bought a pack. Now I’m completely back in the habit of smoking all day. How did this happen? I didn’t have any cravings or withdrawals and didn’t even think about cigarettes the whole time I was gone. In fact I was excited to come home as a non smoker.  Has anyone else done this? What did you do to cope and quit again? Feeling so discouraged.

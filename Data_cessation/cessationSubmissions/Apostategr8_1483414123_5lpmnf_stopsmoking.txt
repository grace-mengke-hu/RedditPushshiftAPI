My husband still smokes

I feel like an asshole everytime i quit then bum a cig off my husband. I made it a whole 24hrs and then bummed a smoke off hubby. A month ago i made it a week before i sneaked a cig from his pack. I know my quitting has to be independent of his, its just hard when they are always around. Any advice would be much appreciated. Good luck to you all. I'm still determined to quit for good!

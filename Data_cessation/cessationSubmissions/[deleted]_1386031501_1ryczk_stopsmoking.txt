My plan to quit.

Well, I tried quitting a few months ago to no success, but I think this time I might have a shot. Right now I'm really sick and under normal circumstances I would just try to quit now, but I'm also a week away from finals. If I can cut down to only a few smokes a day when I really need one, I'll be able to make it through finals. Right after finals are over, I'm traveling to Ohio with my family for a week. They know I smoke but I never do it around them. But anyways, hopefully I'll be able to make it through this time.

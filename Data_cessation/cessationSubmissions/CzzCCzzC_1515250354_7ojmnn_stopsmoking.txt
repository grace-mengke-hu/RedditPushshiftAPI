I actually refused a cigarette... while drunk!

Considering the vast majority of my chainsmoking was done under the influence of alcohol (seriously... that combination is too perfect), I was really proud of myself yesterday when I turned down a cigarette even while drunk. 

Not only that, but I live in Europe, and I was offered a pack of my favorite American cigarettes that I can't find here in Europe - the temptation was strong!!! I was eager to just take one for nostalgia, since it's been so long since I smoked that brand... but reason prevailed in the end, and I declined. 

I'm only 9 days in, but everything became so much easier after the first few days. That's when the physical addiction should end. And it feels like the mental addiction gets easier each day. 

Just wanted to share my own personal milestone with y'all, and reiterate - it's possible, and it gets easier!!

Good time to quit after weed?

Hi so I recently quit weed about 3 weeks ago and the withdrawals are bad but I want to quit smoking cigarettes as well and was wondering wether or not it is too soon ? If I wait another two weeks I wonâ€™t be able to quit till the end of the year due to really stressful work/study and I only get a break in December/January

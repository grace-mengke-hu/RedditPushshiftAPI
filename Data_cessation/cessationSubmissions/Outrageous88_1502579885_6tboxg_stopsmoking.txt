Updating for me - and any lurkers out there who haven't taken the first step yet - and to anyone else who would like to read :)

Today is day 12 with no smoking, 1st day with no NRT. So far so good, I know more difficult times are coming, however I am prepared and ready. 

Some things that have helped me:
- Having a plan and sticking to it
- Noticing when my addict mind is rationalizing 
- Realizing that by prolonging the withdrawal period by using NRT was only making it worse on me (personally) 
- I live with a smoker, who smokes indoors - reminding myself of this helps me feel more powerful, stronger and in control of myself- 
--------------although there have been a few times my addict mind will throw things like "you are still getting second-hand smoke, my home still stinks" I quickly deflect these thoughts and replace them with healthy thoughts! ("I am a non-smoker and I do not do that anymore") 
- this sub has helped me a lot
- I had a silly notion a few hours ago that I would always be struggling in my mind, then laughed at the thought and went about my day
-It will get better, it is getting better, I am better!

Just a little rant to track my progress and to help anyone like me out there. As always, any tips, advice, or your own stories are greatly appreciated and welcomed! Thanks in advance

I got my 6-month badge!

Sure, it won't actually be 6 months until the 20th, but I'm still pretty damn proud and I've taken a liking to my new badge already.  

Just wanted to say thanks to everyone here in /r/stopsmoking.  It's because of you that I can call myself a non-smoker and say with confidence that I'll never smoke again.  

You guys and gals rock!

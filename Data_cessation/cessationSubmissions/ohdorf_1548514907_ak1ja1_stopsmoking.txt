Today is the day.

I’m quitting these awful things. I’ve stopped drinking for over a year now. I’ve become vegan and am eating healthy. What reason is there to keep smoking these awful things? Any tips? I’ve quit before, usually cold turkey but I’ve always started back up due to life stressors. Im also so scared to gain weight. I know I’m the only one who can do this but was wondering what you guys use to stay on track? My ideas so far:

Keep some baby carrots on hand to help with the oral fixation/weight gain.

Write in my journal right now all the reasons I want to quit so I can look at it when I’m having a craving.

Write the number of days I’ve gone without smoking to remind myself when having a craving. 

Day by day - tell myself I’m not smoking today. I can smoke tomorrow if I really want but not today. 

What has worked for you guys? Any ideas or things you guys would suggest?

Thank you so much!

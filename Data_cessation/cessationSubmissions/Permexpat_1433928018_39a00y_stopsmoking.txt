2nd time quitting, much tougher than the first...

A little history, I was a long time heavy smoker from age 16-31, in 1998 I had a great job, new lake house and was getting paid fairly well but couldn't afford a boat unless I stopped my 2 pack a day habit, so the wife at the time agreed that if I quit smoking I could buy that boat...so I quit using the patch Jan 1st, 1999...didn't touch a smoke again until 2008 when I got divorced, lost the house, boat etc. and made a drastic change and moved overseas (from US) to Dubai, the day I landed I realized everyone smoked there and before I knew it I had picked up the habit again and have been a 2 pack a day smoker for 7 years again.  

Fast forward to today, about 6 months ago I met a great new girl who is a non-smoker and non-drinker, despite these obvious character flaws (J/K) I am as happy as I have ever been so for both of our sake I've decided to quit this nasty habit once again, today is the 2nd day and I am struggling but determined to do it again. This time seems much tougher though. I am not happy in my current position and the stress of the job is getting to me on the 2nd day, before today my only release from the stress during the day was to run out for a smoke every hour, now I am sitting here with a pounding headache and what feels like the verge of an anxiety attack, this itchy feeling all over and a damn fly buzzing around my desk that I would kill dead if my reflexes weren't so fucked up from my nervous shaking hands...phew, had to get that off my chest...  

Anyhow, I am determined to do this, I just needed a little keyboard therapy...and it seems to have helped a bit for now...thanks for listening!  

Day2, woohoo...day 3 will be a little easier if I remember correctly

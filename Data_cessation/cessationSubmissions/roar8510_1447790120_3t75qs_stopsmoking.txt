Sudden craving -- what to do?

Hi, 
I have been smoke-free for over 102 hours. I have been been keeping track with a phone app.
Now, the app also tells me that I have not smoked ~32 cigarettes in those 102 hours. But the junkie part of my brain is telling me "Oh look, you didn't smoke 32 cigs. Surely you can celebrate with one".

What should I do kill this voice in my head?

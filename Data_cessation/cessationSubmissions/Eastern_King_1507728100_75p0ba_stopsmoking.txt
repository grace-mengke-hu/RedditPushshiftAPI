I feel like I'm slipping

I quit 11th of August, while I was traveling around the States, I am from The Netherlands. I started reading Allen Carr's book to quit smoking and it worked. During my travels I never slipped and never even had the urge to smoke once I had quit.  

But I've been home for a month now and I screwed up three times. 1st of October, My birthday party. 3rd of October, got offered by a friend who knew I had smoked on my birthday. Last Saturday, after a party I got home a little drunk and my dad's cigarettes were out on the table so I grabbed one. 

I have a big deadline for school on Monday and I feel so stressed out because I also have to work a lot. Which is at a gas station, so I basically stand in front of a wall of cigarettes my whole shift. I don't want to pick up smoking again, but I feel that my mind is slipping towards it.

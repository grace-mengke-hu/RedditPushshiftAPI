Day 6, something I realized

So I'm on day 6 of quitting cold turkey and I realize that, for me at least, it wasn't so much that cigs were making me relax but it was that I must've psychologically associated relaxing things with smoking.  For example, I get cravings the most after I've eaten, after sex/masturbation, on break and between rounds of playing games (such as overwatch). These times are de-stress times and they would be de-stressing times with or without cigarettes. Makes sense because i got addicted when I started smoking at an old job because all my co-workers smoked during the break.

So when I'm able to re-wire my brain to not associate smoking with relaxation then I will be at a much better place.

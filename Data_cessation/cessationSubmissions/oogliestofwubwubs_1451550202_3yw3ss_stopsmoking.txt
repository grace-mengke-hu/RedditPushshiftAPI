I am really proud of myself

I'm almost to 8 months. I've quit before, but this is by far the longest I've not smoked.

It was my New Year's resolution last year, and it took until May for me to really do it, but once I did it took.  

Yes, I've gained weight but I look better, smell better and am healthier.  

Best of all, I have self confidence that I haven't had before because I kicked a really hard habit to kick.

I (accidentally) quit last Monday.

So I was really sick last week, like not even able to get out of bed level sick, and I didn't smoke. I've been better for a few days, but I just haven't bought a pack. I'm gonna keep on going with this guys. This is the longest I haven't smoked since I started, even though it feels almost like cheating.

Both my bf and I have tried to quit before, but it never works because one of us starts smoking/we're not open with each other about cravings and difficulties. We both haven't smoked since last week and have been super honest about how hard it has been for both of us. It really helps to have that kind of support this time.

So yea, here's to quitting and to all of you! Thank you for all of your inspirational posts that give me a reason not to go buy a pack at four in the morning!

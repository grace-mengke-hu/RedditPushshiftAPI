Don't get discouraged by temporary failure you only need to succeed once. Going strong at over 1 month!!

I failed so many times. 
From January to June I stayed consistent with the idea that I had to quit.
Everyday I would wake up with the thought that I wouldn't smoke. As you might imagine I smoked most days,it was hard.
At night I would go in my bathroom see myself in the mirror and tell myself  'see,same as yesterday,you love those cigarettes so much but all they do is kill you'. 
Eventually after 6 months of bullying myself into quitting I did it.
I'm on day 33 and I'm not smoking ever again.
I've been stressed, I got drunk I passed almost all my biggest triggers.

This community helped a lot along the way.

I smoked for 8 years,precisely 15-23. 

I wish all the world would stop smoking.
I wish my dad would stop smoking but I guess we only have control over ourselves and the energy we put out. 
I hope my posts motivates you to stop and stay consistent. 
It gets better and It becomes so easy just do it.

Good luck

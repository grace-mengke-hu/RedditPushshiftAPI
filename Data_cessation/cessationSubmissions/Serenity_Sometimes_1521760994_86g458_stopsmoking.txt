Why can't I just stay quit!

I have quit smoking so many times in the last 10yrs; first time was for 5yrs (cold turkey) then 10months (patches), 9months (patches) etc but I keep convincing myself, 'I can have one'. I fall for it every time.

I had a smoking relapse at Christmas and am still puffing away. I want to stop so bad this time. I can't stand the fact that I feel poisoned every time I light up but I still keep doing it. I was an opiate addict for many years (2.5yrs clean and sober) and honestly I find stopping smoking more difficult.

At the moment I'm watching stopping smoking YouTube videos, reading the 'never take another puff' website and got my Allen Carr DVD. I'm going to try cold turkey method again so I'm really grateful to have found this community.

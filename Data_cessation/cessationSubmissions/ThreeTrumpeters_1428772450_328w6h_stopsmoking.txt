Day 58.

I posted here the first day I quit smoking. I had been a pack a day smoker for about a year and a half and quit cold turkey. Today I was sitting with a few of my other friends, which usually wouldn't bother me since I sit with a lot of people who smoke outside at work. The only thing I could think about was smoking but then I just remembered how bad I felt and didn't but ever since, I've been craving them for some reason. Does anyone else experience strong cravings like this this late after quitting??

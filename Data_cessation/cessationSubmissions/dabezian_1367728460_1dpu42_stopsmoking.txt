Back home from college, time for change.

I "quit" for about 3 months before I left for college, but with the availability of cigs on campus, I was wrecked. Swapped to an e-cig for a few months around Christmas, but started smoking again after spring break. 

Now I can't climb for shit and I can't run. Time to end this. Nicotine is ruining me and for nothing. My angsty days are over, I don't need a crutch anymore.

Tonight is the night!

Hello all! I've stumbled upon this community, and I've decided to quit, but after finding this subreddit I feel more motivated that I can succeed. 
I'm sorry if this becomes a huge wall of text, but I've been thinking about this for a while and I need to say a lot. 
I'm 20 years old. I started "socially" smoking in high school around the middle or end of my Jr. year. I had just moved and I used it to help with my anxiety, and it seemed like a good outlet to make friends. That was 2014, and here we are. Now I don't hide behind the veil of being a social smoker, I just smoke, and I'm not proud of it. 
The biggest irony (that I'm not blind to) is that I'm a huge hypochondriac. Every little thing I feel wrong with me my first thought is I need to see a doctor. I smoked American Spirits with my friends. Yes, I was that kid. 
They seemed better at the time, since they didn't have additives but now I'm hooked and I need to quit. My addiction has never been super bad, I would say I usually on the days I have a pack, smoke between one and six cigarettes. That doesn't sound like a lot, but it's enough that I feel the pull of the leash after a day or two. 
I've his this from my family and my girlfriend for a while, something I'm ashamed of. I want to quit for them, so I can be healthy. I want to get in shape, and I want to be around a long time to love this woman I have with me. 
The biggest obstacles in my quitting future I can see, is I have friends who smoke a lot. Much more than 6. 
As a community could you give me advice to help me? 
What's the best way to resist the cravings? 
How can I resist if I'm around friends who are smoking? 
What are coping mechanisms that have helped you all? 
And are there supplements or remedies to help not feel the urge so much?

I appreciate anyone who reads, and I wish everyone else luck in their fight! 
Thank you!!

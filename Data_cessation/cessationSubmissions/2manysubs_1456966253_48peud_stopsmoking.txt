3 weeks! And what I'm noticing

I'm at the 3 week point. The things I'm noticing, mainly, are that cravings fluctuate. Some days I just sort of want a cigarette, other days I feel like I'll explode without one. I thought it would get easier each day, but it wobbles back and forth.

Personally, it's almost more dangerous when I just sort of want a cigarette. Cravings remind me that I'm addicted, make me want to stop. Just wanting a cigarette makes me feel like it's fine, because clearly an addict would need it much more.

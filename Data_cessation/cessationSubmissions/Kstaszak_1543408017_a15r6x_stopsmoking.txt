Day 9

I have been having a pretty easy time so far since my lapse on day 4,  I am hoping something clicked since then,  I am able to get myself out of any craving just fine with normal pressures and stresses.  I still get the urge about 6 or 7 times a day which seems excessive, but the strength of each is diminishing.  Thank u guys for being here and all the kind words of encouragement, it helps.  And also thanks for sharing it stories of successes and failures,  that has made me feel both proud and optimistic about how far I have come and how far I have yet to go....  I think this journey so far has been the most humbling experience overall, because at any moment I can go back to where I was when I started, which is a place I really dont want to be.

My main issue today is, not being able to sleep.... I woke up at 5am and have been tossing and turning since.... not because I want a cigarette... but just because I feel I cant sleep anymore... I will need a nap later because I have to work 3rd shift tonight, and I also have class today...I also need to get the laundry done. Make sure I take my pills, do some dusting,  I really should get the Christmas stuff up...... so maybe I'm just stressing myself out.... this is where I would have a cigarette to calm the chatter in my brain.... I still havent found something to take its place... I dont want a cigarette, so I wont have one,  but how do u stop thinking enough to fall back to sleep?... I am secretly hoping that just writing this out will afford me enough peace to fall back to sleep... we will see.

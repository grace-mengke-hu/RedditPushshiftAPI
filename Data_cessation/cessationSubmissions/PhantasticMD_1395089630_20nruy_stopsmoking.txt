4 weeks down, but today has been the hardest

First of all, I think this has been the longest I've ever gone without smoking since I started. I used Allen Carr's book and found it extremely helpful. After I smoked my last cigarette, after taking deep inhales of smoke and truly feeling it in my lungs, I felt nauseous for a good 20 minutes afterwards. Since stopping, I really haven't had much of an urge to start again. Usually when it comes, it's small enough that I can remind myself of those moments after my last cigarette where I felt like my insides were twisting about that it passes quite easily. I've even gone out and had a lot to drink without having the urge to smoke, which for me is HUGE. I used to have like 2 drinks and be out the door for a smoke.

But today is a different story. I don't know what it is about today, but I keep feeling the strong urge to go to the convenience store half a block away and buy a pack, have a few smokes, throw it out, and start quitting all over again. But I know that's not how it works. Soon enough I'd be back to my old habits. Maybe it's the boredom of having a lighter work schedule recently. Maybe it's the fact that I've recently started studying for an important exam and today wasn't exactly my best day of studying. Whatever it is, it's a shame that on a day that I should have felt proud and strong, I ended up feeling anxious and agitated. 

I will admit that typing this all out has helped some. Maybe just enough to get through the rest of the day. If I can get through this day, I can get through the next tough day.

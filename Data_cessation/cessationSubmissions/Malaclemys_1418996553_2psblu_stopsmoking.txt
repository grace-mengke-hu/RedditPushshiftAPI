I didn't expect this.

Nothing...

It's been a bit more than two days since I quit smoking and I feel fine. I am a little distracted and maybe a little confused even, but it's just like having one beer. I basically feel tipsy. It is a bit annoying, since it's been going on for two days, but otherwise - I'm fine.

Have any of you ever felt like this when you quit? For the record, this is my second time quitting. The first time I felt really "ill" for two or three days after I stopped smoking, so I was expecting the same.

Now I just need to ignore those damn cravings all the time...

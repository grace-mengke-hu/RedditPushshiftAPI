Quitting tomorrow need advice

Hello all after a few years smoking I switched to vaping about two years ago. I've tried weaning myself off it but it never works so I set tomorrow as my date for quitting nicotine cold turkey. I'm just wondering if anyone has any advice or tips to make it through the first few days and try keep willpower in check, thanks in advance

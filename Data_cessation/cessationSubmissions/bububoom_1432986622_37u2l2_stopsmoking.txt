100 days! Obligatory rant

Its been actually more than 100 days now! I am quite happy. Have been a smoker for like 8 years and it was my thing to get in the mood, think, collect myself so I really feared of quitting it.

I liked it. I just didn't like the idea of hurting myself, often feeling out of energy when smoked too much and that feeling of having an addiction. You know that feeling when you're going somewhere and think about how you will be able to smoke there or how many cigs are left in your pocket. Do you have enough in cash in order to buy some?

Despite those things I really liked it, did it everywhere, everytime, when happy, when sad, when challenged a problem but one day just knew its gonna end.

So now its around 3.5 months clean. I can tell what helped:
1) not thinking I can fail. When I though "what would it feel to have one" only after a few days I immediately retreaded with idea that I will feel absolutely horrible because I will ruin my progress.

2) having an interesting job and hobbies helped for me as I immersed in them even more just so I would not have time to think about my addiciton.

3) giving up on friends. Kinda sad, but most of my friends smoke and for this whole time I speaked very rarely to them because I know there will be triggers. I started to fix this issue a few weeks ago and whats strange I dont really want to smoke once I see them smoking.

It was just a rant. I was waiting for my 100 day achievement so I could stop thinking about it and calculating the days, I believe I can now let it go

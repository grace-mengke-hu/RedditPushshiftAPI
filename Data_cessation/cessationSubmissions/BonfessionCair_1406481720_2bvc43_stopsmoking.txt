This seems like the thousandth time I've tried to quit, but I invariably just walk back into the store...

So I finally went and bought one of the eGo-T vapes. I didn't even realize until I actually got there that you could get vapes without any nicotine at all, so I decided to get one of those. I'm hoping that having this thing to "smoke" whenever I want will keep me distracted enough to not go buy another cigar or cigarettes. Anybody have experience with these things? Did it help?

Things to keep busy?

So everyone (or almost everyone) says that when you stop smoking you become amazed with how much time you have. Now I’m on day 5 of Champix (side note: no major side effects so far; only a mild headache and tiredness) and it’s making me cut back which is great, however, I’m noticing at times when I would usually smoke I don’t have an urge to smoke and I have no idea what to do with myself. 

I’m hoping this makes some sense; for example I just turned the oven on to warm up and usually I would go have a cigarette before putting dinner in and tonight I just sorta..... stood there..... I wasn’t sure what to do with myself. I’ve heard of “10 star jumps” or cleaning  but what did you guys do with that extra time?  Thanks! 

Side note: send encouragement I know that my quit date is the best thing I am going to do for myself in my life but that doesn’t stop the “little monster” from running his mouth all day (he’s a jerk).

Getting one cigarette from someone else.

I have relapsed from smoking after about 1 month (prior 1 year of smoking). I made a deal with myself that I could buy a pack of 5 cigars every weekend for going out. This made me slip combined with the stress for upcoming exams. I will be quitting again next week sunday (17th). Learning from last time I will never buy any form of tabacco again, however I am still thinking of allowing myself to ask for a cigarette on special events. Has anybody got experience with this tactic or is this a just very bad idea?

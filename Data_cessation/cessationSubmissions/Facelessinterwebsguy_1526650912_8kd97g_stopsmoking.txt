Thinking about trying to quit vaping

So, here's my short story. I started smoking at 15 and quit at 28. I picked up vaping as a means to quit smoking and never intended it to be a permanent solution. But 2 and a half years later I'm still vaping. 

I started at a 12mg nic content and now I'm at 1.8mg. (I make my own juice so I can greatly control how much nic I put in) 

Over the past 6 months I have been working on myself. I wanted to cut out all my addictions.
Alcohol was difficult (alcoholic for 8 years),
Non prescribed drugs wasn't too bad ( about 3 years of using narcotics),
Prescribed Ativan was hell (1 and a half years),
The only thing left for me to kick is this e-smoke and I will be a free man! 

I've come so far and feel amazing about my present and my future. 

I'm just looking for some encouragement, stories about your experiences on quitting the vape, or anything that will motivate me to keep going. 

Thanks in advance!

Some quitters are jerks.

SO. I am on day 6, and it hasn't been easy, but I know I'm doing well. My new crutch has suddenly become tea. Well, I ran out of tea this morning and walked down to a tea shop to get some more. I started talking to the staff about quitting smoking, and detox teas, and all that and this one little jerk is one of those jerks that lets me know that I will have cravings FOREVER.

I get that. I do. But these are the people that keep some smokers from quitting, because they make it scary; they make it seem like the rest of your life is HARD and SHITTY because you'll never get through "Quitting". As in, you're never quit, you're always quitting.

These people are jerks. And if you are one of these jerks, please stop telling people that it's hard forever!

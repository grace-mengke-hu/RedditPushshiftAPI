Why shouldn't I relapse?

Because I am too strong to smoke again.
Because, eventually, I don't want the responsibility of my own untimely death. 
Because I am buying lovely gifts for me with money that would be spent on cigarettes.
Because I will probably be around to see my grandchildren - and if I don't, at least it wouldn't be my fault.

27 days clean after 10 years of heavy smoking.

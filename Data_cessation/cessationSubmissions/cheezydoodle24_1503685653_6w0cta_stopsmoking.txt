Thank you!!

I just wanted to say thank you for this safe place to help quit smoking. This is my umpteenth attempt to quit smoking. I have had success in the past, but anxiety/fear are my major triggers.  I am at work and its been really hard for me as I am contemplating looking for a new job. I'm just not happy here. Today is day three of my quit and I was so close to just giving up. I thought about going outside, having a cigarette and throwing in the towel. Instead, I hopped on here and read how others are dealing with quitting. All of the stories and comments on here is what helped me get through this really tough craving. THANK YOU!!

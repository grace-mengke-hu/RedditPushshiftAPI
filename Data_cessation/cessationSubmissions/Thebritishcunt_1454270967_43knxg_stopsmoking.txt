Quitting tomorrow

Hello everyone, 

Firstly I have been lurking around the subreddit for a while now and I am sure that many of you could advice me on how to go about quitting. 

Since the last 5 months I have been smoking almost 15 cigarettes a day. However in the last two months it's been a pack a day. I would like to quit because it's getting to much for me now, it's gonna kill me slowly obviously but together with that it takes my money as well. 

What would your advice be on successfully quiting (I have downloaded the stop smoking app too). 

Thanks for your support guys I  really appreciate it. 

UPDATE : Hello! Yes it's been 4 days. Since then I have had around 6 huge cravings, I kept myself busy and it might be wrong but I have had alot of food since the last four days, but I'm decreasing my food intake slowly now. Good luck!!

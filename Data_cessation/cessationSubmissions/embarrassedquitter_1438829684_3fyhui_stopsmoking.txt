I messed up and I need a buddy. Does anyone want a buddy?

I just had a cigarette and I'm so pissed at myself.  I was doing well.  If anyone read my previous post, I live in a pretty stressful situation and therefore so is my husband.  Last night he told me he couldn't take the additional stress of me quitting and being so grumpy and low energy and he got really mad, at me and also at the baby and it was just...shitty.  I feel like I can't talk to him anymore and I need someone to talk to, to keep me accountable.  I don't want to go back to doing this.  

Tonight I let it all get to me.  I'm not putting any blame on him, I know I have no excuse and it was my doing and I feel like a fuck-up.  But I want to start again.  Does anyone here want a buddy?

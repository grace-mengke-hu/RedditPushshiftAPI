Still fighting the good fight! I took another step on the road away from addiction this week.

After 18 years of smoking, about 3-1/2 years ago I lit my last cigarette and haven't had a single one since. But that's not the whole story. As many of us do, I turned to other things for my "fix". 

First, I went to nicotine lozenges, and they were a great help. I couldn't have done it without them. Kept the cravings minimal, and they satisfied the oral fixation. 

After a while, I knew I had to get off the nicotine, but I wasn't quite ready to give up the oral fixation so I started keeping mints on me. I went through a lot of mints, and then I found [forevermints](https://4evermints.com/), which were also a big help. They're expensive as hell, but they really do last a long time and they really helped ease my cravings. 

And finally, there was food. As so many of us have, I turned to food when the cravings hit, and I've gained about 20 pounds since quitting, and I'm getting tired of it, to be honest.

So on Monday morning, I (finally!!) quit the mints and went on a 3-day, water fast. I had many moments when I wanted to reach into my pocket for that tin of mints, and the hunger pangs were pretty intense at times, but last night, I finished the fast and haven't had a mint since either. I'm so happy with myself right now, and I absolutely feel great!  

Fuck addiction in all its forms. Keep fighting, people! 

Edit: to everyone who thinks that this is a cautionary tale against lozenges (or mints), that's not how I see it at all. I smoked for 18 years, developing all those brain patterns, and I (so far) have successfully replaced those patterns with new ones. Three+ years after 18 to do so really doesn't seem excessive to me.

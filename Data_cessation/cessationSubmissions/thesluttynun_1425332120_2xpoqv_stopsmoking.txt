3rd day in and this is rough

Holy shit, the cravings are pretty bad but I was able to make it through it and i'm home now. I hear the first 3 days are the worst and then after that it gets better but its damn hard. I really really don't want to have to reset my badge and that is my main motivation. I think that I can do it, its probably just going to be one of the hardest things i've ever done. Thanks, I just really needed to vent.

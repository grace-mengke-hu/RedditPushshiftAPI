8 days cigarrette free and do need help!

I quitted 8 days ago but today I feel I´ll relapse! I went to an app I downloaded to help me quit and it sent me here , so here I am! 
First of all, I want to apologise for my English. I am Spanish and English is my second language, so although I can manage, my words may sound quite odd.
Let´s do it. 8 days nicotine free and I´ve felt quite well! I´ve been feeling very anxious for these two last days, but I´ve manage to go trough it!But today it feels different. Due to my job I´m preparing a hard, long exam that I´ll take in June and I have to struggle a lot to study it all. I´m just feeling I cant do so without a cigar, I´m getting stressed because I cant concentrate, think or do anything related to studying.
Really, I´m thinking of smoking again, prepare my exam, take it, and once all this s**** has finished retake my quitting despite all the efforts made during this hard week.

Need help and support! Thanks!

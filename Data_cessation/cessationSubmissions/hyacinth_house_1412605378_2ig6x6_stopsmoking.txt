In need of motivation to quit.

The post with the cancerous lung cells made me cringe at smoking for the first time in a very long time. I need more photos and information about what smoking is doing to my body. I find knowing what happens on a cellular level medically helps me not enjoy cigarettes. What helped you actually want to quit? I'm 12 years in, started at 14, and I don't want it to be 20 years later and still be smoking.

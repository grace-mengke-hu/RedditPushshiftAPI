Has this happened to anyone?

I recently just stopped smoking cigs 2 weeks ago. For years even in high school (about 9 years ago) I have always smoked marijuana  before I even smoked cigarettes and now recently since I quite the cigs I thought me smoking weed wouldnâ€™t be affected but it gives me anxiety every time I smoke now. My heart starts to race and I get all panicked. I try to calm myself down and tell myself that Iâ€™ve been doing this for years and now why all of a sudden is this happening to me? Marijuana has always been my stress reliever (besides a cigarette) but now since I donâ€™t want to smoke cigarettes I just want to continue using marijuana. I wanted to know if this has happened to anyone else or what could possibly be the cause of thisðŸ˜©

Day 4: My inability to poop is more frustrating and distracting than the cravings.

My body is so used to the morning coffee and cigarette then poop routine that I’ve been backed up for... well, 4 days.

Currently drinking a “smooth move” tea to hopefully overcome this. This is the worst unexpected side effect so far (and really, in the grand scheme, it’s not that bad).

Holy Crap.. 1 year!

Honestly, I have no idea how I was able to pull this off. I still remember the exact moment I decided to quit but I had no idea I could actually pull it off for a WHOLE YEAR!
Thanks /r/StopSmoking you were all a huge inspiration for me to begin this journey.
Also, I know these things are pretty hokey, but the app CessationNation was a massive help for me personally and if anybody is looking to take that step and quit for good - to have something at hand, all the time, reminding you of your progress, is an incredible resource. 
Best of luck to those just starting out and to those who are 1, 2, 5, 10 years in. It's a daily grind, but we're all better for it!

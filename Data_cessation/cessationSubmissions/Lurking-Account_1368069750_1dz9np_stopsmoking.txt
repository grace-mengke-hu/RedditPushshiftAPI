Quitting in a house full of smokers. Help!

I've been smoking for about 3-4 years now and I live with my brother and parents. They all smoke and it's been over a year since i was diagnosed with Crohn's Disease, and smoking can cause flare ups. Obviously there are other reasons to stop such as me being very unfit and I've realised it really doesn't suite me. Cigarettes are always left around the house and i've asked everyone to hide them from me and deny giving me one when I ask for one but they just end up slacking. I've stopped buying my own but i just end up sharing everyone else's. Moving out isn't an option and getting them to quit would be getting blood from a stone. I've tried electronic cigarettes and just plain willpower but I've never really gone past a week without relapsing. There's no easy option, as ever, but i'm open to suggestions as I'm running out of ideas!

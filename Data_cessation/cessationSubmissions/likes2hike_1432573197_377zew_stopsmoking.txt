When do you stop being mean?

I need to quit nicotine but I am afraid of the strain it may put on my relationships. I haven't smoked for about a year but I am still very much addicted to nicotine. I wear a patch and occasionally (more recently) use an e-cig as a back up. I know that I can get really mean when I try to get off it. How long before you don't feel like choking everyone around you?

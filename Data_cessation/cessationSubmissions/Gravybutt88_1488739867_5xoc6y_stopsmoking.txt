Going to quit soon - cream of tartar?

So im quitting smoking this week. I need to do it. Haven't mentally decided on a day yet but ive been a 2 pack a day for about 15 years. Nows the time I feel. 

Someone told me about a 1/2 tsp of cream of tartar in an 8 oz glass of oj at night to detox. Anyone ever heard of it or have any results from doing it? I want to do it cold turkey so in concept this should help. I read a few horror stories about it people doing similar. Is it safe?

Sorry if this is a vague post, ive got a nasty ear infection right now so im a bit off. If anyone has any good cold turkey tips that would help id greatly appreciate it! Thanks!!

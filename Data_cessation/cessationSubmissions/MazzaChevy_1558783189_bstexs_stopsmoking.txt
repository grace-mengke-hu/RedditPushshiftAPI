I need to do it for my daughter

I'm sitting here on my birthday sobbing because my wonderful beautiful 10 year old daughter is still begging me to stop. She is crying herself to sleep right now.  She's old enough now to watch the TV ads and be aware that it could kill me. She can't understand why I keep doing it. Neither do I. I stopped when I was pregnant and started again when she was 4 months old. I stopped for a whole year! What the duck is wrong with me? I hate patches and gum, and have no intention of vaping. I need to go cold turkey. I've done it before, I should be able to do it again. Are the quit smoking apps any good? How do I cope with all my triggers? I'd love some good advice please.

5 months smoke free, yet I sit here with cravings pulling at every inch of my body...

I need to keep this real with myself. I quit because I was having issues breathing. After 5 years I knew what choice I had to make, and it was surprisingly easy (with the help of e-Cigs). I don't remember one craving these last past 5 months. No excuses, or rationalizations. No fond memories or envy when watching someone else smoke.

Yet, here I am. Sitting alone, feeling my body ache for just one hit. I don't even remember what a hit feels like, but I know that it feels good. My body knows that with just one hit, this shaking will subside. My mind will calm, these nerves will steady. That's the rationalization talking. You are witnessing a drug addict teetering on the edge of relapse. And, that's what I am. That's what we all are, drug addicts. We're addicted to that ride, that amazingly decadent yet sinfully evil ride. Yet, we have to fight against the temptation, and against the cues that trigger these moments. 

I'm not sure what will come of me tonight, whether I slip up and smoke. Or, whether I maintain my composure and keep smoke-free. All I know is that this is one powerful fucking drug.

Oh god. The Angry Hunger is back...(Day 1)

Good Morning /r/StopSmoking,

I used to be here regularly a few years ago, and ya'll helped me quit for what turned into a full year before I fell off the wagon. After two more years of smoking I have finally reached a tipping point in my life where I cannot sustain this habit anymore mentally, emotionally, or financially.

It's only been a few hours, but I feel pretty good so far....except the angry hunger is creeping back in hardcore. Thank god for the Allen Carr book teaching me about the actual effects of nicotine withdrawal. GTFO of here nicotine. We don't need you anymore.

Looking forward to spending some time with you beautiful people  again. People helping people. It's a great thing. :)

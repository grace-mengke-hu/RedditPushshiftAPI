Quitting Smoking is Easy, I've Done it Hundreds of Times

Hello, Folks.

I'm 31 and have been smoking a pack a day pretty consistently for the last ten years. I've tried everything to quit: gum, patches, cold turkey, vaping, Chantix, you name it. The only one that was in any way effective was Chantix; I actually quit for two years after my (ex)wife and I had our second child. I still had the odd craving during that time and picked it up right where I left off five minutes after she told me she wanted out.

That was almost two years ago. I've used Chantix several times since then. It's highly effective for me but I do get moody and can't bring myself to take it as long as you're supposed to. The last time I tried it, around 3 months ago, I was lethargic, depressed, and started spending more time thinking about driving into oncoming traffic than is healthy. I stopped taking it and picked up the smoking again.

It seems like every few months I see the effect smoking has on my bank account, get pissed off, and quit for a couple of weeks. Last night was the same. I found the leftovers of my prescription and thought I'd try one last time. I took a half-dose before bed and the same with breakfast and dinner today. Smoking was on my mind quite a bit today but I've only had one all day, about an hour ago. It was more of a curiosity smoke than anything, the drug kicks in fast for me and smoking tastes awful within 24 hours. I guess I wanted to see if the half-dose was going to be the same. It was. So far no grouchiness, no weird thoughts.

My motivation for quitting is the money. I want to set up a separate bank account that I can use to hold the difference as a motivational tool. The quit-smoking apps and tools all have calculators that will show you how much you're saving, but I want to actually see it. I want to buy a house soon. I want a kickass workshop and quitting means I can have that. Smoking is ridiculous, let it stick this time.

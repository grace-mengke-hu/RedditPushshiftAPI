Ever since I quit smoking, I've been seeing a lot of UFO's when I drive.

Yea... you read it right, since I quit smoking I've been seeing a lot of UFO's out of the corner of my eye when ever I drive to work. Until tonight I just realized it's the little light on my e-cig reflecting off my window. 38 days of wtf.

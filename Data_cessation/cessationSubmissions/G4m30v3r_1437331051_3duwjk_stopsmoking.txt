Exercise plans

So I'm on day 9, go me, and stationary bike an hour a day. I build a little huff puff but nothing major. I also play just dance in workout mode with my daughter (which is a surprisingly intense aerobic or I'm just that out of shape lol) Anyone have an exercise plan they use they would want to share? Prefer something I can do in limited space without weights.  
I was considering p90x but don't want to go all in on something else because if I fail I may fail back on smoking also.
  
What can be done to help the lungs clear out the old crap? I drank this detox tea but it tasted like crap.
  
My wife likes to walk a lot but I really despise walking. Wii fit free run is kinda fun.

TIA

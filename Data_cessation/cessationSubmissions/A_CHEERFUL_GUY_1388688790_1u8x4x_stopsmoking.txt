I don't want this.

Wake up, shower, get dressed, make breakfast, make lunch, leave for work. Smoke.

Stop at gas station, get a coke, get a red bull, get a pack. Smoke.

Driving to work, listening to my morning talk show, laughing to Head up your ass headlines. Smoke.

Get to work 40 minutes early. Smoke. Chain Smoke.

I don't want to quit, I love smoking. I love that burn, it's amazing. Why would I want to quit this?

Because I want to but I don't want to. I want to because of how it will make me feel in the long run, but I don't want to because of how it will make me feel in the short run.

My girlfriend is supportive and my roommate is quitting with me.

I feel like a zombie.

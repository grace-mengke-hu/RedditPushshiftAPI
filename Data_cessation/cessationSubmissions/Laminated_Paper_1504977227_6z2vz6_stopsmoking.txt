Any way to replicate the "Full Lung" feeling.

Hey This is my first time trying to quit and I'm doing fine so far, mainly I think my nicotine cravings are gone but what still remains is the "full lung" craving. So far I've tried holding my breath for a minute to minute and a half (Which helps a bit) and herbal cigarettes (which doesn't help at all, I can barely get any smoke through them.) I'm thinking I might have to vape but I'd rather not have to.

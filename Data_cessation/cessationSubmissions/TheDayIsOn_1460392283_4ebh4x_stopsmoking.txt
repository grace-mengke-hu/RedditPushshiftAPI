6 months and $1,900 later........

I quit on October 11th at noon so I just crossed the 6 month mark a half hour ago.  I'm going to Miami later this week for a long weekend  pretty much covered by the money I didn't use to buy cigarettes over the last 6 months.  I was a pack-plus a day smoker for 28 years. This sub has been a big help so thanks everyone! New quitters you can do it! Stay strong!

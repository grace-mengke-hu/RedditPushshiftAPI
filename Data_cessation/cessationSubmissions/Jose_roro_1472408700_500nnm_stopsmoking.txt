Chest and back pain.... day 20 smoke free

So I was getting this really bad pain in my chest and in my back. Accordding to the internet it could be 
1. Withdrawal symptoms of the nicotine 
2. Stress
3. Angina pectoris
4. Cancer

So I started going crazy, because i thought i was going to die. Last night I thought thst maybe just maybe it could be a muscular pain since latelt i have been carrying some heavy stuff at home, so I tryied a heat patch and slept on it.

I do not have the pain no more!!!! I guess it was muscular and probably some stress lol

Wanted to share just in case someone has a similiar situation, do not disregard the most logic explanations, nicotine can really mess with you mind.

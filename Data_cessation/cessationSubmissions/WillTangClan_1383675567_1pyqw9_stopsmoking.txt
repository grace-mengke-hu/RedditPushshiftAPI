Decided to quit and I need help

I'd like to start off by saying how great it is that this sub exists and I'd love to get your advice. I smoked my first cig about 7 months ago and since then I've been increasing my daily amount until I've become a pack a day smoker for the last 2 months. I guess I started because I felt stressed and depressed, but it's only gotten worse with every puff and I need help quitting. I've tried to quit everyday for the last two weeks and any advice you guys have would be appreciated. Thanks! 

edit: Thanks for all the comments! It means a lot hearing from you all and I feel good about quitting this time!

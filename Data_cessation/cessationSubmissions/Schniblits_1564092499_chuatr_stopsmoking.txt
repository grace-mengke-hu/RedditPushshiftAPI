Psych student studying nicotine dependence and anxiety please help :)

Hello my name is Chris Krueger and I am writing a paper for my research methods class about the effect nicotine dependence has on anxiety levels. I am trying to get smokers and smokers trying to quit to take a quick survey for data collection purposes.

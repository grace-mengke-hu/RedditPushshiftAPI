6 days

Been battling cigarettes for the better part of 7 months. Tried chantex twice. Worked better the first time. now im on the patch and have 6 days no cigarettes despite a close call this morning. Cigarettes are the only vice ive had trouble kicking. Drinking, pain pills, weed. I was able to stop with minimal effort but smoking has been hands down the hardest. Even with my uncle dieing of lung cancer and both my parents being in remission from lung cancer and i STILL want a cigarette. The only reason i quit was to make my wife and parents happy and of course i dont want to go through what my parents did and i dont want my wife to go through what my aunt did.

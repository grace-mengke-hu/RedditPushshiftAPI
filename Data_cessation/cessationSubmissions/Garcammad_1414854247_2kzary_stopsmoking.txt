Last night was the first party night that I didn't even think about a cigarette

I just realized this...and I just realized that I didn't realize it last night. Several hours of hosting a party, entertaining and drinking, I didn't even think about a cigarette. We took a cab to a local bar and at one point I did notice that a girl that sat beside me smelled like cigarette smoke, but I didn't think of how *I* wasn't smoking, if that makes sense. I know it's still early...I'm not going to fool myself and let down my guard, but this is a huge thing!

For all of you just now stopping, this is only day 17 for me. It may seem like hell right now but it gets easier, and faster than you think it will. Hang in there!

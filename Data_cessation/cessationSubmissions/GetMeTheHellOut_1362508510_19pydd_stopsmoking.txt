E-Cigarettes & Canadians Don't Mix, or So They Say

This has probably been noted before, but despite the fact that nicotine-laden e-cig cartridges are banned in Canada, that doesn't mean they're impossible to get. In fact, as long as you order small numbers at regular intervals (I was on about 6 packs of cartridges a month,) it really seems like they get over the border with no issue.

But that's not really why I'm posting here-- I actually quit vaping entirely about two or three months ago. I'm here to relay an interesting experience I had after several months of replacing smoke for vapor.

I couldn't stand cigarettes anymore. The few times I broke down while vaping, I swore I could *taste* the tar on my tongue. It totally ruined real smoke for me (though I certainly have no problem with that!)

I'm not saying that vaping is a method for nicotine sessation, but it's what worked for me.

Does quitting negatively affect your cardio?

I have been a casual smoker for the last 2 years with weeks in between where I will only have 2-3 cigarettes/ week and even was at 1 a week during the summer. During this entire time I have been doing muay thai (training for 4 years). I took a break from the muay thai in early december before my final exams and at the same time went to smoking about 4-5 a day for 2.5 weeks. I quit cold turkey around december 20th but unfortunately have suffered 4 lapses since all coinciding with going out with my friends and drinking. My problem is when i tried to get back into muay thai or even go for a run my stamina was pretty shot. I feel even worse than when i was smoking 4-5 in a week but still going regularly. Is it because i took a break or is the SOB a symptom of quitting? 
Sorry for the long post, any advice would be helpful. Thanks!

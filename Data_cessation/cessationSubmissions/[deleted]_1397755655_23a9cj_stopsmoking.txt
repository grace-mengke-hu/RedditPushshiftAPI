Day 2 - The temptation is so high

I'm at the end of day 2 (my counter isn't working) and it's so tempting to go out and buy a pack. It's continu on my mind and just smoking one cig would seem so good.

Any advice on how to decrease this self-talk / rationalizating? 

I've tried quitting multiple times, have smoked 8-9 years (21 now) and I'm quitting cold  turkey.

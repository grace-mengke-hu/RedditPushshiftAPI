Stupid shit makes me crave anyone wanna talk?

So I'm 19 years old quiting smoking not for me (because I really don't give a shit about how long I live) but I can see it hurts my brother and my friends and it would hurt my parents... Basically just got the I only want to be friends line from a girl I really fucking likes and I'm having a hard time not going to the store and smoking until I'm sick... That being said anyone around to talk or give advice funny story or anything reallyto get my mind off of this fucking craving and stupid shit

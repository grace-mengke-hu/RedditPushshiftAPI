any tips for splitting headaches?

I haven't smoked in two weeks and, while I've been using gum VERY occasionally, I'd prefer to beat the nicotine addiction without weaning myself off. I've been experiencing excruciating headaches every single day. Sometimes it even hurts to move my head or neck. I haven't found anything yet that's effective in beating these headaches (pain medication, caffeine, drinking tons of water etc). Is this normal? Does anyone have any suggestions for beating these headaches?

Would've done it if I had a lighter

3 days without smoking.

I craved one like crazy after dinner tonight, so I went for my stash and put the ciggie in my mouth. I just needed to find a lighter and head downstairs outside the building.

There was one lighter inside the pack but it was out of juice. Could not find any other. After texting a neighbor for a lighter I considered lighting up the ciggie with the gas stove and hussle to the elevator, run through the hall and pretend I just lighted the thing.

But I didn't do it. The ciggie was dangling between my lips as I distracted myself with a book.

That was 2 hours ago. I am going to bed. Cravings are high right now. Cannot focus.

My father whom I met last year keeps on promising he will quit but he doesn't. Then he says he will have one every once in awhile. I want him to quit completely!

He has a 4 year old and a 9 year old daughter, I will never forgive myself if I continue to let him slowly die before them. What can I do? I don't know what to do or even start. I've begged him to stop, he talks about it calmly like its just a leaf in the wind. I also don't want my sisters to contract any breathing problems from second hand smoke

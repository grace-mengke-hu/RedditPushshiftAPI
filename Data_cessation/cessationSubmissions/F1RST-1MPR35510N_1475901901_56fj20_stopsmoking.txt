21,000 cigarettes not smoked

Jesus that is terrifying and seems impossible. At my height of smoking even more. That was just the average. If you smoke a pack a day that is 7,300 cigarettes a year. Ugh. I want to scream at my past self, how fucking intolerable stupid was I. And I did that for years and years. So horrible. So much money and regret.

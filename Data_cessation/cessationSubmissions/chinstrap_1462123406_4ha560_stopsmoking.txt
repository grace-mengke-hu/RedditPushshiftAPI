One year, no cigarettes!

Thanks everyone for all your posts and support. It's hard to believe that, after 30 years of smoking, I managed to do this. It had seemed so impossible! I can't say it has been easy, and I still have to fight with wanting to smoke sometimes, but it truly wasn't as hard as I thought it would be.

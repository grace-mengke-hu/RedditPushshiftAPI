Just got home from the long weekend, and of course it's on my mind.

I was gone all weekend visiting friends in another state. Great time. Completely smoke free, no temptations.

I got home from the airport and my roommates left their cigarettes out while they were gone. I smoked one, and now I am reminded why I wanted to quit in the first place. Just thought I would share. It's not a good experience, even if you are coming off of a great weekend out of town.

3 Years today.

I quite three years ago today as my doctor told me to quit because I wasn't going to make it until my 43rd birthday. It took me 3 months to mentally psych up for it and I turned 43 years old in January. 
 
For those who are just starting... the first 3 to 5 days were incredibly hard and then after that it started getting easier. At 3 years I have urges a couple of times a week but it doesn't control my life. It is more like going to a bakery and smelling all the good food and deciding not to buy something. It is difficult sometimes but very controllable. You do need to keep up your defenses all the time.
 
If you are wondering I smoked 1 and a half packs a day from ages 15 to 30 and over two packs a day from 30 to 40 years old. I loved smoking. I was like Dennis Leary with cigarettes. I was proud of it, didn't ever want to quit and I smiled every time I had a Camel. I needed a death scare to get me to quit and if I can quit... you can quit. 
 
Good luck everyone... I am going to the store to buy me an ice cream cake now for a celebration. It is more important than my real birthday. Just keep on trying!!! Good luck!!

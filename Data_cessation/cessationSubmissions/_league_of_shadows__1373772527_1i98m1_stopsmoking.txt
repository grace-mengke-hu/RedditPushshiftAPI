I'm a 27 year old man and have been smoking a pack a day for 10 years now.

I quit today, and I have gone 22 hours without a smoke for the first time in as long as I can remember. I haven't had a problem with not smoking today, however, I have been constantly thinking about smoking the entire time. I'm assuming tomorrow will be the day I have massive urges and cravings, but I am sticking to my decision and I will make it.

Not sure what I expect from posting here, I have just been lurking this subreddit for so long that I have read enough posts that maybe some encouragement might help as it gets tougher. Wish me luck!

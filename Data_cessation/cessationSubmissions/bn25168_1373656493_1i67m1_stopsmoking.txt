Anyone else quit and experience excessive gas (burping and farting)? Explanation?

I officially quit 3 days ago and so far so good other than the fact I have been burping and farting like a machine. The farts have no detectable smell, are not loud, but they're powerful pressure-wise. And I burp just as much. 

 I tried googling this, and found people who have the same symptoms sometimes for months (fuck!) but no explanations as to why. I have had zero change in my diet, the only difference in my life is my quitting smoking. This is better than smoking but hot damn is it annoying to constantly have gas.

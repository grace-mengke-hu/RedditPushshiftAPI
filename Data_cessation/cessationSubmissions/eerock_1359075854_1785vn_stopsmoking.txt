Almost a year now and I nearly gave in to temptation.

Last weekend I was walking with a friend and I saw a pack of menthols on the ground outside a restaurant.  I gave it a little kick only to realize that the pack was rather clean and heavier than an empty box.  I picked it up and sure enough it was unopened.  I tried asking a few girls we passed if they smoked and they said no; trying to give the pack away but they probably thought it was some lame come-on attempt.  Girls ignored the free smokes opportunity, and I'd had a couple beers already so the temptation was live.  The pack was burning a hole in my pocket.  What probably saved me was the fact that I no longer carried a lighter.

We met up with a friend and I asked him if he wanted them and he took them off my hands.  I felt better after they were out of my possession for good.  What nasty little f**kers cigarettes are!

Oh well, counting down to my one year anniversary and looking forward to it!  Just remember, **not even one** more cigarette is okay.

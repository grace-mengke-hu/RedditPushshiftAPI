I can't quit without nicotine replacement.

Today is day 5 of me not smoking but I feel like I am fooling myself by using nicotine patches. It is the only thing that keeps me sane during my workday. It is not like it makes me stressed or angry, it just makes me restless and unable to sleep. I used to smoke up to 60 a day on my worst with a minimum of at least a pack a day. 

What works best for you guys to battle the restlessness?

15 Days ..Almost Broke today!!

I am 15 days quit today ...first time quitting this horrible 25 year habit !! I was doing so well and feeling so strong and then out of nowhere my dog got sick Friday night and passed away.... I was devastated I didn't even think of smoking Saturday or Sunday I was so sick... but now In dealing with all the grief ...today has been very difficult... many times today I pondered buying a pack and trying to justify it in my mind ..I didn't and couldn't ...Hanging in there but what a rough couple of days :(((

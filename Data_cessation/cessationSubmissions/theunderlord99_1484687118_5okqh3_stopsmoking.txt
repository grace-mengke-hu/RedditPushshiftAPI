Never thought I'd pass a month when I started

And it's already 52 days since I quit, the first 1-2 weeks were hard indeed. After 3-4 weeks the cravings are almost non existent with the occasional craving that lasts for less than five minutes at max.
Been a smoker for the past 5 years at about 20 sticks a day and I have to say I feel great now after not smoking. To the people out there who has just started, keep going!  For the rest who haven't started to quit, why not today? :)

Nicotine gum

Just started using it today. Apparently twice as successful as going cold turkey. I went cold turkey 3 years ago, and remained off the cigs for 2.5 years. Need the nicotine these days though because I have exams and assignments all the way till early June.

I can already see some benefits. Was able to jog 6 kilometres this evening and work out for 45 minutes in the gym. Usually I only jog 2-3 kilometres when I smoke, and I have difficulty the last 15 minutes of my workout in the gym. Often I give up and cut my workouts short. Not anymore!

Are any of you on gum? How's your success been?

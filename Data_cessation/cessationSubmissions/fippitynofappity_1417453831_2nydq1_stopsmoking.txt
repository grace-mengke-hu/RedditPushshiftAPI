Weird, but: I think I accidentally quit yesterday... pack a day smoker for 25 years

So, as you can tell by the username, I recently gave up a different destructive habit... and that has been really great for me, huge improvement in my quality of life and I don't know, perhaps laid the groundwork for what has happened now... he's the story:  the wife quit smoking on Thanksgiving, so I had the kids to watch all weekend.  Friday night I ran out of cigarettes.  I didn't plan this, but I just didn't buy any more.  So now I have not smoked since Friday night, which I'll be the first to admit is pretty weird for me.  I am noticing that it's really not that bad, it's just this sort of persistent low-level irritation that comes and goes, and it seems like as time goes on I can forget about it for longer and longer.  I read the Carr book a while back and now I'm reading it again, one thing in there that I noticed seems true for me is that fear and doubt are the real killers... whenever I start to feel those feelings that's when it is the worst for me... but now I am just like well of course I can do this without smoking, it's just this little thing to not do... I really feel like the psychological aspect is the real killer of smoking addiction... anyway, I just wanted to write this down and get a badge to track my progress... I am a bit afraid to break the spell, but then maybe it's not a spell... Anyone have any advice for me?

Many thanks!

40 hours and counting

Hello all. This is my 2nd serious attempt at quitting smoking. The first time lasted 13 months. Can't really remember why or how I picked it up again. So here I am, after about 37 years of smoking, trying it again. No questions yet, but I expect I'll be back here  when the cravings are really fighting me hard. I have had a couple of doozys, but so far have been able to resist. Wish me luck!!

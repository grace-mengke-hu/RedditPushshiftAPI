One year today!

Today marks a whole year without nicotine! I'd been messing about for a few years beforehand with vaporizers but always went back to cigarettes.

 I decided enough was enough and on the spur of the moment just stopped cold turkey, as I realised all the people I know who have successfully quit have done the same, no patches, gum or anything. 
What surprised me was how much easier it was than I imagined, i just decided not to smoke for that day, and continued that way. 

If I can do it you all can too!

So.. How long does the withdrawal last?

Yo guys 19 y/o male here, I'm on day 8 of stopping smoking. Was smoking for 6 months like 5-10 cigs a day. Around a week ago, I decided to stop cold turkey. First day was not that bad, I started to feel some slight cravings later on in the day. From day 2, the withdrawals started.. I started feeling slightly anxious, mood fluctuations, found it hard to relax at home etc. These withdrawals peaked on days 4-6, but I could definitely feel them coming down day by day. Now, on day 8, I'm just left with some anxiety which is pretty annoying and I just find it quite hard to relax at home and watch a TV show, I don't feel the withdrawals anywhere near as much when I'm out, keeping busy, so I've been going out a lot more, spending more time at the gym etc, to try make the days go as fast as possible. 

Anyway, I'm just wondering by time frame does the withdrawal from nicotine go away? I'm getting really tired of dealing with the withdrawals already and just hearing some advice from people who also experienced this would be really helpful. Thanks for reading :)

This sucks big time

Day 7 (screw you badge, I know what day it is), woke up at 3AM being angry at things. 

This absolutely sucks the big one, and not only am I pissed off at pretty much everything, I honestly get a mix of anger and depression which comes and goes fairly regularly. Pardon my language, but fuck this shit. And can't reddit have a clearer captcha thingy down below? Fer fuck sakes, not everyone is gifted with 400/20 vision.  Ok, rant over.

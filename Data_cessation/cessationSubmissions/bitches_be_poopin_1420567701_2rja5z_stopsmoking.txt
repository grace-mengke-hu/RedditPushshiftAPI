Sick in bed. First day without a cigarette in five years.

I'm getting over bronchitis. I very rarely get sick (dumb luck, I guess) but the past week or so has been gross. I've cut back since I got sick but I've still smoked a few a day. It's obviously not helping. I feel much better than I did a week ago but I'm still hacking up gunk and my chest and back is sore from coughing. And just... just *so* many fluids coming out of my face.

I decided last night that I wasn't going to smoke one at all today and told my SO (also a smoker) this morning that I'd like him to keep me accountable to that. He thought it was a great idea and took the cigarettes to work with him so he I wouldn't be tempted. He's been *so* great while I've been sick. I got home from a shitty day at work yesterday to our ENTIRE house completely cleaned, the dishes done, the laundry washed, folded and put away and I literally burst into tears. He's been bringing me whatever I need and cuddling me while doing a great job of pretending that all of the spit and snot flying around isn't gross at all. He's always looks so sad when I have a coughing fit and hates seeing me in pain. So I decided to give him (and my lungs) a break from cigarettes for a day. 

I've been up for 6 hours. It's been 19 hours since my last cigarette. I'm drinking so much tea and watching Netflix. I've had an oral fixation since early childhood so I'm eating loads of sunflower seeds to keep my stupid mouth busy. 

This fucking sucks.

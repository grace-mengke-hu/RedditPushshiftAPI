Is one mistake betrayal?

Hi, I would like advice from someone with more 'quitting' expirience. I
ve quitted 2 weeks ago, and the reasons are quite different. I am not planning to smoke again, not now when I see the benefits (or better said normal state) of not smoking. My boyfriend has been a great support to me (he has never smoked or had similar 'issues'). Yesterday I've made a mistake and smoked one cigarette, and really I'm not feeling like smoking again, it was just stupid mistake. I've told him about it because I don't like keeping things from him, but he thinks of it as a betrayal, as if I betrayed him and made a fool out of him. I don't know how to cope with it. I feel bad enough bout my mistake. Now I feel like crap because of that too. 

Does anybody have an advice or similar expirience?

2 days smoke free! First time quitter. I'm only 23 I could use some support!

I have only been smoking for about a year. I don't feel any physical effects when I do smoke anymore. I do it mainly to curve my appitite as well as a stress reducer. Something for just me, a moment to myself.

Anyways, I got the stomach flu Sunday and I have not smoked since then. It feels good. Especially because I have been trying to work out more and be more fit and healthy. 

If I try to stop now, what can I expect to happen to my mind and mood in the next few weeks? I have an ecig too, been thinking about using that.

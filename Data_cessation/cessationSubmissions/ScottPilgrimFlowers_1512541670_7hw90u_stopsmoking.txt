One month in, not thinking about it anymore.

After 30 days, I can’t remember the last time I had to fight with myself about “just one more” or shake my head as I tried to fondly remember smoking. I just don’t do it anymore, so why would I think about it?

For all those starting out, you can make it here too. The agitation goes away, and emotions go back to normal. All the bad stuff is temporary. It will not last. It gets better. Sorry to be repetitive but if I had just convinced myself of this fact — that any negative feelings you have or exhaustion from fighting the addiction will fade, and faster than you think — I would have stuck with it the first ten times I quit. 

Here’s to another smoke-free month ahead, and thank you to everyone on this sub for support.

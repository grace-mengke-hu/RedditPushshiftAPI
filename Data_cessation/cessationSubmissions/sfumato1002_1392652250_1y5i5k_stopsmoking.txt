Heartbroken, got rejected, life seems hopeless...Still not smoking!

Today was a tough day, saw the girl of my dreams...we've known each other for a while...Said hi, she said hi and just told me she had to leave...I know she never like me, but seen her again opened up wounds...I feel like smoking an entire pack! I have to stay strong though...this is hard.

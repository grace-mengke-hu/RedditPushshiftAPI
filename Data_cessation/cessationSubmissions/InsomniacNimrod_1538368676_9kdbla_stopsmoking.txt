Quitting again. And this time for good.

I tried quitting a few months back and the best I did was going without a cigarette for 20 days. Then, one day I got drunk and smoked again. I let it go as a one off mistake but a couple of days later, I was stressed and I smoked one more. Not again. This time I'm quitting for good! Wish me luck. :)

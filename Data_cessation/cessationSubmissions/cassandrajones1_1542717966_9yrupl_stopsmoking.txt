3 days, 14 hours and 33 minutes..

That’s how long I’ve been without having a smoke and I’m feeling good. I picked up some stage 2 patches (smaller amount of nicotine) so I’m not completely nicotine free yet but the urge to smoke is ok. I smoke more when I’m at work, the routine of going for breaks etc. Here I am sat on my lunch break and I’ve found this feed. AMAZING! I haven’t strangled anyone yet so that’s how I know I’m doing ok!

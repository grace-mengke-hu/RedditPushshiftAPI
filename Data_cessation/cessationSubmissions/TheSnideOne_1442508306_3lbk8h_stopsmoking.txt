New High Score!

This is the longest I have gone without nicotine in 20 years. Every day still presents challenges but they also get easier and fewer every single day. My kids love that I don't stink, my wife loves the fact that I may make it to retirement now and I love the fact that I don't wheeze and feel like death 24/7. Will you continue to not smoke with me today?

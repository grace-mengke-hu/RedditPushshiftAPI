Few hours until 4 days, need help not smoking

I had a really stressful day at work. I bailed on a dinner with colleagues because of my social anxiety. I feel terrible about not going. I just feel like if I smoked I would feel better. I know I shouldn't but I need help. My main reason is I don't want my husband to die but I could hide it from him so he wouldn't smoke. We are quitting together.  Help!! Why shouldn't I smoke?!

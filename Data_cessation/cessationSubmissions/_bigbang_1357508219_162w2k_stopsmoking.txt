Day 3.. we meet again. Any solutions for trouble focusing?

Been smoking for about 6 years, average 5-10 per day. I quit for 6 months in 2011, and unfortunately, I didn't notice how great quitting was until I started up again and my body felt like total shit.

In the past few months I've made attempts to cut down, getting down to 1-2 cigs a day, but then relapsing after no more than a few days or a week. Cold turkey (with the odd drunk slip up) was how I did it last time, so I'm going with that. Never had good results with gum either. 

So I'm on day 3, which is always the first hurdle for me. 

College has been a major source of stress this past year, so I know my willpower will have to do overtime. I have a deferred exam to write on Thursday, and start a new semester tomorrow, so I'm short on studying time. What I'm finding is that I keep getting distracted by cravings and trying to control them, or by this feeling of incompleteness because cigarettes are missing from my day. It's becoming really distracting and I'm not very productive or focused on studying. 

Anyone have any tips how I can keep my brain alert and focus on something not at all related to cigarettes?

**tl;dr** I have an exam to study for and all I can think about is cigarettes, help!

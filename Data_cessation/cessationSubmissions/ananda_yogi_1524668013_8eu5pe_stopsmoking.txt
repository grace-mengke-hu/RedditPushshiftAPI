Fixing the mistakes of younger me

I apologize in advance for the vent, thanks for reading.

2018 came so fast. Its been 10 years since I turned 18 and started making my own adult decisions (who decided 18 year olds are old enough to do that??) And boy did I make my fair share of stupid ones. Drugs, alcohol abuse, smoking, debt. Everything that occurred in the first 4-5 formative adult years has stuck with me. Congrats me, you became an alcoholic stoner college dropout smoker. 

Well as you might have guessed, that's not what I always dreamed of being. I want to turn this thing around, and become the person I wanted to be. I am almost 2 months sober (again) from alcohol and it's caused me to take an even harder look at myself. I realized I want my degree and to have qualifications for a career outside of retail, so I started looking into going back to school. 

Enter debt from a defaulted tution payment the year I dropped out. I haven't called the collection agency but I estimate after 7 years, the amount due will be beyond double all the money I have in the world. Now I have to figure out how I'm going to pay this off and start looking at my budget. 

This is what brought me to the conclusion that it's just time. I'm never going to WANT to quit smoking. I just have to do it. It does nothing to actually benefit me.. Its only draining my pockets, my energy, my time, and my health. I have to take control of these things or they will always control me. So I decided this morning, since I'm out of cigarettes, I'm just not going to buy another pack. I'm done smoking. I'm really hoping if I start here, the rest will start to fall in line. I'm posting to stay accountable... I'm a non smoker now.

Phew! Been a tough few weeks! 120 days and counting

Well, what can I say? These last 2 weeks have been, without a doubt, the toughest. This quit, in all honesty, has been relatively easy. I tried quitting thousands of times, but this one, this is the one I wanted, I was so done with it, that it's honestly been easy. Cold turkey as well. But man, the last two weeks have just been horrendous, I've put it down to starting a new job (which I start tomorrow, bit nervous!) and the change of season. I've seen on here, many times, that during a quit, changing of seasons is a real tough one and it's true. As soon as the sun came out, the thought of beer gardens with the sun, fags and booze just seemed so, so good. 

Oh course, I knew this was all bullshit, I haven't smoked, but I won't lie saying I didn't come close, last week, I even rolled one, but I gave it away and moved on! Today, I am feeling much better, it's really eased off in the last 12-15 hours. Thank fuck.

Just stay on guard people, unexpected cravings are so much harder to deal with, you just don't understand them, it's so odd!

Thanks for reading. Good luck quitters!

One year smoke-free! Few observations and advices.

I made it 1 year smoke-free after 4 years of quite heavy smoking and it's really worth it!
Even though virtually every smoker knows about the negative impact of smoking on their health, yet for many of them various reasons like social anxiety because of no smoking outweight that harm that they are inflicting every day on themselves.

So, I just wanted to repeat that quittting smoking is REALLY worth it.

You will feel so much better. Starting from the teeth and breath to the state of your mind. Everything will be clear, **you will retake the full control of your body and your thoughts**. It's an AMAZING feeling of being free of any addiction.

Biggest practical advice I can give for the people who decided to become free is to start chewing a chewing gum or drink water whenever you have serious cravings. It can be really useful first days/weeks. I honestly even started to have a chewing gum addiction :)

***About minor relapses:***

Yes, they might happen.
it's happened to me like 3-4 times during this year and all of these cases occured when I was drunk. So, obviously, better not to drink aclohol especially first weeks/months. But even if you smoked once, don't give up and don't use it as a excuse to smoke more. And don't even start an inner discussion about whether 1 cigarette is ok because your you will loose it.

Good luck to everyone and believe me it's easier than you think :)

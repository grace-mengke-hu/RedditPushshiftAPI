2 days in and - OH MY GOD I CAN FEEL IT EVERYWHERE

Seriously, what the actual fuck nicotine?!?!?

This cunt substance really doesn't want to let go. Literally the only thing keeping me from rolling a cigarette is that it would restart the process all over gain and I'd enter this stage again. It's a pretty flimsy defence against the urge I have to say.

Given that I'm trying desperately hard to focus on my university exams for this semester, and I've got a very important interview in two days, what the fuck do you guys recommend for 'forgetting' (as much as humanly possible, anyway) that rampant urge crawling around your nicotine deprived body every waking moment?

Most pertinently, does the I-really-want-you-brown-gold-all-the-time feeling pass after a week? Or sooner??

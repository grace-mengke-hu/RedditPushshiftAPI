It has been 5 days

I'm proud of myself. Ive been taking the metro here in Los Angeles and if any of you have ridden the red line you know the amount of steps that are from the bottom of the station to the very top. Usually I would be out of breath once I got to the top and would need to take a couple of minutes to fully catch my breath now I can walk up the steps and be fully recovered within a couple of seconds. No more being paranoid if I'm breathing too heavy because of my smoking.

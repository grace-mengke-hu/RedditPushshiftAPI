I'm 6 weeks in and I feel like extreme stress is gonna make me crack! Wtf!?

This is no normal stress.   This is xxxxxxxxx stress.   I thought I was through the worst of it....but the only thing I can think of to calm down is to smoke.  Tried, diet exercise, meditation, walks.  Even got some anxiety meds from my Dr.   


Trying to be strong...i just can't believe after so long and so much success I'm susceptible to a relapse ... Not sure if anyone can help... Just a rant I guess.  Let me know if you can!


Edit: xxxxxxxxx

Edit 2:   OK.   I'm over it.... Thanks for helping.   In to the next 40 days

Day 50: DONE! Thank you all.

Thanks friends. You guys have made the mental battle so much more manageable. I'm glad I can count on /r/stopsmoking. This quit has been easier and stronger willed than previous attempts and I owe it to you all.

It's still tough as hell, and I battle almost everyday, but I'll continue to take it one day at a time. Not one puff ever.

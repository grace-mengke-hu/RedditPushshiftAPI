My quitting journey: I have no friends

I decided to cut the butts last January, and although I have a puff here or there to get over the smell of other people smoking around me, I still consider myself quit. When I am around people smoking the smell really bothers me, but if I have a puff, I can deal.  
When I quit it was part of a holistic initiative to get myself healthy before I hit 25. I started yoga for the stress and for exercise, I improved my diet and most days eat 2 our of 4 meals raw, quit wearing bras (before then my back pain was insane), and quit using sulfate soaps.  Everything is going great, I feel healthy, look great, and I am becoming more and more happy with myself and my life EXCEPT for my social life.  
I moved to NY since I quit smoking and at some point came to the realization that ALL of my best friends, I met through smoking. I also realized that I SUCK at socializing now for some reason. What about smoking a cigarette made it so easy to talk to people? Was it the camaraderie? Like we already have something in common?  Taking the time to take a drag was just long enough to think of something witty o engaging?  
I am the kind of person that makes friends wherever I go, or at least I was. I try to talk to people and they just look at me strangely. I'm no longer in school, I don't have a job, I'm too broke to go to bars. I tried meet ups but the other girls just ignore me because maybe I am not hip enough or I look scary I really have no idea but people have been doing that to me my whole life. My friends from home tell me I am intimidating and I really don't know what that means (I know what the words means but I'm 5'3" and a veritable nincompoop so it just confuses me).   
tl;dr: Any other ex smokers find themselves unable to make friends or socialize? Any solutions?

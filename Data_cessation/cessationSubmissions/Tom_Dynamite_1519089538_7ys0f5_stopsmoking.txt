Quit two days ago. Anything I should expect?

Smoked since I was 16 (now 28). Used to roll my own cigarettes, which was one bag of tobacco a week (so around 6 packs a week). Cut it down this past year to basically half of that. Only smoked when I was drinking my morning coffee, after lunch and dinner and 2-3 at work or at home when I had the day off. 

So Saturday I decided to quit after my bag of tobacco was empty and I smoked my last cigarette. It was somewhat spontaneous, but I did think about quitting a few times recently. Didn't taste good to me anymore. Felt like the right time. Yesterday was no problem. I thought about it a few times, didn't crave it at all though. Today I did crave it a little during my coffee and later after dinner. I just distracted myself while drinking coffee by playing on my phone and just took a walk after dinner. 

Right now I still feel great, but it's only 2 days so I don't wanna get too excited yet. Is there anything I should expect? I used to be a strong smoker when drinking, any advice what I can do then?

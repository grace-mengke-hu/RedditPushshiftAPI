I thought I'd share how I successfully went from being a smoker to a vaper to smoke/vape free

I smoked regular cigarettes for about 6 years, and then have been vaping for about 8 years up until two months ago.

Quitting smoking was easy, when replaced with an e-cig that replicated the burn in the back of the throat feeling, and slowly lowering the nicotine dose overtime helped with times where I didn't have an e-cig on me, or forgot to charge it.

However, recently for the hell of it, I switched from nicotine e-liquid to CBD e-liquid. It literally replaced the need for nicotine from day one, and it had the advantage of weening me off of the physical addiction since unlike nicotine, CBD can't get you physically addicted.

Now two months ago, I switched from CBD to nothing and it took literally no effort. The routine is sometimes in the back of my head, but the cravings are non-existent.

What I personally realized, was the nicotine or CBD itself wasn't calming me, but it was the reward when giving into the cravings. So the addiction in and of itself was relaxing. However, I noted over time that it was a double edged sword and potentially created more imbalance than balance. I hope this was either interesting or helpful for those that read it.

**TLDR**: For those wanting to quit I recommend going from cigarettes, to e-cig with nicotine, to e-cig with CBD, to smoke/vape free.

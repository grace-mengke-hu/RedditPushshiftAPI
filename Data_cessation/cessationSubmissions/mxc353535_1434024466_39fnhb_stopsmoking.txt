Stopping smoking after 2 a day

I have been smoking 1 or 2 a day for about 15 months with several more on weekends and have recently quit completely. Most benefit timelines I've seen online seem to apply to heavier smokers. Would I be observing benefits on the same timescale or should mine come faster? It has been almost 2 weeks so what should I have noticed? Thanks!

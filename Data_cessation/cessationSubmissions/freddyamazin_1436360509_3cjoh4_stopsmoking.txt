3 Days... not sure?

Okay, so this is my 3rd day without smoking or having a nicotine in my body and I don't want a cigarette. However, I don't feel that great and it's tempting to just smoke to feel as good as I usually do. I can't really concrete on anything and keep getting irritated by such small things. Any advice would be truly appreciated! Thank you.

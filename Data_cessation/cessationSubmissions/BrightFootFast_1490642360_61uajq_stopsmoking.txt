On Day 8: Wow, Me, You, We

I started running several months ago. No major goals, it just looked fun. And it was. It is. 

I'm 38. I've smoked for over 20 years. Last 5 or so years at two packs a day. 

On St Pats I ran a 5k. I've done several, but this one hurt. My lungs were about to explode and I wasn't sure why. I spent the weekend feeling sore and sick. 

So I quit at 9:00am last Monday. I've never even tried to quit for more than a day. My entire adult life....smoking. 

I've been lurking and searching this sub over the last week. Thank you for all of the tips and happy posts left here over several years. I mostly did cold turkey, but I used 2mg gum 3-4 times a day for the first three days. I'm not sure it did much, but it took the edge off (placebo?) and kept me from eating people. 

I am feeling wonderful now. And setting PRs like crazy. Almost under a 10 minute mile at last. Ordered a new Garmin Forerunner watch with the money saved. ðŸ˜Š

Probably going back into lurker mode, but wanted to say Thank You for letting me soak up your wisdom ;)

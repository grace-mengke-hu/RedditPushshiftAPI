Showerthought instead of having an age limit to start smoking, they should have an age limit that you can't smoke after!

If I was forced to stop by law to smoking at age 25 I'd be pretty healthy right now. Am I right?

I'm dealing with some breathing issues now at age 32 still doing tests but its looking like copd. 
Which is a death sentence. 
I'm full of doom and gloom. 

Quiting tonight even tho I truley think its too late. I've had some panic moments before but this feels perament and much more serious than anything before.

Who on here has copd? I wanna hear how it feels. Something feels damaged in my airway like numb I cant cough phelm up anymore I wheeze when I exhale and ive been getting chest pain and back pain. Doctors dont really have any answers for me yet. I understand copd is tested by time ... Same test over and over to see downward progress. 

Life is cruel.

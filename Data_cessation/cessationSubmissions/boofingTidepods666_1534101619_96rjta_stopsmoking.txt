Approaching my quit date

american here out abroad in europe, and over the past 2 weeks ive realized its time to give up the cancer sticks. i was a daily pot smoker as well but ive been 15 days sober while backpacking and honestly really really want both habits gone. Ive decided im quitting the day i fly back and im gonna use the long plane flight as an excuse to jump start the process. My question is if anyone has tried useing natural smokeing herbs such as mullien or sage to help them quit, and if so how well did it work? I thibk if it did work it would be useful to be able to roll up "fake ciggarettes" or " fake bong rips" to make quitting both weed and cigarettes that much easier on myself.

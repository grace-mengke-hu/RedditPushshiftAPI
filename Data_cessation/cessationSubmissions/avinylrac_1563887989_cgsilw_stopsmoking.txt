Struggling to find a replacement activity

Hey everyone!

Ive been following and lurking on this sub for months to absorb all of the motivation that this community has to offer. I'm finally ready to join as an active nonsmoker, seeking some advice from the pros. 

After ten years, im finally quitting smoking cigarettes for good. It was the cool thing to do when I was a teenager but I dont want any of my cousins to follow in my footsteps. My parents have smoked for my entire life and I grew up watching them smoke and being forced to sit in the smoky, smelly air. Besides them, only one other family member smokes and none of my current friends smoke. Luckily, i dont have too many temptations around. 

I finished my last pack last Wednesday and had spent two/three weeks of limiting my smoking to 1-3 per day, usually smoking them late at night. This was always the furthest I got into quitting - only having a couple per day until a big stressful event happens in my life and then its back to half a pack per day. This time im more determined than ever to quit. I finally graduated from college and got a new job and i want to be smoke free to enjoy my life without smelling bad and having terrible breath! 

The biggest struggle is finding something to occupy my hands with. Ive started eating *anything* I can get my hands on and it kinda sucks because i just got myself in great shape over the past couple months. I feel like that progress will be gone if I keep eating like this. Sometimes when I have a craving, I will go straight to the gym but there are times where thats not always possible. 

Can you recommend some other ways to occupy the mind and hands instead? Especially for the downtime late at night when im bored but not tired for bed yet.

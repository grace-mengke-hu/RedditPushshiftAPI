Will the cigarette cravings ever go away?

A friend of mine, who was smoking for 15 years and quit 3 years ago, told me "There isn't a single morning where I wake up and I'm not craving for a cigarette, still". The thought of that fills me with fear. Will I always start my days thinking, damn I need to smoke? Or does it depend on the person? I've been smoking a pack a day for 6 years now (well, until 6 days ago). Do you guys who are clean for years manage to completely forget about smoking?

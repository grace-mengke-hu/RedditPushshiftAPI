Has anyone else had the same experience where breathing while exercising is a million times harder?

I started running last year and run a 2-3miles at least 3 times a week. Today was my first day seriously running since I've quit and it was beyond painful. A mile in it felt like my lungs were going to explode, I was coughing like crazy, it was almost unbearable. Before I had quit I had a lot of phlegm that sometimes made it hard to run but it definitely was not that painful.

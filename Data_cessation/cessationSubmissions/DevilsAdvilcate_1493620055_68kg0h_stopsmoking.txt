Had the smoking dream

It's been a few months (again) and this is the first time I had the smoking dream. It came out of nowhere, and in the moment it felt so good. Then I woke up, first feeling ashamed at first, then realizing it was all a dream I felt liberated and free. In reality, I know that first smoke would taste horrible, but then I'd be chasing down the second. This community keeps me strong.

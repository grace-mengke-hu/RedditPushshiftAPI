Chantix, anyone tried it?

Hello,
I am posting this for my significant other. He's interested in quitting smoking. He wants to try Chantix, but he is weary of going for it because of how expensive it gets. Granted cigarettes are expensive... but has anyone tried Chantix? 

How long of a process is it? I have heard from different people that it can be as short as 2 weeks to as long as a few months.

How did it affect you emotionally (I have heard that it can cause depression and other side effects)?

How long were you on it?


Thanks in advance for your answers!

Too late for gum?

I'm at the end of day 3 cold turkey.  Craving a lot and sorta panicky from resisting.  Part of me wants to use some nicotine gum (my husband is also quitting, he's using gum).  But,  I figure most of the nicotine is out of my system at this point,  so would it make it worse to give my body more nicotine?  Would using him at this point help or hurt more?

How hard is quitting cigarettes compared to benzos.

5-6 a day for a year or so.

I've read online that the withdrawals are wrose than benzos. Which fucking terrifies me. I have no problems being irritable and cranky for a bit but when I was benzo withdrawing I felt like I was going to hop out of my skin. It was fucking horrible. I would cry myself to sleep and vomit and couldn't leave the house for weeks.

Is it really that bad? What am I in for?

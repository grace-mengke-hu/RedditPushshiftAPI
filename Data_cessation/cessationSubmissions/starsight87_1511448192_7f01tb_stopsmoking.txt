Day 5 - It's a struggle but mostly a quiet one

One of the things I can say is after so many times trying to quit, announcing it was going to happen is that I just don't feel entitled to reach out that much anymore. It always feels like my actions don't line up with my words and I just need to find a way to support myself because it isn't fair to my family. 

I don't know why I keep going back, maybe there are just parts of my life that I don't know how to resolve and it leads to me underestimating the nature of my own goals. Maybe I just think about it too much and don't let it fall into the backdrop of my life. At this point I don't know and just feel lost. 

I want to quit but maybe at this time I don't have the energy or tools to understand where this fits in the bigger picture. All I know is that today I will not smoke and hopefully that is enough. Tomorrow, I will find what I need to make the same decision.

about a week in, looking for some comforting words

last week i was in the hospital with an infection caused by bad dentistry. when i got out the smell of smoke and the taste was just absolutely disgusting.

in the hospital they gave me 14mg nicotine patches, but the box says that based on how much i smoke i should have started with much more in the patch, like double the amount, so i figure i'm on half the nicotine i normally am? idk it's been a week on this dose and i think i'm going to stick with it for a month and then move down to the 7mg for the two weeks the box says and then nothing. i am surviving, this is possible, but some things are harder than others.

how do you get out of bed in the morning? the first thing i think about is having a morning smoke and it's suddenly hard to get out of bed in the morning, like when i was a teenager, before i was on anti-depressants.  of course, i'm also on a really strong antibiotic and am still recovering from my damn infection, maybe i needed to sleep in today anyway. today i woke up, cried about cigarettes, and went back to bed until one pm. 

i keep reading 'avoid your triggers' but dude waking up is a trigger. i can't avoid waking up.

Day 24: Smoke bothered me today

Today, someone else’s smoke made my throat feel scratchy and I coughed and felt like I needed something to drink. And the whole time, I was still thinking “id still like the nicotine part though.” Its so crazy when you can clearly see that you don’t want to smoke at all. You just want to feed the addiction. 

And its amazing to be able to say I do not want to smoke, and mean it!

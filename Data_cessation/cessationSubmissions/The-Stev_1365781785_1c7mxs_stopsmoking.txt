Off the wagon but getting right back on

I could make excuses saying i was drunk and that it was offered at a bad time but the truth is i caved quite willingly and im ashamed. I thought i had already quit but i keep convincing myself that smoking one ever now and then is fine. damn well im gonna keep at it. Day one here we go.

Almost two months with only a couple of "cheats"

I started taking Chantix Nov 10, for a Nov 17 quit date. Since then, the Chantix has helped *a lot*. I hardly ever have cravings, and no noticeable side-effects.

I have cheated 3 times. Twice I bought a pack just for a single smoke (I immediately threw away the 19 remaining cigs), and this past weekend I bummed one from someone after a flight. All three of my cheaters have been thoroughly unpleasant. Burning in my throat, bad taste, and no fix (I think that's the Chantix). I have another month remaining on the Chantix and hope I can stay quit (without cheating) for the rest of my life.

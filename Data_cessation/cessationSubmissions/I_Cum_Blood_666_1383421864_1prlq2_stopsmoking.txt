Summary:  

-Lynn Kozlowski, a prominent
American smoking and nicotine addiction expert at Penn
State University, noted in 1984 and 1989 that ST products
conferred fewer risks to users and therefore might serve as
effective substitutes for cigarettes Starting in 1994, University of Alabama at Birmingham
researchers Brad Rodu and Philip Cole provided a quantitative
assessment of the difference in risks for the two
products. Using established risk estimates from accepted
sources, Rodu and Cole documented that **ST(smokeless tobacco) use confers
only about 2% of the health risks of smoking** [10-12]. In
addition, they established that **the average reduction in
life expectancy from long-term ST use was about 15 days,
compared with a reduction of about 8 years from smoking**  
  

-In 2002 the Royal College of Physicians of London, one of
the oldest and most prestigious medical societies in the
world, issued a report called "Protecting Smokers, Saving
Lives," which stated, "As a way of using nicotine, **the consumption
of non-combustible [smokeless] tobacco is on
the order of 10â€“1,000 times less hazardous than smoking**,
depending on the product." The report continued with an
even bolder statement, acknowledging that some smokeless
tobacco manufacturers may want to market their
products "as a 'harm reduction' option for nicotine users,
and they may find support for that in the public health
community" [128]  
  

-In 2004 a study funded by the NCI assembled an international
panel of experts (including epidemiologists from
the NIH and the ACS) to compare the risks of ST use with
those of smoking. The study authors reported that, "In
comparison with smoking, **experts perceive at least a 90%
reduction in the relative risk of low-nitrosamine smokeless
tobacco use**." The authors concluded that "This finding
raises ethical questions concerning whether it is
inappropriate and misleading for government officials or
public health experts to characterize smokeless tobacco
products as comparably dangerous with cigarette smoking"
[129].  
  

-Phillips et al. have provided perhaps the most detailed
and direct comparison of risks from use of Swedish or
American ST products and from smoking, using a spectrum
of risk estimates for ST use ranging from well-substantiated
and plausible to highly speculative and
implausible [130]. They estimated that, **compared with
smoking, ST risks "in the range of 1% or 2%, and possibly
less, are most consistent with the epidemiologic evidence**.  
  

-**Risk of Cancer in Various Sites Associated with ST Use and Smoking:
Pharynx: No relationship  
Larynx: No relationship  
Lung: Inadequate  
Stomach: Not persuasive   
Kidney: No association  
Esophagus: Not persuasive  
Pancreatic cancer: Inconclusive  
Bladder cancer: None**  
  

-In 1994 Rodu noted that **ST use posed a lower risk for
mouth cancer than smoking** [10]. In 2001 this was confirmed
by a comprehensive report on tobacco harm reduction
by the Institute of Medicine, which stated that **"the
overall [oral cancer] risk [for ST use] is lower than for cigarette
smoking, and some products such as Swedish snus
may have no increased risk"** [15].  
  

-National Board of Health and Welfare concluded that "the
health risks related to smokeless tobacco are with great
probability **lower** than those related to smoking" [41].  
  

-The established health risks associated with ST use are
**vastly lower** than those of smoking.  
  

-In 2004 a study funded by the NCI assembled an international
panel of experts (including epidemiologists from
the NIH and the ACS) to compare the risks of ST use with
those of smoking. The study authors reported that, "In

reduction in the relative risk of low-nitrosamine smokeless
tobacco use**." The authors concluded that "This finding
raises ethical questions concerning whether it is
inappropriate and misleading for government officials or
public health experts to characterize smokeless tobacco
products as comparably dangerous with cigarette smoking"
[129].  
  

-Americans are badly misinformed about the risks of ST
use, especially in comparison with smoking. In 2005 a
survey of 2,028 adult U.S. smokers found that only 10.7%
correctly believed that ST products are less hazardous than
cigarettes [154]. In another survey, 82% of U.S. smokers
incorrectly believed that chewing tobacco is just as likely
to cause cancer as smoking cigarettes [162].  
  

-In 2005 the American Cancer Society (ACS) reported that
**ST users did not have significantly increased risks for oral
and pharyngeal cancer** in either the first or the second
Cancer Prevention Study [92]. Despite this finding, the
ACS website continues to focus on ST as a cause of mouth
cancer, erroneously stating that "risk of cancer of the
cheek and gums may increase nearly 50-fold among longterm
snuff users"  
  


-"the abundance of data now available indicates that commonly
used ST products increase the risk of oral and
upper respiratory tract cancers only **minimally**."  
  

-These investigators commented that many claims in
the media "overemphasize the risk of oral cavity cancer
[from ST use], reaching beyond the scientific data."

-control for alcohol consumption in all studies probably would
have reduced somewhat many of the estimates of mouth
cancer risk associated with ST use.

-Two of the seven studies on moist snuff were Swedish,
both appearing in 1998 [78,79]. These studies have
received considerable attention among tobacco researchers,
particularly in Europe, because they are viewed as
showing **no oral cancer risk for Swedish products**  
  

-Lynn Kozlowski, a prominent
American smoking and nicotine addiction expert at Penn

conferred fewer risks to users and therefore might serve as

**life expectancy from long-term ST use was about 15 days,
compared with a reduction of about 8 years from smoking**  
  

-Chewing tobacco has been studied at least once in each of
four decades from the 1960s to the 1990s. The data clearly
show that chewing tobacco use is associated with only
**slightly elevated** cancer risks  
  

-epidemiologic studies
dating back to the 1950s provide convincing evidence
that most ST products increase oral cancer risks only minimally.  
  

-"The 'not safe' or 'not harmless' messages
don't address the reality that some tobacco products are
substantially safer than others  
  

-As noted above, cigarette smoking is associated with
increased risk for several cancers in locations not in contact
with cigarette smoke. In comparison, numerous epidemiologic
studies have not demonstrated that ST use is
associated with risk of cancer at any site outside the
mouth.  
  

-Over the past 15 years, eight epidemiologic studies have
examined the risk of cardiovascular diseases among ST
users. Six of the studies found that **ST users had no increased risk for heart attacks or strokes** [47,90,97-100].  
  

-He concluded that, in distinct contrast
to smokers, **ST users do not exhibit any significant
differences from nonusers of tobacco** with regard to the
following measures of cardiovascular health: heart rate,
blood pressure, cardiac output and maximal working
capacity, levels of hemoglobin and hematocrit, leukocytes,
antioxidant vitamins, fibrinogen, components of
the fibrinolytic system, C-reactive protein and thromboxane
A2 production. In addition, ST users did not show
important smoking-associated vascular changes, including
increased thickness of blood vessels and atherosclerotic
plaque development. In summary, most of the
medical and epidemiologic evidence documents that ST
users do not have elevated risks for cardiovascular diseases.  
  

-But nicotine itself poses little or no health hazard. For
example, it does not cause emphysema or cancer
[105,106], and there is no evidence that it plays a direct
role in the development of cardiovascular diseases
[106,107]. A report from a meeting at the United Nations
Focal Point on Tobacco or Health concluded that "longterm
nicotine use is not of demonstrated harm, with the
possible exception of use during pregnancy" [108].  
  

-In 1994 Rodu noted that **ST use posed a lower risk for
mouth cancer than smoking** [10]. In 2001 this was confirmed
by a comprehensive report on tobacco harm reduction
by the Institute of Medicine, which stated that "the
overall [oral cancer] risk [for ST use] is lower than for cigarette
smoking, and some products such as **Swedish snus
may have no increased risk**" [15].  
  

-If ST use is 50 to 100 times less hazardous than smoking, it would require 50 to 100 more ST users to
reach the level of public harm produced by smoking. In
other words, it would take 2.3 to 4.5 billion ST users to
have the same death toll as 45 million American smokers
do today, an impossible scenario in the U.S. population of
290 million people.

Nearly 6 months!

Had to check in for the first time in a while. I'm 3-4 days shy of my 6-month mark, and was so excited. Unfortunately I am checking in because today I was talking on the phone with my brother, and could hear him inhaling/exhaling his cigarette and it drove me over the edge. I bought a pack of my favorite smokes and smoked half a pack.

After smoking them, realizing how discusting they were, and how they made me feel nauseous, I crushed the rest of the pack, showered and the brushed my teeth. I just got my teeth cleaned the other day. I just realized how clean they feel compared to when I smoked. And this was after only half a pack.

I'm disappointed with myself for caving just like that. I let my guard down because I have been smoke-free for so long and thought I wouldn't have that irresistible urge again. I started to reset my app, but have decided not to. Resetting it would make me feel like all my progress was lost to that half pack, but this was just a speed bump along the way. I slipped up, but will wake up tomorrow with renewed vigilance in my endeavor.

Good luck to everyone, keeping fighting that good fight!

Smoking is just a habit of mine.

Really, the only thing I really crave are the breaks in my daily routine where I dont do anything. My body doesnt act abnormaly when I stop, besides a little dizzines, but this doesnt bother me much. 
Its just the point that I think about smoking when I stop smoking because I cant have something I had before. If im working all day and dont think about smoking then there is no difference for me in my day, I most likely dont even feel the dizzines then. But I rarely have days like this. So how should I approach my new start?
Yes I should break the habit but then? How can I mentally not think about something when my life isnt that full of other stuff that keeps me from think about smoking?
Your thoughts would be appreciated.

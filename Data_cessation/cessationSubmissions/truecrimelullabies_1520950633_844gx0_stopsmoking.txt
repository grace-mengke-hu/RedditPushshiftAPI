I’m 2 years clean from drugs, 361 days clean from booze...why am I psyching myself out from quitting cigs?

I feel like I’m a professional quitter, lol. I beat an opiate and benzo addiction (wow withdrawals) and alcoholism. Cigs tho....phew, I’m terrified. I have a severe panic disorder so even tho I know that cigs don’t actually calm, I know that stopping them will introduce anxiety which is a bad trigger for me. I want to stop, NOW.

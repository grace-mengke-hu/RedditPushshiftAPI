Anyone can screw up.

As of posting this I am at 294 days without a cigarette.  Tonight, I had some drinks and got pretty toasty.  I was looking through some boxes and found my kit for self-rolling cigarettes.  I had a baggie of tobacco with just enough left to roll one cigarette.  I'm afraid I did it.  I rolled it up and smoked it.  Even though the tobacco was stale as hell, it felt so good.  That was about ten minutes ago, and I already regret it.  I know that when I wake up in the morning I will be sorry, and that I will renew my desire to quit.  As I sit here typing I can smell it on myself and taste it in my mouth even though I brushed my teeth.  Everyone makes mistakes, and just because you have one does not mean you need to give up.  Stay strong, friends.  You can stay smoke free even if you make a mistake.

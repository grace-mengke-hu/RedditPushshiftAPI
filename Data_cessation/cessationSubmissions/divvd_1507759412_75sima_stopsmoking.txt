It's true? Is this my last pack?

As I was walking home from the smoke shop today I realized the taste was nasty something didn't feel right something  felt really already, like I didn't feel like myself, something felt wrong. I asked myself is this my last pack? Is this my last time? This is the last time I spend six bucks on a  pack of smokes? I really had to know can you guys help me out? What do I do what can I do ?

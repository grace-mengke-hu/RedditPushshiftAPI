How did you set a date?

So I'm going for it. 26 years old. Smoking for 10 years. Have had enough of this shit. I'm going balls to the wall, do or do not mentality. Cold turkey baby! 

So I'm curious, how did you guys set a date? Was it random? Was it "this pack and then tomorrow start fresh"? 
Just curious. 

Thanks guys and gals. And gratz to everyone's success.

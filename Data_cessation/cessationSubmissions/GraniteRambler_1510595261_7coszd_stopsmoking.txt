I'm not STOPPING smoking, I'm STARTING my life as a non-smoker.

This subtle shift in framing helped me make it through my first weekend smoke-free. I had been thinking about quitting as NOT doing something, but this only made me want it more. When I started thinking about quitting as DOING something (i.e. living my life without cigarettes), it started to feel a lot easier!
  
Another framing trick that I am using is the conception of non-smoking as a lifestyle choice. I've been a vegetarian for half my life, making it now part of my identity – rather than a series of individual decisions not to eat meat on any given day. I'm trying to position being smoke-free in the same way: a lasting lifestyle decision rather than a series of daily avoidances.

What other framing "tricks" have proved helpful to you?

I'm on day 2 of no nicotine and I'm having a really hard time. It's beyond just cravings; I'm having a nervous breakdown

I'm getting nicotine tested for work so I've stopped smoking / gumming / patching in preparation. Yesterday I was just crabby and lightheaded with funky vision but today it is like psychological warfare is being waged on my fragile psyche.

I suddenly hate myself and everyone around me. I'm fat and unattractive and no wonder my ex cheated on me over a year ago. I'm swirling down a rabbit hole here and I've been crying for the past 3 hours straight.  My head and eyes are too messed up for me to drive anywhere so I'm considering a walk in the 90 degree sun just to do something with myself. I can't seem to get out of the mental fog. Help!

**EDIT** DAY THREE: Working out helped for a little bit. I keep catching myself grinding my teeth. But hey, still clean.

Hey guys I need some advice

I'm getting some severe cravings, I stopped smoking/vaping about 2 days ago and I'm on the patch but it's really not doing it right now. Is it safe or recommend to use two patches if cravings are intense? I'm on the 21mg CVS patches? Sidenote where's the best place to put them, I've been putting them on my lower arm because that's the only part of my upper body that's not covered in hair but I was thinking about putting them on my neck instead, thanks guys

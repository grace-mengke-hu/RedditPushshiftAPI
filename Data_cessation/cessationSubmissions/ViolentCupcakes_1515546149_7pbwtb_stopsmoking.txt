4 Days in and Proud Dispite What Other People Say.

Came home early from work so I could have my self a nice ugly cry. Day 4 no cigarettes and my one coworker who still smokes basically told me to get off my high horse, no one cares and I have no reason to be proud of my self because I will probably go back to smoking anyway.   Of course I know that isn't the case and it doesn't matter I am still going to be proud of myself. I am not quitting for him. I am quitting for my self. 

Regardless, that interaction with him and then the big fight we ended up having about me being his manager and him needed to do more around the store, have been the two times I have honestly wanted a cigarette.  I didn't go to the corner store, I went home instead. 

There is a quote from Dale Cooper in Twin Peaks "Harry, I'm going to let you in on a little secret. Every day, once a day, give yourself a present. Don't plan it. Don't wait for it. Just let it happen. It could be a new shirt at the men's store, a catnap in your office chair, or two cups of good, hot black coffee." I am a big believer that doing that greatly improves my overall happiness, and self esteem. I am going to go get a cup of coffee and get a new color of nail polish. I feel like I deserve it. 

I won't smoke today

Edit: Fixed some words. Also wanted to add in no way did I feel like I was bragging about quitting. I had coworkers who I haven't seen in a few days that I was letting know, but that was it. It reminded me very much of when I got off dope and I had an old using friend react the same way. In the end it was just because they were scared of getting clean them self that they lashed out like that.

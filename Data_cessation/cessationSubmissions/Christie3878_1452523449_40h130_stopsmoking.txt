Day 4 without nicotine

Hi everyone! Just thought I'd share my current effort to stop smoking here: I am 38 years old and this is my 5th attempt to stop smoking. The previous ones lasted from 2 to 3 months up to 3 years. I really hate smoking and the taste and smell of cigarettes but I think that subconsciously I have equated smoking with the only "rebellious" aspect of my personality and tend to go back to it even though I hate it. In the past I have read almost all the books written to help smokers quit, including Allen Carr's which, admittedly helped immensely. Now I am using the AA approach of "one day at a time". Today I choose not to smoke. Anyway, wish me luck and best of luck to all the quitters in the world! This is really such a meaningless habit/addiction...

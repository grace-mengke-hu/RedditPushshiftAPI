8 months smoke free, but today I'm fighting.

Quit smoking 8 months ago. Didn't have to fight withdrawals that much, wasn't pleasant, but not as bad as when I attempted before. 

Today, however, I'm hanging on for dear life. In my mind I'm already puffing on a cancer-stick, and I hope that slamming my fingers to the keyboard will help that image disolve, and not make itself manifest.

The events of today encapsulate all that I I have sought nicotine to celebrate, alleviate and comfort. Milestones were met professionaly, meeting them caused stress. I want that mix of calm and cool that's attached to the idea of me taking a deep, long drag of a freshly sparked cigarette.

Which goes to show how addicted I continue to be to this devil-drug. I know full well the realities of how harmfull smoking is. But the idea of it, the perfect cigarette, the great release of tension that will come from just one hit. Which will be followed by a desire to vomit, dizzyness and a sore throat.

I worship the idea of smoking. But worshiping idealized forms is not a sustainable way of imparting meaning to the real world. So I promise myself, as the fog of ideal realms part, I will not smoke.

Sorry for rambling. Any tips on staving off these intense moments of craving? Just writing about it, and going to the source of the cravings helped a lot, the vision of myself as a smoker again seems more distant and unreal by each passing moment.

Took a puff, tasted like shit.

I switched to ecigs last month at the behest of my fiancee.  I loved it immediately.  Well, i took a puff of a bummed cigarette after a fucking long restaurant shift because my battery had died.  It tasted horrible, like taking a bite of a slim jim when you wanted steak.  I put it out and went home.  

I was so scared of losing will-power once and falling back into old habits, but i'm glad my tastes want me to stay quit just as much as my mind does.

Is this normal? Day 3

3 days, 4 hours. Been smoking 22+ years. 
All day, I felt fine. Didn’t even need NRT inhaler. 

Day 1 I hated the world and everyone in it. It was touch and go all day. 
Day 2 I was better but still a bit distracted and anxious. I only hated smokers who were smoking when I told myself I wasn’t allowed to. I also ate so many carrot sticks I ended up with a super sore stomach.
Day 3, not a craving. A couple of “I’d usually have a cigarette now” thoughts but easily ignored. 

Day 3 has felt too easy. Is my body setting me up for a fall?

ItÂ´s being a while

Yes, I try to smoke every couple of years, yes, I usually last as much as 4 or 5 months and then succumb to the temptation (more so if I am with people that smoke, or go out drinking) YES, I feel like I shouldn't have tried to stop smoking but you know what? may be stopping for a while is actually helping me with life, and I wont stop trying to quit, even if I can only quit for a few months every two years, that is helping me much more than just keeping smoking...

And I want to stop forever, although I am less optimistic now that its my 5th time trying...

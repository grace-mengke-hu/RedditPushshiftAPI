lighters....

Now that I've quit I FUCKING FIND LIGHTERS ALL OVER THE GOD DAMN PLACE

When I smoked regularly I'd NEVER have a lighter. I'd buy them all the fucking time and they disappeared. I was going through my bag the other day : 3 lighters. I found 5 lighters around my room, 3 in my car, 2 in my jacket and then random one's in random pant pockets and hoodies.

What gives. I have lost count of how many times I was scrambling for a light from someone. Now all my lighters are coming out when I no longer need them.

I use a stop smoking app that keeps track of your progress, called Livestrong Quit Smoking. Would highly recommend. I spend $100 a *month* on cigs, $1200 a year... Wow! That's a lot of smoke in my lungs and a lot of lost cash. Now that I'm not drinking, toking, or smoking, I won't be living paycheck to paycheck anymore.

How much??

Day 31 and my app says I’ve saved over £250. How stupid is that to have paid so much for something that was killing me?
Went out last night with a smoker pal. Once on a previous quit attempt he had offered me smokes and I’d given in. Didn’t happen last night. Funnily enough I had a rare craving before going out to meet him but was completely fine while I was there. 
It’s getting easier all the time.

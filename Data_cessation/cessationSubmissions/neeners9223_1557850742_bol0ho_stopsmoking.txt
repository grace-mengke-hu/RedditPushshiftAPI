Does nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) increase TSNA &amp; risk for cancer after cessation of tobacco use?

I remember reading a couple studies that state that the inhalation of nicotine via e-cigs or vaping caused no significant increase in TSNA (cancer causing agents) whereas oral muscosa delivery methods saw increase. I use Nicotine lozenges almost everyday (dipper for 10 years) so Iâ€™m curious as to more info on TSNA and its harmful effects in general.

Appreciate any insight!

Day 4 now - Over the hump?

Well, im on 90 hours now, with this being my 4th day completely without nicotine.
Yesterday evening I almost caved, because the cravings were so bad. I told myself: "You're going to go to bed, and if the cravings are still this bad in the morning, you can have a cig."
What can I say, the cravings were gone in the morning. They are powerless over you, provided you give yourself the time. They can hurt you temporarily, but the only thing that does damage to you in the long term is giving in to that stupid drug.

Writing this as motivation and future reminder to myself and hopefully others.
Stay strong, I will not smoke together with you today. ‚ù§

Coughing in morning, feels like water on my chest.

Past couple of days I've had a cough in the morning. Sort of feels like water on my chest and I cough up little white chunks sometimes.

Might just be the start of a sore throat, my son has a nasty cough which has taken weeks to clear up.

I'm just over 100 days into my stopping smoking and was wondering if it's related.

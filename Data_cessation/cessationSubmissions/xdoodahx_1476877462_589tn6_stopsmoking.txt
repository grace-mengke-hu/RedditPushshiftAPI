Day 19, my real struggle

I've not been too bad up to now...  The coughing is unpleasant and I have missed smoking but today.... I'm back into my work routine and I really want to smoke. I know its just the habit though. For me the routine and habit is the hardest to break. I have my ecig but it's not quite the same. I'm struggling with the idea of being a non smoker. Why is this setting off my anxiety? Surely being a non smoker is a good thing....

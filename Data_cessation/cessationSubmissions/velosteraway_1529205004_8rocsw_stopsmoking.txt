I think I am slowly becoming a smoker

I just realised i am becoming addicted. I live with a smoker and since april he started giving me cig everytime he go out to smoke. Since I feel like I owe him some, I bought a pack to share with him but I smoked it all in less than 3 day.  Today I was feeling stressed out because of my job so I bought a new pack. Now I feel like I should just throw them in the sink before it srart becoming an issue. I don't know what to do/think about this.

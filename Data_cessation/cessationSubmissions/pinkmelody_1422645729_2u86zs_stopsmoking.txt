Change of environment helped me quit.

I work about 70 miles from home.  My parents live in the city where I work and I sometimes stay with them when I don't want to drive home or the weather is bad.  This week, I stayed with them for the first time in a while and the change of environment helped me quit.  I didn't have as many of the usual habit triggers to deal with.  I'm not living with smokers at their house, spending time with them keeps me occupied, going shopping with my mom helps keep me distracted, and even going to bed early.  This is the toughest day so far since I've been home with two people who smoke in the house.  I haven't asked my SO or roommate to stop smoking inside yet- but I am simply avoiding them and going to do my own thing outside or upstairs.  Since I have a refuge during the week, I think I can manage avoiding the smoke on weekends.  I have also made it clear by saying things like "I can't hang out with you if you guys are smoking.  It makes me want to punch you.  I'm going to bed/upstairs/whatever."  I know my SO will be fine with me asking them to stop smoking inside- it's just that I've quit so many times before and always give in, so he's grown weary/tired of the rules changing for a few weeks every year at my whim.  That's why I'm going to give it a couple of weeks this time.  Anyway, my point is that a change of environment was extremely helpful for me.  If you can manage something similar, try it.  Maybe rid your home of ashtrays and other paraphernalia then go stay with a nonsmoker friend for a week, then when you return your habits already had help being established.  Just an idea that worked for me.

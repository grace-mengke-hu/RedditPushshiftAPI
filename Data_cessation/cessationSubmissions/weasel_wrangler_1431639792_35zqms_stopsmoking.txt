'Social' smoker for 15 years, never had a craving, only smoke when drinking. How to stop?

Hi all. I smoke about 15 cigarettes a week, but only smoke when I drink. I have a job that means I have to entertain clients a lot, which means I go to restaurants, bars, etc at least 4 nights out of 7 each week. I have never woken up and needed to smoke right away and never had a 'craving' for nicotine when sober. I really don't know what a nicotine craving feels like. I know it's stupid but there is very little info on this kind of smoking, the damage it does (obviously lots) or how to quit on the internet. Anyone had the same?

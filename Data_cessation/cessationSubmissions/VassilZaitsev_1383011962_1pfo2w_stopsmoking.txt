Hoping this is the right place to get some advice

So, I've been smoking for about 8 months now. During the summer I was up to almost a pack a day... really I stopped keeping track. Anyways, when I really tried stopping a few weeks ago it didn't seem that difficult (weirdly enough). I was able to get through the day relatively easily, and I felt as if I had a sense of control over it.

Anyways, the problem I have been having is that I seem to be fine just having 1 or 2 cigarettes a day, whether it be going to a friends or buying a pack just to give away the remaining 23..

I'm just having difficulty with the transition from literally having no more than a few a day to absolutely none. I usually will have one in the evening after work or something. 

Anyways, if you guys have any feedback, I'd love to hear from you guys, Reddit is an awesome community. Not sure if relevant, but I'm 18, and in College.

Frustrated

Hey, guys. I've made a few posts on here. I had gone 3 weeks without a cigarette and I slipped. Then I slipped again and here we are. I am so sick of failing. My whole life feels like a series of failures. I want to go 2018 completely smoke free. I'm planning on making a firm quit date 2 weeks before new years so I can feel great on January 1st. 

I just want to do this for myself and for my wife. She doesn't deserve a husband who keeps going back on his word. Just looking for some support, I guess.

Thanks for reading.

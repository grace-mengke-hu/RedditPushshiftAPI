Trying to quit but I keep messing up. I'm trying to find a good alternative

I've looked at e cigs but have read a ton of things half of which say they're okay but the other half say they're worse. Has anyone seen these cocoa nicotine free cigarettes? https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00TMC3JOG/ref=cm_sw_r_other_apa_sO7SxbEPTX1YA

I was just wondering if anyone here might have any insight on these or maybe better options because I'm desperate at this point.

Thanks for any help

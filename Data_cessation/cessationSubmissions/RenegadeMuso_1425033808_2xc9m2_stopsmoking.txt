Today I quit Nicotine....period.

I quit smoking on 26 January 2015. 20 a day smoker for 10 years, and finally quit. I tried quitting before, with a record of making it to day 4. Now, I made it to 32 days! I chewed Nicotine gum as an aid. 

In my first two weeks, I chewed 6-8 gums a day. Last week until now, I chewed around 3 max. 

Today, I finally made the decision to go ahead to quit Nicotine period. My last chew was yesterday. It is now lunch time as I write this, and I have not needed to chew yet. 

32 Days Smoke Free. Mark this as Day 1 Nicotine Free!

Big thanks to this community for the support.

I made it through finals.

Hello all. I quit in June and I feel pretty good. I also made it through an entire semester of school. I used to think that would be impossible, but it wasn't difficult at all.

I've been having seasonal triggers though. And they're really weird, for instance, last week I was narrowly avoiding stepping on some black ice and it got triggered. But in any case, I'm just powering through and learning winter without cigarettes.

This sub has been a great help. Whyquit.com also helped me a lot when I first quit. To anyone looking into quitting, keep looking into it because not being a smoker is awesome.

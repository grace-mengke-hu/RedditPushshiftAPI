First day, already caved

I made this big testimony to myself yesterday that I was finally going to quit. But this morning as I drank my coffee, the craving hit. I ignored it, tried to take my mind off it, but I got so irritable and anxious and couldn't think about anything else. So I caved and bought a pack after a few hours. I just wanted one, but now I have 19 just taunting me. I don't know how to do this, guys. I don't think I can. I'm terrified this is going to go on the rest of my life.

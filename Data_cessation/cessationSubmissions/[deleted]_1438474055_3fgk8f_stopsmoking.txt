I want to stop smoking, where do I start?

I'm 15 and have been smoking since I was 13 (Mom was a smoker, then she dated a drunk/smoker so I stole packs. Now my drug dealer buys them for me.). I really want to stop because I was born with slight asthma and I feel like it's returning slowly. I'm constantly out of breath but when I'm with my friends I just feel like having a smoke. Where should I start?

Quit and don't look back

Hey guys, checked my badge today and notice I have finally made it to 1 year. It's been a great year with no need to step outside in the heat for a smoke, or waking up early on the weekend because I need some nicotine. My lungs feel better, my cravings are getting less and less frequent. More money is in my pocket. 

The day I chose to quit smoking wasn't anything special. It was just another attempt out of the hundreds of times I tried to quit. Don't beat yourself up if you fail many times, because each time you try you're learning new things and at least giving it a shot. And you never know when one streak will finally stick. So just keep going no matter what the condition is.  

A small tip I would give you right now if you're in the middle of a quit is accept the pain. Pain is just a part of life, but misery is an option. When I quit, I welcomed the benefits of quitting, as well as accepted the pain that would come along with it. It made the process much easier. When I couldn't concentrate, I accepted it. When I couldn't sleep, I accepted it. When I was frustrated and craving, I accepted that too. It was okay, life will go on with or without me, no need to over think the pain. 

I know you can do it, don't give up. If you give it your absolute best every day, you'll look back one year from now and be exactly in my position.

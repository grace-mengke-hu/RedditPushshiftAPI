Does gum discoloration ever go away?

I’ve quit smoking for at least a few months now, and honestly my health is almost completely back to normal. I can breathe better, I can taste and smell, I can even run and exercise without feeling like I’m dying but one thing I’ve been noticing since I quit is that my gums are still a rather dirty dark color and don’t get me wrong they’ve improved but not nearly as much as everything else has. Even my teeth are white and shiny now. I know it’s not too big of a deal but will they ever go back to normal?

Keep on, keeping on

Multiple failed quit attempts over many years and finally I am free. 250 smoke free days and counting. I only come here occasionally to see what others are up to and as a reminder to hi five myself. The first 3 days sucked, but every day after that gets easier and easier. Once you hit 30 days you are gliding on air as long as you stick by the NOPE principle... not one puff ever. Hang in there and keep on, keeping on. We can all beat this eventually.

When do you think all 50 states will have a comprehensive smoking ban?

Most "experts" predicted by 2020, there wont be any states left where places like bars, restaurants and casinos are exempt. Most southern states still exempt bars. Theres a lot more smoke friendly states than I thought. Almost half the US still doesnt have a total ban. I think Nevada and a few southern states could last until 2030 or later before they have a total ban.

My last cigarette....

Alright here it goes, last cigarette (supposed to be anyway!) I downloaded the smoke free app, read "the easy way to stop smoking" already moved a weeks worth of cigarette money to my savings account, I'm ready to do this (I think....) The health benefits, the savings and my kids are my motivating factors! I've lost 30lbs (and still losing!) And I've found I'm able to do soooooo much more for myself and my family but this damn smoking is still slowing me down! So I'm done letting it hold me back, timeto break free! Wishme luck ðŸ˜•

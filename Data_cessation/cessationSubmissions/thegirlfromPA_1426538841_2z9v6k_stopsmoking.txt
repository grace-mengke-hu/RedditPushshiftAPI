Thinking of my friend...

I have this friend. He's 38 years old and already has COPD from his smoking. Since last Tuesday he has been in the hospital with pneumonia and has been on as much as 15 lpm of oxygen because his pulse ox has dipped into the middle 70s when he does something as strenuous as turning over in bed. Now he is battling pulmonary edema and today found out he is in congestive heart failure. He was smoking as much as 3 packs of hand rolled cigarettes everyday, knowing he has COPD. He's still so young, so much life ahead.... don't let his story be yours. He's seriously struggling right now and while he swears he's done with smoking forever, I worry he might not even make it to point of quitting. Today I am not smoking for him. Hoping that he gets better and that maybe, just maybe... I can help encourage him to really quit and know he isn't alone. I will not be him... and I hope all of you will learn from his tragic lesson. <3

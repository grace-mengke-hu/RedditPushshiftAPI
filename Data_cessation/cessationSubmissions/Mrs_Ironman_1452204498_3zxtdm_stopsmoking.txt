Ugh. Why......

Hi all. This is my first time here and my first time ever really trying out any kind of forum... 
I.. like most of you here am trying to quit this little sticks of  pure freakin happiness. Yep... ciggies. 
I quit smoking at 23:02 on the 3rd of Jan. Today is my 3rd day (4th at 11pm lol) 
I thought I was doing well. I've had like 9 pieces of 2mg nicorette gum in the whole time I've been stopped. However.. today and yesterday have been so tough. I've almost been crying with a want to smoke. Then my head is saying "I don't want to quit.. why the hell am I quitting?" 

I know this is just the chemical demon trying to convince me to have "just one" and ill be fine and won't ever smoke again... It's like I'm bloody fighting myself as well as losing my best friends who are always about in good times and bad. 
Anyone else had/having this problem? I really don't want to start again but it's getting harder and harder :(

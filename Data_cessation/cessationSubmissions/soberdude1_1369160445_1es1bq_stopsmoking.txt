6 Months Baby!!!

Never in my life would I have thought I'd be free of nicotine and cigarettes. Quit and failed 100's of times. Then I read Allan Carrs book "The Easy Way to Stop Smoking" He spoke the truth about smoking and nicotine addiction. So much so , that I quit like I turned off a switch. I just became a non-smoker. I smoked on average, 1.5 packs a day for 40 years. Had my last one on November 22, 2012. Never looked back. I see people here who are sturggling with withdrawal and cravings. With this book, I felt no cravings and no withdrawal, that I noticed. I was truely amazed. I recommend this book to any body who is serious about quitting. It was truely EASY this time. Quit on the truth or smoke for the rest of your life on a lie!

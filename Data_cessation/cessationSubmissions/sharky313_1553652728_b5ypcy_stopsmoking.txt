Hey guys, I intend to stop smoking

I'm a final year grad student. I decent at academics and have got a good job I look forward to after graduating. I used to play basketball but stopped roughly a year and half back, after my break up, once I started smoking. I am unable to moderate, so I think it's best if I quit altogether. Another point I'd like to share is that I used to have a very high libido but after a year of smoking I can see that it has gone down. Is this recoverable? Can anyone assure me if I'll go back to being the way I used to be before I started smoking? But regardless, I've concluded that it's time for me to quit, I don't want to carry on this nasty habit with me out of college. Thank you Reddit, you motivated me to take this call.

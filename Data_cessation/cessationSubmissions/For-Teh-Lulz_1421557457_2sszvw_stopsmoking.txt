A weight has been lifted !

3 Days since my last cigarette... I built it up in my head to be an impossible challenge, but I did it.  I didn't hide in my house and wait out the storm, either, which was my first instinct...

Feels like a huge weight has been lifted.  3 Days is the longest I've gone without smoking since I was 14 or 15. 29 now...  when I quit 3 days ago I cried quite a bit because of how much of my life I have given over to the power of nicotine addiction.  Today, I am smiling and so very grateful that I am getting out now...

One idea that I held onto in the past two months as I quit alcohol and now cigarettes is thinking about being diagnosed with emphazema or cirrosis of the liver.  If either of these happened to me, you are damn right I would quit... so if I would quit then, why not quit now?  I will quit now instead, and hope I never have to hear those words from a doctor.

Finding it still hard to concentrate my train of thought, but I can breathe so much easier as of 3 days complete.  Tomorrow morning is going to be amazing !

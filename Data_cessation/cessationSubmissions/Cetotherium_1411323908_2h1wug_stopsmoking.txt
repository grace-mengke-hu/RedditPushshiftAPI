45 hours...

Had my last cigarette Friday after work, around 3 or so. So far I'm doing better than I expected, but been eating lots of candy and juice and such. I am having trouble dealing with anxiety and anger, which isn't a huge deal at home, but I worry about work tomorrow. I'm new to both this job and the trade itself, and the last thing I need would be me lashing out at a co-worker or boss or screwing up because I couldn't focus due to cravings? I have issues focusing as it is.

When will the anger and the anxiety subside? I've been told 3 days but I don't know how accurate that is.

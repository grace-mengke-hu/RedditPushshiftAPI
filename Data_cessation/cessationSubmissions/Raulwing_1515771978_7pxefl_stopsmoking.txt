Quitting smoking right now. Wish me luck, and best of luck to you all. Id love to find an accountability partner.

Hi everyone,

I am 23 and have been smoking since i was 16. I had already quit for over a year but a severe case of heartbreak caused me to relapse and fall back into all of my terrible habits one year ago. Now i have been hitting the gym and smoking 20-40 cigs a day really interferes with that. My room stinks of smoke, my teeth are yellow, my breath is bad and i cant even sit still in uni for 2 hours without having to take a smoking break. Long story short, today is the day i quit. I am going to throw away my tobacco packs right now, get some nectarines and chewing gums and push through.

Id appreciate if anyone who is serious about this wants to be my accountability partner. Having one really helps. 

So, feel free to message me, wish me luck and good luck to all you quitters. It is definetly worth it!

A bad low

I am a week in after my last quit. I went for over half a year and then it got nice out. Kept restarting the last few months. I would only go a few days and then quit again. I never want to smoke again. I am just so emotional right now. It hurts. I love my husband, but he really is no help as he chews and that is okay. Urgh! He does not try to quit and does not know what I am dealing with. Just wanna cry...I am not okay...I feel alone and sad right now. Thanks for listening.

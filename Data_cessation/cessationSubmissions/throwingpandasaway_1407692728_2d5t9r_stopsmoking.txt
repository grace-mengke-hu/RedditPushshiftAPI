Day 1!

I've felt terrible the past year and a half. My SO thinks I quit that long ago and I feel terrible that I haven't really quit. I have my vape though, so I'm getting my nicotine without slowly killing myself. How long until the cravings for camels go away though? I actually enjoyed smoking and I really really want one right now...

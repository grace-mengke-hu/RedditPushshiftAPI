Ok I'll say it...It's not that hard.

I'm sure this opinion will be unpopular but I wish someone had told me before I quit. Maybe I would have tried sooner.

Quitting is not that hard. 

We all like to sit around and discuss how difficult the journey to quitting is, but what does that do? We pat ourselves on the back and feel good about the accomplishment but how does that help anyone else? People thinking about quitting listen to quitters lament about the struggles and woes of cravings and they think, "Well that sounds miserable. I don't want to do that at all."

I'm writing this to all of you that are thinking of quitting...not every experience is the frustrating anger filled climb that you usually hear about. I smoked a pack a day for 13 years. I can honestly say that it is possible to find joy in the process. Framing the experience properly in your mind can make it a breeze. On the list of struggles we go through in life, quitting is far from the top of mine. Maybe you'll have a similar journey. Give it a shot and find out.

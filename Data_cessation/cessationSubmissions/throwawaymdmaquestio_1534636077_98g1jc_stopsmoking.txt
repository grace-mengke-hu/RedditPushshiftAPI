How do you deal with cravings while drunk?

Ive managed to go 30 days without sm9king but have had really bad cravings now that I've had a few drink, I was wondering how you deal with them?

Also if you have a single cigarrete do you continue your counter or reset it? If you reset it then it feals lile youve achieved nothing and that makes me want to smoke and if I dont reset it its like its meaningless and I want to smoke. Just wondering what your opinions are.

Thanks in advance for any replys

Benefits of quitting thread!

I'm obsessed with googling the benefits of quitting smoking whenever I have an urge to light up, but I'm getting a bit tired of the standard "After 20 minutes, after 2 hours, after 3 days." My heart rate going down, etc, is not really the benefit I care about right now.

I thought we could all put a benefit we've noticed since quitting, and where we are in our quit. That way we all have something to look forward to.

Day 23: 

* Bags under my eyes are going away
* My hands have are now a normal colour and aren't as dry
* My nails are getting stronger
* I'm tasting food a lot more
* I've been out a few times and drank alcohol without wanting a cigarette
* I'm coughing a lot less when I wake up 
* A lot of the old stomach problems I had are going away
* Quitting related heartburn is becoming much more infrequent
* I don't stay awake at night worrying about when I'm going to quit smoking!

Your turn!

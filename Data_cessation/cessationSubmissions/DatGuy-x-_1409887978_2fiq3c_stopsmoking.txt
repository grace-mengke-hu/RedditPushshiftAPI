Here we go again for the last time

Hello all,

I recently found this subreddit because I recently quit. 

I'm 33 and have been smoking for 19 years. I have been planning this quit for about 5 months, read the Allen Carr book 3 times. 

I have quit before, the longest lasting about 4 months. I have tried all the nicotine supplements and nothing did it. 

its been 4 days now, and I must say that I feel great. I have been able to work through all cravings and keep a positive frame of mind.

I'm done with those things.

My wife told me she was proud of me!

She is still smoking, and not much has been said about what I'm doing since I started doing it.  I haven't been rubbing it in, or talking about how hard it's been, but, I've been quietly plugging away and, in turn, she has not smoked in front of me.  

Today, out of the blue, she told me over the phone she was proud of me.  It meant the world.

I plan not to talk much to her about it, though, until she shows some indication that she is willing to quit.  I know you can't make someone.  I'm just hoping that I will, eventually, be leading by example. 

Until then... here's to getting my sense of smell back today! (The shitty office coffee smelled like it came from a French Cafe, haha)

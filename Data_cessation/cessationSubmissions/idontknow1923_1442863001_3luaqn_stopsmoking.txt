insomnia

I still have insomnia after 42 days now- i have not had 1 peaceful night of sleep.  i went through a reduction program so the insomia started 2 days before i quit.  i've read it has nothing to do with nicotine since it's out of my system in 3 weeks, but i slept well before i quit so it has to be the cigs.  i consume no caffeine and eat very healthly as diet has a lot to do with sleeping.  i've tried melatonin, meditation, mediation cd, yoga, vigerous morning workouts- i've always been a smoking runner LOL, walking in evening.  i fall asleep fast but either wake up all night long and toss and turn or am wide awake for 2 hours between 2 and 4am.  i can't find any literature or books to help.  does anyone know how long this will last?  i'm on no gum, no vaping nothing, not even alcohol.  i've tried everything from this link - some of these comments say people have this for 3 years after that fact.  http://www.ask.quit-smoking-advisor.com/2012/01/24/ive-quit-why-cant-i-sleep/

Idea for quitting. Seems to work so far.

My Uncle made a suggestion to help me quit. When he had to quit he said the only thing that worked for him was to not tell anyone! So if someone asks to go outside for a cig - say you don't feel like one. If someone asks to bum a cig say you haven't got any. Its only day two but I feel good this time because usually when I quit I need to tell everyone that I am quitting, just become a non smoker!

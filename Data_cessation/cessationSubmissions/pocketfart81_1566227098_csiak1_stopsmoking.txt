Decided to quit

I have finally decided to put an end to this bad habit of mine. Today I smoked more than I usually do (I just smoke one, but today I did 2) and I feel really really not good. Like straight up not having a good time bro. I think I can go cold turkey because I don't smoke much, so stopping might be easier than it is. My girlfriend has no idea that I smoke and if she does she'll end up leaving me(we've had this conversation but I can't just stop)

So for my love and my health, I am quitting today.

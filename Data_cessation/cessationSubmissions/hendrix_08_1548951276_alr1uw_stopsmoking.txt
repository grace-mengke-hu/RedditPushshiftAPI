I'm ashamed of how many times I've pressed "Reset all data" in the SmokeFree app

I've been trying to quit for a couple of years… I've had numerous smoke-free weeks here and there, but I've relapsed…

I can't take it anymore. Hopefully, this is the last reset.

ps. Thank you all for your stories, they are really inspiring.

made it 1 month

I quit cold turkey after smoking for 15+ years. Hasn't been very difficult so far. What helped is that I have had a bit of a sore throat all month. There are claims that this is a side effect of quitting, but the explanation as to why doesn't make any sense to me.  
I'm a bit of an outliner on here because I don't hate smoking, and I haven't had any bad side effects yet. I also don't experience any of those "I can smell flowers for the first time!" moments.    

I've tried to quit once before and used nicotine gum and vapes. I can only recommend anyone to just go cold turkey. Everyone I know who switched to vaping, either also still smokes or goes back to smoking.  

What honestly makes me a bit anxious are the 3+ year updates. Are you really still thinking about smoking after 3 years? Maybe this will be more difficult than I think!

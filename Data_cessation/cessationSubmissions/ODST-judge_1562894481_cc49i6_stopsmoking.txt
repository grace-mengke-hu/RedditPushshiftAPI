Quit cold turkey 72 Hours ago, lost all ability to focus.

Hey everyone, I'm new to the community. Need some advice.  


Let me preface by saying that first, I have severe ADHD. I have tried to quit before, on that attempt I was 48 hours out and became severely nauseous and nearly bed ridden. I had doubted that it was completely on the fault of smoking, but after today, I feel like I understand what I'm really going to have to face to quit.   


Today I was in a great mood, I noticed I was a little spacey but it was nothing unusual. I got to work and started my job like normal. I've been replacing the cigarettes with coffee that I would drink throughout the day. So I poured my first cup of coffee and after my first break made another. An hour after my break I was moved into my main channel (I work as a customer service agent and am a Chat agent, I started the day on phones as we were backed up) I noticed pretty immediately that my attention span was severely decreased. My entire perspective felt very empty, and the best way to describe this feeling is - like an old tv with bunny ears that wasn't getting great signal. Everything was there but very fuzzy, I knew what was happening but just couldn't lock into the image. I left work after about 5 hours, when I explained the situation to my supervisor.  


I did some light reading when I got home and found a couple articles that I honestly couldn't say were reputable as I didn't look at sources. They said in general that people with ADHD (especially non medicated like myself) are 60% more likely to begin smoking to compensate for the lack of attention span, energy, and general focus.  


I slipped up and had a terrible craving and bought a pack. I'm disappointed in myself but I will be returning to the cold turkey run tomorrow.  
 

Has anyone else experienced this? How did you deal with it? Is it normal?

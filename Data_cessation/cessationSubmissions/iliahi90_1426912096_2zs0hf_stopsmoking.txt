Need Some Motivation

Hello,

I am new to this subreddit, so I apologize in advance if I may offend anyone. I am looking for some words of encouragement and also some motivation. My quit date is set for Monday the 23rd, and I have also signed up with the Quit Line in my state. The counselors have advised me to cut back before my quit date, however, I have been finding myself smoking more. My lungs hurt...With me smoking more, I feel like I won't be able to quit. I want to and I need to (I do not have anything medically wrong with me - but smoking ironically makes my anxiety worse). I feel like a terrible person and a terrible mother. And no, I absolutely do not smoke in front of my daughter. I almost want to wake up tomorrow and quit, yet I question whether or not I can follow through. Has any other smoker/ex smoker ever felt like this before quitting?

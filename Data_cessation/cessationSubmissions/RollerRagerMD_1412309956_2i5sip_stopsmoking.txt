Really vivid dreams after quitting? Usually not even dreams about smoking.

Who else has experienced vivid dreams after quitting? The first few days seemed business as usual, but in the past couple weeks I've found myself having vivid dreams almost every night. Maybe one nightmare, otherwise they're just really intense dreams that can linger in my memory for a few days after. I had one smoking related dream but that's about it.

Any theories on how this occurs? I know that folks who quit with the patch or Chantix often have vivid dreams since their bodies aren't used to having full doses of nicotine present during sleep (in the case of the patch).

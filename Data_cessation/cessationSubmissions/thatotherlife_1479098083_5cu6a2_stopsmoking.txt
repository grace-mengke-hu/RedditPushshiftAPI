This is scary ...

I just logged in here for some inspiration ... I was driving back from my first party of alcohol without cigs , it was a house party so as I was driving my mind was naturally looking forward to smoking a bunch of cigs after I got home only that I knew all along that I quit ! Every fucking turn was hard , everytime i saw a gas station I wanted to go buy a pack n worry about consequences tomorrow . I felt so so weak , mind you on a daily basis I don't even think about cigs nomore and I am doing so well . This was testing . So when I was finally turning into my apartment building the road was empty and I could either go left into my apartment complex or do a U-turn to the nearest gas station . I went into my community and I managed to get home and sit down . This demon has so much power over me, I am just stunned and scared now . I don't Know if I'll make the right choice every time but today I did .. long term quitters any advice or thoughts ?

I Just lost my job, and I have a date on Sunday

I've been procrastinating for far too long and I've decided today is the day. I've just finished my pack so I thought "why not make it the last one?"

I lost my job, so money will be tight. Why waste what could be a trip to the grocery store on cigarettes? I have a date with a girl I've been texting for the past 2 days and she doesn't smoke. The least I can do is not smell, so why not go to the root of the problem and quit smoking altogether?

I've tried before and I relapsed. This time I'm going cold turkey.

I'm bot a strong willed individual, so this is going to be a real challenge. Wish me luck!

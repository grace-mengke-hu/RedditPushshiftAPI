I have been able to cut cigarettes from my daily life. Going out is a different matter though.

After a lot of struggle I've been able to force myself to just NOT buy cigarettes whatever happens. This means that in my day to day activities I'm not smoking. However when I go out with friends, which happens twice a week, since they all smoke I can't resist asking for some as well.

I'd like to cut this last part from my life but this seems to be the hardest because it's when you're surrounded by people that smoke and slightly intoxicated from drinks that it's easiest to give in. 

Anyone that has had something similar? What have you done to help you take this last step?

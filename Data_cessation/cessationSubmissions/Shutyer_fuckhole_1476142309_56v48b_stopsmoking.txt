Lost count of the days since I quit!

Hi all! Just wanted to check in. Today i realized I hadn't been back to this sub in a while and didn't realize that I was already at 37 days!! I now feel like I go most of the day without thinking about nicotine and when I do it's fleeting and easily brushed off. This my 4th real attempt at quitting and is the furthest I've gotten. I know I've still got a journey ahead to stay smoke free but I'm feeling stronger everyday. Thanks again to this sub!

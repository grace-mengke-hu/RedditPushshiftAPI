I just made it 2 years without a single puff!

Smoked for 10 years, pack+ per day.  I quit 2 years ago using a vaporizer for a surgery.  Have not used the vape for 2 years now.

Summers are the most difficult for me: music festivals, rafting, BBQ's, etc.  But I did it!  

EDIT:  Thanks Everyone :)

This sub has helped me so much!  It's all about the badges, baby!

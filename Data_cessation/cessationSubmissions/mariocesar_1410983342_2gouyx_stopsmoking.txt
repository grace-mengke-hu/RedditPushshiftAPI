Need advice, I smoke to relax and I'm getting a hard time trying to quit

Hello all,

My smoke habit is very tied to stress, even if I get weeks or months without smoking I often find myself smoking again when I'm stress out or with anxiety.
 
I'm trying hard to stop, but it's just easier to me to come back. I'm fully aware I'm getting weaker and the guilt after smoking stress me more.

There is someone with the same problem? what can I do as an alternative for relaxing, maybe not relax, just go through the anxiety without smoking.

I had been tried to meditate, but it's not making it easier, and looks like my body is not ready for sports.

I worry myself to much, and I want to quit.

Any advices?

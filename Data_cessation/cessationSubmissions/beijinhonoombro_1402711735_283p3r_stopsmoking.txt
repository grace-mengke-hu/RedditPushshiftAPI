crazy dreams?

I could go into details but I don't think they're relevant; I quit cold turkey about four days ago and now I am having the craziest dreams. I mean I can actually remember them and I am having to wake up periodically for a reality check throughout the night. This morning I wasn't even sure if I knew what had been a dream and what actually happened... I have not been on anything else since I quit unless you would count morning coffee. Has anyone else experienced this after quitting?

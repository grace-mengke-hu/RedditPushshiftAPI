15 Days, Smoker's Flu

Fifteen Days smoke free, and good Lord if my body's not throwing everything out with the speed and vehemence of an ex-girlfriend clearing her apartment. 

Withdrawals gone! Now just feel like crud.

Throat hurts, but Dayquil should help. Can't wait for a continuous night's sleep. Oy.

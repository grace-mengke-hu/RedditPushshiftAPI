Reflections on the First Year

Tomorrow will mark an entire year since I smoked my last cigarette, ending a 12 year addiction which I tried to leave time after time only to return to it after a week, a month, three months- like an abusive lover I couldn't get enough of. But I did it, and I know I will never ever go back to it and my success hinges very much on this subreddit. I received so much support from this place, it kept me focused, guided and constantly reminded that I was not alone. Allen Carr's book and Champix were the methods I used.  I won't go over all the benefits, the struggles, the ups and downs of kicking the habit- we've all heard these over and over. I will say though, that I have never been happier or more proud of myself for taking control over my health and overcoming this shitty addiction that I never thought I could be rid of. To anyone just starting out or struggling- remember that you're worth so much more than sucking on the end of a tar filled stick. You can do this- you need to do this- just take it one day at a time. There's no greater feeling than being free of this crap. Thanks for helping me through guys.

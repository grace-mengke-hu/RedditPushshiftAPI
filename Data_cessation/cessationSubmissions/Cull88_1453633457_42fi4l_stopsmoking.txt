I got really, REALLY drunk...

And I didn't smoke!! Currently on day 8. Got very drunk last night and didn't smoke. To be honest, I kept telling myself "I'll have one in a minute" knowing full well I wouldn't, but it almost took the pressure off, because after a few minutes, cravings went away and I was good. Guys, don't also be afraid to LIE to the nicotine monster, he/she lied to you, do the same back.

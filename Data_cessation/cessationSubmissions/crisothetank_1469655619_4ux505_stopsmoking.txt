I need help to stop

Used to be a professional athlete and now I smoke. Every time I light one up I feel a pang of guilt and shame at what my younger-self would say if he could see me now. It's disgusting and I know it is, but I just can't stop. I've tried to quit a couple times, the longest I got was 4 days and I just felt shaky and awful, so I had *one* to help and before I knew it I was back at square one.

Well tonight I was out with mates and had a few, and on the way home I got so angry at myself that I threw my lighter as far as I could and ripped up my baccy pouch. I'll probably regret that tomorrow lunch time but I need to stop so bad, can anyone give me advice or something?

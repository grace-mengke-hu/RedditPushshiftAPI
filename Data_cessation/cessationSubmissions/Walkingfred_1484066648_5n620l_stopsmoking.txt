What has worked for me so far

I just realized that today marks 4 weeks since I've had a cigarette! More specifically and to my point is that at 9:00pm tonight it will have been 672 hours since I've had a cigarette. 

This has been the strongest quit I've had in years and I really think that tracking my progress in 12 hour increments instead of days really helped me believe in myself as well as keep myself accountable. 1 day is a long time without a cigarette at first, so when you have to wait 24 hours to pat yourself on the back it can be daunting. I think that's where I messed up previous attempts--not congratulating myself enough.

What non-smokers think of you (whether it is true or not).

1) You stink.
2) Your yellow fingers are disgusting.
3) Your yellow teeth are disgusting.
4) You are lacking intelligence to spend so much money on something which makes you die in a disgusting way.
5) You spend way too much time smoking at work and not doing enough work. 
6) You look weak when you can't go an hour without lighting up. It's pathetic.
7) Why even bring your addiction to work? I don't get to work and start jerking off every hour.
8) You leave your fags everywhere on display. Non-smokers do not want to be constantly reminded of your stupidity.
9) When you return from smoking, whether it has been a while already or not, you stink. Your breath has a foul stench. You do not know this as you have accustomed yourself to this already over time. 
10) Non-smokers probably think you are a waste of space on this planet.
11) Your skin ages very quickly. I am currently sitting next to a 28 year old who looks 38.
12) You are most likely to get some form of cancer and taxpayers will pay for your care.
13) So just to reiterate, you stink, you are lazy, you look ugly. And you are a burden to society.

Cue the backlash from blinded smokers. I have heard it all. Non-smokers have I forgotten anything?

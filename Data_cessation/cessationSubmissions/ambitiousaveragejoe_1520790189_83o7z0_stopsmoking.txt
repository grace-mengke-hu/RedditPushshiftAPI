30 mins in, i feel calmer than usual.

I think this is my 3 millionth attempt at quitting this shit stick. i started noticing unusual headaches that concentrate on the right side of my head. i freaked out thinking im on the verge of getting a stroke, stocked up some nico gum and patches from the pharmacy.
i hope i dont touch that shit for the rest of the year. Quit NOW

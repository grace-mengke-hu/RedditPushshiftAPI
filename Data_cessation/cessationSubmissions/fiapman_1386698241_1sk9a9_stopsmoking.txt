Thank you reddit and...

... the first 40 pages of *The easy way to quit smoking*. But in all honnesty, reading people here on reddit helped me BIG TIME stay away from my Marlboro light.

I also wanted to share a website I came across today, very well done and worth taking a Look, especially if you are considering quitting.  **http://tobaccobody.fi/**

DAY 3...About to loose my mind

was with a couple of friends as usual , they were smoking ( BIG time ) like we always do , and that made me kind of ( i know its stupid ) question my decision to stop.. so yeah it's a rough night, just wanted to let off some steam..

EDIT: thank you all for the kind words , this sub is a LIFE SAVER!!

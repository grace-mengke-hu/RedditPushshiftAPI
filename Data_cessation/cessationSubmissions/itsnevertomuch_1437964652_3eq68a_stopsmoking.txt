Haven't smoked since Friday night.

and I'm loving it. I'm probably not over the hard part yet, and have yet to go to work since I stopped. However, I know I can do it. I'm sure I can. I smoked a pack a day for almost 2 years straight. I recently stopped taking prescription painkillers as I found out they were causing an issue with my skin, making it very sensitive and I think since I was constantly on painkillers, smoking became what I did on them. Now that I've quit the percocet, I've had no desire to smoke. It's a beautiful life. You can quit too.

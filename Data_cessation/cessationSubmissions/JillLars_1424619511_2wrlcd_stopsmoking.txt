Officially nicotine free

So I'm rapidly approaching the 1 year mark.  I quit using an e-cig and it worked really well for me.  I gradually tapered down my nicotine usage and had been at the 4 mg mark for the last couple of months.

This last week, I got a bug that's been going around and was generally feeling like crap- which killed most of my desire to even use my e-cig.  Now that I'm feeling a little better, I decided to just kick the e-cig too.  It's been 3 days without using it at all (and for about 5 days before that, I only used it maybe once a day.)  

Yay for no nicotine and moving past both cigarettes and e-cigarettes once and for all!

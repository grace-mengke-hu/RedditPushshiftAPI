Has anybody else replaced smoking cigarettes with hard drug usage?

I felt terrible cravings after a trying 12 hour shift at my place of employment. I wanted something that would make me feel good. I used to light up when feeling down about myself but instead I walked for a couple of hours. When that didn't relieve the bad feelings, I replied to a personals ad on CraigsList inviting people to "continue the party". I kept my quit (15 days today!) but I tried blow for the first time ever. I couldn't bring myself to buy a pack but I could do the necessary mental gymnastics to justify meeting a total stranger and using with them. I've struggled with mental health issues in rhw past, and I'm scared that smoking cigarettes kept the edge off enough so that I could function. 

Maybe my issue is beyond the scope of this sibreddit, but is there anyone out there with advice? Words of encouragement? Commiseration?

2 Week Marker: Cravings Increasing?

Long time lurker - so first let me say "thank you" to you all for sharing your experiences and encouragement.

Tonight is my 2 week marker but my cravings are getting more intense as time goes on.  I keep reading that things get easier with each passing day, but I feel like it's the opposite for me.  my first week seems like a breeze compared to my second.  Any thoughts on why and how to lessen the blows?

6 months have passed since I stopped. Is it weird that it feels so easy?

Hi all,

I stopped smoking Sep 4th 2017, after little over 9 years of smoking approx 10 cigs a day. There have been periods when I smoked more(and of course a lot when going out). I never tried stopping before, but that day it just clicked, my spirit was determined apparently. 

I went through physical withdrawal but psychically, I was happy with what I was proving to myself, and didnt really feel a huge urge. I was most afraid of all the situations where I usually smoked but got through them and started thinking about it less and less. All the while, there are a lot of friends around me who still smoke - that actually  makes it more disgusting now when I see them.

In social situations I like to light up a nice cigar which is a completely  different concept for me, since it takes longer, I dont inhale it, its very contemplative etc. I even smoke weed on occasion(I was afraid that might be a huge trigger, but again, no). 

My question is, has this “surrogate”-cigar been so helpful that I’ve managed to forget all that used to make cigarettes appealing to me? Right now I’m still disgustes by the smell, it smells kinda “chemical” and harsh. When I think about it, I think it shouldn’t have been this “easy”.

[Day 2] Morning cough is not as bad as it used to

I [quit smoking on a whim yesterday morning](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/2q7dhz/day_1_this_is_why_i_want_to_quit_smoking/), had my last smoke about 36 hours ago. Here's the effects I've noticed so far and some of the things I've done to help me cope:

* Already my morning cough has greatly subsided!
* This might just be my brain playing tricks on me, but my hands and feet used to always feel cold, now they don't, they feel at "normal" temperature, even kind of warm. I suspect that it's too early for the effects of smoking on the circulatory system to already have started to subside.
* I'm greatly irritable and I get upset much faster than usual, about stupid shit.
* I was feeling much anxiety yesterday but my SO has kindly shared some of her anxiety pills with me so it keeps me from getting too stressed out. (Not recommended I guess).
* I drink more coffee than usual, I know that I'm compensating :)
* I eat more than usual.
* I've been drinking more water than normal and have been eating some pitted jarred prunes to try to mitigate the risk of constipation.

Ok I'll update in a few days I guess.

Day 14

I love not smoking as much as I hated myself *for* smoking. It is so nice to not sneak off, hide or buy another pack all the while knowing better. Of course, I wish I had learned this sooner but man, am I glad I did not wait another day (which would have meant another year or even decade).

Carpe Diem!

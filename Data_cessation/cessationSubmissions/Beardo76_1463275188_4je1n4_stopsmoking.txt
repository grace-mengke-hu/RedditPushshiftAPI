Thinking of quitting due to smoking and Percocet mix

Hey everyone,
So...I've been intending to quit smoking for a few weeks now, but thanks to an unexpected abscess drain yesterday, I'm feeling a bit more motivated. 

I was prescribed Percocet for pain management after the abscess drain & now every time I have a smoke I start feeling nauseous. So I've been thinking about switching to the gum to jumpstart quitting cigarettes. My question is pretty specific though: has anyone used the gum along with Percocet, and if so, was nausea still a side effect? Should I even bother with the gum? Should I just go cold turkey? Any insight/help would be appreciated. Thanks!

Almost at 6 weeks, feel like a million bucks

This was my 6th attempt ever to quit smoking, and unlike the last few times, I really feel like this one has stuck. Previously all I ever did was attempt to quit, without making a positive change in my life to replace the addiction.

Things I did differently this time:

1. I used nicotine gum instead of an e-cig or vaping. A huge component of the addiction is the physical aspect involved with it; namely, the action of inhaling vapor though a tube held to the mouth. I found that switching to nicotine gum helped curb that aspect and further help me distance myself from the smoking habit.

2. Exercise. It's so often repeated because it's absolutely true. After quitting, I waited one week for the short term health improvements to kick in (restored heart rate, improved energy levels, etc.). After that I started the C25K running program (check out /r/c25k) and I'm on week 5 right now. 6 weeks ago I could barely walk up a flight of stairs without being winded. Now I can run for 15 minutes straight without too much trouble.

I've never felt better, and my health is improving so quickly it's ridiculous. I finally remember what it's like to take a deep breath and actually feel *full* of air, and I have so much more energy and a better appetite now.

Had a dream that a coworker got cancer from smoking.

I dreamt last night that a coworker got cancer from smoking.

When I woke up this morning and eventually remembered my dream, I realized that coworker doesn't smoke, but there was a time we met when I was smoking in front of him!

Maybe this is a sign....! :-)

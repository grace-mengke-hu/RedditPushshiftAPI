Day 4....aaarrrggghhhh!!

Today has been bad. Yesterday I didn't have any thoughts and felt good. Today I have a weight on my chest and all I can think about is a cigarette. Please tell me that these symptoms will be done soon!! Because I don't think that I can go through more days like this one.

All I can think about is a cigarette and how nice the smoke would feel on my throat. How one little puff could take away all this craving. 

I keep telling myself that I need to do this to reach my goal and everyone in my life be so proud of me....and part of me doesn't fucking care and wants to be locked up in a room somewhere and smoke my brains out lol.

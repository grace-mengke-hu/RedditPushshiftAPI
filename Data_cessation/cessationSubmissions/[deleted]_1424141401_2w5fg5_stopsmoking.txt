Anxiety and Heart Palpation's? Is a sleeping aid a bad idea?

So, I suffer from some bad Anxiety, and when I am trying to sleep and go to bed in the past while going through a quit, my heart papaltionas were really bad. I tried the Nicotine gum for awhile, but I just felt myself getting addicted to that, and in a way it's more expensive than actually buying cigarettes. 


Did anyone else suffer through Heart Papaltations at night? or just general sleep issues. i have been thinking about trying Melatonin for the first week or two, anyone have any advice on this?

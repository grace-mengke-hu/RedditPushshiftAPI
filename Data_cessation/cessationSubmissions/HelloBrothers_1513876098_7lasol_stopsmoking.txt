100 Days Nicotine Free!

100 days ago I was behind the dumpster at work smoking a cigarette. Something clicked, I was having a rough day beating myself up over little things and I screamed in my head, "and it doesn't help that you're running outside every 45min to speed-smoke a cig."
I stomped out my half finished cigarette, hurried inside and snapped the rest of my pack in half and emphatically threw it away. 

I just stopped buying packs. It seems silly, but this was the mental breakthrough I needed. I don't have to buy them anymore. I won't buy them anymore. 

The first two weeks are the hardest for sure. I was very irritable and the cravings were intense. Every time I had a craving I would drink a large glass of water and chew some gum or sunflower seeds. After the 3rd week I stopped counting days. Quitting was no longer a "thing" I was doing, I was now a nonsmoker. I only realized how long it had been a few days ago when I came by to this sub and saw my flair at 95 days! 

You wouldn't be at this subreddit if you weren't already thinking about quitting. Skip that routine trip to the gas station today. If you're going to quit it has to start somewhere. Might as well be today!

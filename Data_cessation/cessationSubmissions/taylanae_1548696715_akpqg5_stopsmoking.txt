I am 8 days in without smoking a cigarette. 4mg nicotine lozenges when I trip out. How people do this cold turkey i have no idea.

While I pop lozenge &amp; get through cravings.. I honestly miss smoking. Like inhaling and exhaling smoke. I wish they didn't smell so bad. One thing that's kept me going is when I am next to someone who just smoked and I'm like, Goddamn... lol now I know why nonsmokers are so dramatic and whiney about being around someone who smokes cigarettes etc. My boyfriend also quit for a couple of weeks and was my inspiration. But he's been smoking again!!! And he is a cigar guy so to me he cheated lol. 

It is not easy. I am a raging asshole and very easily irritated. I have anxiety and emotions all over the place. I want one so bad but I know I won't stop with one. *cries. 

Today has been extra difficult and it's 9:30am lol. 
Pray for me. Xoxo

This is the day.

Hello everyone. Normally, I wouldn't post anything on the internet regarding something personal, however.. today I feel strong. It is my birthday today, and impulsively I feel that the best gift I can give myself is to quit the ugly nicotine addiction I have for over 8 years. I have tried to stop several times, but never was really able to convince myself that I would be strong enough to quit. Those times I quit for a period of time, I started smoking pot with tobacco, feeding my need for nictotine but thinking it was legit because they were no cigarettes. Today I will not lie to myself anymore. Smoking is nothing but a filthy addiction, which we are able to escape. Today I quit for good. Thank you.

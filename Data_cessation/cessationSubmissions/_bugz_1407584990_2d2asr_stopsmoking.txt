Day 5 of 2 pack a day guy..

So I smoked for about 20 years, and most of the time around 2 packs a day. I'm 35, have two amazing kids and a wife in my life. While on a vacation in Florida I had a mini stroke. Doctors seem to think it was due to high blood pressure I'm on meds for it now though. It scared the living crap outta me. When I got home, I went to my regular doc and he had been hounding me about trying some tobacco cessation drugs, I gave in. I'm on chantix along with welbutrin. So far no crazy dreams like people reported, no side effects at all really. 

I feel amazing to be honest. I only feel the need to smoke a cig when  I smoke cannabis, and it goes away quickly. I don't really have a reason to post other than feeling good about my 4 days off tobacco. Not even ecigs, or vapes. I chose to go off nicotine completely. If you're having trouble with cravings, look into chantix and wellbutrin. There is a few articles floating around that I looked into.

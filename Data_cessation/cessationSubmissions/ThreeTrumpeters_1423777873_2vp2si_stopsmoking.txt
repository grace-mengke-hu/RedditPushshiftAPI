It's time for a change.

I'm tired of scheduling my life around when I can smoke. 
I'm tired of being tired without them. 
I'm tired my teeth being destroyed. 
I'm tired of smelling like smoke. 
I'm tired of this and I'm done with it. 
Wish me luck, I know I can do this. Today starts my new life of not smoking, no matter how hard it may be.

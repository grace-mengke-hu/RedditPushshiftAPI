Feeling Great!

5 Days Down and I'm headed out backpacking for a few days, kinda will feel like cheating because my cravings are always mild when I have no opportunities, but hey, I'll take it. Maybe I can do this after all. I am a little bit worried about my euphoria letting down when I get back. I quit just so I could take this trip, but I really want it to be a forever thing. I appreciate all the prayers or happy thoughts that seem to emanate from this sub. Have a great life!

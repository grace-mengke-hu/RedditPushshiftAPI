Today's my last day as a smoker

I had two years under my belt, and then I slipped up. Now it's been two weeks and I've been smoking a pack a day. My goal is to wake up tomorrow a non-smoker. I'm re-reading Allen Carr's book. But to be honest, I'm afraid. 

I feel like I enjoy smoking. I fear that his method isn't scientific and just basically self-help feel goods. He got me to quit for two years last time, but right now I'm full of fear. I've been miserable sometimes these last two years and pined for a smoke. I was usually fine, but I can imagine so many situations that smoking would seem to improve. Anyway, I still like the book and will finish it, but am hoping I can get some tips or responses to my worries. 

Thanks!

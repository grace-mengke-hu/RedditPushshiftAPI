The silliest reason I ever heard a smoker give for continuing to smoke.

A couple nights ago my sister had a friend over.  At one point the topic of cigarettes came up and she said she won't quit smoking because everyone she knows who did later died of cancer.  

I would've given creedence to her view on smoking, if not for her history of fibbing.  When I first met her a few years ago she told us about her friend who [brought home a most unusual stray dog](http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/dogs/a/mexican_pet.htm) so I'm not sure what to think.   

But then again, nicotine addiction is a powerful thing.  I suppose it's normal for smokers to grasp for reasons to justify smoking.  It's just that being on the other end, I find it silly what people come up with sometimes.

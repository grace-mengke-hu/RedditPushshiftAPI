Nicotine tapering guide that worked for me. The withdrawals were easy.

I'm in my fourth day with no tobacco/nicotine now, which is pretty remarkable for me, since the best that I've done in the past is about five hours. I used a tapering method that made the withdrawals pretty damn easy to get through. It was a little bit worse that caffeine withdrawals for me. Quitting cold turkey made me feel like I was going insane because I would have panic attacks and pretty severe depression. With this tapering method, I only felt cravings, and have had one night so far of insomnia which I fixed by taking L-Theanine. I feel a responsibility to share my process to quit, because it has tremendously helped me.

First I switched to vaping. I bought a decent setup. A Koopor 200w plus mod, a smok TFv12 tank, 2 18650 batteries, and a universal battery charger. This setup ran me about $110. I vaped for about a year before I decided that I wanted to quit. The first major step for me was getting off of everything in tobacco except for nicotine. There will be slight withdrawals from the other crap in the cigarettes. Don't go back though. Keep vaping until you have leveled out. This process takes about a month. I'd recommend going with 6mg/ml nicotine concentration in your juice. My reasoning is is that with my setup, this will be stronger than a cigarette and will make you want to vape more than smoke. 

The next step is learning how to make your own vape juice. It's pretty easy, and will save you a TON of money in the long run. You will need:

*Propylene glycol
*Vegetable glycerin (Food grade)
*Nicotine concentrate
*Volumetric measuring equipment(I would recommend 10ml syringes and a 20ml graduated cylinder)
*Flavoring (optional)

With these ingredients, you can make 30ml of vape juice (about 2 weeks worth) for about $2.50. After you've gathered all of your e-juice ingredients, find a good online calculator for making e-juice. I like [this one.](http://www.steam-engine.org/juice.html) Once you have calculated everything, mix the juice together and shake vigorously for about a minute. You can find a ton of info in /r/DIY_eJuice/

The key here is to go down by 25% every 5 days. So say you are on 6mg/ml of nicotine to start. You would then go down to 4.5mg/ml the next week, then 3.4mg/ml, etc. If you feel like you canâ€™t handle going down at that pace, you can simply go slower, or keep the same concentration for longer until you feel comfortable dropping. You also have to keep all other factor that effect your dose steady. I would set a stopwatch and wouldn't allow myself to go out unless it had been an hour since the last time that I vaped. I also took 6 puffs each session. If you don't do this, you will compensate for the drop by simply vaping more.

I quit at 0.7mg/ml. 

Hopefully this guide can someone out there quit. Best of luck to you all!

A little help to get started

So I'm ready to do this. I'm gonna buy the Alan carr book and get an app, just hoping y'all can provide some pointers.

Main thing is the app, I can't seem to find the smoke free app on the play store, is it an apple only program? If so, what app are you guys using on android?

The book, I noticed there is a revised version, wondering if I should grab that one instead of the original. Though I doubt there is much difference, and I'm sure they're equally effective, I thought I'd ask anyway.

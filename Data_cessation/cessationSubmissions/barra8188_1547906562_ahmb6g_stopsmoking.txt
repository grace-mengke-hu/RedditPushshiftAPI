Advice please

I'm on day 9 of not smoking, well late last night I had 1 or 2 cigs while drinking as I had told my partner I had lost his baby was early on but because he doesnt want more children it made it hard for me to tell him and couse I couldnt tell him I couldnt talk to anyone else so I had dealt with it myself I dont think he believes me although not something I'd lie about considering I hate liars, anyway I just wanted some advice as I dont know if I have to start from day 1 again :( or do I continue on thanks

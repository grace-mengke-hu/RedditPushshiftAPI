Trying to get past 1 day

I’ve been a smoker for around 15 years give or take and it’s time for me to finally stop(forever) I tried last night after reading a book to stop smoking, but after work around 9 pm when I got home I really really wanted to smoke which was about 22 hours from my last cigarette since I didn’t smoke all day at work. Now I am about 13 hours non smoking and will be 22ish again once I get off of work. How do I deal with not smoking when I get home?! I really want to stop so I’ll be checking in this subreddit often for some advice, thanks!

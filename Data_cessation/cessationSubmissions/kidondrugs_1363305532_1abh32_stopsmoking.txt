A (not so) small victory.

Just wanted to throw some positive energy toward my fellow quitters. Yesterday was day three for me, what I've learned from this sub is commonly thought of as the most trying. Not only did I go all day without* a smoke, 1) I had two long drives, 2) I was with a heavy smoker friend of mine all day, and 3) I had a couple of beers. This combination should have spelled disaster, I thought. But when that craving came, I remained steadfast. After what seemed like an eternity - narrated by my troubled inner monologue somehow repeatedly denying the urge - the craving dissipated. I don't know what it was, but something about winning that battle seemed to elevate me for the rest of the day. Every time the urge popped up, I roundhouse kicked that shit out of my brain in an instant, until they stopped altogether. I've never felt so victorious in my life.

What I mean to say by all of this is, in case anyone out there is facing doubts, or feeling as though they might lack the moxie to see this thing through, if I survived yesterday, I truly believe you can survive any day. Just believe in yourself, even if only for today, and soon it will get easier.
Good luck, folks, and stay strong.

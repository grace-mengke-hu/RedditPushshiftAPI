17 years old and can't quit.

I've been trying forever now to quit. I've been smoking for 2 years now and I can feel the smoke absolutely destroying my lungs and hurting my capacity for sports as well taking up an insane amount of time that could be spent studying/sleeping. 

The problem I have is my constantly being surrounded by cigarettes. Everyone in my family smokes and whenever I have the urge a pack is  always less than a yard away. 

Quitting cold turkey always seems to end up with me smoking more and not less than before I tried to quit. I need tips/advice/motivation from anyone else who's surrounded by the same temptation. 

Thank you.

Has Glaxosmithkline stopped producing nicabate minis?

I've quit smoking and can't buy the nicabate minis anywhere? Their website is still spruiking them but they are nowhere to be found. Are these bastards trying to move the remaining stock and not tell their dependant customers that their stop smoking aid has been discontinued?

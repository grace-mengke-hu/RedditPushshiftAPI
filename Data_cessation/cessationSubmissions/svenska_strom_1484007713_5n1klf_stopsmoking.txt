Common Recurrent Dreams/Nightmares While Quitting

Have you guys had recurrent dreams/a repeating "theme" in dreams/nightmares while you struggle with withdrawal/quitting? 

I have this dream, or a theme, of me trying to drive up a really steep slope (almost vertical), and when I'm almost at the top, I don't have enough power to go over the hump (I'm going very slow at this point, momentum having died)/lose to gravity and start to fall backwards. I am all, "oh shit, oh shit" in that dream. I think I've had similar dreams before. Some dream website said falling backwards means "you prevented yourself from making a bad decision or mistake. It may also mean that you are not ready to move forward and need to take a step back."

I'm probably forcing a meaning on my dream to fit what's going on with me right now, but I cannot help but wonder if there is a common theme of dreams among people who are going through withdrawal of varying degrees and/or from different substances. 

I'm not on any cessation meds.

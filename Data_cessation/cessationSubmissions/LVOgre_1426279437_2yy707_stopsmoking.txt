I'm not going away

I've never flooded this sub with anything. Every single response has been thoughtful and accurate.

Yet, I am only allowed to submit a single response once every 10 minutes. The only reason for this is that I had an unpopular opinion about the abuse and bad advice that was harbored toward NRT quitters prior to me calling people out for it.

That's not moderation. That's a personal vendetta.

I'm not going anywhere. I'll wait 10 minutes to post my replies because I think what I've added here encourages people, and I think that's important. I want every smoker in the world to quit, and if I have to take an hour to post 6 replies, I'll do that.

That said. I'd appreciate if someone would undo this. It's inappropriate, and it's just another example of the problem I was addressing when it was done.

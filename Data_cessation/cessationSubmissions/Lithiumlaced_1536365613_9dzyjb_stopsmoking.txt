I just ran and my lungs are angry at me

I just went to the gym for a treadmill walk since I'm obese and trying to get in more steps (to start with, I've been very sendentary for a while). Thing is I love running. And I got really into it. So I started running. I started to struggle to breathe and my lungs ached so I went back down to a walk. Im a slave to this addiction, but feeling negative consequences has really hit me. I am lucky to have no smoking related illnesses yet, so I'm hoping my love for running will help me kick this so I can run more and breathe easier

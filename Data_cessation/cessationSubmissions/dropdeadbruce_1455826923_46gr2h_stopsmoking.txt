7th day need help

So I am on day 7 and have been feeling awful, I slipped up and hit a smoke twice. I don't know if its all in my head but I have awful anxiety since I quit and I already have a long history of panic attacks. How much longer will it take before I start to actually feel less anxious or is this all just in my head? I just need motivation to realize this will pass.

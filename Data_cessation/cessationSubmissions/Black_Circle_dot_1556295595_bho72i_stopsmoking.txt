Day 4

So I am on day 4 without cigarettes but I am substituting it with a vape so I haven't started nicotine withdrawal yet. Part of me feels like this is cheating but I think it is a good start and stepping stone yet I feel guilty about it. 
How does everyone here feel about using a vape as a well to get off of tobacco too start?

Congrats to all the resolutioners out there!

I'm not sure if it's been for 5 years now since quitting was my New year's resolution. (Just the fact that I don't know how many years it is is amazing). I used to think about smoking every hour every day and now I barely think of it at all. The first few days or horrific and the weeks after that we're hard but everyday got easier until the point where I lost count. Congrats to all the people that have made it since last year or before!

To anyone that made it their resolution this year, you can do it! We are all here to support you!

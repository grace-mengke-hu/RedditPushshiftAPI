100+ days

Hi guys! Wanted to start by saying congrats on all your quitting victories, and good luck with your struggles! :) 

I've been quit for 105 days, and am still surprised the number of times I have to turn down cigarettes. Turn down myself, when I think "I could just ask coworker for one, just one, just this once" or "I should just stop and pick up a pack, today was that bad" or "it's been 104 days and I've been drinking, what's the harm?" Followed my friends outside for a smoke last night, thinking this to myself. And then I turned down a cigarette, turned down a drag, and celebrated another victory.

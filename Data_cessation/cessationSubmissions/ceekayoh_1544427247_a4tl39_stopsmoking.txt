I asked for a cigarette tonight

I have been puff free for four days now, the cravings are hard to ignore. 
My husband is supportive of me but he still smokes. 
Tonight we went out for dinner and drinks and on the way home he asked me if he could light one up. 
Me being on four days and thinking i could handle it, i said sure.
After smelling the first couple of puffs, i asked for one.
He refused to give me one and tossed his out. 
I started to beg for just one puff but he did not budge. 
I logged my craving down and chewed some gum and that seemed to help. 

I’m scared for the moment i am with other friends and they do give me one. 
Almost everyone i know smokes and it’s hard to avoid. 

Any tips on how to stay strong?  Especially when it’s always around me?

Today is my six months! Ten more things I've learned.

I did one of these four months ago, but this is a big milestone for me so I figured I'd do another one! Sorry for the wall of text!

1) I still get little tinges of cravings, especially when I'm stressed out. I find I talk more about my feelings, which was very difficult before I quit. I also find that I address issues at the appropriate time. I handle stressful situations better now rather than keeping it all pent up inside, stewing it over with a cigarette. People understand when you're acting stressed *in a stressful situation* -- it's a normal reaction.

2) I have switched my food munching with jogging. I initially replaced smoking with food, but that's all turned around. I'm going to try and run a 5K this winter. I'm well on my way to becoming healthier in a well-rounded way. I don't gasp for air when I run!

3) After nine years of smoking cigarettes, actually quitting and staying quit have been incredibly empowering. **I now want to try.** Before I quit smoking, I said things like, "I'd like to do that someday." Now I make plans to actually do it and know that when I put my mind and willpower to something, I actually come through.

4) I can go into bars that allow smoking and realize how much I *do not want* to smoke. It doesn't trigger me at all. It smells awful. I don't ever want to smell like that ever again. I always have to immediately come home and throw clothes in the washer. I never thought I'd get to this point.

5) This summer hasn't been that hot for me, even though it's been crazy hot and humid outside -- because I've only had to go outside to get into my car! I enjoy outdoor activities, but I don't have to take outside breaks at work or in the middle of a project indoors because I have to accommodate a smoking habit. I can enjoy my air conditioning in my car and it won't get sucked out of the crack in the window!

6) I like to sing and, while I'm definitely not a professional by any means, I find myself being able to sing for longer and without wheezing.

7) I was at a dinner gathering with a bunch of friends and a smoke break occurred. An attractive acquaintance and I were left behind (in the air conditioning, too). Turns out we were both "quitters" and we struck up an awesome conversation! Those dating prospects I talked about four months ago? It opens wider every day with the amount of people I meet. Smoking is a no-nonsense deal breaker for a lot of people.

8) Smoking is no longer cool. I've noticed more and more of my friends setting quit dates or declaring their want to quit.

9) My nails aren't yellow anymore! Along with smoking, I was biting my nails, so I never saw how my smoking was keeping them yellow. Now that I've quit smoking AND biting my nails, I see a huge difference in my nail bed! I'm not a nervous wreck anymore.

10) I've saved over $1000 so far, been able to have an awesome summer, and I'm moving into my first apartment with no roommates. All of this has been a rippling effect from my quitting.

Bonus) **I feel healthier.** I smell better. I look better. I work better. I socialize better. I don't have to worry about me "tasting like an ashtray" if someone kisses me. I feel better about my future and my life.

If you just threw out your pack today, or you've been quit for a while, keep it up! You can do it!

Picking a date to stop smoking. Serious replies appreciated.

I am working on picking a date, gathering helpful information, tips, and tricks to quit smoking.  I have attempted a few times in the past and have failed for various reasons.  I am 25 so I feel the need to quit while I am still "young" to avoid further risk of complications down the road as well as overall better my life health-wise and financially.  I have been in what I like to call a "rut" in my life and am beginning to get out of that rut.  So now that I have some self motivation I have come to the conclusion I need to make some decisions to better my life, starting with quitting smoking.  So my question is, how did you do it? How did you pick a date? Did you plan ahead to quit or just wake up a random morning and just decided to quit.  Any helpful information is appreciated.  Or just some good jokes are fine too! If you plan on being a dick please take that shit elsewhere.

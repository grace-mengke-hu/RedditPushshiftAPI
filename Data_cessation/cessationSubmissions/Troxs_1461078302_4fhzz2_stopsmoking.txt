Today, I must quit finally

Well, I'm sure most have been in my shoes at some point or another -- that desire to quit, but lost at how. It is infuriating being that every second spent thinking about quitting leads to thinking more about the feel of the next drag. 

Yesterday I found out that my wife is pregnant for a baby boy, my first child of my own. I've been the father to her daughter since she was one, so technically it is our second child. The news was fantastic, because now the household will become a two versus two rather than a three versus one stamped. This new also led to a little celebration. We cooked a wonderful meal, and drank wine with a friend. She, of course having only the 6 oz allowed and her first ever sip of wine since we found out we were pregnant, and I proceeded to finish the bottle with a beer to chase it. (I used to drink quite heavily before the pregnancy and chose to quit, for the most part, since she cannot drink). I also had a cigar with my pal to celebrate, and a couple a cigarettes to boot. 

Now, this morning, I have a massive hangover and all I can do is think about how great a smoke would be, but as I've always known cigarettes tend to make a hang over worse. I've been thinking about this craving for the past 3 hours (I know not that long), and slowly breaking down -- this is why I am here to write instead of going for a smoke. 

Anyway, what do other find themselves doing to get their mind away from that tickle in the throat and desire to fire one up? Any help/advise is greatly appreciated, as I have failed at quitting roughly 4 times now.

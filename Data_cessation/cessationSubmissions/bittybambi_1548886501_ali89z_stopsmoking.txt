I quit cold turkey 4 days ago. It has been challenging but I am committed to not having even a single puff. I‚Äôm sharing a couple of things that are helping me.

First, I am not drinking alcohol at all (no brainer right). Also, with the $6/day I was spending on cigs, I go to the grocery and pick out $6 worth of super healthy snacks that will not promote weight gain. I use these foods when I feel a challenge coming on but also just as a way to treat my body right. I am literally up to my ears in healthy snacks and it has gone a long way to show me how much I was literally burning up when I could have been investing in my health instead. 
Somethings that are helping me: shelled sunflower seeds, craisins, cucumber slices with fresh lime juice and cayenne pepper, freshly made salsa, guacamole, bananas, strawberries, tangerines, fresh pineapple, Greek yogurt, sweet potatoes (cube then steam 10 mins), different hot teas with grated ginger and lemon. 

Also, there is a list of the top 100 worlds healthiest foods with both a summarized and exhaustive scientific explanation at a website called worlds healthiest foods. When I am feeling particularly challenged, I reference the foods I am eating on the list and it helps to occupy my mind with something positive I am doing- this getting my mind off the trigger. For now I am making daily supermarket trips because it helps to occupy my time also. 

Also make sure you tell plenty of people who will help hold you accountable! Good luck everyone! We got this! ‚ù§Ô∏èü§ü

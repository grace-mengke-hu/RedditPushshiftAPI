Starting today..Wish me luck

I've been a on and off smoker for the past 4 years. Due to certain bad times in my recent life, I've gotten back to cigarettes and am at 10 cigarettes/ day.

Today I've decided to stop it, just like that. But I'm taking the help of Nicotine gums. I know cold turkey is the better way, but I've failed once trying that.

I'm planning to quit nicotine gums in 8 weeks time(as prescribed ).

Just wish me luck :)

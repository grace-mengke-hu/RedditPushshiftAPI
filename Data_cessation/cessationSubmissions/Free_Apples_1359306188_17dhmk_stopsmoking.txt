Woke up this morning and my throat is kind of hurting? Also, headaches and congested.

I think I might actually be having a harder time breathing right now.

Last cigarette would have been three days ago. The weird thing about right now is that after all of the intense cravings yesterday, I haven't experienced one today (yet). Also, I've been drinking water like crazy.

Anyway, what's up with my throat? Anyone experience something similar?

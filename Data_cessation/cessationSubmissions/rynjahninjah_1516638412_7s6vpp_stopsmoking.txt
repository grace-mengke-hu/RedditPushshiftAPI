191 Days, but I'm still not confident

I honestly thought that seeing all my old mates for the christmas and nye holiday period was going to be the toughest because they smoke like chimneys, but it was really easy. In fact I hated the smell of smoke.

It's been a little bit over 6 months since I've quit smoking and I barely drink alcohol now, which i'm very proud of considering I used it as a substitute for the initial few weeks I quit smoking.

But recently I've been going through a tough patch and being in a country where I don't know too many people, made me realise that smoking in this country made socialising a lot easier and not only that but I miss the alone time I had where I could vent and have a cigarette and allow myself to have a peace of mind.

I know starting again is ridiculous having made it this far and I really don't want to start, but all these thoughts and environment i'm in are making me think twice.

If any of you have experienced this and overcome a situation similar to this I could really use some advice.

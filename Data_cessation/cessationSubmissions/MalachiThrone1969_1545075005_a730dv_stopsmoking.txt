Any tips?

 So I've almost finished Alan Carr's book and I've set my quit date for this Friday. I still have alot of fear and apprehension about quitting though. Its not my first time trying to quit, but I do feel like "its time". Any tips or suggestions on how to mentally prepare for this? How to get the proper mindset? This sub is terrific by the way. Any help appreciated! Thanks

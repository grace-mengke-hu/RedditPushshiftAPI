When did your physical cravings end?

Hi everyone! First off - this subreddit is amazing! All of your stories and posts are so inspiring and definitely keep me from lighting up ever again.

I was wondering, when did your physical cravings end? Do they ever? I'm on day 5 and while it's been easier every day, there are still moments where I almost break. I feel unfocused and irritable and keep thinking if I just had *one* more cig I'd be okay. I read 3-5 days is normally the worst time period, but saw somewhere else that it can take almost two weeks for these intense physical cravings to fade. Just wondering everyone's experience here because wow I feel insane. And I KNOW this feeling will go away if I stay strong for a little longer...but wow it's tough!

Just made it to Week 4!

I honestly never thought I could go this long. A little backstory, I’m 44 and had a (very mild) heart attack on Memorial Day. I had two stints put in. Docs did not say my smoking was the direct cause, but it could lead to complications with the stints if I didn’t quit. That’s a helluva motivator!

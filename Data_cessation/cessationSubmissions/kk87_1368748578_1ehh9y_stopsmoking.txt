Quitting smoking = better mood?

Hi people, this is my first post on this subreddit. :) im a 22 y.o male and i ve been smoking for 4 years. Im in the process of quitting, and i just wanted to share this experience that I have. I ve tried quitting smoking quite a few times and even though I ve failed, I noticed that, apart from the mood swings that were part of the withdrawal symptoms, when I quit smoking, my mood somehow improves. I dont think that this is a placebo,though. Even just one day with no smoking and I can feel my mood improving. Being a person that sufffers from depression, this is something really big for me,apart from the usual health benefits of quitting.
Has anyone else experienced this?

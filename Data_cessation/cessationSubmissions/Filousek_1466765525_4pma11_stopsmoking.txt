Stopping

I have stopped 4 days ago and i feel so good! I feel on my body and mentality how i am free and getting better in everything. 
 Mainly i do not feel guilty to my body for smokung :) i started running and working. I am even more possitive now :)
Of course there are cravings but not that strong because i am really happy now.
I think that quitting smokimg is just about get use to not smoking and do somwthin better than light a tabacco...

I wish you to be strong guys!!!

I don't have children yet, but is it completely horrible of me to consider limiting exposure to aunts, uncles, and grandparents because they smoke cigarettes?

This isn't just from a health perspective of second-hand smoke, it's the entire gamut of effects that come from being around smokers. And although a positive side-effect may be that they quit, I can't helping wondering in the back of my head if I'm just subconsciously using children as a pawn to accomplish that.

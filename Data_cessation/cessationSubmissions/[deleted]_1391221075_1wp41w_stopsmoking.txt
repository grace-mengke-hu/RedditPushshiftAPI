Big (700th) day!

I can't believe I made it this far, and thankfully without having to tear my hair out to do it.  I'll offer the same advice that I always do to others just starting out - I believe there's no such thing as "quitting."  When you're ready to do it, QUIT, and never look back.  It's a Yoda thing...do or do not.  Good luck to everyone out there!

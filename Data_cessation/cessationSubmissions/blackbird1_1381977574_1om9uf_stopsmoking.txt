Day 5 and here it comes

Ok, it's day 5. I made it through the initial 3 days of hell and was feeling good. Now my husband is working out of town for the week and I got sick - stomach stuff, low fever, fun. So I'm bored as hell and lonely and stuck at home and when you're sick of course nothing makes you feel better than a quick nic fix. 
Also, I haven't wanted to work out at all since I quit. What's up with that?

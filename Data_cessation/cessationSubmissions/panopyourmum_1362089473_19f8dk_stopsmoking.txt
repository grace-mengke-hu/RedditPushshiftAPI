Been telling myself I want to quit smoking for ages. This morning I woke up with no ciggies in stock and started skipping rope and doing some shadow boxing to work up a sweat. I know this is a much better stress buster than nicotine but the flesh is weak.
Hoping this time I am not going to relapse.

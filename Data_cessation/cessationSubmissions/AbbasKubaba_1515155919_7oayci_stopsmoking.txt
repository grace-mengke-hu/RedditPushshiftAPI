Feeling really bad today

I have been smoking for about 10 years now, and on new years day, I had my 'last' ciggie. The cravings were terrible. My sister actually hovered around me to keep me from getting up and going out to buy one. Today, I had to leave the house and I have already smoked a packet. When the craving hits I feel like a zombie who only wants to smoke. No other thought in my head. Do they ever stop?? I feel like I've wasted all my sister's efforts and I'm afraid to face her. This sucks.

I'm (hopefully) smoking my last cigarette ever. I need your help though.

I am currently taking the last few drags of a cigarette.  I put it out after that last sentence.  I've been trying to quit for years now.  I've tried everything I can think of.  The patch, eclipse cigarette, nicotine gum, cold turkey, slowly cutting back.  Nothing has worked.  I need to stop this, I have diabetes T2.  It's cleaning out my wallet too.  I need suggestions.  I'm going to try meditating as I saw it in this sub.  Can anyone give me any other ideas?  Thanks for any and all support.

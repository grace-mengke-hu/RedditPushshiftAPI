9 Days and 17 Hours in and now I'm scared

Okay guys, every year around this time I quit smoking because I have health metrics I have to meet. Every year I say I'm going to stay quit but I never have. Today is the day I have to have my contine test (leaving in about 10 minutes) and my brain has reverted me back to day one as far as withdrawl symptoms go. I can't stop the craving, my mouth is watering, my ears are ringing and there is just that feeling.... You know, the one that is right in your face but you can't explainit? At any rate, a little encouragement is needed right now because I feel like I'm on the edge!

Edit - I made it back to work without stopping to buy a pack. The accountability you all just have me made that happen! Thank you for being there for me.

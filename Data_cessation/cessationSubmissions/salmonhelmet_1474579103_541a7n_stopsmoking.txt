Took me a bit to get my mind right...but I'm running with it. Free and clear of nicotine for the first time in 3 decades...

I'm doing something I've never done before. I'm trying cold turkey. Had dozens of attempts before - ranging anywhere from a day to a year and a half off cigarettes but NEVER without a nicotine replacement of some kind. I went to work on Monday without any smokes and have only used will power to stay 100% smoke free this week.

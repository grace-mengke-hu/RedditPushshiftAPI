I had another smoking dream...

I had another smoking dream, probably one of 3 or 4 I have had since I quit, and I think they are great, I wake up SO relieved it was just a dream because going back to smoking would be a huge nightmare. I am thankful because they remind me of how much guilt and terror I would feel If I were no longer a non smoker, without having to actually slip! Anyways my quit is fine and I have 0 intention of ever jeopardizng my "nicotine sobriety", I just wanted to share this. Funnily enough I also murdered two bartenders in this dream and I felt more guilt about the smoking.... hahahah I just found it a strange thought(dont worry I would never murder anyone)

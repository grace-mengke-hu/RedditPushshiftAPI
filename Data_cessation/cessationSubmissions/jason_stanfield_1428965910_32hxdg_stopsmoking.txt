100 days and counting!

I haven't posted much, but I've lurked here quite a lot these past three months.

I'm proud to say I've hit 100 days without a cigarette! 

It was a lot rougher for me than I anticipated, having smoked for 20 years, but I'm at a point now where some days I don't even think about smoking. The craving is still there, and I have to admit I still like the smell of a freshly-lit cigarette (especially with a match ...), but I've got this under control now.

As far as feeling better, I do *some*, but there's been no fever-breaking moment ... and there never will be, but I keep hoping it will happen that one day I wake up suddenly full of energy and vigor.

At any rate, 100 days! Woohoo!

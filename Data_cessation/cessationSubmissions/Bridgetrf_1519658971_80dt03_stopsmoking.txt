Major Milestone

Well, I made it one whole week!  I have quit 8 times since January 1 and only made it 4 days or less, so this is kind of a big deal for me.  Still have cravings every now and then, but it is easier to say no to them.  I don't want to waste these seven days.  Looking back, the week went by faster than expected.  

For all just starting, keep with it!  It WILL get easier.

Thanks Reddit quitters - you guys really inspired me.

Today is the longest I've ever made it

I found this sub the other day and I just wanted to share my story.  I was a smoker for about 9 years.  A pack a day sometimes even more.  It affected my life in some of the stupidest ways, I was choosing cigarettes over gas to get to work.  Then I started rolling my own, I was so proud because depending on the tobacco I purchased it would only cost me about 30 dollars for 2 cartons.  I tried quitting before and the longest I'd ever make it was about 2 weeks.  I don't think I was really ready, I knew it was bad for my health but it was something that helped me with the hard parts of life.  When I got fired from my job when my girlfriend of 3 years cheated on me the list of justifications goes on.  Today I am proud to say it has been 34 days since I last smoked and I couldn't feel better.  I remember it just hit me one day that I didn't feel like smoking anymore.  When that happened I picked a date and stuck to it cold turkey.  It was hard there were days I wanted to give in, but I refused.  Do I miss it sometimes hell last night I dreamed I was smoking.  The thing is as the days have passed I have found it easier and easier to dismiss these cravings.  I'm so happy that I have made it this far and am looking forward to many more days.

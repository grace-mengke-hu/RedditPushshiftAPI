Ok, I am here...

I have been an occasional smoker for a while (maybe 5 packs a year) but after my husband passed, I jumped up to three packs every two months. At first, it was just what I did when I started crying... It gave me something to focus on. Then, my doctor put me on pain killers and smoking in the morning helped keep the fuzzy head at bay. Then, it was an excuse to get out of the office. 

The sad thing is... I don't care if I do or do not smoke. It is seriously a "take it or leave it" thing. But, if I don't care, might as well not care in the direction of better health. 

It has been a week. Out of habit, I still reach for them when I sit down in my car. I am sure this will subside, it is just habit. But there hasn't been a "need a cigarette" feeling. Maybe this is uncovering a deeper problem... I don't feel anymore. I fake happiness for the sake of my family- mostly for my son- but seriously... I just feel blank inside. 

Maybe changing this will spur other health changes that will help that.

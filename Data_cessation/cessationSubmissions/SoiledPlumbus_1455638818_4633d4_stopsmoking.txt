Quit on New Years day. Here's my experience so far

I came to this sub for motivation many times leading up to my decision to quit so I thought I would give some back. I think it will feel good to write out. I was a pack a day smoker for about 12 years. Here are some positive results after only a month and a half of no smoking.

- I can smell/taste things much better. Sometimes I get this intense feeling of nostalgia from certain smells. Probably because I have not smelled them so strongly in a long time. It's a really positive feeling that makes me realize things in general were much clearer before smoking, and can be again.

-  I smell amazing. Sometimes I just smell my shirt/hands and marvel at how nice it feels to be clean. If someone sits beside me on the bus who just smoked it is really horrible. I can't believe I smelled like that, probably worse considering the amount I smoked sometimes. I feel more confident around new people knowing that I don't need to chew gum or wash my hands all the time.  

- My mouth feels so clean. Similar to the smell part of it sometimes I just stop to feel happy that my dental hygiene has improved so much. My teeth already seem noticeably whiter and my tongue is just healthier.

- My thoughts seem more clear. My mood is improved. I feel like my thought process is more measured and grounded. I'm not constantly thinking about the "reasons" I need to drop what I'm doing and go outside to smoke.

- My skin looks much better. I have had skin problems for as long as I can remember. Looking in the mirror my complexion just looks brighter. Maybe part of this is that I look happier in general. The dark circles under my eyes are all but gone and my colour is greatly improved.   

The last thing I would say to you is that other aspects of my life are getting better because of my decision to stop smoking. I feel that if I can quit that habit then I can be more determined in other areas too. I have more energy to exercise and more will power to actually do it. I put things off less often. Why not do it now? People I care about in my life have commented that I seem to have a glow about me and are so happy to know I quit. 

Please stop smoking. You will not regret it. Any positive aspects of the habit are imagined. You will be surprised at how quickly the cravings go away. I know it is different for everyone but I can tell you first hand that you will be so proud of yourself when you get through it. Every day feels like a bright new chance to live life. I will never trade this feeling for an addiction again, not in a million years.

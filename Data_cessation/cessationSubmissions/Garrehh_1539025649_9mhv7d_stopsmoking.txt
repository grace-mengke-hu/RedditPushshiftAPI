I'm killing myself and I can't stop. I need help.

Okay so I'm a pretty heavy smoker. 
I've smoked for about 10 years, ranging from 1 to now 2 packs a day. 
I've quit a few times before so I know what I need to start quitting. 
I was trying to get myself into that mindset where you don't like smoking anymore.


However, today was the day I dreaded.
For a while now the last thought that pops into my head before I fall asleep is that tomorrow might be the day that I die from smoking. 
Today, with every cigarette I smoked, my heart skipped a beat, and then again and again with every puff I inhaled. 
My heart was racing, it felt like an anxiety attack. 
I got short of breath during and after smoking, and I was completely freaked out. 
I felt like I was having a heart attack. 

But this didn't make me stop smoking. 
I smoked less today, that's true, but it wasn't enough on its own to make me quit cold turkey.

So when I got home, I smoked my last cigarette and put on a nicotine patch. 
The cravings have been a struggle, and I'm only a few hours in.
I don't know what to do, how to convince myself that I'm not giving up anything, in fact that if I continue I will die of this.
If anyone has any tips on how to deal with this, please, I'm desperate to get out of this horrible habit. 
I need help.

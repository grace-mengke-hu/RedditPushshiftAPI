Day 2! Tired and cranky AF

At least I am able to admit it;) I keep saying a silent prayer that this too shall pass.  I worked out last night which was a big help with cravings - too tired to think about smoking.  I just noticed my middle and index finger is STILL yellowed from 2 nights ago, I've taken 2 showers and scrubbed madly at it. Disgusting!!! Thank goodness I've got 24 hours smoke free behind me....

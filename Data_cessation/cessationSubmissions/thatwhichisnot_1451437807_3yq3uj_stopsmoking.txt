The Magical Two Weeks

Today marks two whole weeks without a cigarette after over 2 years of smoking. Everyone keeps telling me it gets easier after 2 weeks without smoking, but I somehow find myself craving a smoke more now than ever. I quit cold turkey, but I don't really trust myself to stay smoke free. Any good quitting tips/tricks to keep myself off nicotine?

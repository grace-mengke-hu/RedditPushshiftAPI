I smoked for 15 years. Today is my one year anniversary staying quit and I want to help others

I tried numerous ways of putting the cigarette down. Willpower, pipes, chewing tobacco, nicotine gum, etc... All have failed me except for one thing. Allen Carr's book The Easyway to Stop Smoking. He was a hundred cigarettes a day to zero in a flash. I was smoking a pack a day and I immediately stopped. No withdrawals, no uses of will power, no substitutes. The best thing about is the book instructs you to smoke while reading it. There are no scare tactics to be found inside, just positive reinforcement. 

Those of you who are looking to quit, read the book... you have nothing to lose. Those who used willpower to quit but are finding it difficult, read the book (without smoking), and you will find some relief. Those who need some reminder of why it's good to not smoke, this book works for that as well. Anyway, I wish the best to all of you and it doesn't matter how you quit... congratulations that you did!

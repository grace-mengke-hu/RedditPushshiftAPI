Trying again

I quit cold turkey for 54 days and I was so proud of myself, 38 days ago I had one cigarette and have smoked everyday since. I’m gutted that I picked up that cig in the first place, it’s so insidious with how it just hooks you again. Sorry for the ramble but I’m laying in bed and feeling so sad about it. Tomorrow I am going to start day 1 again cold turkey, wish me luck please ! I’ve realised i had my first cigarette almost 10 years ago and I’m only in my mid twenties. 

I know I should be positive but I’m feeling so down about it all :(

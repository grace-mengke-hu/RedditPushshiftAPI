I'm a non smoker and I'm guilty.

Hello friends, :(

Making this short, I am ridden with guilt and negative feelings right now during my quit. I managed to have a good smoke free week under my belt before the new year.

I proved to myself that now was the best time and that I could do this, I felt amazing. I was more than a week smoke free and I managed to drink with friends and not smoke a single puff! I was so proud of myself and had all the confidence in the world to stick with my quit.

Then I made the stupid rationalization that is all too common, just one, before the new year, I should smoke one. I ruined my progress before the new year.

Now I am stuck with the cliche New Years resolution quit and I feel awful and embarrassed that I threw away the progress that I felt so great about.

Am I wrong to feel this way? How can I feel as good about this quit as I did with my last?

I know this is long and more of a ramble and rant but I just needed to share my guilt. Thank you for reading and for being such an awesome community. Any feedback and support is greatly appreciated :)

TL;DR: I relapsed after a week right before New Years, now I feel awful and want to give up.

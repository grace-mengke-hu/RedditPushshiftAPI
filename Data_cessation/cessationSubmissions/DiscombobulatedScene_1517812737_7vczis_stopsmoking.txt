Day 1 (Let's gooooooo!)

I'm 25 and have attempted on and off for the past year or year and a half with quitting. I don't think i want to get into the details of it. There's nothing really special about it. It's just stuff that has already been said on here before. I suppose i'm posting here because it's nice to feel like you're a part of something. So i've put down my date of quitting as the 6th of February, which is actually tommorow, but i seem to have 1 day on my badge. Yay. Anyway, i'll post periodically on here. Hope i'll be able to help people. Happy journeying y'all!

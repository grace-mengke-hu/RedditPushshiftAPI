4 Months

So I'm 4 months in and I feel great. No cravings whatsoever.  Even my anxiety and depression didn't interfere with my quitting.
  
I still pop in here every now and then to read your stories and give advice where I can.

Keep it up guys and if you stumble, be assured that we in this sub will be there to help pick you up.

Wish me luck.

Gave my lighter and the half pack I had left to a fellow smoker today. Gonna attempt cold turkey. Wish me luck please =]. I'll be checking in daily, and probably every time I get the urge to read comments to keep my willpower.

Edit #1: Bought the Allen Carr book. I'll add another edit when I'm done reading it.

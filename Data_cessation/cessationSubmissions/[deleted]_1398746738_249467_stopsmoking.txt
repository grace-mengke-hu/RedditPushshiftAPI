I hate to say this, but day 0

Well over the past month, it's been on and off.  I made it to day ten a while ago and ended up smoking due to some stress.  That was around the start of April, since then I've been going like 3 days without, then end up buying a pack and smoking for a day. 2 days without then buying a pack and sadly this cycle has been repeating itself.  Today I was on day 2 and it was going quite well, then I got disciplined at work for taking an extra break, which happened a few days ago, for smoking ironically enough.  So I ended up leaving early, a little disturbed, but to clear my mind and gather my thoughts. 

Sadly when I got home, I did not gather my thoughts.  So I've been having some trouble with a girl recently and ended up getting too deep in my thoughts, (which is one of the things I love about not smoking is the clarity that comes) and got a little too anxious.  I ended up buying a pack of cigarettes and drove around town for 3 hours, chain smoking all 20 cigarettes, just thinking about life, work, relationships and such.  

So I've come to this conclusion and am finally posting here.  I'm done.  I'm done smoking!  There is absolutely no benefit whatsoever as you all know.  Hard times are still going to come.  I still will get in trouble at work (just not for smoking)  There will always be girl problems (so I'm told) but smoking is not the way to deal with it.  So r/stopsmoking, it's April 28th, 2014 at 11:46 pm and I'm done! 

**TL:DR: Smoking doesn't solve anything, I'm done**

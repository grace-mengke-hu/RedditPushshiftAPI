Can someone please recommend a brand of E-cigs? Im not sure what to get.

I'm 28, been smoking since 15. I really wanna quit, but can't seem to do it. Tried buying $5 e-eigs at the petrol station, but they didn't do anything for me.

Is there a brand someone can suggest I go for. I wanna be able to buy it on eBay.

Thanks heaps, would really appreciate your help.

Good luck with your own battle friends. Seriously, fuck smoking!

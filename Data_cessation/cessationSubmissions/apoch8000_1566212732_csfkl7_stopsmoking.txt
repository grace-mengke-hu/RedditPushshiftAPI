Here goes my second shot at it. Stopped for 4 months but FU.

So, I quit from March until July. The first summer evening, some beers and a chill vibe seduced me to try a cigarette from a friend. The day after I already bought my own pack of cigarettes again. Anyway, we're 1,5 month further now and with the end of the summer in sight, I'm ready to give it a new shot. 

REMEMBER: even 1 cigarette can ruin everything!

50 days

Just checking in. I quit smoking cigarettes using nicotine gum for 2 weeks. I also used weed to quit smoking but now I'm quitting that too. I'm on day 3 of no weed. I went for a run last night around the neighborhood and it felt great. I did have slightly shortness of breath but I did it. My lungs feel so much better and I really feel good about making the decision to quit. I was a pack a day smoker for a couple years and I've smoked for 9 years or so. Since 14 years old and I'm 23 now. I do not get the urge to smoke cigarettes much at all anymore. Which is great but I contribute that to smoking weed. Now that I'm quitting that life is really hard but I'm hanging in there. Keep up the good work everybody quitting cigs is 100% worth it.  I've saved so much h money  and my Sense of smell is so much better. But most of all I'm not out of breath just walking up a staircase.

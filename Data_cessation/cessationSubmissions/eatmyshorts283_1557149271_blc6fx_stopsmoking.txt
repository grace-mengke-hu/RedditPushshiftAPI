I moved back to my hometown for the summer after a month of being smoke free

Because of all the stress and old habits I had here I started getting serious urges and was about to go buy a pack, but my fuel pumps quit on me and I ended up outlasting the cravings. Just thought it was beautiful timing, Iâ€™ve never been more grateful to have something go wrong.

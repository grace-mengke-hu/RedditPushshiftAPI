Day three depression

It's day three of quit attempt number 8 and the cravings have been tolerable. The biggest issue I'm having is that today and yesterday, I've been so sad. I haven't enjoyed a single thing. I feel exactly like the Zoloft commercial. I see a psych for generalized anxiety disorder and am taking an SNRI and sleep meds for that. Does anyone think this is quit related? If so, other than bringing it up with my doctor next month, what can I do?

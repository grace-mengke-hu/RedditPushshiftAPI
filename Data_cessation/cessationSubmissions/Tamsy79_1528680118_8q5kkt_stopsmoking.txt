So I Made Asparagus

Made supper tonight as per usual. BBQed chicken and some asparagus. I could not believe how amazing the asparagus tasted! I kept saying to my husband, "isn't it the best ever?" And he keeps saying "tastes the same as always". Then it clicked. I haven't truly tasted asparagus in 23 years. Day 4 quit for me and that was really great.

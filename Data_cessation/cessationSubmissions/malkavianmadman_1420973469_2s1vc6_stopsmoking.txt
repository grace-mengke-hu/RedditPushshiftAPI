What do you consider the hardest day?

Hey everyone. So today has been pretty up and down for me. It seems for everything that makes me happy im a non smoker there is something that just makes me feel like shit for no reason.

So I was wondering what people consider the hardest day? I am going it cold turkey at the moment, and emotionally today has been the worst. Hell I almost started laying into the wall next to my computer with my fists. Only thing that stopped me is the fact I don't want to break my hands on a concrete wall.

I am trying my best, but my god if I had had the cash today I think I would have brought a pack.

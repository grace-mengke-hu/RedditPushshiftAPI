Day 1 Thanks to this sub

I am 18 weeks pregnant and have been trying to quit since I found out. I have been a pack a day smoker for 10 years, and the guilt has been overwhelming lately but my many attempts to quit never work. I found this sub last night when googling for ways to overcome cigarette cravings and it was the punch I needed. Seeing the stories of long time smokers kicking the disgusting habit have given me so much hope. I'm 13 hours in, occasionally using a vape for the hand to mouth motion, but I am so proud of myself. Normally by this point I'd be searching my house for left over cigs or making the trip to the gas station. Instead, I'm drinking my coffee and reading all the lovely success stories on here keeping myself occupied. So thanks reddit, I feel this time is really going to be successful with your help!

I had a dream last night....

I was driving around with a friend. They were smoking. I bummed a cigarette of them, lit it and put it up to my mouth. The second before it touched my lips I stopped and said " Wait! I quit smoking!!" And then I threw the cigarette away.  

Hooray for subconscious being on board!!! Also, it made me wonder if non-smokers ever dream about smoking......

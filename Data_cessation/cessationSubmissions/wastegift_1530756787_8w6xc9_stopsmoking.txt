I NEED to quit, please help!!

I'm a singer and I've noticed my voice doesn't sound as good as it used to even a week ago; I quit cigs about a month ago so I've been using my vape. 

It doesn't help that I hit it every 30 seconds because my body really "needs" the nicotine. I've tried putting less nic in there, but it just makes me hit it more often, subconsciously.

Apparently I didn't care about the awful health effects before I noticed this, but now I have even MORE of a reason to quit!

Anyone have any ideas for me to stop vaping so god damn much? I think I can stay off cigarettes but I really need to quit vaping too it seems, which sucks, I really love the act of smoking so a nicotine patch wouldn't do much for me.

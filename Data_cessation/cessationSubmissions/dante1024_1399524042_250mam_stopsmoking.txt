One month in, cold turkey :)

So, I'm 31 days into my quit. Cold turkey, and I feel great!

Not regretting the decision for a second. I feel physically so much better, and (I sing in a band) I've been able to hit notes that I wasn't able to even get close to before. The only thing I don't understand, is why I waited so long to stop.

But then there's a slight downside. I've noticed myself becoming a bit more prone to overeating and drinking alcohol. Not to the point where it's a huge problem, but it's enough to annoy/worry me. No real weight gain as of yet, maybe a couple of pounds, but that's about it. The eating bothers me more than the drinking, as I keep the alcohol confined to the weekends for the most part.

How do you guys deal with the whole "craving other nice things because you don't smoke anymore" problem?

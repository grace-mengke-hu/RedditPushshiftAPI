Day 1, attempt 3. This time for myself.

Been a smoker for the last 8 1/2 years or so, I'm almost 30, and I decided on a random whim before bed that I was going to stop smoking tobacco. My first thought was, "I wonder if there's a sub for that?" My second thought was, "Of course there's a sub for that!"

The first time I tried to quit was a few months after I started (partly due to a prospective relationship), and lasted for just over a month until I went to a bar for the first time. The second time was a couple years ago, also due to a relationship with the same person, and lasted for about half a year until that relationship ended. Tonight is my third go (third time's a charm?), and this time I'm doing because its my own decision, and I'm doing it solely for me. No passing the blame, time to take responsibility on this.

Wish me luck?

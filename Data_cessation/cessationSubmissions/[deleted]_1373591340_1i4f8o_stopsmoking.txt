It has now been 25 hours since my last smoke.

Hi guys,

I am a 22 year old who has been smoking for 5 years. I was smoking 10-15 cigarettes a day and now I've decided to commit to quitting. Although everyone around me smokes, I seem to be fairing well.

The withdrawal symptoms today were horrific. I was driving and I thought "if I just get a pack of cigs, this will all go away." Thankfully I survived that and the next 2 major cravings okay.

How much longer does withdrawal last? When do the cravings go away if ever?

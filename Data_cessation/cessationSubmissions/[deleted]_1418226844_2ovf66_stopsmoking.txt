on the verge of three weeks...

I am just checking in. I have been a non-smoker for the past 19 days, and soon to be three weeks. I have slipped up twice. Each time three puffs before I decided not to continue. Before I was disgusted by the smell,  disappointed by my action, and learnt a valuable lesson. 
The goods, however, are that I can run! I can start running right after I wake up to catch the bus, and not feel as if my heart is about to stop. I don't feel tired in the morning any more, or smell terrible, or feel annoyed and irritated all the time. I have seen how useless cigarettes are, and I have realized that I will be having a much better life without cigarettes. Not to mention that I have saved 280 dollars so far! 

Keep strong!

I need to stop

I’m 20 and have been smoking for 3 years now and I have asthma and it’s even worse for me and recently these past 3 days I’ve been having heart problems and really do need to stop that way I don’t have a heart attack at such a young age. I’ve read that smoking after a week or even a year can start to repair your body slowly and you’ll start feeling better. I’m going to go smoke my last cigarette right now then I’m done.

Survived my first football game

My god tailgating is difficult with no smokes. Had to say no to just about all my friends. I actually found it comforting in standing by them and knowing that I could stand strong. Conceited is the word I'm looking for. The posts on here are quite helpful and thanks for all. So far so good.

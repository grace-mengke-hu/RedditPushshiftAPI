Working on 6 months now...DAE...

kind of forget that they used to smoke?  When I first quit, I thought about it multiple times a day.  Then it went down to once a day.  Then more.  At this point, *maybe* once a week, more like every other week, I have a moment like "Hey!  I used to smoke!  Weird...."  

I was curious whether others had this same experience and wanted to maybe give some hope to those who feel like they can't get it out of their heads right now.  Give it some time....

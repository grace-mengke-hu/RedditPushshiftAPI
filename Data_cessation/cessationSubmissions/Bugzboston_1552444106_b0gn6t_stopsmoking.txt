Seriously need some help with withdrawals

Wrapping up day 7 without a cig and just over 48 hours nicotine free. Knowing that by this time tomorrow all nicotine will be gone from my body, I do not want to put on a patch. 

That said, my legs are restless. So restless that I can’t fall asleep.  What can I do about this? I’m so exhausted and just want to cry.

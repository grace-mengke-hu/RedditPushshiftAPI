Today is my official quit day! Words of wisdom and encouragement would be greatly appreciated! -possibly tl, apologies!

I have been smoking for approximately 8 years, I fluctuated between half a pack to a pack to a pack and a half a day. I have maintained an active, healthy and outdoor lifestyle during that time and can still outrun my non smoking friends! That does not make it okay to smoke! 

Today is my official quit day. I have been reducing the amount I smoke in a day, when I smoke and recognizing all of my triggers so that I can find an alternative to help me through the cravings when they are at their worst. Eating healthy has been my saving grace recently, especially the banana.
It's time to quit. I am now 25 and realize I turn to smoking out of boredom, habit and addiction, not out of enjoyment.

The majority of my peers continue to smoke, making my decision to quit difficult, especially now that second winter has begun to fade and summer/construction season is upon us. 

My family is dominated by non smokers, so I do not have a support group that understands how difficult it is. I know your encouragement and words of wisdom will help me through this!

Best of luck to all of my fellow  quitters out there! We can do this!

Gaining muscle after quitting smoking

I don't know if it's the appetite suppressing effects or some metabolism thing, but I've been lifting weights for years, unable to break past 185 pounds (6' 1"). I quit smoking 78 days ago and since then I've gained a whopping 10 pounds. Guaranteed, some of that must be fat, but it sure looks like muscle in the mirror. If I had known this would happen I would have quit a lot sooner. Anyone else who's into working out had a similar experience?

Day 1 here we go.. again...

I've quit so many times. Once for up to 9 months and then relapsed. Starting again today. Been 'binging' on fighting my bad habits lately and this is the one I need to crush most. 

In the worlds of my brother: 

> "Quitting should be the easiest thing in the world. You literally just have to do *nothing*. If you smoke or buy a pack you are *doing something*. In return for doing nothing you have everything to gain in terms of health, finances and self respect."

I have mad respect for the people I see on here with a few months, let alone 1200+ day badges.

I think a big part of my motivation to give this a more serious go was rule [#4 from this article](http://zenhabits.net/10-tips-for-quitting-smoking/) which states:

> #4. Not One Puff, Ever (N.O.P.E.). The mind is a tricky thing. It will tell you that one cigarette won’t hurt. And it’s hard to argue with that logic, especially when you’re in the middle of an urge. And those urges are super hard to argue with. Don’t give in. Tell yourself, before the urges come, that you will not smoke a single puff, ever again. Because the truth is, that one puff WILL hurt. One puff leads to a second, and a third, and soon you’re not quitting, you’re smoking. Don’t fool yourself. A single puff will almost always lead to a recession. DO NOT TAKE A SINGLE PUFF!

In the past I always have crumbled after only '1 or 2 drags' while out drinking. I need to recognize that this is a life change and a hard one at that. Even small relapses have big consequences.

Wish me luck...

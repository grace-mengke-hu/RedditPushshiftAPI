Just checking in! Nicotine free for 72 hrs!

I've been smoke free for almost 10 days (I started off with nicotine patches), but thanks to lots of helpful advice from everyone here, I removed the patches on Saturday.
I've been nicotine free for 72 hrs, and with the help of bupropin, my smoke free app and everyone here, it has been way easier than I thought and I am feeling positive and happy 

Best of luck to everyone!

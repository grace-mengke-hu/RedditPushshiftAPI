Over a month in and still feeling bad

Let me start off by saying I'm in no danger of going back. This quit has been so bad for me that I would actually have to be insane to put myself through it again.

My anxiety was really bad right after I quit. My legs trembled and there were all sorts of other physical effects. 

But one thing that's lingered is a tightness in my chest, and the feeling that I can't catch my breath. I'm only 25, and the doc said I was too young for any serious lung damage.

Anyone else feeling this too? Basically, is this normal?

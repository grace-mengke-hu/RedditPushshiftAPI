Approaching 3 weeks! Feeling and looking good.

After going through hell and back again, I am proudly standing here about 3 weeks off of cigarettes. I am happy to say that I am relieved to be finally done with them.

I have been going through some tough stuff, including:

-Flashbacks

-Nightmares 

-Cravings

Mostly due to the habit that is still there in my mind. It isn't that bad anymore, but wow, does it surprise you sometimes. 

The longer I go without, the longer I can go about forgetting. This is the one thing I learned through this entire time. Exercise makes it easier, but wow. I never realized until now how much I relied on them.

Thank you guys for your support. I know this will get easier, but everything takes time, patience, and little bit of restraint to get though it all.

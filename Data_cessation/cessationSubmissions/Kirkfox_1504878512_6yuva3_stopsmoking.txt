Day 2

Wife.is still going good on her part.
Other than my slip yesterday ive been having cravings like im starving and.smoking is life lol.
Couple questions   
1- should i start vaping instead.
2- can i suck on straws or toothpicks instead lol 
3- should i just go to the walk-in clinic and get nico patches or those little things you puff on.

Anyways.... i miss smoking, caught myself blankly staring outside for a good 10 mintes, until my wife asked what I'm looking at.
instead.of saying "i think its because normally, i would be smoking out on the balcony about this time" I said "Nothing"....
Have a great day peeps, read your posts now and upvote and possibly comment.... 
I'm rambling.now because its keeping my sausage fingers busy...

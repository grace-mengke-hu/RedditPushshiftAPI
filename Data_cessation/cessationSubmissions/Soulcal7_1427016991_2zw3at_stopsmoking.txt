Got drunk and chilled with my old stoner buddies

So I recently came home from university as it's my holiday break for the next 4 weeks, and so far I've been doing really well at university trying to quit smoking.

Yesterday I went out with my friends to the park. It was sunny and everyone was chilled so I had a few cans of beer. Everyone was chilling, smoking rollies and spliffs. I got offered a few times by everyone, with a lot of them forgetting I'm quitting (they were high).

And I'm glad to say that I managed to kick all cravings and stay smoke free. This was probably the biggest test for me so far as I smoked weed for 3 years everyday for my social anxiety, and even though there was a large group (12+) of us, I still controlled my cravings.

So yeah, I thought I'd share my little success with you guys and wish you all the best on quitting too :)

Edit: Thank you for gold, kind stranger! Means alot for the support!

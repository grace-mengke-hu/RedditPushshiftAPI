Ok, 3rd time quitting and am wondering about vaping

So I've quit smoking twice before once for a month and once for about two weeks but the only problem is I've started smoking three times. I know there's a laundry list of smoking cessation aides but none of them really do anything for me. I'm wondering if anybody has successfully used vaping to quit smoking and weaning themselves off nicotine AND managed to not become addicted to vape. I have a few other tricks up my sleeve but I'd like to know some of yours that may not be considered conventional. Thanks friends :)

Occasional chain smoking

I can go weeks and months without smoking at all, I don't feel the need and I don't even think of cigarettes. And then suddenly I buy myself a pack and can go through it within few hours. That is happening to me now, as I type. I bought a 20-cig pack couple hours ago and have only 7 left. The last time it happened to me before was in July last year. 

I am not stressed out more than usual, I just had this sudden thought: "why won't I just spend few hours reading, drinking tea and smoking?". Honestly, that is my idea of enjoying my day off today. 

DAE smokes this way? Once a year or month going through so many cigs and then stops? What could trigger this urge? How can I fight it next time?

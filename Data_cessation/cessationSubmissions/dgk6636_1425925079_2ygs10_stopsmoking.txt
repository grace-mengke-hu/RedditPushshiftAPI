Finishing up the patch tomorrow. Any advice?

I've quit smoking once before. Unfortunately, I started again and turned to an ecig. I spent 2 years on the ecig and decided that the habit needs to go. I am currently on the patch, finishing up the 8 week regiment tomorrow.

I'm kind of nervous as I'm not sure what to expect. Google seems to have failed me. Does any here have any advice or experiences that they'd like to share?

Will the withdrawals be as bad as quitting smoking cold turkey?

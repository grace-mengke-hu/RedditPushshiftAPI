1 month smoke and nicotine free

After 30 years of smoking a pack a day I finally feel free from it. I still get cravings but they are not as bad as the first couple of weeks.
This subreddit has been a great help along with whyquit.com so thanks to everyone who has posted up their trials and tribulations, it is great to know that what I am going through is normal and everyone who has stayed a non-smoker has had to do the same.
Looking forward to the family get together this Christmas and not having to sneak off with my brother in law for a quick durrie.
Never take another puff!!!

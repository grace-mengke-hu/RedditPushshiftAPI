I need help, I'm addicted to the habit of smoking.

Hello everyone, 6 months ago, I changed my lifestyle and started a weight loss journey, with that I quit all of the unhealthy habits I used to do, including smoking. I successfully quit smoking for 4 months, and then I returned, and I don't have the same will power as I did before. The thing is, I'm addicted to the habit of smoking, I LOVE standing outside and smoking a cigarette, it's weird. I want to hate this habit, and I don't want to have the urge to smoke every time I'm bored, or when I'm sitting in the outdoors with great weather. What should I do to stop this habit? it's affecting my progress.

EDIT:I liked the idea of doing something else when I'm in a spot where I have an urge to smoke, it might work out well.

Thanks a lot :>

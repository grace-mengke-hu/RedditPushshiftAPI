Two and a half weeks and I've already forgot I smoked.

I was watching the new 007 Skyfall last night, and the casino scene came on. The girl Bond was talking with had a lit cigarette, and all I thought was: "Man, she's too attractive to smoke."

During the roll of the credits at the end I realized seeing her smoking didn't bring up a single thought about ME smoking. No "Now I want a cigarette" or even a "I used to do that" thought.

It was then I realized; I'M FREE.

Just remember, all the discomfort you feel isn't from not having a cigarette, it's from your body healing and trying to tell you to NOT have another one! Stay strong folks!

Smoking to drink or drinking to smoke?

I'm convinced the only reason I continue to go to a particular bar, is because I can smoke there. I know, in the back of my head, the only reason I'm going, is to smoke. Well, and drink too. 
That should be another side effect listed with smoking. Drinking!
Anyway, I relapsed after 38 hours. Back on the wagon again, starting tomorrow!
Looks like I'll be swearing off cigs AND booze. :)

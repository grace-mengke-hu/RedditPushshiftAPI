I appear to be about to enter complete 'fuck it' mode

Yes, it's me again, on the verge of a mental breakdown. 

11 months in (nearly) and still thinking about smoking on a daily basis. 

I've had a nasty letter from HMRC this evening which just about tops off 6 months of shit. 

I'm pretty much done with this - I'm past the point of caring about life generally, so why would smoking not be a good idea? 

Basically need talking off the edge.

I'm not off to buy a pack now or anything. But there's a chance I'd think it were a good idea tomorrow. 

What is the actual point?

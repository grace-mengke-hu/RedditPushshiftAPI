6th

Hey guys. I feel like i owe this sub alot so i just thought that i'd stop by and say few words. I've celebrated  my sixth months 2 days ago. Thats a particularly important milestone cause i never thought i'd be able to do it. I am having huge triggers for the couple of days but i just dont care anymore. I got used to it. Its no worse than being a smoker. I would like to refer to a dialog i've had with 2 of my smoker friends the other day which i believe is influential. One of them gave me a pat on the back and said that i did great and that i should have felt like a champion. without thinking or trying to be the mr smartie pants i replied to him saying that what i'd been doing for the last 6th months is hell lot easier than being a smoker. both my friends were surprised about my response. I said with a grin on my face that being a smoker is very hard. You need to make sure that you have nicotine all the time. you need to damage your health to feed yourself. you are being condemned to outdoor for smoking. you also need to watch out advertorials or stuff like that because you need to block your mind to all those horrible diseases . thats way more difficult . I am pretty sure they are already considering quitting. i also recommend this sub to all my smoker friends. god bless you all

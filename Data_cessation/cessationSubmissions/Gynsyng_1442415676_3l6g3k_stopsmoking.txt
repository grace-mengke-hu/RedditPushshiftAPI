1 Month! I take the stairs now.

11 flights of stairs to my office. I do it because I can. The health benefits of quitting are becoming more apparent everyday. If you are thinking about quitting, please don't be afraid. It's easier than you think. I smoked for thirty years and I will never smoke again. To think about the freedoms I gave up for smoking makes me sick. Don't wait another day.

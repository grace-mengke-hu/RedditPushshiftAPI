The long drive home

Lately my biggest struggle is, as the title suggests, the long drive home.  And lately, I have been failing at passing through with success.  I have absolutely no problem getting to work and chilling at my desk or wandering during break times.  The urge is dead to me at these times; it would be odder to go out and smoke.  Once I leave, passing every purveyor of death is a battle.  I made it yesterday.  I made it several days in a row weeks and months past.  It's been a while since I posted, trying to fight alone and shy away from my failure; maybe some outside advice will be helpful.

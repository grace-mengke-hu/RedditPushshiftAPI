Cigarette dreams?

I'm about 2 months into quitting, and now I feel like I can finally go out and do the things I want to do without fear of picking up a cigarette. For the first month cigarette free, I would avoid going out, fearing I would end up smoking, as almost all of my friends smoke. 

Lately, I've gotten over this hump, and started going out with my friends, and am once again enjoying one of my other favorite vices: alcohol. Alcohol and cigs used to be the match made in heaven for a night out, but now I've been able to curb the cravings when I'm drunk, but after a night of boozing, I get dreams that I'm in a situation where I'm offered a smoke, and I just say "Fuck it!". These dreams have been getting more frequent, especially on those extra stressful days at work.

Do any of you guys get these "cigarette dreams" after a night out or stressful day?

Day 3, still going strong.

Today is my third day, without any nicotine in my body. 

Yesterday proved to be a challenge. Dealt with my ex girlfriend and working out things with her (completely different story there, ha) went on a road trip with her as well. Went to my pool match, which is filled with smokers as it's a pool hall/bar setting, and even had 2 beers, all without asking for as much as a drag. 

Found myself thinking about the act of not smoking a lot though, which I coped very well with. Hell today is one of the most stressful days at my job in a long time, and I'm still just going strong. Thanks to all of you who have helped and put in good words thus far. You're all great.

Fuck cigarettes.

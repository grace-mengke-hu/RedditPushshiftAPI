How does everyone feel about nicotene-free vaporizers?

They've been helping me along my way. It's harmless vapor so I don't see any issue with it. I just have a puff or two when I get a craving and just move on. Also, tea has been helping a lot (Vanilla Oolong & Countess of Seville are my favourites so far).

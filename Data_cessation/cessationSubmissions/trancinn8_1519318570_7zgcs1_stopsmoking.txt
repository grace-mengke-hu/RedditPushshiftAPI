New here, 4 days in so far.

Harro there all my new friends of this subreddit,

I'm currently on day 4 from a cold turkey quit from a pack a day for 10yrs but I am smoking weed to supplement (a bowl here and there).

Decided to quit smoking not just for better health and financial savings, but to also improve my potential effectiveness of being a police officer, I'm currently a restaurant franchise owner and I'm going to leave it for a more rewarding life of being a cop.

Started this by accident actually as I was on a 3 day Ski trip with no pack on me and was like hmm how long could I go for. I found that destracting myself with activities around was the easiest to get my mind off it. During non ski hours, that's when your will power really comes to the test but what I did to overcome it was relating a smoke to McDonald's and relating another random activity to other better food (like literally any activity, I was cleaning the whole hotel room one morning at 6am just to not have that morning smoke) , sure I could have McDs but why have McDs when I could have "x" instead.

 Not going to lie thought, the first 3-4 days are hard: I'm constantly sweating and have to rotate my pillow cause it's all wet, and I was puking out every meal but for myself, I embrace the vomit, I have metaphorically linked the yake to the control cigarettes had on me, so every time I upchuck "the cigarette addiction is leaving me body" 

I'll update this monthly to keep myself determined and also to aid my fellow comrades of reddit to a day where we could all breathe clean together, keep fighting the good fight guys, there is a victory at the end of this!

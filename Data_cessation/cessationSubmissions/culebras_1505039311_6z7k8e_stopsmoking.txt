I met good friends i hadn't seen for 6 years, they all smoke. First crave in a many months.

When having part in alcohol enduced reminiscing at sunrise, a cigarette felt like something that had to be present. 

My guard wasn't down though, craving lasted 30 seconds, i proceeded to have a spectacular week without smoking.

When i was thinking on quitting, i always thought of this as one of the moments that would be "unbearable". It was in fact, much better without the pack-and-a-half-hangover the day after

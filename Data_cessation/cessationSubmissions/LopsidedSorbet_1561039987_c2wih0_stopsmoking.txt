When should I call my doctor?

I have a history of major depression but I've been symptom free for a year. Quit smoking 21 days ago and I feel horrible. It started on day 16 and keeps getting worse. I'm having crying spells at work now. Can't eat. Should I give this some more time before trying to get help?

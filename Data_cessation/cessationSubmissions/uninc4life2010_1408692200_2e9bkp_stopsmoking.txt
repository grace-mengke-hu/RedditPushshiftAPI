How many days does it take to get past the "withdrawal" symptoms of nicotine?

I have heard people say that if you can go 3 full days without a cigarette, you can go forever.  Some say 4, some say a full week.  How long would you all say that initial "withdrawal" period lasts, and is it really easier to stay off the sticks once you get past those first few days?

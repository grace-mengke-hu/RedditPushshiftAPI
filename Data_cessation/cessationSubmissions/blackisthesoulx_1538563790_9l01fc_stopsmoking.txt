Need advice on stopping smoking. Never quit cold turkey before.

I’m 23 and have smoked since I was 14. I’ve been wanting to stop for the past year but have always put it off. I stopped for a year in 2014 but went onto the ecig and I didn’t even really stop because I still smoked when I had a drink. 

I am determined to stop soon. I want to go cold turkey, I am sensitive to drugs. I get nicotine rush on a morning so I know once nicotine is out of my system if I have a cigarette it’ll make me feel horrible. (Same story for my Grandma, she stopped, gave in and had a cig, was sick and never touched a cigarette again)

My question is what am I to expect and how long for? In terms of withdrawals etc. 
And does anyone have any coping mechanisms? I see smoking as a reward. I will smoke after doing washing or cleaning up and the morning cig is a tough one to beat. I have gotten to going 2 hours without having a cig when I wake up but then I will chain smoke 2-3 cigs so that’s kinda pointless. 

Any advice will be appreciated. And congrats to those who have managed to and who are on the journey of quitting now :)

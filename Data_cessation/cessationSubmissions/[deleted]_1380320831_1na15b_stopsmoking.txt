I just smoked for the first time ever.

This is the first and last time I will smoke. I was raised to believe (rightly so) that smoking is bad for you, if you do it often. Because of that, I've developed this disgust for smoking in general. But I did it today for the first time. I'm 20. 

Not sure what to say, really... I've been extremely stressed out and everything just keeps piling on... and the last raindrop hit me today. The flood poured out, and I heard smoking helps take an edge off... so I tried it. I got the cheapest pack I could, which turned out to be cigars instead of cigarettes. I don't know the difference, what ever. So I lit up, and took a drag... nothing special happened like I was expecting. No buzz washed over me, I didn't cough incessantly like you see first-timers in the movies do. It was weird. I kind of wish it did make me feel good. God knows, I need it.

I want to know: what made you start? Does/did it feel good? What makes it so hard to stop?

Edit: I wasn't planning on doing it again. I didn't enjoy it, I don't want to keep doing it. I just wished that it had helped. But on the other hand, I'm glad it didn't. Because if it did, I probably would've done it again.

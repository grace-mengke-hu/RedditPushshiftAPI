Does anyone else still think about it, regardless of how many days it's been?

I don't mean in terms of actually smoking one, but rather as just an object that exists in the world. I only ask because it's been happening to me a lot lately. I am always thinking about cigarettes, but the thoughts are not a craving. I assume this is normal.

Did the patch for 4 weeks, read Allen Carr's book, now i'm off nicotine for good

The patch helped me get rid of the physical habit.  It also gave me confidence as I had never been smoke free for that long.  But I knew I was still addicted to nicotine.   

After reading Allen Carr's  book it was a no brainer...the patch needed to go.  It's been 24hrs now.  So far I feel fine.

My One Millionth time trying to quit`

I have tried to quit about a million times,  every time it is the same I can make it a couple days, or a week or whatever when I am off of work, but the minute i  am going to work I break down and buy a pack.  I have probably done this every week for the last 3 years.  

Today I made it to work.  I quit Friday and here I  sit I can't concentrate on anything, but I found this subreddit and honestly probably the only thing keeping me going is reading these posts.  Thank the Gods my boss isn't in today, I am a wreck.

I think the reason I was able to make it today is that over the last year or so my chest and lungs have begun to feel different, It sort of feels like it is tight, not really that i have trouble breathing, but that I can feel it when I breathe if that makes sense.  Worried myself sick over it last night and didn't sleep until the wee hours.  Anxiety is always an issue - probably why I smoked a pack-a-day for 25 years.  Not smoking is definitely not helping that.

I just need to make it to Wednesday afternoon, then 4 more days off should be easy enough.

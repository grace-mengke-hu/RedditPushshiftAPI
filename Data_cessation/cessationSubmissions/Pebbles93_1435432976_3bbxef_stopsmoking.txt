Smoking dreams? And slight boast!!

I stopped smoking on the 11th May. I can't see my flair to see how many days that is because I am on mobile, but I think it is about 7 weeks?

Iv started to have some super realistic dreams about smoking. So much so that the past two mornings I have woken up very annoyed with myself for having a ciggerette, even know it was just a dream!

Is this normal?? And how long should I expect it to last?

On a positive, I am now able to get shit faced drunk without being tempted at all to have a smoke so woohoo!!!!

Day 1 is easy...

...Day 3 is hard. I recently passed 40 days no contact with my ultra toxic ex. Next step? Quit smoking. I've almost finished Day 1. Day 2 will likely be stressful. Day 3??? Unbearable. There will be lots of bargaining and lots justification. Keeping this here as a reminder to keep stepping forward. 

Good luck in your quest, everyone! If I can quit my awful ex, I can quit cancer sticks as well! :-)

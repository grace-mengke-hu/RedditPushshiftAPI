No physical cravings! But...

So my flair is a little wonky because I smoked my "last" cigarette last Wednesday but drunkenly split one on Friday and didn't want to cheat on my flair progress. Which is why I'm feeling a lot better than I should be on my third day.

Anyway, physical cravings are petty much gone; haven't had one yet today and whatever I had yesterday was minor and brief. Which is great, but on a certain level it doesn't feel like I have anything to fight against anymore. At least when I felt like complete shit I could grit my teeth and know that I'm beating the addiction, but without that it's a lot easier for me to start down the "one couldn't hurt" road that made me relapse my first time. I guess I'm mostly posting just to reinforce to myself that not having to deal with cravings is what normal people go through, and the hardest part has passed, and if I know I don't want to die a smoker I definitely don't want to have to deal with withdrawal again. 

So keep strong you guys! If people could found the US without toilets, we can do normal shit without tobacco.

First day back to school, first day I'll be a non-smoking university student!

Obviously study related cigarettes have been a huge part of my college life but I'm really excited to do it without them this year! I quit over the summer and I am feeling strong and ready to not be stinking of cigarettes in class! Cheers to all of us doing things we thought we could never do without those little bastards all on our own! Stay strong y'all!

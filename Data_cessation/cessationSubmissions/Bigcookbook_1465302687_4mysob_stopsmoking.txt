Getting better

I want to thank everyone who reached out time with such wise and kind advice from the bottom of my heart. You are truly helping me get through this process of escaping smoking. I'm on page 60 of Allen Carr's book and its wonderful. I smoked only 6 yesterday (down from a pack). I planon4 today a d finishing the book. Hope to start at 0 tomorrow! With support from you guys I know I can  do this!

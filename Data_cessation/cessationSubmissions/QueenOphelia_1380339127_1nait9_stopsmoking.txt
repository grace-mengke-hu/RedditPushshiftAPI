on Day Six of no smokes, needing help

why did I quit: i didnt' really like it, smelled and tasted gross, but i kept at it cos it made me feel a bit better and I work in manufacturing where everyone and their mother smokes at every break, everywhere.

I stopped working due to an injury- no income, no smokes

boyfriend HATES that I smoke(d) we are in a rough patch, it would be good for me to quit

I have a nearly 2y/o (didn't smoke thru pregnancy) and need to be healthy for him

problems now: EATING!!! I always want to eat, how do I curb this? I'm trying to just stick to chewing gum (regular gum) but my jaw is KILLING me, and it kinda makes me a wee nauseous.

don't laugh: i also blow bubbles, I get the back n forth hand motion and the exhalation. it actually helps a little bit during the stressful moments inspiration for this idea [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1mkf8i/reddit_what_is_one_double_standard_that_is/cca61vy) 

whats the take on e-cigarettes here?

also- I have problems telling some people that I quit because they GUSH! mostly family, its annoying, I did it, great, lets move on, its like they more they talk the more I want to light one up in front of them. Am i alone here? I feel like their almost rubbing my bad choices in my face from their high horse (this is especially true for an Aunt who recently quit)

EDIT: I was a 3-4pk/week smoker

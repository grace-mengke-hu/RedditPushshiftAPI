when do you need less encouragement from your support systems?

I've been sending supportive messages to someone who just quit because I want to help them stay quit. I have been doing it everyday for a month and I thought I would stop there and then just send them messages every few days or on milestones or something but now I am not sure. I don't want to bring the thought of smoking back to them if they get to a point where it wasn't there in the first place, but honestly that's probably not the first month anyway. 

At what point in quitting would something like that become annoying to you? I want to bring daily encouragement not annoyance.

A pretty overlooked barrier to quitting, IMO

I live in New Zealand, and our government is currently pushing really hard to get people to stop smoking.

But I think they overlooked the fact that cigarettes come in a pack of 20 at minimum.

Today after a week or so smokefree, I just needed a damn smoke. I went around a couple shops and asked if they sold those disposable vapes but they're all nicotine free. Ah well, guess I'll buy a pack of 20, even though I just need the one smoke.

Oh look, now I have 20 smokes, well they were expensive due to the ridiculous tax, so I may as well smoke them, right?

You used to be able to buy single cigarettes from the dairy but the government cracked down on that a few years ago.

I have a doctors appointment coming up anyway so I'm going to ask about nicotine gum or something like that but yeah, just something I thought I'd share.

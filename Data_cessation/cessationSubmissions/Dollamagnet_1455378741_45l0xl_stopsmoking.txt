LPT: Stop drinking for the first month that you quit smoking

This is the only way I was able to quit. I would always slip up in the past when I tried to quit and it was ALWAYS when I had been drinking. After a month of not drinking, I could drink and the urge was still there but manageable and not so overwhelming.

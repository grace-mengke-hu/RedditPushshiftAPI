Woohoo 3 weeks!

I've been a non-smoker for 3 weeks now and I feel great! I quit on such a whim which is kind of weird because I always thought I would plan out and decide when I wanted to quit. I was browsing askreddit and someone posted about wanting to quit and was asking for advice on what had worked for people. Several people mention Allen Carr's book and this subreddit. I checked out the book and found the pdf and read it in 2 days and then I quit smoking and joined this subreddit. 

It's honestly been really easy for me. Now that I have the right mindset about it, it makes a HUGE difference. I guess I was never a severe addict, I still smoked like 15-20 cigs a day for almost 11 years but I could go hours without having one while I was at work and be fine with it. I didn't really like smoking and was kind of embarrassed about it so I would smoke more at home or with smoker friends but didn't like the looks from strangers and didn't like certain people knowing I smoked. This helped me realize how dumb it was that I was still smoking. So I read the book and quit no problem. 

The first week I had cravings, but it was more like oh I'd normally have a cigarette right now and then I would just do something else and the thought would pass. I hung out and drank with my smoker friends, went outside with them when they smoked and I was perfectly fine with it, didn't cave and didn't really have any urge to. I also started eating better and working out and I just have more energy in general. I feel so happy and healthy, it's awesome! The only thing I still have now is dreams in which I smoke a cigarette. Even in the dream I regret smoking it and I wake up almost like what did I do? Did I smoke? Then I realize it was a dream and all is fine! 

Sorry this turned into quite a rant but thought I would share my story so far! I'm looking forward to not smoking for the rest of my life :)

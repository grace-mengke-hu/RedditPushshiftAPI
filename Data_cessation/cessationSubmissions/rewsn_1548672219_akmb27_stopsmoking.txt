Smoking alternatives when taking a break in bar/club and going for a fresh air

So here's the deal. I'm social night smoker for 10years, and passive smoker from time to time alone on my own. I quit passive smoking like half year ago. Havent socialized yet a lot, but it's likely im going out this week to the bar with friends. I dont like monotony, that's why i used to stand up and go outside for a smoke. now If im quiting I shouldnt. But i know myself, I will not be able to sit near the table for hours and watch people going for a smoke and having their own freedom of choice to be dynamic in the bar area, so I was thinking why should i sit the whole time? I can also leave to yard with smokers but don't smoke. But this one is hard as all the smoke hits me and i get the pleasure feeling of smoking.... ech. My question, whats the alternative the minute i feel I'm up for a smoke I go outside and what i do? eating candys? just breathing air (im afraid to that alone as im massive overthinker)? any suggestions? I believe if find anything im strong enough to change.

After quitting smokes 3 years ago, today’s day one of quitting vaping.

Today sucks, but I know it will get easier.  I’ve found my self having inner justifications for continued vaping (just vape when you drink, don’t vape at work, only in AM and PM).

The cravings suck, but I’ve been going outside to suck on on a pen and inhale deep.

I want to give in sooooooo bad, but I’m not going to.  I can’t.

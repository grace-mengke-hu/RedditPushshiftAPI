Currently smoking what I hope is my last cigarette!

Well, I have never really made a resolution and I have attempted to quit in the past, somewhat successfully for a few years or so but I guess you can't call that successfully quit, I guess I just took a sabbatical if you will LOL... I truly want to stop, I need to stop, and with the support of this sub Reddit and everything else I can get my hands on, I hope to make this a resolution I will keep for the rest of my life. Happy New Year's \StopSmoking, hopefully you hear from me a lot, talk to you soon, Good Night!

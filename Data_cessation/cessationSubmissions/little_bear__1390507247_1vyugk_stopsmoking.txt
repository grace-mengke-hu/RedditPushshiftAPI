Looking for advice on combatting depression related to quitting.

I smoked what I thought would be my last cigarette on January 3rd. I decided to quit cold turkey with my boyfriend, also a very heavy smoker, and it was surprisingly easy at first. Those "3 days of hell" everyone talks about were only a sort of minor inconvenience for me. I didn't notice it at first, but my mood started to change dramatically over the last few weeks. It started with lethargy and lack of motivation and has quickly spiraled into intense feelings of worthlessness/meaninglessness and thoughts of suicide. I'm a melancholy person but this intensity of feeling is just not like me. I find myself on the verge of tears at all random times of the day and slipping into deep self-loathing over the simplest thing, like not being able to find something. I am, in fact, tearing up as I'm writing this right now. 

Add on the fact that I'm a southerner currently living in a freezing arctic wasteland of a town where the sun never shines, and I can't do any of the things I love to do without becoming a human icicle. I have very few friends up here as well, and absolutely zero *good* friends with whom I can discuss these sorts of things. My boyfriend is currently working on the other side of the country and will not be back until March. I smoked yesterday and the day before just because I couldn't take feeling this way anymore.

So my question is: Should I go about this differently? I have been thinking about trying to slowly wean myself off instead of the cold turkey thing(I went from 20 a day to 0). I'm worried I'm trying to make excuses for myself to just keep smoking but I also wonder if now is the right time in my life to quit(specifically the winter and the absence of an immediate support system). Or if anyone has any tips on how to cope with this kind of depression, I would really really appreciate it.

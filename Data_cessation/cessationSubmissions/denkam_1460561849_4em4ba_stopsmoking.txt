finally picked a quit date - again - and it's going to stick this time!

so a few months back I had decided on quitting smoking - and I made it just about three full weeks without any cigarettes at all and it felt really good. well one of those nights i had been drinking and decided - hey i could have one - so i did. eventually of course and before i knew it - was back to my old habits - about a pack a day give or take. i am now to the point where i really can't stand them anymore, again - so my last day is going to be saturday, so i can spend sunday cleaning my car and doing stuff outside. it's going to stick this time. i am looking forward to actually feeling better again - improved breathing and not smelling like a damn cigarette. anyhow - advice or tips or thoughts would be much appreciated. thanks people.

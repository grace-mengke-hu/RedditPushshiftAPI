This place is kinda psyching me out

I joined this community around a year ago during my last quit. Needless to say, that quit didn't stick, but I stuck around in hopes that it would encourage me to quit again. Quitting is always in the back of my mind, as it probably is for most smokers, but for the past month or so, i've been getting really frustrated with myself for continuing the habit for obvious reasons (energy levels and money being the biggest ones at this moment). I've read Allen Carr and talked to several friends and I absolutely know I'll be better for it in the end and so forth, like I get why I need to do this. And I also get that this community is often a support system for people currently going through a quit.

But shit man, almost every post I see on here makes me scared to quit. People discussing their withdrawals, their anxiety and cravings even months afterward, etc. Every once in a while a post about how much better someone feels, but for the most part it's a lot of people talking about how hard quitting is. Again, this makes sense, but I feel like it's scaring me more than it's encouraging me. I work pretty high stress jobs and most of the folks in my industry smoke and meanwhile I'm freelance so I can't afford to be cranky or to take time off to quit or to be any more stressed than I already am or to be in any way unpersonable, twitchy, anxious, etc. 

Basically I really want to do this but I'm fucking scared and seeing this stuff on my feed is making me more scared and I know it's no one's fault apart from the tobacco, but every day I keep wanting to stop and then being like "shit, not today, I'm not ready, I have to get shit done"

I don't know. I don't really have a question, I just had to say that. I'm not trying to blame this community for my continued smoking, but seeing what a hard time everyone is having (and knowing how hard a time I've had several times before) is really psyching me out.

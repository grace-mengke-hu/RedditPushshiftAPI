This is my first hurricane as a non smoker

And I am pretty happy about that.  I mean,  this is the kind of stress that kinda makes me crave one a little BUT I am also free of the stress of trying to find somewhere safe to smoke during the worst of it.  And I didn't have to buy a carton so i saved money.  ;)

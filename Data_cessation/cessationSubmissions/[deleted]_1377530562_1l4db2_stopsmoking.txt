Other little known books? (not Allan Carr´s)

I tried with Carr´s book but I didn´t succeed to quit this horrible addition. I´d like to find a book that explain me why a normal person decide to keep smoking even if he knows that is a stupid behavior. I don´t mind if the book is obscure, little known, outdated or complex. Maybe the book doesn´t deal directly with the smoking addiction but with other addiction or is more a philosophical or psychological book. Any suggestions?

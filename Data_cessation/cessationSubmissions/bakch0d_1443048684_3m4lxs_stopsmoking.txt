6 Months !

If I did it then you can too. Just have faith in yourself, its only a habit and you kick it.  To keep everyone motivated I am listing a few benefits that I personally noticed:

* Breathing is so much easier, taking a deep breath does not hurt anymore. 

* Inside of mouth just feels super clean.

* Clothes, hands and off-course the car does not reek of smoke. 

* Climbing a flight of stairs is easier. Running a block is easier, I generally feel more energetic. 

* Food tastes so much better. 

And yes, it does get easier after a first few days and a lot easier to resist the urge after a few weeks. So keep it at. Once again, many thanks to this great community.

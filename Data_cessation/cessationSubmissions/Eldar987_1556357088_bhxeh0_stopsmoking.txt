Need some advice

Hello everyone, long time lurker. Let's jump into it.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been off smokes for awhile now, I switched to 24mg Vape juice and a vape pen to replace "Pack-a-day" Marlboro Red 100's. Over the last 2 months I have worked myself down to 3mg Nicotine. I'm RIGHT there, I want to quit I really do. I'm having a hard time giving up the 3mg and going straight and narrow. I'm doing good, I go a long time without touching the pen (Even while drinking). It's much more of reflex at this point then craving. How do I get over the hump and ditch it?

About a week and a half...

Smoked for about 3 years, stopped over a week ago. No cough, lungs feel a little heavy, but my main issue is when I wake up my tongue is coated in a brown/black mucus that takes multiple scrapes to get off has this happened to anyone else? 
Also alcohol seems to make my heart rate go nuts. Maybe my body is expecting the nicotine? Like most, I used to smoke almost every time I drank

Thanks and good luck to everyone else.

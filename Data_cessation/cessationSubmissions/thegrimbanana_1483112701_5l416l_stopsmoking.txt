To all of you out there who are wondering if you can do it

Ok, so I was just going through my post history randomly and I found some of my entries here. I also took one look at my flair (911 days) and felt goddamned amazing. 

I was torn at day 20, and at day 40 or something, I had lots of cravings, lots of self-doubts and horrible moments, but guys, I made it to 911 days. So if you're wondering if you can do it, believe me, you can. It's not an easy path, but it's doable. It gets easier every day, every month, every year. Stay vigilant even after years of quitting (it's easy to relapse even after 5 years), but know that it won't be such a pain in the ass forever. 

And this subreddit is amazing, thank you to all the users who contribute to this amazing community. The response I got from people here as well as reading others' experience helped me so much through the process, I can't even begin to imagine how hard it would've been to do this without them.

I don't want to smoke.

I don't have conventional cravings, but I do smoke when I drink. I've tried smoking when sober and felt physically ill (I'm happy about that). Over the previous two months, however, I've been running fifteen kilometres a week and boxing and generally not going out too much. This past week I went to a few parties and sure enough I drank and then smoked. It was never an issue, but since the whole working out thing it's starting to really bother me. Now that I want to nip this in the butt how should I go about quitting my dirty little habit?

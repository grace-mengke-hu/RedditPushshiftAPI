2 years!!!!

Today I hit two years without a cigarette. I cant beleive that I made it this far.  I quit using bupropion, and I'll be honest, I still think about smoking on a weekly basis, but the cravings are gone. I feel amazing and full of energy now and if I could go back in time I wish I never would of started in the first place.

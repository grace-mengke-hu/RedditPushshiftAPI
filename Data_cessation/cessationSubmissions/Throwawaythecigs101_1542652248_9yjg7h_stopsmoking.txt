Scared of getting lung cancer

Throwaway here. 

Like the title says I’m scared to death of getting lung cancer. I’m in my early 20s and recently quit smoking. I smoked off and on for about two years. I have probably smoked in total maybe 4 or 5 packs of cigarettes in my life and maybe 20 or 30 cigars in total. 

I don’t plan on ever lighting up again but I’m still scared to death of getting lung cancer. What do you think the chances are? Have I smoked too many cigarettes do you think? Or will I be okay? Can you give me some words of wisdom? I’m scared to death.

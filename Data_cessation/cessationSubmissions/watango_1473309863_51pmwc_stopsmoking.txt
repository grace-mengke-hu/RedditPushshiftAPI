longest 5 days ever

I got a job today! w00t!

I've been unemployed for the last couple months, was doing odd jobs and helping friends out since I left the military last fall.  Today though I landed the real deal and I am over joyed about it.  Job hunting is a mother fucker, let me tell you what.

Well after I got the news that I would start work on Monday, my mind turned to buying a pack of smokes.  Well I pushed through and resisted the urge.  It was a good reminder that its not only the bad times, its the good times that also make me want to smoke.  I have to stay vigilante

24 hours in... Starting to get those nagging thoughts.

I quit yesterday, about 25 hours ago and now I'm starting to get those little peaks of anxiety at the thought of never smoking again.

And nagging thoughts that say "maybe this is too drastic, maybe I should just have one".

Scary... I'm just gonna ride it out but it sucks.

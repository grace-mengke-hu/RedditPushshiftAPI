Quitting Smoking after nth attempt

I have tried so many times and failed. I don't seem to have the willpower to quit, but I know I have to. I would like to post my progress here everyday. Hope it is ok.

Also, how do deal with smoke urges? I get terrible urges in the morning before going to work, and at about 11 am, and after my run in the evening

Edit: I relapsed and smoked for the last couple of days. Trying again. Day 1 starts now (Dec 23).
Also, I want to know how to stay strong? I am quitting cold turkey and I don't want to use any nicotine products.

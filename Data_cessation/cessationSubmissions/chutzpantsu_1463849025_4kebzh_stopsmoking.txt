How I realised that my addiction is finally over

It was hard for me to grasp the fact that my body no longer craved nicotine on its own until I was absolutely shocked by the simplest thing two days or so ago.

After having a pretty hefty lunch I was sitting at the table, sipping coffee, reading my RSS feed, just relaxing and letting my stomach digest all I've just eaten.

And I **had no desire to rush outside for a cigarette**. Usually in moments like this my body acted completely on its own accord, demanding that I pump it full of nicotine right there and then and **I never realised how stressful this has been the entire time**.

Unlike social triggers like feeling tired/stressed out, the immediacy of such a reaction makes **its chemical nature extremely obvious**. I never wanted to deprive myself of the ability to enjoy the sweet onset of a well-deserved food coma!

What's better, is that now I realise that this situation is technically no different from any other to which my standard reaction would be to light up a cigarette.

**My addiction is gone and will not come back. All I have to deal with now is what's left of a bad habit I once used to have.** And this makes things much simpler :)

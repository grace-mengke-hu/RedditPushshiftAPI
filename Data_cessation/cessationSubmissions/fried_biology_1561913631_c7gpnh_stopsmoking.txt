Day 1 wish me luck!

So their banning smoking where I work starting tomorrow.  I decided to use this as an opportunity to quit, since I've been kicking the idea around for a few months and couldn't really find a good reason.  Over the past 3 months, in my mind, I  did nothing to prepare, other than tell myself that I could quit any time I wanted, I just didn't want to yet.  On Friday, I bought nicotine patches.  I avoided getting out of bed until lunch time Saturday, then put on my patch.  Big mistake. I already REALLY wanted to smoke, and the patch wouldn't stick. I tossed it and used a cigarette as a reward for trying,  I know, real productive. I did smoke SIGNIFICANTLY less yesterday than I do any other day, even with laying in bed most of the day, so I decided to give it another go.  

Put my patch on before bed, with a huge bandaid over it cause I ain't taking no chances, and I laid down.  Holy shit, what a ride.  I couldn't hold my eyes open (I read until I fall asleep nightly), but my brain wouldn't turn off.  It was what I imagine being in a coma would be like, I could hear everything, my mind still going, but my body wouldn't respond.   3 separate WILD dreams, the first of which was about smoking, which lemme tell ya, was real encouraging. 

Woke up earlier than usual, which is shocking, and actually felt refreshed.  So I'm taking today easy, had my morning coffee, squashed a few cravings with my quit smoking app, and have been puttering around the house doing chores listening to podcasts.  

I'm 12 hours in, not really hunkered down determined,  and not sure if I can handle another night of Mr. Toad's wild ride, but I'm willing to give it a good shot.  I've been smoking since I was 14, turning 37 on Thursday, so I guess there's never a better time than now, fingers crossed.

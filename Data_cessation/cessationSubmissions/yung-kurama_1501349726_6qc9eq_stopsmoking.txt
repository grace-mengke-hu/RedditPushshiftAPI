The nausea.

Hey all.  I've been using a Juul and smoking weed consistently for almost a year now.  I'll run through about 3/4 of a pod daily (which is about 15-16 cigs in terms of nicotine.)  I'm currently on my 5th day of a one week trip to Aruba, which I figured I would use as an opportunity to distract myself for the first week of detox.  I'm quitting nicotine cold turkey permanently and taking a week long break from weed just for the duration of my stay.  On the second night, I buckled and had a single cigarette in a bar.  My question is about the nausea that comes with the initial detox:  when the fuck will it ever stop?  I haven't been able to go out since that night.  As soon as I find myself having a drink or getting ready to go out, the nausea and acid reflux hits me like a sack of bricks, and I find myself pacing along the beach to relieve it.  I heard the nausea would persist only for 72 hours, but its been far longer.  Could that single cigarette have completely reset my timer for detox?  I'm in hell and I just want this feeling to end.

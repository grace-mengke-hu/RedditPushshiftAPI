Just turned 18. Going to try to quit.

I’ve been smoking for 2 years and especially in parties I’m a huge chain smoker. Now I know at my age this is doing a lot of damage to my body and I want it out of my life but I have quite an addiction prone personality and quite deep in nicotine addiction.

I’m motivated and believe myself that I can do this.

Would love some advice on how to deal with withdrawals and temptations if anyone has similar experience. Also is it a smart idea quitting cold turkey or would it be smarter gradually starting to smoke less? (Usually smoke about around 6 cigarettes a day)

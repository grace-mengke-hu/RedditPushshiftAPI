I'll do it again

Yeah! I'll do it again. Thanks for your support guys, but I didn't make it.

I still would like to do it. Have been smoking for 12 years or so, basically I started as soon as I was eligible to buy smokes. Quited few times for 3 to 6 months. Now I want to quite forever. Before I couldn't imagine my life without smokes, but now I think I'm ready.

I don't think somebody can help me, except you guys. I'll try to post here daily and see whats gonna happen.

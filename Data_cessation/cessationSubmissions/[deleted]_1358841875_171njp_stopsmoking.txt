What do you regret most about smoking cigarettes?

I smoked cigarettes in the presence of my daughter who was born with Tetralogy of Fallot (4 heart defects), later suffered from congestive heart failure and died at age 10. I even read her bedtime stories and said her evening prayers with a cigarette in hand. Years following her death, I refused to stop smoking and would tell myself and others, "I did not stop for her. Why should I stop for me?"

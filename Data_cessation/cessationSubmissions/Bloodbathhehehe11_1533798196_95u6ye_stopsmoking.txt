Caught myself trying to talk me into having a smoke.

I quit yesterday. Just sitting and working when I had this intense craving and I took a tea break. But I caught myself having a dialogue in my head like "it's fine you can always start the quit again. Don't worry just one is fine in the entire day. Relax it's fine to have one"

NO NO NO NO NO. I know I want to not smoke.. So I'm Going to do just that. 

I distracted myself by reading posts here. It's really helpful. Keeping busy is also the key and timely triggers is what sets it off I guess.

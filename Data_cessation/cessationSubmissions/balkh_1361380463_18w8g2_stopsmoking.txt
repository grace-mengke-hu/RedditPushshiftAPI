Feeling terrible ... :\

Wow, I'm only on day two and I feel absolutely horrible! Last night I could barely sleep, I kept waking up randomly... I feel like I've been hit by a truck ... achy, feverish, sore throat. I keep hacking up phlegm... but I know all this is going to pay off. I can't smoke again. I won't smoke again. Good luck to everyone else quitting out there!

Day 14 and my brain feels fried

14 days cold turkey. I want this. This is it. I don’t want to be a smoker anymore. But the last 72 hours have been a damn rollercoaster. Im dealing with a low-key heartache situation right now and I cant even tell if I’m more sad about that or the fact that I cant smoke to deal with it. I haven’t given in and I wont... but today I cried in the parking lot at yoga because my best friend wasn’t comprehending a text I sent. What the hell is happening up there?

2 years of damage done, I'm scared to bits

Hi everyone 

I've been a lurker. I've been trying to quit. But I just haven't been able to do it. It doesn't probably help that there's always some weed nearby and tobacco in abundance. 

Recently I saw black patches on the sides of my tongue and I got the scare of my life. 

If I don't stop inhaling tobacco, I'm going to end up with oral cancer. And I'm just 23!

I can't. I can't. I can't. I refuse to. I can't believe all this happened. I never had any drug addiction be it alcohol weed cigarettes. 

It all started after I quit my job and started my own company. But I know, that's a lame excuse, but it happened and now I'm in deep shit. After starting my company, my once in a month smoking when drinking because 2-5 cigarettes a day and try as I might, I haven't been able to get it down. 

Looking at everyone in this community inspires me. I shall do my best. Tobacco has to leave my life. 

Now. 

There's someone I love and I want to live a long, long life. I'm selfish that way but I'm okay with being selfish. For my selfishness to win, tobacco has to lose. 

Give me your blessings.

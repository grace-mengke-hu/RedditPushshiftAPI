Well..... I did it.

I made it all night out drinking without a cigarette, and believe me... there was temptation. First, my boyfriend (who quit with me) found a cigarette pack, with TWO cigarettes in them..... I even smelled it and put it in my mouth. Didn’t light it. Then got to the bar, started drinking, and the person next to me (who was with us) lit a cigarette. She smoked 3 cigarettes next to me. Didn’t have one......

Now, I’m home, drunk as heeeeell and I didn’t have a cigarette tonight despite the serious temptations. I  know I will be more happy tomorrow when I’m sober that I did not give in and have a cigarette.

4 Years Quit After 40+ Years Smoking

My daughter just reminded me today marks 4 years.  1461 days.  I smoked for 40+ years, not heavily at first but at the end up to a pack and half a day.  Even though I was otherwise healthy—good diet and moderate exercise—I was a cougher, a wheezer, and easily winded because of my love, cigarettes.  Oh I did love cigarettes and if I could smoke them without the consequences I would!  

The hardest part of quitting was the associations.  The psychological addiction was 1000% percent more difficult to overcome than the actual drug addiction (nicotine). I had associated every aspect of my waking life with cigarettes.  Mornings?  Coffee or tea and smokes.  Work breaks? Smokes.  After eating: smokes.  Before getting on board: smokes.  After disembarking: smokes.  Out in nature enjoying a view: smokes.  Party with friends: smokes.  Camping out: smokes.  Sitting around the fireplace: smokes... you get the idea.  

Well all that's gone now.  It took some time and effort, I went cold turkey. I would say that at about 400 days or so I was victorious.  

Most of all I post this to provide encouragement to anyone who has quit, is trying to quit or is thinking about quitting.  It's totally a personal decision, but I can share that quitting has given me a new lease on life and life can truly be great without the smokes.  Even greater.

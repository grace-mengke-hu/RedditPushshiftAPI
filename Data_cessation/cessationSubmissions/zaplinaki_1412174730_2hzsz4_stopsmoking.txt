Day 3 and I'm going strong.

I have posted in this subreddit before about quitting but I could never go forward with it until the day before yesterday. I just couldn't smoke anymore - the minute I took a drag I felt this immediate pain in my throat and a disgust for what I was doing. I threw away the cigarette and I haven't even thought about smoking since then. I think this might be it although I have a tough 4 days coming (going on a trip with friends to drink - literally) but I am sure that I will resist. Thank you for the inspirational stories guys; I'm not lying when I say that they helped. I'll update this post 4 days later to tell you that I didn't smoke :)

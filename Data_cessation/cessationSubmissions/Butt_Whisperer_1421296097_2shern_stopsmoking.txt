I almost caved today.

Had a really stressful morning, and spent a good hour in my room crying. I was so, so close to buying another pack. I thought, *the gas station is right down the street. I could have a pack in 2 minutes...* 

But I didn't. And I actually feel pretty fucking proud of myself. I experience a significant amount of stress in my life, and I knew the first stressful event since quitting would be my first test. I'm actually in a bit of disbelief, like I can't believe I had it in me to say no. It's awesome.

For the first time in a very long time, cigarettes weren't dictating how I dealt with my emotions or reacted to stress. It's a new feeling, but it's a great feeling. I hope I can keep it going.

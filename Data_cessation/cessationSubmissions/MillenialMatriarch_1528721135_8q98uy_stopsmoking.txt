Time to refocus... any tips?

So I gave myself a lot of leeway and grace in the past almost 3 weeks. Sleeping in, eating whatever I felt like, cancelling plans with friends at the last minute, and doing just the bare minimum at work.

I know it's okay in these early days to re prioritize that limited energy, but I've got to get back to normal productivity. Otherwise I risk slipping into a depressive state and that would be no good.

DAE feel like life stopped for the quit and needed a kickstart? How'd you do it?

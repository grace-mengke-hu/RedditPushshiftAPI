Quitting!!!!

Trying to quit after 13 years of smoking. Never imagined that is was going to be this hard. I am using nicotine patches they are seeming to help , but the cravings , I can't belive how much this effects me. I amean so mad at myself for ever starting. I need this I have 5 children that I need to be around for , wishlist would have never started smoking in the first place!!!

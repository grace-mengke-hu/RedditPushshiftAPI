He says he's trying, but what can I do to help him quit?

My boyfriend picked up smoking this summer and has been trying to quit for a couple of months now. He knows I want him to quit. My dad has been smoking for 40 years and it's had a huge impact on his health. My boyfriend is in his early 20's and I don't want to see him do that to his body, plus he smells like smoke no matter what he does to hide it and that is *such* a turnoff for me. I ask him about how he's doing with quitting, but it's always the same, "I'm trying to." I know quitting is hard. Like I said, my dad has had quintuple bypass and we still can't get him to stop. Is there anything I can do to support my boyfriend and help him to quit? Is it better or worse for me to bring it up? I don't want to nag, but at the same time, I know how bad it is for him. Any help would be appreciated! :)

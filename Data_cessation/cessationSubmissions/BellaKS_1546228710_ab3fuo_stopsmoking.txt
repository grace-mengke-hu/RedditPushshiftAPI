So day 4 is closing

Day 4 is closing and I'm not really worried......I'm actually feeling ummmm super happy....which is scary.

This morning woke up depressed

I was fine

4 hours later depressed

I am fine

Now getting pretty dang happy! I can't stop smiling while watching the french revolution by the BBC.
Again another day I can not sit still at all. Even when I lay back and my body is still, my head has to keep going back/forth/back/forth. Also I'm not even worried right now that I'm out of spironolactone till THURSDAY! Guess what it does....helps with my hormonal imbalance and keeps my high blood pressure under control AND I'M NOT WORRIED!

Some one told me it's all in my head, my bipolar fear of my mood swings getting out of control, they told me that right here and I guess they were right. I'm not worried even though I'm cycling reallllllly bad today.....haven't done this in years.  I got enough energy now I really wanna go out to eat, play catopoly, maybe reclean the house even though I already did it, and well Idk.

My ESA kitty Fuji....yeah he's laying right down flat on me! lol he's cute but he does this to let people know I'm manic now. I already know I'm manic but it's a dang great feeling I wish I had more of this.

After last week's cigarette

I haven't smoked again. I feel really lucky in that it hasn't given me any physical cravings - not that it didn't play with my mind a bit. 

For those of you who don't know me, it would have been 2 years this summer. 

The evening after I smoked, and the next 2 days, I had a raging headache, and my throat is still sore. 

My skin broke out into spots.

I've felt low in energy ever since. 

Hope this helps someone!!!

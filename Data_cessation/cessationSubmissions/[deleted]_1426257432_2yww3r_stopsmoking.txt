Used my last $10 to buy a book instead of a gram

I'm a 17 year old weed addict who smokes a few times a day. After keeping track of my spending on weed for the last 5 months, I realized I spent double of what I earned working during that time period. My memory is horrible, I binge eat, I have permanent bags under my eyes, I've fallen into a deep depression and my anxiety has heightened. After not smoking for almost a week I started going crazy and needed my fix. I only had $10 left until I received my next pay check. I called my dealer and was on my way to pick up when I had a breakdown. The sudden realization that if I never started smoking, I probably would have been accepted to college, I wouldn't have rebelled and forced my parents to kick me out. I passed by an indigo (Canadian bookstore) and bought a book instead. It's a small step, but it made me feel soo much better.

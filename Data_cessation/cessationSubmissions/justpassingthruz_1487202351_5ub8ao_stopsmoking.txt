Valentine's day gift

I gave myself the gift of health for Valentine's day. Today is my first day of my quit. I must say its been tough today. Keeping mints at hand when I get cravings help, I take one and take deep minty breaths. I've always been afraid of the weight gain when quitting, but this time I said screw it, I'm quitting no matter what. Like I said, I keep stopping myself from hopping into the car and buy new smokes, just keep plugging away when having a craving.

My thoughts on quitting

So I've been vaping for about 2 months now, but I still have a smoke now and then.  

I think a lot of the problem is people covet that QUIT DATE so much that once they have another one, they throw in the towel.  I've probably smoked a pack in the past 2 months but I'm ok with that... because I'm not smoking every 2 hours on the hour like a mad man. 

I think if you just stopped focusing on how long you've been without a cigarette, you'd be less reminded on how long you've been without a cigarette, and thus more successful.  I duno.

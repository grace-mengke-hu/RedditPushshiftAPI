Sick? Perfect time to quit!

It's Fall, and with the changing weather comes the unavoidable cold.  If you already feel crappy, what's a little nicotine withdraw on top?  The typical cold/flu last 2-5 days, about how long it takes to get through the worst few days of nic-withdraw and cravings.  Being sick is also a good excuse for the inevitable grumpiness that sets in a day after that last smoke.  Worked for me!  Been a week now smoke free :D

St Paddy's Day temptation - anyone got a strategy to stay quit?

Hey all!  So, St Patrick's Day is this Sunday, a great excuse for many to get drunker than normal.  A friend of mine is having an all day kegger on Saturday, so I know temptation is going to be at an all time high.  
I am considering writing on a green shirt in permanent marker instructions to not give me any cigarettes, and maybe a punishment on the back if anyone sees me smoking?  
Not going to let a stinkin' bender get in the way of my quit, but it's key to be prepared.  Any tips?

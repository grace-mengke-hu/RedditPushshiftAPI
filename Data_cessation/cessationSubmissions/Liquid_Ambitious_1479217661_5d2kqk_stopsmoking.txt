Planning to quit smoking.

Hello guys! On this friday I'm planning to quit smoking, I like to work out alot, I workout 1 hour everyday, and do yoga 1 hour a day, but I started feeling tired while i workout thats why am planning to quit, I have some questions, I used to smoke Marlboro Silver which is 3 nicotine, 4 tar and 5 carbon, I smoke 8 cigarettes a day, been smoking since I was 16 I am 18 now, would it be easier for me to quit? Do I have to reduce first then quit?, another question,  I dont want to gain weight.... should I increase my workout, and what type of food should I eat for nicotine craving, last question, I have practical driving test,  which is on after two weeks, should I wait till I take my driving licence to quit? Because I really want to be concentrated to pass, I dont want to fail....
  

Thank you.

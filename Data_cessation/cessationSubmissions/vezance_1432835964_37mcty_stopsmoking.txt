Day 4... Almost became day 0

I have had the narrowest escape I've ever had. I had been going strong so far. Then today I had a couple of beers, got with a girl, and soon I thought I would have 'just one cigarette'. 

On my way home I actually asked the cab to stop at a shop. He passed one and said he would stop at the next. I said OK. He stopped at the next and I said, 'keep driving my favorite shop is up ahead.' All the time, I was telling myself I shouldn't be doing it. And at the same time convincing myself one wouldn't hurt.

I got off the cab close to my place, change ready in hand for the cigarette. I don't know what changed my mind at the last moment but I walked right past the shop and kept walking. I walked to my home, change still in hand. The day is almost over and I am about to sleep now. 

I'm sorry this sounds like a 'dear diary' post but I think the encouragement I've received here, and the stories I have heard here, were the only reasons I had the courage to walk home smoke-free today. 

I'll be facing my fifth day tomorrow.

Will this hurt my progress?

Okay, so let me get this out of the way before I go on. Marijuana is **not** addictive. If you believe marijuana is addictive, you are a moron. There is a very weak argument to be made for psychological addiction, but **you cannot become physically addicted to marijuana, end of story**. **Either way**, I have no problems with smoking marijuana, and I have found it incredibly easy to simply stop smoking marijuana for long periods of time, with no tapering. Some people will say that I am simply replacing nicotine with something else. I don't care. Frankly, I think smoking marijuana is good for you, and I think it would be an incredibly effective way to help me quit smoking cigarettes. If you disagree, we need to agree to disagree, because if you respond on the flawed assumption that marijuana is addictive or inherently bad, you will have satisfied but one objective: spreading misinformation with your self-righteousness and wasting my time. In any event, you will have not answered my question or my concerns. Please forgive my brashness in writing this disclaimer, but I am, in fact, 36 hours in and *irritable*. Besides, I have no time for the racist and backwards ideology touted by anti-marijuana "activists".

However, there is a small concern in smoking marijuana while I am trying to quit. I normally smoke by rolling "spliffs", which is a joint rolled with a small amount of tobacco. The amount of tobacco in a spliff is equivalent to about a fifth of a cigarette. I do this because it makes the spliff a lot more consistent (in terms of the way it burns) and allows me to use significantly less marijuana in each spliff. I do not in any way feel that if I smoke such a spliff, I will crave another cigarette, and since my only motivation for quitting smoking is the cost (and, not that this is all too important for me at this very moment, but the health risk associated with such a small amount of tobacco must surely be negligible), I do not feel as if I will have failed myself by smoking a spliff. On the contrary, I feel as though smoking marijuana in general will greatly reduce my cravings and help me get through the rough week ahead.

**tl;dr:** That said, **here is the big question**: will smoking a small amount of tobacco, equivalent to about one-fifth of a cigarette no more than once a day, "reset" my withdrawal progress? In other words, I feel that after 72 hours of cessation, the worst will be over, and after 2 weeks, my concentration will go back to normal. If I smoke this small amount of tobacco in this context, will that disrupt this progress? If I smoke this amount, will it be another 72 hours until the withdrawal subsides from the time I smoke a spliff, or will it have a smaller, or nonexistent impact on my withdrawal period? Again, I am **not** concerned that this will cause me to relapse, but only that this will undo my progress.

For your consideration: from what I know, nicotine causes your brain to produce less dopamine, since you're getting it from the nicotine. After quitting, your brain gradually turns that production back on over time. Since that "shutting down" of dopamine production occurs due to a familiarity with large amounts of daily nicotine, I am tempted to assume that such a small amount of nicotine would not "change my mind", and that regardless, my brain will continue to respond to a shortage of dopamine and continue gradually producing more regardless, hence minimally reducing disruption in the "withdrawal rebuilding process".

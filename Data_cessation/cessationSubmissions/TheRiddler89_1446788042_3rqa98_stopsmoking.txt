Today is the day!

I have tried to quit smoking many times in the past 5 years and today I have finally decided that today is the day. I started smoking working at a bar to take an extra break here and there. Never thought anything of it at the time but after 5 years of being a smoker spending thousands of dollars, no make that wasting thousands of dollars I needed to stop! I am doing this not only for myself but all of my family and friends that urged me to stop. I always felt a pressure from my family and friends especially my father who smoked for 20 years before quitting now that I am fully putting my support mentally behind this I feel for the first time since I started smoking that I can now do it! After reading some posts here I feel that I am not alone. Fuck smoking I am done with  you!

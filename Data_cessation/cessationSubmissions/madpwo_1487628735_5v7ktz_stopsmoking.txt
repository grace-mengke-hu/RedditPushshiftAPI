Dad has been smoke free for 5 years now!

My das was my hero when I was growing up. He taught me everything I know about music, how to play the trumpet, and was the coolest. He also smoked, and of course I never thought anything about it, until one day the coughing got so bad he had to quite. He couldn't play trumpet. He didn't play trumpet for 10 years. As I got better I could tell he was proud, but sad he couldn't be there with me. He finally decided to quit 5 years ago today! He's slowly been playing trumpet again and has been getting healthier! I'm so happy my hero can play again!

Today is Day One and I hate everything, but it will be OK

Smoked my last cigarette last night around 9 p.m. I've held strong all day today and am starting to get that antsy, angry, I'mma-kill-someone feeling already. But I know it will pass. It's been 15 hours since I smoked and I can make it another 15. I'll just be a little ball of rage in the corner in the meantime.

Had a hiccup but I think it only made me want to quit more.

I had a really shitty day last week. Everyone at my office was in a bad mood about the election and took it out on the people around them, including me since I do a lot of the office management tasks around the office.

After a series of annoying events, I realized I left my purse and car keys downtown at a meeting. I had to have my boss drive me there (who used to smoke with me) and I broke down and demanded we get a pack.

I thought a cigarette would fix my problems and de-stress me. I thought it would be a nice reward for dealing with my crappy day. I thought it would evoke all the old good feelings I used to get when I smoked. Nope, it made me sick to my stomach, feel guilty, gave me a headache, etc. 

I had one and tossed the pack out. 

Now whenever I have the urge to grab a smoke when I am having a bad day, I'm reminded of how it just wasn't worth it. How smoking isn't the same anymore. It's made quitting that much easier. 

So I'm thankful I screwed up last week and I'm ready to continue on!

stopped for about 6 months, went through a breakup and picked up the habit again a few weeks ago.

Just rinsed the pack in the sink, cut it in half and threw it away. It's not doing me any favors. Ill hit some weights or do some pushups next time I get the urge. Better yourself not harm yourself. Hope I can maintain the sobriety amongst smoking friends.

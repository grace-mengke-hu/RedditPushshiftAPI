Grandma Died, Please help

Hey guys my grandma just died and I feel desperately in need of a smoke. I'm at a point where I feel confident I won't start smoking again but I know it's not right. I've got a pack of smokes in one hand and a lighter in the other and at this point i'm either going to throw the pack into the garbage or smoke it. Please help me throw it away.

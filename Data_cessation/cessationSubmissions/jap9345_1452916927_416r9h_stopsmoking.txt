Got my wisdom teeth out, quit at the same time.

So i got my wisdom teeth out yesterday morning, and i quit smoking the day before, i was given IV sedation with fentanyl and percocet for painkillers afterwards. For some reason i am not experiencing cravings as strong as before. I attempted to quit in march but failed on my second day due to cravings. I was wondering if the painkillers or fentanyl from the surgery were to change or delay my withdrawl symptoms? I have felt some cravings to go and smoke but it is something i can easilly shake off compared to last time i tried to quit. Thanks in advanced for any information

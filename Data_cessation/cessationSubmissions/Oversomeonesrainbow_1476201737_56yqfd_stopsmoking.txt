How many of you started prior to 18? How did you start?

So reading the comments from this r/showerthoughts post https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/56xh5k/tobacco_companies_should_be_leading_in_the_search/

I noticed every single comment with an age in it was <16 when they started. Is it that common to start so young? And what got you started?

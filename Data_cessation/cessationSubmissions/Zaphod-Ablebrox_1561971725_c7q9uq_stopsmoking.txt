Lapsed and pissed off...

Just done 5 days.  Just going about my day and then got a massive craving, didn’t even bother to look on here for support (although I know someone would have helped), really bloody annoyed with myself.  I was like some vagrant searching the bins for any tobacco I’d thrown out, then remembered I had some tobacco stashed in my hobby car, it had been there for over a year, “that’ll do!”  It had papers with it and some filters.  I rolled one, I didn’t make it properly on the first attempt as my fingers were shaking with the... excitement (?) of it, I had to unroll it and re-roll, that should really have been enough to tell me not to have bothered...  I am not giving up giving up, I am NOT going to have anymore.  I know I need to get through my days with temptation, I will be around others who smoke and I’m going to have to handle that in the future.

My heart is racing, I’m feeling dizzy, sick, disappointed with myself, I’m sweating.  My lungs are aching,  I can feel a little rattle in my throat when I breathe.

THIS IS NOT A GAME!

THAT IS IT!  No more - ever.

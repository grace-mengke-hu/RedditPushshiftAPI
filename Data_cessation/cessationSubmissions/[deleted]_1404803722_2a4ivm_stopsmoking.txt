I'm not a smoker, but I just want to say thank you to you all.

Last year, my dad was hospitalized. An asthmatic man who'd smoked since he was 14 and lived with cats his whole life. He nearly died. Two weeks in hospital. We don't live close to each other, and I haven't asked, but I know he still smokes. I know because when his kids were hungry, he bought a bargain pack. And, when I hugged him, despite the gum he constantly chewed, all he smelt of was smoke. And, when I cried and asked him to stop when I was a child, he waved me away.

Thank you for not being like him. It broke my heart while I was growing up. Thank you for taking the steps so you don't break someone's heart down the line. You mean something to someone. And, even if you don't think you do, you might in the future. He didn't think he'd have me when he first smoked, he wasn't thinking of the sixteen year old that would get the email that her dad was possibly dying thousands of miles away. I've never touched a cigarette in my life, and I don't know how hard it is for you right now. But, I do know that it must be pretty hard for my dad to put it before me.

Anyway, thank you.

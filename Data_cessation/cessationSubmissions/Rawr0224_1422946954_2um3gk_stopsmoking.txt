What got me through 2 years...

I had been smoking for 5 years when I first met my boyfriend. As it turns out, he was actually quite disgusted by my smoking habits, but wasn't rude about it. He wanted to help me quit, but it took me over a year to get behind quitting. I smoked 1/2 to a full pack a day and would constantly smoke in my car, before/after we saw a movie, before/after we went to a nice restaurant, any time I felt like I needed one really. After realizing my boyfriend most likely wouldn't stay with me forever if I kept up smoking, and after many, many, many failed attempts to quit, we found a system to keep me feeling like I am accomplishing something instead of losing my much enjoyed cigarette breaks. He made me badges like they do in AA, and it had a surprisingly successful outcome. Check them out [Here](http://i.imgur.com/0QSWVgy.jpg)

He started with an old poker chip set and some sharpies at first, and as I was more successful he upgraded to shrinky dinks. 2 years as of 2 days ago!

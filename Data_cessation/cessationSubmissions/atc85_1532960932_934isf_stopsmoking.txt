1 week today!

Today makes one week for me. The morning, waking up, urges are better. I didn’t want to jump up and grab one. Although last night I was ready to go to the store and buy a pack just for the one. I came here instead. I had a particularly bad day yesterday. Going to a party for my husbands family member. Since I’m his wife, was expected to do all this stuff for someone who barely speaks to me and is completely rude and self serving. I did it all. And with a smile y’all. But the resentment and anger of the entire thing has just made me really want to smoke. And very agitated. Like, I feel like I just want to be left alone. Completely alone. Like  the husband can go live with them for all I care and I just can stay here with my kids and dog. Ugh. I will not give in. I will just let it go. Fuck those ciggies!

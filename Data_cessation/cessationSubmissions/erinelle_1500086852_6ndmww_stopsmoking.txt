At a complete loss

I failed and smoked today. 

I stopped cold turkey for 2 days and the third day I've cracked. Found a pouch of roll up tobacco and gave in. 

Since the first 24 hours I've been crying and feeling on edge and taking it out on my significant other  ( he is not a smoker and hearing things like "calm down" and made to feel like "it's only in your head" only add to the frustration. ) it's not his fault, and when I snap at him I apologize and feel like a monster. It IS all in my head, I'm aware of what this monster is but it doesn't help. 

I finished Allen Carr's book and it shed a lot of insight, but regardless of knowing what my addiction is, I still am enslaved. The emotional reactions are overwhelming. I hate it because I have always had emotions in check, and this one little thing has me on my knees. I know it's a falso crutch and filthy bur I'm not deterred.
I'm desperate to stop and feel desperate for one when I do. 
It's hell. And I dont know what to do to escape. I am wondering if I need anti depressants to get over the lack of dopamine but damn I hate the thought of pills.

I've been smoking 15+ years and it seems that it's more than just a physical and mental addiction, it appears to be an emotional one as well. And even though I feel it killing me I also feel like death being deprived.

I just don't know what to do. I've never felt so hopeless about anything in my entire life.

Will I ever be able to quit?

I'm 25 and have been smoking for about 7 years. I've tried quitting multiple times and no matter what, the cravings come back and I can't resist. What makes it harder for me is that I'm prescribed adderall. Anyone who has any experience with adderall will understand how intense the cravings get. I know people will try to say to get off adderall, but I really do need it, and I'm trying to get into a very competitive nursing program. I was looking into the gradual approach to quitting and was wondering if anyone else has had success with this. I was thinking about settin a quit date a month from now and try to smoke one less per day every week until my quit date, so I would smoke 9 a day next week and 8 a day the week after and so on. Thanks guys, I'm so sick of smoking and I feel like I may never quit and it scares me.

Don't think of a pink elephant!

No, really, don't think of a pink elephant.

You're thinking of a pink elephant, aren't you?

Now imagine someone scraping a chalkboard with their fingernails. The thought alone provokes almost a physical reaction in the body, right?

Your brain is very powerful and should be used to your advantage when you're quitting smoking.

So, what happens when you're trying to quit is that you go through an internal dialogue:

- I want to smoke;

- But I can't smoke;

- But I want to smoke;

- No, you can't do it;

- But oh my goodness I want to smoke.

Sure, you *can* do it that way if you have the willpower to go through multiple internal dialogues like that per day without snapping. But it's the hard way.

Why do you think people surrender to the nicotine monster during those kind of internal dialogues? Because the brain can't process negatives. You can't *not* think of a pink elephant if asked to do so. If your internal dialogue revolves around smoking, you're going to want it.

So the next time you get a craving, replace the thought of smoking with something else and transform the inner dialogue. It can look something like this:

I want clean air.

I want freedom.

I want health.

It takes a bit of practice but makes the whole process much easier and more enjoyable.

Hope this helps.

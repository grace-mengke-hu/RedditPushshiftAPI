Tonight I fucked up... TL;DR Don't relapse.

Tonight I ended up smoking after 7 months and 8 days of quitting. The last few weeks I've been stressed, worrying about things and been depressed. Tonight I went out for a drink with friends and had someone have a negative impact on my night. I'm hoping that tomorrow when I wake up (sober) that I won't have the urge to smoke, otherwise I'll be resetting my count back to day one. (Counting it as without addiction rather than since a cig smoked.)

The Â£1000 mark that I will hit in two days will hopefully make me motivated enough to not smoke in the morning.

I just wanted to vent and to say that smoking is really not an option to rid you of the stress you're under, it's only temporary. I state this to anyone who feels in the same place as myself. 

It's only after it's done that you really feel that cigs ain't worth shit.

Here's to a better tomorrow, without fags.

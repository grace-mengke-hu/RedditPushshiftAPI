100 hours and counting.

It's been 100 hours since I smoked. My stress level has plummeted. I used to worry so much about getting home before my fiance to shower and get the smell off me. (She's allergic to the smoke and will vomit if she smells it.) Now we hang out more there's no self inflicted guilt from getting up in the middle of the night to sneak a smoke. I can focus better at work and everything is going pretty well. I still get cravings but they pass. 

I've been lurking here for some time and since yesterday was my cake day I thought I might come out of the shadows.

Thanks All!

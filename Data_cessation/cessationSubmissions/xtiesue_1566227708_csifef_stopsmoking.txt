Trying again

I keep trying to quit but my stressful job is such a trigger. I had my last cig the evening before going out of town for 4 days. It was super easy not to smoke while I was away, but now I’m home and procrastinating going to work because I always relapse during stressful times at work. I’m rejoining this group in the hope that it will help me stick with my goals.

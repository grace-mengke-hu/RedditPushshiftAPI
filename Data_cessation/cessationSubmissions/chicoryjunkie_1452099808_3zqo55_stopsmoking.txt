I'm new here.

Hey everyone, just wanted to introduce myself!

I'm 28 years old and started smoking at age 15. I quit 5 days ago. It's been really rough, especially since I've been back to work, but today I'm feeling really good and I wanted to thank everyone here for, well, being here. This forum has been a lifesaver these past 5 days.

Both of my parents smoked growing up and I hated it, until I started myself. My adolescence was so hard and cigarettes became a way to cope. Since then I've graduated college, made peace with my past, moved abroad, met and married a wonderful supportive partner, got into great shape, found a steady if not ideal job-I outgrew all of my old destructive coping mechanisms because I didn't need them anymore.  

Except for one, and it was bringing me down. I was coughing and wheezing in the morning and, this past September, was diagnosed with HPV thanks to a positive PAP smear result, which I later found out was directly linked to cigarette smoking and put me at greater risk for all sorts of cancers and other problems. 

So I quit, and I'm here doing OK, watching the minutes turn into hours and the hours turn into days. 

I'm happy to be here with you all.

How do I fill the void now that I've quit?

Hey all! I smoked cigarettes for about 2 years, then switched to electronic for the past 3 (nicotine free for 3 weeks now). I wanted to quit for me and so my family will have me around for a lot longer. The problem is that I am a naturally anxious person and vaping/smoking helped give me something to do with my hands that kept everything in check. Now that I've quit, I can't seem to find anything to scratch that itch and it's making my cravings intense to the point that it's affecting my concentration and work performance, etc...The closest I've come have been sunflower seeds and sugar free gum, but they aren't really cutting it. Any help provided is much appreciated. Thank you!

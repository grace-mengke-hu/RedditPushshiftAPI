What Smoking cessation taught me so far

So, almost a year in, and it wasn't easy. It was a hard road, but I learned so much about myself. 

- I learned that those who judge you for not smoking - and there are a few who still do it, even though they're 30 years old - are not those you want to keep close.

- I learned that I have a tendency of abusing substances, and developing dependencies to mask pain and discomfort. I noticed that in the last year, I've been starting to replace smoking (I quit drug use and drinking 6 years ago) with other addictions - porn, food, sleep - and I don't like it. I now know that I need to face discomfort on my own.

- I moved house. My dog got sick. My grandma got sick. I visited Amsterdam. I had bouts of anxiety and depression, but I didn't smoke because It wouldn't solved anything.

- After 10 years of weekly migranes, I am free. I used to pop painkillers weekly, and smoking cessation had freed me out of this burden. I got only two!

So, that's it. I still get cravings. I still fancy a smoke here and then. But I'm not going to do it, because fuck it, while my addictive brain says otherwise, I know it's the best thing I ever did.

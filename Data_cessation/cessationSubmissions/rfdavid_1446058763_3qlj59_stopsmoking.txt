Update from a year ago

I posted [this last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/1sn1ks/feel_like_bragging_a_little/) and thought it would be fun to post an update:

* Still running, just finished my second half marathon on the weekend.
* Lifting weights regularly
* Still eating healthy
* Still not smoking!

Quitting smoking was the catalyst that changed my life for the better.  Sure some days in the beginning kind of sucked; but every bit of 'hardship' has been paid back tenfold.

Stay strong quitters, it gets AWESOME!

Unplanned quit

I had a big night on Saturday that involved extended drinking and some drug use—and obviously, tons of smoking.  When I woke up in the morning on Sunday, I felt like an ashtray, as I usually do after a night like that.  As per usual, I held of smoking for the morning and the afternoon, and it just kind of kept rolling.

I'm more than 48 hours in right now and I figure I might as well just keep pushing with this.  I'm leading a 50 day canoe trip this summer and figure not having to worry about smoking during that time will be a load of my mind—not to mention my lungs.  What do you guys think?

ways to take the edge off?

I am on the worlds most terrible drug, prednisone, and normally smoking would take the edge off of some of the terrible symptoms. Obviously I have quit smoking and I do not want to go back. Does anyone have any ideas on things I can do (especially on work breaks) to keep my self from flipping out? Think pms*10000 for a rough idea of how I feel. I kind of want to kill anything that moves. Also gum doesn't help me out because I have TMJ issues.

Thanks so much for the help.

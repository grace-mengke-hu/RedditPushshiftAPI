Tomorrow is the day!

Well, tomorrow is the day I become a non smoker.

I have been taking chantix and have not experienced any side effects which is super awesome. I'm feeling extremely confident that I can do this!!

Any suggestions on taking the next few days/months/years?

 I have read tons of posts on here and I want to be well stocked with ammunition to beat this nicotine addiction. I know that what works for one may not work for all, but I'm determined to be a non smoker.

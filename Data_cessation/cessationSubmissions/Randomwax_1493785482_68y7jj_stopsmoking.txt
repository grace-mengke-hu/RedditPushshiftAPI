Quitting smoking and ADHD / Ri

Hi guys,
I quit smoking 2 weeks ago.

I've been having mood swings where I go into a dazed funk where I can't focus on anything, feel heavy and like I can't talk. Even marginally confused which is scary.

I was feeling fine today and then I took my Ritalin and within minutes I went into one of these dazes. I'm wondering if the Ritalin is causing them.

I take 10mg 3x a day and wondered why I was feeling so crap then feeling fine then crap. 5mg used to put me to sleep is it possible the Ritalin is causing these 'dazes' and I need to change dosage up or down because I quit smoking? Or is it just withdrawal.

TL;DR Quit smoking and now feel dazed when I take Ritalin (I think it's the Ritalin). Do I need a dosage adjustment or is it all just part of withdrawal?

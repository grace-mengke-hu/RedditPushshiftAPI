I don't believe that I can quit :(

I've tried so, so, so many times and I've only been smoking since April 2012. I don't know if the length of time smoking even has anything to do with it but every time I attempt to quit, I will always have an overwhelming urge to smoke the next day, first thing in the morning.

I've read Allen Carr's book, I KNOW that smoking does nothing but bad things for me, it still doesn't magically destroy the cravings.

Fuck.

Thirty year old taking college courses going to quit

I'm a student at my local community college. I'm going to be thirty in a couple months and have been smoking for about 10 years consistently. I made the deans list last semester and I'm making all A's so far in my classes with little more than 7 weeks left.

And I'm going to attempt to stop tobacco, cold turkey. Jesus Christ, what am I doing? Im afraid that I wont be able to concentrate and keep up my good grades without tobacco. I know its completely up to me and that no one is responsible except me. I just needed to tell someone, anyone, even if just a few strangers on reddit. Motivating thoughts? Encouraging words? Thanks for listening.

Involuntarily quit smoking. Didn't think it would be this hard.

It's been two weeks since my last cigarette. I'm 21 and I was a two-year pack a day smoker, so not as bad as most people, but two years is still long enough to form a habit. Smoke breaks at work every day, smoking every time I start my car up, driving around listening to music and smoking, smoking every time I hung out with friends, etc. 

Tomorrow will have been two weeks since I was abruptly put into the hospital for a still unidentified viral infection. My whole body was in so much pain, and I didn't bring my cigarettes to the hospital, so for the nine days I was in there, I refrained from smoking. When I got out, I figured that since I'd gone nine days, I might as well just quit altogether. 

It's been relatively easy but god damn are those cravings deadly when they come. I've been battling them hardcore today. I feel lost without a cigarette in my hand. I'm about to go hang out with a friend of mine, and he's told me that he'll cut back on his smoking while I'm there. I'm still just so afraid that I'll cave. I've got some gum ready, and I've got some weed (which for some reason helps me not smoke cigarettes). 

Help me be strong. It's so hard.

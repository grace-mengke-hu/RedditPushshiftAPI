Quit smoking tonight.

My planned quit date was actually October 5th, but I realized I was just using that extra time to procrastinate. I didn't even cut down at all. So two hours ago I decided to quit cold turkey. My partner is going to quit with me. 

My initial main motivation to quit is that I have leukoplakia, little white spots in my mouth, which my dentist told me can in some cases become precancerous. If I stop smoking I can reduce that risk significantly. I've battled mental illness for years and have just started to make big strides in recovery and seeing how life can really be, and I don't want to survive that just to die from smoking. I had some reservations still, but I watched the video you guys post a lot here and that helped a bit. It helped me to further realize that theres really nothing good or helpful cigarettes are doing for me. 

Wish me luck. I will keep you all updated as I go.

Day 3 - feeling all kinds of weird ?

Hi everyone.
I quit this past Saturday (smoked for 15yrs) after getting smashed on Friday, which made not smoking on the first day quite easy because... hangover. I did buy me a pack of nicorette gums and they do help to keep the cravings at bay, as well as stop me from getting triggered by minor bs. 
However, contrary to what I expected, day 1 and 2 went better then today as far as withdrawal goes. I feel quite weak overall, bit rough & lightheaded and can't keep my focus .. my brain's like a squirrel with ADHD, all over the place, even my memory feels not quite normal... and my mood is just constant 'meh', no interest in anything, just automatically moving through the day.
Anyone else remembers feeling like this ? And can anyone comment on what's to come over the next few days ?

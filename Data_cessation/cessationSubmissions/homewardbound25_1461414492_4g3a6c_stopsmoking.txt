I did it! I drank without smoking.

Had 4-5 beers at the house last night. No smoking! It was hard at times but I am proud to have challenged myself and pushed through. I enjoy drinking and do not plan to stop, so it's good to know I can handle it. Parties with people will be harder, but this is a start.

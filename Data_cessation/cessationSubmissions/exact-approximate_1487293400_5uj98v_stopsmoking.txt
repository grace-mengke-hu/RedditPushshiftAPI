Days Passing Quicker

At day 48 I promised myself I'd check in with the subreddit for my 50th day. It's now 53. That's how quick time is passing. My days no longer feel excruciatingly boring without smoking. Of course I still think about it (particularly when I am angry/sad) - but I constantly remind myself that smoking is not the way to cope with things.

Updates in point form:

* Still occasionally coughing up some yellow stuff. But always feeling better and better every day.

* Getting up in the morning has gotten easier.

* Physical exercise is no longer intimidating.

* Paid for a 3 day trip from the money saved smoking.

* I still sometimes romanticize about smoking.

* I have saved a real lot of time. I haven taken up bathroom stall meditation at work to replace my smoke breaks. It's wonderful.

Has anyone tried using theanine to quit?

So I came across the amino acid theanine purely by accident and I am wondering if anyone has tried using it to curb nicotine cravings.  It is one of the key ingredients in the [Neuro Bliss](http://www.drinkneuro.com/product/bliss/) soda.  I tried the soda at the recommendation of a friend.  If I drink it after work, the stress of the workday just disappears.  If I drink it before bed, I sleep more soundly than usual.

I found a research article that concludes that theanine should be looked into as a treatment for tobacco addiction.  Here's a link to the paper:

[L-theanine inhibits nicotine-induced dependence via regulation of the nicotine acetylcholine receptor-dopamine reward pathway](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11427-012-4401-0)

What do you guys think?  Is theanine worth trying?  Have any of you tried theanine?  If so, how much theanine did you take and when did you take it?  Did it help?  How does the effects of theanine compare to other addiction treatments, like tyrosine for example?  Does theanine work better than tyrosine?

It's been two weeks since I had a cigarette, and I feel terrible....

Terrible as in, I'm sick as a dog from a sinus infection while coughing all the smoke junk and nonsense out of my lungs. I'm sure the quitting didn't help me from becoming sick, but since I've quit its kept me out of the cold and I'm recovering faster than I did when I still smoked. 

Down from a pack of camel menthols a day to nothing, 1/16/14 till forever! <3

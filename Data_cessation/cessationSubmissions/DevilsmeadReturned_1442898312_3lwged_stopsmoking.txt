A question for runners who smoked on stopped (anyone else can chime in too)

So I started on the patch a few days ago, and its been good. (Im a little confused on what to do with my new found time and what todo in social situations with out a smoke.) Im 22 and I've been smoking since I was 14. I always was a good runner, but I have training I todo that I would not be able todo while smoking. But now that I stopped I get out of breath with in the first mile and can't run my usual 3 to 4. What do I have to look forward too? I know my lungs will get better, but what noticeable affect have you seen after you stopped? 

Other question, do your hands circulation become better and if you had shaky hands before smoking, did it stop after you quit? Also erections, I hear they are better when you quit, is that true? What benefits have people noticed, I don't really know what to expect. 8 years is along time, Im having a hard time remembering what is normal.

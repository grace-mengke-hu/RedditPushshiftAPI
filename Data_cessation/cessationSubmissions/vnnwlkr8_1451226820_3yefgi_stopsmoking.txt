Passed the three month mark!

At this moment, I haven't smoked for exactly 3 months :). The first weeks were much easier than expected, having had the motivation boost of reading Allen Carr's book for the first time.

In the second and third month, things didn't change all that much. There have been a few instances in which I became nostalgic about smoking, but I never thought about seriously picking up cigarettes again. The only thing I would smoke is a quality cigar or maybe some pipe tobacco, but I'm not sure that's a smart thing to do, not wanting to go back to cigarettes anymore.

Anyway, I'm looking forward to a smokefree 2016. And the same to you all!

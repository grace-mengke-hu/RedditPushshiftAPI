10 Days in but never have been so motivated! This quit attempt is different from the others, I can feel it. Your right, It feels so good not to be consumed &amp; to have xtra time. I'm still not use to it yet! I downloaded a Smoke Free app on my Iphone, It's super helpful too. It told me 2 come here :)

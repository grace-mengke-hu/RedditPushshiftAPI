Nearly 10days and ten thousand tears.

So after having terrible chest pains, I quit cold turkey! I have been smoking 1- 2 packets a day for seven years. Also, the chest pains are gone! 

The first few days were a breeze. I got minor cravings, the occasional irritability, but nothing I couldn't handle. 

Its now day 9 and I just finished sobbing! Mu boyfriend ran to the corner shop for chocolate aafter o told him im gona break...im gona smoke and it helped somewhat. I didn't smoke. 

Quiting is fucking horrible, terrible business, but I know its well worth it. 

Will there be many more days like this? When does it get just a bit better?

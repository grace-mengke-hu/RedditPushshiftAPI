It's been 11 days...

And I'm still all cloudy in the brain.  What gives???

I just catch myself spacing out for pretty significant periods like a dumbass.  I have no drive and no focus.

I stepped off the patch 11(ish) days ago, stopped actually smoking in May.

Can anyone empathize?  Is there an end to this?

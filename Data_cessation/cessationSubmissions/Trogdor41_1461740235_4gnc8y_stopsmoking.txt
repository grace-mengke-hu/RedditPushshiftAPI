Today is the day

I'm not a smoker, but have used chewing tobacco for about 9 years. I wasn't using regularly up until about 4 years ago. It's taken a while for me to admit that I am, in fact, addicted. I am glad I found this forum. The positivity here is amazing. As a birthday present to myself, today is the day that I quit using. I have half a tin in my back pocket. It is going to stay there. I know I have the willpower.

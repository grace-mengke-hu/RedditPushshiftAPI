day 16 - starting to produce lot of catarrh

Hi guys, two weeks behind, tobacco free! I tought that I would been starting produce mucus and catarrh starting from day 1 but it did not for 2 weeks. Now I am starting to produce a LOT of mucus, catarrh, and a sort of constipated-lungs feeling... can you relate on this?

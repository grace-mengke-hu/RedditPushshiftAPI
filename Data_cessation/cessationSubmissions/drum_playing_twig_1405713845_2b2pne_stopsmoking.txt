I'm thinking about starting again...

So I've been clean 50 days. I quit for financial reasons but money isn't a problem anymore.

And now I'm off work for 3 weeks. Vacation. Everyone I know are either working or are somewhere on vacation. I'm 29 and single. Nothing to do but to sit in the house and be bored outta my mind day in and day out. I feel so lonely.

I've been trying to stay away from alcohol ever since I stopped smoking but I'm seriously considering going out and buy a shitload of beer and a couple of packs of smoke to at least be able to sit on my balcony (which has an insane view) once again and at least enjoy my vacation a little bit, or at least drink and smoke my way through it.

Fuck this sucks. 

P.S. I know all the facts about smoking, and all the Allen Carr stuff. I don't need a lecture. I'm in the "I don't give a fuck" zone soon. Just wanted to vent/whine, really..

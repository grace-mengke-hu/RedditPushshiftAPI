Quitting smoking and weight loss - it is possible.

I decided to quit smoking after about 4 months of focused dieting. I had already lost about 30lbs and was really worried about gaining weight after quitting smoking. But since I quit 46 days ago, I've managed to continue my weight loss, loosing almost another 10lbs!

Quitting smoking did affect my metabolism and hunger. I haven't lost weight quite as quickly and I was stuck at a plateau for about two weeks. Food and cigarette cravings are often linked for me - when I'm hungry I also want to smoke - which means I need extra willpower! But I finally broke through the plateau a week ago,  I've been seeing some really good results lately, and I haven't smoked a single puff in 46 days. 

I hope this motivates anyone who's afraid or unwilling to quit because they want to lose weight, continue loosing weight, or avoid weight gain. I was a fat smoker for years, and now I'm a regular sized non-smoker. :) Smoking =/= Skinny.

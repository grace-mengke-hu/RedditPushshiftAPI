Day 3.

So, this is day 3.  I'm severely struggling.  I held off on posting because honestly - I wasn't sure if I'd make it.  I've posted and failed three times in the past ~four years.

I've smoked about a pack a day for five years.

I'm severely agitated and I'm having a hard time controlling my temper.  I'm having serious ups and downs that seem to be amplified by my panic disorder.  This wasn't a planned quit, I just...did it.

I'm excited about quitting.  It hasn't been very long, but goddamnit does it feel like I can actually breathe.  That's what's keeping me going.  My motivation is having the freedom in my morning routine that isn't dictated by my need to smoke.  Making an effort to improve my lifestyle.  

I felt imprisoned by smoking.  I grew to hate it, but I couldn't quit.  I was too weak.  Too lazy?   Whatever, it doesn't matter now.  Three days.  I get paid tomorrow, I'm scared for that.  I'm afraid the temptation will be there.

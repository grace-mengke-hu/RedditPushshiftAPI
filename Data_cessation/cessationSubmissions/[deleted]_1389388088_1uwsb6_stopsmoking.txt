I'm on the fence. Need some support.

So here's where I'm at. After 6 years of smoking, I quit on november 1st 2011. I quit using Champix. I didn't last the whole 3 months as it made me really nauseous, but it still worked. After that I did not touch a single cigarette until June 2013. I was drunk at a party and I slipped. In August I moved in with 2 smokers. Now every time alcohol is involved at our house I'll smoke. I must have smoked around 50 cigarettes from August until now. I'm still able to control myself when sober, but I'm starting to crave a cigarette when I'm just bored. I really enjoy smoking. I'll always will. But damn do I feel guilty about it. My smoker's cough is starting to return. It's disgusting. I hate myself, I feel like such an idiot for smoking again... Now I feel like all the progress I had done is gone.

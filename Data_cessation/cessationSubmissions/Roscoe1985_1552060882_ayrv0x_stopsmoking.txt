2 mins in... again

I quit smoking for a few months a couple of years ago and picked up the habit again. For my New Years resolution I quit, and was doing a good job until I found a cigarette this morning and started smoking. It tasted gross. I put it out. Just wanted to make a handle on here and join the community of non smokers again. I know it’s possible and I’m going to stay with it!

Snuff, now I’m completely set back.

Let this be a lesson. Never trust anyone, even your own siblings when it comes to things you know nothing about. I wasn’t aware of what snuff was, it’s dry tobacco for those wondering. My brother convinced me to use it saying it was just mint to help clear the nostrils. He later tells me it’s tobacco. So here I am, completely set back with a huge headache. Never trust anyone guys, especially if it’s something you aren’t sure about.

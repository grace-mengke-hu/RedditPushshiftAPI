60,000 cigarettes

I've been a smoker for approximately 8 years, 66 days and 7 hours. I average about a pack a day, putting my consumption in the ballpark of 60k. Using an average price estimate, that places my monetary expenditure around 24,000 dollars. I've tried to quit a few times, but it never really stuck. I honestly didn't want to quit. I still don't. Spring is coming and I can barely walk my dog without running out of breath. My teeth are shot. Maybe posting here, voicing it in a place where I'm actually accountable for what I say, will help push me in the right direction. I'd grateful for any advice or tips. Vapeing is not an option by the way. I've found its accessibility actually exacerbates my habits. That, and I keep putting them through the washing machine.... Anyway, wish me luck everybody.

3 months smoke free!

Today I've been smoke free for 3 months. I have an easier time breading, my skin is not grey anymore and my hands and feet are not always cold as they were before. But the best thing is to be free of the stress of always making time for a cigarett!
My anxiety levels have become much lower and it feels really good actually caring for my health. I used two aids to help me stay with my quit. An App called Smoke Free and Allen Carrs book Finally a non smoker. I highly recommend them both. After a week or two I started to cave in and these aids helped keeping me on track when I was struggling. I hope all you of you are doing well in your quit and that my post may help someone who is struggling. Best of luck to you all!

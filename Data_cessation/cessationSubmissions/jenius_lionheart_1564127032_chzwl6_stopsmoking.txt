Reflections from Europe - I made it one week

I hope to keep going when I return home tomorrow. I can honestly say the cravings have subsided considerably. I didn't put myself in situations where I knew I wasn't during enough yet (pubs, hanging out with smoking people). When a craving came, I tried to remember that it wasn't over - I hadn't caved yet, I had not bought the pack. So that horrible feeling didn't get me. I posted here often and tried to really be mindful, remember my kids, and more than anything, I breathed. Deep and long. Often. Thanks to you all.

I want to quit. I need to quit. I know I must quit. I can't quit. Suggestions to kick it?

"This, is my last pack," said one-hundred thousand times, and once more. 
That skinny, little white pimp has had me in his clutches for 6 years. Whoring out my health at $7 a pack. I speak to my pimp: when I get in the car, when I get a break, when I need a rest, after a meal, and before a test. I found that any time can be the right time to take the hand of my skinny white pimp and go for a stroll down the avenue--don't run though *COUGH*COUGH* Spat! There goes a piece of my lung, charred black and...ew. 

So, I ask of you, how do you do what you do when the mind's made up that this relationship is thru?

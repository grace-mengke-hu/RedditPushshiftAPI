Moving back to campus in a week, hope I don't relapse.

I quit when I moved out of my dorm and back into my parents' house for the summer, not for any reasons related to their approval, but because it made me feel like shit and I knew I needed to stop in order to improve my rock climbing skills (which I've been doing a lot this summer). 

The only problem is I quit last summer too, and made it about 3 months then relapsed on campus because smoking circles are just so relaxing. I miss being able to walk outside at 1am with my friends and light up an American Spirit, then go back in after 15 minutes of relaxing. 

I told myself I'd never smoke again though, and I've been shitfaced drunk near cigarettes and resisted before, so I should be alright. Wish me luck.

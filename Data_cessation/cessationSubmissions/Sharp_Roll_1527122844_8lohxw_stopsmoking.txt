How do you go about quitting smoking either cigs or weed if you only smoke out of boredom?

I have been smoking both cigs and weed now daily for all of my twenties and now that I am nearing my 30s I know I need to quit, but I am a loner in real life and stay in the house all day long because I have depression and high anxiety when I leave the house and I am not a very social person and I don't have much social skills......So to deal with my boredom I smoke cigs and weed every 30 minutes during the whole day and I'm scared to quit because I will def. not know what to do with myself then, because I don't have any hobbies or much interests in anything

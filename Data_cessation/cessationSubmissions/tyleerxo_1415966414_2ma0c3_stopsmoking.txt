Nearly 3 weeks.. But first night out tonight... Very worried!!

So i've gone nearly 3 weeks without a cigarette (20 days!) and feeling good but tonight is my first night out drinking and I don't know how I'm going to do it as i've always smoked on nights out and most of my friends do it. I haven't got a great amount of will power when i'm drunk either and i always just give in. 

Any advice would really be appreciated!!

Lung capacity restoration

Hi everyone. First of all I'd like to thank you all for giving me the motivation to quit smoking. It's been a tough couple of days but through all the willpower that emanates from this subreddit I've been able to suppress the urge to smoke for almost a week now.

As an introduction, I've been smoking for over 6 months before this. Once I smoked an entire pack when I was drunk, but on average I would say I've smoked about 3-5 cigarettes a day. Before I used to smoke, I used to run 10 miles every single day, and was quite a powerful runner. While I was smoking, I ceased to continue running because it simply hurt too much to run, and I would be out of breath by the 3 mile mark. Now, I cant even run a mile without feeling really sick inside and wanting to throw up.

How long does it take to get back my lung capacity? I understand that because of my smoking I may never reach my full lung capacity again, but can my lungs ever improve a significant amount? Will I be able to run again?

Thank you.

Horrible tickle in my throat that leads to severe coughing

About a month ago, I went from smoking about a pack and a half for 40 years, to 4-5 cigarettes a day. I am super proud of this accomplishment.

But after a month, I am still having this tickle in my throat that leads to severe coughing spasms. I cough for what seems like an eternity. To the point to where I can barely breath. This occurs especially in the middle of the night, waking me up from a sound sleep. I try drinking water or some cheap lozenge. But it isn't working and is really taking its toll on me. 

I figure it is 40 years worth of crap just expelling itself and will eventually go away. But it is driving me nuts right now. What can I do to get through this most uncomfortable period?

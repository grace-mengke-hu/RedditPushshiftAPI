Using a ecig for cravings behind my wifes back

Why i ask myself,its not like i have started smoking again after 3 months of quitting. Stopped smoking 11th July using champix best thing i've used to get this far.Tried twice before using the ecig went 5 weeks then 19 days and caved in.
My wife as no idea what its like to quit as she has never smoked but has been brought up with smokers in her family.
She knew i was a smoker when we met 24 years ago/smoking for 30 years but only smoked maybe 10/15 a day.
Usual when getting up/after meals/beer/last one at night.
I feel alot better dont get me wrong food tastes better/smell is back/putting on the pounds never done that in my life as im eating for england.
I've had no well done from her at all just your getting a right fat you no the rest. 
Feel like just saying if you dont like it then im starting smoking again,what harm is a ecig doing with no nicotine in it.
Confused

Can’t stand to be near my SO

Hello. I am new to this sub reddit. I am 2 days smoke free using Wellbutrin. I quit using it two years and did alright but only lasted a week, I thought it was time to try again. 

I come from a family of smokers. Growing up everybody smoked. Parents, sisters brothers, aunts, uncles. No wonder I started when I was 15! I am now 33 and I am the only one who has yet to quit. I am proud of my family member and I want to quit too. I am currently laid off right now and on unemployment. I thought what better time to go through withdrawal than when I am home alone and not dealing with stress from work? 

My SO refuses to even try to quit. We’ve been through this before. Sometimes where it’s even his idea “oh yeah we should both quit smoking we can do it together!” But when it comes time to actually do it, he won’t even try. 

I’m getting no support from him what so ever. He’s still smoking in the house. He won’t even entertain the idea of going outside to smoke. I’ve scrubbed our bedroom top to bottom to get the cigarette smell out the best I could and that’s my only escape when he’s home. He even got angry about the fact that I told him he was not allowed to smoke in the bedroom,  but I kind of lost my head a little and he got over it. 

The first day I quit we had errands to run and were in the car and he kept lighting up and “forgetting” to roll the window down” he was hot boxing me in the car! 

He comes to bed at night and I can smell the cigarettes on him. It’s driving me insane. I cannot stand to be around him because he makes my cravings out of control. It’s getting to the point where as soon as he comes home, I go in the bedroom and shut the door and don’t come out until I absolutely have to. I don’t know what else to do. I don’t want to smoke anymore.

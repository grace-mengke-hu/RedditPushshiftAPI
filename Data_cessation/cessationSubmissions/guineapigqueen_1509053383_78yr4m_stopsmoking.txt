want to quit smoking, but don't want it enough

background: almost 21 yrs old, started smoking when I was about 19.5 years old. I never considered myself a chronic smoker or an addict. Took me half a year to get through my first two packs of Marlboros and I have only smoked three cigarettes since June of this year.  
Because of my bf wanting me to quit and also me reading about the consequences of smoking, I decided to stop buying cigs and quit. But the problem is that I don't really want to throw
away the cigs I have left over. I told my bf that I don't want to waste the money I've spent (it's stupid, I know) and he told me he'll even pay back the money I've spent on cigs if I trash them. However, I realize it's not about the money because I still really don't want to throw it away. It's cliche but I feel that I can quit anytime and that using up the rest of my cigs can't hurt me. One part of me want to trash everything tobacco and stop right now, yet another part of me just...don't want to?  

I don't understand why I am so on the fence about quitting because the obvious answer is to quit. I know that if I keep this up, I'll become more dependent on smoking. I used to smoke because 1.) people around me were or 2.) trying to suppress appetite (unsuccessfully). But the last couple of times, it was to calm my nerves because I was upset. I do feel concerned that I started to feel positive effects from smoking.  
I just can't figure out why I don't have strong negative feelings about something that will harm me (and people around me) so much. If a friend was to offer me a cig right now, I can see myself accepting it without an issue because it feels like a nonissue.  

Anyways, I hope I wasn't too ramble-y. I guess I've been thinking about this problem for a couple of months now and just want to let it out.

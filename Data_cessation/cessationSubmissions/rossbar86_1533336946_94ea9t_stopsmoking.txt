Have you been unable to quit using Allen Carr's method? Or anything you would improve?

Hello, I am curious to know if there are any current smokers out there who have tried Allen Carr's method, either the book or in-person seminars, and not been able to quit? If so, I would be curious to know why you think that may be. Thanks!

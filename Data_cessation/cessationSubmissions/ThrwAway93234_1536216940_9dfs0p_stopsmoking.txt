1 Month +

Well, 34 days! I'm proud of this achievement, and truly believe that I will never smoke a cigarette again. I've never gone this long without nicotine, and it truly feels like I've had a shift in perspective (largely thanks to Alan Carr's 'Easy Way').  I'm also 4 months (120 days) without cannabis. If you had told me this time last year that I would no longer be smoking ANYTHING, I would not have believed it. 

All this being said, I've been feeling on the weaker side the last couple of days, and very anxious. I guess the honeymoon period is over, and I'm coming to terms with the fact that there are many problems in life, and that I have been using nicotine and cannabis as coping mechanisms for many years. Still, I will continue to improve my life and tackle these problems head on. This is one of the more subtle benefits of quitting smoking that I have found - life becomes more real, you are learning to deal with emotions in the natural way, you are no longer escaping from your troubles.

Thanks to the community and I wish you all the best. I'm not so active here but there have been a couple times like this where I have felt weak and anxious, and I have just wanted to get things off of my chest, and this sub has been nothing short of supportive.  

Congrats to everyone who is embarking on this journey, I wish you all the strength.

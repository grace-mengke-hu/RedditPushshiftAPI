Crazy 3 weeks and never thought I would make it

Pretty proud of myself I didnt even want to quit at the time just wanted to prove to myself that I could do it. 3 weeks in and after that first 5 days it is so much better. I still get some cravings but just ignore them and they pass. I even am drinking on weekends and my roomy smokes and I dont even miss it really. He stinks and I dont boom! ;)

Tongue Numb/Weird

It's been about 4 months, and my tongue has been feeling weird on and off, like something is coating it, or its sort of numb. Since a lot of crazy stuff happens to you when you quit, I thought I'd ask here and see if any of you fine people know of this happening and why. It could also be unrelated. Thanks!

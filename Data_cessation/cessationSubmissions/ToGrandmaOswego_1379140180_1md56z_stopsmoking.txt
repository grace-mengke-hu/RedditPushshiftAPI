Talking to smokers

First off, you guys are amazing. I've been lurking here for days and days - just reading your stories/comments. Thank you!

I'm on day 11 and I already consider myself a nonsmoker (though the thought of never ever smoking again does make me sad for a space of a second or two sometimes).  I've been cautious about being around my smoker sister.  I know she is waiting for me to start back up so we can head back outside to do our business.  But I had to go over to her house 2 nights ago and I was really apprehensive.  I knew where her cigs were and I knew where she kept the lighter, the ashtray...  

I forgot to observe her before and after she went out for her smoke. I didn't even think about it. Then the smell hit me.  Good god, its awful.  She knows me pretty well and I know I must have made a face because she said "I can quit easily, I've done it with every one of my pregnancies, it's just that I don't want to because I enjoy it so much. I loove smoking."  

That's the hardest idea for me to give up too - that I too loved smoking.  I smoked 5-7 cigarettes a day for the past 20 years. I tried to respond but she got really defensive and I'm not really in a place right now to fight the good fight for someone else.  I left it alone.  The point is yay - I was at her house and I didn't fall into the trap.

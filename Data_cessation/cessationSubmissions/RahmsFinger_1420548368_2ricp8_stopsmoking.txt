How do I tell my family I'm now a non-smoker?

They know I'm a secret smoker, thanks to my little sister bringing it up one day at dinner. But it's never really acknowledged directly, only brought up in obscure passive aggressive ways.

They could be talking about BBQ, and when they they say the word "smoke" it's vocally in all caps, and they look at me. Or, a relative who is 95 and has smoked for 60 years gets a cold, they're all, "well she hasn't had the CANCER yet, RARE for SMOKING for SIXTY years."

They aren't subtle, and while it's funny, I'd rather just let them know (in the easiest way possible) that their 60 year old normcore hipster comedy stand up routine has run out of material.

So how do I tell them I'm a non-smoker?!!!

29- now is as good a time as any. Snus is very expensive, and I cringe when thinking about the money which could have been spent otherwise.

It's time to quit now, after constantly replenishing myself with nicotine. This post will be updated when the lack of nicotine plays havoc on the mind and those apocalyptic feelings and the brain-fog and highly exaggerated aggression start showing up.

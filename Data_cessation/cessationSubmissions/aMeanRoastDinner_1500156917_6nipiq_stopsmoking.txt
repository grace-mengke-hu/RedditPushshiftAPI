Broke my streak twice but don't feel bad

As you can see by my badge it's been 66 days since I 'stopped smoking.' Since then I have smoked 2 cigarettes when out with friends, I don't feel like this makes me a smoker or disrupted my mindset of quitting. I know for a fact I am not going to go to the shops tomorrow and buy some, or actively look for someone to pinch one off. Trying to work out if I should be concerned that I have smoked.

Almost finishing the hardest part: day 1, but...

I decided to smoke my last cigarette yesterday in the afternoon. During the night I managed well because ate well, played Dota and went to bed, never left the house. However, since 11 am my anxiety is beyond imagine. I bought some gum and drink iced water, but there is no way I stop thinking about smoking another one. HELP!

[opinion] reset your badge asap

Here's some advice after a relapse: reset your badge. This advice doesn't work for everyone, it's just my opinion. But I was close to 100 days and relapsed hard. I avoided the group because we smokers tend to feel shame a lot and I felt like resetting my badge was too humiliating. I finally sucked up the courage and reset my badge. With it out there for the world, I went through this acceptance process and quit again in a day or two. 

Take it or leave it, it might help someone else. But resetting my badge did the trick for me.

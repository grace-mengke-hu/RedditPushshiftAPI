Officially 100 hours down without one puff!

I was sitting at my work smoking area and kept hearing over and over in my head, "There's no good time to quit, there's no good time to quit...". It was my last cigarette in that pack and I looked at my pack and decided right there. I've smoked for 10 years a pack to 2 packs a day... I was fed up and ashamed of my weak will. I said "F**** it, I'm going for it". I got the smoke free app and hit start. I told only my closest SO's but not everyone, just enough that I'd be ashamed if I failed. That was my driving fuel to fight the urges. I thought of failing them and failing myself. I'm a disabled veteran and have way too many health issues to make it worse by smoking those nasty sticks. Thank you to the supporters of this sub and the kind words and advice. I will be sticking around for a long time to pay it forward. Cheers!

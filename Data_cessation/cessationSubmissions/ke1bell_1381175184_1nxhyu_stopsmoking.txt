Day 4-I'm so fast!

Yesterday, I ran an Oktoberfest 5k (3rd year in a row) and I actually got a personal record!  I've never been a 'fast' runner and I didn't expect to feel the difference so quickly, but I cut over 15 seconds off my PR mile pace (almost a minute off my mile pace from the last race I ran)!!  I was coughing up so much crap during the run, doing snot rockets left and right....but ya know what?  I could breath deeper.  I usually have to stop around mile 2ish of a 3-4 mile run to catch my breath, but not this time.  My legs seem to be happy to show me what they got since my lungs are no longer holding them back!


Boyfriend couldn't be happier-he says he LOVES to finally get to smell 'me'....not cigarettes!  There is something so freeing about being able to get drunk and NOT having a cig.  It's not so much that i'm just craving and want want want want one.  It's more like 'that's not an option anymore.  I'm not a smoking runner.  I'm a runner that's gonna be getting faster and faster NOT wasting her time/money/energy smoking.'


Onwards!  Upwards!

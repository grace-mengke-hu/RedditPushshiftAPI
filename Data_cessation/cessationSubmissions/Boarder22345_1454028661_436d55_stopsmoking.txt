E-pen helped me quit...but not in the way I expected.

I bought a vape pen to lay off cigarettes. I think this subreddit mentioned how successful it can be for some people. Well anyways...

Smoked it for 3 days and it dried me out. Dry throat, headaches, very cold flu symptoms. I couldn't even look at the thing anymore. I didn't want a cigarette. I just wanted the pain to go away. 

It made me realize how much smoking a cigarette sends a false sense of security. I mean, I would wake up with headaches on occasion after binge smoking, but nothing like this. And getting sick on top of it made me realize how much I've been compromising my immune system.

I decided to quit that day. It was rough and my wife definitely was feed up with a sick dude in withdrawals. I just felt so aggravated and bothered. Everything was in a fog. It was all my addiction talking to me. I was not fun to be around but I made quitting my priority.

Day 6 now and have some cravings but nothing I can't control, how sick I felt is still fresh in my mind and I'm using that as motivation. Now I'm just hacking up all the mucus and tar that's been built up in my throat and lungs. It's not pleasant but it is satisfying in a purging kind of way.

The real test starts today. I'm thinking clearer and have energy to let my mind wonder. About to go to the gym (just got a membership) to occupy my mind. 

Thanks for listening, needed to put this out there.

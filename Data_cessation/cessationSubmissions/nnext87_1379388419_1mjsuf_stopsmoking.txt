Quitting now, thanks to you.

Quitting has been at the back of my mind for a while now. I know I want to, but just haven't felt like I could go without cigarettes. . I guess it's just a self discipline thing.

I had no intention of quitting today. I hadn't even thought about it really. I don't use reddit much, but came on here just to check out some Game of Thrones stuff.. I got sidetracked and ended up here. Reading through some of your posts, has really given me the confidence to do it. The more I read, the more I feel like I'm done with smoking. I'm getting rid of all my cigarettes, lighters and ashtrays.. and I'm giving it the boot. Thank you. You've definitely inspired me.

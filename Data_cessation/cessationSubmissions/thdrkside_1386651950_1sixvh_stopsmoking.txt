Shedding Layers

It's been 66 days and I don't think about cigarettes much anymore unless I see someone smoking or something like that. 

But it's weird, I've been feeling a little bit antsy the past couple days and I never even considered that cigarettes could be the cause; it's been a long time since I had a recognizable craving. I took a nap today and in my dream it was sort of hard to breathe. When I woke up, I got this giant whiff of cigarettes. Once I was fully awake the smell was nowhere to be found. 

I mean 66 days and I'm still shedding deep layers. But this means I'm looking forward to being even more healed than I am now. I'm like a fucking caterpillar

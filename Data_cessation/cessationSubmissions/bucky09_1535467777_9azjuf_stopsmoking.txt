Smoking to Vaping Question

I figured i would ask here. I have been a pack a day (at least) smoker for about 10 years. I'm happy to say that i am now 10 days off of smoking (seriously not a single cig) and only using the Aspire Breeze 2 vaporizer with 3mg of nicotine.

I have one major issue: Anxiety attacks. Im trying to figure out if this is a withdrawal symptom of quitting smoking or taking in too much nicotine from the vaporizer. I am using the vaporizer in the same times i use to smoke or less.

Anyone here in the same situation?

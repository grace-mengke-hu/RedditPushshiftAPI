Pack, Patches, or Turkey? What do you think?

Around a 3/5 of a pack a day smoker. Partying? 1-1.5 packs. 

I told myself (and a bunch of guys in my fraternity) I would quit yesterday entirely. I slapped a patch on my shoulder and went about my day. No problem. Today, I didn't put any patch on. Big mistake. I crumbled and bought a pack of cigarettes, figuring that weaning off could be a better option.
That way, I don't have to rely on heavy-dosage patches (they are 21mg over 24 hrs compared to roughly .7mg per stick). The patches are leftover from my last (shortlived) attempt at quitting, and I only have 5 left. 

I don't know if I "have the will" to give it up cold turkey, so the fact that I've bought more cigarettes is definitely a temptation. With the stress of college, it's pretty easy to succumb to easy relief.

I've set a goal to be done by next Tuesday. I'm thinking that stretching my pack to the 30th could be a good idea, if I can make it. I've got 19 left.  I don't want to throw my cigarettes out, but I don't want to enable an unhealthy habit anymore either.

Does anyone have any ideas as to what the best course of action might be? Is there a good length of time for weaning off? Is it all in my head? Talk some sense into me, please.

Also: I've had three of them since I woke up at 7am today (it's now 3:15 EST).

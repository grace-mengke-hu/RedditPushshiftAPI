I emotionally manipulated someone into quitting smoking and i'm starting to question if it was the right thing to do.

 Basically that person has lung disease and smoking is affecting their health in a negative way, coughing fits every day, shortness of breath after a flight of stairs, etc.. Watching them not willing to stop has taken a toll on my mental health so i got pissed and decided to try to do something and ended up manipulating them into promising to quit.
 Is it the right thing to do, i'm starting to doubt myself but i'm afraid its the only way because they lack the willpower to stop.

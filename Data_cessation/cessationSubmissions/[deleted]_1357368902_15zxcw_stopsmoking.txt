Replacing smoking habits

Hey guys, on day two, and I'm beginning to realize that, over the time that I've smoked, I've developed some strong habits that go along with my smoking. These habits keep triggering my impulses to smoke. For example, after working for 30-60 mins I usually take a break, go outside, and smoke. It used to be a huge stress reliever and a big reset button. Also, I used to smoke and drink coffee during walks every evening to a nearby park. I've been scared to take my walk or drink coffee or even go outside during my work breaks because I don't want to be tempted over the edge of another cig. How have you guys changed your habits? I full intend to quit but do I just have to persist, or are there some methods you guys have used to steer you away from smoking? I'm talking about a form of substitution or something for habits that trigger smoking. Thanks and happy quitting!

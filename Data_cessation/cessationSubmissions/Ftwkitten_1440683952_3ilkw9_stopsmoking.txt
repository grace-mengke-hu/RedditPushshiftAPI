Trying to stop but need some help

I have been trying to stop smoking for 2 weeks now. The problem I am having is my husband smokes and isn't ready to quit. I am fine in the mornings and at work but in the evenings when I'm around him I brake. Does anyone have any ideas on how I can be around him and not smoke. He goes outside to smoke but knowing that's what he is doing gets to me. Please help me figure this out.

3 months trying back to 7 days free

I've smoked 8 times in the past three months, going 5, 10, 15 days and now I'm back to 7 days smoke free and posting to go one more day and then another.  I've definitely stumbled but haven't fallen.  Each time I've smoked a couple a cigarettes then come to my senses and throw the rest of the pack away. I'm just aiming to that now BEFORE I actually smoke.  I'm visiting this subreddit more now and think posting will help.

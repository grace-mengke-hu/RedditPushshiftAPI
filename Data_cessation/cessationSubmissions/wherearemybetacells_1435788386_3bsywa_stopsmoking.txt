One week!

Well, nearly :p at midnight (it's 10:53pm in Ireland) it'll be a week since I've inhaled nicotine into my body. I'm honestly so happy. Yes, it's the early stages but I was smoking and vaping for 7 years. I was a half-a-pack a day smoker and if I was drinking I'd buy another pack because I chain smoked while drinking. When I started vaping I was obsessed and actually preferred it so much to smoking. I vaped for 2 years continuously. And I mean continuously haha I'm not sure how my usage compared to others because I don't have any vaping friends but I would vape a 3ml tank of 12mg liquid in about 12 hours. I just loved vaping so much and I didn't know how I'd stop because I wasn't even in any distress from my vaping. I always said I'd give up but I didn't think I would, or if I did give up it wouldn't be for many many years for reasons unbeknownst to be right now.

The first 2-3 days I was intensely hungry and just felt down and sleepy like I wanted to crawl into bed. Days 4 and 5 I had intense anger and also a sense of numbness, I'm normally very chirpy but I felt pretty off. Yesterday and today I'm alright, have some hunger pangs but I don't have many cravings and my mood is alright I think! I know this is only a week in but I'm so happy and I already feel a lot better than I did.

This time 7 days ago I was reading Allen Carr's book and although it made sense I still wasn't overly sure I'd be finished for good. But I am :)

Embarking on this journey

I've been smoking for 10 years, finally decided to quit on monday, yesterday I had my last cigarette. It is the first time I made this decision during these 10 years. And it's terrible, I can't stop thinking about smoking.


I thought that it would be a good time to do it because it seemed like nothing stressful would happen at work, but today (OF COURSE) something awful happened and I craved a cig so badly. After coming home I sat all day on the couch, depressed, unable to think about anything else but a cigarette.


Luckily my depression made me too lazy to go and buy a pack, otherwise I would be smoking right now. 
I wonder whether I'll manage to push through. My boyfriend is smoking so that makes it a little harder too, but he tries to be sensitive and smokes as little as possible when at home.


The funniest thing is that while on average I smoked about 10 cigs a day, sometimes I could easily go for 24 hours with no cigarettes or 1 cigarette. I never smoked at work. But now it's just killing me even though it's been only 30 hours since the last one.


Wish me luck guys, I hope that I'll manage to stay on track.

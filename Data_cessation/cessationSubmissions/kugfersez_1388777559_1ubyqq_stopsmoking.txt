1 Month Down, the rest of my life to go...

So I decided to quit cold turkey a month ago after 5 years of smoking 30 a day.  I was tired of drowning in smoke and feeling like an old man at age 23. I didn't run or ride bikes or kayak anymore. I rarely left my house if the alternative destination was a smoke free zone. I chose to live in a cocoon of tobacco and found a lot of bullshit justifications for doing so. 

Now I'm done with all that. The first 3 days were uniquely shitty and surreal but they were worth it. Every day since then has gotten easier. For anyone trying and struggling to quit: you can. It's not a cakewalk and there is no finish line. All the crap your addiction throws at you to keep you puffing, and all the punishment it metes out at you for trying to quit could stop anyone in their tracks. Push through it. Download a quit smoking app, lock yourself away for a few days- whatever it takes. For me, the grass is already greener.

Tl;dr- usual stuff about smoking and how its bad for you. 1 month yay.

Day 5.

It's day 5, almost day 6. I've never gone this long before in a quit attempt if I recall correctly.

I rewarded myself by rejoining a discord group that tbh, I lurk in. They have a bot that asks questions. The bot asked "What are you addicted to?" I wanted to say "Nothing" but that would be a lie. I'm just not currently feeding it.

I feel numb and I haven't taken a shower in 5 days. I'm probably going to feel great after a shower. 

I do take time to breathe air from outside and it is nice. It's nice to reach a goal on some level. I'm not doing the "I'll figure anything out if I can just put this nonsense behind me " thing. I'm just tired, and kind of sad.

On Sunday, I'm going to church and I'll suprise my parents. I'll do some laundry today to have my clothes smell nice. I won't say anything this time but I'll know. It's going to be nice.

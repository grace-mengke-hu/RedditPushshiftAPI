Smoking is such a little bitch.

I quit, after over 20 years at a pack a day, this past Monday at 5 am. Here's what I've learned:

Smoking is a sneaky little fuck. It likes to try and hit you when you least expect it with a craving. Chew gum, read Alan Carr, do anything but give in to a cigarette.

Smoking is a control freak with your time. It really puts you on a schedule, doesn't it? Think about it: A fucking plant mixed with a bunch of chemicals is planning your day for you. And the more you let it, the more liberties it talked with your time. The bossy little fuck even demands you go outside in the cold for a smoke. And you do.

Getting cancer gets expensive. Where I live, cigarettes are about ten bucks a pack. That's three hundred bucks a month. 

You are going to quit. It's inevitable. You can either choose the time and place, or you can with for smoking to choose it for you. Perhaps in a doctor's office seven years from now with the news that a growth has been found in your chest x-ray. Your call.

Smoking wants you all to itself. You're out having a great time with friends, but smoking gets jealous and creeps into your thoughts. Suddenly, you start to get the itch and let your eyes dart to the exit. Not long now, huh? Smoking will give you a ten minute grace period, at the end of which you're so distracted that you're not really paying attention to your friends. Time to grab your coat and duck out. 

Those are a few observations. And a few reasons I'm not going back. Fuck everything about smoking.

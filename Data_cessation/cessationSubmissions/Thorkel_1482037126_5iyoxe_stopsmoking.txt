I smoked tonight . . .

but I'm not resetting my badge. I figure the amount of nicotine I've consumed tonight is pretty small compared to someone who has been on, say, patches or the gum for the past eight days. Also, I think resetting my badge would just serve to demoralize me and make me even less confident in my ability to quit. I'm still quitting. This is just a hiccup. Hopefully it will be my last one. Stay strong, everybody!

Update: Upon further reflection, I have decided to reset my badge. I'm also quitting drinking, and I relapsed on that last night too, so I think for the sake of integrity I should just reset both my r/stopsmoking badge and my r/stopdrinking badge. I'm still committed to having a positive attitude about it, though.

almost day 30 - no longer hate myself

That weird depressed fog I was going through, is finally lifting. I was worried for a little while. Depressed, angry, confused. I would have preferred to continue smoking than be in that funky ass mood. It's getting better and I am feeling a bit more motivated. This California heat and humidity that just hit is making things difficult. but it's getting better. Those cravings, are a passing thought. Now I just want fruit cups and gummi bears. (wtf is up with the sweet cravings?) Still tired though, but my real bad mood swing temperament is getting better. I think my last outburst can be attributed to lady business. 

I recently had my mother stay with me over the weekend and we took a 2 hour trip to see my sister. My mom is still a smoker and with her in my house, in my room, in my car... i had no cravings or issues with the smoke. None. also standing on the driveway with several other family members as they smoked and chatted, I just told myself, I'm not smoking today. Worked just fine.

30 days = 600 cigarettes NOT smoked.

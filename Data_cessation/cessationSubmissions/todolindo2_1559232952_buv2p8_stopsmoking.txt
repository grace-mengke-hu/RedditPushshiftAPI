Weekly breakdowns

For two thursdays in a row Ive let the stress of work relationships life everything get to me and both days Ive bought a pack, smoked one or two cigarettes and then thrown the pack away... I threw them away because my throat hurt even after just one and i was like whats the point of trying to seek relief from.this if theres this like learning curve to smoke again? Why am i doing this to myself. What gives. Lmao this is after over two months of quitting nicotine

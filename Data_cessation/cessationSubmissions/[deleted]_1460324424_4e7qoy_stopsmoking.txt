It really is easy.

Hey guys, i was smoking 5years give or take some monts and i didnt smoke for 6 months as my first serious attempt. 

This time im not smoking for good and 2 months passed... I must say what i realized today, life is really better without smoking. Its not only the smell, money, health problems, but its also selfpity tool, something to repeat a crying process on and on.
Without smoking im somehow new person, im more talkative, i enjoy things more, going to the gym fully again, im not repeatedly sad for no reason through week for day or two. In whole two months i have been down in the mood like for a day. 


 6 months attempt was harder, i counted days i wished i kinda smoked throught it... and now ? I barely think of it, in last month i thought about smoking like 5 times max ? 

Right now i just remembered that i would like to encourage some people that it is really possible to be free for good. I didnt want to try it again, i thought of many possible outcomes which just frightened me, but they were false, none of them happened to be true, so do it too!


I may sound too cocky, but its over. 
Good luck everyone and thanks for reading. :)

A method that has worked for me and many of my friends

If you're a smoker and you want to quit, smoke a cigarette when you really don't want to... 

I haven't smoked in months because of this. For example, I don't like smoking immediately after I wake up (other people may like this so find a time or situation in the day when you don't want a cig). So when I woke up I would immediately roll a cigarette, smoke it and then feel like shit. Or if in any other part of the day you don't want a cigarette, or you do want one, just smoke one, then smoke another. Smoking 2 or 3 cigarettes in a row for me feels terrible. This made me absolutely hate the effect of tobacco whilst still satisfying my need for nicotine. Eventually I got so sick of the effect of tobacco that I quit. I've been tobacco free for 7 months and even thinking about having a cig makes my stomach turn.

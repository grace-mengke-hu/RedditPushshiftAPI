1 Year Today

Well, I made it 1 year. This sub helped alot. Along with a 5 pound bag of jolly ranchers to get me through the first few weeks.  I puffed an ecig a few times when I went out drinking for the first time after quitting, but it didn't really do anything for me. What made the most difference, and made it easier to quit, was the fact that I made the decision that I was done with smoking.  Also I started my quit with a horrible chest cold. 

Anyways, thanks for all the support from here.  I know that I'm done with cigarettes. 20 years of off and on smoking - mostly on - varying from 4 cigs to over a pack per day.  As other quitters have said, it does indeed get easier as time goes by.  Just keep on making that decision to not be a smoker.

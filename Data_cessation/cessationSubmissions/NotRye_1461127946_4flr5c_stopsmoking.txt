I did it! Wooooooo!

It all started on April 20th, 2015, with some Nicoderm patches that my doctor prescribed to me.  Soon after, I found this subreddit and then Allen Carr's awesome book which a lot of you recommended.

And now, 365 days later, I am very pleased to report that I have zero cravings for cigarettes or nicotine in any form.  

I'm free, and I have y'all to thank.

To any new members, I suggest sticking around and participating in this group.  Also, read The Easy Way to Stop Smoking.  It helped me, and it could help you, too.  

Anyway, take care and have a nice day!

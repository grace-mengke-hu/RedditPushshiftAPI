I want to quit for good.

So I've quit a few times, but I want this time to be the last.

The last time I quit, I experienced the best emotional and physical highs, but I can't even remember the point that I fell back into my addiction. Taste and smell come back quickly and make life better, but I want to get past the easy part and really make a change this time.

I want to hear a few success stories to remind me what it is to feel that way. Remind me why I'm doing this and maybe I won't trick myself into smoking another pack.

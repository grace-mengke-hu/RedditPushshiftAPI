I just want a little

About 10 days tobacco free, which is great.. I was on about a pack every week or two before I stopped so it hasnt been awfully difficult, but I do want to cheat...


 Been smoking just weed for about 2 weeks at this point (id been mixing tobo and weed in my bong for about 4 years prior) its honestly been nice smoking just green, I'm saving so much money: literally smoked less than a gram in a week down from a conservative estimate of half an ounce a ounce a month.


 So I'm pretty happy with myself. But I'm going to be in a social setting in a few days and I want to smoke a spliff. I know I shouldnt, and I still might not, but I'm pretty tempted. I don't want to smoke a straight joint (so wasteful), I dont want to smoke a straight cig(yuck.. and thats true defeat), and a bong is just inconvenient for travel.. 


I did tell myself at the start that I'd smoke a cigar after being one month without a cig, no inhaling of course but for taste and a little buz (love me a good arturo fuente). I suppose one spliff, in a rare social setting, instead isnt SO crazy, right? 


Look at me try and rationalize this.. Nicotine addiction is a real slippery bitch, huh?

It's a weird ride but a ride I wish won't stop. D-3

At almost day 4 now, and this is turning out to be a lot harder of a battle for me. Still going strong though.

I didn't consider the fact that I work around people who all literally smoke. I did a head-count and funnily enough, out of my 92 co-workers, I did not find 1 non-smoker in my working circle. To make matters worse, due to my work area, people can smoke freely if they handle their own trash accordingly.

&amp;nbsp;

People started asking,

&gt;**"Why aren't you smoking?**

&amp;nbsp;

I thought I could easily answer this question and move on. I said *"I quit smoking."* and expected people to understand. Instead, I found myself in the middle of a laughing debate. They started betting how long I'd last before I'd smoke. 

I know. Changing my environment and those around me is the solution but they're nice people and they mean well. They're just joking because they've seen my smoking habits. A guy who smoked 3/4ths of a pack per day? Phew, stop kidding he can't quit cold turkey.

&amp;nbsp;

Then they come one by one,

&gt;**"Forgot your cigs? Let me give you one."**

&amp;nbsp;

I thought I could easily decline their generous offer. This turned out to be a lot harder than I expected. I hesitated a lot but in the end, I declined.

I wanted to tell them something. Something that could convince them that I'm in it for real this time. That I'm not bluffing and I want to change.

In the end, I realized I'm no brilliant writer or poet so I just said what came from inside. Something that came to surprise myself as well. Something that lifted me up and something that I realized carried more meaning (personally) than I expected.

&amp;nbsp;

"I hope that the people I meet today and I have meaning in our conversations, in our work and in our companionship. I want to leave an imprint in their life as they have to me.

I realized that life once lived can not be undone, and joy once lost can not be restored. I want to change now even if things are too late to regret.

Even if it can't be permanent, I want tell someone I eternally love them. Pledge my loyalty, through good and bad. Through high and low.

Will I ever get that opportunity?
Will I ever appreciate what I have in time?

I don't know but I want to be around for all of that."

&amp;nbsp;

Thanked them and left to go back to work. 

Today was a good day. I hope you're all pushing through! 

**D-4 is on the horizon.**

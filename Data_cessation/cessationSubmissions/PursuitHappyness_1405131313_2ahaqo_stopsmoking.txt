I just smoked my first cigarette yesterday. I don't want to get hooked on to it, but now I get the urge and the temptation to smoke another one.

I was super stressed and depressed last night, ended up vaping a little green before going out to a nearby 7/11 and buying my first pack of cigarettes.  I bought a pack of marbolo opened it up and smoked a cig.  

Ever since high school I made a promise to never smoke, because that shit smells like ass.  Once I got into college, I still kept that promise...except I would now smoke green and just not touch the nicotine.  My reasoning was that the nicotine is more addictive than the green.  Slowly I got hooked on the green, but I got a vaporizer now and I use that more often.  Once in a while, I would still use a cigarette roller and roll a J, just because I enjoyed the act of holding something in my hand and smoking it.  It just felt relaxing.  

Now I broke my promise and went over the line I drew for myself and smoked a cig.  I truly loved the feeling I got yesterday from smoking a cig, maybe cause a little green went with it too and I got a full body buzz.  I wanted to only smoke a cig for whenever I was depressed or upset, but I think that would only set me on the wrong path.  

Any good advice on how to kick this urge before I get too into it?

Question about E-cigs.

Hey guys.

I quit more than a year ago and have since convinced my gf to quit as well. While I went the cold turkey route she decided to switch to E-cigs and claims that she's using a zero nicotine cartridge.
Here's my question: Do any of you have experience with these e-cigs? Does zero nicotine really mean no nicotine at all? I tried to wean myself off with e-cigs but I just felt like I was fooling myself or better yet, transferring my addiction to a new delivery system. 

She's been regular cigarette free for about 8 months but she still smokes the e-cig regularly. I'd like her to stop smoking period but every time I bring it up she gets annoyed and tells me it helps her relax. 

Should I just leave her be or push for her to give up e-cigs as well?

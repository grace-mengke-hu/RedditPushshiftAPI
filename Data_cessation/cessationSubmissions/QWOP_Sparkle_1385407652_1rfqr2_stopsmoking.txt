What starting smoking has done to me in just a little under a week.

I never realised how quickly the physical effects of smoking would take place again, but I'm actually quite surprised as odd as it sounds.

Long story short, i've had a bad couple of weeks, as you can tell from my badge I had made it 9 months before crawling back. I hit a really big low in my anxiety and depression to the point of not caring anymore, stress from University work, part time job and things going on at home just built up one after another and I had a pretty big mental breakdown. As well as fearing what I'll be doing once I've finished University! I couldn't cope with it all.

What I've noticed -

> Sore throat and the smokers cough came back within just a couple of days.

> Chest is starting to 'ache' more often as opposed to it never aching at all.

> The original triggers i.e after food cigarette and such have made a quick return.

> 'Needing' a cigarette before certain things.

> For a while I was avoiding buying my own and trying to avoid smoking at home but that kind of went downhill within just a few short days.

A part of me is still in denial that I've started smoking again, however, as I've learnt I know that I can easily quit again as the last method worked very well for me (Saying 'no' and using nicorette gum when the cravings got too unbearable).

I don't plan on quitting anytime soon, although a part of me wants to I know that with the current circumstances I'll just crawl back again, so I'm hoping that smoking is just a short term thing for me. There is just a lot, A LOT, going on right now and I'm hoping you all can understand that.

Getting the badge removed. Forgive me!

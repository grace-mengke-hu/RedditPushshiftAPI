What to do besides smoke?

Today was the first full day. I am currently caught in an endless yawn-eyeroll-slouch loop. But I'm super determined to keep going and even a piece of me has been enjoying the little pity party I've been wallowing in all day.


Anyway, I'm realizing there's some things I've literally never done without smoking before. Like roadtrips- what do you do while you're driving in stressful traffic for longer than an hour? And what about cutting the work day into pieces without cigarette breaks? Is getting drunk on red wine even enjoyable without tobacco? I'm scared to have some of these moments take me by surprise without some kind of plan in place üòê

Advice?

Any advice for someone wanting to quit? 

I'm not sure I'm strong enough, I have so much doubt in my capability to quit that I keep putting off starting. I have a perscription for chantix but I'm too broke to go get it. 

I just lost my aunt to lung cancer, I don't want to end up like her, I don't want to keep having my life revolve around these stupid things.

Any advice would be wonderful and welcome please.

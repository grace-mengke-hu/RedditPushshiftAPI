I figure today is a good milestone

#QuitNow! Since Mar 9, 2013: 
42 days smoke free,
852 cigarettes down,
$330.15 and 3 days, 13:12:00 saved! Thought day 42 would be a good checkpoint. I find myself wanting a real life quicksave in case I screw up. But I had my first back to back days without thinking about cigarettes so I will keep trucking.

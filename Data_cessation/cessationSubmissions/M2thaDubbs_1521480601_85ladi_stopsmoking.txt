I relapsed, but I jumped right back on the wagon.

Well I'm back to the beginning. But this time it's going better. Last time, I'm sad to say I didn't even make it a day. 

But I've just made it to the 38 hour mark! It's not much but it's a small win! I'm really glad to have made it over halfway through the dreaded first 72 hours.

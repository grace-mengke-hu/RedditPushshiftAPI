I will be nicotine free by the weekend!

So it's been [almost](https://i.imgur.com/elg0W1K.png) eight weeks of non smoking. Tomorrow evening at 22.00 o'clock, to be precise.  
I'll be putting on my last 7mg patch at that moment, and the day after, it'll be done. I will be nicotine free by the end of the weekend. I figured this deserved some of my attention, some reflection in a way, in case I need it at some point in the future.  

My decision to quit was a spontaneous one this time. I decided to do so in the morning, went out and bought patches after work, and smoked the last one the same evening. Threw out the remaining cigarettes, and put my lighter in a drawer for candles and stuff. Put a patch on, and done. My quit attempts in the past were always planned. This felt different from day one.  

The first six weeks I used 14mg patches, and I was a bit nervous to go to 7mg. I actually wrote about that fear [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/aqlj52/_/), and reflected on it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/arzf0v/_/).  
The cravings got a little worse after the switch, as you can see [in this picture](https://i.imgur.com/9dPdNAs.png), but it went back down after a week or so. I have to admit that the first weekend on 7mg patches was hard, I spent a lot of time around a chainsmoking friend, and me and my fiancee went to a beer garden where a lot of people smoked. So I have pushed myself a bit. That might also have something to do with it.  

But I made it through all the cravings, they all went away, it didn't matter that I didn't smoke. They went away on their own. And I love the bright side of life that is being a non smoker. I can smell so much more! I can take deep breaths. I am not harming the environment with my smoking. I am not harming the people and animals around me with my smoking. I will be saving money once I get done with the patches. Life is brilliant.  

I am sure I will face some stronger cravings when I quit using patches. I'll be sure to check in often. But I am going to do this. I am going to quit my addiction to not only cigarettes (which I have, I am a non smoker!), but also to nicotine. I will become a former nicotine addict. It is going to be tough at times, I suppose, but I can do it. Fuck cigarettes. Fuck nicotine.

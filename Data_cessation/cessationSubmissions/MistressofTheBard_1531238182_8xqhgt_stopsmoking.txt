Month 3 smoke free

I am officially 3 months smoke free. I can't believe I've made it this far without cheating (I smoked 1/2-1 pack a day for 15 years). A few things:

* I still have nightmares about smoking and wake up ashamed. 
* I'm finding there are foods that I thought I liked but don't (asparagus, margarine, avocado) and foods I thought I didn't like but do (goat cheese). 
* I can run. RUN! Like, for longer than a minute!
* I'm not constipated AT ALL anymore! I really didn't think it would be possible about 2 weeks in.
* I have so much more time to do stuff, like paint, exercise, read, eat. My hobbies have changed. I do a lot of yoga. I started acupuncture and cupping. 
* I have a new obsession with my skin. I've been on the Korean skincare kick for about 2 months and WOW my skin has never looked better. 

When my mom and aunt died this year, it really made me realize I have been taking my health for granted. Even though I loved smoking, and felt like it was a part of me, it was really my addiction talking. I am NOT a corporate dupe, I am NOT a sucker, I am NOT a sheep.

I still use my vape when I'm desperate. Soon I will no longer need that either. I'm hoping my boyfriend will also cut back on his soon too.

Props to all of you starting out! One day at a time.

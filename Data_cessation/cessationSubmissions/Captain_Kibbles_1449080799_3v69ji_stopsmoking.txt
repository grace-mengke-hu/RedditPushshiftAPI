Thanks guys

It's been 500 days since my last cigarette and I could not have done it without this sub.  I can't remember how I first stumbled upon this place, but after reading up on a few tips and trying to quit and struggling to stick with it, I eventually decided to go ahead and sign up for the badge, and boy did it help. 

I felt like I had made a commitment to everyone who was also going through the same struggle. I felt like I would let the other users and myself down if I had to go and hit that reset button.  Whenever I had a strong urge I would come here look at that badge and read posts from others until the cravings passed. 

This community really helped me make one of the best decisions of my life and for that I say thank you and keep up the good work!

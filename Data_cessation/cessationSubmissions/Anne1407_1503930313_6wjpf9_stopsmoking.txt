This morning was tough

Woke up around 830 am. Had nine missed calls by my coworker. Turned out I misread my agenda and had an early shift today (nurse). Thought that was tomorrow! So rushed into work without breakfast or anything, stressed out of my mind. When I had coffee, I wanted a smoke so bad! But I pushed through and made it past [14 days](http://i.imgur.com/VcU3eJ8.jpg) today! The afternoon was a little easier, felt I was getting more into work and the normal way of things again.  
It does feel like it is harder now, than the first few days. The cravings aren't there as often, they only strike when something happens and/or I'm really stressed, but they are much worse when they do happen. But I'm pulling through. No going back now. I'm not a smoker. But it is hard. Any tips or similar stories?

4th day

My meter on my phone tells me that I am turning over to the 4th day today at 2:30pm. The metallic taste in my mouth is pretty much gone, thankfully. I woke up ok but had to keep moving and had no coffee until I was on the road. Coffee triggers me and I'll swear off coffee the first few months if it makes this whole process easier. 

How are you guys doing to day?

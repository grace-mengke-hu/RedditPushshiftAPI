Almost 2,5 years without smoking, and then..

I stopped smoking in 2010. Just stopped without any hesitation. It was pretty easy although I had been smoking for 12 years. Few days ago I took one pack of cigs from my storage room. I have a few packs there, for no reason. So now I have smoked a few cigs just for the fun of it. I don't really feel guilty or bad about it though. Has anybody else had the same experience?

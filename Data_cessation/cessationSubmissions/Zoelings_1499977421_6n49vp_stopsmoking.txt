My mission for today is to visit and read 10 posts from people in the early stages of quitting because evidence suggests that other people can help us stay smoke free even if that means realising that you're not alone in your struggles.

I'm five days in and I'm feeling so damn good.  My only problem is I'm substituting smoking with shoving gobs of unhealthy food in my mouth.  I've been raiding the snack box at work which I know isn't good.  
I'd love to know what healthy edible snacks you guys/girls purchase/make to stave off the smoking craving/habits.
Here's to a new way of life!

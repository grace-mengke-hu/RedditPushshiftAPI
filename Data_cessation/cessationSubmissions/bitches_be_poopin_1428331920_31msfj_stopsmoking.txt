Worked out for the first time in a while today

A couple years ago I lost some weight and did the whole healthy lifestyle thing (with the exception of smoking). It was great and I felt (and looked) great! But then life happened and I went from an active job to an office job and we moved and blah blah blah I gained some weight back. Not a big deal. When I quit smoking I gained some more weight and ended up feeling just kinda meh for a while. So I decided to start a new exercise and healthy eating regime to battle the depression vampires.

Ugh, I'm so sorry I neglected you, body. 

My first workout was terrible. I had to take many breaks. But I got through it! The really mindfuck was that I had a nasty cigarette craving during my workout. When I was doing this stuff a couple years ago I would smoke a cigarette as soon as I was done with my workout. So I guess my addict was pissed we weren't going back to that. 

Whatever. I already feel more energized (and SWOLE) today and tomorrow will be better. If I can survive almost 3 months nicotine-free and Britney Spears could survive 2007, I can do this.

Let's not smoke today!

withdrawal or the flu?

Hey everyone,
it's coming up on a full three weeks now and i can't tell if i have the flu or  if the withdrawal is seriously kicking my ass, but this past week i have been feeling pretty sick. coughing, sweating, nausea, pain in the body, etc. i did go paintballing this sunday, and it was cold and muddy, so it could be the cold, but i was wondering if it's normal to see flu like symptoms as a result of nicotine withdrawal, especially on the third week. anyone?

I want to quit but wife refuses

This has been going on for over a year.  She doesn't even make an attempt anymore to quit.  

I can easily quit for a day or two with e-cigs, but when my wife is in the other room smoking, it's incredibly hard not to go have one too.  

when she quits with me, there's some kind of weird psychological effect that makes quitting so easy, but when I know she is smoking, quitting becomes 2-3 times harder throughout the day.

I've been begging and asking her to quit but she don't care.  I'll have chest pains periodically which I know is directly related to smoking and have explained this to her.  I know she would love to quit, but doesn't want to put an ounce of effort into it anymore.  I know if I dont stop I'll have a heart attack sooner than later but I've tried a ton of times and always go back because its so easy to grab one of her cigarettes.  

Even when I ask her not to smoke at home, she will still come home reeking of smoke, the cigs are in the car or her purse and it's always 1 request away from us both smoking which she is more than happy to do.  Then a weekend comes, she can't go 2 days without smoking so I'm shit out of luck.

I'm scared and frustrated but not scared enough to quit on my own completely.   worst of all, she saw her mother die of lung cancer, so it's not like she dont know the risks.

help me with suggestions for me to stop smoking without her stopping and do you have any suggestions to get me to convince her to stop?

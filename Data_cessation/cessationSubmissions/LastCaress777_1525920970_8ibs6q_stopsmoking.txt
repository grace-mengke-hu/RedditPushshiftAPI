When does this start?

Been a pack a day since ~19 and now 41. Woke up Sunday and threw the pack away and went about my day. Haven't smoked since don't really want to. This seems quite at odds with most things I've read. No cravings, no anxieties, no fog. Is this possible? Should I go to the doc and make sure I'm ok? Feel fine like the day before.  Kind of worried something is wrong that I'm not feeling anything really. Are there  cases it just doesn't hit people or is very delayed?

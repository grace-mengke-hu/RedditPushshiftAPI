Good idea to book leave for quitting?

Hello all! First time poster, I've been lurking for a couple of weeks. 

Bit of boring background first! I'm 26 years old, female, have been started smoking at 13, the habit established itself at around 15-16. I have no real idea how much I smoke a day, but I get through a 19 box over a 2/3 day period. I don't go to bars or pubs much at all these days but when I did I could easily fire through 17/18 in one night. 

Now for the good part. I think I am mentally ready to start quitting. I'm attached to the alone time my smoking gives me but I can have this time without a cigarette in my hand. I love food and it occurred to me the other week that my sense of taste isn't as vivid as it once was. Colds last longer and ALWAYS go to my chest. I overuse good perfumes to mask the smell. I have a good set of teeth, no fillings or abscesses, needed a brace as a kid but that was it. I don't want to ruin that. I get out of breath sometimes when I go up too many flights of stairs, or run for a train or something. But, at least I can high tail it when I really need to and I don't want to lose that ability. My skin has no reason to be as pimply as it is currently other than the cigs.

I've been thinking, do you guys think it's a better idea to take a week off while riding out the initial clawing cravings? Or should I quit during "normal" life so my mind knows it's happening "for real" when instead of obliging my lunchtime cig for example, I ride it out instead? I'm only worried about having to juggle the first few smoke-free days with work because it's a very new job, the people are honestly the sweetest, nicest group of people I've ever worked with and I'm still at the "first impression" stage. I don't want people thinking I'm rude if I am less calm or bubbly than I usually am. 

Any advice would be most welcome!

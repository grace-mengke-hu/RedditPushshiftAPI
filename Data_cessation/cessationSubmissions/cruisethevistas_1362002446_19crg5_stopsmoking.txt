Advice on an upcoming party this Friday

Hey all! 

So my friend is showing some art at a bar on Friday, and it's also her birthday.

I know that folks who are going will be smoking.

I am hesitant to go because I am serious about not smoking and I know that one cig leads to many more.

At the same time, I haven't seen these friends in a long time and I feel I would be missing out if I didn't go.

Do you have any tips to help me not smoke while there? Maybe I should pass this one up until I've got more time under my belt? 

Thanks all. Have a happy smoke-free Wednesday!

First day without smoking

Hi,
I decided last week to stop smoking - no special reason, just the summarized remorse of 5 years as a smoker. After searching for more information and talking to a pharmacist, I bought nicotine patches and some chewing gums.

This morning, I decided to start. So I woke up, smoked my last cigarette, and then tried to apply the patch. First critical situation approaching. Those patches do not stick! It fell off again and again, and since I am little cheap (7 patches cost around 25â‚¬, 25mg nicotine) I didnt want to open a second patch.

My fix: [see picture](http://i.imgur.com/gg2w80y.jpg). Duct-tape and a long sleeve shirt should work.

So wish me luck, right now I've spent quite accurate 100mins without smoking (usually I need one bigbox a day).

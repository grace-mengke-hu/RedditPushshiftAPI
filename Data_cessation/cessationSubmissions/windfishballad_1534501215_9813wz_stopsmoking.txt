Strange Withdrawal Symptom

I made it to my first month smoke free (minus one brief slip-up last week). I’m delighted and proud of myself. I am however having the strangest withdrawal symptom I’ve ever had. I have the taste of cigarettes stuck in my mouth, but worse than that, I can feel the smoke in my chest. Have you ever experienced that?

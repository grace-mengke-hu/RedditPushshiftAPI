Withrawal getting worse after 2 weeks?

Hi there, I quit 17 days ago at the beginning of a 10 day vacation. it was hard at first but I managed. now after 1 week back at work withdrawal symptoms are driving me crazy while working on my computer... why are the symptoms worse now even if the nicotine should have left my body long ago? what to do? thanks for any thoughts

I relapsed

I had to reset my badge. 528 days down the drain. It started as just one cigarette. "I can smoke one cigarette." I told myself. "I quit before and I can quit again!" One cigarette turned into three which turned into a pack which turned into a month of smoking which turned into three months. And not just occasionally smoking but smoking a pack a day and smoking like it was going out of style. Honestly, it felt sooooo good to smoke again. "I'm the ruler of the universe! I can smoke if I want! No one tells me what to do!" Well I got a chest infection. Sobered me up right quick. I've been using the gum which is how I quit last time and so far I'm on day 6 and not looking back.

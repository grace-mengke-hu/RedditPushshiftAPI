any good videos that aren't corny to help stop smoking?

need to help a family member quit smoking. they are on like day 3. they have medical reasons to help motivate them but a 20 year habit is intense. Can anyone recommend any good scientific  videos or documentaries about the quit smoking process? i think seeing that other people go through the same thing will help, however youtube vlogs were " to corny"

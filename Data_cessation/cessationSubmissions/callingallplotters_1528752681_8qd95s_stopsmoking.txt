Disgusted with myself

I was doing well, had a few slips in a 4 month period but bounced back, but now I’ve been drinking and smoking and I just feel like I’m tempting fate as well as taking a huge step back. And I can’t afford that, I have very little going for me. So I’m back and hoping being on here more often again will make me more accountable. 

I’m not sure if I belong here, I’m not sure of what my views are: I know I’d rather not smoke ever, but that part of me still likes it. The other way, complete substance-freeness is very difficult and when I’m not seeing any benefits it is easier to give in to hedonism and wreckless abandon. I don’t know how to change that. But here I am. For now. Hoping to see the other side over time.

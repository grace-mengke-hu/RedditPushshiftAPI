14 years today

I just noticed the date, here in Australia we use European data format (DD/MM/YY) so my quit date is actually easy to remember I became a non smoker on 01/02/03, 14 years to the day.


Of course I almost never think of smoking these days but stop by /r/stopsmoking once in a while to see how folk are doing and occasionally offer encouragement.

Firstly, I may never have done it if it wasn't for Allen Carr's book. If you're trying to stop read it or watch the video (you can find them for free download). I went from smoking 20-30 cigs a day for 18 years to zero as soon as I finished the book, it was totally painless and I just didn't want to smoke anymore, I honestly couldn't see the point any cravings I had were very mild and only lasted a couple of days. I'm not the only one, check the reviews https://www.amazon.com/Allen-Carrs-Easy-Stop-Smoking/dp/0615482155/ref=redir_mobile_desktop?_encoding=UTF8&dpID=51VFUfekFWL&dpPl=1&keywords=allen%20carr%27s%20easy%20way%20to%20stop%20smoking&pi=AC_SX236_SY340_QL65&qid=1485386761&ref=plSrch&ref_=mp_s_a_1_1&sr=8-1 I thought "I'm different" and "it won't work for me", I was wrong.

I think in the 14 years I've saved about $50,000, at this stage oof life I'm lucky that I have some savings and know they would be $50,000 less if I had continued smoking.

More to the point my health is so much better, at the time I stopped I was really noticing the effect smoking was having on me, coughing, tightness of chest and a regular, worrying soreness on one side of my thoat, all reduced quickly when I stopped and I have no remaining symptoms that I'm aware of (touching wood here).

Smoking gives you absolutely nothing and takes so much in money, health, personal hygiene (sorry to say but smokers smell bad, I know I did). 

So, if you're reading this and still smoking the best time to quit was to never start, the next best time is now, I wish I'd stopped sooner. Give Allen Carrs book a shot, it probably saved my life.

Good luck all, the journey can be fun, its still one of my proudest achievements, you have nothing to loose and everything to gain.

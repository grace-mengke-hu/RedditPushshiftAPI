I had a cigarette just now

It's been 16 days since i last smoked. I've only been smoking for a year. I found a cigarette in my drawer and decided to smoke it. I didn't enjoy it, I was craving for a smoke but it just made me feel sick. I don't even want to reset my badge because, well, i don't think i'll ever buy a pack again. I'm jittery and my stomach feels horrible. Is this good? I don't even feel bad that I smoked it, I feel better that i don't want to do it again.

Maybe I can move on to other addictions, caffeine, diet, sleep disorders, forever aloneness :)

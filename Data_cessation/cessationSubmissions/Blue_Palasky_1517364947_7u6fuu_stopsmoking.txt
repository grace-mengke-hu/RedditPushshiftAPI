Obligatory Check-in

Hey fellow quitters.  I’ve smoked for 18 years, and figured now is the best time to quit.  I’m currently in some sort of brain fogged-constant headache-nauseous hell.  But, I’m determined and hanging strong. 

I caught sinusitis a couple of days afterwards, so tomorrow will be my first full day back at work.  That is where I do my majority of smoking, and I’m as perplexed as a lot of you with what to do with myself during breaks.  

Anyways, I’m here and I’ll be checking in occasionally.

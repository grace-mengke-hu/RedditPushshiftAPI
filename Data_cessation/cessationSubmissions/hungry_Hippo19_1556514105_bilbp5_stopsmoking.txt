Take the small victories each and every day, we can all do this

I just want to say thank you to everyone in the sub. When I made my post last week it was because I wasn't sure that I could do this on my own. I had spent months, everyday looking at everyone else's progress jealous and simultaneously angry with myself. I had quit so many times, telling myself this was my last pack and i'm not going to buy another one tomorrow. Yet each and every time I failed. Then I would spend time in this community and the positivity always gave me hope. I know one week is just the beginning. The road has already been bumpy as hell and its going to get worse before it gets better, but you all have taught me that every minute we don't cave is a victory in and of itself. NOT ANOTHER PUFF, NO MATTER WHAT.

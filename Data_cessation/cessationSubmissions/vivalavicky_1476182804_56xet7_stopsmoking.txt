Green Smart Living Ecig and other alternatives

After 8 years of smoking I've decided to quit. I am weening myself off of the real thing using the Green Smart Living Ecig. So far so good. It helps the mental addiction when I'm used to smoking but it's not as good as the real thing so I'm hoping in a couple of weeks I'm done all together. Has anyone used an Ecig to quit smoking? And by that I mean stopped using the Ecig too. I noticed that Green Smart Living does contain nicotine so I'm not sure it's going to be all that healthy. Has anyone used the herbal cigarettes? Thanks!

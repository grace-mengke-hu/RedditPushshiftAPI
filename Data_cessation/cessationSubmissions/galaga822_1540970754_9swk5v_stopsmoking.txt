Does hypnosis work?

I've been trying to quit for the last 3 years. Been smoking for 18 years, 18 years too long. The longest I've ever made it was a month. I've tried patches, gums, writing notes to myself, cold turkey, warm turkey (cig in the morning only), cessation classes, yelling at myself, diversion tactics. In the end, I always end up where I started, back to a pack-a-day. In all honesty, my brain's desire for that shit is far beyond my ability to say no for any extended duration of time. The only thing I can think of at this point is getting my brain to do what it needs to do by convincing it that it doesn't want to smoke anymore. Enter hypnosis. :) Has anyone here ever tried it? If so, what were the results? I'm grasping at straws at this point, obviously.

just shy of two months free cold turkey, but does vaping/e-cigs count against that?

I purchased a popular e-cig tonight because I’ve been getting the itch again.  I’m now a little nervous to actually use the damn thing... So many articles state differing opinions on their health factors, but what do you think? Can I still call myself smoke free? Did you switch to alternates as well and did they make you go back to cigarettes?

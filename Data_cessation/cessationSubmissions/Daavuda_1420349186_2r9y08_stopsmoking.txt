46 days but can't control the urge now.

I didn't wanted to quit smoking forever because that's how my body works and supports me to quit for few days. I used to quit for a week every 2 months without any hassles and would come back to smoking again. But this time I have put 45 days for myself to stop smoking and today is 46th day and I want to continue this for another 44 more days making it 100, but my body is giving up and urge is kind of high. Coming here to seek help.

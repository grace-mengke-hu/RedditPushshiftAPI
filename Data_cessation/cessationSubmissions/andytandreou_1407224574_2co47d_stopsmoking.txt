This interesting fact may motivate you to stop smoking.

I heard it from a TV show that it only takes 3 seconds for us to judge a face as attractive or not. I think the show was on the Discovery Channel. True or not, I see this from my own personal experience, I usually look (and judge) for about 1-2 seconds before I claim that a person is cute/sexy/pretty or whatever.

FURTHERMORE I CAN ASSUME 

That given this incredibly small amount of time we give other people, we will tend to focus on the KEY characteristics of their face. I.E. Their Eyes, Teeth and Skin. These three are the parts of our face mostly affected by cigarettes. Our skin turns grey, our teeth turn a disgusting shade of yellow and the white of our eye turns into a mess of patchy veins and weird colors. 

TL;DR - People look at us for 3 seconds before deciding if we are attractive. Cigarettes destroy any chance we have.

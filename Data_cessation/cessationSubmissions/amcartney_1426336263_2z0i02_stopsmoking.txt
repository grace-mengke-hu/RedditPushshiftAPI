Does it get easier from here?

It's been four days since I was a smoker. This time for some reason has the been easiest, usually by the end of the second day my cravings are overwhelming and Im in a foul mood, and I end up smoking. But this time, I haven't once seriously considered going to the store to buy cigarettes. So I've made it this far, 4 days. Does it get easier from here? If so, this will be a breeze.

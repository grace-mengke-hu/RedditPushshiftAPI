Fighting badly with husband! Trying so hard not to smoke

Hi! I am 25 days smoke free which is so crazy for me. I am past the main physical withdrawal, although I've been having nicotine gum every so often Bc I've been under sever stress. My husband and I are not doing good. We love each other like crazy, but lately we are fighting like mad. We've always had a passionate relationship, but ever since I quit smoking, it has majorly intensified. One night he even slept at a friends house. First time ever in 9 years. I cannot believe I beat it and did not smoke during the most stressful time I've ever endured with him. But I'm worried. I can't cope with my emotions and stress now. I'm constantly angry. I find myself unable to deal with my emotions properly. When will this calm down? He was so amazing the 1st week, but now doesn't want to heat about my blaming quitting smoking - which it really is. He has no addictions and doesn't understand - please help! I love him very much and also don't want to go back to smoking. Although this is sick, I know we would stop fighting if I did... Really struggling...

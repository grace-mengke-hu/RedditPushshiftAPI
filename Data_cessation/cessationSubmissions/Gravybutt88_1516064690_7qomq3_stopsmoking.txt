Whoa my anger and being annoyed at everything

So im one month smoke free (i do vape at 6mg but lately not too much) and since Friday im a totally different person for some reason. Im just plain angry and grumpy. Nothing is making me happy and literally everything annoys me and makes me snap instantly. Ive been having some heavy cravings but haven’t given in. 

Is this normal ?! Hopefully it’ll pass. I keep waking up every morning since Friday hoping to not feel like this, but ive been sleeping like junk. Waking up craving. Ugggggh

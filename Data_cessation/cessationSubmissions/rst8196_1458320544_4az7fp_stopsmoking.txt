My story. Some other stories.

Started smoking when I was 15 or 16, do not even remember.
Occasionally I did not smoke for some periods of time, but always was back to smoking a pack a day.
I can count around 5-6 more than one month attempts to quit. I hope irreversible damage to my body is not too bad.

Even 23-24 years old I was feeling that smoking is killing me. I hated myself but still continued smoking. I did not care about money or harm to others. 

Last July I threw away all of my tobacco. Only time I was smoking was one night when accidentally got so drunk that I do not even remember that I did it. Only reason I know about it is that I woke up with a pack of cigarettes (17/20). Threw it away and did not smoke since.

But this story is not only about myself. I have been renting part of the house from an old lady, she is 80 years old. She works night shifts as a nurse, and lived on coffee and cigarettes. Now she is living on coffee only! After seeing me quit, and talking to me she did quit too after 65 years of smoking! She did not smoke for half a year. Sometimes she asks me if I miss smoking, but she is not smoking.

I did not plan this to happen, just accidentally helped another person. Hope I can make my father quit. Hope I can help some of my friends. We can all make a difference, I guess.

Thank you for your time, sirs. Good luck in your lives.

Made it through my annual Super Bowl party!!!

I have a Super Bowl party every year for whoever wants to come.  Most years I spend the evening sitting outside smoking, bbqing and discussing the game with my friends.  I was able to have a good time, drink and let them all make trips outside to have cigarette without giving in! No bbqing this year, I cooked inside which helped a lot.

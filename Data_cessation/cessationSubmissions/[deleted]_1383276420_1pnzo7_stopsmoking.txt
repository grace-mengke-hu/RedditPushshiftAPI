At it again

Quitting yet again. Not just cigarettes. I'm taking Halloween weekend to expel all my vices. Today was the last day for cigs and amphetamines. Can't drink after Saturday. Can't smoke pot after Sunday. I have just come to the conclusion that all these little poisons are tied together for me, and I improve my chance of breaking the cig habit especially by completely changing my routine. Wish me luck!

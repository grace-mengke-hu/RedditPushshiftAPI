Haven't had a smoke in 63 days, how I did it.

Well first of all I would like to let you all know I started smoking cigarettes when I was 17 years old. I always smoked a pack a day until the last 2 years when i started smoking 2 packs a day. I am 28 years old now so I had been smoking for 11 years! I quit smoking using the nicotine patch method, I have been off the patch for a week now. I never thought I could honestly do it without some help weening off the nicotine with the aid of patches, gum, etc. My wife does not smoke but my workplace is full of smokers and all of my co workers constantly going outside for smokes and conversations. I found that most of the quitting process was being ready to give it up. You would not believe how much I have been tested in the last 63 days to go to the store and buy a pack. I have had everything from major family drama stress to deaths in the workplace, and every time I have been tempted I realize how smoking won't make me feel better because in fact it will make me feel worse. I also give credit to my kids (who are both 6) for giving me the drive to quit. For those of you trying to quit look at all the benefits: no ashes, no stinky smoke, no smokers teeth, no coughing or weezing, no lung cancer, smells are regained, taste is regained, save $$$$ and save years of your life. Good luck to all of you

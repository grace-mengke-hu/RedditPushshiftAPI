Exams in a week, quit now or wait until after

Hi guys,

I've been trying to quit on and off for about the last 6 months. It's been going pretty well (relatively). I didn't smoke for a total of 3 months these past 6 months.

My strategy is to just keep quitting, and don't be too harsh if I fall back into the habit. If I keep quitting, I'm bound to stop for good is my thought.

The actual problem I'm facing now is that I've got exams next week. Since I'm really bad at planning, I've quit since yesterday and am already starting to feel the symptoms of withdrawels.

These exams have priority and I feel I should just buy a pack, try to last with it until after the exams and then quit. 

Any thoughts? I might not be asking anything really here, I'm pretty sure I'll buy a pack since I can't focus at all right now. I guess I just wanted to tell this to someone.

Thanks for reading

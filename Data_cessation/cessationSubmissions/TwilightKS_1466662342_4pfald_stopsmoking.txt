Day 3 almost over!

Oh thank you thank you thank you for exercise!  I go to planet fitness at least 1 time a day so far and it's really helped with the cravings and it's cheap too lol 20 bucks a month.  I've lost 2lbs so far and I can breathe again.  It's not so hard to breathe during it anymore.

Beyond that drinking a lot of tea too, I know they say water but meh tea is as good and with sugar substitute instead of sugar. 

The only thing that I wish would go away is this anxiety, I keep wanting to go go go and always wanting to do something!  I can't seem to relax and enjoy life, any suggestions?

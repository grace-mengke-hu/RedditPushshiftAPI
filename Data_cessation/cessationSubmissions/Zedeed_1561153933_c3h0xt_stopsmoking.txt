Is setting a date better?

I decided to stop smoking two days ago but today I gave into my urges and had a cigarette I feel awful because i purchased a vape pen to help myself through the process, I have quit before, four times in fact and it was super easy but this time I had really bad withdrawals, I had an idea to quit on my birthday which is next month and I feel that will help as it is an important day obviously, but will that work and does anybody know if that will help me?

Quitting again

Last year I managed to quit for about 2 months before going back to the cancer sticks like a whipped puppy. It was really nice after I got over the worst parts.

What nailed me was stress in the end. When I quit I had just moved back in with my parents temporarily while I worked some shit out (just lost my job and a bunch of other BS happened). In a way I took a kind of sabbatical away from it all for a while, so stress was minimal until I moved back out, and got back around my co-workers and friends who basically all smoke making it too easy to slide right back into it. 

After a whole year now I'm doing it again for all forms of smoking of anything, primarily because my chest has been feeling shitty and it is actually scaring me a bit. I don't have medical insurance and I don't want it to turn into an expensive, long term problem. I fear it may already be, but I'm giving it a few days and see if the feeling gets better or worse. It definitely felt worse when I smoked anything, I hope its just irritated. 

I took what remained of my pack and burned them ritual style last night in a metal bin. All in all I've been trying to reduce sources of stress before this, as constant anxiety can kill you just as well as cigarettes can. 

Though the true irony is that two sources of stress for me have been (1) My health as a man in my early 30s after plenty of abuses in the last 10 years, and (2) money, which smoking is causing both to go out the window. This in addition to weed which I also smoked regularly, which is a big time/motivation/money sink that is definitely not getting me where I want to go either. 

Anyway, thanks for listening Reddit, cheers to a healthier and richer life!

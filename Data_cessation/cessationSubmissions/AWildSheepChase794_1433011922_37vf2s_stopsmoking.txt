Drinking is my quitting downfall

So here's the deal- I only smoke (except for the very rare occasions) when drinking. All of my friends smoke and we only go to bars that allow smoking. It's just too tempting and easy to keep smoking. 
It also doesn't help that I actually do like smoking. I just hate smelling like an ash tray. I hate feeling like death in the morning. And I hate all the wasted money.
So tonight I only have 5 cigs left and I will be going out to the bars. I'm telling myself that I won't buy another pack but I always say that... then I get drunk and that goes out the window.
We'll see how this goes, I guess! If I manage to resist buying another pack after these last 5 than tomorrow will be day 1.

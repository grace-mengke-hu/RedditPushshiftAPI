Smoking when you're depressed

I recently quit smoking for a month and ended up going back to it. I also have bipolar 2 and depressive episodes are a major factor in my life. I am currently on the patch and am feeling pretty good at the moment, but this could quickly fade.  What got me smoking again this last time was a depressive episode. Its so difficult to keep yourself smoke free when you are depressed and don't care about yourself. I felt depressed and my first stop was going to the gas station for a pack of smokes. Its really the only thing that boosts my mood and has kept me sane since I was diagnosed. Has anyone else had this issue? How did you cope with it? Did you find a replacement that makes you feel good?

Nine days.

Hey /r/stopsmoking. 

I haven't posted in a few days because I haven't had access to the internet. I quit awhile back for two years, then relapsed, then for 119 days, then I reset my badge last week due to another relapse. Back at 9 days. Not much, but I am currently feeling no urges. 

Thanks for all the support!

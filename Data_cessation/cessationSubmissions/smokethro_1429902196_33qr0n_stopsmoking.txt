Tobacco is a weird drug.

I quit smoking few weeks ago. (maybe a month?) I've completely lost my fucking memory. At first I was haunted by dreams in which I was smoking. Those lucid fucking dreamsl; when you realize that you don't smoke anymore and dream instantly becomes lucid (hey, if you want to start lucid dreaming, quit smoking, I fucking guarantee you will lucid dream like a motherfucker)  
So that shit went away or just became part of my reality. Now my reality is like a dream. I started doing reality checks just to keep my mind safe. Smoking does nothing for you, I agree with Carr here, but I feel so messed up after quitting. If you ask me what I was doing two days ago, I won't asnwer you coz I have no fucking idea.

 I hope this shit will end at some point. I know I'm not going to smoke ever again. I would rather fucking die than surrender to this evil plant.

I'm not sure about the point of that rant. Don't smoke, i guess? But that's bullshit. If you're reading this, you either already quit and looking for motivation to stay away from tobacco or you're thinking about quitting. My point is this: I'm in hell right now and I'll choose this fucking hell over surrender every day for the rest of my life. Screw health and money - we're gonna die anyway. But I'm dying as a free man, not a slave! I'm drunk, so no editing will be done. Peace, friends! Fuck tobacco! 

FREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEDOM.

I said NO to nicotine today!

I know this sounds small but I was offered a vape of some nicotine today and I said no! I quit over 3 years ago but I made the conscious decision to stay quit even after three years. Admittedly, I thought about it for half a second: "Its been three years! It's ok to have a puff...its not even a cigarette..." But I did not do it. Because, even after three years, I know it is not ok to even have a puff. Because I want to stay quit. And, because I said no, I stayed quit today! And I'm proud.

This is just a reminder to stay strong and stay quit no matter where you are in your journey! Little victories still feel great!

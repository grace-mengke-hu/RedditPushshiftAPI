2 months tabacco free / 22 years old smoking since 8th grade (about 10 years)

If there is someone out there about my age that started smoking in early school years trust me you can do it! You can quit!  
I was smoking 1-2 packs a day bought the juul - quit instantly. Its kinda hard in my country to get pods and on a night out I went back to the cigarettes for a few hours and the next day I bought a vape and started vaping.  
Starting with 18 mg nic and slowly now getting to the lowest nicotine level (3mg) and pretty soon planning on going nicotine free!   
Don't wait for the perfect day or think that you need/have to smoke.   
No one needs to smoke.   
//If anyone is interested Im using the X-Priv Baby Kit + Q2 coils! The juice is forest fruit flavored from a local store .. I don't think its a well known brand or something =)

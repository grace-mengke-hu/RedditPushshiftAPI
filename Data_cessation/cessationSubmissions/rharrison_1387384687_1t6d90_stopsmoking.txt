Long-term psychoses

"Cravings" are discussed on here quite a bit, and it seems that there is a lot of literature devoted to overcoming this sort of feeling. As a person who is on their 15th quit attempt, I find these brief "cravings" quite easy to overcome. What my concern is (and where I always fail) are the paranoid, depressed, nervous, psychoses that occur a week or two after cessation and continue for who knows how long. These sorts of feelings last all day or for multiple days.

At more than a week and less than a month (usually) I run into these paranoid episodes; where I am basically having an anxiety attack all day. All of my "craving" suppression activities (exercise, gum, fruit juice, deep breathing) do not affect this feeling. The only thing that seems to cure these is a night's sleep. 

The other issue I have usually occurs after the one month point, and may be unique to me because I used to take medication for it. I feel depressed. All day, every day, forever. I don't wan't to do anything at all. Get out of bed, anything. I haven't gotten this far in a while, but I know it's coming. The last time I quit for more than a week, I ran into this depression, and found it incurable.

Until this year I had given up on quitting for about four years. I am giving my fourth quit attempt this year an earnest try, but confident is certainly not a word I would use to describe how I feel. Is there anyone who can provide some useful insight or counsel about these issues? If I don't get through this time I am going to attempt with drug therapy.

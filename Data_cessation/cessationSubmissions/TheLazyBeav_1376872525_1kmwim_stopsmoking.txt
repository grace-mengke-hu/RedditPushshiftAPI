Friend of ours stage 4 lung cancer metastasized to the brain

My battle with cigarettes has been going on for a few years now. Trying to quit, then quitting quitting. You know the drill. I got an electronic cigarette about 2 months ago and I quit for a week, then started smoking again despite how easy it was to stop smoking. Friday a friend of my boyfriends that we've spent many a Friday night hanging out with got diagnosed with cancer. The story is just so messed up. I had no idea. No one had any idea. He just fell down last Friday and got taken to the ER. Immediately hospitalized in ICU and apparently it's metastasized to his brain. Large mass in lung, brain as well as cancer cells in other organs. Floored me. He may never come out of this. He doesn't even know where he is. We had conversations about quitting and he said that he tried for 2 years and he just thought about a cigarette the whole time. No desire to quit. 50 years old and terminal. I don't want this to be me. I haven't smoked a cigarette since. I've got my electronic cigarette and I'm going to step down off this as well. I no longer have any desire to smoke cigarettes.

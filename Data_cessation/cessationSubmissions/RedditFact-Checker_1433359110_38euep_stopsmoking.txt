My First 250 Days - A Quick Thank You

In the first difficult days of my quit, this sub really helped keep me on track.  I appreciated all the posts from quitters who were struggling, making it, just starting out.  The tips and questions gave me a solid context for my own experience.  I especially appreciated all the comments and support - there is something about anonymous-to-anonymous kindness that really hits home for me.  So, thank you, quitters, for this sub!

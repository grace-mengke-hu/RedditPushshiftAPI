3 days in

Feeling pretty lethargic on my 3rd day without smokes. Didn't sleep very well last night, kept waking up through out the night which never happens. Not feeling super motivated at work and my stomachs been sour for about 36 hours.  Still doesn't make me want a cigarette. The smell of co workers smoking makes me more sick feeling

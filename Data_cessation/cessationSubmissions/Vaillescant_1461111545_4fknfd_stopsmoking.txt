It's my first try, when can i expect things to get better ?

I've stopped smoking 21 days ago, the first few days were fairly easy but now my mood seems worse, I get very obsessed over petty things, i argue on subjects i don't care about and i sometimes have this strange feeling in my throat, like i'm very "sad".

I started smoking when i was a teenager, i'm young and i was hoping to repair the damage by quitting early but the change in mood is very unsettling, i did not expect it.

I've already started to notice improvement in my physical health, which i'm very happy about since i workout a lot (cardio/weight lifting), the slight cough in the morning is already gone too. I try to keep my mind off the cigs by working on a few projects, but the more time is passing by the worst i feel about my chances of success though, like life is never going to be "as good" as before.

I feel weak and stupid for letting a substance influence my life so much, it's 2AM right now where i'm from (France) and still i cannot find sleep.
Weird thing is, no matter what happens to me i rarely complain, but with this, compared to reading most of you i feel worthless.

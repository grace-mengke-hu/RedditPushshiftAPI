Decided to quit

Today I decided to officially quit smoking.  I've smoked on and off since I was 16. I'm 22 now. It had always been really easy for me to just cold turkey quit in the past. I'd quit one day and have no problem not touching a cigarette for a year.  So when I would pick up smoking again I never thought it was a big deal, I'd just quit when I wanted to. Well its much harder to quit when you have all the stresses of adulthood. I tried to quit when I was 19 and pregnant with my son but my dr actually told me to keep smoking One or two a day to keep the stress off as it was more damaging to my baby than cigarettes. So I kept smoking.  Decided to quit when my son was born.  Did fine until I went back to work two weeks after his birth and during the holidays (I work in retail). Went straight back to smoking to keep my sanity. It was exhausting working all day and coming home to an infant at night.  

Well since then I've smoked between 3-6 a day.  

But I've decided I'm done smoking.  The taste of it makes me sick and I'm sure the smell isn't much better.  Plus I want to live a good healthy life for my two year old son. 

My husband is also quitting so this makes for a very cranky household.  

I guess I just need somewhere with tips on how to get thru it without a break down.  Its still the holidays and I still work in retail but I'm just done. 

Tips and advice welcome.  :)

Is this is a legitimate Reason to start again?

So I have a couple of important exams/presentations due to 2-3 weeks. I used to smoke a lot while working and for the love of god, I can't seem to concentrate at all. I'm thinking about getting a pack and trying to quit again when it's all over and I have like a month off. Is this a legitimate reason or is it just my brain trying to trick me?

This is day one

Fuck cigarettes. I actually applied for a badge and never posted. I looked at the badge last night and it was on 223 days. That's when I was originally all "I'm done!" and now here I am. I fucking hate addiction, but I know I am stronger than it as I quit drinking two years ago, and yesterday was my anniversary. 

So since I am now two years sober, it's time to kick this shit to the curb where it belongs. I'm sick of having bad breath, wasting money, hiding it from people, and being a slave to a goddamn engineered cash machine.

For today, and the rest of my week, whenever I come to the times when I'd normally smoke I'm just going to go for a walk and breath fresh air instead. I also have some toothpicks to chomp on. 

I can do this - I will do this. Thank you everyone for your support!

Quitting starting today!

I've been a wreck the past couple months making alot of personal mistakes in my life and smoking was one of them.

I want to clean up my act and stop smoking. 

I want to become a better person and make healthy decisions for both who I am as a person and for my body.

I am a runner. I can feel the smoke hurting my lungs, my joints, and my overall health. I want to quit so I can run better and be healthy.

I am bored when I smoke. I would rather do something more interesting than smoke.

I want to live a long, healthy life not dependent on cigarettes.

I want to save money. I don't want to waste another dollar on these goddamn cigarettes and lighters.

I don't think cigarettes look cool anymore. They are a disgusting habit and it looks terrible on girls. 

I want to quit. I had two cigarettes today but I want to start quitting NOW. 

I'm going to focus on my work and my career and my health from now on. I hope that everyone else in this sub can also quit as well. Stay strong!

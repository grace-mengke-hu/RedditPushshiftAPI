One Month Smoke Free Today!

Thanks to this community, /r vaping, and nicotine patches, I'm one month smoke free today!  
I haven't cheated, or had a single puff in one month so I'm proud. :)  

Im still on patches, vape 0mg nicotine liquid, and use sugar free hard candy.
Maybe it is the NRT but I have not had many cravings at all. When I do I just vape a bit when I can.  
I'm doing what works for me with all the different replacements because for me its more about the actual habit than the nicotine.  
I was a 2-3 pack a day smoker at my heaviest for about 15-20 years give or take. I actually just bought the bulk of my e liquid, a 6 month to a year supply, and spent the same as I would have in one month of smoking!  
My wife and I had our first child four years ago and I should have quit then but I was just procrastinating and putting it off. As my daughter grew, I felt I was just taking time away from her.  
I actually have 0 desire to ever go back to smoking, I will just vape if it gets stressful.  
Thanks to my family, friends and this community for making it easier for me. Much appreciated!

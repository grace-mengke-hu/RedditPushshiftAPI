lungs hurt after quitting smoking?

so, i haven't exactly quit 100% yet. i'm down to 2 cigs a day and i vape when i'm not smoking cigs. i vape 3mg nicotine juice. i smoked cigarettes for about 3 years smoking a pack a day. i notice my lungs are hurting slightly and at times it's a little hard to breathe in. nothing that leaves me feeling like i'm choking though it just feels like my lungs are constricted. i've started hacking up flem and stuff, which i know happens when you quit smoking. is the lung pain normal though? it's not debilitating, but it's noticeable enough to make me think about it.

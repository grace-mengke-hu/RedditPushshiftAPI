Want to stop hookah smoking but can't...

I don't smoke cigarettes or cigars but only hookah, usually 1 time per week maybe twice in some cases, the problem is all my friends smoke hookah so they are the ones that "put me on the system", of course my family doesn't know, I would like to stop this addiction but the amount of persons around myself that smoke is incredible that it seems I can't do anything, sure it's very relaxing to go after college and esp. after an exam to smoke for an hour or two but i'm afraid for my health and for the fact that I would not have the possibility to hangout with my friends... thanks for reading. ( this is my first post in this subreddit)

For the Gazillionth time

I don't understand that by the grace of God I can be clean and for 30 years but smoke the whole time of my sobriety. I slip from from depression and anxiety every time. I cant take medication for it as I wake in the middle of the night thinking someones knocking at my front door. Gong to throw out the last of my smokes now, cold turkey here we come Semper Fidelis

Three months since I quit. Still have daily cravings. Getting frustrated.

HI all

Never posted here before. Hope this is allowed. 

I stopped smoking cold turkey on September 8, 2014. I had smoked for almost 6 years, since I was 18. Started slowly, at the end I was up to close to a half pack a day. 

I imagined that when I quit I would start to feel better, but I really don't. I feel about the same. 

I have had cravings since the day I quit. I don't feel like that much time has passed.

Most of what keeps me going is just knowing how far I have come. More than wanting to not smoke, I don't want to waste the last three months of effort. I do want to smoke though. 

Sometimes I half-seriously think that I must be sleep-smoking or something. It's not going how I expected. I thought I would feel better and I thought it would get easier. 

Thanks for any advice.

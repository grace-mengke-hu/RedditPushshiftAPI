The urge will test your will

Well, I am glad this is over, and so happy, that it happened almost at midnight local time.
I was so happy that I withheld my temptations on Friday, which was by far the worst day so far, And had no cravings on Saturday, Sunday and almost all Monday.
I got in to an argument with my wife, and usually I would go out for a couple of smokes  to calm myself down, however now it was not an option, because I do not have cigarettes, and all of the shops nearby are closed. 

But it is not that I couldn't get any smokes, where the essence of this post lays. The urge already took over me and started to whisper that this is the only exit from this situation - to go outside, walk 3/4 of a mile and buy cigarettes, and this wouldn't be my fault, it would be my wife's fault. 

I took my jacket, walked out of the house, carried out the garbage bin and thought, what an asshole I am and that I should be more prepared for the situations where there is some unease feelings and that I have been blessed that  I have not encountered them before in other conditions. 

Could you share your toughest situations in the first few months, since I believe a lot of us area or have been struggled whenever encountering a new unplanned (bad) situation of our lives.

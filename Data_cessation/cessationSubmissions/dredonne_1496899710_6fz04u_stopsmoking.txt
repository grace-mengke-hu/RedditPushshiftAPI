I am quitting during an exchange program

I am currently doing an exchange program in Chile for one semester. My girlfriend, who never liked the fact that I smoked, asked me yesterday about my smoking habit. 
It was the first time I thought about the fact how much more I was smoking in Chile than I was back home. 
Since I didn't speak a lot of Spanish, and sure ass hell not Chilean, during my first weeks it was hard to have conversations and very tyring following classes. A cigarette seemed like a little moment of piece. So, as soon as I could not follow up on a conversation or had a break during classes, I would light one up.

Skip to present: 4 months in Chile and I have only one month left before I'll see my girlfriend again. Everything is going smoothly! I'm having great conversations with a lot of new friends, I have been travelling around, doing sports... overall having an amazing time! But... I've kept smoking the same amount of cigarettes as I did during my first weeks here. 
So, I decided to leave this habit behind and come back to my friends and family as a non-smoker! Boy, are they in for a surprise!

First 24h are almost over. It has not been easy, but keeping strong! Let's do this!

Vamos, w√©on!

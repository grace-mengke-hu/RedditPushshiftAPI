Day one, and damn proud of it.

I'm a college student, and smoked slightly less than half a pack a day for about 3 years.  I am home right now for thanksgiving break; since my parents don't know I smoke, and I hate sneaking behind their backs, I decided this would be a good week to quit.  I spent the whole day with the 'rents and was fine, surprisingly didn't have a huge craving for a long time.  Then we went to dinner, I had a massive burger and a few beers (BTW, "Ron's place" in Kenosha WI is fucking awesome).  I probably don't have to explain that cigs are sooooo good after food, and even better when you're a little drunk.  Fortunately I made it, and I have gone 33 hours without any nicotine.  It's not that long, but it is still an accomplishment that I am proud of.

TLDR: I have made it 33 hours without nicotine.  huzzah.

edit: words are hard.

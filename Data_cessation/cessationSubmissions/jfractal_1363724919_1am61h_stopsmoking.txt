Can someone who is farther along walk me through what to expect from withdrawals?  I am on day 4 right now, and it is getting harder to stay on-track.  How long did the withdrawals last for you?

Hello, I quit smoking 4 days ago, and have been going cold turkey.  It was easier during the weekend, but now that I'm back at work, these withdrawals are really starting to affect my productivity.  I basically feel anxious, and like my skin is crawling.  It is hard to concentrate, and it feels like the walls are closing in around me.  I'm curious as to what others have experienced, and how long it lasted.

I have the facts, just lack wisdom..

I've quite twice before for five-year stretches only to screw it up by having that "one" cig.  I've quite cold turkey and just powered through it all.

I've read Alan Carr, I know I'm simply addicted to a compound, I know it's eating me alive, that any objective perspective shows that I'm getting nothing out of it.  It's costing me a fortune in money, well being, and self respect.

Even though I want to be done with this idiocy I find that I'm caving with even the mildest of cravings.  Something's missing.  I guess, even given the above, I'm somehow not ready to quit.  But I keep pouring water on remaining cigs at the end of the night, swearing "this is it."

How am I so weak?  So comfortable with this damaging behavior?  It's like I'm in a bad relationship and content to be abused.

Somewhere inside a part of me believes that smoking is still *having something*.  Like it might be a horrendous addiction but it's *my* horrendous addiction.  I know that's just the addiction perpetually grasping, clinging but.. I can't seem to translate this knowledge into action.  It sucks.

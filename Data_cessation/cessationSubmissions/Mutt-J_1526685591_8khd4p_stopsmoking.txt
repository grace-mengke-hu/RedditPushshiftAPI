Almost 3 weeks in, new triggers are killing me!

Hi, newly created account after lurking for a while.  11-year, 5-10/day smoker who quit by accident 17 days ago due to a trip I took with a group who didn’t know I was a smoker.  I’ve been careful about hiding it around a lot of people out of shame for years.  I figured I would do what I always do, and buy a pack on holiday and sneak out to smoke some, feeling guilty all trip, but I just didn’t?  I was able to chalk up my early quitting symptoms to jet lag, etc.  

Now that I am home, I am having a harder time than I did the first week!  Now that I *could* smoke whenever I want, I have to remind myself not to, constantly.  I feel like even my physical symptoms (cough, anxiety) are back just like they were the 2nd day!

Will this happen with every new triggering situation?  I imagine every first smoke-free concert, bonfire, drunken night out, heart to heart with my roommate in the garden, finals week... will remind me that I want to smoke, but when will the cigarettes loosen their grip???

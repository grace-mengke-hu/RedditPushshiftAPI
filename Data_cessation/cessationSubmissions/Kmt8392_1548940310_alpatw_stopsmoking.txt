I’m one day in...

I made it through yesterday, but wow today is SO. MUCH. WORSE. I’m feeling very very spacey, like my brain is just in a fog, and when people talk to me I can’t even listen to what they’re saying. Anyway to help with this? Also I am ANGRY, and I mean ANGRY, at even the tiniest little things, and it’s like I notice it’s ridiculous but I can’t help it? And it also almost feels good to let that anger out, even if it’s on people who don’t deserve it.

This still sucks.

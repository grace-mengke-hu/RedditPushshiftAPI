Stupid Decisions

I hate smoking.  But I can't escape it. I grew up in a smokers house, hating going to school reeking of it and swearing I would never smoke. Yet here I am, 35 and 17 years of smoking under my belt. I quit with all my pregnancies, and for 2 years because of my health, yet I'm smoking again. I will quit for 5 days, most recently because of bronchitis...again...and then feel better, have a few drinks....Bam. Smoke again. I hate being so stupid. What works,  what have you done? I assume I should probably give up drinking for a while because I don't want to when I'm sober. Thoughts, suggestions?

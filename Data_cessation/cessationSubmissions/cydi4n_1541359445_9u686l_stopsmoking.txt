137 Day yet still struggling

The moment weather started to get cold my addiction pops right back again.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 22 years old male who started smoking 3 years ago. Since I've only smoked like 2-2.5 years i don't see my accomplishment as a big thing. I believe my brain didn't get attached to the nicotine like other actual smokers. Boy I was wrong. I read something called seasonal triggers the other day, basically whenever it's getting cold outside I wanna smoke. This is especially bad because i am using the memory of smoking in the hot weather in order to stay away from smokes. I used to hate smoking in the hot weather like 30-35+ Celsius. Whenever i feel like i want to smoke i think of those times i smoked in the hot weather. I cannot use those memories anymore cause i know it's cold outside and actually cold inside too. It's not that effective as it used to be. The more and more cold it gets outside the harder it is for me to stay away from smoking. I am almost sure i won't start smoking but the cravings are getting stronger and it's just not being easy on me. I feel like I've quit smoking 1 week ago not 137 days ago. Even thinking about smoking excites me. You probably know the feel when you didn't smoke like 4-5 hours because you weren't able to (of course you should be also awake) and you think hey i can smoke right now. Instant heart rate up, joy that you are going to smoke again etc. That happens whenever i step outside and doesn't go away at least for 40 min.

The sad part is none of my methods working either. Gums, drinking tea, running a little bunch of other methods. None. It just suddenly goes away after like 40-45 min

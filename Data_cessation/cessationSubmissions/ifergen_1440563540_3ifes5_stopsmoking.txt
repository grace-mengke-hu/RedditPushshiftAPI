Today is my quit day

Hi I'm a 24 years old male. Been smoking about 10, about a pack or more, everyday for about 4 years now. It's something I had begun leaning on for every little bump or moment of exhilaration in my life. I guess i really started when some bad stuff happened in my life and i live away from my hometown with my friends. The cigarette smoking started kinda like a quiet reflection time. I would lament on things with a cigarette between my fingers, write about stuff in between smokes and even meet my friends just for a smoke over tea until it took over my life. I guess it is all the freedom of bachelor life and also the availability of cigarettes that allowed me to get hooked so easily. I always believed that i was not addicted to it until i tried to quit for the first time. There was no itch, no drying up of the throat etc etc, just a nagging thought in my head that I hadn't smoked for three days... I succumbed to that and began smoking on the 4th day - that was my 1st time trying, it was about 6 months ago. This is my 5th attempt and i am prepared. Read up on all the craving inducing elements, signed up for a couple of quitting programs that guide me through the difficult 3 minutes and I've set a goal for myself. But most of all I've accepted that this is a problem in my life and I need to fix it.

This is my cigi story and i just wanted to share it with you all. Thanks.

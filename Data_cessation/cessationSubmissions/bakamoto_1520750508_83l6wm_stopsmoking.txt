nicotine, i ain't yo bitch anymore

i didn't realize/was in denial about how much of my life is controlled by nicotine;
heck, we all know how devastating it is to the health of the body--
i can tell that it is more difficult for me to breath after i smoke
but i am not particularly enamored by life and tell myself that an early death isn't much of a fright;
i've learned how to roll my own cigarettes effectively and thusly pay only 1$-2$ a pack,
the financial incentive to quit isn't really there--i can afford to smoke; 
i am mostly alone so there isn't anyone within my immediate vicinity who is particularly bothered by the second-hand smoke 
or the smell of nicotine (that i have somehow forgotten or desperately admire, 
of course it's only the addiction that is pleased by the smell)
and i didn't realize this is vividly as i do now
but this fuckin addiction gnaws at the back of my mind,
it always gnaws
moremoremore (!!!)
i had only learned to ignore it and that is exactly what it wanted
:
when i wake up i immediately think about smoking that precious morning cigarette!
after i eat a meal, i immediately smoke, i always smoke after a meal, it relaxes me!
when i get into my car, cigarette!
when i arrive, cigarette!
when i ______, cigarette!
after i shower, cigarette!
before i go to bed, cigarette!
after i finish working on something, cigarette!
after i fail to finish working on something, cigarette!
after/before/during ANYTHING and EVERYTHING, cigarette CIGARETTE!
even while i'm smoking i'm already anticipating my next cigarette!?
nicotine, i hate you
why do i love you so fuckin much?
go to hell
ugh
bleh
im done
;;
the answer was always there:
the only way to break this vicious cycle is to simply stop smoking
no ifffs
no buttts

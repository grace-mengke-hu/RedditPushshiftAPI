My weekend scares me

Hi guys, I'm on day 3 after quitting cold turkey (25 y/o 10 year smoker about a pack a day). Things thus far have been manageable, but these three days have been spent sitting at my desk working 13-hour a day double shifts. Granted I can normally smoke whenever I want to at work, and it's encouraging that I've been able to make it this far without breaking, but I spent some of that time reading Allen Carr and the rest staring wildly into space, reading this sub, tapping my feet, pacing, making coffee and eating snacks. Really as long as I stay inside the office, near my desk, I can bash off the cravings. However, my weekend starts tomorrow and lasts through Friday. I am afraid that the excess free time outside and heightened alcohol use (I always drink on weekends) could be my downfall. What did you all do to help get through your first weekends?

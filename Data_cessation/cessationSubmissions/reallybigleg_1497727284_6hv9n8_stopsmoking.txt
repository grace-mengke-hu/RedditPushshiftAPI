2 months - weight fears

Two months today. Wish I could feel happy about that but I feel like I've been feeling ambivalent about this entire process. I won't go back to smoking because I've done it now, I've got through the worst of it, and if I went back I'd only have to quit again eventually.

But I have been feeling down and particularly this week about my weight. 

I first starting smoking when I was 15 because I had an eating disorder and had heard that smoking reduced your appetite. Although I no longer have an ED, it took me many years to recover and I still really struggle with weight changes. My mood takes a nose dive and I just feel completely worthless if my weight changes. Fortunately for me, I have not found it difficult over the last five years or so to remain at the same weight without dieting or over-exercising and finding out that I could eat until I'm full and my weight wouldn't spiral out of my control had calmed me down at a lot.

Since I quit smoking I think I have actually been eating less because, oddly enough, I have actually lost my appetite! However, I'm fairly sure I have started to gain weight. Very, very slowly so I did not notice it at first, but I feel that my weight is changing. Probably not by much, but I'm so hypervigilant of my body that I notice the change after just a few pounds.

It could be just my mood. Sometimes when I'm unhappy my body looks larger. But altogether this notion that I can eat less and still gain weight - which is a major fear of mine - has just left me feeling incredibly depressed. It's just so incredibly stressful. I guess this is something I had to face at some point, though.

Anyway. Sorry, that was quite a miserable post really, but absolutely no part of me feels like celebrating today.

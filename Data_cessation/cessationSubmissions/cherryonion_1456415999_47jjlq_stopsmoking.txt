ONE YEAR

At long last I've made it to the one year checkpoint!  

From my rough estimates, smoking a pack a day, I have gone 8760 hours without smoking, saved about 2,200 dollars, and gotten back about 304 hours of time back (If you factor 5 minutes per cigarette, and throw out half of the time because smoking while driving shouldn't count towards idle time).  That's like 12 and a half DAYS of free time that has come back to me that otherwise I would have spent sitting on my porch smoking.  I'm so happy I made this choice!  I rarely have cravings any more and I'm healthier than I've ever been!

To everyone just starting out or on the fence - KEEP GOING!  Quit smoking and start exercising instead!  You may regret that decision in the very beginning, but in the end you will be so happy you made life changes!!!

20 years old, need some motivation

I picked up smoking about a year and a half ago when my dad passed away. He was a smoker and the smell of it reminded me of him. I never smoked very much, usually 3 to 4 cigs a day, at one point getting up to half a pack a day then coming back down. I have quit for a month a couple of times (I'd still smoke on the weekends at parties) but never felt any different, so I always came back to smoking. Currently I don't smoke during the day, but when I come home around 6pm I'll smoke 3 or 4 while sipping on a glass of Jagermeister. I guess what I need is some facts about what to watch for at what point in time while quitting, such ass energy levels, general mood etc. Thanks.

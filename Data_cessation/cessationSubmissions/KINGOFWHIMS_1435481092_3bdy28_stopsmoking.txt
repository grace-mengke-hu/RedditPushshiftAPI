If the Alan Carr shit isn't working for you...

...for some people Alan Carr's way works. Fuck yes to that. I salute you.

For some of us, there is no easy way. I'm here to say, don't be discouraged because it's not "easy". Maybe you need to take another approach and treat cigs as a powerful foe. A dragon. A balrog, and you're absolutely Gandolf in this fight. Feel free to tinker with framing this bitch. As long as you don't smoke, you can play with the frames.
 
For me, the way to beat it is to admit that it is a powerful foe. The fucking devil itself. It is trying to kill me. 

Don't take this journey for granted.

 Cheers.

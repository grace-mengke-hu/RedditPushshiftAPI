I'm ready to be a quitter!

Hi there! I hope this post is allowed.

I found this sub months ago and wasn't ready to commit so I never joined. Just subscribed and wanted to say hello and implore you all for some good luck and good vibes!

A bit of background: I've been smoking since I was 18, I'm 29 now. I managed to quit full stop in August 2017 because I was pregnant. I had my beautiful baby in March 2018 and after a lot of stress, family drama, a big move, and hundreds of other excuses, I started smoking again in September 2018. My husband is also a smoker but has decided to switch to vaping, which he really enjoys. So I have tried several vaping methods and just absolutely hate them. I'm ready to just be done with nicotine.

I'm about to download Smoke Free and would appreciate any words of wisdom that you all may care to impart upon me!

Please wish me luck!!!

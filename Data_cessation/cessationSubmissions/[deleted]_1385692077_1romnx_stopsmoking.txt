Since I subscribed, I've found this community to be very supportive but I'd appreciate if somebody ACTUALLY answered this question I have for once.

I recently stopped smoking (November 4th) and of course NOW I get strange symptoms. I had a strange pain in my chest for the first week but it went away. I was told that was normal and it was because my lungs are getting more oxygen than they were used to for the first time since I started that's nasty habit. More or less my muscles were just stretching. Now I have a strange sensation ***only*** in the left side of my chest. Like someone is just under the skin and slightly pushing out for a split second. Having depression and anxiety, and a mother who is a severe hypochondriac, of course I tell myself "fuck it's cancer or a heart disease". A couple of nights I worried myself to the point where I was in my pajamas at 4am flipping through Google, Reddit, and yahoo answers looking to see if anyone else had this problem to no avail. I'd really like an answer to this. I'm 19 and was a moderate smoker for 3 years.

Changing my environment would make it easier?

Hi Reddit. I'm a 15-or-so-per-day smoker, and it's been quite a while I've been willing to quit. I never find the opportunity.

In fact, I always tell myself that I need to change my environment to succeed in that: I have a roommate who smokes, I have plenty of smoker friends, I have that one habit whenever I go to school or to work to smoke those same cigarettes, on a way-too-regular basis.
So whenever I think of quitting, I just tell myself "nah, better wait for a change in my life".

That would happen in September or so: I will move somewhere else, I won't see my current friends that often, and I think I'll try to avoid having a roommate. The habits won't be the same, and I think it's the good moment to operate the move.

Changing brutally my habits right now seems too harsh to me.
What do you think about it?

Quitting this bad habit.

So I am smoking my last cig and putting a patch on and hope I can do this. I quit the two times I was pregnant with my kids and then because my husband smoked, it was easy to start again. Now I am around no one that smokes, so hope this helps. It is Oct 18th where I am. So with luck and will power I can do this. I have also started walking to try to lose weight, I know some gain it when you quit and I don't want to do that. I have stop caffeine also, so we will see.

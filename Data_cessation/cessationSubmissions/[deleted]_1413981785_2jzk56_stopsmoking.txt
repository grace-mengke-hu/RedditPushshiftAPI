Anyone else have trouble with cold / allergy-like symptoms?

So I've been quit for 22 days as of last night. Everything is going great, cravings have subsided, breathing better, smelling things again, etc. etc. etc. 

The only problem is that I have MAJOR allergy issues when I'm not smoking. This is a problem I've experienced in the past and honestly has been the cause of relapse a few times. My nose is running all the time and my eyes are constantly watering. I am carrying around kleenex everywhere I go and people at my work are asking if I've got the flu since this has been going on over two weeks. 

Anyone else experience this, and does it stop?

Two Weeks and a Very Hard Day

Yesterday I had the biggest stress-trigger of my two week quit. Basically, I had an hour where I literally could only think about smoking but the two days before that day (it was a planned thing) I visualized myself getting through that hour without smoking. I visualized it over and over again and, of course, thought of having to reset my badge on here! Haha, I'm happy to say it worked and I did not smoke! And now I've made it to two weeks! It feels great to know I can really say no even when I'm up against something that feels insurmountable.

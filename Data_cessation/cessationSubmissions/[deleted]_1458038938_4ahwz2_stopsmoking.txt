Quitters Flu

I have been loving the big lungfuls of fresh air I can take since quitting smoking. But I'm now full of cold, tight chest, sore sinuses and throat, headaches etc etc. What amazes me is that I used to smoke through this crap! Now that I've had a taste of life without smoking I can't believe it - even if you were to light one up in front of me now I wouldn't take it. I am taking heart that his is my body flushing out all those nasty toxins and gunk and sticking to my plan. 
Now I'm off to do my next 5k walk, get some fresh air and sunshine and enjoy the fact that however crappy I feel, I would feel a whole lot worse if I was still smoking. Man, I LOVE the feeling that I'm showing this addiction who's boss ðŸ˜ƒ

It's the little things.

I made it 6 days without buying my own pack of smokes. I had an anxiety attack last night which led me to buying another pack, but I only smoked one before calming down significantly. I gave away the rest. :)

I'm still chewing nicotine gum, but I'm hoping to phase that out in a few weeks here too. I don't need a crutch like that for my life. I can sing better now than I've been able to in *years*, and that's what's keeping me going.

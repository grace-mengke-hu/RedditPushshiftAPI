A close call and a thought

I quit on New Year's this year and decided this time I was 100% dedicated to quitting. This time feels different.

Yesterday my cat had a sudden heart attack and died. I was a mess. My first instinct was throw on clothes and run downstairs to the shop to buy cigarettes before even taking his body to the vet. There's no way I'm getting through this without one.

Long story short... I stopped and realized that a cigarette wouldn't change anything in a positive way. In fact it would just make all of this even harder. 

So now I am +1 more day smoke free and I feel so much better about my choice. I'm a bit sad that my first instinct was "CIGARETTE! NOW!" but I'm happy that I was able to stop myself in one of the toughest situations I've gone through in a very long time.

To all my fellow New Year's quitters...keep being strong. ♥️

New here

Hi, all!

I've been lurking for awhile, but wanted to finally introduce myself. Reading all the posts has helped me stay strong. You all are wonderful people. 

I'll be six weeks smoke-free tomorrow, and couldn't be happier about it. I got kind of lucky with the timing, honestly, as I happened to quit smoking several days before I caught a nasty virus from my husband and ended up with bronchitis. There's no surer way to quit smoking than to get bronchitis!  I was sick as a dog for a couple weeks, which (I'm assuming) helped me get through the worst of the cravings. Also, struggling to breathe with bronchitis made me realize that I really, really, really don't want lung cancer. Yikes. 

In any case, I've made it almost six weeks! It's taken some getting used to, figuring out what to do with the time I used to spend smoking (playing Destiny on Xbox has been my strategy thus far), and I've been mostly avoiding my big situational cues until recently. Talking on the phone was always a big cue for me, but this past week I've made several long phone calls, and was stoked to see that it wasn't a problem. I've also been to our favorite bar twice, and to a karaoke box three times, and haven't caved. Woot! That's a big deal, and I'm celebrating it!

I'm fortunate that none of my friends smoke anymore, and my husband and a good friend here have both quit, so they've been really supportive and encouraging. 

Long story short: Hi! Six weeks tomorrow! Glad to be here!

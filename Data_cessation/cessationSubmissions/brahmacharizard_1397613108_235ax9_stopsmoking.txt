PAWS from nicotine?

Is there such a thing (Post Acute Withdrawal Syndrome?)

The last 4-5 days I've been really buzzy and have prettt much no tolerance for anybody. I caved at the 3 week mark last time due to these ridiculously strong cravings. It's not so much that I want a cigarette; more that I just want this horrible feeling to go away. Last time I didn't do anything about it and bought a pack after work. This time I'm getting it out there in the hope that communicating and reaching out will help me through this day.

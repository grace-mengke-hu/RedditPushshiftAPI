6 months quit, having cravings.

I quit smoking cigarettes about a year ago (don't remember the actual date, could be more) as I weaned myself onto a vape. I had been using the vape for about a year and a half (overlapping vape and cigs for some time) and then lost it in March of this year. 

I figured the loss of the vape pen indicated a good time to stop altogether, and I've been successful so far!

A few weeks ago I went to a music festival and bummed 1-2 cigarattes each day. Since then, I have had immense cravings every time I drink. So bad that I have seriously considered walking across the street to the gas station and buying a pack, but I haven't done it. 

I just gotta hold strong. Cold weather is coming and something about the fall and winter weather always sparks the addiction for me. Maybe it has to do with the start of the school year? Or just that it's so nice to smoke on a cold, overcast day.

Anyway, I'm NOT going to buy a pack. I just can't. Not gonna happen. Nope.

I plan on quitting tomorrow and need help/ideas?

I am based in Europe and started smoking again two years ago after two years of being a non-smoker (hypnosis). I’ve tried numerous things in the last two years (hypnosis/acupuncture etc) but with no success. I’m flying to the States tomorrow to spend 3 months travelling around and have decided it’s the perfect opportunity to stop! New environment etc. what are some tips/apps/advice/reading material I can use to help me with this???? Please help. I feel completely incapable of doing this but know I can!!!

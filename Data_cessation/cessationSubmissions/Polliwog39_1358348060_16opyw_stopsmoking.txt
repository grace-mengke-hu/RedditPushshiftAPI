Today is the day! I can do this. 

I have been a smoker since I was 17 and I'm now 29... almost half my life has revolved around smoking. I have quit a couple times...and lasted a few months....but always relapsed. I wonderful Redditor provided me with a copy of Allen Carr's book...and wow. Exactly what I needed. I always made excuses why not to quit. But not anymore. My husband quite about a month ago... and I'm doing him a disservice by continuing to smoke. But what really got me...my 4 yr old daughter.... she said " Daddy quit...now it is your turn." I owe it to her and myself. 

 I got this...I can do it. And I just want to say what and awesome positive community this is. I really look forward to my smoke free days ahead.

LET'S GO! 23 years old, been smoking for 4 years. Tried to quit dozens of times, since only a few of my friends are smokers too. Never succeeded, the longest I've been without is like 2-3 weeks. Now it's time to quit, I won't gonna die because of this. I'm *capable*, I'm *deserving*, I'm *worthy*!!!

I'm not feeling it?

I've stopped smoking a few days ago (see flair), cutting back from 14 cigarettes a day (more when I'm drinking). I went in cold turkey and kinda impulsive, just trying to see how long I would last and trying to discover what stopping would do with me.

So far, I'm not having any trouble. I'm sweating a bit more in the evening/at night and after everything I do my mind goes: "Time for a smo... wait, you've stopped". It's a slightly empty feeling. That's basically all I'm feeling right now. Even during my beer-drinking-evening it wasn't much more than 'I would really like a smoke right now'. 

Should I prepare for some sort of crash soon or am I just lucky? I'm not writing this to be a big boy or something, it's just that it's kinda confusing me since I was prepared to feel like utter crap for two+ weeks.

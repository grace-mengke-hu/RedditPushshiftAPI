Made it over 100 days!!!!

This is my second quit.  On the first, I made it 84 days when I was at a party drinking and thought, "84 days without a smoke,  I've beat this sh*t!  I can smoke one no problem, just for fun"  Well, that one turned into 5 that night, then I bought a pack to smoke 4 out of and throw away the rest.  I did that twice a week until I decided I might as well just smoke the whole pack.  Next thing  I know, I was smoking more than I was before I quit!

Not this time, I know "just one" turns into two, then three, then a 1/4 and pack, then I'm a full blown smoker again!

Anyway, I just wanted to acknowledge to myself (and others) that I (and everyone else) am completely capable of doing this.  I've made it over 100 days, and I rarely even think about those pesky sticks anymore.

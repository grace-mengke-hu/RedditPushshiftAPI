Going to be the achievement of my life ...

Hey reddit. I've tried to quit smoking for some time now. I'm 19 years old. I've been addicted to other things, but i've managed to battle them. This is the next step for me. I heard cigs are as addictive as opiates, cause of the nicotine. I've tried so many times... to the point of deciding that, if I do this, I will be happy for the rest of my life. I'm tired of feeling out of breath and wasting money, of feeling like a loser when I light up. I hope this new perspective will help me quit for good. Achievement of my life. If I die, at least I died free from the things I hated about myself the most. My vices that kept me trapped. Hope I make it.

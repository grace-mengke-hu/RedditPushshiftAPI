5 months in and finally comfortable with the idea of NEVER smoking again

Up to this point I've had to focus more on the day-to-day aspect and thinking that I would never have another cigarette seemed too definite and overwhelming. I am now far enough removed from the habit that I genuinely do not want to even have "just one" anymore, which is a freaking awesome feeling! 
Just wanted to drop in with a quick word of encouragement for all of you who are in the early stages and say that it does get better... but ONLY if you don't smoke! Keep up the great work everyone!

It feels so easy for a few days and then I just can't stop thinking about smoking

I reached 5 days. I always reach a decent mark in the past few tries.. A few months ago I went a month.. before that time I probably 10 days. This morning I just couldn't stop thinking about smoking. I bought a 10g tobacco pouch and smoked 1 and then got home and instantly threw it away. Then I went out again after lunch and bought another and now I want to throw it away again after just smoking one. I hate resetting the nicotine addiction, I just need to get to a point where I stop thinking about it again.

After smoking I don't feel good at all, I just feel agitated and I know I will but that damn addiction just makes me let my guard down. 

The mind can be so cunning to make me smoke. I've already not smoke 20 or so cigarettes so I'm not losing hope.. I just need to pick up where I left off.. Write down the reasons I need to quit on my phone and keep browsing this sub and reading Alan Carr.

I feel I can't better myself in other areas if I'm being so counter-intuitive by smoking. I can fucking do this!

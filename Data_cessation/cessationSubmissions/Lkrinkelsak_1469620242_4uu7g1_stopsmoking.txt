on the fence about quitting.

So in about 9 hours I'll be headed to work and beginning day one of my quit attempt.  But it seems like my mind is constantly trying to rationalize pushing my quit date back another week.  This happened last week and here I am again.  Anybody have the same thing happen to them? I'm determined to quit, I'm 29 and I've already had a PE and just can't do this anymore.

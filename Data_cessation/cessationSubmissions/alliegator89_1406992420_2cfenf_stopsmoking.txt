Feeling stressed and stuck

I do okay with cravings until I try to study.  The stress comes rushing in.   A fog rolls into my mind.  I physically feel my facial muscles tighten.  I can't focus on my studies.  It takes all of my mental energy to keep the craving at bay.  I can sometimes squeeze out five minutes of studying but I inevitably end up distracted or feel the immediately need to get up from my desk.  

I don't have time to deal with this, but I also don't have time to slip up and start the quitting process all over again.  I feel very stuck and very stressed.

Almost at 72 hours smoke free, feel great!

Been a smoker for 8 years or so (im 26) the past 5 ive been smokin 15-20 a day consistently. I have quit multiple times in the past for 2 weeks, 3 weeks, even 3 months once. Quit attempts have ranged from almost no noticeable side-effects to crippling restless leg crying depression. I read Carr's book this time, and although I usually dont buy into self help BS, that dude really struck a cord. The first day I only got one or two really bad cravings and that first night I did not sleep well at all, but things have been good the past two days. I think about cigarettes often but no real "cravings" recently. I am already noticing heightened sense of smell. I havent had any " smoking nightmares" yet, but I have gotten them in previous times so I wont be shocked if they happen.

Like I said, I dont usually buy into that self-help stuff, but Carr's words have kept me very positive and I'm handling the "withdrawal" well. I honestly feel guilty calling it a withdrawal because it seems so easy right now. I hope I can keep coasting like this for the next few weeks! You guys can do it too, dont let the brainwashing get to you!

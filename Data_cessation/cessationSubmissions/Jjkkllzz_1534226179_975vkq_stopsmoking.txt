So I’ve been 2.5 months smoke free and I just got in my car to go buy cigarettes.

I’ve been not well emotionally tonight and sadness and anxiety were starting to take over. It’s funny how after all this time (which isn’t long but should be long enough) my brain can still convince me that cigarettes will make everything better. So, it’s almost 1 am and I had to drive 20 min out to find an open store. When I was almost there I turned around to go home without the cigarettes. I guess the drive was enough to calm me down. Anyway, there’s not really a point to this post but to remind myself and anybody else that cigarettes don’t make anything at all better. Not one puff ever.

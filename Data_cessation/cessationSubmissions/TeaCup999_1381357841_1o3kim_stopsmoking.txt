First day quitting after around 10 years of more than a pack a day.

So i've always played with the thought of quitting during my days as a smoker but i never really made a serious attempt. Today i did. I haven't smoked until i woke up, well i've smoked marihuana but i don't know if that counts since it's not really tobacco. Anyway, i'm in my bed now at 00:30 (CET, Amsterdam) and holy shit.. can't sleep, want to smoke pretty badly... maybe have a tea or something... i'm lucky that i'm unemployed at the moment because that way i can take all the time and rest i want but. fuck. is there anything people do when they want to smoke? I've heard people about lollypops and such and thats not for me. Also those nicotine stickers are not going to cut it for me... im also thinking about walking around for a block or two... seriously dont know... any help is welcome! cheers!

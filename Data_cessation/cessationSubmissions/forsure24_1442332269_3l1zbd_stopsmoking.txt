Sick but not smoking :)

I just hit 22 days of not smoking and I woke up feeling awful. My throat is sore and I'm coughing a lot. I realized it's the first time I've had a cough or sore throat from not smoking. It used to be so common after a long Saturday night, and now I only get sore throats from viruses! Yippee.

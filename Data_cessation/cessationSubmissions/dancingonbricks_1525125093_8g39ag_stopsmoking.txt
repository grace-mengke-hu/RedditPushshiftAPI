I should be stopping but I don't really want to

Perhaps a bit different than most posts, but here we go.

I am currently on vacation with my parents, who don't know I smoke (live on my own, am 22 yo). Therefore, I don't smoke on vacation. It's been three and a half days so far and it's going well. I'm not even that grumpy.

That said, I am in complete different surroundings than I normally am. I can't smoke, but I still want to. When I get home I want to light one up. I like smoking, and all my friends smoke too. My boyfriend doesn't, and I barely smoke with him around, but there's always cigarettes to look forward to.

Buuuuut I know I should stop. I know I should use this opportunity to quit for good. And I want to want to stop, but I just don't. What do I do?

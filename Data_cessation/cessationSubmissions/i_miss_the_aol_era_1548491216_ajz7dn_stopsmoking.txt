Tonsil stones, anyone else?

I know stinking like cigarettes is way worse than bad breath but good god I hate this. 

Before I started smoking freshman year of high school, I remember getting them. As a smoker, I didn't. I didn't even realize this til I quit. I quit when I was pregnant and started when my kid was about 1. I quit for four months in 2017. I've quit for days and weeks, so far this round I'm about five days in. I do better when I don't make a big deal or pay attention to my progress. Anyway. 

I also get weird marks on my teeth, but I know that gets less frequent after a while. 

I really hate the tonsil stones, so damn much. It's definitely deterred by smoking since it starts immediately after I quit and doesn't lessen any for almost two years afterwards and having been a problem before i even started smoking. 

Just sucks.

6 month celebration/Summer 2014 cohort check-in thread

As of today, it has been 6 months since my final cigarette. I decided to wait a day before buying another pack and things sort of went from there. I would say my desire to smoke is pretty damn close to someone who never smoked to begin with. 

For those of you who quit over the summer, how is it going? What were some of your biggest challenges or victories?

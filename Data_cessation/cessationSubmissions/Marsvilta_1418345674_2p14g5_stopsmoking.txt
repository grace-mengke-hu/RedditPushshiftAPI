Today is day 7.

Went from 20+ cigs a day to nothing. The first 2 days I got angry at the drop of a hat, my whole body hurt and all I could think about was how just a couple puffs would alleviate the immediate pain. The worst part was not being able to sleep. I stayed up for 72 hours straight because I just wouldn't get tired enough and if I laid on my bed my mind would just race thinking about cigs. Day 3 I felt sick pretty much purely out of exhaustion. Finally slept that 3rd night and had an EXTREMELY vivid dream that I was jogging around my town running errands. When I woke up at 5:30 (only slept for about 5 hours) I felt compelled to go out for a jog. I ran a mile around the lake in my backyard and as soon as I got home and out of the shower I FELT GREAT! I made a nice eggs benedict breakfast to reward myself and played cs:go most of the day but I just felt sooooo proud of the progress I was making physically and mentally. 

Since then I have had ZERO cravings and my roommate even relapsed and bought a pack (he tried to quit with me) and I saw it sitting on the kitchen counter while I was cooking but I had ZERO desire to bum one. 

I'm back on a normal sleep schedule, midnight to 6am. I've been cooking up a storm, even making breakfast which I never used to eat before lunch at around 2-3pm. 

My 'wake up call' was the fact that if I ran out of smokes and a craving hit I would be so desperate that instead of running to the store I would take a piece of computer paper and roll up a smoke in that... disgusting as FUCK... 

I started smoking 9 years ago when I was 17 and I hope this new trend will last me a lifetime. I haven't told my family yet, I'll just let them find out the next time we get together for a gathering and I'm not excusing myself every hour to light up.

2,000 cigarettes

That's how many cigarettes
I
HAVENT
SMOKED
since quitting. 2,000....... I guess when you smoke 20 at a time it's something that never really crosses your mind. 
10 cartons......$1,200 
It's only been two months. I'd be a liar and fake if I said I didn't have some remorse when thinking about everything I threw away in the past 20 years of smoking. All that money, time, youth......

Two months, 2,000 cigs NOT smoked, 400 hours of life regained, 166 hours NOT spent standing around smoking...... These numbers are becoming staggering...... And I am a happy man!

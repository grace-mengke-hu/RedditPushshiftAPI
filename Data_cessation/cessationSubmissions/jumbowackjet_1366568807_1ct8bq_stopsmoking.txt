6 months

Hey guys!

6 months ago I finished reading "the easy way" by Allen Carr. 6 months ago I stopped smoking. Haven't touched a sig. Today I ran 10 miles in 1 hour 27 min. The first few days are hell, I know I've been there. But it gets better! You can do it guys, go for it! You're stronger than the nicotine.

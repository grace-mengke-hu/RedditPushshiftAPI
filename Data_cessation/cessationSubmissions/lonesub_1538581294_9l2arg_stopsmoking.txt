Hi Im New Preparing to quit !

What should I do to prepare myself to quit smoking . I smoke a lot been a smoker for about 3-4 years now . Normally I do away with with one to two pack . I have this tendency to keep on smoking I won't stop at 1-2 my friends have been saying it for some time I just don't know when to stop cause I keep on buying them till and smoking till I sleep and first thing morning I always am going out to buy a new pack . It's a rather big dent in my pocket actually . I wanna quit it for sure this time .

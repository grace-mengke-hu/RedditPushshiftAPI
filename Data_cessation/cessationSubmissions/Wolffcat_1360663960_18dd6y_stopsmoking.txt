Not finding it too hard!

I have only just stumbled across this sub, 5 days after my last cigarette! I thought I would just let the Internet know how it's going etc.

I decided to quit a week ago and ordered an e cigarette, I didn't make a big deal out of quitting, which I think has helped. When the e cigarette arrived I put my cancer sticks in a draw and started on the e cig, no last one before I quit and all that crap. It helps. A LOT.

I have tried to quit a few times before and really found it hard, nearly killed a few people during the process. I haven't really craved a proper cigarette since quitting this time which amazes me, I actually feel like I could do it this time which makes it easier still.

Anyway, just thought I would share that with the wires...

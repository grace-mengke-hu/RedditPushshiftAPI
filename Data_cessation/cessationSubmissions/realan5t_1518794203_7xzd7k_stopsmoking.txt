How long will I miss it?

I smoked 1-1.5 packs a day for almost 20 years.  I’m almost 9 months smoke free.  I always knew I would quit because I didn’t want to be a smoker.  I was embarrassed by it and it honestly made me feel trashy, however, I enjoyed smoking.  I really liked it.

What made me finally quit?  My husband (who quit smoking 7months before I did) told our daughter the dangers of smoking when she asked why he quit.  She then begged me not to smoke because she didn’t want me to die or get sick.  She even put a “do not enter mommy” sign on the garage door because that’s where I would go many times a day for a smoke.  I couldn’t look her in her tear filled eyes and continue smoking and not feel like the worlds worse mom...so I had my last cigarette June 1,2017.  I did it cold turkey, no patch, no pills, no e cigs.  It was very sad for me knowing that was my last one ever, I almost felt like I was in mourning.

I still miss it and think about it, especially when I have a glass of wine.  Will I ever stop missing it or is that just the fate of a previous smoker...missing it forever?

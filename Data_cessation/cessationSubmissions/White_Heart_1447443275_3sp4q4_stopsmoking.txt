It's been three weeks and over 500 hours... Where's my "energy boost"?! I want my energy boost!

Yeah, I'm just clowning obviously! I've had my energy boost about two weeks in, and today while doing our daily walk I left my dog (a young, muscular pup) in the dust with my explosive sprint, even though I had just gone through a 9 hours workday.

I couldn't run 50 meters before. I'm 27.

This is amazing!

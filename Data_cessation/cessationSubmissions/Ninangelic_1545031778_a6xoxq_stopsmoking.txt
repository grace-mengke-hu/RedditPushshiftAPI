Right now is the perfect day to quit

Not on the first, on the start of a week, the start of a month, some special date or special moment. Right now is the perfect day (and yeah I know it’s the start of a week haha). I’ve already tried all the “perfect moments”.

Been a smoker since I was around 16 and I’m now 31. Every day I think about quitting. I feel guilty every time I waste money on this stupid habit.

I feel so stuck in life at the moment needing a huge change. Quitting would be a huge change. And if I quit smoking other things in my life will change to, like more money, better health and so on. 

Gonna give it another try today and this time I will make it last. I’m gonna look at myself as a non smoker, not an ex smoker. I’m not gonna let my brain trick me into the habit again. I’m gonna do everything I can because this shit isn’t worth all the guilt and anxiety it gives me. If other people can do it then so can I. I wanna be healthy and happy 😊

Sorry for rambling. Just wanted to post my pep talk to myself here and maybe get a little support 😊

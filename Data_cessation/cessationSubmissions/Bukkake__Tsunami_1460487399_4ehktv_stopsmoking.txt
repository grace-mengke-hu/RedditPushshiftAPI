I had a dream

After 4 pulls on a cigarette I realized what I had done. And it felt terrible. "God damn man, you just ruined your 100+ days and have to start over. What the fuck, that wasn't worth it at all", I thought.

Then I woke up.

It's weird, this was the first dream of smoking I've had since I quit. The drinking dreams were much more frequent when I quit that.

I'm pretty sure this is my mind testing certain scenarios in a safe environment - what would happen if...?

I like my subconscious response. It means I'm in the right mindset. Until yesterday I was sure I was on the right track with this quitting attempt, but I also knew that I wasn't completely over the hill yet. Now I know I'm on the right track. This is it. I got this.

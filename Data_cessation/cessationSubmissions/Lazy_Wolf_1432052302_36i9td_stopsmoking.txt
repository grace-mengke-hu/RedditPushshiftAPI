I could use some help

I've been trying to quit smoking on my own for months. I thought i had the strength of will to quit cold turkey, and i have quit for over a month long stretch once. I really want to stop, but eventually i keep coming back to it. It's the one addiction i can't resist whenever i have a really stressful day or i drink a little too much. This is always followed by me "quitting" for real this time and throwing away my lighter. Even right now all i want to do is go to a near by gas station and maybe just grab one black and mild. I haven't actually bought a pack in 2 months, but i've still smoked at least twice a week. I've started exercising and have tried to stay as busy as possible to keep it off my mind, but I think it's time for me to admit that i could use some advice. My dad used to smoke as well, but his advice is to find God. How do i quit smoking for good?

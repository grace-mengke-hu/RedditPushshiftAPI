The worst part is the head pressure.

I quit smoking and switched to vaping for a couple yars and got more addicted. I stopped for three days a week ago then the head pressure and confusion got so bad that I relapsed on a disposable e cig to get through work. Now im starting over after a week and just 5 hours in the head pressure is full force.

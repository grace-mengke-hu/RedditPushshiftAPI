24 Hours after deciding to stop.

So, this is my first post. 
I am 19 years old, started smoking probably around the age of 15.
Startes out as having a few smokes when drinking beers with my friends. Then a year later I got hooked, now I'll join the military in less than a month. I am glad that I havent smoked too much ( max. 5 cigarettes a day ) in the previous few months.
But around 24 hours in and I feel better than expected.

Of course there is this craving, but I can do it!
Any tips for stopping, Im sure there are more than enough post out there for tips, but hey, why not ask anyways :P

Feeling after you stop smoking

Hi guys, so I quit cold turkey on Monday, after I had a slight panic attack the night before because I started fearing the health consequences of smoking. In general, I feel that my breath is better, but I feel some sort of heaviness feeling, and I'm much more aware of my breathing. It could be the anxiety, which it probably is. I went to a doctor to check it out, and he said that my lungs are clear, and that I should not worry about it.

I was reading a bit about what effects people have when they stop smoking - and some of what I read is somewhat what I am feeling. Was just wondering what your experiences were when you stopped smoking. Do you at any point feel that you need to take some deeper breaths than normal for example?  I notice that when I'm distracted I don't feel a thing and I'm fine, the moment I realise I feel like my breathing is off. This is my third day of not smoking, and I want to keep this up.

Would appreciate some experiences :)

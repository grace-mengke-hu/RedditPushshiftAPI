A little magic

Had a mate who smokes drop by today. Told him I'd quit but he was welcome to smoke. He did and each time he lit a cigarette I could see him watching me, waiting for me to ask for one. But I didn't (honestly I wasn't even tempted) and he ended up asking him how I the fuck I was doing it. I smiled and told him it was magic. 
Don't tell anyone but all my smoking mates are getting a copy of Allen Carr's Easyway for Christmas because this is a magic trick I'm happy to share.

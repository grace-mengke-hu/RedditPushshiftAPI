Iâ€™m a girl who feel herself so nervy bc of this quitting thing..

So, Iâ€™m 19 yrs old(almost 20)and Iâ€™m smoking since I turned to 13 yrs. Thatâ€™s 6 long year(almost 7)once i quitted for 6month, now I need/want to quit but this is so hard. Iâ€™m clean almost 3days, I know this isnâ€™t a big deal but to me this is it. Iâ€™m always craving, and I really want a cigarette. Iâ€™m scared bc of the next day when I need to going to work. What will I do in my breaks? What will I do if I feel myself uncomfortable? Why is this so hard? Will this being worse? How others survive this situation? Agrh..ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜ Sorry for my english, this isnâ€™t my birth language.)

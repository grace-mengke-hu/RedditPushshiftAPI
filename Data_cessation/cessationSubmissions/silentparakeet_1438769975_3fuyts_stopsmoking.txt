Day 3

I've gone back and forth on quitting for some time, I've even successfully quit for a few months in the past. This is it, this is the time I do it for real! There's a difference this time, my cough in the morning is awful and gets to be painful. There is also this awful taste in my mouth. Is this happening to anyone else?

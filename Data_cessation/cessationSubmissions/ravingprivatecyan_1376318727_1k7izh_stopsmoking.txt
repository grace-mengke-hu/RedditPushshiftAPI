Made it one year, never looking back.

Today marked my 365th day without the beast in my life. My health has improved so much, I stopped being lazy and started running and working out. Goodbye shortness of breath, hello abs. My girlfriend who had been smoking for many years has also quit since March with great success. My teeth are not disgusting and I don't smell like shit. I don't feel like shit. I always feel good. 

Looking back one of the most interesting observations I've made is how much I thought smoking helped relieve the anxiety I suffer. It's pretty much disappeared now.

Anyone thinking of quitting do it now. Nicotines a bitch. Are you?

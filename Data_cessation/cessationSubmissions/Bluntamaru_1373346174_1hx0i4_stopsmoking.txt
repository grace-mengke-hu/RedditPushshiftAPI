Need some advice on dealing with not smoking while imbibing Alcohol

I'm sure I'm not the only one that has this problem.  I've been lurking around for a bit and I've gotten myself way off of the amount that I used to smoke.  In a typical day I used to smoke around 1.5 packs a day, now I'm down to 2 tops with days I don't smoke any.  Now,  On the normal alcohol free days the only time I smoke is usually when I hang out with my buddies that still smoke, if I don't see them I don't smoke. Then there are the days that I drink(few and far between, weddings and holidays) and I can end up smoking a pack on those nights.  I've thought about never showing up to these events but I don't wanna be rude. I've also thought about not drinking at the events, but since these are people that I haven't seen in some time or rarely seen I generally end up drinking as a social lubricant.  Anyone got some advice?

What can I do to help my partner stop smoking?

(We’re both 19)
He currently smokes 10 rollups a day, I don’t know what I can do to help him stop, the “it gives you cancer” thing isn’t big enough an incentive apparently. He bought a vape not long ago with a low nicotine content but it runs out too quick and buying 30g of tobacco is more convenient and cheaper than buying refills for the vape.

It’s starting to affect me, I know we’re going to spend the rest of our lives together and thinking about him getting cancer by 50 gives me anxiety, I don’t like tasting the tobacco every time I kiss him, I don’t like the smell he exudes of tobacco either. I’m trying not to make this about me, it’s about us. He wants to quit too but he’s not trying hard enough, he ends up smoking more and more. 

I don’t know how I can help him stop. I haven’t ever been to this sub before so sorry if theres rules I’m breaking. I just don’t know what to do.

I think about this when my brain tells me that i really should smoke right now.

Stop and close your eyes  for one minute.

Think about how you light up the cigarette and breath in the ugly tar and 4000 other chemical substances. 

You breath in really deep. 

**As deep as you can.**

You feel the hot mist, rushing through your lungs and feeling your blood cells absorbing the oxygen with the dirty smoke. Every µm² of your lung and mouth is filled with it. 
You breath out and enjoy watching the blue haze rising to the air. “Wow, that was good” , you think. The coughing with the slimy snot comes as a special reward for smoking. 
No regrets, you still feel good.
Now you are satisfied. All you needed was one deep gasp of chemical haze. 

You already supplied your want but nonetheless you smoke. I mean you *have* to finish the cigarette until it’s burnt-out. It would be a **waste of money to not smoke the rest**.

You suck the filter until it gets brown. Like something you never want to touch with your mouth.

Now you are relaxed, your problems are gone now and you feel happier.

Am I right? 

**No, nothing changed. Absolutely nothing.**

You felt good for 5 seconds because your brain told you that you really had to smoke and you did. But after that there is a black void and you think about it: “Why the fuck did I do this?” and you’re still a person which is not satisfied. Your health will go downhill and you will have a miserable life thinking about smoking every 10 minutes.

You will smoke your entire life and always have the feeling that something is missing. You will smoke and determine after every cigarette that it aren’t the cigarettes. 
But you are addicted and you will continue to smoke **until you are ill and have a shitty painful death**

This is what I think about everytime and it helps me

**Tl;dr: You smoke to become happy. But you never will become happy person and die a shitty death**

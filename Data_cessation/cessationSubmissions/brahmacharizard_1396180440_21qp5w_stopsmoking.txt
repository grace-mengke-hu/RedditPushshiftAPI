Today marks a week, checking in for the sake of accountability

Wow, such quitting! This is the first time I've posted here, after many attempts. My participation in /r/stopdrinking was instrumental in helping me get past the initial stage of sobriety I was stuck in. For some reason I haven't treated previous quit attempts with the same level of commitment... Just because alcoholism is so destructive and cigarettes seem so benign, at least in terms of immediate impact, why should I not treat the two with the same level of respect? I have confidence that realisation will carry over in the coming days, weeks, months, years...

Here's to another day then! If I may ask, what's the best tool you've got in your quit kit?

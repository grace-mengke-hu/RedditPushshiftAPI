Quit drinking 60 days ago, bring on the smoking!!

Since I quit drinking (I'm a pretty serious alcoholic) my smoking has gone through the roof. Which is fine, alcohol was killing me even quicker than smoking. But I want to be truly healthy, and lose the "identity crutch" of smoking. So here we go, bring the pain. And yes, I'm reading Carrs book. :-)

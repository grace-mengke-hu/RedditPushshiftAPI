I would have had two already this morning.

I smoked my last one on Saturday after about 10 years of smoking non-stop (a whole decade!).  I have been checking in on this sub and I'm so happy the everyone is so supportive and has put things into a different perspective.

Today is the first work day being a non-smoker.  Usually I would be looking at the clock every ten minutes and decide whether or not it had been long enough from my last cig.  I would have had two already and I'm only about 3 hours into my current workday.

I'm trying to keep the mind set that I am now a NON-SMOKER and no longer need to check the clock constantly.  My previous dependence on counting the clock now makes me realize how desperate I was until that next fix. 

I can do this. I will do this.

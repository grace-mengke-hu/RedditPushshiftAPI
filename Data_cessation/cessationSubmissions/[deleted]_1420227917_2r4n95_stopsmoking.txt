Winter is the best time to quit smoking, smokers smell so bad in the cold.

I have quite for about 4 years, just wanted to draw your attention to how much worse cig smoke smells on smokers coming in from the cold. Its really disgusting, can't believe i smelled like that for so long. Keep up the good work.

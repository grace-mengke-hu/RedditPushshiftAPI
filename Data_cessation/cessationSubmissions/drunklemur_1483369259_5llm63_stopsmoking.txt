Just bought 2 beers instead of a pack of smokes

It's been two months and the culmination of coming down from NYE celebrating and reconnecting with an ex has got me all twisted up, chest was tight as shit and haven't felt such a strong craving in a month. I just hi got two beers instead, fuck it, whatever works right.

I seem to be getting angry and cranky for the past few days. Anyone else feel this way?

I'm not a rager. Well I have my anger issues but I usually had a pretty good handle on it and kinda had it bottled up. But now, 3 weeks after quitting, whenever I play any video games I tend to rage a lot and take out my frustration in chat. And now it makes me feel like a shitty person. Any one else have any emotional side effects?

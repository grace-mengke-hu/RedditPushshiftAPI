Two birds with one stone...

Hi there,

I've been addicted to smoking since I was about 15-16... I'm 19 now and am going to quit today, before matters get worse. 

As my title suggests, I am also fighting a PMO addiction; my second addiction. As of today I am officially 1 week in (/r/NoFap). I have very clear and stern intentions of changing my entire self into the best ME that I can, as I see plenty of potential but too many distractions and "cheats" that are hindering who I could be tomorrow. I'm glad to join you all, most of you probably have stronger addictions than I in terms of how many years, but I am here to join you to kick the butt!

Cheers.

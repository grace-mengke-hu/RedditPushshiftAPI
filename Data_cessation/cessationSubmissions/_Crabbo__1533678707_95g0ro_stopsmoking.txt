13 days and I am not very persuasive after all

Hey! 

I usually mark down my Quit Date in my agenda, but I had been vaping for a while (heavily) and that felt like I had just moved my addiction over to another thing. 

Anyway, it's been 13 days since I've had any nicotine at all, and I am making myself laugh out loud with my ridiculous rationalizations and/or other nagging "just one" thoughts. 

Anyways, I'm just writing to say stay strong, ride out those cravings, and check out this sub when that voice in your head really starts to sound persuasive. That's what I've been doing!

Love,

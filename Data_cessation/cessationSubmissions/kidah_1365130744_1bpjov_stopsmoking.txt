Finally had enough...

Hi there.
I've been trying to quit for awhile and i'm finally going to put forth my best effort to really do it.

I stopped smoking for about 17 days while I was on vacation, because the friend i was staying with wouldn't let me smoke while I was staying with him. It felt great. I could breathe better, and i felt better.. but when I got back home, i fell right back into old habits. 

Hopefully, this time I can stick with it. 

Any tips would be appreciated on how to deal with cravings and moodiness :)

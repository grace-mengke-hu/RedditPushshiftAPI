I had no idea I felt that bad.

26M, been smoking since I was 16.  I've lurked this sub for awhile, haven't made a 100% attempt at quitting in several years.  Holy shit guys.  I haven't smoked since Sunday (11-2-14) and I feel like a superhuman.  I had no clue how much the cigarettes were affecting my life.  I'm well rested, I magically don't have bags under my eyes, I can taste shit.  I can hold my shoulders back and stand up straight.  I don't weeze and hack at my desk during the day.  IT HASN'T EVEN BEEN 72 HOURS.

If I get to feel like this, and better, for the rest of my life....woah.  Smoking is stupid and I was stupid for a long time.

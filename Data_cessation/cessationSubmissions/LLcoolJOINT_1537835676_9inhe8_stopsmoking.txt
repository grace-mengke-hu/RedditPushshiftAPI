Withdraw more intense 2 weeks later?

Is this normal! I quit cold turkey and didnâ€™t have too bad of a withdrawal at all, felt like my body was just done with smoking. Starting yesterday afternoon I got a headache accompanied with feeling of anxiety, pessimism, and fatigue. Is this normal? Thanks for your support and props to everyone kicking this nasty habit.

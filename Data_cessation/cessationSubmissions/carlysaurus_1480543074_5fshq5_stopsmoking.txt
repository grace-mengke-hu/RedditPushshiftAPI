365 days tobacco free! Never thought this day would come!

My real "anniversary" is tomorrow, but today is the 365th day on my badge and I can't believe it's real.

After the first couple of weeks I stopped lurking around this sub so often, but you guys are 100% to thank for me sticking with it. I'll never smoke again and it was absolutely worth those first horrible weeks/months.

THANK YOU!

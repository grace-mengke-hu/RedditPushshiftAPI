1 downside to quitting...smells

It has been a week now, and I feel really good.  pretty much done with the cravings, mood has been stable and I feel much better about my self.  All good right?

The 1 thing no one mentions is that after 4 days you begin to regain your senses of smell and taste.  Having the same food that is now 10X more tasty is awesome.

Having the sense of smell like a blood hound is not so great.  I didn't remember how foul things smell.  This is compounded by riding 2 transit systems everyday.  I have come to realize the world seems to be made up of 3 smells: urine, feces, and mold/fungus/rot.

Do you get used to this over time?

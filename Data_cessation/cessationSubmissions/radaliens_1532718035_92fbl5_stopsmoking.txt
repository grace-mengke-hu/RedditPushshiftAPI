Thread appreciation

On quit day 5 and having a really hard time today. I’m 24 and been a smoker for 10 years. I’m using NRT so I’m not sure why today is harder than any other day but I’m just looking for an excuse to smoke a cigarette. “It’s just one!” “It’s not like I’ll keep smoking after one more” “I miss it, it’s like a goodbye” I know it’s irrational and I just wanted to say this thread and everyone who posts and comments is so helpful. I love the encouragement everyone gives and the progress I can see people making. It’s nice to know it gets easier. I’ll just keep reading through until the cravings pass.

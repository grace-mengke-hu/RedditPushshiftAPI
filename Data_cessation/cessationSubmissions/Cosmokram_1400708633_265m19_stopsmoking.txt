Today is my 104th day without smoking, but that feeling keeps creeping

As my title said, today is my 104th day as a non-smoker. This is my first time quitting, and I smoked about 4-7 cigarettes a day for the past 5 years. I quit cold turkey and up until now, it has been pretty smooth sailing. Lately though, past few days, I have been thinking about cigarettes more and more. Not that i need it, just that it would be pleasurable to have one. The craving doesn't last very long, and i know if i have one, i will be so disappointed in myself. Anyone else have this problem around day 100?

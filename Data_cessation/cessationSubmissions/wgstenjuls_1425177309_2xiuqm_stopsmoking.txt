Quitting smoking is going great, but I'm so hungry.

I'm five days into this non-smoking deal, and I'm having almost no problems with cigarette cravings so far. However, I am insatiably hungry. I could eat, and eat, and eat more food than I could possibly need. If I'm in a bad mood lately, it's not because I'm craving a smoke; it's because I'm hangry. It feels like I *never* eat, when I'm really eating a perfectly reasonable amount.

So, how long can I expect this to last? I can handle the nicotine cravings, but I'm struggling with this increased appetite.

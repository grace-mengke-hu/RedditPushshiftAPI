Short of breath 50 days in- WTH?!?

Officially at the 50 day mark- hooray! Feels great to be free of the albatross around my neck. So many benefits - super happy! However...2 weeks ago, I started getting short of breath just doing simple tasks like walking- not exercise walking, just walking down the block, through the airport, etc. Never was really short of breath while smoking except during vigorous intentional activity (e.g. gym, swimming, etc) And... the out of breath phenomena did not start until after 5 weeks of not smoking. Anyone else have this happen???? I am super frustrated. Going to visit the doctor to rule out any issues- but the timing is odd. Anyone else with a similar experience? Did it go away? What did you do to get over/through it? How long did it last? Any help/advice much appreciated!

Over four weeks

I was an on and off smoker for around five years, and about three years ago it became a daily habit. I didn't want to continue smoking, but it seemed to help with anxiety. It was an easy out, anytime I felt uncomfortable I'd go out for a smoke. Apparently I felt uncomfortable a lot, and smoked about a pack a day. I hated how I felt, and switched to an ecig several times. I still didn't like the feeling of addiction so I tried NRT. That didn't work either, the longest I stayed quit was about two weeks. This is the longest I've gone. I did cold turkey and suffered through several very bad weeks. All the triggers were there, but I had this subreddit to lean on and the smoke free app helped a lot as well. I will keep fighting the good fight today and every day.

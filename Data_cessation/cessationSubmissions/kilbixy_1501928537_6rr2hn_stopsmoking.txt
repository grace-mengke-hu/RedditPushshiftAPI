Super restless and insomnia after quitting

Hi all. Been smoking for about 6 years and decided to go cold turkey. It kinda just happened after I went on holiday and couldn't smoke on the plane. Decided to not buy cigarettes while away and it's been going great. About 2 weeks in at the moment and the only thing I have noticed that is proving difficult has been recent insomnia and restlessness at night when I get into bed. 
I get into bed tired but after about 5 minutes I feel hot and restless. Tossing and turning for hours and just can't sleep. Last few nights I have been in bed at 10 pm tired. However just couldn't sleep until about 3 Am. I don't use phones when I'm in bed, no other factors should be keeping me up, no coffee. How can I stop this? It's driving me nuts, im getting so tired.

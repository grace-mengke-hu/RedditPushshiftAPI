How to socialise

I quit smoking 4 days ago. All I do now is just lay in bed and being on my phone. I mean, i would like to go out, for a walk or smth, but there is only a few people I could go outside with. And they are smokers and I'm kinda scared that we won't have fun. Because usually all we did was drinking and smoking. I think that I will start to feel uncomfortable in front of my friend because we don't have what to talk about. I think I don't have confidence without my cig but I'm not even thinking to light up a single one. I just need an advice or smth. How you dealt with this? Help guys

Day one

Hey guys. I just made the decision to quit. I'm tired of the wheeze, the coughing, and the not being able to go running with my girlfriend without getting winded in 30 seconds. I'm just sick of the hold nicotine has on me, and I want it gone. No real reason to post other than I want to be able to look at this and remember why I'm trying to quit... and I suppose the reinforcement of total strangers is a good reason too. Wish me luck!

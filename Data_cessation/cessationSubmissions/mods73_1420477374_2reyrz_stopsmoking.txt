5 Days in and already £40 saved

This will be my fifth attempt at stopping in as many years.

The big difference this time is that I have given myself some coping strategies.

1.	I have a mantra.. “My family love me more than I love cigarettes”

2.	Don’t crack. “I will not allow someone else’s addiction to lead mine. (Just say no)”

3.	When I get the urge to smoke I drink water or brush my teeth.

4.	I will be rewarding my family with the money I save each week.

5.	I will be filling my newly found spare time perusing news skills (Sketching and picking up the guitar again)

6.	I will not boast to friends who still smoke so they don’t constantly ask me how well I’m doing.

Good luck to everyone else who is trying this year.

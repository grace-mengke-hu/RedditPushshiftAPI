Quit again after having relapsed

So here I am once more!
I relapsed when my (now ex-)girlfriend cheated on me, but I am now ready to quit again. This is going to be a long, grumpy week for me, but it's totally worth it. I went through withdrawal before so I know what to expect and how to counter it. Wish me luck!

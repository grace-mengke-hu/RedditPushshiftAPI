I'm better than that. My motivation + me

Warning!! Language!!! 
I made this painting to put by my front door. Motivation for myself.

I've always been the busy type. I'm athletic and smoke almost a pack a day.  The reason I can do I presume, is that I'm young(21). I'm in college have been smoking for 4 years. This is the part that makes no sense, I'm going to school to become a doctor(surgeon precisely cross my fingers). I'm actually pretty fucking smart, despite the fact that I smoke something that will inevitably kill me. Why do I smoke? I've been so fucking busy, I don't think I've actually stopped to ask myself why I'm doing it. 

Sorry I had to let that out. I know all the physical and psychological effects that will wreak havoc on my body already. I have a feeling however, with school and everything going on, Its going to hit me hard when I don't need to it. I'm going to post here as frequently as I can. I'll be looking for moral support, I just need a slap once in a while to remember how stupid it is. Given what I want to do for the rest of life(help people), why be a hypocrite. 

I needed a rant. Thanks. 

TL;DR: not worth reading, just look at the pretty picture :)

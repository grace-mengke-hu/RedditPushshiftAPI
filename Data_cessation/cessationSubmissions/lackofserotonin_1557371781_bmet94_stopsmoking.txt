dealing with withdrawal symptoms

i’ve never made a post of this sort but i’m a little desperate. i’ve been smoking on and off for the past four years since i was 18 but i hadn’t really smoked consistently enough for it to be a real problem for me until around a year and a half ago. i quit cold turkey just over a week ago. i’m not worried about starting again as self-spite/sheer power of will is all the motivation i need to stay away. what i am having trouble with is the withdrawal symptoms. particularly things that i’d already been dealing with that were made worse since quitting such as anxiety, insomnia, and heart palpitations. more specifically, racing thoughts, thought loops, and brain fog. does anyone have any suggestions in regards to things i could do that might make these symptoms a bit easier to deal with?

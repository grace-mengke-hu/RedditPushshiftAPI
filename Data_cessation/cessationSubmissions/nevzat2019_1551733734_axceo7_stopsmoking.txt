That's enough. I am quitting too.

Hi friends, After reading hundreds of posts here from several people I also decided to quit smoking too. I am 33 years old male and I smoked about 15 years. Thats enough. I know it is not going to be easy but I believe I can do that. So here we go. I will update I how feel and how it goes. See you later my friends from all around the world.

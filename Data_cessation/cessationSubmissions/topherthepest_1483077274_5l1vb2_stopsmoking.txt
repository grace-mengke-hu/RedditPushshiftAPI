I really cannot believe I'm here. And all of you have it in you as well!!!

I had tried several times to quit and every time lasted less than a week before I caved in and bought a pack or bummed a smoke from a friend. Here I am now, just two days short of a year since my last cigarette. I ACTUALLY did it. One of the most difficult and yet well worth it challenges of my life. I can tell all of you, about to attempt quitting as their New Years resolution, IT GETS EASIER, and IT's WORTH IT. You can do this!!!

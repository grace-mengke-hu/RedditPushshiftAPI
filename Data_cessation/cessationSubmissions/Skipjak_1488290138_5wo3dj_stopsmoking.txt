I caved after three months - venting and thoughts

(For some background on this story: I was a pack a day smoker for six years. I quit smoking three months ago, and this is my first quit)

I spent this weekend in Berlin to celebrate my birthday with my girlfriend. Berlin is a great city, I really enjoyed it. There is a downside to Berlin, though: it's one big smoking trigger. Alot of people still smoke there (and alot of people smoke rollies, which is what I smoked. More specifically, alot of people smoke my brand)
Smoking is still allowed inside café's and clubs. We spent quite some time in café's and clubs, obviously accompanied by (too much) alcohol.

Before I knew it, I found myself smoking after three months without smoking a single cigarette. I felt, and still feel, really disappointed with myself. I really thought I was in the clear, you know. Most of my urges and cravings were gone, I adopted a healthier lifestyle and my ability to quit smoking reassured me I have willpower and am in control. That reassurance is gone now.

I will try not to let this get to me, though. What has happened, happened. I smoked a couple of cigarettes in a trigger-rich environment fueled by alcohol and a 'fuck it, it's my birthday'-feeling. I still have the pack I bought in Berlin, it's in my unpacked suitcase. I will unpack my bags, destroy the pack, and leave it behind me. I will continue not smoking, because I know I have the willpower to do so.  I have experienced how fulfilling a smoke-free life is, and I will continue to pursue it.

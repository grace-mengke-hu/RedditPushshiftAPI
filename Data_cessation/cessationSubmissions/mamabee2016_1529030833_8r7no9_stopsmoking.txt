Attempt #3.

Attempt #1 failed miserably. 

Attempt #2 was successful. I was pregnant and had severe morning sickness. 3 week of patches and non stop vomiting and sleeping all day... lasted 15 months. Then I stupidly took it back up for that 5 minutes of alone time to have a smoke. 

So here I am attempt #3, 2 years back into smoking and have a sore throat from a flu, hoping to use this opportunity to stop smoking. Got my self the patches. Read the Allen car book (didn’t help).. I have a 2 yr old to look after so I can’t just sleep the days away this time  and don’t have that morning sickness made it unbearable to be around cigarettes but I can take my little man out and about to distract from the cravings.. usually I don’t smoke when I’m out with him because I don’t smoke around him and I don’t touch him without washing my hands after a smoke. 

I really want this to work. I hate smelling like cigarette or feeling snappy because I need a smoke. My son knows now after I eat, I go outside to smoke.. I hate it. 
It’s costing my $35 for a pack of 25s every 2 days.. that money could be put in a bank account for him. 

Who uses e cigs? Is it worth getting one? I’m not looking forward to the sleepless nights and weird rem dreams that came with last time I quit.

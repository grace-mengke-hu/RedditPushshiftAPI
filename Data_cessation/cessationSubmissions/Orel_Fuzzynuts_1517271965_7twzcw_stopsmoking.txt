Hey I just need some insight from ex-smokers.

I've been having some pain near the bottom of my diaphragm for the past two days. It's will be 5 weeks on Friday since I had my last cigarettes.  I wanted to ask if some of you had this and how long it lasted. And any other withdrawal symptoms or feelings you've had after quitting.

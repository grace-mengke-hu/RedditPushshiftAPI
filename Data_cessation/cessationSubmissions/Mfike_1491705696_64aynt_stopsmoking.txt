Passed a HUGE test!!!

I bought a new car with the money I'm saving from not smoking.  I told myself I would not ruin another car by smoking in it. So after 60 days smoke free I bought a nice car!!!

Today I was cleaning up the old car and found a pack of smokes with 3 left.  Who knows how long they had been hiding under my seat. 

I thought about smoking it- in the sense that "these used to be really important to me- I shouldn't just toss this."  Nobody would have known If I had a drag or two. And then I realized they meant nothing any more. I looked at my new car representing my newfound freedom and tossed the box!

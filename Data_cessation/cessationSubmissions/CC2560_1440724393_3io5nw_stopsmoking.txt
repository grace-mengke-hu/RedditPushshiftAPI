Doing cardio as an ex smoker

I'm closing in on 50 days. The last 3 days I finally felt good enough that I decided to go for a run in the evening, but each time, it quickly became apparent that the effect of being a mid-to-heavy smoker for 10 years is still with me. I know this is normal, but does anyone have tips for easing your lungs (and body) back into being active after all the years of damage?

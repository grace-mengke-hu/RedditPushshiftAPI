Keep posting please! You keep me motivated and I'll try and do the same for you!

(Positive Reinforcement) I've been an ex-smoker for 21 hrs now. Cold turkey. Before that I was a pack a day smoker for 10 yrs. Today went okay but better than I expected. More to come. 

I just want to let you guys/gals know you are another motivation for me. We can do this together. Thank you for all the support. 

I'm looking for support but especially to the people who have been smoking 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 years to help me now. If they can do it, so can I. I'll try and be motivation for younger ex-smoker too! Let's do this!

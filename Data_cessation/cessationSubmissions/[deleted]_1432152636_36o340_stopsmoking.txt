Tobacco free for 2 weeks+, withdrawal symptoms intensifying...

Hey, I found about this subreddit while googling about sudden acne breakouts after quit smoking.
I quit smoking about 2-3 weeks ago, and I've been having, and still having the worst time of my life. Can't concentrate on anything, having some serious appetite issues (either I don't want to eat, or I have sudden craves for massive meals), and in the last couple of days, I've been noticing a massive tiny pimple breakout on my face and body.
I'm a 21 y/o male, I've been smoking for 6 years, I've been trying to quit for the last 3 years, but with no luck due to being a soldier. As soon as I finished my service, I realized that I must quit. So, after a few months of preparations, I've decided to make the move. I'm tobacco free since the beginning of the month (May 2015). I must note that I begun working in a demanding job, and I could not, and still can't concentrate on my work anymore, everything goes around the constant battle with going out and smoking a cigarette. I'm not sure how my case is similar to others, but somehow I just feel a bit better just by posting this out there.

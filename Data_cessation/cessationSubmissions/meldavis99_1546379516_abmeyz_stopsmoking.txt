I have tried to quit smoking 5 times in the last year

Each and every one of those times was unsuccessful. I couldn't make it past 1-2 days, and had plenty of excuses in the interim. 

&amp;#x200B;

I had friends and family member supporting me, but it didn't matter. I still couldn't quit this nasty, awful habit. 

&amp;#x200B;

Each time, I psyched myself up, checked off all the "pre-quitting" check marks I should do, and each time I failed. And it frustrated me to no end. 

&amp;#x200B;

The past couple of times, I didn't even bother telling anyone. I felt, if I make it past 2 days, I'll let them know, because I'm beginning to feel pretty stupid saying I'm going to quit, and then give in. And then have to say that I gave in.   


And those last 2 times, I gave in. I knew I was going to fail. 

&amp;#x200B;

And that's the thing. 

&amp;#x200B;

Knowing and believing in yourself is the biggest ally you are going to have when you decide to quit smoking. It helps to have a support system - it helps so much. However, without having yourself on your side, it's not going to work.

I flew down to visit my friends and family over the holiday last week. The first day I got into town, I was hit hard with allergies. I made it through Christmas, and a few other days I had planned, but 2 days before I planned to come back home I was down for the count. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, the particular allergies in the air usually hit me hard, and knock me out for a day or two. But this time it was longer. I have been back 2 days now, and am not adding to the daily sniffles and sneezes, but I'm more congested than usual. Enough for it to have cancelled a few plans with people I have not seen in months. 

&amp;#x200B;

I sat here yesterday, in my house - cleaning up and taking mental inventory lists for the next year, thinking that there is not a single reason for this. There is not a single reason why I should keep doing this to myself. I obviously want to quit. I've been trying like hell over the past year. And this needs to end. 

&amp;#x200B;

And it does. 

&amp;#x200B;

I usually take a personal inventory at the end of each year. I feel it helps me with my personal goals and personal growth. What I accounted for this past year was pretty impressive. 

&amp;#x200B;

I moved up in my career. I transferred to another state and am living far away from my comfort zone for the first time in my life - and I'm succeeding.  In most other aspects of my life, I am completely confident in myself and have no reason not to believe in myself. 

&amp;#x200B;

So it's pretty damn stupid to have such little faith and confidence in my ability to crush this habit for good. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been through and overcome too many things in my lifetime to simply succumb to some stupid addiction to a stick of nicotine. So why haven't I ever put my faith behind me? 

&amp;#x200B;

That is a question I can't answer, but that is a failure I can no longer overlook. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have no reason not to believe in me. I've gotten where I am because of my personal belief in myself. I've put hat effort into my own career. I can do this. I can believe in myself. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I start doing that today. I will build my support system, but I will have my own back, first and foremost. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am going to check in here everyday and give an update, but I no longer have any doubts about my ability to do this. To quit, once and for all. I believe in me, and that's what will break me from this habit.

Over a month in and its getting harder???

So I'm pretty busy and I'm gonna keep this short.  But lately since maybe last week I've been getting strong subtle cravings to the point of like "its ok just have one" and such going through my mind.  So much so I got in a fight with my wife about it.  Is this a normal part of quitting?  Like the relapse stage?   BTW I still haunt smoked since my badge started though.

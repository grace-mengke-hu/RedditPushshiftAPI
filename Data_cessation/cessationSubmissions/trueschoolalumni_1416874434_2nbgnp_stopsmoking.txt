28 days later...

I've been smoking pretty much non-stop for the last 16-17 years. Almost a packet a day. Tried Champix (Australian version of Chantix) twice, it worked well enough for me to stop, but then I stopped taking the medication before the end of the 3 months and I got tempted to light up when drinking with mates. I'd tried cold turkey in the past, but never got further than a few days. I'd tried patches, but still felt like smoking when drinking (can you work out what one of my triggers is?). All up, I'd probably made about 7 or 8 quit attempts.

Well this time I am determined to be successful. I read Allen Carr's book, got motivated and stubbing out that last cigarette was a relief more than anything. First few days were filled with cravings, but they went away. The mental habits were easy enough to break too, just reminding myself, "I don't do that anymore."

For those of you struggling through the first few days of nicotine cravings, let me tell you it does get better. I have grumbled my way through the valley of the shadow of no smokes and come out the other side. And if there's one thing I have learned, it's that the future is looking beautiful. Don't worry - you got this. If I can do it, you mos def can.

EDIT: The good people of r/stopsmoking have been awesome support as well.

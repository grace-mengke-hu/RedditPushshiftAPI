Goddamnit

8 months, yeah, 8 months I haven't smoked one cigarette! And what do I do? I fuck it up, goddamnit.

Okay to sum things up, recently I've been having very vivid dreams and strong cravings (well not recently, I had them all the time, but they've come back suddenly) these have been on and off, anyway I was biking and and came to a stop sign and stopped to check my phone (got off the road of course), and then this guy in his pickup truck stops at the sign, lights a cig, takes one drag and then just throws it out??? I was shocked, what a waste of a cigarette, and it was a Newport! Those things are $7 a pack around here, but I know it was a Newport because as soon as he threw out a full cigarette, my urges got the best of me, I instantly waited for him to drive away and I picked it up, it was still lit, and inhaled the fucker, goddamn it was so good, I sat down by a tree, I loved every second, until after which I began to hate myself, I was so dizzy It took forever to get home. But goddamnit I'm just really pissed at myself, 8 months smoke free! (Side note, I was a Newport smoker so the fact that it was a newport made it that harder to resist)

Now I'm home, at my computer, I've resisted the urge to go buy a pack of Ports, actually I don't have the urge to buy a pack. I just feel like shit, oh well.

Kind of a pointless shitpost, but it felt good to get my failure out there, sorry to my lungs and blood pressure/heart rate, took a couple aspirin and gonna excercise harder tomorrow. fuck

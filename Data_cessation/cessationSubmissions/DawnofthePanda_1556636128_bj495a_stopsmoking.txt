some advice

As somebody who recently stopped smoking, I just wanted to give you some advice! 

You are addicted, your addiction is a sickness from which you can get better! But I think the key is to accepted that nicotine is not something you consume without reason, smoking has its purpose in your life (relaxes you; rewards you;...(write down what that purpose is and find alternatives for it)). 

Quitting is a bitch, but it can be done, weaker people then you have done it, just remember that cravings come and go!!! They are waves, they might make you feel like you are going insane now but they will be gone in 10 min. After a view days you learn that you can manage your cravings and in a couple of weeks you sort of forget about them. The cigarettes that you are craving do not reduce your craving but cause it!! 

Good luck on your journey and remember to enjoy your cigarettes because one day you will miss them badly. :D

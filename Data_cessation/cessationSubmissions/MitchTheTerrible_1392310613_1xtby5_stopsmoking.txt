Set a date to quit, now what?

Hey y'all, I've been lurking here for a while constantly thinking that I'd quit soon and not doing anything about it but I've finally decided that it's time for me to take the big leap once and for all. I've set a date to quit in a little more than a week and I'd like to know if there's anything else I should be doing in the little time I have before I quit. Any tips whatsoever would be much appreciated. Thanks a bunch people, stay strong.

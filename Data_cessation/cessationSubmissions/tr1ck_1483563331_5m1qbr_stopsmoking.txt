Day One, using the patch and feeling light headed

I put the first patch on last night, I did have some weirdly awesome dreams, though I may stop putting it on at night if it turns out I can't sleep.  So at the moment I am feeling light headed and am having a hard time concentrating.  Is this normal?  Is it because I haven't had an actual cigarette in 15ish hours?  Or is this a side effect of the patch?

Also, people who used the patch starting with Step 1, did you actually use the Step 1 patch for 6 weeks?

1 year without smoking!!

Thankyou r/stopsmoking you were there when I needed you. This sub motivated me to quit and not give up more than you can think. I quit cold turkey and the first few days were the toughest! I was cranky and irritable. As months passed by the cravings went away. I still think of smoking from time to time but I know better. Now I can even drink without craving a cigarette. 

If I can do it. You all can too! Keep fighting the good fight. And if you are new into the quit get the Allan Carr's easyway book. It really helped me!

Cigarettes are lying to us!

 First, i'm 15 days smoke free. Second, it's my 2nd serious attempt. 15 days ago I was smoking for 7 years between 15-20 a day, and i am 26 now. 
 On my first attempt i stayed smoke free for 7 months, then i had a crazy exam and i relapsed. I was stupid. After that, i was too afraid to stop, because: CIGARETTES ARE LYING TO US. They make you feel weak. If you are a former smoker, in your first days, did you observe how fast the other smokers see that you quit? Everyone is like "hei...! Did you quit? :o". That is because they fear they will be the last on the ship that is sinking (Allen Carr reference). 
 On my first attempt (3yr ago) i happily quit with Allen Carr's book, but then i read it 2 times (this year) and it didnt work. Anyone else feel the same?
 Also, can you read Allen Carr's Easy Method even after you quit? Anyone else tried this?
 I'm really proud of myself, it's not much 15 days, but i like it. 
 Also, i advice you to not tell anybody for the longest period you can, because it can motivate you to continue!

 All the best!

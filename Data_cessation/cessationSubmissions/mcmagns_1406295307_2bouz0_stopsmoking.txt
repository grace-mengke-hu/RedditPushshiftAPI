I will need some help and support.

Hi everyone, I have tried to quit smoking every single day during the last 3 weeks, I usually last 2-3 hours before I light up again :(. 

I realize i need all the help and support i can get, thats why i'm here.

Right now I'm going to go outside, smoke two cigarettes (nr 2 will taste like absolute asshole) piss on the remaining cigarettes and make the promise of never smoking again.

Been smoking for 6 years, 20 a day smoker.

**Update 1:** No-smoking for 15 hours

Just woke up and brought a cup of coffee outside (this is usually the time for my first smoke) I feel good at the moment, I managed to go to the store last night without buying smokes and I have not felt any cravings yet. 

**Update 2:** 24 hours without a smoke :).  Last 4-5 hours have been a little harder. 

**Update 3:** 48 hours now, today have been easier. I'm starting to belive that I'm able to pull this quit off.

**Update4:** 72 hours free. Today was the first day in the office after my quit, much harder then I thought it would be. 2 friendly ex-smokers helped me out and encouraged me to keep on going when I felt like giving up.

Back home now and I'm feeling so much better now :)

**Update 5** 97 hours, worst day thus far. smokesmokesmoke, only thing on my mind today. I need a change of tactics fast or I'm afraid I will fail this quit.

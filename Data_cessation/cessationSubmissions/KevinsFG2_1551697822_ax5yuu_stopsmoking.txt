I'm blown away

So I've lurked on reddit for a long time and finally decided to finally post and this is the first subreddit I wanted to hit. My title explains it all. I see the badges that people have and how many days people have achieved and it just makes me wonder if I'll ever get those numbers. I hat how much I smoke and just don't know where to even start. I hate how much I am smoking and Ive realized they have me hooked. Sorry just a rant.

How does smoking joints interfere with trying to quit?

I've been wanting to quit for a while and today is the last day I'm a smoker (hopefully of course) and have been lurking here for a while. Since I've been contemplating quitting for a while now, I know 'the basics'. Main thing to avoid seems to be having 'just one', I get that and it makes perfect sense but as I also smoke marijuana from time to time (always with tobacco) and I don't want to quit with that (yet) I was wondering how much it interferes with trying to quit.

I have exams starting the end of may so I won't be blazing until mid-june anyway so I figured by then I will have been an ex-smoker for over a month (again, hopefully) and the cravings would be manageable. With that in mind, will smoking a joint still be as hurtful (towards trying to quit) as it would be, say, next week?

Obviously, I don't have a lot of experience with cravings at all so any help regarding cravings would be nice.

Main question: will lighting up a joint kill me in terms of cravings afterwards? And will it be a setback to day 1?

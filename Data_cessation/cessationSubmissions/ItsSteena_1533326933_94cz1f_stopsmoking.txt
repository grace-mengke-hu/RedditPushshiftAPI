Lost interest in coffee. Is this normal?

I'm 11 and a half days "clean" of cigarettes. Strangely, I used to also be a very heavy coffee drinker. I'd drink it from the moment I woke up until bed time. Since I quit smoking, I have zero interest in coffee. It's not that it tastes bad or anything like that...it just doesn't hit "the spot" or something. I'm still vaping nicotine. I don't really mind the newfound distaste for coffee, I'm just curious if this has happened to anyone else, and also curious about the potential reasoning behind it.

Will it be as difficult trying the second time?

I used the patch and was miserable for a month but then successfully got through 3 months without smoking. I was in a very good place until I was a little blindsided by a life event and caved just over a week ago. Since then I've ramped back up in mere days to a half pack a day.

If I cut it out now and quit again... today... will I be just as miserable as the first time? Is it worth doing the last step of the patch once again. I desperately want to kick this.

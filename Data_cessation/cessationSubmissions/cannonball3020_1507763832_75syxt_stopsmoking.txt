Day 12. My personal life is dying and I need your help Reddit.

I’ve used tobacco since I was 16. I’m 28 now and decided to quit cold turkey. No chew, no vape pen, no gum, nothing. Cold fucking turkey.  I have tried to quit for years and finally got the balls to do it for real. Last night my gf of three years left due to a huge fight. She said she couldn’t take my anger and lashing out anymore. I left to buy smokes and I couldn’t bring myself to do it. I’m on thin ice with my job for my bad attitude the last couple of weeks. I have officially alienated myself from anyone who cares and I know it will all go back to normal if I just give in and just start smoking. I can’t take it anymore, I’m depressed, I don’t sleep, I don’t eat, and I have never been so fucking angry for so long in my entire life. I need your help. Is it a smarter decision to just smoke or should I keep this agonizing journey that is destroying my life. I just want this to stop. Like a nightmare that I can’t wake up from. Please help me.

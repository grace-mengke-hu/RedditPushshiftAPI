Do you have elderly parents on a fixed income? Why not give them your cigarette money if you are able?

I fully understand that a lot of people are quitting for financial reasons and that they aren't able to do so and that is fine. But if you are able, why not? Especially if they are non-smokers and have asked you to quit in the past... They will be proud of you for quitting and they get a little extra money. 

For the record, I did not go into my quit with the intention of doing this... It just sort of happened. My parents are both 73 in the US and they live off of social security. My mom has all of the stuff that goes along with getting old and my dad has Alzheimer's along with diabetes, and kidney and liver failure. The meds aren't cheap for any of it. 

I decided to send them what financial support I could and it worked out to be nearly the same amount that I would have spent on cigarettes every month. When I look at it from that angle, it feels better.

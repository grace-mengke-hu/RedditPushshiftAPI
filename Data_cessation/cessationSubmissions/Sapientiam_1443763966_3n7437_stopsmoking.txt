The media is trying to make me backside...

Every time I read a book or watch a movie or see a show on TV... everyone is smoking, it was never an issue in the past, I never even really noticed, now it's the only thing I see... I've been smoke free 94 days, not a puff, but I swear that Al Calavicci and his ubiquitous cigar on Netxlix reruns of Quantum Leap are going to push me off the wagon... 

Does this ever go away or am I stuck noticing every stray wisp of smoke in everything I see or read?

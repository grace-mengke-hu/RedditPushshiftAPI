Thanks to my PPO, I finally understand carbon tax!

I've attempted to quit many times over the last seven years.  It finally stuck this time because my health insurance charges smokers a 50 dollar a month premium; that financial motivation really helped me stick to it! 

Sorry, not sorry for the title.

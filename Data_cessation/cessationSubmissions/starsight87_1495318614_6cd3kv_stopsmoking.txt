Day 15- there are definitely bad days

Well past the physical cravings and withdrawal there are the day to day aspects of the absence of smoking that are challenging. I am an anxious person and smoking often was a go to answer for me to just get space and stand outside to recharge the energy needed to be social. Without it I find myself discouraged and a bit lost with how I interact. 

Most of all I am tired of that irritable feeling and distance I put between myself and other people over the last two weeks. I am proud of what I have accomplished but I want life to return back to normal and feel like I am a positive force around my family and friends. It feels selfish to be this vulnerable and yesterday/today I just felt guilty.

I will keep fighting my way through this but needed to share with a group that I could trust and understands the struggle. 

Thank you

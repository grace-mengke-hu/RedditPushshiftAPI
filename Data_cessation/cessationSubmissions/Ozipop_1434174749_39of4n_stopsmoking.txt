God Damn I want to!

So just a rant to help me get through this craving. Work was going great, crazy busy but we just kept pushing through it. Then the front got tired and it all got bad. No feedback, no eyes on, just onslaught of huge tickets. I know that smoking wont make it be smooth again. I know that I deserve to get to go home a smell sweet so I can kiss my daughter. Nicotine is such an evil demon, trying to trick me or trap me at every corner. I deserve the good health that come from taking care of my body. I deserve the time Ill get to spend with my kids and grandkids. I deserve to be the master of my time and not a slave to the nictotine overlords.

That helped!

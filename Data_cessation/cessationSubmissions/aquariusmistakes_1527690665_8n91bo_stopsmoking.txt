I have 3 cigarettes left.

I'm 34 and have been smoking for many years now, in the last year a very stressful relationship has contributed to my increased smoking. Last night around 8 PM I bought a pack and while up most of the night talking to my mother and friends about my relationship, I smoked almost the whole pack. When I met him, a year and 3 months ago, I only smoked max 5 cigarettes a day. 

I have decided that these last 3 will be my last. I've tried buying a pack and saying I will go back to just 4 like the past and wean myself down. But the truth is, when I get stressed, i need to distract myself and I find myself smoking 2 or 3 in a row. Today I decided I am done. Because cold turkey is the best way to go. As long as I have that crutch of a pack there then I will continue to lean on it. So after these last 3, I vow to myself that I am done. I will not let my addiction kill me. I will not let a stressful relationship contribute to my death.

I'm glad to have found this sub because when i am weak I can come here and get the support that I need.

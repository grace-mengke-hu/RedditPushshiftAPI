Day three - dreaming again

So it's been day three since I've quit, and I've had violent dreams, with some form of smoking always present in them. Wake up with urges, but I this subreddit is helping.

Right now, the dreams are good, a refreshing change to my otherwise unremarkable nights. Is this normal though? I know it's not because of quitting weed as well, for I've gone phases without weed and only tobacco. Also, will they stop once I'm out of withdrawal?

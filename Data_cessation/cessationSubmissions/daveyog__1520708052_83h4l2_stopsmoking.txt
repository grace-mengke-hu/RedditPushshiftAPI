Reddit, what do you substitute for cigarettes?

Hey! I'm new to this sub and I just wanted to give this askreddit style question a go. I stopped counting times I "stopped" smoking long time ago, eventually I'll always end up picking this horrible habit again. Sometimes I'll make it few days, sometimes a month. 

I've read some of the posts here about other people's successes and many of their inspirational stories and I feel like it's time to stop smoking myself again - this time for good, hopefully. 

My question is - what do you substitute for nicotine? I believe a lot of people, myself included, use it as a stress relief thing. But what can you do to get relieved without a smoke you're already used to having? Imagine you're at work, something's not going your way etc. and the only thing on your mind is "I'm going to have a cigarette". 

I tried electronics, nicotine pills, patches but it's all a big ol' pile of doodle. I mean it works for a little while but doesn't really help you to get off it. 

Eating healthy and/or hitting the gym is great therapy but what do you do at THE moment you would normally have had a cigarette?

Thanks and good luck to everyone!

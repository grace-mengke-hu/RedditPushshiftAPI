Replaced cigarettes with nicotine mints a couple years ago and now it’s time to quit the mints.

I’m wondering if there are any non nicotine mini mints that have the similar feel to help keep cravings at bay. Also curious to people’s withdraw symptoms, is it as bad as quitting cigarettes, will the symptoms last as long, what can I expect. Do you feel healthier now without the nicotine. I feel a thousand times better than I did when I was a smoker, but I know nicotine isn’t healthy. I’m pretty nervous as I already have pretty bad anxiety, it was hard to switch over to the mints but well worth it. Just need to take the next step!

day 6-7 with champix (varenicline)

hi all

&amp;#x200B;

yes, i did try quitting before with will power but i didn't had any lack with it. 

&amp;#x200B;

i think i in the 3th year of trying quit smoking weed and cigarettes  

&amp;#x200B;

the best score that i had was 42 days without weed but still smoked cigarettes, it wasn't bad but still i had that fight to live throughout days..

&amp;#x200B;

now didn't prepare myself into it by smoking less, like any try that i had. but now i will try it, maybe it will work.   

&amp;#x200B;

i eat before i take the pill, after drink water or some tea.

didn't any problems expect from the dreams. but yeah to have good time..

&amp;#x200B;

still smoking

&amp;#x200B;

bye :)

FML - hope this is it!

40 years old, on and off again smoker (quitting smoking is easy, do it all the time) and today is the day.  1st of the month.  A Monday.  I am not 41 years old yet, so I quiet when I was 40.

****ARGH, can't figure out how to do bullets...

CONS:
- NO more visits to the forest preserve to enjoy a smoke break - NO more visits to my secret hiding spots (have like 10 of them)
- NO more nights out enjoying a smoke with the neighbor wife
- NO more looking forward to a smoke in the rain
- NO more smoking in the fall weather
- NO more smoking when the snow starts to fall
- NO more walking dog for a quick smoke
- NO more early dark morning smokes
- NO more after gaming marathon smoking
- NO smoking when I go to the Journey concert later this month (argh)
- NO more fall fire pit parties where I can sit, relax, talk and enjoy a smoke

PROS:
- YES I can kiss kids goodnight (could not do this after a smoke)
- YES wife won't complain that I smoke
- YES save some money
- YES no more pain in chest or anxiety from smoking
- YES no more smelling like shit
- YES can take bus and not worry about how I smell
- YES no more hiding that I smoke from friends and family
- YES car will be much, much cleaner


Wish me luck  :(

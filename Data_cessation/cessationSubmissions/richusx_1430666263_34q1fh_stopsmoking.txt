Finally after 3 years of smoking, I realized how badly It's affecting me

I'm 16 years old and I started smoking when I was 13 because of family issues. For last year I've been smoking at least a pack a day. Yesterday morning while I smoked my last cigarette I realized how this is affecting me in a negative way and switched to low nicotine vaping. I noticed the difference and I know it's only my first proper day smoke free I feel much better. I plan on cutting off vaping within next 6 months.

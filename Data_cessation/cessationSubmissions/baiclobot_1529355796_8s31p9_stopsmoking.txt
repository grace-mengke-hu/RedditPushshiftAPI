Like I promised, it’s Monday and I’m done. I just smoked my last cigarette ever.

I’m feeling good about it. I know I might not feel so great about it in a few hours but fuck it. I set today as my quit day. I stretched my pack to last all weekend. I just smoked the last one and I’m finished for good. I’m about to toss my lighters and my ashtray. I’ve got my yoga mat &amp; a sketch book ready ready as distractions and I’m starting CBD oil because I’ve heard wonderful things about how it takes just the slightest edge off. I am a non-smoker. I will do this thing that beats my ass every time but fuck it. I can do this.

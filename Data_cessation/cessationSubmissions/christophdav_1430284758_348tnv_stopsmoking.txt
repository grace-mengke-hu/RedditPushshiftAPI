Ready to end this.

I decided as of 2:00 after my last cigarette that I am done. I read the magical book which helped greatly but my biggest motivation is to stop being an out of shape fuck. I always convinced myself of stupid ideas in order to allow me to keep smoking. My only small worry is my peers and those around me at school. I go to a small school for advertising portfolio building and no matter what, someone is outside smoking a cig. I just know its so damn easy to simply bum one. Either way this is it. I know it is. I won't keep falling into this pit.
 
Good luck to anyone else on this step to a better future.

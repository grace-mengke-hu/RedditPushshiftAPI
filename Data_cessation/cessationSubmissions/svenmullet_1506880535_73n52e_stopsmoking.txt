I quit smoking 5 years ago today!

The only advice I can give is that you have to want to quit, you should read Allen Carr's Easyway to Stop Smoking, and whatever you do, don't waste your time and sanity with "cessation aides" or anything containing nicotine; just stop cold turkey. You've been conditioned by the tobacco companies to believe that it's nearly impossible to quit, but in reality it is a simple matter of willpower, ignoring mild discomfort for a few days, avoiding smokers for at least a few months (yes, you will very likely lose a friend or two in the process, it is worth it though) and most important of all: realize that smoking is just a form of addiction; the cigarette is just a delivery method for nicotine, much like a syringe is for heroin. It is not smoking you are addicted to, it's nicotine, and the withdrawal is relatively mild (comparable to being slightly hungry.) Once you've completely flushed all traces of it from your body, you only have to remain vigilant and not start smoking again (although I can't imagine why anyone would.) Every minute of every day, I feel exactly like a smoker does right after they have a smoke- the reason is because nicotine doesn't actually have any psychoactive effects, in fact the only effect is has is withdrawal discomfort when the amount of it in your body is diminishing. You have trained yourself that this discomfort goes away when you have a smoke, and eventually associate smoking with stress relief. Point is, the stress wouldn't be there if you didn't smoke, so it's an insidious vicious circle.

I think the best reason for quitting is because it stinks, annoys everyone else, ruins your health and costs a lot of money. But whatever your reason is, I say DO IT.

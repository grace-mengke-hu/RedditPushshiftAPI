i'm 18 and fucking hell

been smoking for a year now. Goes really well with a drink, I associate having a beer with a smoke now. I enjoy the act of smoking, and the social side of it- made some new friends by being out in the smoking area, including my girlfriend.

But fuck, just dawned on me what I'm setting myself up for here. I need to fucking quit. I only have less than 5 a day, but I never go a day without now, I just enjoy it too much if i'm walking somewhere, or sitting about my house.

I thought that this was just a fucking game, but it's not. I can feel my breath getting shorter, and I'm coughing up mucus all the time, with winter approaching and all.

Would an ecig be a good shout, or should I just try and end it at the bud, seeing as I don't think I have a full blown physical addiction- that is if I don't smoke I don't feel shit or whatever

Just wrote this down, may delete it in the morning.

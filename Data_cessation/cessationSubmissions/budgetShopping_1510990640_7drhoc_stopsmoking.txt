Impulsively quitting

I decided to go cold turkey pretty much on a whim. I threw away my last pack of Camel with maybe 12 cigs left in it. I'm now on 1 day and 7 hours completely nicotine/smoke-free. I had only smoked for three months before that my entire life, although I was up to a pack a day when I quit. So I gotta admit, it's tough quitting. I've already tried quitting a couple of times. I usually relapse into thinking that I couldn't really be doing myself much harm continuing for a few more weeks/months, and then postpone quitting for a bit. But it's a trap, right? It'll only make the habit stick harder.

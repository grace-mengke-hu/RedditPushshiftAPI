I've tried countless times to quit

I've tried countless times to quit and always relapse.  I'll go a day or so and then just start back.  I don't know why I even smoke.  I don't even inhale.  I quit once years ago for about eight months then started back.  I really want to quit.  Seems like I just can't do it.

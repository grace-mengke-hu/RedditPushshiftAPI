Help needed

I've been smoke free for 9 days, almost 10. Slipped up and had two yesterday and one today. I'm not giving up but why does it seem easy to "cheat"??? Side note: the first good relationship I've had in 4 years (since my divorce) and the guy just broke up with me basically bc he's not willing to try.

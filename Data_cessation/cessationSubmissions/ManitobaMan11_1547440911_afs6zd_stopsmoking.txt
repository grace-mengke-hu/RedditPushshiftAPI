Set my Quit date... have tried and failed before... a few questions for everyone!

Hi, first reddit post. Thanks in advance for taking the time to read. 3 months ago I gave up the bottle and drug use, I figure now itâ€™s time to get rid of maybe the most difficult vice to part with.... smoking.

I have tried to quit before, made it 1.5 months before I eventually caved. Has anybody tried champix? Any other aids that come with a good recommendation?

Thanks

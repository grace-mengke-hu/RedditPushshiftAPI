Ready again?

Next week is my birthday & I really want to stop smoking..

I've been on a pack or more a day for about 18 years.

Late last year I read allen carrs book & got to 3 weeks before a whole heap of things happened & I bought a pack, was back to 20 a day in less than a week & have been kind of upset about it since then.

The reason I started again was because my mind was utterly consumed by the thought of smoking for the entire 3 weeks! I read that cravings would decrease in frequency & eventually I'd just forget about it but this really wasn't the case at all! Every 5 minutes I'd be thinking about cigarettes & in the end I had to give in to shut up my brain.

I still have a fear of quitting & I don't know what to do. 

I bought a vape but it makes as much sense as sucking a dildo so I don't really think it's a great alternative...

How can I get back to feeling marvellous?

First time around I threw all the cigs & lighters in the lake & was happy about it but now I keep doubting & running to the shop.

Help!

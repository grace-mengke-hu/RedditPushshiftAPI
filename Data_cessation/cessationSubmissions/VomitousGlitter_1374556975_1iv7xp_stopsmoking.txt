I started smoking again after just under 3 months of having quit.

Goddammit. I quit on July 1st, haven't touched one since, and had no real impulse to do so. I felt totally awesome about it. But my boyfriend broke up with me very very recently (who was partially the reason I quit), and things are very ambiguous between us at the moment. He's going through some stuff, says he really wants to be with me and cares for me a great deal, but can't handle a relationship at the moment. And I respect that, but I don't know where that leaves me and the suspense is killing me and I'm miserable and I can't sleep or eat or really function very well and smoking is distracting at least. I've been writing and watching movies and listening to music but honestly all I want to do right now is smoke until my lungs give out. I have to attend my own graduation party on Saturday and I'm dreading having to tell everyone what happened and why he isn't there and some of his friends are coming and just. Ugh.

I feel like I'm using smoking as both an emotional and social escape. I sleep all day and then go out of the house and turn my phone off and smoke all evening. No one can reach me and I don't have to deal with people or feelings and I know this is unhealthy and I want to stop but right now I just need something to help me not cry all of the time. I'm sorry, I don't really know if this post belongs in this subreddit, I guess I'm just looking for reassurance that I'm not a total failure for fucking up my progress. I'm smoking more now than I ever did before and I feel ridiculously guilty. I don't know. Thanks for reading this, I'm sure I sound like an awful whiny little shit and I'm sorry for that, but if you have any advice I'm open to it.

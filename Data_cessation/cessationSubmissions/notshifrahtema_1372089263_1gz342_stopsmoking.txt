Help me help myself, please!

I've been smoking on and off for over fifteen years. I have a lovely wife that I hurt every time I light up and a three year old daughter that I hide it from. I wish that I could quit but I don't really want to. I want to want to. I am in the worst shape  of my life and feel like shit. My wife supports me and is just waiting for me to quit while making it clear that she does not approve and it makes her sad. I disrespect myself and my wife every time I light up, but I cannot stop! I have been brought to tears a few times thinking about it, yet I still don't have the drive to quit. The times that I did quit (for a few years) I missed smoking, like actually emotionally missed it. For a short time I didn't tell my wife that I started again which caused me to smoke much much less because I had to hide it. Of course, the whole being open and honest thing got in the way and now that she knows, I smoke allot more than I did. I don't know what I'm looking for here, maybe this is just a step in the journey of quitting. I have told people a number of times that I quit, only to fail and start again. Now I don't tell anyone when I try to quit to avoid the embarrassment of failure, but that makes it easier to fail. I don't know what to do. I am at a complete and total loss. Thanks for listening Reddit.

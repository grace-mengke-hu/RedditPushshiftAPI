Do spliffs count?

Was a cigarette smoker for 4 years but have quit and haven’t smoked one for 3 months now.

I do still sometimes smoke a bit of marijuana and I like to roll if in spliffs ( for anyone who’s not familiar spliff = tobacco mixed with weed - for me its a 30/70 t/w ratio)

Was wondering if I smoke one spliff in about two weeks which is about half a cigarette am I still doing a lot of damage to my health and can I even say I have quit?

5 th day thoughts

Smoke free since 5 days. 

I went for drinks 2 days back,  which was my 3rd day after quitting.  Resisting to smoke while drinking is one of the hardest thing i had done in a while.  I kept talking to myself about being strong.  I held the drink in my left hand all the time (my smoking hand).  When it was too difficult I got a toothpick and pretended that i was smoking a cigarette.  That really helped me and eased me.  But i will try to avoid drinks henceforth as much as possible. In cases where I cant i will prepare my self,  by reading my reasons to quit, talking to my self about how much i have already acheived and i will not give in to that single drag as well.  Not a drag,  no matter what. 

To everyone out there,  who enjoys drinking with their buddies,  you can not let that be a reason for not quitting.  Let your friends know that you are trying.  Use the toothpick trick.  Remember if you can quit cigarettes,  you can acheive alot in other aspects of your life.  Even though i am just on my 5th day,   I can already feel the motivation to do all the things i always wanted to do but never did it.  

I hope these words help someone out there.  

Thanks for reading and i am thankful for this group.

Fell off the wagon a couple months ago, words of encouragement or advice appreciated

It's the same story you've seen posted a hundred times. I quit cold turkey for a year and a half. I loved not being a smoker, it seemed like this switch just flipped and I didn't think about it any more. Somehow started having one now and again when I was drinking and now I smoke every time I drink, which is a couple times a week usually. It feels like shit and I can't seem to just flip the switch off again. When I had the momentum of several months behind me it was way harder to justify a slip up, but now my twisted addict logic is that I had one not that long ago, so I'm not erasing any progress by having one now. The first time I quit so easily because I was living with my parents in a city where none of my friends smoked but now I'm on my own and I'm around smokers a lot more. Only one of my friends smokes but we sort of enable one another and whenever he's not around I go off and find someone and bum one.  
  
 Anyway, I guess I'll give Easy Way another read and start my quitting app over but I already feel so defeated because my discipline has been complete shit lately and I feel like I'm making the same mistakes over and over. Sorry for venting :P

First week without smoking.

This is it guys. First week.
I've been smoking since I was 15 (now 21). Been smoking two packs a week. I stopped smoking last weekend and it's been hard. Many sleepless nights, nightmares and anxiety. I bet you guys have had these kinds of problems and I was wondering how did you get past them? 

One main reason to quit smoking for me was that I wan't to be able to run a half marathon next summer. I started running more this week and it has been good so far. 

Tl;dr. Quit smoking about week ago, problems

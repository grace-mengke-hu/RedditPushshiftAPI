Smoking is cool

Provocatory title, isn't it.

39 days today, 6 years 30 cigs a day. 27 y/0, 185 cm x 90 kg. Never exercised, I'm unemployed at the moment so all my day I sit on a desk looking for opportunities. I also have a start of porn related ED, I'm scared as hell but I can't fight two monsters at the same time. Quitting porn seems ten times harder than quitting smoking, even if watching porn makes me a beta male, but for now is the only way to release tension.

Started last December with Carr's book and a flu that kept me in bed without smoking for a couple of days. 

Almost no cravings except for the first days and some when I'm upset.

I want to SHARE my "0 cravings" strategy and ASK for an advice.
My strategy, the one that worked flawlessly for me for the first month, involved preparing the battlefield before the cold turkey stop. Expecially my first and most important rule for the first month.

NEVER BE BORED. Preapare yourself for that, because I truly know that's the only reason why I'm a non smoker now. When I was bored the desire to light a cig was enormous, and I tried different activities to save me from lighting again.

But I have some problems with my virtual image of a successful guy, I need avices from the veterans and anyone that went past the first months. I miss cigarettes for one reason: they made me look cool. And since I started smoking, the same confidence made me get twice the chicks I got when I wasn't a smoker.

So.

1. What do you do when you're absolutely mad and nervous
2. How to change the mindset that smoking is cool, and everything self esteem related
3. How to fight ex smokers telling you that you quit because you're a loser, you didn't have "control" as they have (some of them they're right, I know everyone's different but they can keep weekends without a cigarette and then occasionally smoke)

Thanks, I'm with you

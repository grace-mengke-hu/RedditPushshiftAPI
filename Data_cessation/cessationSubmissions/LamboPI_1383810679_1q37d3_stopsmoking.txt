When does the abundant energy come? Day 13 and I have the hardest time getting out of bed.

Ignore the badge I failed that quit and chose ignorance for awhile but this time I'm back and feeling really good about it... Except first thing in the morning. I'm not even craving at that time, I'm just so dead tired and feel like I can hardly move. When does that energy boost everybody talks about kick in?

Things that are helping me stay quit. What’s helping you?

Things that have helped me stay quit so far.
1.  I started the day we were leaving for vacation.  I think the change of scenery helped, but knew I’d have triggers when I got home so I prepared beforehand for those.
2.  Using the Nicolette Lozenges, regularly.  I have them with me at all times.
3.  I’m avoiding friends who smoke until I feel stronger.  That’s huge.
4.  I’m trying to go gentle with myself on the slight weight gain.  Right now quitting smoking is more important.
5.  Going outside more and trying to stay busier.
6.  Spending more time with my family (and positive friends)...I can tell my boys are proud and that makes me super happy!

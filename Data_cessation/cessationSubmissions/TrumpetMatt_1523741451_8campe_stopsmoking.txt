Three and a half months or so. Cravings are getting bad as of a week or so. BAD bad. I almost smoked one today. Help?

As the title says.

I'm stressing out. It's not just the cigarette that's stressing me out. Life is kinda hard for me at the moment - master's student abroad, unemployed, no financial support, freelancing for money, not a lot of money, lots of work between school and scrambling for money. Plus some personal baggage.

Today I *almost* lit one up. I stood in front of a cigarette and talked myself out of it, twice. First one was hard, second one was *hard*. I don't know if I will be able to successfully talk myself out of smoking a cigarette three times in a single day.

Suggestions, encouragement, talking, literally discussing the weather with me to keep me occupied, any comment is welcome.

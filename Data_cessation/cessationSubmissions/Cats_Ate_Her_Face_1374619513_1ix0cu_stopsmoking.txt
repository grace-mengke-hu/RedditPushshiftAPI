This is for real this time.

I thought I had my badge removed way back when...if I hadn't started up again, I'd be at 402 days right now. That's pretty depressing.  I went 100 days my first go-around, too!

Last time I stopped smoking it was to save money, and I got a lot of replies from people here that it wasn't going to last.  Now it's not a money issue. I'm tired of having gross coughing fits. My lips are doing a weird zombie chap thing, which I'm convinced is from this recent pack of smokes.  I don't want my daughter to not have a mom because I was a dumbass.

I logically know that I don't really *like* smoking, it's just that my brain is releasing chemicals that makes me *think* I enjoy smoking.

I was all prepared to stop by the store on the way home and pick up my smokes.  I'm making a conscious decision that I'm NOT going to do that today. 



Now, I just need to get my badge changed back to the beginning and keep on keeping on.

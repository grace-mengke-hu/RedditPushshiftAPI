First day of withdrawals. 2nd say of no smoking. I feel like dying.

Jesus fuck man. smoking for nearly 10 years have been smoking damn near 2 packs a day. Feel like i got the flu, shakes, hot and cold flashes, sore throat , cough, Hawking up phlegm and some blood, insomnia, feel like crying and my whole body aches, i feel it in my joints and bones. 

What can i do? What helped y'all? Are my symptoms normal? This sucks dick man. I'm glad this subreddit is here.

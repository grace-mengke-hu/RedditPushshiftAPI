I want to be alive for the future. For my future. D-1

I got back into smoking over a year ago after vowing to quit. A good 2 year run then I relapsed in after some hard times. I shouldn't have but I did.

After breaking up with my girlfriend, losing people to multiple reasons, losing my job, whatever, I realized that while I can blame all my bad times and all the hardships I've gone through, but in the end, I chose to smoke. A decision that I myself took and one that I realized that this is not the way I want to live.

&amp;nbsp;


I don't think I'm ready yet for something like fate to come into my life but I don't think anybody ever is. 

All I do know is that I want to be around for everything.

For all my friends

For all my family

For my future wife 

and hopefully future kids

but most importantly, 

myself.

&amp;nbsp;


Wish me luck, **Day-1** and I'm determined. 

It's time for me to change where I stand in life and get better.

NRT patch question

I am wondering about others experiences reducing the patch dosage. I am almost at the end of the 2 weeks of step one (highest dose) and I have one week of step two and one week of step three.

The box says I should do two weeks of step two and two weeks of step three.

For those who have used the patch, what are your thoughts?

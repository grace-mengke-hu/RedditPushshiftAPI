changing tastes

so i’m midway through day 2 (2 days &amp; 17 hrs!) and decided to treat myself to my favorite caramel macchiato from starbucks. it’s possible it was a new barista but do tastes change so quickly? the caramel just seems so.. bitter to me today. i’ve been drinking homemade coffee since i quit so i definitely think caramel and i are no longer friends. what foods have you had to break up with or adjust since quitting?

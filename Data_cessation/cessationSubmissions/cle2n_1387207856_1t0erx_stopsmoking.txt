Spliffs

FUCK. I was going so strong. Christmas day was going to be 2 months for me... but I broke this weekend and smoked one spliff on saturday, and then another on sunday (last night). I know this doesn't mean it's all over... just a couple steps in the wrong direction. But I have been beating myself up about it all morning and posting here usually helps. I just feel weak and stupid.

I am finally a non-smoker, 100 days smoke free!!

Today I will be reaching my one hundred days of quitting smoking and thought I would post here after such a mile stone. I finally feel like a non-smoker and it feels amazing. I want to thank all of you guys for your support during the process of me quitting and I want to say what a great community this is! Thank you very much! After five years of smoking, I could not be any happier. My advice is, quit while you can. Also it felt great bringing a friend down with me, our quit dates are only a few days apart and he will be reaching one hundred soon :). Let me know if you have any questions.

Finally to a year! I know it's cliched to quit on New Years and all...

My birthday happens to be in the first part of January, so I wanted to at least quit before my birthday, hence January first of 2012. 

To everyone who jut quit or is choosing to quit this year, it is definitely possible to do without going crazy! I know for me cigarettes used to be an outlet and a way to escape momentarily from my problems, but after a year I've found healthier alternatives in running, writing and painting. :) 

I run my first half marathon later this month! Never thought I would be able to say that! Thank you to everyone here-- you were an inspiration when I needed it most.

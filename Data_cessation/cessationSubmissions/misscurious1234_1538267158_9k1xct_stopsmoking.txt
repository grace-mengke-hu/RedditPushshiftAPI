30 days - there is never a good time to quit, so it might as well be now

When I decided to quit smoking, when I was FINALLY ready, it was because I was feeling ill. My age and health were deteriorating (a pack a day for 35 years will do that) and I wanted to do everything I could to be at my healthiest before I turned 50. 

Little did I know that as part of my get healthy program, I would be brought to my knees by a routine medical exam.  For the past two weeks I have been dealing with my new medical reality/future, all without my primary adult life coping mechanism - smoking.  No one, not me, my family, or my doctor expected this (not a smoking related illness). 

I’ve hated it. My first thought when I got the diagnosis- I need a smoke.  Fuck!  I don’t do that anymore, what now?  

Now, I break down sobbing while I shower.  I’m a basket case at times due to medication side effects, and that’s on top of the emotional upheaval and lifestyle changes that naturally accompany quitting smoking.  I swear, if a chest x-ray shows I have lung cancer, I will completely lose my shit!

On the flip side, I’m not furiously looking at my watch, wondering when I can sneak outside (of the doctor’s, the house, at work) for a smoke.  I don’t stink of cigarettes anymore!  When I feel that itch in my lungs that I want to satiate with cigarette smoke, I take multiple deep breathes to calm my nerves. Smoke isn’t required (I never knew this - I never tried). 

Quitting smoking isn’t easy. It doesn’t always look pretty.  There is no perfect time to quit. When you are ready, you will quit regardless of what life throws out at you - good or bad. 

I don’t smoke anymore, no matter what!

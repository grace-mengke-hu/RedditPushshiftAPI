I just bought a pack after beeing clean for two+ years

I was gonna buy some weed so i went to the store and bought a pack of marlboro gold, but the guy canceled on me.

Now i am just sitting here smoking, i use to smoke like a pack and a half a day for 7 years.

I quit cold turkey and this is my first slip up, and now im kind of looking for someone to tell me its ok to smoke this entire pack and that i wont relapse.

I quit because i was short on money i still am, but i gained like 20 kilos during these two years and i will feel like shit if that was all for waste.

I feel like i wont slip up and its ok if its just this one pack.
Tell me i am wrong :((((((

Edit 1
I am better then this, this is just a minor set back.

Back at day 1 but that is ok :D 

I dont usually smoke weed i just felt kinda down these last couple of days, but now i feel even worse :(

Gonna tell the guy not to bother im not gonna relapse again i am better then this.

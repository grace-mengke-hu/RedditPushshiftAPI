Day one again.

I know there are a million of these posts, but still. My lungs are already mad at me. Shit. I lost count of how many last cigarettes I've had. This part is always weird, right after I decide to quit again, but before the cravings set in. I already know what to expect, I just have to get back in the saddle. Ugh.

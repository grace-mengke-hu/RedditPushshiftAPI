I quit right now. Need an advice.

Hi guys. I decided to quit now. I was smoking for 5 + years on and off. And today I just decided that I have enough.
One thing that scares me out, is that some of my colleagues are smokers, and we used to smoke together a lot. All of my previous tries of quitting ended up at some point, when I saw one of my colleagues going out to smoke on the balcony, and have suddenly decided to join. I am afraid, I'll do it again.

How should I behave in the situations? 
I will be very grateful for any advice or experience, shared in this thread.

Thank You for the support.

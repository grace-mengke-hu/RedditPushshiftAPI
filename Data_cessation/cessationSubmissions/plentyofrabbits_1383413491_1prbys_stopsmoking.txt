Day One...here goes nothing!

Hello /r/stopsmoking!

Today's the day I quit smoking! 

I've been on Chantix for a week now and today's "cold turkey" day. So far, it feels a bit easier than times in the past. 

I haven't had really *any* of the negative side effects of Chantix...some insomnia and very vivid dreams, but no nightmares. 

Any advice or things to look out for? My husband's going to be out all day today and we'll keep busy with chores tomorrow.

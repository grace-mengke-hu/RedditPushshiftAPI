Things we do to feed the monster

I live in California and I wear a N95 mask every day to protect my lungs. The air is grey and awful. And I see people smoke cigarettes on the streets. A friend of mine posted a long piece of info on air filters she has in her house and how important the clean air is for her health... she is a smoker! Oh the irony

I go through similar examples in my memories. Me smoking in the rain, saving the precious cigarette from the moisture. Shivering on the balcony in the midst of brutal Russian winter, holding a cigarette with my blue stiff fingers. Smoking while having strep, and so on. Trying to smoke during a dust storm in a desert. Cuz I neeeeded toooo. All me. 

Nicotine is a mighty beast. It makes us bend over backwards and do truly awful things to ourselves. 

I wish everyone who is reading this and struggling to be free from it. My heart really goes to everyone who is smoking right now.

Not a single cigarette smoked in May! Harrumble!

I quit smoking on April 20th (420 lol kind of ironic) and June is less than an hour away.  Obviously I won't be running to the store tonight so I can say that I've been smoke-free for an entire calender month!  

My total 41 day streak isn't much, compared to what a lot of you have accomplished, but I'm still surprised and very proud of myself.  If it weren't for the tips, tricks, and recommendations from y'all at /r/stopsmoking, I most likely would've relapsed by now, so thanks a million!

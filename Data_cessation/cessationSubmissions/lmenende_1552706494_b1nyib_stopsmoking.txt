70 days quit and still feel lost

Smoked for 32 years. Tried to quit many times and finally quit! I feel like I will never go back but I feel lost as a person. I feel lost, depressed, anxious, and just not myself. I feel having conversations is a struggle. I don’t want to do anything or go anywhere. I should be happy that I am not smoking! I have lost part of my identity. It is so odd. Having trouble pulling myself up and I think my husband wants to strangle me. He says fun Lisa is gone but he is ecstatic that I don’t smoke any more. I posted about this at 50 days and I received some great responses. I just need to hear that I am not abnormal and others are going through this and if someone has gone through this that there is a light at the end of the tunnel. Does anyone know of a free counseling site that can help with this?

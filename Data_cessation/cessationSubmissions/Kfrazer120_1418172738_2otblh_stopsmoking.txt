I need tips!!

Okay so I'm new to Reddit and I've decided I want to quit smoking, I've smoked since I was very young and considering I'm only 19 that makes it even worse in my mind, I want to quit because I want to be more healthy, I can't exactly afford it and I can see it annoys people I'm close with. Also I wouldn't smoke a full pack in one day but if I drink on a Night out I can smoke a full pack, otherwise I try limit myself to 3/4 a day. 
I do have an e cig but I find it isn't the same sensation, has anyone any suggestions, tips or just anything to help me. Please!!

Mother in Law has quit after 50 years and having a very rough time.

I am day 19 after 25 years of smoking about a pack and a half a day.

My mother-in-law also quit (although we never talked about doing a "quit" at the same time).  She has been nicotine free for about 2 weeks.

She smoked Marlboro Reds for about 50 years and is currently 70 years old.  She has battled CPOD and emphysema recently and seems committed to being done with this habit.

The problem is she feels like the wheels are coming off.  She has crying jags and gets very emotional for no apparent reason.  She feels like she is "losing it" - in her words.

The doctor has prescribed her diazepam (anti-anxiety) for a few years after her husband passed away from ALS.  Apparently that medication is not helping much with these current emotional episodes.

She says she thought she would miss the lighting of the cigarette and taking a drag but surprisingly doesn't.  She just feels like she's going crazy.  

Nicotine patch made her very nauseous and she refuses to use them now.

I really need some help/advice on what to do for her.  She is old school so places like this subreddit won't appeal to her.

Her doctor seems to be the "just suck it up and you'll be okay" kind of guy.

Her symptoms appear to be getting WORSE since she quit a few weeks ago.  

I'll answer any questions I can if I have missed something you all need to know.

Thanks in advance...

I feel that the cravings are gone, but I can't focus on anything...

I have not smoked for 146 days and I feel great, but right now I'm trying to focus on some school work I have to do and I'm feeling like if I just smoked one cigarette I will totally be able to finish.

I have been able to cope with the cravings, but right now I feel like I can't focus without nicotine. Any recommendations?

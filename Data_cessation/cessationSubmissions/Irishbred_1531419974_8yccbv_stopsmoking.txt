UGHHHH....

Wow! 18/19 days in and I feel like I am hitting a wall, my mind is telling me one thing and my "other mind" is saying fuck off!! I like my other mind!! I think i will mow the lawn, I have to do something here because this is as low or as close to giving in as i have been. I hate it!!! I will not give in!!!

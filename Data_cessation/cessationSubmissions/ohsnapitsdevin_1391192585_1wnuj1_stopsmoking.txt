Today is (hopefully) a new day.

Yesterday, AskReddit had a wonderful question about how to stop smoking for good, which led me to this subreddit. After some small talk with my boyfriend, we both decided that yesterday was our last day smoking and today we would quit. He's currently reading Allen Carr's book and I am have a lot of support from my roommates, so fingers crossed that this will finally be the end. 

Thank you guys for existing, you gave us the strength to even try!

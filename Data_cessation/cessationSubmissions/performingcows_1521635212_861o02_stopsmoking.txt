First day! What to expect, recovery time?

I just quit (13 hours ago, a lot of that spent sleeping), so for now i'm feeling motivated and haven't had cravings yet. I told everyone, fianc√©e, roommates etc. that I am quitting, so I'm really planning to see this through. I was wondering if there's differences in how long cravings or even just thinking about cigarettes keeps happening, depending on for how long someone smoked? I was a smoker for two years, will that make recovery from the addiction any easier or quicker?

How marijuana got rid of my 15 year, pack and a half/ day habit.

Background: Pack and half (roughly, more closer to two) 

Was with some buddies and we planned on smoking some weed then grabbing dinner. We smoke, chill for a little whatever. then, we start driving and this song ‘There He Go’ - SchoolBoyQ came on and i for whatever reason, just hated my habit. Had my pack of smokes with me and threw it out of the window (Yes i know terrible on me for littering) and felt so free instantly. 

It’s been 9 days and i’ve never felt better

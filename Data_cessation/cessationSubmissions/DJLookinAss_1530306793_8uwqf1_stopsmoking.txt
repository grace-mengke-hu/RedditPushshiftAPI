Just reached two weeks without a cigarette, but I’m frustrated.

I hit two weeks exactly today, and while I’m proud of myself, I’m a bit disappointed and frustrated. Partially, I’m mad. I’ve sporadically been using an electronic cigarette, and feel guilty every single time. I went 3 days without it, then caved. Went another 4, then caved.
What is wrong with me? The worst was over each of those times, and I essentially just restarted the process each time, prolonging my addiction. At first, the e-cig was very helpful, at least for the first 2 days. 
But more than anything, I’m just a bit angry and frustrated. I’m done with the e cig and nicotine in general. 
I know using an e cig does work from some people, but I can’t delude myself into believing I’d ever be able to wean myself from it. 
I’ve got to cut it out once and for all, and I’m starting right now. 

(Apologies that most of my activity in here is ranting, but it’s therapeutic in a way :p)

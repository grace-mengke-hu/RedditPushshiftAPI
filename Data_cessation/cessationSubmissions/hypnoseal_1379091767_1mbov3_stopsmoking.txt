I need vacation tips

I am heading out for an extended vacation to countries which have a wide variety and very easy access to smokes.  It is a huge concern of mine that I will slip up during the trip and say or think  "What the heck, I'm on vacation.", or not think clearly when drinking or just being dumb about smoking.  I've already told myself, if I can make it through the whole vacation without smoking I'll be much stronger and better at my resolve to quit.  I'll tell the friends I'm travelling with to help me out and I'll try my hardest to not buy any smokes.


Can anyone provide me some tips to help keep me on the wagon during my trip?  I plan on bringing a bunch of Nicorette gums to help battle cravings, but I already know that plan isn't popular around here.  Please help!

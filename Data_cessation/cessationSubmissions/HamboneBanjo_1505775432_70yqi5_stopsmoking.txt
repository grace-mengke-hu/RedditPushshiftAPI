Noticing a difference

Okay, so, I'm creeping up on 40 years of age. But I don't let my age dictate what I do. I'm pretty active in general, even when I was smoking. I've now been off nicotine entirely for a few hours shy of two weeks. This past weekend my wife, my nephew (28), and I were doing some fairly intense yard work. I had already mowed and pulled a bunch of weeds and I got to a point where I usually feel winded, so I started to take a break. My nephew, who still smokes, was crashing and burning but I was still raring to go. My body was getting a little tired, but my lungs and heart felt fresh. I honestly don't remember feeling this physically capable since I was training with the military. This is ridiculously awesome. 

Thank you all for being so gracious and supportive. You have really helped me a lot!

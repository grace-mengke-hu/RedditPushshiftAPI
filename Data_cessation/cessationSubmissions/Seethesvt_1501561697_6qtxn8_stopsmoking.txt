250+ days cold turkey

I have resisted every urge, and I will continue to do so. If I cave just once I know I'll start again. I do not want to smoke at all. 

I still nic out, like I am right now, but that has become rare. I love not smoking. I love every part of being in control of what I do after I eat, or after I wake up. I love not having to pause a movie for a smoke break. I love that my wife doesn't tell me I stink anymore. 

My breath is better, it's easier to breath deeply. Fuck smoking. Never again. Not even once. Making it a year isn't even a question.

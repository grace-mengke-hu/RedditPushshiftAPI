Half a year cig-free...I made it :)

I've been going through a hard time emotionally lately, and I started vaping again...But I've had plenty of opportunities to buy a pack or bum a cigarette from someone in the past 6 months,and I've told myself no. At this point, I don't get intense cravings. Hell, the only time I ever feel like I might miss them is when someone near me is smoking. Even then, the urge isn't stronger than my desire to live healthier, and not let cigs rule my life. So even though I've felt like I haven't been doing that great lately, this is an accomplishment that encourages me!

Not today satan

So, it's been over a month since I quit. Yesterday, while at the beach, I was looking around behind my seat in my truck for sunblock and....I put my hand on a brand new pack of camel blues, I must have lost it back there. I sat there staring at it for what seemed like an eternity, but was probably like 30 seconds. I put it down on the seat and went to enjoy the beach for a couple hours. I stopped to get gas on my way home and left the pack in the ashtray outside a 7-11. I'm really fucking proud of myself. I wasn't really having the best day mentally, thinking about a recent breakup and feeling kinda worthless, going to the beach to stare at the water and feel sorry for myself usually makes me feel better. To resist a smoke in that state of mind really proved something to myself. I can and will do this.

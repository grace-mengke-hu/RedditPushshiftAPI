12 Days without smoking and anxiety

Hi, I have tried smoking again and again but this time I feel fully determined. It's been 12 days and my cravings have really come down. I stopped smoking because I have had anxiety issues since last couple of months. I started thinking that I will go out of breath and if I continue smoking. The fear of breathing was devastating. It hindered with my daily routine activities. It's been 9 years I am smoking mostly pack a day. The fear of breathing is less now but the fear of catching a cancerous disease because of the deeds done in past is haunting me. Can someone help me with this anxiety.

I had the most terrible dream last night

So I bought an e-cig a few months ago. Still continued to smoke for about two months (dumb). About one month ago I stopped buying packs. Except, I still bum a cig like, once every 4-5 days (dumb). 

Last night I had a horrible dream that my teeth were rotting away from smoking and I was literally pulling rotten teeth out of my mouth.

So today, I'm done completely. No more bumming from friends. I will still continue to smoke my e-cig on 12mg, and then wean myself off. 

Every time I bum a cig from someone, I feel horrible about it afterwards. Yet I continue to do it.. Not anymore!

Smoking, weight loss, depression.. help!

Last year I was smoking a pack a day, and was quite overweight too. I decided to lose weight first, quit smoking afterwards.

I lost 40 kg (70~ lbs), using smoking as a distraction I suppose. At the beginning of this year, I quit smoking.

Recently, due to medical issues and medication, I have gained half the weight I lost back again. And with problems binge eating, am finding it impossible to lose weight and stay off the smokes. (Cravings are back).

I guess my question is.. do I start smoking again for a few months to lose weight again? Try and stay at half a pack or less a day while I get my weight on track? Do I try and tough it out? I know this is a quit-smoking forum, but I'm not sure whether smoking or weight gain is more of a problem. My psychiatrist thought losing weight first is better than quitting smoking (for self-image related depression I guess).

But 6 months of not smoking has me really sad if I started again.... wtffff! Help!

I went from 100 to 0 real quick and now started craving something more.

Hey guys, 

So my stop smoking technique was: throw away anything smoking related and just not think about it.

This worked really great until a week or 2 ago. I think about smoking every single day, not all day, but yet every day.
It's getting to the point that it's so annoying that I just want to give in or something.

I talked about it with my SO and we talked about me getting a vaporizer to replace something that's missing for me. 

Is it smart for me to start vaping when I'm already 5+ months in to stopping with smoking?

You guys helped me out in the past and I would love to hear your opinions on this.

Thanks in advance.

Day 75 -- Faced a really big trigger for the first time as a nonsmoker, and.....

...didn't smoke! Not even tempted, though I still do love the smell of 2nd hand smoke.

Went to a pool party, (it's been scorching in LA the past 3 days, sorry east coast peeps) went swimming, had food, drinks, and sat in the sun with people chain smoking!!!

I'll go ahead and say it, I am so proud of myself. Wouldn't be here without the support of all the amazing people here, and Allen Carr's genius book and video.

Keep it up guys, it's really only as difficult as we make it -- which means it really can be pretty darn easy :-)

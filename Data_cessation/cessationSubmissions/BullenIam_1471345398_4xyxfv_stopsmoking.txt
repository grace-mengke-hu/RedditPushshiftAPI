I messed up

So at work about 10 minutes ago I was stressed and bored (due to a lack of work at the moment) and someone asked me am I going for a cig with her, and so she gave me one. I had gone about 10 days at this point and I regretted it instantly. But I liked it. I'm 18 coming on 19 and have been smoking for like 2 years. Any advice to resist the urge and not let this happe. Again?

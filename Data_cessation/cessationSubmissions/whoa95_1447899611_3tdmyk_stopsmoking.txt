Commitment

(My first ever post on reddit yay!)
I kind of quit two days ago, its been about 55 hours. I say kind of because I never intended on quitting completely but at the same time, a part of me wants to.
I guess the problem I'm having is commitment: the longer I don't smoke, the more I'll have to lose and I just end up thinking it'd be best if I just gave up now.
Anyone else have similar experiences?

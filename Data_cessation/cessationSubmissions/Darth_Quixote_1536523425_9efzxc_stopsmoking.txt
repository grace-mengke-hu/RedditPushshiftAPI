As luck would have it

As luck would have it (if you can call getting strep throat *lucky*), I came down with a 104 degree fever the day I planned to kick the nicotine. My esophagus felt like it was playing host to Hell's house-warming party, and so cravings, withdrawals, and all other addictive thoughts were backseat to just trying to cope with illness.  


My fever finally broke this morning, about 4 days after my last cigarette. "Wow," I thought. "I guess I quit. Huh."   


I sat outside to enjoy the fresh air in my slightly-renewed lungs when I absent-mindedly reached for the pack on my patio table, still somehow self-congratulating. I grabbed my lighter, paying no attention to what should have been alarm bells. I flipped the lid just as I heard a tiny voice whispering, "this isn't a good idea."  


As luck would have it, it'd rained some time during my 4-day coma. My cigarettes were soaked.  


That's when I realized the sickness had prevented me from mentally tempering myself against my old patterns... I don't need luck, now. I need resolve. It's so easy to convince yourself you don't see the red flags... Stay strong, friends.

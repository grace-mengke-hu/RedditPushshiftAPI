Smoking in dreams

Is anyone else's dream self still a smoker? I'm rounding the corner on 5 months on what's been my longest and most successful quit to date. I really feel like it's stuck, but about once every few weeks I'll have a dream where I smoke not just one but multiple cigarettes. It'll be secondary to whatever is going on in the dream, like I'm driving somewhere and light one up, and I'll acknowledge that I shouldn't be smoking it because I quit, but then I reason with myself and smoke it anyways. I'll wake up and be confused on whether or not it was real and feel really disappointed in myself until I realize that it was only a dream.

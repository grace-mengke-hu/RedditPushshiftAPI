Please help! Trying to keep it up!

This is my second day not smoking. I have been a smoker for about 7 years now... holy fuck I cant believe its been that long. I really need to quit for good as I am starting to notice side effects like coughing and weezing. This is my second day and I am afraid I will relapse. Any advice would be great!

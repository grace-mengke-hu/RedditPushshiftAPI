One week down! And convinced others to quit too!

Haven't touched a cigarette in a week and I couldn't be more proud of myself. Even so, this weekend was the hardest by far and more than once I almost gave in. I even almost considered going to buy some 'herbal cigarettes' since I've come to the conclusion that I miss the act of smoking more than the actual cigarettes. But just popping a piece of gum and distracting myself with something else made the craving much easier to deal with.
 
One of my roommates also decided to quit and he's now on day 5 with no cigarettes. His first few days were really hard, but he seems to be over the hump now and I have no doubts he'll be fine. My other roommate is having a harder time, but did go 24 hours without one before he bought a pack -- he's not really convinced he wants to quit though. He'll quit when he's ready.
 
One thing that I plan on doing to encourage myself (and also my second roommate) to keep it up is to open a savings account and deposit the money I WOULD have spent on cigarettes into the account instead. So far this past week I saved almost $25 and didn't smoke 95 cigarettes that I would have otherwise smoked. That comes out to $1200 a year that I have to spend on other things and almost 5000 cigarettes that I won't smoke every year. That's crazy...

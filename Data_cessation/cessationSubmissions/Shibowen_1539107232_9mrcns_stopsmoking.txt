Glad to be back

You know what it's like to relapse into the smoking habit but still subscribed to this subreddit? 

It's unpleasant, having to divert your attention away from the new posts that get to your front page.

Anyway. I'm three days without a smoke and it was pretty easy. Couldn't stand the headaches, the absolute waste of money, the worse hangovers, the paranoia of long-term disease... yeah, I'm glad to be back to not smoking.

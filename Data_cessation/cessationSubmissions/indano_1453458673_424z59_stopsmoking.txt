Smoke-free for a whole year!

What can I say?! I have been looking forward to this particular post for, well, a whole year!  I feel accomplished, healthy, happy, guilt-free and I am no longer reluctant to make future plans. I started running last summer and ran my first race in December. I truly feel confident that I will never smoke again. 

Thank you everyone in this subreddit for being you. This place is amazing. This sense of accomplishment eclipses any drug-induced feeling! Have a great day everyone. I am treating myself to a fancy dinner!

just a day 17 update.

I quit 16.5 days ago.  I used an e-cig and gum for most of that.  Iam off the e-cig and just doing gum and it's been pretty good so far.  I have been using the 4mg gum, but will be stepping down to the 2mg gum in the next few days (as soon as the 4mg is done) Just wanted to check in and say im almost free. feels good.

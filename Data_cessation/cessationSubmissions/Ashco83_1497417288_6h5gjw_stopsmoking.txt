Struggling

I was a smoker for 20 years, started when I was 13. I quit in March. I've been doing really well, and haven't really had many cravings, until recently. It started about 2 days ago and smoking weed isn't really helping like it usually does.
 I know why the sudden cravings- increased stress. My dog is having surgery tomorrow. She has cancer and it fucking blows. Between the diagnosis, suggested treatment, financial strain and trying to plan for recovery my stress is through the roof and all I want is a disgusting,nasty,smelly cigarette.
 Ugh, this sucks! Any suggestions?
Edit: I have some patches and left over lozenges, but don't want to reintroduce nicotine to my system.

I quit smoking 5 years ago, thought I would share my story.

**Disclaimer:** I am not a doctor, nor a psychologist, nor a lawyer, nutritionist, priest, monk, gymnast, firefighter, or any kind of expert. I'm just a guy and this is my story.  
  
Ignoring a couple of innocent puffs when I was 9 or 10, **I started smoking** when I was 14 years old. It was mostly out of peer pressure, but I didn't realize it then. And boredom. A lot of it was boredom.  
At first it was kind of exciting, the risk of getting in trouble with my mom or the teachers at school. That was kind of the point. It was a part of the whole "stick it to the man" thing which comes along with puberty.  
I don't really know why I continued to smoke after all the excitement of it passed. It kind of became a part of me. it was hard to imagine myself without smokes. Whenever I left the house, I would check my right pocket for my keys and cellphone, and my left pocket for a pack of smokes and a lighter. Eating lunch would seem unnatural without smoking afterwards, and walking to school would feel like a chore unless there was a friendly smoke in my hand to keep me company.  
And I didn't just keep smoking. I was very passionate about it. Looking back I did a lot of stupid things just to get a smoke. There was the usual stuff like like stepping out into the cold and rain just to get a few puffs. There was the stuff I could rationalize and was kind of normal for a smoker like using your lunch money to buy smokes. And then there was the really stupid shit, like smoking random butts off the ground. Hell, I even once smoked a cigarette someone vomited on just because there was nothing else. I regularly stole smokes from others if I hadn't any, and when I would get drunk I'd become a master at bumming smokes. Once I bummed more than a pack and a half of smokes on a 30 min walk home just to see how much I could get. A couple of times when I was out of smokes, I tried smoking blueberry tea. It was actually tasty but it made me cough like hell and it was difficult to get it burning. One time I even tore up some toilet paper, rolled it into some smoking papers, and smoked it. I don't even know how that was supposed to make any sense.  
And there were a lot of other things I did that I'm not proud of just to get a smoke, and I still kept on doing it.  
  
**In a certain way I was always trying to quit.** The deadline was when I get kids, "I'll definitely quit then, it wouldn't be fair to them" I used to say.  
I tried everything I could think of to quit smoking. The first thing, of course, was going cold turkey, that would work for anywhere from 5 minutes to lets say maybe a week, but It never stuck. Same thing with everything else. Going one smoke less per day, or switching to a lighter brand. Hiding smokes away from me in hard to reach places, not buying my own, only taking from others (you can imagine how excited my friends were about this one). Only smoking after lunch or sex, and in the morning and evening. Only on weekends, only on weekdays, only every other day, only when alone, only in company, only at home. Smoking only as a reward if I did something good (this ended up just being an exercise in fooling myself that everything I did was good: "I managed to go to the store and not fuck anything up, woop for me, time for a reward"). Promising everyone I will quit, letting everybody know I had quit, smoking in secret, smoking only half a smoke, smoking only two cigarettes at once (I have no idea how this made any sense), and a bunch of other things.  
The only thing they all had in common is that they all failed.  
They failed because even when I wasn't actually smoking any cigarettes I was still thinking as a smoker, waiting for the need for a smoke to go away, but it never did. Not until I finally gave up and lit one up, and that made me feel like shit.  
  
It was really hard to pick up after every failed attempt and get ready for another round, and sometimes I thought I had given up, that the day I would finally quit will be the day I die, or maybe even a little after that.  
But with time, this feeling of despair would pass, and I'd get ready to step into the ring once again, over and over again, for eight long years.  
  
For the couple of months right before I finally quit I got up to two and a half packs a day.  
  
  
**A friend of mine gave me a book,** it was "The easy way to stop smoking" by Allen Carr, and I would recommend it to anyone trying to quit. A lot of people I know and people all over the interwebs quit the day they read the book, and never look back.  
I was not planning on trying to quit around that time, but I started reading it one evening, just out of curiosity, and ended up staying awake all night, reading it through in one sitting, chain smoking while I did it. After the book was finished, I lit up once again, just to say goodbye to all the little things I liked about smoking, and then I was cured.  
It sounds like complete and total bullshit now that I think about it, but that's what happened. A miracle you could say, and in a way it was, in that "too good to be true" kind of way, because I started again 6 months later.  
  
But **for six months I was free.** And I don't mean, suffering through withdrawal and dreaming about smokes, but really really free. No jealous looks at other smokers, or sticking an unlit smoke in between my lips just to see how it feels, or buying a pack and then staring at it for half an hour before throwing it out, absolutely no side effects. Well, at least no negative ones.  
  
The first day after quitting was Monday and, as spring was just starting, I decided that I was going to ride my bicycle to work the whole week, come what may.  
I still remember the feeling of despair I had on the first ride over. After just a couple of minutes of riding, I was out of breath, my legs were on fire, my ass hurt like hell, and most of my mental energy was focused on cursing this metal contraption. I felt incredibly stupid for thinking that this was a good idea. It took me more than half an hour to get there and I was, in a way, ashamed to lock up my bike next the other bikes, as somehow I didn't feel I deserved it.  
By the time Friday came along, I had gone to work by bike every day, and by now, I could get there in 20 minutes, enjoying my ride over, not even breaking a sweat or feeling out of breath, not thinking about anything in particular, just letting my mind wander wherever it wanted to.  
It was, and still is, a kind of meditative experience, a calm before the storm, preparing me for the difficult day ahead.  
  
I used this opportunity to change some of the other stuff I didn't like about my life. I decided to be more physically active, that I would try to eat more healthy food, get my sleep schedule sorted out, and other similar stuff people do when they try the whole "I'm becoming a better person" thing.  
  
With **the changes** I expected, like breathing more easily, or not having to spend 5 minutes each morning cleaning my throat and nose of snot, came other changes, not so obvious ones.  
The pain in my back that had been bothering me for a while went away. My skin suddenly cleared up of all the little zits and spots I had from time to time. My nails got stronger and healthier. I stopped feeling lightheaded after standing up fast, and getting up in the morning got a lot easier, so did falling asleep. Food started to taste better, not a lot, but noticeably, and the sex got better. not just because I had more energy but the orgasms started to feel different, stronger. My posture changed, I started to stand more upright, less slouched. I became noticeably less cynical and got a huge boost of self esteem, also I found it was a lot easier to concentrate and get things done.  
After a while I did gain some weight. I'm 1.88 m (6'2) and I went from about 75 kg (165 lb) to 80 kg (175 lb). This was expected as I started to eat a lot more, but people would tell me I actually looked more fit, and I felt great. Later I talked to a friend and he said that what might have happened was that I actually gained mostly muscle. This made sense not only because I was riding my bike a lot, but I also noticed that whatever I would be doing I would be doing it with a spring in my step so to speak. If I needed to go to the fridge to get something I would not drag my body as a sack of potatoes like I used to, I'd rather jump up, maybe do like a half running thing, or even do a little dance on my way there (If no one was around of course). I'd go up stairs two by two again, used to do that as a kid, and I'd find myself running to catch that tram that I would have used to let get away.  
All this did not take any effort on my part, at first I didn't even notice it, only after people started pointing it out did It catch my attention. But I guess since I had a lot more energy it had to go somewhere, and as silly as these little things sound they did add up.   
  
**None of this was really that surprising,** and I even kind of expected it since I have read a lot about what people say when they quit, but on the other hand, some things did surprise me.  
Where I live we have an above ground tram system, kind of like San Francisco but without the hills, and one day I was riding a tram to work or somewhere, and suddenly I smelled flowers. Now any smoker knows that this only happens either if there is a flower up your nose, or when a very perfumed up person walks by. But to my surprise, there were no flowers attacking my face, and there was no one around me. Except a really sweaty looking guy and a couple of kids there was no one else in the tram.  
The tram was stopped at a station and the doors were open. It was a clear sunny day in the middle of spring and a light breeze was stirring an otherwise pretty warm afternoon.  
As my mind darted around in panic trying to figure out the source of the scent, "A brain tumor perhaps?", suddenly my gaze fell on a bush across the street. An entire sidewalk, a tram station and four lanes of traffic separated me from the bush, but the warm aroma of its bright yellow flowers somehow found it's way to my nose, and by now my sense of smell had recovered enough to be sensitive to such a gentle fragrance.  
Suddenly a thought burst in my mind eclipsing all others. It presented itself as a memory, but a strange one. Mine, but somehow unfamiliar, as though I had forgotten I had it. It was a image of my grandfather as he was standing by a similar yellow flowered bush at the place my family used to vacation at, in the countryside. He was explaining to a 5 or 6 year old me how to properly clip branches.  
My grandfather passed away when I was ten, and as I grew up without a father he was the closest thing to a dad I ever had. Up to this day my memory of him still represents the greatest part of what I consider a man is supposed to be.  
This strange memory was accompanied by a strong feeling of the incredible sense of awe I had towards him, as a teacher and parent, and it shocked me that I could have forgotten a part of something so important to me.  
  
Later I did some research, and it turns out that smell is linked a lot to long term memory. There have been cases of people who lost their smell due to medical problems. After a while a lot of them report having trouble remembering things from their past, and losing a sense of self as the loss of memory starts to get significant. In some cases this caused depression and even attempts at suicide.  
It was very surprising to me that something that seemed so trivial as the loss of smell could lead someone into taking their own life, but after experiencing a hint of that on my own, in a way I could understand it.  
  
I wondered what other memories have gone up in smoke, and up until this day, although not nearly as often, I get surprised by strange and exciting scents, uncovering parts of my past I have forgotten I had.  
  
If I tried to list all the ways **my life got better** for the 6 months I was free, it would fail because it would be impossible to remember everything. But I do know that shortly after I quit, almost all of the problems I had in life were either gone immediately or suddenly did not seem that important or difficult to overcome.  
Some, or maybe even most of this was caused by other things, such as being more physically active or other changes that came around that time, but that was kind of the point. There was absolutely no way that I could have made those changes if I had continued to smoke, and once that was out of the way, and I accepted that my life is going to undergo a big change, everything else just kind of fell into place.  
Of course, later, other problems appeared as the devil does not sleep. But they were different, deeper problems, things that would be hard to notice and come to terms with had I not changed. It was one of those "not seeing the forest for the trees" kind of thing, my smoking addiction being a giant redwood, casting its shadow over everything else.  
  
If you would ask me **why did it work** I'd have to tell that I have no Idea. There was a lot of what I would consider to be bullshit in the book, but then again a lot of it made sense.  
Mostly it made me realize that there are things about smoking I thought I knew, which were actually wrong. It's really really hard to admit to yourself that something you KNOW to be true is wrong. That was half of the work right there.  
  
After 6 months of being a non-smoker **I started again**, but this time it was different. I was going into it with no preconceptions. During these 6 months I did a lot of things to try to see how smoking really affected me. I did not smoke a pack a day constantly, it was more on and off, with breaks for a couple of days. Some weeks I smoked more than a pack, even two. Mostly I would smoke If I really felt like it, not just because half an hour had past since my last smoke so "it was time".  
The most important thing I did was that I stopped smoking automatically. Every time before I would light up I'd take a couple of seconds to try and get a sense of how I was feeling at the time. It turns out that for most days, unless there is something obvious going on, this is a lot harder than it seems. But with time I learned how to figure out if I was slightly irritated or jolly or bored or whatever.  
If I was alone or if it was ok to do, I'd drop what I was doing, and really focus on the smoking and how my mood changed as I would smoke. This too was hard at first, and mostly there would be really no change or the only thing I could feel was a familiar sense of relief that came from satisfying my addiction. But as the weeks and months passed it became easier to notice the effects smokes had on me, and sometimes the effects would be so dramatic they were really hard to ignore.

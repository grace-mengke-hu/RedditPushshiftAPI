What stores don’t usually card you for nicotine gum

I’m underage and want to quit, I went to Rite Aid today and got two packs of gum. They asked for my card, said I didn’t have it and they let me slide but they said next time I have to have it. Are there any stores that don’t really give a shit and will just sell you it without carding you. I don’t want my family to ever know that I smoked so I’m not gonna ask them to help me get it

5 Days Cold Turkey

I am new to this page as well as reddit. I use the smoke free app and can see, some of you all do as well! I quit, cold turkey, literally decided I was done and threw away over half a pack of cigarettes, 5 days ago. I have smoked for 9 years (omg!!!) I have cravings here and there, mostly after eating. I hope to receive some encouragement as well as to project some! Love some of the posts I am seeing already!!

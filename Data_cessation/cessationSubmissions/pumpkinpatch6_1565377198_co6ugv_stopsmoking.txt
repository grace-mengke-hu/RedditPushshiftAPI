My Poor Gut💨💥💨

*My rant originated in the Pokemon thread- looking for advice/similar experiences if possible:)*

My gut bacteria seem to be quite upset with me lol. I haven’t had *anything* even remotely close to “smoker’s flu”, but my god I have been farting NON.STOP. This has gone on for weeks now, they are supersized, flaming, rotten and demonic.

Google results keep telling me that smoking creates excessive gas and quitting will *lessen* it. Google results also say that farting as much as 20-30 times a day would still be considered normal range. I could probably knock that out in an hour.

I’m so glad I’m smokefree but this has got to stop! I shall continue my steady diet of maximum strength Gas-X and see about eating more yogurt lol.

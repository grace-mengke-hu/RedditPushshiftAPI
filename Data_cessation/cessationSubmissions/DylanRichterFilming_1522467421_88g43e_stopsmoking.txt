I've decided to quit today.

I'm terrified of the health effects this will have. I've only been smoking semi-heavily since December. But I know in that time I've become heavily addicted. I'll probably be frequenting here quite a bit. I feel like I just need some words of encouragement. I want to have a long healty life with my family, and I know this habit can't go on any longer. Thanks guys.

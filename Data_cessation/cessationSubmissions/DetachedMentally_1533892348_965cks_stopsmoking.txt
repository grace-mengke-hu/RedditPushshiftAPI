Thoughts on occasional smoking?

Hi.

I quit since about May 15th 2018 (after 11 years). After about 3 weeks I decided to try a cigarette while out and boozing. I had about 1 or 2 that night and didn't smoke for the next 1-3weeks, until the next time I was out. 

Since then I've smoked once every 1-2 weeks.

I haven't replaced cigarettes with food and don't think of cigarettes at all during the day. 

I'm just curious what are your thoughts on this. Is it good/better/worse &amp; why?

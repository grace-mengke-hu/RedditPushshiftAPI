Feeling sick?

I'm wondering what other people's experiences are with feeling *worse* after quitting smoking.

I've felt like I'm about to get a sore throat for about a month now, and for the last 3 weeks I've had to bail on running routines I've never had a problem with before because I get out of breath and start wheezing :(.

Everybody always seems to talk about feeling healthier etc, but I feel worse...is this normal?

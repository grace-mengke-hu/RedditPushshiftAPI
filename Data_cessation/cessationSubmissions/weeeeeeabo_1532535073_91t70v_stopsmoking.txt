I’m really jealous of all of you who are quitting.

I keep trying and relapsing over and over again. This month I went 9 days without smoking and then things got stressful at home and bam! Relapse. 
It’s so depressing to start feeling better and then relapse. I started to be able to breathe, go to the gym and even eat healthier (i.e. eat breakfast). But because I can’t handle any kind of stress, I regress to the point where I feel hopeless that I’ll even be able to quit. 

Will I ever be a non-smoker?

Relapsed, now I have quit again

I had like 43 days quit and then I relapsed and relapsed hard.  I got laid off and dumped in the same week and I kinda went off the deep end.  I went right back to 1 pack per day.  I just quit on Saturday (3/30/13) and hoping that this will be the last time.

I had to use the gum, but I haven't smoked since Friday.  Wish me luck and strength.


***Edit Update:  Still haven't smoked, that's my official quit date :)

Thanks to everyone for showing support!  This forum helps me so much.

I've done it.

I've been following this thread for a few months, waiting to gain the strength to actually quit. Finally, this week, I did it. It's been three days, but those are three BIG days, and I'm sure you all can relate. 

Day one: I was driving home from work and my car just stopped working. Out of the blue... it was 11pm and I was 20  miles away. All I thought to myself was shit... I could really use some nicotine right about now. 

Day two: I had a three hour drive to the city that I do guard drill. I'm sure you all remember how terrible car rides are, right? 

Day three: Guard Drill. This is what made me the most nervous to quit. So many of us use nicotine, but I wanted my third day to be a day at the base so I could truly test myself. And I did. 

And I passed. 

I'm here to say after a long weekend, resisting my biggest triggers, and even during drinking, guys... I've done it. I made it to my fourth day nicotine free, and I know I can do it. Not another puff, no matter what.

Take #5348 - 48 hours in

So on Sunday I smoked the last cigarette on Sunday evening around midnight.  The main motivating factor is that I moved into a new place, which is on the 3rd floor of a 3 floor building, and due to building codes where I live it does not have an elevator which means that every time I need to go out it is down 3 flights of stairs, which is not quite as bad as the 3 flights back up to the apartment.  I have found it easy to quit over the past 2 days as I have been busy unpacking and setting things up.   I plan on keeping busy even after the place is finished being setup.

Going cold turkey

That's me finally decided that I am going to quite smoking going cold turkey.  But the problem is guys?  I have another addiction other than smoking nicotine.  

For a few years now I have been smoking legal highs that I have been purchasing from my local shop.  Now can anyone please give me an idea on the the withdrawal symptoms that I could be faced with? 

Wish me luck !!!!!!!

It's been a week, but the cravings have gotten stronger...

I've had a really good week, honestly! Managed to avoid most temptations and all but the cravings have gotten so hard to manage. I went to breakfast today with a smoker. We love going to this lovely cafe and sit outside when the weather's pretty like today. So she got out her cigarettes and started smoking in front of me. 

It was so hard because she offered me one and I could honestly say I was craving it so hard and I almost said yes but I didn't and got another cup of coffee instead. 

But I swear I can taste the bitter aftertaste of coffee and cigarettes in my mouth even after hours from our coffee. It's taking everything of me to not ask my friend for one. 

How do you guys deal with this?

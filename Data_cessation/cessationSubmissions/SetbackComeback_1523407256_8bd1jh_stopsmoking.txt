Cold Turkey Eats &amp; Drinks

Hi All,

Stopped cold turkey about 10 days ago and just wanted to share a couple foods and drinks that have helped replace those initial day cravings. Full disclosure: I've also changed environments (moved), so that DEF helps me out, but figured I'd share a couple thoughts in case anyone has similar tastes/habits.

Drinks:

1. *Making* coffee -- I used to always go out and get coffee from a deli (after which I would have a smoke to start my day), so switching to making a home brew before work has helped to create a new routine while still enjoying something familiar. I might assume the opposite could be true in case you previously had your first coffee from your home pot, but I also understand that could end up being a new couple bucks per day.
2. Chicken/beef broth -- This has been a godsend in the evening. It's salty, and not that unhealthy (depends on how you are with sodium). Having a couple cups from the kettle at night has made for a new taste in my life without all the caffeine of coffee/tea. Also, kettle routine helps change things up.
3. "Sparkling Ice" flavored drinks -- This is a bit of a carryover from my cessation from alcohol, but has treated me equally well. I can have this throughout different parts of the day, and it always tastes like a treat. Bubbly sensation is a welcome new stimulus. I'm partial to the [Coconut Pineapple.]

4. Pickle Juice -- More on this in a second, but like the broth, it helps to saturate the palate and introduce a very new flavor to life. Good electrolytes too!
5. BIG water -- Water (duh) is the stuff of life. BUT, having a yuuuuge container of it at your work station during the day helps immensely. I've always found that if I've got water in front of me, I'll drink it...it's the getting up to get more water that stops me. Hence, bigger water container means more sips...more sips means helping my hand-to-mouth urge. I have [this one](https://www.amazon.com/Gallon-Reusable-Plastic-Drinking-Stainless/dp/B074GK4DWW/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1523407171&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=gallon+water+jug)...works like a charm.

Foods:

1. Pickles -- Like above, a strong flavor. Makes you feel lots of things. Personally, I think the spicier and sour-er, the better. If you've got a local pickle place, try a bunch of diff pickled goods out. I also find the vinegar taste is fairly off-putting to wanting a smoke after.
2. Hard cheeses -- You're noticing a theme with strong flavors, here. I find myself having a good chunk of parmigiano reggiano, and not want a ton more. Also, because it's hard cheese, it's slightly harder to just scarf more of it down. :)
3. Summer sausage and/or dry salami -- More strong flavors. I feel pretty full after eating only a small handful of slices. Also so yummy.

Finally, best thing about most of the things on this list, is that they don't tend to break the diet bank. In fact, much of this is considered part of the keto diet (or not far off) with high protein &amp; fat content paired with low or zero carbs.

Ok, that's all for tonight. I hope one of these works for you like it has for me. Would LOVE to hear more suggestions! Thanks for all of the continued support, gang!

Starting over

I'm turning 30 in the next couple of days... 30! 

I started smoking socially when I was about 22... then I became a heavy smoker without even realizing it. 

I quit cold turkey two years ago, and a year ago I started smoking again. 
Planning my next ten years, I want to be healthy and age well.

Quitting cold turkey. 

Wish me luck!

This time it WILL work!

A little back story, I've been smoking for almost a decade. A few years into it, I had EVERYONE tell me that I should quit. I even tried a few times here and there without succeeding. I was a half a pack a day no questions asked. I can't even begin to tell you how I was without this addiction, because I was always drawn to it even when I was younger,BUT I knew that I didn't want to become like the smokers in my family. In fact, I just had a family member pass from a cancer that is caused by smoking cigarettes. Even though she didn't smoke. Joke is on me,right? Anyway, here's me today:
My husband suggested to switch from cigarettes to vaping. (He is a non smoker, he vapes for flavors and I do occasionally) But, I don't want to substitute cigarettes for vape, I want to quit completely. I watched a video on quitting successfully. (Thanks to a fellow quitter for posting in someone else post about this video) I took a puff of a cigarette, I am READY this time! 

Now, Here's to Day 1 of healthy habits! My question is:
Have you picked up any new things that was limited from smoking and do you enjoy them more now than you would have if you smoked?

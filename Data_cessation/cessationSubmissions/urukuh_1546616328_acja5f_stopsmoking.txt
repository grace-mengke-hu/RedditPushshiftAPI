Day 16: family suck nuggets

Having a moment here. Husband has been smoking a Jule or whatever in the house and my family is till smoking cigarettes in front of me all the time. Iâ€™m like super mad about it, possibly irrationally angry about it cuz withdrawl and such. Any advice how to approach this without losing my temper or coming off holier than thou.thanks

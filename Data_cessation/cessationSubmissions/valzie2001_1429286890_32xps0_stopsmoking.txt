New Here, 35 years of smoking, 3 days so far of not!

Hi all, I'm looking for support, I have not yet told anyone in my family that I have quit, so much pressure and possible disappointment in prior attempts. This time I really want to quit, tired of the cigarettes controlling me, don't want to leave my kids motherless  because of health issues. Have a upcoming surgery on the 13th of May for knee replacement and I am so afraid something will go wrong because I have smoked so long. I am hoping for support and to support others that are going through this hell of not giving into the urges that can be so strong. Thanks :-)

Nicotine tabs (ie. blotting paper tabs)

Just wondering whether anyone has tried making nicotine tabs on [blotting paper](https://www.etsy.com/au/listing/265139120/blank-perforated-acid-free-blotting) (like some other drugs are delivered)?

I'm  spending a fortune on nicotine lozenges from the pharmacy.  Quit  smoking years ago and have tried vaping and various other forms of  delivery (patches, gum, spray, snuff, snus).  The mini Nicabate lozenges  available here are my preferred approach ATM - you can just stick one  between your lip and gum and no-one is any the wiser.

Found  a couple of threads of people making DIY lozenges with vape juice, and i  might try that.  However, sticking a small blotting paper tab under the  lip seems analogous to how i'm using the lozenges, so I might try that  first.

I assume it would just be a matter of titrating a drop or two of vape juice onto a square of blotting  paper using a syringe.  I couldn't find any prior examples with a quick  search though.

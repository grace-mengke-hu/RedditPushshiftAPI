One month no cigarettes or alcohol - nervous about the weekend

I successfully managed to not drink, smoke, or eat sugar for all of January! I feel pretty good about the discipline. But I'm worried that when I go out to have a couple couple cocktails this weekend it will be tempting to fall back into old habits. What's worked for you guys to steer the drunken mind away from its fixation with cigarettes?

My Day 1 Starts NOW!

Hello,

I was a smoker for three and a half years. 

I'm also Bipolar, which is prone to addictive behaviors, which adds a little bit to the difficulty level. 

I've successfully been off nicotine for a few weeks at a time on and off during it for one reason or another. The main reason I kept smoking is that I kept drinking at gatherings and my friends have cigarettes.

Here's my plan:

Labelling it as being an ex-smoker, rather than a nonsmoker, or just a normal person. Cigarettes will never be easy to be around and it is a serious life threatening addiction so I'm going to take it seriously.

I'm not going to be drinking either so I'll have stronger willpower at vulnerable moments.

Eating more delicious food to satisfy and divert cravings

Identifying and being aware which of my friends are smokers and nonsmokers/ex-smokers and only hanging out with nonsmokers/ex-smokers who are established in not smoking.

Anyways, I'll be updating here when I have a craving and at the end of every day and the struggles that I'm going through. This is the beginning of a cleaner healthier life!

Anyone who can help out with some tips and tricks to add to my list?

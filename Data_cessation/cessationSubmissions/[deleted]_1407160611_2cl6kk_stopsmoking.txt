So some things happened and I nearly lost my life. 2 weeks later I'm physicaly alright but it's impossible not to revisit what happened. And right now it really feels like I'm on a trial again. Yesterday felt exactly like I was back to day 1 if not stronger. I'm all out of nails to bite but I'm holding on because I'm done with it for good, unfortunately it clearly isn't done with me. I'm an optimistic, I know it will be gone eventually but I have to confess that at same time I am very very scared by it. Just wanted to share this with people who could understand. thank you

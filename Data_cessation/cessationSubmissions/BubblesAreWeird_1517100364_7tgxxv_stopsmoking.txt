How quitting has changed my life

Once you quit smoking, you tend to pick up new habits, unfortunately I stuffed my face with food to keep my mind off smoking.

Recently I've noticed I had been spending more money on food than I was on tobacco back when I smoked, so I set up a system (a tin piggy bank) that I put in a rough estimate of money every month that I would've used for smoking, and this is still working out.

So I've reduced on fast food a lot and I've got extra cash again. Now I've started a small hobby where I collect playing cards (expensive but it keeps my mind clear from picking up my old habits).

I've also started collecting bottle caps again (I encourage you guys on this, a lot of soft drinks out there) which I'm very proud of.

I'm also on the verge of helping a few friends of mine to quit too - one of them was successful, the other is very close.

Thanks for listening!

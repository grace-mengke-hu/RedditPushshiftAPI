i'm done

just smoked my last ciggie and threw away the packet. smoking is not enjoyable anymore. dragging feels like ripping razorblades across my throat. my lungs feel tight, my underarms sore. each drag brings a new cough, my head throbs slightly and my ear rings. this is not something i need or enjoy

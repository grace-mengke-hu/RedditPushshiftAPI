4 Month Check-In and New Tobacco Laws

1. 4 months. WOOOOOOO!!!!

2. I live in Indiana. A bill is going through our legislature right now that will drastically change the atmosphere around smoking in my state. 

This new bill will do four things, (1) Raise the minimum smoking age to 21, (2) Get rid of "smoker's right's" laws and allow companies to openly discriminate against smokers and not hire them, (3) Raise taxes on the sticks about $1.50 (making the pack where I live about 7-8 dollars), and (4) Use the increased taxes to support cessation programs


Now, I'm all for the cessation programs. Do it. Sweet.
Taxes? Sure. It tends to have the effect wanted...(although now those who can't stop are now forced into even tighter budget issues)
I also know that there is no actual Federal Law to stop an employer for discriminating against a smoker...
But the whole "21" thing is iffy for me. I guess I fall into the category of "You're 18, you make your own decisions...even if they are awful ones." group. Hell, an 18 yr old is deemed competent enough to die for the country. 

Do any of you guys have these laws? How did it work out? Does it have the effects they claim it will have?


P.S. I'm glad I'm off the damn things so this won't affect my pocketbook but damn. Just think if you were 20, had been smoking for 2 years, and BOOM you can't buy cigarettes anymore. If you weren't ready to quit...that'd be a nightmare.

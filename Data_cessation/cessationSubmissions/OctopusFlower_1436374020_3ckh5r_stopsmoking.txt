Today I extinguished my last cigarette

So, I recently starting reading allan carrs easy way to quit smoking, understand that I have smoked habitual for the last five years. Recently I started having problems with breathing, I would become short of breathe while smoking and for a short duration afterwards; I would feel exhausted, lethargic and just plain shitty if I didnt have a smoke. 
If you have had a hard time quitting smoking I suggest you read allan carr's book he flat out explains things in a diffrent way, he sets your mind into a whole diffrent view. I do not claim to be amazing at quitting things, I used to have a pretty serious cocaine problem for about a year of daily consistent use, I kicked that habit complete cold turkey now I understand it seems like an accomplisment but I came to the conclusion where I didnt understand how to quit smoking but could kick a habit that consumed my life, what I didnt realize was cigarettes were exactly the same addiction. I would like to share with you that I have no fear in quitting my parents smoke in their basement and I have no fear that it will cause me to want a smoke, I have no fear that I will pick another cigarette up. I must make you all aware that I am a smoker of marijuana, that I apologize will NEVER change.

I will continue to post on a daily basis to let you all know how it is going. I will not let myself down and I will live a happy non-smoking life..

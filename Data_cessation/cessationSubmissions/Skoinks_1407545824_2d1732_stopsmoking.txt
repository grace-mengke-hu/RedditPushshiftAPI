2 months without smoking, people still give me shit

Without sounding like a prima donna here, people give me shit for stopping and it can downright piss me off. Some of my buddies are smokers and like everyone, we all tried to quit at some point. I had a few failures, so did they, but I finally managed to kick the habit when I read... Yeah, you guessed it, Alan Carr's book, but that's not important.
The problem is, they still give me shit for stopping!
When the first week passed, the usual comment was "yeah, sure - we'll see in a month". A month passed and now they've moved the goalpost - now it's "I bet when you're back in autumn, you'll be smoking like a chimney". Now, they're my friends and they say it in half-jest, but I feel like they do it out of spite or a tiny bit of jealousy. 
I'm not gonna start smoking again because of some backhanded remarks and I get a laugh out of it when I see them light up and offer me one with a sly smirk, but it's just a tiny bit annoying.
The people I know who don't smoke, on the other hand are really proud of me (and I'd like to thank them for being supportive.. even though they won't read this, but I digress).

Have you guys encountered this with your friends and relatives?

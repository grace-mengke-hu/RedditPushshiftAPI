How do you deal with all of the free time?

So as of Monday, I have now been smoke free for about 48 hours. I quit for 6 days back in December but ended up failing due to a combination of alcohol and boredom. My biggest problem comes from all of my free time. During they day when I am at work its not much of an issue as I am busy and never smoked much at work anyway. But afterhours, and especially on the weekends, I am at a loss with what to do with myself. 

When I did smoke, I smoked about a pack a day. I would smoke about 3/4 of that at home as I was almost a chain smoker once I left work. Now, when I get back home I get nervous and twitchy and have no idea what to do. Does anyone have any tips with how to deal with the boredom?

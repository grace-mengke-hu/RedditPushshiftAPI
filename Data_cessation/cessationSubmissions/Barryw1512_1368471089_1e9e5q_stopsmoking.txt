Does the bad mood lift?

Hi there, I've managed too stay off the little demons for 21 days so far but have been in a horrible mood 90% of the time. I have basically turned into a mute as I don't feel like talking much with my mood being so poor so was wondering if my mood will improve? The reason I ask is I have read some people saying that they have gave up for years but still have strong cravings which I don't think I can handle if I'm honest. I was using patches for the first six days but stopped after I read allen carrs book. Thank you in advance for any advice given. Barry

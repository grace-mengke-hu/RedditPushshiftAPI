11 days. Close to my previous record.

TLDR; i quit lmao

&amp;#x200B;

Very recently I have decided to quit once and for all, not just to reduce smoker cough. Last time I made it to 14/15 days and came upon some very cheap, high quality extra tarry and death inducing clove cigarettes. I gave in.

This time I have quit.

Remember guys, smoking has no function and death is inevitable so why bring it closer?

Through the use of Buddhist philosophy I have finally seen the truth behind these malignant sticks. They are an illusion. Every time I smoke I am looking for some sort of deep relaxation that it never brings.

**It's like reaching for a mirage of an apple hanging just out of reach, getting bored of it, and then eventually coming back to try again an you don't even have a mouth.**  


Good luck all.

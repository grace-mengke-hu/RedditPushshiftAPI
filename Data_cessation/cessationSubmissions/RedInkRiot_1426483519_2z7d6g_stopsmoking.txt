How did your first weekend as a non-smoker go? (Bit of a rant/seeking some encouragement for the week ahead)

I quit cold turkey on Tuesday (on and off smoker of 8 years...probably a pack a day for a solid 5 years of that). I felt really motivated all week and like I was taking the cravings in stride and battling the mental bullshit pretty well for the most part. Then the weekend came. Stuck in a 950 square foot townhouse (cluttered, to boot) with my 2-year-old and my husband...who is still a smoker. (Luckily I find his brand repulsive at all times so having them in the house isn't driving me insane. Also he has been very supportive, and discreet about his smoking, since I decided to quit).

We got out of the house (per my request...*ahem, demand*) quite a bit so I didn't feel so bored and cooped up to make me anxious, but by Sunday afternoon I was actually getting excited about being at work tomorrow where I won't have to deal with anyone but my damn self (isolated work environment). 

Do the weekends get better? I feel guilty that basically all afternoon I just wanted to escape, but it's not really about my family, it's just about not wanting to deal with anyone but myself right now because I'm hard enough to deal with on my own without adding other people's needs and emotions into the mix. It was all just a bit much, and I'm feeling a little disgruntled and overwhelmed after today.

Can anyone offer some insight? Tips? An "I feel ya girlfriend"? Anything will help to wake up to in the morning. I'm committed to the cause, just needing some mental fuel. This sub has been awesome for me the last several days, so thanks to anyone who has encouraged me in some way :)

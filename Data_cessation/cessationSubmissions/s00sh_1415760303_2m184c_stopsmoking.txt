So I'm about to roll my last one.

I quit earlier on this year, for four months. I was very active in this sub at the time. But for me, it was a bit of a tease. I kept looking, knowing that while I was proud of myself, I probably hadn't smoked my last. Not this time. 

This time, it's for good. A flick has switched in my mind. I'm going to take this world by storm. I have wasted a lot of time during my 26 years, but not anymore. 

I'm not going to come back in here. I'm done. This is my promise to myself, and to you guys. 

I genuinely hope you all manage to quit and stay quit. There are no benefits. It tastes like shit no matter how much you try and convince yourself otherwise. It's killing you. It's killing me. 

Find the fucking strength, because you've been a slave and you're letting yourself continue to be. 

I'm nearly through with this shameful cigarette now. I am me. I am my friends, family and everything that I appreciate in this beautiful world. I am a dedicated person. 

Smoking is not me anymore. 

Thanks for listening. I wish you well.

Everyone that is having difficulty with relapse needs to read this.

I've read countless websites, The Easyway book, and talked to people that have stopped. I KNOW smoking is ruining my life. I experience negative effects that are quite serious even now and it still didn't stop me. None of it seemed to work for me. I am admittedly not that far in, but I genuinely feel that I now have the mindset to do this. I found what I needed in [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/15ngpx/i_need_an_explanation_please/c7o1tdu) about the mind of a drug addict. Read the paragraph that begins with "Again" and replace every mention of heroin with nicotine and this describes me perfectly. I could always make an excuse or a justification to smoke just one which of course turned into more. This post really changed my perception of things.

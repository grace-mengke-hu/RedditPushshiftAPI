Why do i feel like I lose my sex drive when I quit smoking?

I know smoking is horrible for your sex life including the smell, weaker erections and less stamina. But it feels like when I quit smoking I lose my desire to have sex, and when I start smoking again I regain that desire. How long will it take for me to see a return of sex drive after I quit smoking. I'm having sex every week with a fwb and I enjoy having sex with her but I also want to quit smoking and I'm afraid when I do, as I've noticed, I will lose my sex drive.

Amazing stop

So this is a true story. My dad used to smoke every day. He would smoke usually after every meal. But he was really healthy. He even went to the doctor once and doc said he had the healthiest lungs he's ever seen. Anyway my dad didn't want to quit smoking. Then one day he had a stroke. It was minor, he couldn't feel left half of his body (hes fine now).after the stroke he stopped smoking. He didn't use any nicotine gum or patches, nothing. He just stopped and didnt have any withdrawal symptoms what so ever. He hasn't smokes since then and it's 4 years going. My message is so stop before a tragedy happens and forces you to stop.

Hi! I stopped smoking today and I have a few questions.

Hello!  First of all, what is your opinion on nicotine gum vs quitting cold turkey? P.S. I used to smoke 5-10 cigs a day. I have been a smoker for 1.5 years.  Also, how do you not relapse when drinking? It has a been a huge problem for me that after a "fun" night I would wake up with an empty pack, therefore I'm scared that the next time I'll get drunk I will light up. Any tips are appreciated. Cheers

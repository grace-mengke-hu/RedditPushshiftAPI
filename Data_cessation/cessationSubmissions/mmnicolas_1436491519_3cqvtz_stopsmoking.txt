How I stopped smoking without really noticing

I've been smoking a pack a day for 15 years, also been smoking marijuana daily for 15 years. Haven't touched either for a week now, I threw away all my pothead equipment, still have a pack of cigs in my drawer and frankly I am myself surprised I'm not even thinking about it. 

What happened ? I got into the RDA (rebuildable dripping atomizer) hobby, this has been working wonders for me. I'm taking deep lung hits so I get that lungful satisfaction like when I was smoking pot while saturating myself of nicotine.

Been watching videos from this guy for nearly a year now and it looked really cool: https://www.youtube.com/user/RiPTrippers

I thought if I ever have an urge to smoke real cigarettes, I'd just sit down and build myself new coils, try different wire, different juice etc. Eventually I ordered the necessary to start:

* Japanese Organic Cotton
* Eleaf iStick 50W Battery
* Some e-juice 6mg nicotine
* Double Twisted 28 AWG Kanthal Wire
* Velocity RDA Clone by Tobeco

Here's what it looks like: http://imgur.com/hSpJXja

The clouds I'm making with this are just amazing and building coils and wicking is just plain fun. AMA!

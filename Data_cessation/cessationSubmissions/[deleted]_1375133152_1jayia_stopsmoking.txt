When does the celebration begin?

I am happy to have made it to this point.  When does it start to ease up on thinking about it.  I feel like the thought enters my head then doesn't leave.  In my head I plan ways of avoiding smoking especially around my friends that smoke.  I still have that empty feeling.  I have been staying away from home because I got so used to putting down a project to take a smoke break on the deck.  When was it for the rest of you that you could think to yourselves I AM GONNA MAKE IT!

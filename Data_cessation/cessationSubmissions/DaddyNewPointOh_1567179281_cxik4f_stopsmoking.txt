I really need to quit smoking, looking for advice.

I guess I'll just preface this with the fact that I have an addictive personality. As a kid, I was addicted to video games. At age 17 I started drinking daily, and decided to quit one day. At age 23, I became addicted to heroin for a few years, quit cold turkey and never think about it because quite frankly I was miserable the entire time. For a little while after that I was "addicted" to smoking copious amounts of weed (my ex fiancee and I were once at the point where we were smoking an ounce every two days) Alas, I don't even smoke weed anymore. Cigarettes are the only vice I have left in my life but I feel like this is going to be one of the toughest for me. I really want to start working out again and lose the weight that I gained during my relationship, but I'm under an extreme amount of stress lately and I've been smoking even more. I typically have high anxiety and for me the best part of it is smoking a cigarette is simply something to do to distract myself most of the time. I feel like trying to start working out while smoking a pack to a pack and a half a day probably isn't wise. Any solid suggestions for a guy like me? Sorry for the long post. ðŸ™‚

I failed. Time to start again...

Today was my 13th day of quitting smoking cold turkey after smoking for 16 years. I've attempted to quit multiple times in the past using a variety of methods, though this time I was doing it. I broke through some intense cravings, usually by chewing gum, but I just couldn't do it anymore. During an intense craving I stepped out of my car and my phone fell out of my pocket and crash I smashed my screen. That was it I couldn't take it and went immediately to the store and purchased a small pack came home and smoked. I feel like I let myself and my family down. It felt so right and assisted in bringing my nerves down, though I don't want to live this way anymore. What do you do to help break through those intense cravings that refuse to go away even after hours? I see this as a failure though I know it's just a minor set back in my journey. Wish me luck.

Help...stressed and panicking over Christmas

Hi, I am new and 4 days in. Third attempt. I so badly want to kick the evil habit and I am stubborn which helps but next weekend is my Christmas party. Im not a big drinker but would like to have a drink but I know It will make me want to go outside with my smoking friends. Any tips to get me through would be very welcome! Eek...

Just shy of 72 hours

It's really frustrating when the cravings hit.  And sometimes it's like really weird because it's a combination of disgust/desire at the same time.  Like when I see someone else smoking.  I live in Cali so smoking cigarettes is a big social stigma here.  People would actually go out of their way to be rude to me if they saw me smoking.  I see people trying to hide on corners and smoke and I want just one drag or even the homeless guy curled up next to a building smoking or cigarette butts laying on the streets and the urge hits.  Then there's the before work cigarettes and the after work cigarettes.  Trying to stay strong.

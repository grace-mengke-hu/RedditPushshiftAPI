Path so far

I smoked for a long time, given my age that is. Nearly half my life. Awhile ago I switched to vaping I won't count the days precisely because honestly that would do me more harm then good but it's been about a month. A very good month at that. Laid out a plan with my father, who understands the process, and have kept to it. 


This post is more or less to get everything out and perhaps help me when I might have some invasive thought, you know the type. So far the plan is 60 days 3mg, then 60 days half 3 mg half 0. Then 1:3 and eventually get rid of nicotine completely. Then, and only then, attempt to put the vape down. 


I hear the action itself is the hardest but I simply can't imagine that being the case. Took a good week for the cravings I was having to go away. Wanting to smoke when you are smoking is a very weird experience.

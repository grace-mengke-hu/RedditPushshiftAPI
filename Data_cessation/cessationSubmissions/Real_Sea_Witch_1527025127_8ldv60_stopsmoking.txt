I had 10 months under my belt....

I went 10 months without a single drag of a cigarette. Quit cold turkey on the first try after 15 years of smoking. Ran into an old friend and shared a cigarette (why?!). Now here I am a month later and Iâ€™ve bought 4 packs total. Borderline full time smoking again this week. I had my last one and plan to requit as of right now. Please remind me why I want to quit more than I want to smoke!

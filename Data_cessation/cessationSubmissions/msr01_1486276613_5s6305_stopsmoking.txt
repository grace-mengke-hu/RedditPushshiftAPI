I just went 72 hours without nicotine after smoking for 26 years :)

I have tried a few times over the years to quit with patches but it hasn't worked.
Got some mint nicotine lozenges and tried one and it was disgusting and I tasted what I think is the nicotine and knew I would not have another one. That was Thursday and today is Sunday.
I am nicotine free now and it has been a rough few days with dizziness etc. Heck I have been doing breathing exercises every time I felt dizzy or panicky and it has worked. I was worried about crashing whilst driving a few times because of the withdrawal but breathing really helped. In through your nose and out of your mouth just doing that helped heaps.
I have quit for good now.
There is no going back. I was going through 25 grams of tobacco every two days which is $30 AUD which is $23 US.
It was making me sick and just became pointless.
When your time is right for you will get sick of poisoning yourself and quit.

Thanks for reading and every time I get a craving I do the breathing exercise and tell myself how unnecessary smoking is. It doesn't do anything except for a quick rush that lasts a minute or two. Breath fast and quick and you will get the same rush.

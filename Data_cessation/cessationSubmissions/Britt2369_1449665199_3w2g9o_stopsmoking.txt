One week!

I honestly am surprised I have made it this far. 
It certainly hasn't been easy, but I have not lost my motivation for quitting once. Which is new because usually during my other quits, by this point I have forgotten my reason for quitting and feel like I am truly giving something up. Not this time! I constantly have my reasons for quitting on the back of my mind and I know it's what is getting me through the bad cravings!!! 
I work with a lot of people who smoke, and they look at me with sad eyes and mouth "I'm sorry" as they are sneaking outside to smoke, and by day 4 I was thinking to myself, don't feel sorry for me, I feel sorry for you! 

Thank you so much to everyone in this sub, you all are great, and I swear the first three or four days I was creeping on here constantly. I plan to stay around here and utilize the support I have here, and hopefully offer support to newcomers as well.

r/stopsmoking! I need some help with it

* Since the beginning of this year (1st January) I decided that I'll quit! (It's actually me and my wife both) So we both quit for about a few weeks until a party and then there were drinks and just one cig!
* We didn't fell into it again and managed to go on for another few weeks. but then one night a friend offered another cig and we went by like this for this whole year! (It feels like I've quit but not really completely, I fear that it is chasing us like this and may return again easily) 

* Recently it's become more frequent again. Unfortunately almost all our friends smoke. So everyday we are exposed to it. we smoke a a cig tonight and then again for a few days I have the urge and I have to fight with it. 
* Let's say within this year we only might have smoked about 4-5 packs maximum (80-100 cigs) but am still worried and **I just want to be able to say NO to it all the time**, because I know how hard it become again and again after a party where I smoke a cig. 
* I've tried all different types of tools: ecig, patches, gums etc. 

* I'll be glad to hear from you about this situation.

The flu ðŸ˜· made it easier!

Last Wednesday I smoked my last cigarette - despite feeling crappy. Then I got in bed and slept pretty much straight through 36 hours - so this flu bug gave me a reason - and winter is coming so who wants to be miserable in the cold just to get a fix!!! I've been smoking about a pack a day for decades - I think my last attempt to quit was about ten years ago. Looking forward to all the positives that will come as I move forward being a former smoker. Glad I found this resource too because it's nice to know I'm not alone. Just thinking about the money I spent over the years is sobering. I'm also going to quit coffee and alcohol for a bit because the association with smoking is strong - and alcohol doesn't really enhance my judgement. Thanks for sharing your stories and wish me luck.

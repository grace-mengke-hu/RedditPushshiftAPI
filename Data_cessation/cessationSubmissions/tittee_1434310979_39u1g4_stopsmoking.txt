Australian in Thailand!!

So I'm an Australian in Thailand (phi phi Island to be specific). I'm on my second last day of 10 and haven't had a cigarette til now. Heavily intoxicated I saw my sister who is also intoxicated who usually doesn't smoke and knows how hard I've tried to quit have one and decide to have one too. Which led to another and another. Then we bought a pack and I think I've had like Atleast 10 tonight. I've had one before about a month in, it was forced down my throat by a smoker friend at a festival and when I mean forced he literally put one in my mouth lit and ready to go, of course I smoked it and regretted it so much. After that day I was craving hard for Atleast 5 days but still managed to stop and not smoke and thus I didn't change my badge. I've been a long time lurker here and the reason why I am writing this is I don't have that disgusting feeling as I did last time when I smoked. I even enjoyed it. I know my sister who has never been addicted won't understand the pain I will go through tomorrow with not trying to smoke. This post is semi like a journal entry. Thanks for all that have read. All comments negative or positive are welcome. Ciao

I feel like I'm going crazy.

So... I quit before new years because I hate resolutions, but I knew I needed to quit.  I'm 30, started smoking at 19 (I wanted my mom to stop treating me like a kid and she smoked, but I didn't think I'd get hooked, hahaha), quit when I was 26 because my boyfriend had some smoking-related heart issues, and I wanted to make his quit easier, and I started up again two years ago on the day of my Dad's funeral.  

Does this get betterr?  I bought Allen Carr's Easy Way and have read that, but I guess I'm still brainwashed because as nasty as it is, I just want a cigarrette so bad.  I think I need to re read it.   When I quit for my boyfriend, I used an e-cig and stopped using it after two or three months.  It wasn't easy, but I got through it, and didn't smoke for about a year and half.  I just thought I'd have the mental fortitude to cold turkey it this time. 

I guess it doesn't help that I work in a machine shop and everyone there smokes-- I'm surrounded by ash trays all day.   

I'm sorry, I don't know why I'm writing this.  I just had a terrible day at work, I was so slow, couldn't focus, I'm postitive I messed an order up, and my anxiety is going through the roof.  I don't want to light up, I'm so proud of these five days and I don't want them to be wasted, but I feel like I'm litterally going to jump out of my skin.  I think the cravings and anxiety attacks have merged. 

tl;dr:  ARGHHHHH.

I guess I quit.

Been smoking for 14 years or so. Pack a day habit, first thing in the morning and last thing in the night I did was smoke one.

I have nicotine pastilles that I've sucked on at work and this morning something snapped and I just took one of those instead of the smoke. I've had a bunch of intense cravings during the day, but somehow I've survived. I've been on the edge, dizzy, annoyed and angry the whole day, but right now I feel fine. Probably have to deal with some cravings later, but at the moment chips seem to keep me in check.

Also I've been trying to keep myself busy the whole day doing small things, but it's evening already and pretty soon I have absolutely nothing to do.

No questions or anything, I just wanted to share with people who know what I'm going through.

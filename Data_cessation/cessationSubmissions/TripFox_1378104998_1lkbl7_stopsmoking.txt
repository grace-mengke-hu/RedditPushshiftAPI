One month done - arrhythmia, nightmares and general horribleness decreased.

Quit smoking on 7/31.  Been a month without a cig (save one drag off a friend's in the first 10 days).  

I am 31 and have smoked roughly 1/2 a pack a day since 20.  I quit cold turkey.

It's been hard.  Particularly in the dream world.  I have had some horrible nightmares that would make people think I needed to be committed.  Never used Xanax before, but had to borrow 3 or 4 off a coworker as I went into panic attacks at times.  This was mostly in the first 10 days.

Getting easier...getting easier.

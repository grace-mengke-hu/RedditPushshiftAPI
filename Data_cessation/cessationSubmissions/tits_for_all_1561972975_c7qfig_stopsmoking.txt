Insane Cravings after 466 days - anyone else experienced this?

Hi,

I haven't had any nicotine since I quit last March after a 15 year 1.5 pack a day habit. I do partake an occasional blunt - but they are only weed and no nicotine or any other additives. 

Since waking up today, I have been having a sort of smell nostalgia where I keep smelling cigarette smoke and I think I am craving for one again. 

Anyone else experienced this?

Day 2 smoke free and...

Honestly it hasn't been that bad. I have been smoking for about 5 years and my latest addiction has been those goddamn juuls. I was extremely worried because in case you didn't know, they are much more addictive and have way more nicotine than a pack of smokes. Knowing this I was afraid that quitting would be the end of me, but after 2 days, it really hasn't been that bad at all. Outside of thinking about smoking in my classes throughout the day as long as I keep busy I don't miss it too much. So far so good, just gotta keep to it. Easier said than done...

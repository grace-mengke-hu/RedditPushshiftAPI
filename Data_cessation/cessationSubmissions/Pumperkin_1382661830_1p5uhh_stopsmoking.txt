"The Book" I just started reading it.... confused.

Hi there.  I'm currently 3 days into my quit.  I started reading Allen Carr's book The Easy Way to Stop Smoking.  The second chapter instructs the reader that it is ESSENTIAL to keep smoking until you complete the entire book.  This, coupled with the proposition in Chapter 1 that failure in the method is due to failure to carry out instructions, I am in a bit of a conundrum.   I would love any excuse to go out and get me some cigarettes in the name of quitting.  This sounds absolutely ludicrous, except in the mind of an addict.  So what gives?  Can anyone who has read the book please explain how this makes any logical sense?  I've been led to the impression that this book can be an immensely helpful tool in kicking.  I would like to give it a go, but if I'm already committed to not smoking, is it a waste of time for me?  I have been using NRT (gum), which the author states is a useless gimmick.  What of kicking the gum after I complete the book?  I went through almost all of today without the nasty gum anyways - evenings are a rough, idle time :(  I feel like a helpless idiot.  Advice?

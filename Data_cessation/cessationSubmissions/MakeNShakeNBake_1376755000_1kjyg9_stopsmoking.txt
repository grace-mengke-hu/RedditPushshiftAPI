I've failed to quit after 6 months of sobriety.

It was a great run! After the first week things seemed to be easy, then a month and then 6 months passed. Then some drama involving a relationship happened on top of the stress if moving pushed me to pick up the habit again. Only this time... The cost of smoking has financially doubled to nearly 10$ a pack. I feel at a loss and as a failure. I'm hesitant to go through what I did the first time but I know it's something that's good in the long run. I need support to go cold turkey again before my body starts to get used to it. This is an admission of defeat and a cry for support to perservere to try again. Help!

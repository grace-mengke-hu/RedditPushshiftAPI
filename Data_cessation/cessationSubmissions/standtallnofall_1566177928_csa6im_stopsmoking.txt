I wish I could know how I was going to die.

Because if I knew it wasn't related to smoking, I wouldn't have to go through this torturous process of quitting.

I'm 12 days and 20 hours in. I'm using Chantix. The hardest thing at the moment is that I don't know if the Chantix is working. I've never quit using any other method so I have no baseline. 

I want to smoke so bad but my ultimate stop right now is that I'm so tired of being the, "I'm gonna quit" guy. I've said it so many times that people don't believe it and I can't blame them.

I cannot believe it - i am still hooked

Im craving for just one spliff, even though i hate cigarettes and weed makes me feel horrible i still want to roll a joint, smoke it, feel awkward, feel bad. I have not realised that by quitting cigarettes i'll make a new addiction to spliffs... I never liked'em, usually smoked a pipe or blunts, but now, since im on a good way to quit weed i do not crave for weed, i desperately want to smoke a spliff i want them combined. I think i'll relapse soon on both tobacco and weed, prolly alchohol too, and drunk and blazed im also going to do other stupid things i've been trying to stop lately.

Inner dance party

1 week ago I had to reset my badge. Tonight I decided to put myself in the same situation with the same group of people only this time I was armed with my own disappointment in myself last time and a weeks worth of reading all of the posts here.  Happy to say that I had a fantastic evening and do not need to reset my badge again.  Thank you for all of the posts and support that is here, it as certainly seen me through this trigger.

Day 9, no more craving but extreme fatigue and drowsiness

Hi,

I am on the 9th day of my cold turkey quit and finally, I feel the cravings have subsided. Now I want cigarettes as much as I want a cold beer on a warm working day - it will sure be nice to have one, but no way am I going to get it.

My problem is I am super tired all the time and I could sleep for like 18-20 hours a day. Is this normal? I was expecting that maybe a week or so later my energy levels will really spike but the complete reverse has happened. I have zero energy and zero motivation to do anything. I am like a zombie coming to work, lazing off the whole work day and going back home to sleep. When will it get better?

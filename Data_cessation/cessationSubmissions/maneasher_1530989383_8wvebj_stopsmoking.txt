Stressors come to surface

As we go thru this smoke free journey we have established that there is many triggers, habit built reasons we give in to another smoke. 

I only recently came to face with my deep triggers. The obvious ones, stress and weakness. 

My mom passed young 6months ago and I’m currently going thru a divorce. I have never felt a better reason to be smoking. But I don’t and I haven’t. 

With these life events, truly deep emotion has come to surface. The kind I knew was there but doesn’t come to light without agitation. 

So, one day at a time and sometimes a fleeting moment to moment. 

I continue to encourage all of you that continue down your journey and truly wish you luck. It does get easier I promise.

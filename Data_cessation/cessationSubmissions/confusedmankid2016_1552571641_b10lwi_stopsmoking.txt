36 days without smoking and I feel terrible

I was a very heavy smoker for a few years and quit 36 days ago but feel horrible. My anixety and stress has been at an all time high, not as bad as my first 2 weeks but I'm still uncomfortably anxious and tense. The good news is that my lungs are working better and I'm coughing up tar. My sleep patterns are messed up and I'm wondering how long it will take me to feel normal again. Any advice would be appreciated.

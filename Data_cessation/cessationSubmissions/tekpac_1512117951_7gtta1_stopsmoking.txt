4th time trying to quit. Would love any advice or insight.

I’m 23 years old, and have been using tobacco products since I was around 16. Didn’t start smoking cigarettes consistently until around 19-20. My addiction got triggered after a soft run in with the law (possession of marijuana, less than a gram. I live in ARIZONA where it’s no tolerance) so I got put on TASC. I was an avid weed smoker, so when i had to drop UAs i tried to go back to smoking black and molds like i was 16 again. Fast forward, i grew up and stopped making freedom jeopardizing dumb mistakes, however, in my most recent years, I found out that smoking wasn’t quite for me either. Most strains heighten my anxiety, and I don’t have a certification so I cant control what strain I get every time, so I gave that up too.. 

I wanted to post in this sub to get any suggestions or feedback on kicking the habit, cold turkey, and not going back. This is my 4th time going for it, and I’m a little intimidated by the addiction. Would love to hear some of you guys stories and how you’ve broken them mental barriers to get back to a smoke free life.

Having a very hard time getting started

I've been smoking for 6 years. As of new years 2013, i had been off for 5 months...then stress started to set in. Relationships (or lack there of), money problems and an overall loss of direction has built up a tremendous amount of stress to my life. Going back to cigarettes just happened one day and i'm up to a pack a day, more than i smoked before. I wake up wheezing, i need an inhaler and it's certainly putting a dent in my savings. I tried to quit the other weekend but then a shit storm of negativity plagued me for the entire day and i couldn't handle it, i felt like i was going to have a nervous breakdown. I work as a bartender as well in a very smoke filled environment so it doesn't help. 

how the hell do i get started

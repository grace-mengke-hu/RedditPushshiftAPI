I never thought I would be able to quit, I honestly thought I would be hooked until the day I die. Then one day I just walked away and never looked back.

and it is such an empowering feeling to be nicotine free for 17 whole days, with absolutely no intentions of picking it back up again. I feel like having accomplished this I really can do anything, and let me tell you, I have been through the trials and tribulations in these past weeks.


10/10 would recommend to anyone.

Cutting can be a happy process

Almost 5days
 This morning, I felt so happy and free, waking up without the need to put smoke on my chest to start the day or to be in my normal state.
Cutting is a happy process, I now spend money on ice cream, food, and face/ hair masks and taking care of myself, it feels so refreshing.
I also woke up happy and talked to my parents and had a long talk and also with friend, I no more need to take break and go smoke and come back woth a weird smell and vibe.
Truely, this is freedom.

Today my GP told me that I look way healthier than when he last saw me and it’s only been 11 days since I quit!

Apart from the occasional craving, I haven’t really missed smoking at all. This is what feels like my hundredth attempt at quitting. Last time I managed to quit for about a month and I was struck by HORRENDOUS quitters flu and intense mood swings. This time round has been much better. I’ve had the occasional mood swing but I tend to get over it if I isolate myself and do something relaxing. I’ve been exercising, drinking 2 litres of water a day and eating really healthy. I feel the best I’ve ever felt! And in addition to that I’ve been saving so much money - I can’t believe I spent years wasting money on something that was slowly killing me!

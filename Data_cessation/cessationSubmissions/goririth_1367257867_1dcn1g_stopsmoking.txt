So frustrated and i dont know what to do next

How do i handle the fact that i am SO ready to quit (I have tried several time and failed...ignore my badge) but my husband isnt? The majority of things we do revolves around the cigarette such as a drink after work...but i don't want to give that up. He is supportive, meaning he willing to go outside to smoke and not smoke in the car with me but the last time i had quit i was 2.5 weeks in and we were entertaining...everyone was outside smoking and i felt so left out. How impossible is it to quit when your SO isnt ready?
Edit: Figured out how to remove my badge.....that sucked. I wanna cry right now :(

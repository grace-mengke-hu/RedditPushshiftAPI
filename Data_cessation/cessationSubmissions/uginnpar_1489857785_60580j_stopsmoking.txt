Cold turkey for two weeks now!

I've been smoking for 11 years now and then March 4th 2017 came 2130H i just decided to quit smoking, ive tried to quit a hundred times before and i always failed, i guess that time im not ready to give it up but i think this time i got this. Its all about the mindset, your motivation on why you are quitting. Being a quitter doesn't always mean your losing, by quitting smoking your actually winning see for yourself the difference from the time you quit, you woke up in the morning, your activities of daily living, relationships with your family every single thing will improve so if your planning to quit congrats on wanting to ditch 7000 plus bad chemicals per stick! Not another puff no matter what!

Stopping while your partner still smokes

Today is my quit day. I quit in February for 10 days while my partner was out of state visiting family. She came back and of course bought cigs, which prompted me to start again.

Anyone in a similar situation have advice on how to stay off them while your partner continues? We both want to quit but she lacks the willpower quite a bit more than I do. I'm hoping if she doesn't quit that maybe seeing myself not smoke for say a month or so, will show her it's possible.

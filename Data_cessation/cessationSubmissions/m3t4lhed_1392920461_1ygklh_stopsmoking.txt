One week

So it has been a week and now I have learned on how to handle the cravings. I have been smoking all of my adult-life and smoking is an integral part of who I am.  The friends I have, the people who I chat at work with and my father, they all smoke. The one thing that I have realized is that after a certain period of time, smoking becomes a ritual. The post meal smoke, the tea/coffee break smoke, the last hour of the week smoke etc. I was, by personality and by nature, a smoker who always had a reason to be outside with a cigarette. I don't even know if non-smokers have this general dissatisfaction which smokers relate to as cigarette cravings.

All I do now is consider myself as a non-smoker. Smoking is no more a part of me.....

Feels amazing!!!

Vaping vs Smoking

Former smoker, turned to vaping;

From what Iâ€™ve heard, vaping is healthier than smoking in terms of less chemicals being added to the body, however being able to take drags off of my vape more freely and not having to go outside to do so, I feel like I use my vape way more than I smoked cigarettes.

My question is, does Reddit feel like it will be harder to stop vaping than it would have been to stop smoking cigarettes?

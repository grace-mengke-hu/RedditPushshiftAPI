My nicotine taper

I'm on a nicotine taper with my vape. I've been dropping 1mg nicotine every 200ml of liquid. I'm starting to get impatient though and was wondering if I should do it every 100ml. I'm on 2mg right now and would drop to 1mg after this 100ml bottle is used up as opposed to another bottle of 2mg. What say you?

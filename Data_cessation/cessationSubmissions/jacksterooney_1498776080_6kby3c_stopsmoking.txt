So I just wasted Â£15 on two cigarettes...

So on day 4 of cold turkey, I was feeling shitty and decided to drink half a bottle of wine by myself. Obviously, my cravings went beserk, I was feeling awful, and went to buy a whole new pack.

I smoked two, and am now feeling no cravings, but feel awful about my self control. I want to throw the rest of the pack away, but don't want to then feel crap about wasting so much money just to feel the pangs tomorrow.

Am I being crazy by wanting to flush the rest of the tobacco down the loo? I really feel like I need the cold logic of strangers for this...

I was a secret smoker. What is your most ridiculous secret smoking story?

I quit for 11 years. Picked up last summer ("just one...") and nine months later I am quitting. Day 3 and I feel miserable to be honest. I kept my smoking secret so now I have no support network other than this community. Anyway, I didn't smoke in public and I hid it from my children. I had to sneak outside, run in, brush my teeth and squirt on some perfume before I could reappear. So I hid from my own children. Ridiculous. Anyone have any similar experiences?

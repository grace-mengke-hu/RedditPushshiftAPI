Hey r/stopsmoking, I'm a sophomore in college

So obviously smoking in college is common, and yes I am one of the masses who partakes in the activity. However recently I've been teetering on the line of "Am I addicted, or do I just want a cigarette?" Obviously I'm playing with fire and all common sense would be to get out if I can, but I wanted to know for my anxiety's sake what you all thought.

I appreciate that most of you will say "No, stop now, it's bad for you" and I believe you, but it is a fun time and a nice thing to do with friends. What can you say that I haven't heard that would convince me to quit? Ultimately it's my responsibility to want to stop, but I'm not fully convinced I need to. I have normally 4 or 5 a day, usually after 12pm and normally reserve most of them for social situations.

How to handle people in your life who are smokers?

Hi everyone, 

I'm just wondering if any of you deal with people in your life who are smokers still? My girlfriend is still a heavy smoker and I find sometimes just being around her can give me cravings. Any advice would be appreciated. Have been able to resist the cravings so far and am looking forward to two weeks tomorrow. 

Cheers

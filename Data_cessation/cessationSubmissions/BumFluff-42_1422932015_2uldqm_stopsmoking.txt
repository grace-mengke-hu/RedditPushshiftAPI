Day 2 oberservations

Feeling more tired than usual, but also more relaxed.

I feel more lucid in a way, i feel less focussed on my inner voice, my mind seems to be more free flowing, drawing more associations between my surroundings and my memories, and somehow this makes my surrounds feel clearer.

Something like a hollow feeling in the top of my head, a bit like a headache. 

Mood swings.

Keep relapsing, don’t know what to do

    As the title says, I keep relapsing and not entirely sure how to proceed going forward.  Read all the books, downloaded all the apps, and it all makes sense on an intellectual level, but nothing has truly “clicked”; I’m still so convinced I love smoking and need cigarettes to get through each day.

    Quit for two days one week, three days this past week, but I keep falling back into the trap, even after I started feeling minor improvements in my mind, body, and health. My baseline is pretty anxious and neurotic and I definitely think the lethargy and lack of energy caused by cigarettes helps slow my racing mind and mellows me out.   Not particularly happy with my situation (a lonely 30-year-old living at home who’s really struggling financially) and cigarettes have always been my “escape” from the real word that have always allowed me to just chill.   They’re so engrained in my daily routine that I’ve really struggled with how to substitute that time with something new.  No real point to this post, just been feeling stuck and feeling like a failure and just had to vent, thanks guys.

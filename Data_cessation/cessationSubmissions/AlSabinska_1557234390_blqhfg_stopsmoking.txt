After 2 mounth of being non-smoker I started again..

First, it was just a feeling that I want to smoke, and I asked my friend for Iqos cigarette with a nice smell..

I didn't like it. 

Then I have bought a pack of smokes and smoked it with very pleasant feeling. 

I didn't like the smell and taste of it. 

After, I have started smoking Iqos of my friend regularly at work (even thought I don't have my own). 

Now, I am quitting again. I don't like it. 

I don't like how hard it is to quit, and how easy it is to start again! Why is it so? 

I lost the flow of time...

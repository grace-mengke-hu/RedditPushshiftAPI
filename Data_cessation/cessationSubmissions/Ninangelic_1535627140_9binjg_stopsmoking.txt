My quit date is September 1st. Tips and advice is very welcome!

So me and my boyfriend is quitting September 1st. What helped you the most when you quit? I’ve quit before with the help of ecig, but I wanna do it without this time because I don’t feel like dealing with having to fill it, charge it and keep it on me all the time. I don’t like vaping without nicotine and I really wanna be 100% nicotine free.

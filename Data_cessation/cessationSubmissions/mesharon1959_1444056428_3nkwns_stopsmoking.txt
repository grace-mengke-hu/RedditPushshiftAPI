31 Days

Finally hit a month. Yesterday I finally started coughing crap up. I was beginning to worry it would never happen. I was super scared as I'm going through an unrelated health scare right now, that I wouldn't cough it all up and that I would have another health issue. It's nice to have my mind put to rest. I'll be seeing my regular doctor soon though to have a thorough health check just to make sure I'm in good health - in the meantime I'm looking forward to hitting month #2!!

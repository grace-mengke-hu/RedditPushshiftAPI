So my brother came to town..

So my brother just came home on  a vacation from college (he lives at the other extremity of the country).  We had our last cigarette when  he came last time, 2 weeks ago (that was an emergency, he usually comes once a month, or even two) . We haven't had any problems til now. The problem  is, we really enjoy hiding together from our parents, taking the car and driving to all new places to smoke and relax.. And I feel like I'm missing an opportunity if we don't smoke the whole time he is here.

You can take it as a tl;dr: Now the real question is, how much harm will it do, if I only smoke once a month, when my brother comes to visit, since it's our favorite activity? Should I even reset my badge? I don't have cravings and I can already consier myself a nonsmoker.

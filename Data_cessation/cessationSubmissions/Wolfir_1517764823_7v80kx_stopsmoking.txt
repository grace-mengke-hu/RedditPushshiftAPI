Any way to get free nicotine gum in NJ?

Does anyone know how to get free nicotine gum in NJ?

I quit a few months ago, and I've been on nicotine gum ever since. I ran out of gum, and before I knew it, I was asking a smoker if he could spare a cigarette.

I definitely don't want to relapse at this point. Anyone know how to get free nicotine gum?

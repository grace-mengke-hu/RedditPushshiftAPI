Day one - here I go

It's day one for me again. I've developed a smoker's cough. I watched my mother die from COPD. A horrible death. When I was my daughter's age, I remember noticing my mom's cough for the first time. I have been addicted to cigarettes since I was in the womb. It is time to put this addiction away. A was a member of another forum similar to this one a couple of years ago. At the time, I had just graduated with my Masters degree and was cleaning up my life and doing well. Then, my mom's house burned down and I had to take over her care. We were not close, to say the least, but that's a story for another day. She had both Alzheimer's and COPD, so she couldn't understand why she couldn't breathe. She often grabbed the front of my shirt and pulled me towards her mouth, wanting me to breathe for her. Horrible horrible horrible. Today is day one for me, again. If necessary, I will try over and over again until it sticks. I'm done.

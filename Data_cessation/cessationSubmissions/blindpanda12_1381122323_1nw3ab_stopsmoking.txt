need myself back

I am 26 years old. Smoking since i was 16. Im a musician and my vocals are a big part of my music (along with playing the bass guitar)and i find my stamina decreasing and thus am jeopordizing my future as it is my life passion and desire to be a touring artist. Anyway I just threw my pack of Belmonts (im from toronto canada) . 12 bux spent on that shit. I smoke weed, but im gonna cut down on that too. I miss having complete control of my mind. Even though the weed helps me creatively and the smoke with so called stress. Although from reading other posts it seems the simple things are what really make smokers attached. (a certain scenery on a nice night and a beautiful view with a smoke in the hand etc etc etc) anyway. here goes everything.

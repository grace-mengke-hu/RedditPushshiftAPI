Help! Quitting is ruining my relationship!

I'm on day 9 of no cigarettes and I'm constantly low and cranky. The love of my life has been supportive as fuck, but she's starting to get frustrated too with my constant grouchiness. The worst part is I realize that it's temporary, but I'm scared of losing her. We've spoken about this and she assures me that she's willing to wait it out, but I'm afraid to risk it denting the relationship. 

This is my third attempt this year and both the previous attempts were stalled because I was constantly snapping at her and we would constantly get into fights. Once I'd get back to smoking, things would get peachy overnight. 

I REALLY don't want to start smoking again, but I really don't want to risk losing the most perfect woman I've ever met in my life. And this is just adding to the sadness, depression, anxiety and grumpiness. 

Fucking HELP!

Not addicted but having urges, any help?

I'm not addicted to smoking, but I don't want to become addicted. I've started smoking more frequently after moving away from home into my own place. On average I maybe smoke 2 a day or a pack in a weekend. I do get an urge of wanting to smoke to get through boredom but when I'm seeing family I can easily not smoke because they don't know I do and I don't want them to know.

Can anyone offer advice to fight urges and stop myself becoming addicted?

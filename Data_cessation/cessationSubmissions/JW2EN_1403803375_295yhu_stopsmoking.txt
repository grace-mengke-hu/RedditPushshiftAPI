Hi almost into day 5 of being smoke free, and I'm miserable.

I don't crave for a cigarette at all and I only think about it once every few hours(I am surprised) but I just feel sad. I can't focus on anything and it feels like everything is a blank. I feel like I've lost my direction in life and my motivation to push for my goals. Any ideas on how I can stop this bullshit? I just do nothing but go to school to daydream and come home and be a couch potato, this is extremely depressing.

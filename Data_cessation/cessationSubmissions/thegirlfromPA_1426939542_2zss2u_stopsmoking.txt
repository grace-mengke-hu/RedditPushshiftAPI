How the hell did I ever AFFORD to smoke?

I was a heavy (2 pk a day) smoker... around $13 a day. Now that I am clean for almost 19 days, I can't seem to put away $13 a day for the life of me. I always find a bill that needs to be paid or something that needs to be bought for the house or kids. I think it's so odd... I never went without cigarettes... so how did I finance my habit? This month is the month of birthdays in my house. All 3 of my kids have their cake day in March, so I know that is partly why I don't have the extra money this month... gifts and outings and all. In fact, their birthdays this month are what gave me the final push to quit now. I had been trying since last Fall... but this time I am making sure it sticks. After I get through this month, I am going to put $100 away each month. To fund Christmas this year. I was spending almost $400 a month in cigarettes, so you would think I wouldn't even notice $100...

Yes, friends, I am babbling. I know... it's what I do instead of smoking when I have a tough craving. :)

Who here is putting away their former cigarette money? How are you doing it?

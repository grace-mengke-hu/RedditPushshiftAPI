I want to quit!

Hello everyone! Im 21 f and today Im starting my journey of not smoking. My first cigarette was when I was 13-14 years old. I smoked for 5years and 2 years ago stopped. Recently I got diagnosed woth depression and one time, when I was feeling super sad and bored, I smoked a cigarette. It escalated to 2 weeks of smoking. I want to go back to non-smoker me. Im about one hour smoke free and Im really scared of craveings. I dont want to mess this up again. I would be really dissapointed in myself. Please, hold me accountable! Someone, can you tell me how you quit and how was your first days?

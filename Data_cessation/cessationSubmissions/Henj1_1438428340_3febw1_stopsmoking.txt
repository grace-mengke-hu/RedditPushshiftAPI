Hoarse voice and chronic cough

Has anyone else experienced this since quitting I am coughing all the time and trying to clear my throat! My voice is always strained and i find it hard to be heard clearly.. I hope this goes I havnt smoked for 2 weeks. Iv only smoked for around 6 years and I'm in my twenties so I'm assuming it will eventually go. Anyone else had problems with there voice?

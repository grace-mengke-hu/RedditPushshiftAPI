remain a non-smoker after a break-up

35 days as a non-smoker and going strong!

The reason to why i stopped smoking in the first place was that my boyfriend hated it and complained about it all the time and after have read Allen Carr's Easyway i smoked my last cigarette and haven't had much cravings since. However, don't get me wrong, it's nothing like the book says it will be, it's not 'easy', but i can handle the urge. 

Unfortunately it has come to a stage where i don't know if things will work out with my boyfriend, i'm no longer happy in the relationship (hoping it's not the lack of cigarettes causing the feeling). I'm thinking that we need a break, but the fear of going back to smoking stops me from it. Since i know i probably will be completely heartbroken and him being the main reason to why i stopped in the first place, i am not too sure i will be strong enough to resist! 

Its such a mess! Any advice would be highly appreciated!

How long for a 3 month smoker to recover back to normal?

Hello guys i was a 3 month smoker these last 3 months meaning that i never touched a cigarette in my whole life but only these 3 months.
I became a smoker and smoked around 1-5 cigarettes a day for these 3 months. Now I actually found out its not really "my thing" and i wanna quit.
How long will it take to recover from these 3 stupid months?

Quick facts. 
I'm 18. Never smoked in my life. Only these 3 months i have been smoking cigarettes.

Thanks alot

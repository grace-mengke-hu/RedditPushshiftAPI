2 weeks without smoking: When will this cough end!

I have been smoking for 10 years, and for the first time ever I am 2 weeks without it. I developed a terrible cough when I quit and my lungs feel like they are in a very bad condition. They feel like they don't stay open for long or something like that. I want to know if anyone else has had this and if so when it went away. 

I went to a doctor about it even and they said I am fine and just to wait until it goes away.

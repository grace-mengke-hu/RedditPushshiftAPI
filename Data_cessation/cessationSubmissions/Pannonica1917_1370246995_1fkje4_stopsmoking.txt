today's the day, got some gum and this quit pro app on my phone. worst part is going to be after lunch i think. wish me luck!

I've been building up to this day for about a week now, and i've been reading a lot of stuff on /r/stopsmoking, so i actually feel pretty well prepared. thanks to all posters on here for asking good questions and giving good answers! now i just watch [this japanese fisherman](http://youtu.be/KxGRhd_iWuE) for encouragement.

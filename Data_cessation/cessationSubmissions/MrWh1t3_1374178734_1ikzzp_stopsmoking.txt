I've had my mind wrapped around quitting for good over the last couple of months, but I really need help.

I'm sure that most, if not all, of you have felt before have had the random excuse of not quitting. Mine is being in the military. Four years in the Air Force while going through some highly stressful times hasn't been a helpful sign from the hypnotoad to quit.

Before I get to far into that little sob-story, I just want to get this one thing out of the way: I will not go on Chantix. I'm just not right enough up there to do it.

I really wanted to clean up my act and save me some more money. First I quit the energy drinks, then I decided to stop drinking. My quit day is this upcoming Monday for that. I put it in my mind that I was going to quit, and I was going to quit for good on the 20th of September (Four months after I decided to quit drinking energy drinks). I really don't want to wait that long, because honestly, the four years of smoking 30+/day are really catching up with me. I want to live clean, and I really more than anything want to find more out about places than where I can smoke.

I need your help guys. I want to think I'm ready for this.

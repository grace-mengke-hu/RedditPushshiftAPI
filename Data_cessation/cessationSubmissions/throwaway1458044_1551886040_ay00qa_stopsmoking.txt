I started smoking out of spite of my abusive ex, and I don’t know how to stop.

Advice needed. First time poster long time lurker. Throwaway acc. etc etc.

When I was a teenager, I was in a toxic, emotionally and sexually abusive relationship. My ex at the time hated smokers, smoking, anything to do with cigarettes.

Towards the end of our relationship, the abuse just became worse and worse until it was unbearable. I started to smoke (in secret) just to spite him (we were in a long distance relationship at that point). Eventually, I broke up with him and cut all contact, but the habit of smoking out of spite stuck with me til this day. It’s been almost 8 years.

I began smoking more and more frequently, just as a coping mechanism to feel some sort of control over my life. I managed to quit for a few months early last year, but recently relapsed again and can’t seem to stop. I’m not a social smoker, I only ever smoke in secret, but due to health reasons I know it’s best for me to stop.

I’ve tried to regain control through going to the gym, cooking more often, seeing a therapist, hell, I’ve tried it all. But nothing gives me quite the same kind of instant relief that I feel when I smoke. It feels like just with one cigarette, I’ve got control over my life and my feelings again. One turns into two, and two to three, etc. 

I feel like I need this. I can’t bring myself to give it up because I feel like I have so little control over my life. I need to smoke to get my exe’s voice out of my head, to feel like I’m defying everything he’s said or done to me. I can’t bring myself to quit because I feel like, in some way, if I did I’d be submitting myself to the past again and he was right. Every time I’ve tried to quit, his voice comes back and distresses me so much that I NEED to smoke just to get him out of my head.

I don’t know what to do. I need to quit for health reasons, and I don’t want to smoke forever. I just don’t know how to stop.

Please help.

I dont want to repeat my last slip

I'm really having a moment of panic. I've re-read Allen Carr and am not going to get smokes but I feel crappy and weak and scared? I've quit before where I end up buying a pack and smoking a few... going some days... repeat and ... blah blah... then back to smoking.... how can I get 2 - 3 - 4 WEEKS in? without this terrible torture at moments?

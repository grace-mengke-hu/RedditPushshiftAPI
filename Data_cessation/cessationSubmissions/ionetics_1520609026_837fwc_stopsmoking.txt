11 days and crazy

I'm on Champix and had last puff on a cig 11 days ago. Ditched the vape 3 days ago too (lowdose 3mg juice, used twice daily for 3 days), partly under the influence of Allen Carr. 


Starting before ditching the homeopathic vape, but worse since then, my emotional reactions have been ridiculous! Thank God I work from home, because I've been crying at any and everything. 


I cry when I hear either a sad or happy song, when I think of any loved one, dead or alive, because I love them so much. I cry when my SmokeFree app sends me a tappytoes dog .gif after I complete a motivational exercise. 


And I've been sooo f-ing snippy with my dear partner (an ex-smoker who quit 200 times before his final one 2 yrs ago) just because he's here and available. Luckily, he was homicidal when he last stopped smoking 2 yrs ago on an island Buddhist retreat with no shop, so has been extremely tolerant of my madness.


My question is, is this ridiculous emotionalism the nicotine withdrawal or the Champix? Should I stop the Champix to try to delineate this? And will I be able to hold a conversation without weeping sometime soon?

BTW- I have not cracked on taking a puff, a vape or an NRT lozenge in 3 days, and really don't want to either. Smoked non-stop for 38 years before this quit- only serious previous quit was 3 days, again with Champix, but nowhere near as nutzoid then.


Thanks for listening. Writing it out helps.

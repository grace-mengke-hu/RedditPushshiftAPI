this weekend marks 6 months smoke free for me!

hi all, 

i smoked for 8 years. at my worst, i smoked 2 packs a day for about 2 of those years. this past summer, i knew it had to stop. why, oh why, would i continue to do something that was *literally killing me*? 

september 1st, i quit cold turkey. never looked back. i passed all the 'tests' (times i knew it would be really hard to resist) aka, being drunk at a party, being around smoking friends, etc. 

i know quitting is very different case to case, but things that helped for me were:

* telling yourself you **can't have something EVER again**, often times can make you want it even more. so i would tell myself, "yeah, sure, i can have one. but i don't *want* one." this got easier and easier over time. 

* run through all the health risks to remind yourself what you are doing to your body. i got an app on my smartphone which shows how my health has improved since quitting and how much money and time i've saved. 


* lastly, financial reasons. think about working hard for your money, to pay rent/bills/etc. why do you want to just give all that money to tobacco companies that *don't give a single fuck about you*? think about all the awesome stuff you can do with the money you'll save.


As a 6 month reward to myself, i'm going to Philly for the weekend!


good luck out there everyone, i know it can be tough.

Just quit 2 addictions. Wish me luck

~~I don't know how to get flair saying how long ago I quit but no matter.~~ About an hour ago, I broke my last 4 cigarettes and poured out my last 4 beers (the fact that there were 4 of each wasn't planned, just coincidence). Friends have told me not to try both at once but for me the habits are hugely interrelated so this seemed to be the only way to avoid a chicken/egg scenario.

I spent this week reading the Allen Carr book. There was a lot of good info but I'm not sure I buy 100% of his ideas. Regardless, there are enough solid take-aways that I think it'll help me out a lot.

My spouse is out of town with the kids for a while. My first thought was: single life and over indulgence. But I realized that I'm not going to get another opportunity like this again where I can even go though some withdrawal alone if needed: so I bit the bullet. Also, my spouse's birthday is in a few days so all the stars are aligned as it were.

The stars being aligned has a dark side though: I feel tremendous pressure to succeed. I've been smoking a bloody long time and have quit many times only to relapse. So many things have aligned this week which will probably never happen again. If I can't do it this time, with so much in my favor, the future looks grim. Again: tremendous pressure.

Wish me luck!

One cig every now and then?

Im in my early 20's and have been smoking for ~11 months, I tend to quit smoking for a bit then smoke purely because I enjoy the high I get and use it to control my hunger, and I admit sometimes I smoke more.

question here is, is it even possible for me to control my smoking if I allow myself a cig every now and then (say one a day or so) can it really hurt me that much?

I do workout and eat healthy btw and since im losing weight I use smoking as a way to inhibit hunger. (thats why I got into it)

Right now ive justified it to myself. Like I dont think im at risk if I limit the smoking for once a day or only when I feel really hungry but already reached my caloric intake. How bad is this? cant be same as smoking a pack a day, right?

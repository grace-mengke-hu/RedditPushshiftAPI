Day 5...?

I got really drunk Saturday night and smoked half a cigarette.  Would I be on day 5 or day 2 thanks to my fuck up? It was the only one I had since my last one. I learned from it... I won't be going out for awhile until I get used to not smoking. Not trying to justify or atone for what I've done, just wondering what the correct etiquette is in regards to what I should trek people about how far I've come (albeit is isn't very far either way).

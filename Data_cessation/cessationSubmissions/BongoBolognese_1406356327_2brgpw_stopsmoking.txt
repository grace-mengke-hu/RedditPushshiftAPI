Is it just me or do you get stuff done without smoking?

Over the last weeks I noticed a lot of positive effects about being a non-smoker, but there is one thing that amazes me.

I always considered myself as lazy. I mean I have a master's degree and such, but I always found it hard to keep my appartment tidy, keep track of those damn bills and paying them on time, sticking to deadlines at university and so on. I am now smoke-free for 20 days and my life is in order as it never was before. I get shit done! My appartment is tidy, all my bills are well organized and so on. I am not lazy, at least I wasn't over the last week.

Have one of you realized something like that? Is it just a phase to distract oneself from the hard time at the beginning of quit smoking or is it something that stays? If so, how can this happen?

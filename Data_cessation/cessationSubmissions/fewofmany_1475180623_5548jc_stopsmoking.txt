What should I expect when the patches run out?

Hey. I've posted here before. My previous three attempts to quit failed before I decided Cold Turkey wasn't gonna work for me. A couple weeks ago I started on nicotine patches. I did the wrong thing and still occasionally smoked, though less and less, until finally, yesterday, I made it through my first day without a cigarette in a year and a half or so. Today seems a little easier, though that might be in my head.

I've got a couple weeks worth of these left and I'm pretty confident I can avoid cigarettes that long, but I'm worried about what to expect when they run out. Is the first day off the patch comparable to the first day of cold turkey?

Day 43 - what is going on...

So I have been 43 days free. I am very happy about that, especially since the pressure of not having to say "I quit" on January 1st once again. Physically it's going very well, breathing feels easier and my sense of smell is noticeably increased. Especially in the last 10 days or so I feel like my body is really "rejuvenating" (wrong spelling), my skin is changing as well.

However, since about day 40/41 my mental state has really dipped for no apparent reason. I had increased cravings, I know Im not going back to smoking so they didn't bother me so much in general. It seems like a lot of people experience this after multiple weeks of quitting, I saw it described here before. They say it's "the dying addictions last attempt" or something to that affect. 

Long story short, Im fidgeting, I have no attention span whatsoever, I have difficulties recalling stuff I tried to memorize a day before and I feel dull/sad for no reason. (I wrote "know" instead of "no", I do things like that all day now). 

You can probably tell what Im talking about by how rambly and all-over this post is. I hope this goes away ASAP as I have exams coming up.

Good luck to all the New Year's quitters ! This was the week I failed last attempt

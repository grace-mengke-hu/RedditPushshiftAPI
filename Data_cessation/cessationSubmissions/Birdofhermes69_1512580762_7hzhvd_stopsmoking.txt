I keep finding ways to convince myself to light up.

Certainly a normal problem. there were times I have been smoke free, for long times, since my initial addiction, but it was a lower stress. Though not a better time. I dont know if it's just a lack of willpower or setting, habitual negative Self-Talk or otherwise. I keep the lie about next time going. But I remember that feeling of quitting and how happy I was and how much better my quality of life was. Any comments about your own struggles will be helpful.

"Only by resolving can a human being step into actuality, however bitter this may be to him. Inertia lacks the will to abandon the inward brooding which allows it to retain everything as as a possibility. But possibility is not yet actuality."

G.W.F. Hegel

My lungs HURT!

God damn it! I am so fucking sick of having to suck in this vaporized tar all day!

I smoke, a lot. I spend about 15% of my income, after taxes, on cigarettes and pipe tobacco.

Usually I go through a 20 pack of cigarettes, the strong kinds with high tar and nicotine levels, before dinner. After dinner I start the pipe smoking, and I pack the pipe 4-5 times before bed. I smoke each packing 3-4 times. So in total I smoke on average 30-40 times each day.

I want to quit so badly, after pretty much every time I have had a smoke. Then, half an hour later everything is forgotten and the urge to smoke is overwhelming and makes me smoke again.


AGrh.. my lungs hurt so fucking bad these days. I cough up things that look like snot, like dried mucus, several times a day. Have done this for years.

Why do I do this?

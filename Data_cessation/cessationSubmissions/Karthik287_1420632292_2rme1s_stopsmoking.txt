I wish I could say I feel a lot better and a lot healthier. Besides the slight increase in my sense of taste I dont feel a whole lot different. When I wake up in the morning after 7-8hrs of sleep(That is 1-2 more hrs than I usually get) I still feel tired. My stomach has been in knots since day 3 and so has my sinus. I've been getting headaches because of sinus since day 3 as well. Dont know if its related but i'm gonna go see a physician about it. I'm in two minds of just strolling down the road and buying a pack.

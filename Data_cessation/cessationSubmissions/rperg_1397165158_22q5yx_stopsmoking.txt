One Week

Hey All. I'm new to this sub, but I'm so happy I found it. I need a group that is going through the same thing I am, and to hear success stories. 

I have been smoking for 13yrs, and I'm currently 25. I tried quitting countless times, all to no avail. I recently tried Bupropion, but couldn't take it for more than a couple days. It had the oddest effect on me. It caused me to be in a constant fog, but also made me think a lot more clearly. It somehow makes you think a lot deeper about things.

This kind of got the ball rolling on my most recent quitting attempt. I realized that I can't trick myself into quitting like I have in the past (run out of cigarettes, see how long I can go without caving). Rather you need to feel a motivation to quit and understand that smoking is awful for you.I smoked because I didn't care. It completely controlled me. I am sick of that life and want to feel energetic again. I have lasted months before, but this time feels completely different than the others. I finally realized that I need to quit.

With that being said, I am one week in, and feel no urge to continue the habit.

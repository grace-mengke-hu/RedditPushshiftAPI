It's always the same, I can't get past the evening.

So I've been trying to quit for about 2 weeks now and still stuck on the first day. I do pretty well on daytime but once it gets about 6pm I fail. Every single time. I've tried different approaches, read books about quitting including allen carrs. I tried sleeping little so I am tired in the evening, but I don't want to sleep until I get the cigarette. I tried to surpress my urges by playing video games, but eventually I stop playing and then smoke. It all just doesn't work. 

Even though I know I feel better when I don't smoke. I know that it is a drug addiction, that it will get better. And yet I still smoke. always in the evening. You would think that I would give up, giving up. But no I am so fucking stubborn that I will try again, only to smoke in the evening again. 

What the fuck is going on ? Can someone help me please? It's so simple too. Just don't smoke, the urges are going to pass away the next day.

I feel like this will never end and it makes me crazy. Eventually I came to the conclusion that I actually don't wanna quit. But then again I just can't stop trying. 

If this keeps on, I think I'll end up completely crazy.

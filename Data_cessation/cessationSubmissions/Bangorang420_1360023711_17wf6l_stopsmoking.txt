One Month and I feel great!

So it has been one month since I quit smoking a I feel great! There is more money in my wallet and I have actually noticed that I breath a lot easier now, especially when I work out now! At this point if I can go a month I can go on forever without a smoke. Cheers to you all and the stories that I have read on here that have inspired me and helped me along my way.

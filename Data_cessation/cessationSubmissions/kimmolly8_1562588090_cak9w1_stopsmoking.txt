Walking to the gym while smoking

It feels redundant. Is what I'm doing at the gum even helping me because I'm smoking? I dont know.. but fuck it, I'm going to workout. Hopefully i will stop soon... I've smoked on and off for 8 years. The last time I quit was for 2 years. It's been a year and a half since then. Why can't I quit it? I can't even touch myself without being our of breath lol. I just realized this sub might exist, found you guys, and posted. Thanks for reading :)

I'm here again?

ugh... I'm here again. With cigarettes as my heartbroken friend. A failed love relationship... I know I feel better when I'm not smoking... why do i reach for them like this... I'm ready to stop this insanity... I need a new healthy vice... i'm trying to do yoga... now i have a headache... I need help and support... something else to soothe my broken achey heart...

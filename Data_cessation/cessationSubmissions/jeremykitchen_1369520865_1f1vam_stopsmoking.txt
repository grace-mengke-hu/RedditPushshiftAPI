really doing it this time

I'm currently between jobs and have a week off, so I figure why not quit smoking?

It saves me from the excuse of "oh I'll just be a total asshole at work on monday if I try to quit this weekend" because by the time I start my new job on jun 3 I'll be over the worst of the withdrawal symptoms. 

I can do it.

All it takes is a little willpower.

Also, I originally had this post titled "trying again today", which I realized was not the right title. I'm not TRYING to quit. I *AM* quitting.

Rawr. I hope to join you 1-year folks I see posted today next year!

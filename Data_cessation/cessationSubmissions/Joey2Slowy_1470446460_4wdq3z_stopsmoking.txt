Do the damn cravings ever chill?

10 days in, almost bummed one from someone today but fought it back, and it got me thinking.. Do the cravings ever really go away? I know I'm still very early in this process, but I'm worried I'll never feel like a normal person and will always have a lingering craving in the back of my mind.

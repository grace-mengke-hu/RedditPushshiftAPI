Quitting Tomorrow 28/3/18 + Any tips for hanging out with smoking friends?

Hello everyone!

So I've managed to quit successfully in the past, but I have a recurring problem when I go spend time with good friends that smoke. After a while I eventually cave, and once I've had an evening of smoking I find it very hard to shake. My friends don't encourage me to smoke or anything, but I think being in the presence of smokers makes me want to smoke too.

So does anyone have any tips for this situation?

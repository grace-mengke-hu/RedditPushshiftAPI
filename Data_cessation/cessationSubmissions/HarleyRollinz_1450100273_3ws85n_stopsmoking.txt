I've made my quit date, now I just need support! ðŸ˜œ

I've been reading a lot of your posts and just reading these helps. 
I've tried too quit before and I had  the right
Mindset but as always, I caved! Lol but this time I thought maybe if I join a group or something, im in contact with other people who are going through the same thing !  Any ideas for my last week?????ðŸ¤”

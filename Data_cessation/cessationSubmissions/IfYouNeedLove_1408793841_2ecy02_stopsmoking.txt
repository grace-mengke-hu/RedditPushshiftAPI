Can anyone share a Chantix/Champix (varenicline) experience?

Hey all! I just wanted to see if anyone has had any experience with this drug. I am on week 5 and haven't smoked since week 3. Apart from the nausea I think it really has helped with the quitting experience. If anyone has a story to share regarding varenicline that'd be awesome.

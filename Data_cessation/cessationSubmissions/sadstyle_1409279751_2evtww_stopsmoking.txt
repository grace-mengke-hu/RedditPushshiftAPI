Feeling too emotional and starting to doubt if I can stay quit.

I don't know where this is coming from. The first 2 weeks were pretty much a smooth sail in terms of withdrawal and cravings and everything was fine in general. But for the past week I have been feeling too emotional, think uncontrollable crying and anxiety (external factors play a part), and started to think about how I want to smoke because it will "help" and that I shouldn't have quit because I *will* get back to it. I don't know how to describe the feeling, but it's like "I don't need to smoke but I feel like I really need to." To make things worse, I had several dreams where I was rolling the tobacco and smoking like the quit never happened. They felt and looked so real like my brain's getting back at me for all of this.

Next week I will be flying back to my place (I'm currently at my parent's). This is a repeat of last year when I quit. After coming back from visiting my parents, it was a week later that I picked it up again. I'm worried this is what will happen in 1-2 weeks. I have this awful feeling in my stomach that I am not strong enough to stay away from it.

Is this the rationalisation part? There's no nicotine in my system for a while now so it's not physical. I guess the next battle (mental) is due to start. How do I approach this?

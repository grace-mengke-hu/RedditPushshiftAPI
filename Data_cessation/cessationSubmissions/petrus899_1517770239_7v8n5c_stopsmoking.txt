Trying to quit...

Sorry if this post seems a bit trite, but I wanted to get any helpful suggestions you all may have regarding quitting for good. 

I’ve been an on/off smoker for about the last 7 years. Typically, I’ll smoke 1-2 cigs a day to help curb the stress I experience at work (I provide therapy to adults with severe schizophrenia). I lead a relatively healthy lifestyle (I bike commute to work as often as I can and rock climb regularly), thus helping me justify that my smoking habit isn’t that big of a problem. 

I used to subscribe to the belief that I could quit anytime I wanted to, but found that even when I throw away a pack of smokes, I eventually go out and by a new one later that day. I hate feeling out of control with this, and want to break this cycle. The ironic thing is, I just smoked a cig before writing this, and feel like a complete dumbass. I have a pack of cigs in my car at the moment, and am tempted to just throw it out, but I’m afraid I’ll justify buying another pack on my way home after I’m off work today. 

Have any of you guys experienced a similar situation (throwing packs out only to buy a new one hours later)? 

tl;dr I’m trying to quit smoking for good and don’t really have a clue where to start.

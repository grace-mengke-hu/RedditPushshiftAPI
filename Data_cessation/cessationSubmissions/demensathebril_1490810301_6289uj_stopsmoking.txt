111... It's my lucky day :)

Just can't wait for 1111.

I'm so fucking proud of myself for making it this far. It's really pushed me to my limits and I'm starting to realize my potential in a lot of things.

Stick with it y'all.

For me, telling anyone and everyone who would listen about my quitting, my cravings, and how many days I had under my belt kept me accountable and helped me reach out for support.

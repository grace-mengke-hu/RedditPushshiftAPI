I can't do it for me, but I think I can for my son.

I have been smoking for nearly 13 years, I've quit a few times but always gone back because of working in kitchens. At 23 I had finally decided that I wouldn't be able to quit, just like dad. Even after watching him die in a hospital bed (most likely from smoking and never exercising) I just wasn't able to stay quit.

I have never smoked near my son, I go outside to do it, but every time I hear him cough for any reason I assume it's my fault and just have these terrible pains from guilt. I have to do it not just for his health, but so I can be around and able to do stuff with him, and eventually his kids. 

I just smoked my last one before posting this, and I'm feeling more confident about this than I have anything for a long while.
 
I got this.

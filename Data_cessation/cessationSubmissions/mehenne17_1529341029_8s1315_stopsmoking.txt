Having trouble quitting e-cigarettes?

Hello my name is Meredith.   I am a current graduate student seeking my Masters in Public Health. I have been recently fascinated about the use of e -cigarettes in our young adult population (ages 22-30). I am reaching out to my fellow reddit users to obtain more information about e-cigarettes. I plan to develop an online platform for individuals who are seeking assistance in quitting e-cigarette use. Does anyone think that an online platform would be useful for support and information in quitting e-cigarette use? Would an online platform be more beneficial to seeking assistance rather than in person?

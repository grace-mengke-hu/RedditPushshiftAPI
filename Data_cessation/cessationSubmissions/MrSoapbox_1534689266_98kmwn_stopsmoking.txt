I'm so skeptical of Vaping.

I _really_ want to quit smoking, but it's hard (obviously, as you know) more so through a lot of reasons I'd rather not disclose on reddit, which aren't helping things. 

Gum just does not work. Patches are "okay" but expensive but the main problem with them is they won't stick, I've tried many types but they always fall off a few hours later. Lozenges give me a really bad throat. 

I've got some champax (a pill) but I haven't started them yet, I hear they can really cause depression and I'm already struggling with that as it is, and to top it off my step mother died last week so I was holding off a while before trying them. 

I tried vaping once briefly, but the pen wasn't so good, didn't give much smoke so didn't get "that" feeling it was doing anything, but I've always been skeptical of buying an expensive pen. I know it might just help and I've heard all the arguments that "it can't be as bad as tobacco" but yeah, we just don't know. They've only been around a decade, probably half that of heavy use and obviously lung cancer is a horrible disease but I wonder if something new, much worse will crop up in 10 years for vapers. Truth is, we just don't know the long term damage. 

I feel like vaping is the only chance I got if these pills don't work, I can't afford patches if I have to replace them every 2-3 hours (I've even tried....duct tape :(  but it's not feasible :p) 

Does anyone feel the same with vaping? Do you just ignore the unknown and do it anyway? I feel a little lost with it.

Learning to deal with stress

For 14 years of my life, I've been dealing with stress by smoking.  39 days ago that stopped.  Lately I've been struggling with dealing with stress and anxiety.  So, today I decided that I am going to do something that I have always wanted to do but was too afraid to do (mainly because of the fact that I was a smoker and I was afraid of being judged).  I am starting yoga this evening.  

Have any of you started yoga?  What's your experience?  Am I hoping for too much when I hope that this will help me de-stress?

Is having a quit date a bad idea? Young girl needing advice

So I've decided to choose a date to quit smoking. It's a bit far away though. I find myself not ready to commit right now because of all the events going on this summer, but I can't see myself continuing smoking long-term. 

I've been smoking half a pack to a whole pack a day steadily for a year and a half now, I'm 19, and I've decided that this doesn't have to be my whole life. 

My quit day is November 1st. I need advice. Is this a bad idea to have a quit date so far away? How has it worked for you guys?

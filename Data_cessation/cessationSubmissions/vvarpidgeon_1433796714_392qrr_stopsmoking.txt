Anybody else feel worse after quitting?

I'm 45+ days in to quitting cold turkey and I wake up every morning feeling like I spent the previous night chain smoking.  It goes away as the day goes on then it happens again the next morning.  Anybody else experience this when they quit?  Should I go see a doctor?

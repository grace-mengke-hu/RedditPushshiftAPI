Floating away..

My mouth stays so dry, I drink lots of water but it's like I am dehydrated. Seriously, I drink so much water that I'm scared to venture where there is no restroom, my bladder is on overdrive. My throat still feels scratchy and raw but I'm not coughing much at all. 

Anyone else have a similar problem? I am 17 days quit today and feeling stronger every day!!

Had another awesome realisation last night.

Even though it has been 187 days since I had a smoke I still felt like I missed it, and it was always in my head that I haven't quite beaten it. Well I was drinking with mates last night and as I was getting more drunk I mentioned I might have a smoke since a couple of them were puffing away. I was perfectly ok with this thought as I got over beating myself up for failing years ago but it just never happened, I didn't stop myself from smoking but I just didn't want a smoke, the urge didn't surface even though I was pretty drunk and they were accessible. 

I finally feel that I am no longer a smoker and it feels pretty good :)

Help Quitting

So, I've been a smoker for around 5 years which equates to all of my adult life. It doesn't sound like much, but as of know its around 20% of my time on earth I've been smoking cigarettes. As with everyone it started as something stupid (to look cool) but now I'm stuck with a stupid lingering habit. I smoke on average around 8-10 a day (more if I'm drinking or stressed). The hardest thing about quitting I've found is its not necessarily the cravings but its the want to do something else for five minutes. It's the stepping outside no matter what the weather and staring off into space thing while simultaneously calming down for five minutes that really just is the tits. But if that's five minutes a cigarette, 8 times a day, it's almost an hour for every day that I now have to fill with shit to do to keep my mind off of smoking. I was wondering if any of you guys have had the same problem and what you guys did to fill the gaps. 

tl;dr need activities for the five minute breaks

I'm on day 20. What worked for me?

I want to give some advice to beginners:

- not one more puff. It can seem obvious, but please, never accept another cigarette or another puff. Nicotine is bastard and makes all your effort going into ashes. Remember it, even after 1 year a puff can make you smoking again.

- Eat sweet things: counter nicotine addiction with chocolate or others. It worked for me. And the taste of chocolate is far better than taste of smoke.

- Give yourself another routine: in my home it was easy to do this. Instead of cigarettes, I study harder and at 5 pm I have a cup of tea with again something sweet, like biscuits or brioches.
I had more difficulties for the breaks at university.

- Surround with non - smokers and avoid smokers for the first about 10 days, as maybe the craving is too high. Nicotine is very strong, and it is tough even if you are stronger.
Then you must try to be with smokers without sharing their habit: you can't make your quitting a reason to withdraw from friends!

- Challenge yourself: who is stronger? You or nicotine? You are stronger, prove it.
But NEVER judge yourself for a craving. You must realize that it is not what you really want. My worst craving (a 10/10) lasted only 5/10 minutes. No more.

- Download an app: like every war, a good allied can male the difference between victory and defeat. I use Smoke Free Beta.

- Start your quitting path only if you are extremely determinated. In 19 days I had a lot of cravings.

Notice that I do not mention to tell it to other people or not. That is only your affair: it can help or you can care nothing. As for me, I usually care but sometimes I do not.
So the "social pressure" sometimes works and sometimes doesn't.

Good luck guys. I hope it will come handy.
But it won't make things easier at all. Hard times are for everyone.

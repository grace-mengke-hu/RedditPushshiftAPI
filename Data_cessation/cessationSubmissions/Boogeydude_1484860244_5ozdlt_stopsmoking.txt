47 Days. This past week has been awful.

I've gone 47 days without a cigarette and have honestly had little to no cravings this entire time.
However, this past week has been awful - I've been really irritable and I'm having periods of shortness of breath.
Anyone else experience these things a little under two months of being cigarette free?

What am I so scared of? Just 24 hours. 

I keep stumbling. I can't seem to make it past three days. I really want to. My Mom, the very nice lady she is, bought me two packs while I was home. I am so tired of being a slave to this addiction. I want to stop replacing my badge! I want to keep it and be proud of myself! I think it can be as easy as that. I want so much to believe in myself. I am feeling a little defeated...by myself no less. All I have to do is make through tomorrow. Just 24 hours. I can do it.

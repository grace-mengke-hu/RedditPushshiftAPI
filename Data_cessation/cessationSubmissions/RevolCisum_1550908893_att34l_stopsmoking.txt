83 Days and improvements

Almost to day 84.  Tonight, I was brushing my teeth, and I cannot believe how much plumper and healthy the skin on my face looks!  I had cystic acne at age 35 due to hormonal issues, and it left scarring on my face.  I have been terribly self conscious about it bc it looked so awful.  But tonight, I noticed it looks so much better.  Far less noticeable.  The plumpness hides a lot of it, and the color of my skin is so much better!  

I have been able to do this quit with no weight gain, by using lozenges.  So, the fact that I haven't gained 50 pounds like I did last quit, and how much better my skin looks, are both really motivating me!

I'm not feeling tons better yet, but I smoked for 25 years, so I'm sure it will take time.  

So for those of you who aren't this far along, hang in there!  It's worth it!  You will see improvements in time, and be so glad you stuck it out!  It hasn't been easy, but every time I look at my total amount of days, I am so glad to former me for not giving up!

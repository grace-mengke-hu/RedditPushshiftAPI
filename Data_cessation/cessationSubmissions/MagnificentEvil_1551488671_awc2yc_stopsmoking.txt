Yesterday was my second smokefree month

I just realized that i have passed my second month. I can say now that i do not have cravings anymore. It is quite stressful in my life right now and i didn't thought about smoking. I think i am starting to hate the smell of it. Just wanted to share this with someone :) gl guys

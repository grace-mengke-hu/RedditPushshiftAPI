9 Weeks in, I'm having a constant massive acid reflux in the past 2 weeks

Week 1 \- 2: I battled the physical addiction, had smoker's flu, was coughing like mad.

Week 3 \- 4: I battled the emotional addiction.

Week 5 \- 6: The craving subsided, it was much easier to manage triggers. My body felt much better. 

Week 7 \- 9 \(now\): I've been having difficult time sleeping, constantly feel the urge to belch/burp. Never had \(or aware\) acid reflux in my life, chest feel like burning, there is this feeling of something stuck in my throat. Life's been pretty hectic, the most stressful period in this year. 

Smoked for 6 months, smoked pretty casually for the first 3 months \(1 pack a month\), then the last 3 months I went full on addicted \(half a pack a day\), until I finally decided to quit.

Have anyone had this issue before? This is getting really annoying. I have multiple deadline in a few weeks time, and I need to be in shape to finish them. At this point, after what I've been through, I'm definitely positive that I won't have another drag anymore. 

I really, really need to keep my morning black coffee. I used to have my coffee and cigs every morning, I still keep that habit sans the cigs. I usually skip breakfast and will have late lunch around 2\-3pm? I've been gouging aluminum antacid in the past 3 weeks, it doesn't seem to help much. Anything I can do to make this go away, except, please, if i can keep my morning coffee.

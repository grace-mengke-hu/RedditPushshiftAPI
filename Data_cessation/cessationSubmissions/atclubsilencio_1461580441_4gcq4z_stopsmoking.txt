Round 2. Quit date, today at 10 am

I'm smoking my last cigs of the day and then no more. I realized, due to all my anxiety issues, that cutting out smoking would probably solve a lot of them. I know withdrawal is going to be hell, but the Smoke Free app is encouraging, and I've been through a lot worse (like beating alcoholism) so I'm pretty sure I can do that. I'm hoping my heart beat will return to regular, my blood pressure will go down, I'll have less acid reflux,  my panic/anxiety attacks will subside a bit, but that it's also not going to be easy. 

Any tips on the first week? What kind of symptoms should I expect both physically and mentally? I'm thinking every time I get a craving that instead of smoking I'll hit the gym or go on a walk. I have to believe in myself, but I'm fucking ready. 

If it gets TOO hard, as I'm really going through a hard time that could set off some triggers, then I MIGHT got o e-cigs, but really I don't want to validate the nicotine and want it out of my system entirely. 

Here we go.

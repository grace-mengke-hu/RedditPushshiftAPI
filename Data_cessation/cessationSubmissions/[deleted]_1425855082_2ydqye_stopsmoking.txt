dammit, i relapsed today

i was 4 days into my attempt to quit smoking today. i didnt sleep at all last night. i woke up today and there was 3/4ths of a cigarette in the ashtray outside of my backdoor(probably from my brother), i was having my morning coffee, and i fucking smoked the shit. do you guys count this as a full relapse? should i reset my badge or do you count relapse as buying a full pack? it tasted like shit and i didnt even finish the whole thing. also ive been noticing that my breath smells like shit in the morning when i wake up since ive quit. is this a common symptom of quitting or is my sense smell just coming back and ive just never noticed it before.

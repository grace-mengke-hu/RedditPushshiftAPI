Advice

Alright my boyfriend and I are to the point of being done with cigarettes they do absolutely nothing for us and are just a burden in our life, we understand this. My boyfriend and I have gone about two weeks without smoking but I slipped (he stayed strong but it was very very difficult) because literally EVERYONE in our circle of friends smokes. This includes our roommates. Has anyone been in this situation? If so what are some suggestions you have to cope with the social aspect of smoking?

1 year smoke free! Hang in there and don't stop trying.

Hi,

saw this subreddit trending and thought it was fitting that I got a message from QuitNow today, that I am smoke free for a year now.

My message to you: Just don't stop trying. I felt like I had done everything already. The "Carr"-Book, cold turkey, slow stop, reducing, oversmoking and puke-quitting.
I was ready to start hypnosis and I was really reluctant towards that idea, but I wanted to quit smoking so bad.

Then I got sick, realized that I still wanted to smoke and stopped on an impulse. Got the QuitNow app and started sucking on lollipops.

Now, whenever I have the urge to smoke, I get a lollipop (I always have a backup supply with me just in case) and I haven't had a smoke since. I also stopped doing anything related to smoking (shisha etc.) so I wouldn't substitute my smoking otherwise.

I felt really empty the first three days and if it would have stayed that way after a week I would have started again, but after a week I was back to being my normal, happy self.

My advice: Try a thousand different methods...maybe drinking a big glass of water when you get the urge to smoke works for you (didn't for me) or you are the person that stops after a countdown (didn't work for me) or maybe you are just like me and decide that lollipops and a long walk in stressful situations help just as much.

After 15 years of smoking and at least one attempt each year (sometimes 5 attempts) I urge you to not stop trying if you fail. Don't let that one cigarette stop you from stopping again.

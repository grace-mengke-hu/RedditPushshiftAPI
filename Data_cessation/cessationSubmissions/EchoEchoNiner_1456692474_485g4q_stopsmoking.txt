Starting over today. It has been a difficult year.

I was looking forward to 2016, but a lot of shit has been bringing me down. It started off okay - I had an excellent week after reading Allen Carr's book, then my grandfather passed away. He and I were pretty close, so it hasn't been easy on myself or my family. I relapsed in to smoking after 9 days and started drinking more than usual (not necessarily a problem, but it has put me in situations where I want to chain smoke). The girl that I have been seeing and truly falling in love with moved out of the country for a job, and she really helped me fight the urge to smoke. I started smoking regularly since then and haven't quit.

Fast forward to last night. I went out last night with the gang reuniting after a few of us were  traveling for a couple years and we all smoke. I started smoking like a fiend even before the liquor hit me. I probably smoked an entire pack to myself. The only time I didn't have a cigarette in my hand was when I was in the pisser. This is normal for us. Everyone else I was with was puffing away incessantly too. 

On top of a Top 10 hangover, I can't fucking breathe today. When I woke up this morning I was basically gasping for the first hour I was awake. My hangover has mostly subsided thanks to coconut water and greasy food, but my chest and sinuses feel like absolute garbage. This has happened before, although I realized that I did this AGAIN despite telling myself in early January that I would never smoke in the future.

As of now I am breaking myself of the tyranny of addiction and breaking my chains. I cannot live like this anymore. I won't live long if I continue to do so.

I pledge to myself that I am done forever. Today marks the beginning of a new, healthier, and more vibrant chapter. I will need help and I will struggle, but I know that I can do this.

Thank you for reading.

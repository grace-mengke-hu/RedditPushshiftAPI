Freedom

Today, is the first day without a cigarette. I've tried this many of times, I once made it four months. But today is different. Today, I have to quit. I have no choice. I want to do this for myself anyways, but today, I go visit my lawyer for a DWI I got on Tuesday, I can't afford it anymore. I can't afford drinking anymore, I can't afford smoking weed anymore. Now, is the time for me to be completely sober...cigarette free. Start having an extra 6 dollars in my pocket everyday, so I can pass it over to my lawyer.

Badge reset :c

I frown but its for the best.  I have been working on other stuff over at /r/stopdrinking and am feeling pretty good about that side of things right now, so I am putting down the smokes.  I am looking at the 119 days on my badge and I know that its a lie, I maybe lasted 2 days.  I am going to use the Nicorette lozenges because cold turkey just isn't going to happen.  Wish me luck guys, this is big.  22 years later I am going to stop.

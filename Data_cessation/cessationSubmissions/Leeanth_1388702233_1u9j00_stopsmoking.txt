"Excuses" for caving...

I just answered another post and thought it might be helpful if those of us who have stopped smoking can tell the new quitters about all of the creative excuses we've come up with for having "just one more".

Mine:

**I once went to a mass stop-smoking session. The following day, around lunchtime, I took a work break and walked around the block. I worked in the CBD. Halfway through my walk, I bought a pack of ciggies and lit one up.** 

My reason: I could smell again and the world stank.



**I did a hypnotherapy session years ago. The "therapist" just put on a tape recording. I was angry afterwards, particularly as he'd charged me a lot of money. My anger grew over the next day.**

Reason for starting again: My kids begged me to have a cigarette, so I obliged them.


**One of my lungs collapsed once (when I was lighting a cigarette, which I valiantly smoked not realising at the time what had happened). I had a tube in my lung for a week and was too scared to smoke.**

Reason for starting again: When they took the tube out of my chest at the end of a week, I was visited by a friend who was at the hospital for treatment for terminal lung cancer. He asked me to go outside for a smoke. My excuse is it would have been rude to refuse because he was dying.



**Used nicotine patches.**

Reason for starting again: I got palpitations. A doctor I didn't know said it was probably the patch (really, it had nothing to do with panic attacks)...





**I got one of those acupuncture ear thingees. It fell out when I was walking up the street after the expensive session.**

Reason for starting again: What's the point of wasting all that money on stop smoking stuff if it's just going to fail five minutes later?

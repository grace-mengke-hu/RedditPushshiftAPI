My Emergency Stop note worked last night

On my phone I have a note saved that was written after I relapsed the last time to myself pleading not to do it again.  I was getting bad cravings last night to the point that I was planning out going to buy a pack.  I was resolved to get them, I event thought I would read the note and it wouldn't change my mind.  Then I read it and came to my senses. 

Emergency stop

I absolutely feel like shit, totally exhausted and depressed right after and the next day. It's just not worth it, it's not worth this downside.  Go for a walk don't bring your wallet, the craving will pass.  I know you are rationalizing saying you don't care, you'll just go through the quitting process again.  That's flawed logic, just your brain trying to trick you.  Don't listen to it, you'll feel like shit if you give in, no matter what you're thinking, you're going to regret it after, I'm there right now.  I know you've probably been drinking, I'm your sober self talking to you.  You're not thinking clearly.  Get out, do something else, eat something, go for a walk, just don't give in.

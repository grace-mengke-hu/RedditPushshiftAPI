Bizarre

Gross too. Last night, week 1, I wolfed down a spoonful of peanut butter. It got lodged in my esophagus and made me hack. 
I got that awful taste in the back of my throat and up to my sinuses that Id get when I’d over done the cigs. It’s back this morning. 
Anyone else have this happen?  I’m using chantix 
It’s definitely making me wonder why I ever smoked. 
It’s gross but in a good way I guess. I thought everything would be clean by now.

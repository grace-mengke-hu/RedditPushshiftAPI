Is it true that you never get over the addicition...

I've heard, multiple times now, that "once a smoker, always a smoker". It's always going to be hard, you're always going to crave them...even years after you've quit. I'm trying to keep motivated, but this news is depressing. What can I expect 6mos, 1yr or 2yrs down the line?

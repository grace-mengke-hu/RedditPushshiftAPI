First 40 days...

Let's see... Breathing better, check!  can smell rain a few hours before it hits, check! coughing a lot less, check!

Though I'm still feeling more tired, despite a decent night's sleep.  Not sure if this is related to quitting smoking or the fact I quit drinking at the same time.  Definitely a change of lifestyle all around.

Back once again

Im sitting here feeling Nicotines evil grasp on me for the first time in 3 years. I decided to get a Juul a few weeks ago and use it during final exams. I Quit cigs cold turkey about 3 years ago. Ended up spending $80+ on juul pods those few weeks. Now I realize that I kind of just spiraled out of control again. Didn't think I'd have another day 1 but here I am. All it took was a few weeks of nicotine and I'm having withdrawals. Don't make the mistake of getting comfortable and assuming you can return to nicotine without consequence. Im confident now that I can never casually return to nicotine. I have to accept that nicotine will always put me at risk of relapse and can never have it.

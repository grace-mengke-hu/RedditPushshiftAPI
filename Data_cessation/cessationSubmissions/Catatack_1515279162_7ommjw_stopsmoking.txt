Five days in. Second time quitting. Constant cravings.

My first time I quit for a good three months over the summer and I was really proud of myself. Fell off the wagon after some pretty intense life stresses. Smoked like a chimney on NYE and decided enough was enough, I felt awful and disgusting and was ready to quit. I'm currently traveling out of town visiting relatives and didn't bring any cigarettes because I don't want my family to know I smoke, so the trip has helped me get over the first few days, but I feel like I'm having "future" cravings, if that makes sense? Like, "looking forward" to being home tomorrow so I can have a smoke, and I'm battling with myself trying to convince myself NOT to smoke tomorrow. I've been thinking about it for two days now and desperately trying to tell myself not to do it when I'm home. How am I supposed to fight this craving that is lasting me for DAYS? Help me!

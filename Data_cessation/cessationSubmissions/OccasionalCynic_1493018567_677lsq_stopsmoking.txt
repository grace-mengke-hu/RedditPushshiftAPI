45 Days - Finally feeling better

I smoked about a pack of cigarettes per day over a couple of years. Quit for almost 4 weeks in Dezember 2015. But back then I never got the feeling of ease of breath, never had more energy than as a smoker and problems to concentrate continued. At some point I slipped and became a full blown smoker again.

This March I quit again. And this time I kept going. And now, after 45 days, it finally feels easier to breathe and I can concentrate better. Energy levels are still quite low though and a sore throat persists. But I think I start sleeping better.

My point is the following: A lot of people promise you will feel better pretty quick after quitting smoking. Don't be disappointed if it takes longer for you. At some point you will feel better. Just stay strong and remind yourself during cravings: "In a couple of minutes this craving is over and I will be glad I didn't smoke".

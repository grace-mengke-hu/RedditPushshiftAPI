My experience quitting with a vaporizer (good)

I smoked since I was 20 years old now I'm 25. Close friends know I smoked a lot too. I suffered from textbook addiction. A bit over a month ago I bought myself a "e-cigarette" that would allow me to wean myself off of nicotine. That way I could reduce my chances of failure and reduce withdrawal symptoms. I have not smoked a single cigarette since but then you might say "hey you're still addicted to nicotine!". 

Yesterday I dropped my vape and the tank broke. I have not decided to replace it yet. I know that one day does not look like a big deal but to someone with an addiction it is. Back then the lack of cigarettes would give me anxiety and the first thing I would have done is replace it. Trust me on that, I would make sure it happen. I had no control over it. 

The lack of nicotine now only gives me tiny urges that are easy to control. I think I did it! I feel like I've gotten rid of at least most of my addiction. 

TL;DR: The vape "e-cigs" worked!

four days

Hi!

I'm just sitting at home on my fourth day smoke free trying to let a craving pass, and I don't want to overextend myself to a friend who's been talking me through my quit a lot the past couple weeks. So this is maybe just a catharsis post.

I started smoking when I was thirteen, went on and off for six years, and have been smoking a pack a day or more for the last nine years. No previous quit attempts that lasted more than a few hours.

I am also four and a half months sober after nine years of daily drinking and ten years of daily wake and baking. There have been some significant periods of heavy adderall and cocaine abuse.

The physical cravings aren't as bad as they were the first few days, but I still just feel like a DEEP LONGING to smoke. With all the shit I've quit this year though I know that's just my junkie brain being an asshole, but it's just so persistent. The all day of it is really really something else. I just don't want to be like my mom, who's been smoking for 50 years and always complaining about it. 'trying' to quit. I'm going to fucking do this come hell or high water.

Y'alls posts have been great to read. Thanks!

Quit day starts Wednesday

Im in the military and they offer programs to quit smoking.  Wednesday is the day i finally get the nicotine patches (the only thing that has ever gotten me to quit before).

My only question is has anyone ever heard of Zyban? Ive heard it takes the anxiety out of quitting, but i dont know anyone else who has used it

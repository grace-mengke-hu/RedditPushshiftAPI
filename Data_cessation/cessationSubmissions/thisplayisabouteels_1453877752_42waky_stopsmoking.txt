Slipped a few weeks ago, starting again right now

So had a bad day a few weeks ago, felt self-destructive and literally bought a package and smoked them all in like a few hours. Surprise surprise, after the spell passed I'm still smoking :/

Anyway, resetting my badge now (after a few perfunctory solo attempts that lasted a few hours). Ready to be back on the wagon, smoked my last like 2 minutes ago.

Just gotta keep my mind on how I felt a month in last time. These next few days are gonna suck.

P.S. Anyone craving a cigarette a month in - seriously, it does absolutely nothing. Feels like you're sucking disgusting smoke out of a blocked straw - without the nicotine addiction it's bloody awful. The only reason I kept going past the first drag was a kind of self-hatred thing. (And then after that, the nicotine addiction, obvs.) Not even talking about health or whatnot, it was just...unpleasant. No redeeming factors whatsoever. Stay clean :)

Went from six months cold turkey, to one week. I’m still proud of myself.

This board was monumental in my decision to quit all nicotine after eight years of pack a day/relentless vaping. I made it to six months and was amazed at how different the world felt without nicotine. There was no eyeballing my Vape to keep it within arms distance. No more “stepping out” as soon as i got to a bar in order to regulate my anxiety and cope with social situations. No more guilt of buying one, or two packs of cigarettes, knowing that money could be used to finance a car, a business, or just be used for personal enjoyment in any other part of life.

But something happened. I got comfortable. I had moved back home to the Midwest from the west coast and fell into comfort. Going out to the bar a couple nights a week with close friends, I found myself willing to “just smoke one”. And it was just one. Than next week it was two. Than it was just a pack at the bar/weekends. Than for two months I was a fiend again. White knuckling the urge to not go outside and finish that snipe in the freezing cold. Walking back inside with a feeling of collapse in my chest; smelling my fingers and realizing how I just showered and cleaned my teeth, but was immediately sabotaging all the time I spent doing so.

Time for action. I decided on my 28th birthday that enough was enough. I humored the idea of being a smoker again, and I did not like it. I was tired, anxious, and distracted. Before I picked it up, I was clear headed, happy, and productive. I cannot spend the rest of my young life, hurting myself.

So here I am again, one week cold turkey. I had some big shit happen this week. Some real stress. But I made it through. Thank you to everyone for inspiring me to keep pushing.

Trying to qut.

So, I recently went to the doctors (for strep throat) and he asked how much I smoked a day, usually a pack. Stressed out means more smoking.

A little history; I've been smoking since I was 12-13years old. I'm now 23. I have a special disease called Pyruvate Kinase (blood/iron deficiency) and i have high anxeity. As of recent I've had Strep throat (Type G) and smoking anything kills my throat.

As of today I bought a Vape Pen (nothing fancy, just a cheapie) and I'm praying that it helps me quit. I come here for help. I've done the nicotine gum, I flat out hate it. Infact, I hate gum in general. Never chewed it. I've tried the patches and that didn't work so this is my last option (that comes to mind)

Now here is a question for all the people who quit using Vape pens. Did it work like you wanted it to? What mg of nicotine did you start with? What flavour? How often do you Vape?

I not only want to quit to save my health, but also to save the money. My SO (not related to this story) has bronchitis and I feel like I don't help her by smoking in or around the house were we relax. I've tried smoking outside and it still gets her. 

Please give me feedback, stories, details, everything and anything. I really want to quit, but I don't want to throw money at Vape pens constantly.

Thank you for your time.

I quit three days ago. I'm using the patch. I want to punch the world in the face. I want a cigarette. Help.

Smoked a pack a day off and on since I was 21 (29 now). I've been "quitting" since January. I've made it to 3 weeks a couple times, that seems to be when I cave. Every time I relapse it happens sooner and sooner. I've been using the patch the whole time because it really does help, but I still can't do this on my own.

That feeling....

....when you wake up in the morning with a scratchy voice and you immediately think 'Did I have too many cigarettes yesterday?' and then you think ITS DEFINITELY NOT THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 11 YEARS!!!  IT'LL NEVER BE THAT AGAIN!!!

It's probably from the cigarette withdrawal.......all my sinus/lung tissues feel so raw, it was only a matter of time before my throat felt it too.  But it's the small victories that really make me stop and be so fucking pumped I'm no longer a smoker.

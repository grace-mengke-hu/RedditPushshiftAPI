Want to quit but need advice.

Hi everyone,

Sorry to submit a post that has probably been submitted so many times but... I've known I've needed to quit and wanted to quit for quite some time (started at 18, now 24, up to about 3/4 a pack a day). I recently went through a breakup, and smoking was one of our problems. He smoked too, but I smoked more, and he gave me a lot of guff for it.

I want to take this life changing experience as a chance to, well, change my life. I realize it's time. Part of me wants to do it as an indirect way to say "hey screw you- my life is better without you and now I'm happier and healthier" I fully understand spite isn't the best motivator... but does anyone have any tips on how to quit even when you're going through a rough patch?

I really want to quit but I've failed when I tried before. I feel like I'm in a place to make sweeping life changes to be a better person, and I would just really appreciate stories from people who have had similar experiences- of quitting when they're kind of down and out.

Thank you for any and all support.

Edit: I've also read Allan Carr's book and even though I think it's so, so helpful, it's been hard for the message to stick with me. It's been hard to adhere to his message when I'm feeling sad and I've associated being down with going outside to have a smoke to deal with the stress and return me to a normal place :(

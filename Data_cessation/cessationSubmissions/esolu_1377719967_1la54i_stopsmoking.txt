So I have a doctor's visit tomorrow - I'm nervous

I'm so excited to get healthy, and doing what I can to accomplish that.  But I have this gnawing fear that something will pop up that will prevent me from getting to where I want to be.

I don't want it to be that I quit too late.  I don't want to have irreversible damage that will mean I can't exercise like I want to.

I know at 38 it's more likely that I can undo a lot of what has been done.  But man, I fed myself sooooo much poison for sooo long that it is not irrational to think at some point the other shoe will drop :(

I just want to have the chance to fix my mistakes.... please?.....

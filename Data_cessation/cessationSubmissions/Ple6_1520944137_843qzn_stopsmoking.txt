My two cents. (9m)

For me, realising it was my own choice to quit was important, i knew it wasn't gonna be easy and i knew i wouldn't be able to do the first few days occupied by something i had to do. Stress is your worst enemy. Planning my last cigarette was imoportant too, knowing approximitaly the whole "detox route" and counting days made it easier for me to understand why i felt like i did and when. Sometimes i felt down and i didn't *believe* it was because of the nicotine, so i wanted nicotine for "release". (One way withdrawal will screw with your head). Read up on the psychological aspect of it to understand it better, make quitting a full blown task and prepare for the worst cause it'll come, but the positive benefits you'll recieve with time will be absolutely worth it. It's been 9 months and i never think of smoking anymore myself, but my mood gets down everytime i think of people stuck not being able to quit, cause it's such an unecessary.. evil thing.

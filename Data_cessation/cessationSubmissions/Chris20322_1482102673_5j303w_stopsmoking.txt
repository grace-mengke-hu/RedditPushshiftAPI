Need/Want to Stop

Hello all. 
Figured i would post a little something, been smoking off and on for the better part of 14 years. I recently quit drinking and it's been 7 1/2 months since I've had a drop. I thought this would make quitting smoking easier and it did for awhile. I wasn't smoking near as much as when drinking. Recently I've been smoking close to a pack every 2 or 3 days and I know if i can kick this it will be great for,my health.. I've bought a vape and it just doesnt seem to give the same satisfaction as a cigarette. Maybe its because i can't hold and smoke like a cigarette who knows. I've also lost quit a bit of weight since putting down the alcohol, but when smoking stops, eating becomes a habit. Any tips or tricks would be greatly appreciated. Have a good day!

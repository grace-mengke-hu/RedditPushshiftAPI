90 days! I should be celebrating..

But I'm struggling I broke up with my ex girlfriend and it's hard, I've been thinking about smoking today. I know it won't do me any good at all but still, I want one. If I prove to myself that I can get trough this without smoking I can take on everything I guess.
Good luck on your quitting! :)

Ugh - I'm so nervous!

It's been two weeks and four days...

I have been using the patch and stepped down to the last stage at the beginning of the week. I know it's earlier than recommended, but I felt ready. 

For the past few days my irritability has been upped, cravings feel more intense and now, I'm almost at work and I forgot to put on the patch. 

My deskmate is a smoker and I am so nervous about today! I normally feel prepared... Not today. 

Wish me luck! I have to make it through today somehow

When times are at a all time low, an all you can think of is the instant relief of a smoke.

Never think much about smoking any more, but I'll be dammed if today's not hard, biting my lip so hard to not cave in an just have that one cigy, that instant relief of all the shit that goes on. That instant calm an relaxing sensation that all the Problem seem just abit more minor for that time of moment! 
Gheeeze, it's like a old best friend offering support at a difficult time. 
Just times like this I wish I didn't have the thinking time.

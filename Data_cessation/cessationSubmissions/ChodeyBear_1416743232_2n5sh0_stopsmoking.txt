Accidentally breathed in a mouthful of passive smoke.

And it was gross. 

My friend and I were talking and he must have breathed his smoke in my direction as I turned to face him to talk.

It didn't make me want to smoke at all. AND it was my first day off the patches, and I totally wasn't bothered :)

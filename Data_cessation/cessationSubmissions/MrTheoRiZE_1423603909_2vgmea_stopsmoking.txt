Objectively speaking, what is the most effective (and healthiest) method of quitting cigarette addiction?

In terms of diet, exercise, thought process, day-to-day activities, work environment etc. what works the best whether in theory or proven practice? My biggest concern is the effects of my irritability issues have on the the people that surround me. I've tried to quit several times: 

One time with patches that helped me quit for a year, but it didn't help me with my second attempt. Cold-turkey+exercise+juicing/vegetarianism but irritability still remained.

Each time I sat down with friends and family and explained that this going to be hard for me and I'm going to have a short fuse and they understand, yet when I itch/crave I say things I don't mean and become irrational. This has led to start back up again several times because I hate hurting people especially family members. I'd like to avoid taking any pharmaceuticals or nicotine replacement therapies as I feel they can make addictions worse or cause more problems than it fixes. I want to quit so bad.

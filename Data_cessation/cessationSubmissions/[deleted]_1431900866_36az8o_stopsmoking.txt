Quitting and itchy skin? Is this a thing?

Hi! I just found this sub, seems like such an awesome community, so I thought i'd ask here! 

Ive always been a social smoker, only smoking when im drunk, etc but the past two month's have been super stressful in part because i have my uni exams, so i somehow graduated to smoking about a (10)pack a day.

Three days ago, I basically locked myself in the library and didnt bring my cigs with me, I've only left to eat and shower and i thought i'd use the opportunity to just up and quit! It was going really well until yesterday when my whole body started itching - like really bad, i had a panic attack, because it felt like bugs crawling all over my skin and biting me at the same time, and it really freaked me out!

I thought it was a bad combo of hay fever/pollen allergy, sleep deprivation and the modafinil i took to help me study, but I just had a cig and the itching is gone! like completely! I've ruled out the moda, because I had it on Friday morning, so it should be out of my sysstem by now. Maybe it is just the pollen?

So i dunno, im just wondering if anyone else has experienced it? And how long it lasted? Because I really want to quit, but that was just such a terrible experience! *shudder*

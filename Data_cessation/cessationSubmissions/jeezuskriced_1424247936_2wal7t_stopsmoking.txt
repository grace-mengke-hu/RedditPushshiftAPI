50 Hours in and now I feel like I have the flu?

I'm in deep right now guys. I have mucus pouring out of my nose, my throat is on fire and I feel weak. I didn't expect this. I'm still not even thinking about smoking, but is this actually normal? Is this part of quitting or am I actually just sick? I feel like I have a horrible cold and it literally hit me like a freight train about 40 hours after my last smoke and it hasn't eased up since. I got sent home from work early because I went from being basically okay to a blubbering snotty mess in a matter of minutes. There's no way I can work tomorrow if I still feel like this. I didn't expect this at all, but I'm staying strong. Anyone else get cold/flu like symptoms on days 2-3? Part of me suspects this is unrelated to quitting and I just have a bug but I find that timing unlikely.

Max Kirsten App

I'm only on day 5, but I just wanted to recommend the Max Kirsten Quit Smoking Now App to everyone who is struggling.  I'm not sure how much the hypnosis "works," but I've found the quitting process SO MUCH EASIER than I ever thought I would have.  Day 1 was rough, but livable, and it's been pretty easy since then.  The app is $7, which made me hesitate, but then I realized that it's just slightly more than a pack of cigarettes here, so I bit the bullet, and I'm glad I did.

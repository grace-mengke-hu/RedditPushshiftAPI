Going to try my part

This is probably the basic post in this group but I'm going to try and stop smoking. I've tried and tried before but now I have a reason too. My son was born and the last thing I want to happen is my health get in the way of anything for him. I'm starting tomorrow. So any advice or tips would help. 

Little background:
Pack a day
Work in a factory 5 to 6 days a week with 10 hour shifts 10 minute breaks every 2 hours and a 45 minute lunch
Smoke 3 on the way to work
1 each break
3 to 4 on lunch
The rest until I go to sleep.
Wake up and repeat everyday 
Weekends are basically the same
Gets worse if I drink. 

Not sure if that would help with advice or anything but it's what I've been doing. 

Hopefully cold Turkey doesn't kill me

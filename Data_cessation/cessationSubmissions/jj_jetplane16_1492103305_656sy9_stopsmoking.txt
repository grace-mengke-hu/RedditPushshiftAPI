Day 3- feels like I got hit by a truck

Hey there, I am now on day three and I feel absolutely terrible. Everything hurts, my sinuses are very painful, and I don't have enough energy to get out of bed. Is this normal? I have been using a patch which seems to take away a lot of the cravings, but my body is in so much pain.

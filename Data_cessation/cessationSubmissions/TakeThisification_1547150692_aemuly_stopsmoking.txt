Today is my Quit Day

I planned this since November after talking to my doctor about quitting. I've been on buproprion for a week, and I'm running out my last pack. I even told every gas station that I frequent not to sell to me.

This is all especially important for me since I need to be smoke-free to continue with sexual reassignment.

So, there it is, wish me luck!!

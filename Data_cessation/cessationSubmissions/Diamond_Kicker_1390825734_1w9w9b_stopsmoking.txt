Holy Crap, I've actually just done a month!!

I smoked for the whole last year, after a tease (for three weeks) in 2012 and my first time with cigarettes in 2006. I still remember the many scumbag-brain lies I subjected myself too and suddenly I just had to stop, in order to be a better me (a harsh and still ongoing process, possibly never-ending).

I never really posted here, but I believe that I've now learnt that a crucial part of getting over a bad habit is learning to congratulate yourself when you've achieved something that fights against it, no matter how small or unimportant it may seem to you or anybody else.

I haven't quite got much else to say, therefore I will keep wishing you all great luck in your fight against the cancer-stick cravings. Enjoy life through smell, taste and beyond and remember to love yourselves.

1 month-ers we're out here!!! :D

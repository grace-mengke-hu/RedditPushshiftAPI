2 days shy of a month smoke free :(ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜” I failed myself!

Well I thought I had it in the bag (quitting on jan 9th 2015)after the 3rd week passed without smoking. I was doing great on the Habitrol step 1 patch and using the "Smoke Free" App (awesome app by the way)but I started questioning the validity of the patch and if it really worked or if it was the placebo effect; I kept thinking maybe Its all in my head and I don't need the patch. So I stopped taking it for a few days and would put one on every other day or so and sure enough I broke down and had a few drags from my buddys smoke. Worst mistake ever!! The days following those couple drags I found myself having a couple more and now full smokes again. One of the Main reasons I quit was becuase I simply couldn't afford my own habbit and of course all of the negative health reasons. I was doing so well in the beginning and now I'm back to square on. I know I can quit, I'm determined! It's tough for me cuz I enjoy smoking so much but I hate it at the same time! Please if you read this can you say something to lift my spirits to give me the confidence back that I had a month ago! Tips, tricks, words of advice... Anything will help. Thank you

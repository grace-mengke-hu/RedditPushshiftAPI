6 months

I used this sub to help with my electronic cigarette addiction. I Never really go hooked on nicotine until I started vaping. I was smoking spliff for sometime. Anyways I dont see many posts of people whos primary addiction was from vaping. Sometimes I wish i was truly on the brink of suicide so I could justify going back to using drugs. I quit drugs because I believe that discomfort you feel inside you while sober (not withdrawing) is what drives one to do something with their life. I literally think about giving up on this existence and trying again next incarnation so I can go back to drugs tho. Im 7 months without Weed and Nicotine I miss it everyday. I suck down 4 cups of tea instead

I’ve decided I need to quit but have tried many times and failed.

I’m going to start this off with something I very much regret to tell everyone. I’m 17 and I don’t smoke cigarettes I vape. I got addicted nearly a year ago once the company you all hear about Juul was introduced to me. I couldn’t turn to my parents because they would be extremely upset with me and I don’t know if they’d let me stay in the house. I’ve tried to quit a few times and somehow ended back up in the routine of vaping. I don’t know where to start and if anyone could please help me I would be very appreciative. Thank you

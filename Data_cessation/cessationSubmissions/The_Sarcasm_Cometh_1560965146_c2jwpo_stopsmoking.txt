I can smell stale cigarette smoke now! It’s so bad!

So I’m officially just past one month of having zero tobacco/cigarettes.

I walked into a friends living room who does smoke and oh my goodness it STANK of ash! This is the first time I have ever walked into a smokers room and been able to smell it. Before I was convinced that the bad smell was just over exaggerated. 

I’m guessing this is the start of a long list of changes and improvements coming my way!

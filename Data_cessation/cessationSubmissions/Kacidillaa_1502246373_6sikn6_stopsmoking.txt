I quit smoking while I was pregnant but just started again :(

I feel terrible. I never smoke around my baby and I change my shirt, brush my teeth, and wash my hands and face after I smoke. But I know I need to stop. The stress of having a baby was really rough at first so I resorted to smoking and I never should have. I quit for so long and just threw it all away :( I'm going to try to stop after tonight. I have to for his sake and my own.

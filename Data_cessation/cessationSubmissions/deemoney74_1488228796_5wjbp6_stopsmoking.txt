Baby steps, right y'all?

On Friday it was unusually warm here (northeast Ohio) and I was enjoying sitting in my new car at lunch.  Usually I would use this time to smoke but was just relaxing with the windows down.  Then someone pulled up next to me while they were smoking.  I was pissed at the thought of my new car getting smoke in it.  When they stopped, I thought to myself, "you use to smoke in your car and now you're annoyed at someone who's not even in your car that's smoking."  I grinned at the thought of my success.  Baby steps. It's been a month for me as of today!

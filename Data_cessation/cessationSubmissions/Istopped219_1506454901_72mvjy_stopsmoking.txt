Does it get harder?

As the title says, Does it get harder?

 I’ve been without a cig for 5 days now, and the process has been fairly tame. I decided to go cold turkey, with no vape or nicotine patch, I haven’t even used Alan Carr’s book, and the hardest part of quitting was the first hour of not having a smoke.

Already I’ve noticed tremendous health benefits, my breathing has improved tenfold, my taste and smell are much better and even my ability to sing has improved!

Of course, I still get cravings during my ‘trigger points’, which are on the way to work, during work breaks, after work, after dinner and before bed, but these only last about 15 seconds before they subside.

If I’m honest, I was expecting it to be a lot worse, both mentally and physically. But so far, the worst it has been is 15 second cravings and perhaps some achey legs, and I’m a little more tired than usual.

Please don’t think from what I’ve said that I think I’m immune to relapse. I know that one cigarette, one puff will lead me back to square one and potentially full blown addiciton.

Back on the wagon

I cheated once by smoking a few cigarettes a few weeks back. I cheated again three days a few days ago by smoking a whole pack on a night out feeling depressed and now I'm back to smoking again. I feel shitty for it. I feel shitty for feeling sorry for myself but I am. I'm saying the cliches to myself again like how I'll stop again soon but I feel like I need to be honest and at least get my flair removed.

Quit everything

So two days ago I decided it is time to quit everything. Since then I haven't smoked weed, cigs, haven't drank, haven't fap'd, did cold showers and sports and ate healthy. I'm feeling so different already. Weird in a way but mostly good. First day I was pretty hyperactive due to no weed. I'll probably have problems sleeping due to weed withdraw.
There is no real point here I guess I just wanted to tell someone.

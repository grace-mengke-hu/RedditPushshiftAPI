Alright, done with that leafy crap.

Hey, guys. I started reading your subreddit yesterday while chatting with a friend who quit a while ago and decided that it had to be over. I'm done with cigarettes. For the time I switched to an e-cig with minimal nicotine (in case of bad cravings), planning on lowering nicotine content to zero as soon as possible, then quitting completely.

Thanks for opening my eyes. And thanks P., for showing me that quitting for good works.

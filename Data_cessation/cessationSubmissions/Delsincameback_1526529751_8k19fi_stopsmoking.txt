Quit a few times in the past but just got back on the wagon after two years smoke free

I’m about 5 months in and I came back to it because my life was falling apart around me and I was going through a very dark period in my life. Quitting this time feels harder than it felt in the past and I go through depressive episodes when I don’t have them for a prolonged period of time, horrible memories sort of resurface and leave me hating myself.
Anyway, I’m hoping there are others here that have experienced this and that have gotten through it to give me some encouragement and advice.
Anything you can comment will be appreciated; I’m really wanting to try quitting again tomorrow.
Thanks, guys.

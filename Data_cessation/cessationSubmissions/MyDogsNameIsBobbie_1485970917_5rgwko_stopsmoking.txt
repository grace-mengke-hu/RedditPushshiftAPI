Brain: BUT I'M DRIVING, I HAVE TO SMOKE

I've been without a smoke for 12 hours. My fiancé and I are both quitting today. We've both been smoking since we were 17. I wonder who will kill who first. 

Anyway, I took up knitting recently and when I'm home that really helps curb the cravings and help me cut down quite a bit leading up to today. However, with my job I am in my car most of the day. I drive close to 150-200 miles a day, and I smoked primarily in my car. I also live in MI so when my fiancé and I are craving one, we go out to the car and chain smoke because we don't smoke in the house and it's cold as hell here. 

It's kind of impossible to distract yourself in a safe way from wanting to smoke while in the car and driving. Chewing gum (just regular gum, not into NRT) helps slightly, and so does having a quick snack, but I don't want to take in extra calories if possible. 

So, what have you guys found helps in the car? This has been my hardest challenge yet. Thanks and good luck to everyone :)

After 20 years, one pack a day, today is a new day

I'm 35, have been smoking for about 20 years, and for a few years now that went to one pack a day on average. Not anymore. 

I always told myself I'd quit whenever I would have kids. The wish to have kids never came (and luckily neither did the kids). But the wish to stop smoking has been growing for a while now. Two big reasons: one is that I feel my throat has had stuck phlegm since a very long time. I wish to get rid of this. Second reason is money. I've put it into Excel: €5.50 a day translates into €38 a week / €165 a month / €2000 a year. That's a months salary every year. That's a lot of money I wish I would have had in the previous years. 

So yesterday I've bought my last pack. Half of it is gone by now. This morning I've smoked my last cigarette (I hope). I'm 4 hours in now and the cravings are bad. The second guessing has started: maybe I should reduce my smoking before quitting cold turkey ; smoke my last half a pack before quitting definitely ; consider that half a pack as ten allowed cheats ; listen to that Allen Carr audiobook before quitting ; not have smoked that first/last cigarette this morning so I would have had a head-start ; better prepare myself with reading up / making plans / setting myself up with some rewards /  etcetera. 

The habits seem hard to break now: that first cigarette with some coffee in the morning ; the cigarette breaks at work ; the one I usually have after lunch ; before going to bed. 

Anyway, wish me luck I guess. I've installed the Smokefree app on my phone; requested a badge for this subreddit ; set myself up with some tea so I can cut down on coffee and bought grapes and m&m's to keep my fidgety hands busy. If you have tips that worked for you, I'll be happy to hear them.

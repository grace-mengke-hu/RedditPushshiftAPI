Terrifying health concerns + totaled car = a possible moment of weakness.

So I saw the eye doctor because of recent bouts of blurred-vision & dizziness, and he scheduled an immediate MRI and/or brain scan next week to rule-out a possible mass/tumor.  Scary.  The very next day wrecked my car on the freeway, and watched as the guy I hit lit-up a cigarette to "relax" after the accident.  And honestly, for a moment I briefly thought about saying fuck-it, and bumming one.  But no.  This will not make me feel better - must deal with stressful situations in the raw.  To hell with smoking, and the same-old illusion.  Nice try, troll brain!

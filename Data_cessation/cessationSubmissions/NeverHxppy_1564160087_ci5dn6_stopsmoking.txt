Everything stinks!

Weird ass side effect. 

Day five for me (to be clear it's vaping for me and not smoking, but still nicotine withdrawal of a pretty hefty dose). I didn't expect to get a lot of the same benefits of stopping, namely improved sense of taste and smell, since I thought that would be smoking specifically, and that vaping was "cleaner"..  But over the last 24 to 48 hours or so, everything suddenly seems to smell much stronger. To the extent that it is making me feel a bit queezy! Now I'm a bit of a clean freak, I clean my whole house daily, but I can smell everything in my home, I'm a bit off food, everything is just a bit weird! 

Can anyone relate?

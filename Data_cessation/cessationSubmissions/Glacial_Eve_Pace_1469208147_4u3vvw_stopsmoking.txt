I quit, but my boyfriend refuses to

I'm at day 15 and know I made the right decision to quit. I smoked an average of 12 cigs a day for 4 years. The first week was hell quitting cold turkey, but here I am. 

I've experienced all the benefits of quitting that are all over this sub including having my acne clear up. I'm never looking back, but the man in my life is still stuck smoking.

I've asked him to quit with me so we can experience all of the benefits together, but he said no. If I guilt him into quitting, he smokes more. Talking about all the benefits I experience pisses him off. I refuse to be a smoker couple and I refuse to ever go back to smoking. I love this man so an ultimatum or breaking up is not an option. 

Any ideas on how to better encourage him or put him on the right path? I know it's ultimately up to him to stop, but I want to be as supportive as I can. 

Thanks!

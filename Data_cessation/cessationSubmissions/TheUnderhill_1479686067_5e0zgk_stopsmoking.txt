15 days. 11 hours.

I'm watching football this Sunday. I'm on my second Sunday since quoting and haven't slowed down on my drinking at all. For some reason I have a huge urge to smoke a cigarette right now. After 2 weeks is it all mental or is there something physical happening to? I'm only looking for a reason to justify my feelings and let me look at this correctly before I would give in.

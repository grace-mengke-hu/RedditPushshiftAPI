DAY ONE

It is 3:54AM on October 4th. I had my last cigarette at 5:43am on October 3rd. I'm in a terrible mood. I am angry at everything around me. My usual interests have been pissing me off. My husband is upset because he thinks I'm mad at him. I feel like crap. Gonna watch a show and go to bed. I made it a day, almost. I'm almost there.

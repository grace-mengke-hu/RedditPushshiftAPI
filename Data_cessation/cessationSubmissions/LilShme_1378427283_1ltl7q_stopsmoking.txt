Day 1 and I can really only tell you guys...

I quit today after almost 3 years of smoking about a pack every other day. I know there are a lot of similar first day posts and I wasn't going to contribute at first, but I realized it's really the only place I can. I've tried to quit before and the disappointment from friends and family when I fell off the wagon was horrible. So keeping this to myself until I am more stable. Thanks for giving me a place to let it out a bit :) 

I've hit bottom and quitting smoking is a way for me to gain a bit more control. I'm better than my addiction... Just gotta prove it to myself. And hell, if I can do this, I can seriously do anything!

Congrats on everyone else's progress. I hope I can stick with this!

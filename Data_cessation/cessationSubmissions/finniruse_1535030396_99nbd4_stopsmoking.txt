Quitting smoking feels like my brain is turning on... and that's bad.

I'm trying to quit smoking again, folks. It's been four days and I feel like most of the nicotine is out of my system. I've been sleeping a ton and it feels like my brain is switching back on. 

That's a problem. I'm starting to realise (once again) that the reason I smoke, or drink, is to quieten that inner voice. I find it spirals out of control very quickly and my anxiety levels go through the roof. 

Anxious thoughts are a lot like an addiction in their own right: they get your blood pumping. I just want to turn off my brain and that's why I've always turned to smoking, caffeine, alcohol to the point where I don't think I've been fully sober of these things at any point for a decade. 

I'm not really sure why I'm posting this. I guess just to see whether it's the same for anyone else? 

Does anyone have any ideas on being OK with cigarette sobriety?

PS. It's really weird. I felt compelled to re-read Stephen King's Doctor Sleep this week. It's a horror novel, fundamentally, but it's also book about sobriety and dealing with inner demons. I just thought I wanted some cheap scares, but maybe I have a gift myself? I have 'The Shining' right, guys? Right? :P

Thanks, and good luck fellow quitters.

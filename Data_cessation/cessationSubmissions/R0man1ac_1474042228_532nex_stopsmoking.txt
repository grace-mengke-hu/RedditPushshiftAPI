Serial quitter.

I'm quitting again. I don't know why I keep picking this stuff up when I hate it so much. 

Smoked my last one last night. Around twelve hours ago. 

About three years ago I quit for almost a year. Took a drag off a friends smoke while taking her home. That was all it took, picked up a pack on my way home after dropping her off. 

I smoked again for maybe another five months. Quit again for almost a year. Dumb me picked it back up again. 

Since then I've quit more times than I can count. Sometimes for a few weeks. Sometimes for a month. Sometimes for a couple of months. 

I hate the way it makes me feel. Within weeks my breathing is worse. I'm lazy. I have headaches. I get anxious when I don't have a pack near me. 

When I'm not smoking I'm active. I feel great. I keep up with my yoga. I'm happier. 

I recently also quit smoking pot. (again). Not that I see anything wrong with it physically, or think anyone else smoking should quit. I've just found that for me the two go hand in hand. It's like I can't have one without the other, and I want to be done with being dependent on the way something like smoking makes me feel. 

I know I'm ranting, and I don't really think anyone will read this or care. But I've found that in the past my quit attempts have been easier and longer if I talk about it in this subreddit. I'm hoping this just keeps me accountable and I won't cave. 

Thanks if you've listened and read this far, I will not smoke today.

My last cigarette was 10 minutes ago. I'm done! Any app suggestions?

Got a health scare this week (still currently in it) and I'm done. I quit smoking weed a week ago (just did it before going to bed to calm my mind) that was not hard. But my lovely cigarettes, they do really feel like my friends. Are gone now too.

I want to never touch a cigarette ever again. I broke all the ones I had left and threw them out. It's done. But I need help. I've tried so many times and always failed (obviously). But I feel pathetic now. I don't want to walk around with an oxygen tank later. I'm 30 now. It's not cool anymore. I want to have children soon and it just has to be over.
But I need help! What are some good apps you guys recommend? Also any tips on the first few days? Those are the hardest for me.

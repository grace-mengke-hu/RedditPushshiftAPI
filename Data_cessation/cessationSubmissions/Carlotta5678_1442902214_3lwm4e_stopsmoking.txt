Boyfriend can't stop smoking - don't know how to help?

Made new account just to post this - been in an amazing relationship for 6 years, living together for 4. He smoked when we met but said he wanted to quit from day one. Has struggled with quitting off and on due to stress from a shitty job (which he just left) and the fact that most of his friends still smoke. He says he's determined to quit but keeps going back and I don't know what else to do to help him stop without going too far and ruining our relationship. Thought I'd see if anyone here had advice as I see some great success stories.

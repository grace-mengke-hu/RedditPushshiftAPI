On vacation with the family.

Jesus there been fighting every night.  I wanna smoke so bad to make it go away.  Parents are acting like kids.  I can't drink any more bc after last night assholes cant handle them selfs and now im baby sitting.  I would leave but then ill get guilted about it later.  Im not talking to much to them.  Keeping it on a real low lvl.  Its really fucking lame.  Probably gonna be the last vacations i go on with my family.  I really want to smoke but ill end up hating my self more.

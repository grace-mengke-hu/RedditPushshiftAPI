I'm 18 years old, started smoking a half a year ago. I'm going to quit

I am going to quit smoking NOW.

I am going to use empty cigarette tubes and a rolling machine to roll a bunch of skullcap cigarettes and keep them in my old packs.

So when I want a smoke. I can have one without smoking tobacco. I'm determined to quit.

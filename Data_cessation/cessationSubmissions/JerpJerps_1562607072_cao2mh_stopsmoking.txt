I need to quit

I was a year and a few months quit. About a month ago it all went down the drain. I finished my last one off my pack a few hours ago and told myself “this is the last one” out loud. I hope it’s not as hard as last time, I hope this last month didn’t undo all the walls I took so long to build. Smoking is a nasty nasty habit. I already want to just go home and take a nap to forget about the cravings. A few things I have going for me is my family doesn’t know about my falling out. And I’d love more then anything just to forget about this last month and only mention it to them in a few months down the road when I haven’t touched them again for awhile. 

I want to not smoke again with the friends that had quit after me and looked to me for inspiration.
I want to feel what it’s like to wake up again not groggy and not have such an unlevelled feeling in my brain. 
I want the burden of “eventually letting everyone know I’m a smoker again” to be lifted and not have to even let my loved ones see me puffing on that shit again.
I want to be able to walk up the steep hill on my way to work without feeling breathless again.
I want to get into the subway or sit in a hairdressers chair and know I don’t smell like shit again.
I’m sick of every aspect of it and now more then ever in the past few years due to new circumstances I really can’t afford this habit. 

I need to quit for every reason in the world.
Omg I hope I can stick it though again..

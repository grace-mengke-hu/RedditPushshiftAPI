I'm using champix to quit yay

I've used it before I don't even understand how I relapsed either if I am honest. There was just a pouch of baccy on the kitchen side and I decided to have a smoke.  I was smoking weed as well so that probably didn't help.

This will be my second time using champix, I'm giving up smoking and weed as well this time around) 

 It's fantastic I don't mind the vivid dreams (I'm used to having night terrors so it's quite a nice change to have sexy dreams especially when they are so vivid).  I'm on day 5 now- have cut down from 10 a day to about 2 a day (spread out to 4 cigarettes- I have about 4 drags and then feel sick).

Good luck to all those quitting! If you have any questions about my experience with champix (current and past) don't hesitate to ama!

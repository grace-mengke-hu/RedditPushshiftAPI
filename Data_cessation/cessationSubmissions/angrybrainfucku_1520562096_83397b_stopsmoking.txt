7 successful days in terms of work, relationship and overall mood.

Today was a very difficult day. I'm going through depression because of withdrawal from nicotine and some other life issues. I'm going cold turkey so withdrawal is a bit intense. But I swear to God (if there is any) Meditation (mindfulness) helps a lot to reduce anxiety, anger, depression, cravings and over thinking. I'm glad that I'm starting to love it. I'm getting rid of distraction addiction as well with the help of Meditation. Whoever invented Meditation God bless him(if there is any). To correct impulsive behavior meditation is great. Believe me. I'm practicing Meditation for last 9 days and it helped me quit the day  before my birthday. 25th (03/03).

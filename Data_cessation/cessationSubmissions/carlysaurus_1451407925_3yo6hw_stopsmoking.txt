Almost a month! A few thoughts...

I wanted to post today because I'm sure we'll be getting a lot of new subscribers on January 1st, and that will be my one month anniversary with no tobacco!

Three weeks ago I thought I would never stop thinking about smoking. The thoughts certainly aren't gone, but I just don't worry about it anymore. I can easily go a day without even remembering that I quit. 



**My favorite benefits so far:**

* My SO says I smell better
* I've saved $104.76
* I don't have to panic about whether I have enough smokes to get thru the day without stopping at the gas station.
* When I smell other smokers now, I realize that's what I smelled like. I had no idea!

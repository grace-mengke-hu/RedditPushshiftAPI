feeling great!

I just feel like saying something...I smoked for about 10+ years. I've tried to quit many times. Always failing each time I tried. I wanted to try something new this time around and it has worked the best so far. Don't count. Don't count how many days its been. I know kind of how many days its been since I've had one last. probably around 2 weeks but I just kind of act to myself like I don't know hahaha and so far this is the best I've felt since quitting. wish me luck!

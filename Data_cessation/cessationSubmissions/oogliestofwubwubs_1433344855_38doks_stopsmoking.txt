Day 16.

The last two weeks flew by, but for some reason this one is CREEPING.
There is a part of me that feels like I've never smoked, then there is the small voice  that constantly says "smokesmokecigarettesmokeahhhh".

Anyway. I have not smoked and don't plan on doing so today.

PLUS I started the c25k last night.  I barely made it and I'm really proud of myself.

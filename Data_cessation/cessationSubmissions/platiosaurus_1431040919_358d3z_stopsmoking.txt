Finals has a habit of turning non-smokers into smokers

So it's finals season at my university and it's rough right now. My housemate who doesn't smoke has picked it up during the crunch time. packs lay around the living room and friends come over to share smokes and de-stress. It's killing me. Being so early on in the quit process makes me wish i'd waited till after finals.

I know that's just another bullshit excuse my head's making up and i don't really believe it, but i'm peppered with constant cravings and i'd be tremendously grateful for some help. Thank you all

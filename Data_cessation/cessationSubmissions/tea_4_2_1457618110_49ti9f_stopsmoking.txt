I don't want to see your ugly old butt

Spring is breaking early in my little corner of the world this year. As I have been getting out and watching for the signs of spring, I am shocked at how much smoking litter is out there everywhere. Being early in quit, I admit to being hyper sensitive to all things smoking related. I won't be the ex-smoking ball buster, I hated them when I smoked, but please smoker people - show some restraint and toss your trash properly. For what it's worth, when I did smoke, I didn't litter with my habit.

Rant over.

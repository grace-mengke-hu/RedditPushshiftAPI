Today is my 2-year quit anniversary

It wasn't easy, but was the best New Year's resolution I ever made. I am happy. I think I'll celebrate by...fully appreciating a glass of wine...singing in a high register...*playing with my baby who I probably wouldn't have carried to term and might not have even conceived if I hadn't quit.* The last 2 I'll do in the morning because he's asleep now, and I'd like him to stay that way for at least 6 more hours.

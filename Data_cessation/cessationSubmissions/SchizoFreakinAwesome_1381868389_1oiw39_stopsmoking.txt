Third time trying to quit and new to this sub.

I have tried to quit twice before. The second time I tried cold turkey with the help of Allan Carr's book. I didn't succeed. I made it about two weeks then was back to a pack a day. I am trying again starting today using an e-cig and I wanted thoughts on quitting with this method. I ave heard mixed reviews. Any support would be great as well, thanks!

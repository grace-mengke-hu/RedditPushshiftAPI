One cig leads to a pack

I am on day 8 and feeling surprisingly good. A lot of energy, fewer cravings, manageable cravings. But every night before bed I always want one cigarette. I haven't given in only because I have read on this subreddit over and over again that one cigarette will lead to a pack and I know deep down that this is true. I just want to thank you all for your support and encouragement!

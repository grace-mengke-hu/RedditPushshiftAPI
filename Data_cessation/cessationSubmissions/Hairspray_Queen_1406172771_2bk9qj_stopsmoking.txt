I need to hear some sounds that recognize the pain in me

Hi everyone.  I just need to vent I guess?  Or have some company in misery?  This is so hard.  I am a week and a half in and at the current moment I feel like I could just cry forever, morning the loss of my cigarettes.  I KNOW I have to retrain my thought process and I can't keep thinking like this but right now I feel like there is a cigarette shaped hole in my heart.  I feel like I have lost my best friend and soul mate and the only thing that was always there to comfort me and always understood.  It's ridiculous because obviously a stupid fucking cigarette is not capable of being any of that,  but apparently on some deep level,  I have assigned them that magnitude of meaning.  I feel so empty and heartbroken and depressed.  Sometimes the thought creeps into my mind that my life will be forever  empty and joyless without smoking; it will never be quite right or whole again.  Like I said,  I know I HAVE to battle these thoughts.  I have struggled with depression most of my life,  so it is a difficult exercise for me to cultivate a positive outlook in general much of the time... Anyway,  thank you for letting me get this off my chest.

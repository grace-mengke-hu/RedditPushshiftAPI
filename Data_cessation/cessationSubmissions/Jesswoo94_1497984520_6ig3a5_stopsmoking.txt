Back to day one after about a week in the clear

A week and some days ago I opted for NRT, after smoking a pack a day and sometimes then some.

I've been smoking since I was 16. 
Now at 23 I want to change things for good. 
Long story short, while working the bar at a wedding, I smoked an amazing cigar and then a pack over the next two days. 
First day it was only two or three and the next day back to the old habit. 
I kept realising over and over again that the smokes didn't do much for me other than to fill my time and satisfy the habit. 
I realised that, when i started about a week ago, this is the first time that I actually want to quit smoking.
Still have a long road ahead of me though. 

So back to day one. 

Stay strong fellow quitters

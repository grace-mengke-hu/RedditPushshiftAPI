3 weeks success

not that i haven't had cravings, my job is ridiculous and needlessly stressful. really need a new job. really. but i haven't smoked. a coworker asked me for a cigarette today. i replied, "i quit, 3 weeks ago today." he was all, good for you  blah blah and ran off to find someone else to ask. it felt really good to not be craving like that. my cravings are small and insignificant compared to what they were when i was a full on smoker and was out of smokes. i love not being a slave to the pack. it is my favorite part of quitting. and there are a lot of great things about quitting.

Stopped smoking out of the blue for apparently no reason at all.

So it's been five days now. The first two were hard but somehow I managed to get through work (hospitality) and university (law student) and all the stress that comes with those without having a cigarette.
I guess it helps that they're so expensive in Australia...
But it was literally just out of the blue. I finished one pack (rather, the chef finished mine off) and I just decided not to buy another one.
While I was at work today, I didn't even think about it. Usually I'll have a 5 minute smoke break every hour or so, which blows my mind. 

So now I find that when I quit specifically for one reason and one alone, it puts too much pressure on myself and I set myself up to fail. Now that I'm quitting, purely just because I want to and not because (and these are some of my motivations for quitting in the past), losing weight or gaining muscle, getting my sense of smell or taste back, saving money or because it grosses people out. 

So, don't put too much pressure on yourself. This is like, my 5th attempt at quitting after smoking for 3 years. 

Don't give up on giving up :p

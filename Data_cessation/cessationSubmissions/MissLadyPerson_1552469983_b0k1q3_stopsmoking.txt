Well this fucking blows.

Hubby is mad at me. I am trying to quit and he isn't yet, and I told him I was sad today. He began to lecture me about how "it will get easier every day" (common lie, it literally doesn't and it never has any time I have quit), I just have to keep pushing through, and don't smoke any cigarettes tomorrow (I hit one of his twice) because it'll ruin everything forever (he knows I do not respond well to that type of thinking), and then started going on about how when he quits he needs me to do what he is doing for me. So I playfully asked if he wanted me to lecture him. He starts crying about how everyone is sooooo mean to him. 



Then he gives me the silent treatment, plays a video game next to me (while I passive aggressively watch Criminal Minds), and smokes a fucking cigarette. 



I don't know whether to cry or destroy things. Both? I dunno. Times like this I wonder why even quit? I don't care about myself right now. Why not slowly kill myself? What is the fucking disadvantage?

Best tips for stop smoking

Hey everyone! I’ve been a non-smoker for a little more than 3 weeks by now and figure that we should all have a common thread where we can share our best tips for stop smoking to help others succeed. 

Here are some of mine: 
1. Plan a date in advance and prepare mentally 
2. Go cold turkey and be off work/studies for 1 week to give yourself time to get over the worst symptoms 
3. Tell everyone around you about this to get support and understanding 
4. Read as much as possible on the topic to understand what is going on in your body and how to tackle cravings. 
5. Let yourself do whatever you need to stay smoke free
6. Workout every day (I go on 30 min runs in the mornings). 
7. Download the “smoke free” app. 
8. Get support here on reddit 
9. Chew normal gums. Buy shitloads of different kinds and make it into a buffeé
10. Celebrate every time you manage to achieve something during this period. For example every craving you resist gives you the right to treat yourself with something.

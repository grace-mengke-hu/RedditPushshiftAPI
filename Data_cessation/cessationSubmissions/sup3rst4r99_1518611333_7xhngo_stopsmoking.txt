Does smoking make anxiety worse?

As the topic says;
Does smoking make anxiety worse? I'm 10 days in and it seems like my anxiety disorder has changed in some ways.
I'm not feeling the surge of adrenaline, the constant feeling of dread has eased. In short; it seems to be better already in just 10 days.

Maybe it will be even better in some time? (weeks-&gt;months)

How has your experience been?

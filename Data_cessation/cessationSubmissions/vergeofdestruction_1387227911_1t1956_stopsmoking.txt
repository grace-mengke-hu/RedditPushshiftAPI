100 days cravings

First of all I would like to thank both the subreddit and all of you kind people for you support. It's doing wonders for us newly quitters. 

I've been off the cancer sticks for 102 days now, but recently I've been having issues with it. One month into quitting the cravings disappeared completely and I was a happy man that I've finally managed to beat these things. However, over the past two weeks I keep getting bad cravings that don't seem to go away. I thought the cravings would disappear with time. Has anyone else experienced this kind of thing? Does it ever truly disappear?

Thank you!

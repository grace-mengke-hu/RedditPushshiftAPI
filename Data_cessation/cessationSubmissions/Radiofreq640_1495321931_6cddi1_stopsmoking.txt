6+ days smoke free. After being a smoker for 27 years.

I was a bad chain smoker. I usually smoked at least 2 packs a day. Well day 6 has been very difficult. I'm super crabby and irritable. Got into a argument and was about to leave to go get smokes and decided not to. Ugh I wish I didn't ever start to begin with. Trying my hardest to stick with it.

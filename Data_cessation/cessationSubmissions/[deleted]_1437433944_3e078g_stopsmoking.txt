To my friends and coworkers who still smoke

I quit for myself. I'm not trying to be better than you. I don't think I am any better than any one of you. I made a desicion by myself and for myself. Stop telling me I'm turning into a "health freak" and "what happened to the chill Jack". I don't shove anything in your face. Fuck i don't even talk about quitting except to say "no thanks" when you offer me a cig. Im getting in better shape just to try to *cope with the awful effects* of not smoking anymore. I'm still the same person. I still eat crap food sometimes and don't sleep enough most of the time. I shouldn't have to smoke and drink to be accepted. 

You don't have to support me in this. Please stop teasing me though. Stop telling me it's "cute" but I'm going to fail, it's me being influenced by other people, it's stupid and lame and pointless. Stop asking me when I'll start again. I WON'T. I didn't offer my opinion regarding any of your habits and I'm not asking for yours about mine. Can you just fucking leave me alone?

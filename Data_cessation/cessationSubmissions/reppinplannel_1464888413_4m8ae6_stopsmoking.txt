Do you guys ever just...get tired?

Hey all. 

I haven't really posted here since the beginning, but I'm still going strong. Had a slip-up weekend a few weeks back, but I've decided not to count it, since I was halfway across the country and remembered how much I hate the stink of it. Haven't touched a butt since I got home.

Posting because I kind of want some encouragement, and I'm wondering if anyone can relate to how I'm feeling. Sometimes I feel like my cravings evolve into this different kind of mind trick. Instead of constantly fighting my inner voice saying I want or need a cigarette, I just get this feeling instead like it doesn't matter. It just doesn't matter at all anymore. So what if I have a cigarette? So what if I smoke at all? Who really cares? I'm tired. I'm stressed and I'm tired and life is hard and scary and who would honestly blame me? 

I've been having feelings like this for months now, and I guess I just need someone to tell me to keep going.

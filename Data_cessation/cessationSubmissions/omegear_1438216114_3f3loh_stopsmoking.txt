Trying to stop, need some advices

Hello everyone,
First of all excuse my English it's not my native language.

I started smoking 3 years ago with weed then just completly switched to cigarettes this last year. I'm smoking around 10 cig / day

I'm a concept artist and the nicotine helps me get some kind of creativity-boost. When I'm looking for ideas, I feel like a cigarets help me create something more intense, more in-depth.

The problem with quitting is that cigarettes are completely linked to my profession now... I'm also Freelancer so I'm all day at home, alone. It's very hard to not smoke.

Any advices would be really welcome.

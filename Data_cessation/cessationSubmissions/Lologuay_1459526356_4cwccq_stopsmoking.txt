So I am feeling depressed and cigs are on my mind again

So Ive been around 4 months clean. I have been somewhat depressed for the last week or so for no apparent reason. As I hate to feel the way I do, my mind is looking for solutions to the problem, and one of those solutions is: "Just smoke one and It will deliver the ummmppf that I need to feel better".


I Know that is complete BS, but my mind is casting all other thoughts aside, and I feel like Homer Simson in front of a hamburger.

I am 43, and there is no way I would go back, but it seems that my mind thinks other wise. I hope I can find another way to defer the felling.

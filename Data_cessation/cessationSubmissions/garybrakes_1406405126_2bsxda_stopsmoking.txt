Hi , im a 22 year old male and i've been smoking since the age of 13. I have tried to stop smoking for about 5 times or so. Im literally a different person when i havent had a smoke in few hours.. snapping to my girlfriend and just a f*cking wreckage... i have tried those nicotinegums but im not sure if thats the way to stop the addiction.. Any kind of help is appreciated

I keep failing

I keep failing. I had a cigarette today after not even 24 hours of not smoking. I haven't read this book everyone is talking about, where can I read it? I feel so disappointed in myself and I know I'm going to keep smoking later on today. Someone please help me? How do you start and stick with it? Thanks

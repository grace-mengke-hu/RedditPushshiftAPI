Struggling with new "support."

I was a smoker (about a pack a day) from 12yo through high school. I quit cold turkey the first day of college. It wasn't easy, but I did it. Fast forward a decade, and my dumb ass grabs a pack during harvest. That was a little more than a year ago, and I've been struggling ever since. 

One of the biggest issues is hiding it from my husband. My career is all consuming, so my husband is the extent of my personal life. I know he's known all along, but he called me out on it a few weeks ago. I'm too ashamed to adequately articulate what I need as far as support goes, so it turns into him asking, "how's your smoking thing going?"  I only respond with something like, "bad" or "crappy."

I guess what I'm getting at is that I feel more pressure/stress/less support as I'm trying to quit than I did before (when I tried to quit 10ish times).  I'm also having dissonance - and therefore more excuses - with why I'm trying to quit. 

How can I make this easier?

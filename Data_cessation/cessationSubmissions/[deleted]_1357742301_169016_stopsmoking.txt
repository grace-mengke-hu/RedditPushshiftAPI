i smoked one last night. but it was after amazing sex. 

i quit for new years and have been doing really well (8 days without a single cig). but last night i met up with a lady friend of mine. we had a couple drinks at the bar then went back to my place and we knocked boots. immediately after, she lit up cig and i could not help myself. i asked her for just a drag but she shook her head and said "after sex like that you want a full one". i could not and did not argue with her about that. i enjoyed the cheap menthol smoke because of the circumstances (i used to smoke marb 27s and never liked menthol), but today i feel like i let myself down in a way. what do you guys think?? does smoking one cigarette after great sex constitute a reset of my days clean count?? or is this type of situation considered extenuating circumstances??

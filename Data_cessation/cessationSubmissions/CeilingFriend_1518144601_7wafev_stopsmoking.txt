Not today, crazy...

My children were in a wild mood tonight and briefly I felt the need to smoke to cope, but I’m almost finished with Allen Carr’s book and I knew if I smoked it would make me crazy. The “help or relaxation” smoking brings is a lie. I certainly don’t need to add stress to my life, and with that thought it was easy to say no. I’m feeling grateful for the levelheadedness I had tonight.

Quit as of Friday night.  Day #4 tomorrow...

To make a long story short, I've been a half-pack per day smoker for the past 3 years.  I tried weed for the first time this weekend and had a horrible experience.  I was sick all weekend, and had such a bad panic attack after smoking I thought I was going to die.  While I lay there on the floor in the bathroom telling myself to stay awake and keep focus, I made myself a promise that I would not only never smoke marijuana again, but that I would stop poisoning my body with tobacco and alcohol.  Saturday and Sunday were easy to get through because I was so sick from Friday night that I slept through both days.  Today was the first true test though.  I really wanted one after breakfast before driving to work, but it wasn't too hard to resist.  At work, I usually go out for a 10am, noon & 2pm smoke with different co-workers throughout the week, and skipping that was the hardest thing I've had to do in a very long time.  Not only stay at my desk, but to watch the clock and know that it was my "break time" that I would typically look forward to each day, it was gut wrenching.  But somehow I did it, and I'm hoping each day gets easier.  What really sucks though is living with 2 friends who both smoke (outside, at least).  I'm hoping my newly forged willpower will eventually rub off on them.  Until then, I'm on my own.  I haven't had any cravings for alcohol yet, hopefully that habit is easier to kick than smoking.

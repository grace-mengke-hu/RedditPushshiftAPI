Day 5!

And I feel pretty good.  My smell is so much better - hitting the showers more often.  Have been going to the gym last 2 weeks working on cardio and I no longer have the wheeziness I used to get as I have been a daily smoker for about 10 years.

Craving a smoke really bad after mealtimes.  I'm using a nicotine mist spray which is helping, I try to resist it though and use it for emergencies.  I'm just thinking of all the bad shit smoking does everytime I need a smoke.

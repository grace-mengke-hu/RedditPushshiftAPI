Week and 2 days

Hello, this is my first time posting here. I've quit smoking, again (4th time really trying?), for a little over a week now. When I'm not at work, I don't smoke. My work involves me spending months from home, in a shitty environment and I usually quit this stuff the day after I come home for vacation. But I feel the withdrawal this time is affecting my mentality. I've gotten very irritable, depressed, lethargic, and an overwhelming feeling of fuck it all. After two years, my girlfriend finally understands how hard it is to stop this stuff after giving me shit for smoking and I thought her support would be helpful, but it's not. Any former smokers have any advice to get through this?

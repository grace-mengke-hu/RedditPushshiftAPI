22 days no smoking

I smoked for 5 years. The last 3.5 years was 1 pack a day at $5.54+. It had a tight grip on me. I tired to quit at least 3-4 times. I heard a lady talking about quitting after 20 years of heavy smoking. She used Chantix. I made my mind up to quit for good. It cost me $280 to visit a clinic and get the 28 day supply of Chantix. You can smoke for the first 7 days of taking the pills, and then you have to stop. For me, it worked. It's not been easy by any means. You have to commit and change habits. There were many cravings the first couple weeks, but they are almost a thing of the past now. I have four days of Chantix remaining. It was recommended to take for 4 months, but I do not see the need. I'M DONE!!!

32 days, smoking dreams.

It's been 32 days since I've quit. My day to day is pretty craving free but I have been having dreams lately where I'm smoking in them and they make my feel nervous like I accidentally messed up all my progress. Conscious me doesn't want another cigarette but unconscious me is still having trouble letting go.

I haven't been back here in a while but wanted to come back for my one year anniversary.  I DID IT!!!

I still miss smoking sometimes but I have zero cravings and don't ever, ever, ever miss being a smoker.

To anybody in the early stages: keep it up! you can do it! you absolutely can.

To anybody looking to quit:  I can't recommend chantix enough.  Ask you doctor.

Oh my god, you guys! Still craving like crazy.

It's been almost three months and the last few weeks, I have been craving so, so, so much. I saw a guy with his arm out his car window with a cigarette in his hand. I was so sad that I would never have one of those again.  I keep wanting them.  I won't have one - I won't let myself.  I have too many reasons to never have another one. But Oh. My. God. Can this stop now, please?

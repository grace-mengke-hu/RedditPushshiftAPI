Started smoking 8 months ago in treatment....now I'm hooked.

I told myself "I won't get addicted, it's just something to do when I'm bored." Now I'm struggling to quit. It's such an expensive and pointless addiction. I'm a typical addict, so I'm really good at rationalizing with myself. I want to stop so bad...

Any tips on quitting?

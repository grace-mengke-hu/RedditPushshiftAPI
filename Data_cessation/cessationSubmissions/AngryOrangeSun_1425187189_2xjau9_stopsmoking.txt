Quitting for the second time...

I started smoking in high school, then quit when I turned 21. I was good for almost 4 years till I started having the "occasional" cigarette at work (I work construction)  , since then I have have become a  secret smoker which I know is bullshit because everyone knows when someone smokes. This has been going on for about 2 1/2 years now. The  thing that kills me is that I had been lying to my girlfriend/ now fianc√©e about it. Of course she knows and has known for some time. 

This has added to my guilt but I still find it so much harder to quit this time than the first. I don't know why I'm typing this, we just had a wonderful date night out and got into a conversation about it before bed. Now I just feel horrible and that I have no will power. How can something so small have such a huge impact on my everyday life? I guess I don't know where else to turn. Just looking for support from some people who have been here before.

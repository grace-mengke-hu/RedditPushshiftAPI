Week 1

Completed 7 days being a non-smoker. I feel great! I can breathe better, I no longer run out of breath by just walking around, I can smell things, I have more energy, I feel more confident and have started being more assertive... The cravings have almost stopped. Right now most are like flashes when I think a cigarette would be "good"... But before I can do anything about it... or even complete the thought, it's gone. Literally less than a second. Though they have been getting more frequent lately... roughly 3-4 times a day. Just have wait for my body to catch up to the new norm I guess.

Thanks guys for the support!

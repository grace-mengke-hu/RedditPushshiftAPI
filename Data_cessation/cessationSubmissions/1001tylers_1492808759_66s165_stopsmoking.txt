Smoke Free Budget Advice?

Well I'm at 10 days without smoking cigarettes. It's finally starting to get a bit easier. I really wonder what the odds are that this will be the last time I have to quit?

Basically, I'm doing my budget and I'm trying to figure out whether or not I should budget for a habit that would cost me $360.00 per month.

Realistically I could never afford to smoke to begin with.

I guess my concern here is what the odds are that I will slip up? Would you risk renting a place you can't afford if you slip up and start smoking again?

Should I just budget and do everything as if the cigarettes are permanently gone or should I factor them in just in case?

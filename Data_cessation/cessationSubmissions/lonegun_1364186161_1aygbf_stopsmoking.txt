Was smoke free for 30 hours, and then...

I work inner city EMS as a Paramedic.  Quit smoking after 10 years.  30 hours smoke free.  Until our patients toe rotted off his foot as we took his shoes off at the hospital.  The smell...the smell alone.  So ill reset my quit date after im done with this pack.  Sorry to let you guys down.

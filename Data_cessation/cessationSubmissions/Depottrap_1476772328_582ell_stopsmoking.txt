Anyone else constantly exhausted?

So I've been a pack a day smoker for about 7 years, I recently just ordered an e-cigarette to help me with my quitting process.
Thanks to my e-cig the cravings have not been bad at all, I have had my e-cig for a week now and have only smoked 2 cigs during this time.
My biggest symptom so far (asides from a few headaches) is that I'm now constantly tired throughout my days now, I sleep 8-10 hours a night and I wake up feeling as if I've had no sleep and rather just feeling exhausted.
I even find myself sometimes taking 3-4 hour naps in the day and when I wake I feel as if I could go right back to sleep. I know that everyone is different due to different factors and reasons, but generally how long should I expect to be feeling like this for?

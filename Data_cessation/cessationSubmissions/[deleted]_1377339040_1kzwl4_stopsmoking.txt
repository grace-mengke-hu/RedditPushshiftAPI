Still strong, I don't give a f@ck about everyone going nuts around me

Second day, my girlfriend suddenly starts whining as hell about everything and blames me for crap that I had nothing to do with, suddenly none of my clients have time and a shitload of problems fall on me from everywhere. Murphy's Law? I don't give a single damn f@ck, I'll stay strong.

14 days, not feeling better or worse..

Hey there. First of all thanks for all the motivation. Really keeps me going when i read all of you non smokers experiences.

So.. I've been a non smoker for for 14 days out of the last 6-8 years. The fact that i have not been smoking for 14 days makes me happy, but i don't really feel any good or bad side effects at all? I haven't noticed my taste or smell getting better or even if i smell better myself. I haven't had the sore throat or coughed up any black nasty stuff. I can even swear on my mother, that i didn't even have a single craving since i smoked my last cig.

Am i the only one here who just don't 'feel the difference'? Or is it just too early?

Have you guys heard this before?

I started smoking, about at least half a pack a day, since I was 17. Well, I'm 24 now and am turning 25 next month, and always told myself I'd quit before my 25th birthday. I heard from multiple sources that your 'lungs re-heal themselves until you're 25', but obviously I am skeptical of this. Have you guys heard anything along these lines before? Any insight would be much appreciated. Thank you!

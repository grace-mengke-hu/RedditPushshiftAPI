Why this craving now?

Out of the blue this evening I've gotten a reply bad craving, on the eve of my 2 week anniversary.

Its really strong and I can't explain it. I'll be alone all evening and that devil part of my brain is telling me I could go buy a pack and smoke one and throw the rest out and no one would know.

But I'd know.

I also really want a beer or even a shot would be awesome. I've drank very little since I quit (though not none at all) not because alcohol is a problem for me but it is a trigger.

Right now I just really want to sit on my porch with a smoke and beer.

Fuck.

Edit: I made it. Didn't smoke. I called up my girlfriend and invited myself over her place because I needed her support and she was happy to oblige.

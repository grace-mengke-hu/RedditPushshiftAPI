Father's day

Today, as predicted, there was an overwhelming amount of father's day related ridiculousness on my Facebook feed. I usually ignore it because I think it's a dumb holiday. But I noticed that a lot of my friends lost their dad's and posted sad messages; memories and old photos, and wishing he was around. And these were young dads; dad's that missed graduation and first jobs and marriage... my daughter is approaching 8 and I don't want to not be around. She's my favorite thing in the world. I've been lurking on this sub for a while and I think I'm ready. I need to stop.

A stopsmoking super success for one week

I'm so excited to say I have not smoked for one whole week! The triggers to smoke are still strong and I had a long hard battle with myself  when I needed to go grocery shopping, but I won that inner fight! Checking this subreddit every day is the only reason I've made it to a week. Thanks everyone on here!

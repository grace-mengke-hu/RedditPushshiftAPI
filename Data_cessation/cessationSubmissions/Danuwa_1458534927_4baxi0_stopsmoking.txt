Oxygen delivered Friday Quit day 3-21

I'm 45 years old and have been a pack a day + smoker for 34 years.  I've had cognitive issues off and on for a couple of years the on Oct 5th I suffered a stroke. My right side was mildly affected and I often forgot words but was rapidly improving.  I went to a psychiatrist because my concentration and ability to retain anything had worsened since the stroke along with my speech (forgetting words). She gave me mood stabilizers and antipsychotics which didn't help. 

Since I work from home and had a Fitbit I realized my heart rate was topping out at 160 just sitting at my desk. I saw my cardiologist Wednesday who put me on a heart monitor for two weeks but said my real problem was my oxygen levels and told me to see my pulmonologist ASAP.  I saw her Thursday and sure enough my O2 was in the low 80s. 

My Oxygen was delivered Friday. My quit day was Monday but I smoked my last one typing this.

I'm ashamed of myself.  I knew I was sick.  I knew I couldn't climb stairs.  I knew I couldn't breath well.  I knew I was getting dizzy every time I stood up. Now my ignorance will be on display for the entire worled to see in the form of tubes and oxygen tanks. 

Please put the cigarettes down ya'll.  So many people need you to be healthy.  I got to see my first grandson be born in August and I may only see him a few more times as my emphysema seems to be progressing rapidly (we'll see).  Just put the damn things down.

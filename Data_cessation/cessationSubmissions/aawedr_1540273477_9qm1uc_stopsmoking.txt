Need advice on how to quit

Hey guys, I used to smoke "poppers" (weed and tobacco) through bongs for a good 4 years. This year I have been living on my own, and have come to the realization that I am seriously addicted to nicotine. Since, I don't have access to a bong I just stopped smoking weed with no problems. But I now smoke cigarettes, and can't quit them for the life of me. 

I have read a lot of articles on quitting and stuff, and the many times I have tried .. I get the usual crankiness, "itch" to do something and can usually get by most of these through some mental fortitude.

But I CANNOT stop the urge to smoke a cigarette after I eat and have a full stomach. There have been a few times I have quit for weeks, and every time I relapse is because I could not say no to this urge. Can someone with a similar situation give any tips on how they got over this. Any help would be much appreciated.

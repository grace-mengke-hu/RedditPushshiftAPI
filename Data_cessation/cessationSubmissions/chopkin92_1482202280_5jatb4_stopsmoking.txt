Right guys, I really need some advice here...

So a week or so ago, I quit smoking. 
Full intention of never going back. 

And honestly I was doing pretty well. I got the cravings here and there, but I never seriously considered actually having one. 

The bitch is, every single time I have a drink I end up rationalising having one, and do. I haven't reset my badge because I always wake up hungover and guilty thinking that one slip up isn't going to reset me. 

But I'm sat here having got drunk and fucked up for the fourth time now, and it's getting easier to rationalise it every time. I never enjoy the cig after the first drag or two, but always cave.


So what do? 
Giving up booze at the same time as smoking would be realllly tough. All my social interactions revolve around booze, and I do use it as a form of stress relief, so honestly I'm just straight up stuck as what to do. Getting really bummed out that I'm evidently weak willed and constantly fucking up. 

Any advice, opinions or hard truths would mean the world, thanks. 



TL;DR
Can't help smoking when drunk, really like drink, really hate smoking.

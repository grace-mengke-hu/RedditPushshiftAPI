Any advice for dealing with large amounts of stress?

I'm a few days in here but right now my stress levels are through the roof due to college exams and other life events.  All I want to do is reward myself with a cigar or something when its all done tonight but I know I can't.  Anyone got any tips for powering through stress without smoking?

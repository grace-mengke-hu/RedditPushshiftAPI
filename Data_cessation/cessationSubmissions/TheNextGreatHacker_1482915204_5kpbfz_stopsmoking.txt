I need help getting my aunts (and uncle) to stop smoking

I really want to get them to stop smoking, and I do know that they all want to stop to. I think the difficult part for them is stopping. I know that quitting cold turkey won't work for them, so I came to this subreddit to ask for help. How should I approach this? Should I try and help wean them off cigarettes slowly or should I get them to vape first? And after that how do they quit vaping?

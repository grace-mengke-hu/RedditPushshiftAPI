Day 17 and doing quite well using the patch and gum. But should I be worried about my gum use?

I've noticed that I'm using the gum not just to get past cravings but at times simply because they feel good. For example, I chew the gum after my morning coffee and after meals as a matter of course. My plan is to do the 8-week course with the patch and be off the gum by the 90-day mark. I'm worried that I might get addicted to the gum. Advise!

Day #6, I made it through the weekend

I am now into day 6 of quitting. The cravings are getting substantially less, they are also lasting a lot less time and are not as strong as they were.

I am not craving that cigarette in the morning that I normally would. 

I was worried about how badly I would want to smoke during the weekend. Between going out and drinking and being around people who smoke, and the rest of the time when I would be smoking while gaming or watching stuff on tv.

I did crave, quite a lot actually, but found my craving was mostly boredom.

Last night I went to watch a movie with my wife at the cinema, and for the first time in what seems like as far back as I can remember, I managed to sit through an entire movie in a cinema without the thought crossing my mind that I need to smoke. This was awesome for me for a number of reasons, but probably most significant was the fact that I didn't feel the break in immersion in the movie. It is just one more thing that I add to my mental checklist of "Things I didn't realize non-smokers don't have to consider or deal with".

I have found that the longer that checklist gets, the easier resisting cravings and strengthening my resolve becomes.

Looking forward to writing my one week entry tomorrow. I feel proud of myself for making it this far.

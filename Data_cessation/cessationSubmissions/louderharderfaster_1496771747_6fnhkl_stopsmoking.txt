Day 4.

If I can do it, then anyone can do it. I'm not positive this quit will be my last but it sure feels like it. I've been meditating and something has clicked into place. Sure, I *want* a cigarette but I no longer want to be a smoker and somehow not wanting to be a smoker is beating the cravings. I can only give credit to meditation. 


I've tried hypnotherapy 3 times. I read Allan Carr's book at least 3 times. I've gone CT and I've tried tapering. I've made big announcements of my plan to quit and I've kept it to myself. I've tried the patch, the gum, the lozenges. 

I can't trust the self that smoked for 30 years to be the self that can quit but again, something clicked, or shifted, or changed in me in meditation that has brought me to day 4 without much effort. 

Just thought I would share! Good luck (to me) and all my fellow quitters for a smoke free summer!

Quitting today, thanks to a throat infection.

Well I'm finally going to try and give up smoking for good. I currently have a throat infection and find it hard to breathe, I hate it completely. So that got me thinking, why am I consciously smoking when I know eventually I'll find it hard to breathe. I'll be GIVING myself health complications. I don't want that. Ever. I want to be able to breathe. 

So here we go!

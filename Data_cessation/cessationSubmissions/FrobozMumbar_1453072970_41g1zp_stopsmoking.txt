Working on day 17

Howdy Reddit.  Long time lurker, first time poster.  Quit smoking around 4am on New Years Day.  Cold turkey.  Only way that ever worked for me.  I am 16 days in to my new smoke free life and it is tough.  I find myself drinking more.  Finding substitutes.  My appetite has improved a bit, senses are definitely sharper, but the huge challenge is what to do with my idle time when all I can think to do is light another smoke.  I know I can "white knuckle" for a while but I am very concerned I will fall back into my old habits without a change in my life.  Any veterans out there want to shed some light on what worked for you?

Something I have a hard time reconciling

So I've got to the point where i want to quit smoking. I'm realizing how it distanced me from my friends who didn't smoke and that I never should have started almost 10 years ago. 
I am.fighting a lot of shame and guilt about going on so long. When I quit, I start to feel I have to make up all that lost ground and become who I was before I started smoking. This is really hard on me and I keep beating myself up. Can anyone relate or offer some advice? Thank you!

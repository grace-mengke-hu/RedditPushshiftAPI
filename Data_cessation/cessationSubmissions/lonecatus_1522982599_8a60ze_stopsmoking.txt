Im going to need some help.

I am so ready to stop smoking, but have zero support. My boyfriend acts like it should be easy because he stopped cold turkey years before we had met. On top of that I haven't openly smoked around him in a few years, so I feel like I cant really even tell him that Im stopping now. Im open to any suggestions.Thanks!

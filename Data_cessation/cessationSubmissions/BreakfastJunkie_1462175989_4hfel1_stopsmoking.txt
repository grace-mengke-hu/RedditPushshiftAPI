Didn't see a FAQ link on the side bar.

I want to quit. U.S. here. Does anyone have any info about what they tell you or might send from the stop smoking commercials produced by the government? 

I'm 31.5. I started smoking when I was 14 and always told myself I'd stop when I was 32 or sooner if I had a child. No baby yet but I'm coming up on the other half of my plan. 

Any advice would be good and thank you in advance.

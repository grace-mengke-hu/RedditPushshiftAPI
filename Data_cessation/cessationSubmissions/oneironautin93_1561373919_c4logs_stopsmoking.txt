What are your tips and tricks for fighting off cravings?

I'm on day 9 now and still dealing with cravings. What are you doing to resist the urge to smoke? What are your cravings like? Mine are like waves, coming and going constantly, so it's really hard to fight it off. I'm constantly eating now to curb my anxiety, which isn't the best coping strategy, I know :(

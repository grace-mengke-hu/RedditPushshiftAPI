Allen Carr's Easyway to Stop Smoking

I don't know that this has been posted here before and even if it has I don't care. If you want to quit smoking I strongly suggest you go out and buy or download Allen Carr's Easyway to Stop Smoking book. I'm 1 month in and have never felt better. I knew prior to buying the book that I really wanted to quit. I came across the book on a whim doing a random stop smoking search on Amazon and there it was! I cannot say how thankful I am for this book. It doesn't teach you to use replacment nicotine therapies like the patch or e cigarettes. It teaches you the truth about smoking and how easy it is to stop . Everything you believe about smoking is bullshit. All the stigmas about how hard it is to quit, how much you'll suffer through withdrawal symptoms, etc, etc, etc. It's all a fucking lie. I'm sorry to be blunt but it's the truth. One of the most powerful messages in the book that sticks with me is the following: Don't think of quitting smoking as losing a good friend, but defeating a terrible enemy. What has smoking done for you? Nothing, absolutely nothing . What has it has taken from you? Everything. Your health, your money , and your confidence. You feel like if you stop that you'll be missing out on something or life won't be enjoyable anymore. That couldn't be farther from the truth. The weight I feel lifted off of my shoulders by becoming a non smoker is indescribable. I really hope someone will take my advice, buy the book, and then will let me know that it worked for them too. I promise I'm not salesmen. I just really had so much success with this book and I really want to help someone do the same. Even if just one person responds and tells me thank you, it would really make my day. Good luck everyone!

I want to stop smoking, desperately want to quit.

Hey guys, I desperately want to quit smoking. I live alone and handle a business by my own. I smoke around 7-8 cigarettes a day and I have been smoking since the last 6 years. I tried everything but the loneliness gets to me. I have one friend and we rarely meet because he handles his own work too. I live in one of the gulf countries and making a friend is very hard and thanks to my work its even tougher. 

The stress of work makes it even harder to quit smoking. I hate waking every morning and putting the cancer stick in my mouth. I am an Indian and my parents don't know I smoke and telling them is impossible. 

I've been following this subreddit for sometime and I really want to quit. Any answer is appreciated. 

Thank you for taking out time to read this post. Any answer is appreciated. :)

The stress got to me

This is my first time posting and this is probably just going to be a whole lot of venting so I apologize. 
Last week was incredibly stressful. I found out that I will have to move in a little over 30 days and my job let me know that I will not be hired again for the following school year. On top of all of that I am in a long distance relationship and I am now not quite sure when I will be able to go visit my partner again. All of this has brought up some mental health issues that I have been successfully coping with for 6 months now. Everything came rushing back and for some reason I immediately went back to smoking. I quit 43 days ago but I gave into the pressure. I feel like a failure. I am so disappointed and I feel like I can’t tell anyone for fear that they will be disappointed in me. I don’t want to keep doing this. How do I go on from here?

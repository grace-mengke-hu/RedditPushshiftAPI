How to know when your addicted

Simple question really, how can i know if i'm addicted to smoking or not? It started out casual, people giving me freebies at parties then it became slightly more frequent, meeting up with people occasionally where we would all hang and smoke, and the other day i bought my first pack. I really enjoy them and find them super relaxing and occasionally i do think to myself "yeah i could really do with a smoke" am i addicted? If i keep going will i be addicted?

Snus withdrawals, but no cravings?

I recently quit snusing last Friday (4\-5 pouches a day for about a year. 8mg per pouch). I've been having some pretty rough anxiety along with some depersonalization/derealization (DP/DR), but surprisingly little to no cravings.  


Day 1 \- Woke up feeling pretty anxious and it persisted throughout the day. Decided to leave work a little earlier. Little to no cravings for snus.  


Day 2 \- Anxiety is persistent. Feeling pretty foggy accompanied by a weird "everything seems unreal" sort of feeling. Definitely the DP/DR. Still no cravings

Day 3 \- Anxiety seemed to peek. Still feeling the DP/DR. Went to a friends house that night but had to leave because I felt like I was going to have a panic attack (I didn't). I managed to calm down when I got home. Managed to fall asleep at a decent time (11:30)

Day 4 (today) \- Anxiety is certainly nowhere near as bad as it got yesterday. Still feeling pretty hazy/foggy. Hopefully It'll go away soon. Still having little to no desire for snus. Guess that's a good thing.

Anyone here have any snus withdrawal stories they'd like to share? I'm particularly interested in hearing some of the anxiety symptoms you guys experienced and how long they usually lasted. It's manageable but it's been taking a toll on me these last few days. The only thing I'm looking forward to now is being able to feel like myself again.

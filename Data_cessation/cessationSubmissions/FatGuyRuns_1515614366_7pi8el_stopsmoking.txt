That awkward moment when your body starts walking toward your old smoking area...

Since quitting over six months ago using the Allen Carr Easy Way, I have almost never had a true desire to pick up a cigarette. This morning, however, while doing something rather routine at work, I found myself putting on my coat and walking toward the stairwell that leads out to my old smoking area.

I haven't been down that stairwell in six months. It's not a convenient way to get to anything but the smoking area. I also don't know why I put on my coat; I do not go outside for any reason during the day now that I don't smoke (and rarely would I have put on a coat back then, as I live in Southern California.)

Our bodies and our subconscious minds really do some devious things to trip us up sometimes.

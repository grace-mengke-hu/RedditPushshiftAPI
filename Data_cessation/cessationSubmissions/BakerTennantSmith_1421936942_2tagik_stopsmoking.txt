Finally, no cravings at all!!

I'm on Day 13 and I am so happy. Not a single craving at all. I can think about it, see it on tv, see the discarded cigarettes in the cigarette tin at the gas station .  .. nada! It feels so good to go about my day and smoking doesn't enter my mind. 

I'm extra proud because I was incredibly stressed yesterday because someone I care about had to go to the hospital for a pretty big procedure yesterday. Smoking to "relieve" stress didn't even occur to me. This morning, as I was waiting for my coffee to brew, it occurred to me: This is what a non-smoker feels like all of the time. That's me now. 

It was a wonderful feeling. I seriously never knew quitting smoking could have such an impact on me but it has. I'm actually calmer now that I've quit than I was when I smoked. Just further proof that smoking truly had no real benefits. 

Now to realize that I don't need sweets every day since there are no cravings and start eating healthy. :)

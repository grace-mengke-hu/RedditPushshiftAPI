Hey everyone! I quit 3 days ago and I feel extremely confident!

I quit at 2:00 am on January 8th and have not smoked a smoke since! I've been smoking nearly 6 years at the age of 21. It makes me hurt thinking of 15 year old me smoking, not realizing the harm that would be inflicted on their future self. 

My whole family smokes, my whole workplace smokes, most of my friends smoke. But I'm proud to say I'm drunk around these people right now and the thought of a square even on my 4th day clean makes me want to puke. Thank you r/stopsmoking for helping me stop this nasty habit.

I'm posting for the sheer fact that if I smoke I honestly can't show my face on Reddit ever again. Please hold me to this fellow quitters. 

Thanks for all the support you give to everyone trying to rid themselves of this disease!

Sorry for the formatting I'm on mobile and drunk not a good combo.

Quitting on Monday

I've had it. I miss being in good health. The last couple days I have felt like absolute SHIT. I am quitting on Monday. This is my second attempt to quit in the 7 years I have been smoking. The first time, I only made it 1 day. I am a little worried and scared though. I dont want it to effect my performance at work and school. Should I get nicotine gum? The patch? I just want my lungs back. I feel so gross.

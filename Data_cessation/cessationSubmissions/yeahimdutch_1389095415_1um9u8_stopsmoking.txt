Curious, how long did you guys smoke? and what was the effect of smoking on you? for example diseases?

I smoked for 7 to 8 years, I read some pretty bad stories around here of people suffering bad lungs. It makes me glad I decide to stop, right now.

Edit: I feel like this is a lottery some people smoke 20 years without getting anything. Others smoke less and have diseases. Fuck this I'm not buying any lottery tickets anymore!

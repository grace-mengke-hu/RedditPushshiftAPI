Struggling to not relapse...thoughts on herbal cigarettes?

Like my badge says, I'm 49 days in so I think I'm not so much experiencing the effects withdrawal from a physical addiction, but more the effects of the mental part of it. I'm in college and as usual, I'm more stressed and more tired than normal and this is when I'd usually turn to cigarettes to help me out. I'm craving harder now than I was about a week or two into quitting. I'm wondering if you guys have had similar experiences with this, or if you guys think herbal cigarettes might help. Any advice is appreciated, thanks!

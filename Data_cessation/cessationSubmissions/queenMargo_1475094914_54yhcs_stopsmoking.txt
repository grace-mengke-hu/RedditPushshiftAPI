At the beginning

First day was yesterday. Using patches and nicotine chewing gum. 
I'm ok during day time, apart from being constantly hungy.
But during the evening I am absolutely dying for a cigarette. The thought of having everything done, of a finished day and going outside for that ciggie is so so so tempting. :(

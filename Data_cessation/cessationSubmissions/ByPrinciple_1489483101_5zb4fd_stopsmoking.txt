Migraine lasting 3 days after quiting?

Out of curiosity has everyone felt this symptom of withdrawl? Im also curious if anyones has lasted as long or longer. I found some info online that 2 days in its not uncommon for headaches, but is there any reason it would last 3 straight days? Not an exageration, been bed ridden taking migraine pills. Was a smoker for 3 years ended at a pack a day. Thanks for any help.

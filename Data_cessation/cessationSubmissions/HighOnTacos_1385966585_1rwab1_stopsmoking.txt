I need help to quit... But I dont know if I'm serious enough.

I've only been smoking 3 years... I just found this sub, and just reading a few posts made me crave a cigarette. 

I feel like I had a good introduction, in my head, to write, but I forgot it, because I was suddenly afraid of the thought of not smoking.

I really wish I could restrict myself to being an occasional cigarette smoker, but I know that I can never have tobacco within reach without smoking nonstop.

I just don't know where to start.

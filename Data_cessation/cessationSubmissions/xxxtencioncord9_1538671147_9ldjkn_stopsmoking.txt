Did anyone else notice that they feel much happier and less anxious off nicotine?

Not at the peak of withdrawal but once its gone. I used to think that nicotine made me happier when in fact it was the main cause of my depression and anxiety. I now feel a much more natural sense of happiness and connected to the world around me. Caffeine also seems to have a much more enjoyable effect now.

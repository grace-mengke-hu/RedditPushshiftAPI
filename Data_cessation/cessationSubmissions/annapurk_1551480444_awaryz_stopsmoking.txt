Update on relaps after quitting for 3 years

Made a post here 2 weeks ago about how i fell back into smoking after quitting three years ago. I ended my relationship and thought smoking just one cigaret would help with the pain. Of course.... Even after 3 years not even thinking about smoking it can come and trick me into thinking that one cigaret wouldn't hurt me. I was so wrong, because here i am smoking about 5 to 10 cigarettes a day these last 2 weeks. I felt misserable and the pain from the break up is still there of course! But last night I decided to cut the bullshit and not use my break up as an excuse to smoke again and i'm proud to say that i haven't smoked today! First 24 hours without smoking and i'm super happy i made it. 1 day at the time right? This sub has helped me a lot so thank you for everything! 

TLDR: fell back into smoking two weeks ago after 3 years of being clean and had my first smoke free day today!

I relapsed and came for help here.

I was smoking for almost a year. The first two weeks I wasn't smoking alot, but I became a pack-a-day smoker.
I  tried to quit earlier but with no success because all of my friends smoke, almost everyone at school smokes. There are way more smokers than non-smokers in my city. It is seen as being normal.
So I decided to stop it for health reason (i got bronchitis), even tho it got treated, docs told me that it would come back if I don't stop.
I hadn't had a single puff for 46 hours. Those were the most hellish hours of my life. I had intense brain fog and anxiety, I had dreams about smoking cigarettes. But I made up my mind that I won't smoke. I declined offers from classmates and friends. And I even started to breathe better.
All of that until about 20 mins ago. I ate some fruit and stole a cig from my parents and went to the bathroom. Had a minute of dragging on an unlit cig and then i lit it up.. I fucking relapsed. What should I do now ?

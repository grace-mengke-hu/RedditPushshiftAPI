You can do this!!!

I quit smoking a little over 5 years ago. I used the patch, I know it seems hard, sometimes impossible but you can do it! I struggled with smoking for 20 years and one morning I kept hacking crap up out of my lungs, I knew I had to do something. 
 I tried the gum, cold turkey and finally the patch worked but it was more of a mindset thing also. I told myself that wasn’t the only thing I was going to change, I wanted to also get in shape. So every time, then until now because the cravings still hit me from time to time, I crave a cigarette I’ll go for at least a 15 minute walk to stop and reflect. 
 I know this sounds cliche but if I can do it, anyone can. You got this! Never give up! I believe in you and you should always believe in yourself.

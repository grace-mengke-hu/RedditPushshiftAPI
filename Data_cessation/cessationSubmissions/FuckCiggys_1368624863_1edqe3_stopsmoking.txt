One Year Later: The one key for me for staying quit = DON'T CHEAT

I attribute my staying quit to not cheating. It's that simple, for me. I had no problems as long as I didn't try to justify a reason why I could have one ciggy, or one puff.

I learned from past mistakes. This time was it.

Now - what to look forward to? Well. I put on some weight after quitting and am starting to cut that in a rigorous martial arts program, and this second smoke-free summer is going to be full of outdoor activities.

I relish the freedom from the stinky fuckers. Really - it's worth quitting just to lose that fucking pervasive smell. If you smoke now, run your ciggy fingers under some nice, hot water and whiff them fingers. How's that smell? That's what you smell like from 20 feet away. How can you wear deodorant or cologne / perfume while you smoke? It totally can't even stand up to the shitty ciggy smell.

There is freedom out there, but you will have to work for it. Make a list of reasons to quit and use that to talk yourself out of smoking. That list will not change much, and neither should your resolve to stay quit.

Quitting was made easy for me by a brief stint with the patch and reading and posting here. I attribute the initial success to those two things. 

Thanks, /r/stopsmoking for saving me $1,800 and giving me the freedom to move on with a healthy lifestyle without feeling like everything I do is worthless.

Fuck you, ciggys. Fuck you hard. You ain't my friend and I won't touch you ever again.

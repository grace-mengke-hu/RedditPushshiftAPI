3 months, bitches. boom goes the dynamite.

If you're trying to quit, just quit. Today. It's a lot easier and a lot more difficult than you're imagining. But you CAN do it. I smoked for about 25 years. Every day. Now just 90 days out it seems like a distant memory. Like some weird thing I used to do and I don't quite remember why or why I thought it was so important.

It's a pain in the ass, but you'll be fine. Nobody ever died from not having cigarettes.

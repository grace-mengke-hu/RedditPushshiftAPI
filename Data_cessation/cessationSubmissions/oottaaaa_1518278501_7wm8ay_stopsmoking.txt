Started smoking more when I quit drinking. Time to cross another vice off the list.

I quit drinking ~4 months ago. I started smoking more to compensate. I've never been a very heavy smoker, but it's been hard for me quit long-term. I seldom smoke more than a pack a week, and I regularly go days or even weeks without smoking. But something always brings me back. I think having some accountability and engagement with this community will help me stick to my long-term goals of not smoking at all anymore.

Can we stop the posts that are only app screenshots?

About half of posts on here are just people posting a title like "It's possible!" or "I did it!", with nothing else but a SmokeFree screenshot. There's no text posted, no sharing what got them there, no techniques or successes described. Granted, I'm in a bad mood today so maybe I'm being harsh, but I wish there would be more posts of substance, anything at all.

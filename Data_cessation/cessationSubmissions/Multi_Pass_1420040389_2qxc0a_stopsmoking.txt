Congratulations New years resolution class of 2013!

It has been a year since I and many others made the pledge to quit smoking. Congrats to those of us that made it this far! It isn't over but the worst is behind us now!

To anyone that didn't make it or is planning on this year being the year for them good luck and keep persevering. It is worth it.

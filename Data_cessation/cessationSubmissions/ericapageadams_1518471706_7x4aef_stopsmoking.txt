Having to quit unexpectedly

Went to doctor today, found out I have chronic bronchitis and need to stop smoking if I ever plan on getting better. I've been thinking about quitting lately, but I guess this was the reassurance I needed. I quit cold turkey when I was pregnant, gonna try that again. Wish me luck ðŸ˜³

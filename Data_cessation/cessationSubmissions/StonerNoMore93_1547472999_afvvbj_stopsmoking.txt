“Sometimes it is the people no one imagines anything of, who do the things no one can imagine”

Today I hit two weeks without smoking for the first time since starting 6 years ago. Last night I had a craving that lasted at least an hour but I made it through and the feeling of pride and accomplishment from sticking with my quit far outweighs any pleasure I would have gotten from smoking. 

When I quit first people laughed at me and nobody really expected me to see it out. I have never been more determined to do anything in my life and am confident with the courage gained from reading other people’s stories that I will never touch another cigarette in my life. 

Keep going people, choose life ✌🏻

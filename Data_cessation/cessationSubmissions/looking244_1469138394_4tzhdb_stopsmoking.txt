What gives you a little lift?

I quit smoking for about 10 months and heavily relied on food to do so. I gained around 60 lbs during that time and then I started smoking again 10 weeks ago and have been steadily losing that weight. I quit again yesterday and suddenly I'm eating everything in sight. I was wondering if anyone has found something that gives you a pick me up throughout the day that isn't food? Or is it possible for me to quit both?

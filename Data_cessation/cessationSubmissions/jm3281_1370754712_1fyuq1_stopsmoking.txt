Stopped Smoking and started tracking the monetary value and got motivated

I am 33yo and have quit smoking before. It has never lasted long. 

This time I started tracking the monetary value of quitting. The price per cigarette. I am motivated like never before now. Watching my dollar value rise with each hour, and each day. There is nothing like it. 

Just wanted to pop in and state that I am quitting and hold myself accountable.

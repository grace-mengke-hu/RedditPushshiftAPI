63 Days in and here is what I have learned

I like being smoke free. I like smelling of clementine body lotion as opposed to air freshener to mask the odor of cigarettes. I like being able to fully taste strawberry shortcakes and blueberries. I like sneezing from allergies because my nose can finally pick up pollen from flowers. I like being at that place in my life where I am not dependent on cigarettes and that I can now control stress through other means. I like that I can go to a bar with friends, have a few drinks, be around smokers, and not even flinch. It's been one hell of a roller coaster ride these past 2 months. I know I'm not (and may never be completely) out of the woods just yet, but I am feeling more in control of my life. I feel happy. I feel better. I feel like I can beat this thing full force. Every time I get a craving, it lasts for a solid 30 seconds before it's killed and I start thinking about something else. For those of you just starting out, don't give up. I know it seems like it will be impossible, but you can do this. It will get easier to manage and slowly, but surely, things will eventually get better. 

P.S. If you're in the U.S.: Happy Independence Day! And if you're anywhere else: Happy Weekend!

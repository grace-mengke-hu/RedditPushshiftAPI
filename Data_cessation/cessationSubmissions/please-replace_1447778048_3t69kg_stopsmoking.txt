Got drunk and relapsed

My SO and myself had some bad news concerning the recent atrocity and both got drunk on Sunday night and had some cigarettes.  I'm not letting this stop me stopping thou!  I'd not smoked since October 1st.  It's now day 2 again and I'm going to be strong.  Smoking is not a crutch it's a makes things worse.

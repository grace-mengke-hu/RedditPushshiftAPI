Quit smoking but drinking even more?

Hi guys,

I've been smoking for the last 4 years and I decided to quit three days ago (let's be honest, not the first time). I've always been a "fast" drinker but I went out last night and I must have drunk more than 8 beers in less than two hours...

Is it stress? What shall I do?

Cheers

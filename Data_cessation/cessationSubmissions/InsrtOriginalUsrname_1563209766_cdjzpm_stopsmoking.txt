I'm frustrated with my mom.

My mom stopped smoking for almost a year. However, at our 4th of July party, she had some cigarettes with her friends. She said she would only do it that night, but now she has completely regressed to smoking multiple times a day. Fortunately, she knows she screwed up, and is taking medicine and working on quitting. My question is, how do I help her? I don't want her to go through this every year, but I don't know how to help. Any input would be welcome.

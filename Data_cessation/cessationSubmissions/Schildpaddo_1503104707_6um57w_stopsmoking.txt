Happy confession

So, I am not the type to post anything usually. But I'm making an exception today because I feel so good about feeling like shit right now. Let me explain:
After 3,5 months of successfully quitting I just grabbed my dad's tobacco (he already went to bed), rolled one, and lit it. I don't really know why, I just did. After a few drags though.. man.. my body just rejected the stuff. I started feeling nauseous, dizzy, sick, thirsty, down and grossed out in general. When I destroyed that cigarette I felt an incredible wave of  relief of not having to breathe that bloody death-air anymore. I drank two pints of water and went straight to bed.
That's when I realised I'm glad I feel like shit. And that was also the moment I decided to make this post.

I don't need and/or want to smoke. Huuergh.

Edit: I don't want to encourage anyone to try a cigarette to see if you hate it. Just don't. You can do it. I had a minor screw up but I'll continue to be a non smoker and do my best to never inhale that devil stank.

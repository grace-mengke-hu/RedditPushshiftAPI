Money saved going to snacks instead..

Up until last week, I was a pack a day smoker, but where I live a pack of 20 is about 4 USD. I'm really happy I've quit, but I end up spending even more money on replacements i.e. a can of coke and a bag chips is the same price as a whole pack. I can enjoy a pack 20 times and a snack once for 5 minutes for the same price. Does anyone have any other replacement ideas? Day 7 Cold Turkey. Feeling great in general. Cravings come and go but my mantra is "just don't" and it passes.

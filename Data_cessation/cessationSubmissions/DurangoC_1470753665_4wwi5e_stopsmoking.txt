Relapsed after two months. Does withdrawal start over completely?

I don't know what happend these past few days but I made a huge mistake. I quit cold turkey nearly two months ago and I slipped up and have had nearly 15 cigarettes in the past three days. I was doing so good and smoking no longer was even desirable anymore and for some strange horrendous reason I went and bought a pack.

Should I expect withdrawal to come back full force? I didn't sleep a wink last night as I was on edge which I assume was the nicotine withdrawal. I don't know if I can put myself through this all over again.

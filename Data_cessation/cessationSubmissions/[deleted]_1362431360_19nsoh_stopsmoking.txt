Today is a good day to quit!

Life seems to good to waste one cigarette a time, so I've decided to quit smoking today! I've smoked the last cigarette I will ever smoke! I bought some gum to tide me over on the oral fixation and have lots of water and a clear schedule to sleep if I need to or lots of movies and shit to go over whilst locked in my room!

WIsh me luck, /r/stopsmoking!

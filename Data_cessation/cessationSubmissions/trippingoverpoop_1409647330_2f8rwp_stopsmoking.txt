Quitting smoking when I wake up at 12 today. 8 hours from now!

I've bee smoking for two years. Started out smoking clove cigar(ettes?) turned into a habit through freshman year of college. I've been smoking a pack a day. Coming from a line of people  on both parents sides who were tobacco smokers, who all died of lung cancer, I'm inspired to be the one to carry on my genes. I have no friends to encourage me to stop so I turned to you guys. If someone wanted to text me and ask me how  doing with it feel free to PM me and I'll give you my number. Here we go!

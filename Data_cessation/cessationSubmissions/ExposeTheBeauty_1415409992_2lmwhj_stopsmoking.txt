I quit a year ago, afraid I'll start up again

I was forced to quit smoking last October when I got pregnant with my baby girl.  She's nearly five months old now and she's still breastfeeding. 

I didn't quit because I *wanted* to quit.  I quit for my daughter.  I'm afraid that once she's done breastfeeding I'll start smoking again.  Especially since the biggest reason why I'm not smoking right now is still for her.  I don't want to contaminate her milk supply.  

I guess, I'm hoping for reasons to stay quit when I still have the desire to smoke.  I'm not physically addicted to the nicotine, but mentally, I sometimes still feel like a  smoker.

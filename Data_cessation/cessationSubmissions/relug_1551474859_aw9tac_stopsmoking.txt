Use Notebook or Evernote on Your Phone

Yesterday, I was at dinner with my friends who are really really smoke a lot. I'm smoke free for 9 days by the way. First time since I quit, very strong craving hit me on this table.

At the begining of quitting, I wrote down notebook on my phone why I quit and which dangers will wait me and how can act against these dangers and how can beat cravings.

Not motivational quotes from someone. Just my words and dialogue wtih myself about cravings in these notes.

Use this method. Get used to look your notes when craving hits. 

Love you guys!

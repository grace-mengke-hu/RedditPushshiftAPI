Going to be hard when my roommate still does...

It's day 2.  I have read Allen Carr, and that was super motivating.  I won't smoke again as cigs are disgusting and pointless.  However, my roommate still smokes and I want to know if anyone has had to deal with this - the smell is always there tempting and it just makes it extra hard, you know?

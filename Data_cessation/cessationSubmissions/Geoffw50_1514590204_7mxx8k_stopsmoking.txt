Treat yourself with what you save

Nearly 3 months and survived several office parties over Christmas. Love telling people I'm a NON SMOKER.... had a spending spree at Hugo Boss today (2 suits and shirts for work) and motivated to be back in the store next month to buy some casual clothes for the spring.  Not cheap clothes but more affordable now I don't have a killer habit to feed. One of the tips that motivated me in the early days was to put the money I would spend on smoking to one side and then treat myself with what i save. Looking forward to more treats.

What treats are you enjoying with what you're saving?

275 days gone!

Just like that I have to reset my badge yet again. 
  

Fucking finals week! Lol.
  

But at any rate, I have some new insight for myself...the longer I stay quit, the easier it is to stay quit.
  

BUT, if I slip up and life falls apart and I derail and start smoking again, the SOONER I cease smoking again the easier it is.
  

A few weeks ago I broke down and started chain smoking. Finals, family problems, anxiety, hormones, etc all came piling down on top of me in a perfect storm of shit. 
   

I smoked ruthlessly after not having had a single cig in over nine months....and having been mostly a non smoker for well over two and a half years. I chain smoked, snuck out when my son was sleeping, I even made my parents watch my son so I could go outside and smoke. I felt guilty as all hell.  
  

I reeked, my brain felt like it was in a state of uber-anxiety, and I felt like a terribly emotionally absent parent. 
  

After successfully lasting five days after this terrible two weeks of chain smoking, horrible moods, I successfully quit again. I was cranky, irritable and always angry. Then, on day six, I had yet another fight with my s.o., and smoked again for another day. 
  

This time, I was able to stop myself before I let it snowball out of control. I smoked for just the one day, and then I went back to not smoking again the next day. So I have been smoke free for 7 of the last 8 days. My second time quitting was much easier, I had no irritability, my resolve was stronger (probably because I didn't want to go through the torture of having to quit again).
  

At any rate, here I am, back to an honest square one but with lots more experience behind me and two years' worth of healthy lungs to back me up.  
  
  

....constant vigilance, friends. A cigarette will NEVER solve your problems, they only create more on top.

After smoking a pack or more a day for 10 years. I have gone 2 months without a cigarette or nicotine in any form, I owe it all to this sub.

I never thought I would be able to honestly type that. Nicotine has claws that run deep and make quitting seem impossible. The community of /r/stopsmoking not only illustrated to me how possible it is, but brought to me the realization of the amount of satisfaction you get from conquering this addiction. I'm still in the early stages, but to all the early quitters out there, it gets SO much easier.  

Thank you all.

Weed not cigs

Day 6 now. Smoked a lil weed last night because I'm rationalizing in my brain I'm still not smoking cigs. I'm not a person that gets high regularly, literally last time I did was over a year ago. Still having massive cravings and thinking smoking something/anything but cigs make me feel somewhat OK. I know this sounds insane, and I've genuinely been feeling since I quit more insane as the days go by. Anyone else out there doing this or something like it? I wish I had a more definitive answer as to when these damn cravings will stop!!

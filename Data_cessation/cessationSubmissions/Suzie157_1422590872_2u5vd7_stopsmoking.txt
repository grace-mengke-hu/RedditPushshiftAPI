Why is it still hard?

I'm almost 50 days into quitting. I thought things would be better by now. 

I read Carr's book. It was fantastic. I REALLY understand that there was so little that I actually enjoyed about smoking--the nag to be anti-social, the terrible smell, and the constant need for a bump up a few hours after every cig. I did not like being a smoker and I felt trapped.

But I still miss it. I don't even know why I miss it. I just WANT a cigarette with no consequences--even though I know it doesn't do *anything* for me. I don't even think they smell good anymore. And the thought of having one has been gnawing at me consistently--especially at times when I used to smoke every day (walking to work, walking from work, walking to lunch, out at a bar with friends, etc). It's like while I cognitively know it won't do anything for me, and physically I'm certainly not addicted to nicotine anymore, I still love the *idea* of smoking. 

Anyone else go through this after quitting for more than a month? It's awful. I just want to stop *thinking* about it. Ugh.

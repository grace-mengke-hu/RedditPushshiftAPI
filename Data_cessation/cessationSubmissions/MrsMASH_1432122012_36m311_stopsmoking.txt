Had an honest conversation with myself last night..

Around this time every year since I was 18, I say I'm going to get healthy. I have all these grandiose plans. Diet, working out, no smoking, no drinking...

Last night... I just... I don't know. I realized I make so many excuses. I don't have a enough support--- I'm too stressed--- I don't have the time--- I don't have any willpower.

Well. I know all of that is a crock of shit.

1. I have probably the greatest support system out there between my husband, kids, and friends.
2. What on earth do I have to be stressed about? I am actually pretty blessed with everything I have.
3. Don't have the time to NOT die?
4. No willpower:: yeah---hooookay. I quit Heroin 3 years ago cold turkey with no aid... I pushed out two babies with no epidural... I know these are not the same thing-- but it shows the range.. (this one is just meant to be like--- STFU you big complainer.)

I also realized--- these are all choices.

So. I woke up at 6 AM. It is now 7:36 AM. I am CHOOSING not to smoke. I already made it through the first 8 hours, thanks to sleep. I just need to continue on that path.

My plan for the next 7 days is:: icepops, candies, and exercise. 

I think I kid myself that everything is going to run smoothly. I know it may not. But--- this'll be the first time I actually put EFFORT into it.

Good luck to everyone-- you can do it. I can too.

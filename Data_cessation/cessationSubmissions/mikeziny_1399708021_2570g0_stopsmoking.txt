Today is my day 21 being free

As the title says it has been 3 weeks  since i stopped. And i must say it feels incredible. I feel free, i got rid off that constant nervous feeling, i can smell the spring (ad basicly anything again) , i can taste things, i can catch my breath after some sports and this is just a short list of things that improved in just 3 weeks. 

On the other hand i spared my body from 420 ciggaretes, saved 75,6â‚¬(money is the smallest thing but it counts as well). 

I am really happy and i think i have every reason to be =)

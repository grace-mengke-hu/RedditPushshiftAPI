Toughest day???

Hi, I've been a smoker for 6 years who smoked around 10 cigs per day and decided to quit cold turkey couple days ago. Right now I'm on Day 2 of a long journey ahead. I would really like to know whether is the first few days the toughest it will get? Or there will still be more tougher moments???

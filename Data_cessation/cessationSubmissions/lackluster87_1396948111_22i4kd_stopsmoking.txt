missing standing at the window each night

so ive stopped smoking after reading that allen carr book (brilliant and recommended), only two weeks since so far... last night i had a really bad day and in a 'i cant care' moment, lit one up and finished it... i can say that i didnt enjoy the smoke itself, but i enjoyed the moment of calm where i could stop stressing and just listen to the night outside

i cant justify opening the window and sticking my head into the cold every night, has anyone had a similar experience? is there anything youd recommend to help replace the ritual?

Feeling a bit more confident this time.

I've attempted quitting countless times. I was only smoking for a year, and even the amount of money over that year spent on cigarettes/tobacco disgusts me. I could've had so much more money if I didn't bother in the first place.

Anyway, I'm halfway through Allen Carr's *audiobook*, and I have just put out what I hope to be my last cigarette. I'm wondering, is it still good to finish the audiobook while I'm not smoking, or is it an underlying "rule" to carry on smoking while going through it?

I realize that this post is a bit contradicting towards the title, oops!

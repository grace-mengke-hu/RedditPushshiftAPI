Just dropping by to say TWO MONTHS DUDES

The flair don’t lie. And, also, I’ve achieved this while moving house twice, breaking up with my husband and changing jobs. 

The most helpful thing I learned was to tell myself “a cigarette won’t change anything”. As in - it won’t make you less stressed, less sad, or improve your life. So you don’t need it. Keep going, my dudes! You can do it!

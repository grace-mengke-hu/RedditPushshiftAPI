I slipped today, but....

I hated it! The taste was disgusting. I got a headache even though I only had three drags. Worst mistake I could have made because I haven't to redo my first three days. It was also the best mistake because it showed me that I really don't need cigarettes afterall. My lungs feel heavy, and it's just another great reminder as to why I'm choosing to quit.  Just wanted to share. Thank you if you read this!

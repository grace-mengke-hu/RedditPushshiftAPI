Can't stress how good badges are!

I see a lot of people on here who are quitting without actually using the badge/flair system. It's really easy it shows you how to do it right in the side bar, and trust me, its worth it. I probably would have started again had it not been for my badge, i just come here and get an instant reminder of how far I've come. Seriously. If you dont have a badge, get one!

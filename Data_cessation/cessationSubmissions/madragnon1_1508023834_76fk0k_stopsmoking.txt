Hit the 1 month mark after many, many tries!

So I'm someone who smoked socially for a few years, then smoked hard core for about 5...got pregnant and quit for 2 years, then relapsed. And since then it's been on again, off again for the past 10 years (man, those years just slip away, don't they?) My next "real" quit date was always on the horizon, but it was never the right time-- too much work stress, too much home stress, etc etc. A BIG stumbling block for me is always the constipation- which sounds funny, but after not going for days on end, and trying EVERYTHING short of cigs to get things moving again, I'd resort to lighting up.
So what was different this time? Honestly, I just realized that this was it: if I didn't actually stick to this quit, I was going to spend the rest of my life in this cycle, which would result in years of self-loathing. Trying to hide ciggie breath from other parents at school. Worried about bringing the stink into my kids bedrooms when I tucked them in. Feeling awful every time I finished off another pack. Weirdly, this month started easy for me (because I was too sick to smoke the first 3 days of my quit) and finished hard; I was alone all weekend, which is usually my cue to pop a bottle of wine, buy a few packs, and binge watch some shows. Instead, I tried to fully book myself with activities. Haven't had a drink all month, which also helped. And this time really does feel different. 
Anyway, stick with it. Can't tell you how good it felt to open my quit app this morning and see that 1 month badge.

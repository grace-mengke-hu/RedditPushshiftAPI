Two issues persist

1) I have a headache. I haven't done anything about it yet, but I will take a Tylenol the next chance I get. I don't want to have another coffee, because that is a horrible idea.2) Identity. The habit was such a big part of who i was, in my mind. I feel like im 21 again, and I've been given an opportunity to redefine myself. I also feel lost, like i did when i was 21.

It very rarely even crosses my mind to smoke anymore

Just wanted to share something about my experience that is the opposite of what I believed when I was originally trying to quit.  I'm about three years in now and it very rarely crosses my mind to smoke, or even that cigarettes exist.  The reason that I'm posting it is that I didn't ever really expect to get to this point where they were just kind of irrelevant to me and I first noticed it around the middle of the second year without them.  I'll keep my guard up because it'd be foolish not to but I just wanted to let others who are trying know that this "phase" exists where not smoking is just....wll it's just effortless :)

oh man...

first day, I can't sleep and already feel like giving up.
but don't worry /r/stopmoking, I will prevail!
I hope. haha.

edit: oh man, I had the weirdest dreams, goddamn nicotine patches

edit2: day 2 and hereby I declare that I give up. I give up trying to sleep, lol, it's no good. I almost fell asleep and a freaking mosquito woke me up, can you believe that?
the good news is, that I totally feel like not smoking, if the day tomorrow will be as easy as today, I will have mastered the first three days like a **champ**!

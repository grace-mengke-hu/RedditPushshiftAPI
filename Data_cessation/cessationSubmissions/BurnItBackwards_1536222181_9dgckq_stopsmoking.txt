One week down but I feel like I'm losing it

Hi guys,

This sub has been very helpful in inspiring me to quit. I finally did it a week ago,  but I guess I've depended for so long on tobacco that I don't know how to cope without it.  I'm having the worst depression and anxiety that I've had in years.  I've cried every night for the last four nights, and I never cry.  

Did anyone else go through this? Any advice?  

I almost feel like giving up at this point.

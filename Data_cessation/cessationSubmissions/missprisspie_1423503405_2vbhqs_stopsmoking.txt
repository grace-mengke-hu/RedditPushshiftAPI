First time ever posting

I have been on reddit for about a year. Only made an account a few months ago. Too shy to comment more than once. Ugh. Even this is ridiculously hard. I am a 30 yr old woman, and I've been smoking since I was about 13. I have wanted to quit for a long time, but was never brave enough. My husband even happily agreed to quit with me. (He is awesome). We quit for two days, and then I broke down, crying hysterically, and smoked again. He is doing great, feeling great, supportive and non judgemental as heck.....and I am back at square one. Feeling like crap. In all honesty, feeling like a no willpower having loser. I am quitting again. I just don't feel very hopeful. Reddit, I need your help. Any advice, tips, encouragement.....hell, any funny stories you'd like to share? Help me reddit!

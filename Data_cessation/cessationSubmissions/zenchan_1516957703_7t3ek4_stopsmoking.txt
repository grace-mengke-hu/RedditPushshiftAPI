Initiating attempt 4, hoping this one lasts

I started smoking at 17

Quitting attempt 1 at 21. Stayed clean for 1 month

Attempt 2 at 29. Stayed clean for 8 years.

Attempt 3 at 38. Stayed clean for 1 week

Now initiating attempt 4. I hope this is going to be the final one.

The longest I quit was shortly before my first child was born. Now after separation, I started again. Now I am sneaking around my kids hoping they don't find out that I smoke. But it's getting tiring and makes me feel like a scumbag. 

I have all the reasons to quit, know the feeling of being smoke free. I've successfully done it before. But somehow I feel weak and it's hellish difficult to push myself through it. Also perhaps because I don't really cherish my life so much anymore. I keep thinking, "meh, what's the point..."

It's all so stupid. Everytime I smoke, the biggest thought in my head is how much I want to quit. It's like I have two sides within me, one sensible and the other indifferent. 

I hope I can stay strong and not fail again.

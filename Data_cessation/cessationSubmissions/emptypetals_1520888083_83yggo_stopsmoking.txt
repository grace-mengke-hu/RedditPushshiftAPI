This fuckin sucks

I've only smoked for a couple of months every few years. I quit cold turkey every time and so far this one is the worst.

My chest became tight immediately and it feels like I'm being stabbed every time I pick up something, breathe, move, LIVE, etc.

Happened last time and lasted a damn 2 months. I HATE IT.
A cigarette makes the tightness go away how messed up is that...

Now I have a mouth ulcer from the stress quitting is causing me.

I know it'll get better but even being slightly sick makes life 1,000 times harder for me. I won't leave my room or bed until this all goes away and I feel fine again. It'll be months again I know it.

I'm so frustrated!

Day One: What do I do now?

I miss my Camel Crushes. I miss smoking when walking alone. I can't go to parties/raves anymore because I'm too vulnerable to smoking. I hate myself. I hate how I can smoke up to a pack and feel so floored (I'm lightweight) that I start acting stoned. I hate how cigarettes are like that sadistic girlfriend you have to break up with. The friend that "loves" you but secretly drains your bank account. Smoking, can't live with it, can't live without it. I don't know what to say. 

Edit: Thank you everybody.

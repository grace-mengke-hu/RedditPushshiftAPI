It is easy to say you want to quit, now its time to follow through

Today is the day I am now a non smoker. I know I need to do it for health reasons as well as killing a bad habbit. It will just be tough at work for the first few days. I work logistics and my boss smokes. It will take a lot to not cave in to cravings. I can do this and I know this great community can help me. Lets all do this together.

Edit: Start of work and a pallet got destroyed. May have lost my job and so I ran for the one thing I know. I caved in less then 4 hours. I need help.

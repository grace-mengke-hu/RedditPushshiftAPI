Hi guys, I haven't quite started to quit yet but...

What have been your tips/tricks to help you quit. I'm sure I was like all of you, I've tried to quit many times now and nothing seems to work. E-Cigs/nicorette, but I always keep coming back to my smokes especially when I drink. I just saw this sub in an askreddit post and quitting is something I'd really love to do... Anything will help, thanks!

edit: alright guys, after these last two in my pack, lets see how it goes!

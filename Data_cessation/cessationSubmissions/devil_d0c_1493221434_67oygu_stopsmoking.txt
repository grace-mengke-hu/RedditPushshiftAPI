I really miss my morning cigarette...

Edit: holy cow you guys... I did not expect the rush of support.  I should post here more often!  Thank you to all of you =)

I've been lurking here for a while, never posted though... I gave up smoking 2 days ago after failing last week, and the week before that.

Mornings are the hardest, i miss my normal routine of browsing reddit on my porch with a cig and my coffee.

I'm sure someone here had the same routine as I did, any tips on breaking that habit?  I hate that I miss it, I know I shouldn't miss something that really did nothing for me but slowly choke me to death, but here I am pining as if it were a lost lover.

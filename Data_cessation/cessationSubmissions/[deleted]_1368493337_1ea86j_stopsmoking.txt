After an awesome weekend in Key West, tomorrow I'm done smoking.

Had a blast this weekend. Drank a lot, smoked a lot, now I'm ready to quit. I was conscious of every cigarette and realized I didn't need them to make my time there more enjoyable. Tomorrow its back to reality, saying bye to nicotine for the last time. I know now that all smoking does is make me feel like crap, I'm ready to start living. Wish me luck, and any advice is much appreciated!

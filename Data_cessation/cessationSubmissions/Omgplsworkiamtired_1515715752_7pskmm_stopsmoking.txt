Quit in December having trouble

I am having trouble with getting past the idea of quitting being forever. I still feel like it's a bad thing like I am missing out. My brain has lost it. This is a stupid thought process. 

I have messed up and smoked twice now. 

The problem is I am the smoker that can go a week or more in between having one cigarette. I have quit before only to start the cycle of one here and there and it becomes a pack here and there and so on. 

I know I can maintain where I am at right now but I don't want to just stay here. I want to quit for good. 

I also have ADHD and take adderall. We upped the dose in December in preparation for this because (new to meds started October) it's a stimulant. I smoked to give my self purpose when I couldn't focus. 

I am going back to my medication timers because the afternoon dose keeps getting forgotten and maybe that will be enough to help get back on track.

It's more about the habit and "temporary feeling boost" I get from the cigarette. 

Tomorrow I am recommitting. 

I already went through an ear infection, respiratory infection, and laryngitis immediately after the first slip up. Like the next day I was in the doctors office getting a steroid shot because I couldn't breathe. You would think that was enough to not slip up again. But I did. 😡😐😕

Anyone using the SmokeFree app’s Quit Coach?

Interested in how you’ve found it. I’m halfway through Day 12 and I’d attribute this (my most successful attempt yet) partly due to the accountability and instant support of the Coach. 

It is getting a bit same-y though and the artificial intelligence doesn’t seem to be very, well, intelligent. 

I don’t work for the developers or anything. Just a curious user.

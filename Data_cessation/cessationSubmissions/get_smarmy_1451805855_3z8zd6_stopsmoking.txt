One Week + Why I Really Quit

I'm 31. Been smoking off and on since I was 19. At first one a day, and later up to as much as a pack. In later times about 6 cigs a day so nothing major. I have quit before for as much as two years, and sometimes for a couple of months, but I just could NOT quit this most recent time. For the longest time of trying and failing and trying and failing and and and.

I didn't post my first day "yay I am finally doing this" post even tho I wanted to bc the cycle of quit and fail is exhausting, and I really wanted to go a whole week before I told anyone.

I'm using patches right now, and it helps a lot. I only crave first thing in the morning and before bed. (New Years was hard bc I had some beers but I resisted.)

Anyway today was one week. I quit on the 27th. I don't want to go back, even if it's hard. I keep telling myself... If I can't quit for myself and my own health and happiness, I can and will quit for my kids, because they do NOT need to be motherless.

I am just so tired of being afraid of dying and leaving them,

So I feel good about this and I'm gonna keep going this time. I AM. :)

(Edit: OH! And also, I noticed today that the cough is almost completely GONE!!!!)

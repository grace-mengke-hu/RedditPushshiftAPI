I threw the pack in the bin, I've never done that...

So I've smoked for more than half my life, come form a family of smokers. Been around smoke all my life and now I just threw the box in the bin. Holy shit it feels weird, I hate wasting anything but I didn't care, the message alone of throwing them into the bin meant more to me. Its only been 4 hours and still no substitute or major craving. 

I can do this! I know I can, fuck nicotine!

Wednesday 21'st of February I smoked my last cig. Since then I haven't even picked one up to put it down.

I know it sounds easy and it's only almost five days, but this is the longest I've gone without cigs for three years. And I haven't even complained about my cravings or thought about buying a pack. I'm proud!

And sorry if the title has spelling mistakes or what ever, my point is to share how awesome I feel!

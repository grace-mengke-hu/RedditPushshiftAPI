Trying to quit, plus bipolar disorder ðŸ™„

Hey all! I must have quit and un-quit about a hundred times, so this time round I thought I'd try and check in here every now and again to see if it can keep me on track. 
The biggest issue for me is that my mental health is really shaky most of the time - I'm bipolar and my living situation isn't very good (had to move back into a house where some really bad things happened to me - it's fine now, but still has horrible associations which makes things a bit tough). Every time I've tried to quit this year it's thrown me into a horrible depressive episode, and no matter how much I tell myself I'm going to deal with it by exercising more and so on, I always end up going into a total spiral and doing things which are even worse for me than smoking is (and have ended up seriously hurting myself on a few occasions).
Anyway, try, try and try again. I think making myself post here now and again might help (and even if it doesn't, I don't think it can hurt?). Thanks for listening :)

Day 7 today

This was a hard week.  I've been smoking for 37 years.  The only other times I have tried were army and navy bootcamp and I quit from Feb 2013 through June 2015.  Im starting to feel physically better but I forgot how hard it was because I am struggling so bad.  I just keep on telling myself that I am a non smoker now.  As probably thousands have said before me, I don't want to pay to get sick and die but it is so friggin hard.

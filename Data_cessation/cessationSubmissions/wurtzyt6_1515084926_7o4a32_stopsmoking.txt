Quit for 10, fell off 1.5 yrs ago, back on!

Quit in Nov. 2006. in Feb 2016 I thought I could have a few on vacation (Cigars/couple smokes) - nope! was pretty good having one here and there for 6-8 months, then house/marriage issues and was full in again by the end of 2016. On and off smoking since then but it's 2018 - the kids are too old to BS and I'm too young to die from something like this! Let's go get them everybody!

Day One Motivation

So I started off writing this post out as the reasons I'm quitting but turned it into motivating things for myself by the end of it. If anyone wants to add theirs it'd be nice to see why you guys did it too.

Weirdly, in my haze of not going for a smoke at the time I usually do, I kept switching between 1st and 3rd person.

Just needed somewhere to store it, then I can keep going back to it.

- My friends don't even smoke - I'm about the only one who does so So when I'm with my friends or flatmates I have to leave their company to go for a smoke. Why are you leaving your friends every 30-60 mins? That's a really odd thing to do. 

- I hate pausing a movie 1 hour in and walking away for 5 minutes to smoke. Just stop smoking and watch the whole goddam movie.

- I hate the smell of other smokers when they sit next to me on the bus/tube etc. That's what I smell like to everyone else. It's pretty damn awful.

- Give your teeth a goddam chance to enjoy themselves - stop giving them weird little stains - your teeth look like a rainbow viewed through a yellowish filter.

- You're spending over Â£3500/year. Man that's stupid. In 3 years without smoking and without spending anymore money, you could clear all of your debts that you're worried about.

- Don't use your girlfriend as an excuse - she smokes like 1 or 2 cigarettes a day at most. You're the reason she smokes any more than that.

- That tight feeling you get in your chest when you play football isn't because you ran so much in the first ten minutes - it's because your lungs are pissed at you for ruining them for the past 5 years. Stop, let your lungs have fun.

- You don't like anyone telling you what to do - even your manager has worked out different ways of getting you to do things. Why do you let a little voice in the back of your head decide what you should do? Tell the little voice to relax - you'll get to him later. Tip: Never get back to him.

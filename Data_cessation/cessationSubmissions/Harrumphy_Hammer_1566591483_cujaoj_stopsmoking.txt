Almost a year and feeling really bad.

Hi, I was a 20 year smoker and a 5 year addict of nicotine gum until October 9th of last year.  I had suffered anxiety and depression as a teen and I think I started using nicotine to self medicate.  So far it's been a really rough quit; I gained 30 pounds, 20 of which I've lost by running 30 miles a week this summer, but the depression and anxiety just will not stop.  I'm sitting in my office counting down the minutes until I can leave so I can just sit in my car and cry.  I know quitting was the right decision, but I really don't want to have to take anxiety meds or antidepressants and be a zombie.  Does anyone have any tips, maybe diet or vitamins?   I obviously can't do any more physical activities than I'm doing right now.  Idk, someone tell me this will eventually get better.

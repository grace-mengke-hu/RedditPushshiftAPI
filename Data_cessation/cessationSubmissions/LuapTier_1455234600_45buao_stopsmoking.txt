I relapsed today. Absolutely disgusting.

So tonight I had a bad craving. So I went to the shops and bought 10 cigarettes. I smoked 2 of them and broke the rest up. The taste and smell was awful, this showed me how much smoking dampened my taste and smell before.

The reason why I gave in was this: I kept telling myself that everyone that quits smoking *needs* to know what it's like to relapse. 

I am absolutely disgusted in myself, I have let myself down and my family (although they don't know about it).

One thing is certain. I will not relapse again. While I was smoking those 2 cigarettes I noted down everything about it, what it felt, tasted and smelled like. Sickening. I will now look back on the note I took If I ever feel like smoking again.

I'm not sure If I should reset my badge or not, I need your help. I'm sure I  will feel guilty for having those extra 10 days in a few months. So should I just reset it?

Weight gain woes

Been smoke free a year and a few months after 13 years of 15-20 a day. Still at the point where when I would usually smoke (after food, boredom, driving between jobs etc) I'm finding myself needing something to replace the habit of lighting up. At the moment I'm literally just eating.

Any good suggestions to beat the new sugar and junk food addictions I've gained in lieu of the nicotine? 

Gained 2 stone after losing 4 stone and feeling great before quitting so feel like crap.

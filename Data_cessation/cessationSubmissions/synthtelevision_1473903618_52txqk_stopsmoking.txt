Practically all my friends smoke. It's so hard to quit.

95% of my friends smoke. We're all around 18 or 19, and all live in Berlin. Might as well be called the city of smokers, pretty much all the young people smoke. I have been smoking for a couple of months now, and in comparison to my friends, I started very late. They had already started with 13 or 14. I don't know why I could resist the urge for so long, but a couple of months ago I started to smoke more and more, until now I'm smoking just as much as they are. 

Every time we're going out somewhere in the evenings, my friends start smoking, and I get this unbelievable urge to smoke with them. This is very new to me, as while I've already had cigarettes with 16 or 17, I never had the urge to do it daily. Never a feeling of addiction.

Is there a biological reason for me now becoming addicted in my late teens, and what things can I do while in the vicinity of my friends to keep me from smoking? The hardest is always when I get offered a free cigarette from a friend, declining there is always the hardest.

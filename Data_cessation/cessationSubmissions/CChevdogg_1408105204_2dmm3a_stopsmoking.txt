7 days in and he pulls this shit..

So I've been clean since Friday, but it has been very challenging and my friend makes it much more difficult.

I go to the gym with my friend daily because I've been teaching him to lift. We always usually would light up a smoke after the gym because that's when the headbuzz hits you the most, but last week I quit. This week I've still let him smoke in my car to test my limits and I've been successfull, but yesterday, I told him I was having serious cravings and not to smoke it my car. What does he do? Disrespect my request and immediately light one up. So I told him to put it out and he said "nahhhh man just be strong". Now, he's my friend so I didn't want to make a huge deal of it, so I threw his full pack of cigs out the window and Started to drive away. He started freaking out saying he's broke blah blah so I quickly rip a U turn and go back to get them. 

I told him next time he smokes in my car, I'm running them over. Hope he got the point.

COLD TURKEY OR NICOTINE PATCH

Wondering what worked for you quitters out there? I have smoked for 20 years (omg how did it get to be that long!!!) I have tried quitting a handful of times over the years. Never cold turkey. I tried Chantix and went crazy, so stopped that. This just needs to be it for me. I am 35 years old going to bed with sore throat, chest pain. I am embarrassed that i have smoked this long. Any advice is appreciated!!

need help finding the right method for me! do not want to replace with another drug or unhealthy habit, and my main concern is what nicotine is doing to my body and brain in the immediate sense. very very addicted, smoking for half my life.

hey guys - desperately want to quit smoking and honestly don’t even like or enjoy it anymore. but i am recently sober, and i’m worried about what adding yet another withdrawal to the picture will do to me and to my life. the constant nicotine intake is killing my appetite and keeping me awake so much i can hardly sleep or eat at all so i think it’s pretty urgent. it’s really taking a toll on my health. i’m trying to find a method for weaning myself off nicotine that someone with a highly addictive personality can actually stick to. and i really don’t want to add any other substances to the picture if i can help it, because i’m trying to learn how to cope with my stress and emotions without substances (including prescribed/legal/over the counter ones). 

are there any methods that fit what i’m looking for? i’ve been looking into weaning, and slowly replacing the habit with things like exercise and meditation. in the past i’ve done cold turkey and had success but i don’t think it would be safe for me to do that right now. 

thanks in advance!

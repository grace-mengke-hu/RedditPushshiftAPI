Want to share something I don't read often.

What helped me quit was black coffee and altoids. For some reason the combo made my mouth and taste buds so numb and the coffee acted as a stimulant that it helped me substitute the effect of nicotine. I know this makes absolutely no sense but it worked wonders for me. whenever I would crave a smoke, i'd pop two wintergreen flavored altoids. 

Quit 08/31 last year and have been on track ever since.

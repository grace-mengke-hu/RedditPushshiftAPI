Another milestone passed!

I don't come here often any more, but I clicked on one post and noticed that my badge hit 4 figures last week! That's a great feeling!

I can't recall the last time I felt a craving. They do come up from time to time (so many films have so many cigarettes in them!) but they're slight and fleeting these days.

My quitting notes are still online here: http://tobold.org/entry/2012-05-19

It's my /r/stopsmoking cake day!

Boy, a year sure does go by fast! After 13 years of smoking, and multiple quit attempts using every method short of hypnosis and acupuncture, I thought I'd surely be smoking my way to the grave. I had seen so many smokers die in one way or another, though, and deep down I really didn't want to end up like they did. 

 I had tried quitting so many times without success that I had pretty much resigned myself to failure. On that third day last year, that was the biggest struggle of quitting  throughout the whole year by far.

 The junkie inside of me was really wanting me to give in and give up on myself again. That evil fucking bastard. The Junkie, he's a tricky little asshole. He'll use any method he can think of to get you back in the game. He'll tell you that you just need to cut down to ween yourself off. That you can't just quit cold turkey because it's too difficult. He'll make you reminisce about it, make you think that you're missing out on something. He'll tell you that bumming one cigarette here or there when you're having a drink at the bar is no big deal. Well that third day is really the ultimate battle for most people - you just might not know it - after that day you're basically just finishing off wrestling that weak junkie  fuck to the ground. 

In the end I quit cold turkey, and it was ultimately so easy that it almost doesn't feel like such a big deal. It is though, and I'm so proud of myself for getting over that hump. To all the new quitters out there, you can do this! Check back here whenever you feel weak. Give a newbie advice - it'll make you feel more accountable. And get your badge or an app on your phone - it'll motivate you to keep not smoking. To all of you that have made it a year or more - we fucking did it! You guys are awesome :)

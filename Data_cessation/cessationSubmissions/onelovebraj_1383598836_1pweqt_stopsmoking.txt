Do any of you dream about smoking?

I'm almost 6 weeks nicotine free, and for some reason I have had 3 or 4 dreams in which I smoke a cigarette. Every time I smoke in a dream, I immediately become upset in the dream and yell at myself for breaking my quit. When I wake up, I am almost in tears until I realize that it was only a dream, and I have not smoked since quitting. Does anyone else experience this? I'm not sure what to think about these dreams.

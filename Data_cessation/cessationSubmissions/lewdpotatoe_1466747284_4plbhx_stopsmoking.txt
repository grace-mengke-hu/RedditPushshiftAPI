Just hit two weeks smoke free and my first running milestone

Hello everyone, I have been browsing this forum for almost three years now, but have never posted or even owned an account.


Two weeks ago I run out of cigarettes and thought it was as good a time as any to quit. To preface this; I have tried to quit about 50 times before, always at the end of a pack and have always failed before day three.


What was different about this time, is that I started running to deal with the cravings. I found that if I ran late morning I wouldn't get any cravings until the evening.


The first day I run (the day after I quit), I ran 2km at a 7min/KM pace. At the end of the run I had to lay down because I was so worn out.
Today (exactly 2 weeks) I ran 4KM at a 6.11min/KM pace and finished feeling like I could almost do another kilometre! For anyone who seriously runs you will know this isn't very impressive at all, but considering I couldn't even run 1km about a month ago I'm very happy.


I wanted to share this for two reasons: 
1. I'm really proud and honestly wanted to boast a little lol. 
2. Running really helped me get this far, I think quiting by running is a very legitimate strategy that people should explore.


Don't know if I have quit smoking forever, but I have never made this far before!


Next goal is to make it to a month

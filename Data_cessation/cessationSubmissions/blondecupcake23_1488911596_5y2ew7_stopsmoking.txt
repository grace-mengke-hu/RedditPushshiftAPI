I am going to smoke today

I can't take it anymore. It's day 8 I am so angry and frustrated for no good reason- I'm stressed out at work got a big presentation on Thursday first of its kind- I can't sleep- boyfriend kept me up all night with his tossing and turning and horrendous snoring. I'm at work not just livid on the inside because I hate this- hate feeling like I am missing something- just want to calm down with a cigarette- because otherwise I may honestly just loose my shit with my boyfriend tonight and pick a huge fight and take even more of this out on him than necessary. I just hate this feeling- like I am not normal not even and just want to smoke. And I hate boyfriend today for introducing and forcing this concept onto me and hounding me shaming me to quit. I feel so pathetic if i give up but I don't want to keep going. I know I faught hard to be here on day 7 and some hours but I just don't know if this is worth it.

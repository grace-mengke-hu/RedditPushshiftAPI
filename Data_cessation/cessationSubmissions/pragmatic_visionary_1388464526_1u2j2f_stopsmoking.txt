Has anyone else had problems with metabolism after quitting?

It's been a few months since I quit and I can already see the extra inches around my mid section. I've always been a pretty slim guy. 5'7", 160lbs.watched what I eat. But now it's definitely obvious that my metabolism has almost came to a halt. Obviously the right answer here is to run more and hit the gym harder. I'm just curious if anyone else in this community is having the same problem and what you do to fix it.

My "non smoking" story of the day.  

I take the train to work every day.  10 minute train ride in the San Francisco bay area, no big deal.  I get on, I get off and I'm home.  Big woop.  

Today was different.  Today I get on, sit down and there's a guy sitting across from me.  He's minding his own business.  Out of nowhere the dude spits a loogie on the window.  My blood boils.  Nobody else says anything, and I snap.  He needs to be called out on his behavior.  So I do.  He argues with me for a bit even though he knows he's wrong.... fine.  Then he says to me with a straight face and filled with anger, "I just quit smoking.  You don't understand what my body is going through."  My eyes lit up.  Oh fuck yes!

Yes.  Yes I do.  I'm 17 days without a smoke and I'm not spitting on public transportation.  You're just a dick.  And casually walked off the train.

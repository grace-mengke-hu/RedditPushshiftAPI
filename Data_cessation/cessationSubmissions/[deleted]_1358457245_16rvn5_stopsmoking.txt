Reverting back to a Condescending Fetus (Day 1)

Heh, just a little joke me and my friend kinda made when we both decided to quit smoking. Me and him always talked about it but never really begun.

Right now, he is on the Chantix and I am going cold turkey. He has already a week of Chantix on me so we would both quit at the same time. In the meanwhile I have been testing out the waters of being an non-smoker. I only lasted 2 days a few days ago. 

I noticed an increase of anxiety when started smoking again. There goes my reason, I found it! A noticeable reason to quit along with the fact that smoking really hasn't been giving me any good feeling lately. 

After I broke the pack a day line, the rush and fun was gone. I smoked on average 13 cigs a day and lately in the past month, I couldn't remember one time where I felt good about it. Thus another reason for me to quit.


So here I am, day one of quitting. I haven't had a cig since yesterday night and man, waking up in the morning kinda sucked, but I move on. The last time I quit for 3 months was quite a chore. Here is what I remember though:

-Exercise for at least 20 minutes of cardio (it helps with the cravings so much)

-Twirling a pen around my fingers during the cravings or learning out to flip a coin on my knuckles (results may vary)

-Avoid Drinking/friends that smoke/really bad triggers that caused you to smoke in the past. Just for the first week, then gradually go back to them.

-Avoid talking/listening about it. Just put cigs out of your mind.

-After you are done with 3 months, do go back to tobacco.... ever! Damn cloves &%&^^$

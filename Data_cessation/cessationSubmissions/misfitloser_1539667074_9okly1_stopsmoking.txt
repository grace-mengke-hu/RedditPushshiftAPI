Procrastinating

The last time I quit was 15 years ago this month. Still haven't gotten around to starting again (not even a little bit--just this once for old times sake because i am under stress yada yada yada...) . I guess I am just too lazy to light up. 

Smoke doesn't bother me, bars  don't make me jones, I see people smoking, and sometimes I think, "Wow, I remember when I used to do that too..." I smoked for 30 years or so, from 15 to 45, and I started again about a thousand times. That's what I really quit doing: starting again.

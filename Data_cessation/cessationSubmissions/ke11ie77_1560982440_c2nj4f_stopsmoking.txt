Justifying smoking

I decided to tell my partner I would smoke on a Saturday with a drink 🙈 that way I would look forward to Saturday’s (I hate Saturdays) I work Saturdays, I love my job but just don’t like after work on a Saturday 😂.  I think it’s boredom, he enjoys red wine and weed so I’d join in with white wine and cigarettes.  I was in fact getting very bored of that life and wanted more excitement in life as that is not exciting to me.  So my junkie mind is now telling me “oh yes I have a great idea that will make you look forward to Saturday’s, smoke on a Saturday with a wine and join in” 
I mean seriously wtf, I read “junkie mind” recently and that is exactly what the thoughts are.  My boyfriend thinks it’s acceptable to smoke just with a drink on the weekend also 🤔😥

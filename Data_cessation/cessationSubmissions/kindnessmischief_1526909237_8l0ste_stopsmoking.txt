Thanks for making a safe place for my quit, r/stopsmoking

I was a secret smoker. Not one colleague or friend in the city I’ve lived the last four years knows I smoked. My mom lives with me and witnessed the evening ritual of hanging in the backyard cranking butts; she and one old friend are the only people I’ve told about my quit. EXCEPT FOR YOU! 

You guys! Thanks so much for making this space real, awesome, safe, and supportive. Every day I’m lurking and/or commenting and it feels GREAT. This is a good group and it’s making all the difference! Here’s hoping I can be a positive part of someone else’s quit the same way y’all are helping me. Cheers to another beautiful smoke free day, y’all!

Dealing with brain fog and a little inflammation?

I vaped the equivalent of about a pack and a half a day. I'm 28 hours into this, have no desire whatsoever to vape/smoke, and if I could get this damn brain fog and inflammation/water retention from my hands to go away, I'd be absolutely fine. Any way to speed this up? Sauna? Cardio? Maybe some liver support vitamins?

Cravings back after a month..

So I've been doing really well with pretty weak cravings, but I'm coming up on a month on 11/1 and my cravings have returned super strong today. I haven't deviated from my normal routine, so I'm not really sure why. I kinda thought I was past that stage but it doesn't seem that way now. Has this happened to anyone else?

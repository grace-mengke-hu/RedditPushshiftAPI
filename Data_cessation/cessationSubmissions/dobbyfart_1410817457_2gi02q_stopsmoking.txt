A very cool thing

So I've never been a runner and, let's be honest, probably never will be. It's just not my bag, baby. But I do love being active and my biggest love is being outdoors. Walking, hiking, climbing, swimming, lying down on the grass and reading....doesn't matter, love it all equally. 

I smoked for about six years, sometimes as little as a cigarette a day, sometimes as much as a pack and a half, it really just depended on my living situation and whether it lent itself to smoking. In all that time I always walked and hiked but I also had a cigarette or a pack nearby. It was one of the things I liked the most about being outside was how easy it was to light up. When the weather cleared enough for me to get outside again I felt a slight pang at how I missed smoking. What does one do with oneself on a walk without a cigarette?

That passed quickly, thank goodness. I kept walking, kept hiking, blah blah blah. Then the other day I was out and I really wanted to push myself. I didn't have my daughter with me, who is always in my backpack when I go out, and I was by myself instead of with my hiking partner like I normally am, so I could set the pace. Out of nowhere I thought, You know what would be fun? Running. So I did. I ran as far as I could, which wasn't far, but I still ran. And I thought, when was the last time I ran like that? Years ago, was the answer but I didn't put it together until I came to this sub today that the answer was really, "Years ago, before I started smoking." 

I don't know if I'll start running or not, but I'm finally to the point where it would be an option!

**tl;dr I can breathe, y'all!**

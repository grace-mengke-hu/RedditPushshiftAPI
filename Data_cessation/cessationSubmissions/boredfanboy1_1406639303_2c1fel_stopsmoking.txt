A New Day 1

It's Day 1 again.  I've been smoking a pack a day about 12 years now.  I've tried all the nicotine replacements, read Allen Carr four times and listened to him once.  None of those stuck.  My plan is to quit as many times as it takes to stick.  I haven't tried to quit in a while, so I grabbed a pack of American Spirits, smoked them down, and said "that's it."  I'm not telling my friends or family, because I'm tired of telling them I'm quitting and failing.  I guess I'll tell you guys, since you have heard it plenty of times from yourselves and others.  Wish me luck.

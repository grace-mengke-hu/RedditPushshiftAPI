Pregnant and struggling

Hi guys,

I've had to create a new account, as I am quite sure that a few people know my regular account name and as my partner and I haven't told people that we're expecting yet, I'd like that people don't find out through reddit. 

Anyway, my problem is that I am smoking and expecting! I have smoked for 14 years, and for the last 8 years I've smoked about 15 a day. 
We found out 4 days ago that we're expecting and obviously it's been our top priority to stop smoking since (partner smokes as well). 
However, I am finding it really freaking hard!

My mind is already all over the place due to the pregnancy and normally I would deal with a new situation with smoking. 
So far, I've cut my usage down to half but I am really struggling. 

I've looked into Hypnotherapy and I know a few of my siblings have been successful with Laser therapy (acupuncture), but it doesn't seem to be a thing where I live. 

I know about Allen Carr and I have the audiobook, although I haven't given it much of a chance. 

Anyway, I am really just looking for any kind of advice as I just want to quit smoking and stop this constant shame of craving cigarettes at a time where I should focus on providing the best environment for small things to grow.

If it's relevant in any way; I am only 4-5 weeks.

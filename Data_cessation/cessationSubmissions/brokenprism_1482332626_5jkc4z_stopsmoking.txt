540 days smoke free, on today, my 6 year reddit cake day.

Hey there nice community. I wanted to milk a little karma for my **Cake Day** and i figured, why not also talk about my path to being a quitter.

Well, if you've seen my posts before you'll likely remember that I made the choice to quit while standing at my paternal grandparents 60th wedding anniversary. 

I noticed in this swath of family that my uncles and aunts that smoked, where ostracized, biker, dive bar people. and  my aunts and uncles that didn't smoke where very successful, well rooted in the community type people.

Aside from that Darwin's logic I was also considering that having just been married in April that year, standing at a 60th anniversary in June was an eye opener that if i don't stop smoking I may never see a 60th with my amazing wife.

I have since not smoked through a whole lotta bullshit. i.e. being stranded at Denver international airport over night. having a rock shatter a rental car window on the New Jersey Turnpike on my way to meet a client. All of Michigan. etc...

until this last weekend. playing d&d with my long time friends and younger brother... the kids i've known 15+ years aka over half my life. They all smoke... 

Well, with the holiday stress, the signing up for college to finish my degree online, property tax increases, credit card bills coming due, wife wanting to quit her job because its draining the life out of her, and both of our parents pestering us about getting them some grandchildren. I snapped, went to the c-store during a snack run break of the 9 hour d&d session and bought a pack of Marlboro Edge cigarettes.

**On 12/17/16 I smoked 5 cigarettes.** My d&d friends gave me grief the entire time, my brother looked devastated. but I felt great. I missed everything about smoking.... Well... except the smell, and the taste, and the lingering "this person smokes" smell. 

I woke up on Sunday, throat closed, pounding headache, and I couldn't get the smell out of my nose. My very supportive wife told me that I have to make the choice for myself that she wont tell me I cant smoke or it'll drive me to smoke. But I knew right then that i'll never smoke again. 

I soaked the pack in the sink and threw them away.

I apologize for the speed bump, but i am not resetting my badge. I feel like that would be too much of a blow to my psyche. I argue that if I think of myself as a 1.5 year none smoker moving forward, I am less likely to put myself through this awful awful weekend again.

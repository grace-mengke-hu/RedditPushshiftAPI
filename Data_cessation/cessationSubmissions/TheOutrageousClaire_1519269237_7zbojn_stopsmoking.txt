it's been three months and i don't feel crazy anymore

I just wanted to say that I don't feel crazy anymore. I felt really crazy for a while there. I was struggling with emotional regulation without being able to turn to cigarettes anymore. I just want you all to know that this gets better. It gets easier. I posted a few times complaining early on in this journey, so I thought I should come back and say something a bit more hopeful now that I'm feeling less horrible. I don't feel a hundred percent normal yet but I'm close. Everyday is better than the last one. Thank you to this  for being there for me during the hardest moments. This gets easier. I promise this gets easier.

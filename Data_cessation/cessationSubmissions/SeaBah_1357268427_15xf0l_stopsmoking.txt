I feel like I've passed all the tests

I quit with two half packs, one that is still in my car and the other in my room.  I've been drunk (just buzzed) and belligerent (new years) already.  Did a little 420 and taken my break at work and even sat at the smokers bench.  Endured the rain and avoided smoking after a horrible game of Dota2. 

All of these situations that I would normally want to smoke, without smoking cold turkey.

I barely crave cigarettes anymore and I'm more determined then ever to quit.  I feel like there is no turning back and I'm feeling great about this.  This forum has been so much help thank you to everyone so far.

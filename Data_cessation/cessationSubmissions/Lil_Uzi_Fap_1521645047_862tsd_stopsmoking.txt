My mama didn't raise no fool.

So i quit smoking yesterday, and as usual i couldn't resist the urge today so i bought a pack and smoked like 3 cigarettes before i threw the pack and the lighter away, i almost cried in the street today because i really have to quit, i'm wasting my money and my health.

It has happened a lot before that i wait to finish my cigarette in front of the pharmacy so i can get in to buy my asthma medication, which is pathetic and so foolish.

I don't wanna do that again, i'm so tired of smoking, i've been lurking this subreddit for a year now but i never posted here because this place is my real discomfort zone, i'm really hoping that this time would be different, i'm gonna try Allen Carr's easy way, and i feel i can do it this time, because i've hit rock bottom, wish me luck guys.

Day 5. The world ain't so bad.

I've made daily posts here and it's helping me. I've made it to day 5. I'll tell you what, I'm to the point the life of a non smoker is great. The world looks more colorful. Food, my god, food taste great. I'm looking better. Don't get me wrong i get around 10 cravings a day and really want to smoke, I don't though. Thanks for the support. Lets keep this good thing going.

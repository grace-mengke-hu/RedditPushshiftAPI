Day 30...

And I’m still winning. I don’t actually miss  it really post day 4. Maybe every other day I might get a mild craving which goes quickly. I’ve even been out partying and this is cold turkey after 20 years of smoking 10-20 a day. I have been miserable sod though apparently but that’s passed.

Thus far I am lucky and it’s probably just complacency that is my enemy now.

Feel for those who have a much worse time. Good luck!

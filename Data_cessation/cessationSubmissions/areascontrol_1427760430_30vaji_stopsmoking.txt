Today I don't want to smoke but I sure would like to not feel how I feel. Suggestions/ halps?

I think only internet peoples will understand this situation.  I found out today that my online friend of ten years passed away suddenly- massive heart attack at 53 years old.  She left behind her husband and three teen children.  (And no, she was not a smoker.)  

We spoke via messenger weekly at minimum and sometimes as often as daily.  She was a teacher and mentor and great friend to me.  I am gutted and well shit, I just don't like how bad this feels!  I know from a recent relapse that I used cigarettes to take the edge off my emotions, especially intense ones, whether positive or negative.  I would like to be brave enough and strong enough to face them and move through them head on.  I have not smoked today and will not.  That's all, I guess.

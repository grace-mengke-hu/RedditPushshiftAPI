a student who needs community motivation to continue abstinence

Hello all,

Been smoking since 16, habit became regular since I entered university three years ago (pack a day at most). April 2018, I quit smoking cold turkey and I haven't had a cigarette since (No patches, no gum). I would get mild cravings throughout my abstinence but its not been that severe that it would affect my daily routine of school, studying, social. Recently because of summer school and exams are coming up, I've been overindulging in food which affected my body to balloon up 10 pounds. I read about nicotine gum (2mg) and so I've been taking it since about two weeks ago to help my food cravings, which has been greatly beneficial.

The problem now is that I have two finals next week and now all I want is a proper smoke and I'm willing to throw away nearly 4 months of a healthy body. Eastern time here, dead midnight and I'm looking at y'all to really help convince me otherwise not to go downstairs and buy a pack.

TY.

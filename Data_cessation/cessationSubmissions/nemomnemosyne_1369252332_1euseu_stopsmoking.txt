Starting tomorrow.

Tried to start today, but had one a few minutes ago. Tomorrow I'm going to start anew because I'll be out of my current pack and will not buy a new one. I'm using the Android CessationNation app to try and keep track of my health/money/time saved from not smoking. 

The last time I genuinely attempted to stop I made it 1 1/2 months, but then I got drunk one night and fell back into the habit. I noticed that after about 2 weeks it becomes a lot easier, but that was over a year ago and I feel far more addicted than before (I have only smoked for 2 years). 

What's some decent strategies to distract yourself from thinking about a cigarette? Before caving earlier it was literally the only thing I could think about and frustrated me so much I had to cave (or felt like I had to).

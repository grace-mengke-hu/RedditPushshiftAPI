21 Days and My First Smoking Dream

Yay! Three weeks today! I am so stoked! Never thought I'd make it this far. 

Had my first smoking dream last night. Dreamed I had a cigarette and had to reset my counter. I was really sad. So, thank you and bless the person who made the counter. It's sure helping me quit. As is the rest of this sub. You guys are awesome. 

Let's all not smoke together today to celebrate my third week!

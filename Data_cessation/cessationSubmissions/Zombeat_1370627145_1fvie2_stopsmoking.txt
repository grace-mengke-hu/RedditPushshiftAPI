Day 3: just take a deep breath and chill......

After more than a decade smoking, I have been cigarette free for 3 days, I feel great, I smell great, and I STILL WANT A CIGARETTE!  Breathe in, Breathe out.....I can do this.....I am in control.

I want to thank you /r/stopsmoking for keeping me motivated!

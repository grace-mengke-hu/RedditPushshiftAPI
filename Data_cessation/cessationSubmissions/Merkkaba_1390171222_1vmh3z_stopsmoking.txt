Day 13, no nicotine.

I quit at the beginning of the class term Jan 6).  No patch, no gum, no e-cig.  I do smoke cannabis a few times a day, but I did that when I smoked as well.  I don't have any advice for people wanting to quit, I have been thinking about it for a while and just stopped. 

Also, my new gym membership costs about $28 a month, that is 3 packs of smokes which I would consume in two nights of drinking.  You can quit anytime you want, you just have to want to quit.

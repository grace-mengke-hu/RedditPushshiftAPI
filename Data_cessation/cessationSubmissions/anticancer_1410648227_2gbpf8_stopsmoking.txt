72 hours in… Feeling pretty weird!

After the first 24 hours, I feel like three days is the next big milestone.  I made it!

  I read on whyquit.com that the three day mark is when the withdrawals peak as the nicotine leaves the body.  It is difficult to describe how I feel physically/mentally, but it is a trip.  I am trying to relish the sensation (although it is a miserable one) and keep telling myself it is 17 years of poison leaving my body…

  I know that many people say not to avoid being around smokers or trigger situations but I am only three days in and I am afraid I will cave if I go out, so I have sequestered myself in the house for the weekend.  I don't want to take the chance that I will get drunk and fall off the wagon, which I see as a high probability given that many of my friends are drinkers and smokers.

  However, I did make an excursion this morning: I rode my bicycle to the farmers market and had a really lovely moment – I walked by the flower stall and paused because I could actually *smell the flowers*…  It almost made me want to weep.

  Thank you all for the solidarity.  I am certain that I wouldn’t have made it even through the first day without each of you here.

Quitting buddy

4 years passed since I was a smoker, 3 of which were a steady pack-a-day smoking. So many things changed in these 4 years- college graduation, new cities to live in and my first dark dark depression periods. After investigating depression and not finding any reasons of its cause, I figured that maybe its cause is something that is much simpler than I thought- nicotine addiction and losing a sense of control. So many attempts to quit and I never even lasted a single day without cigs. 

I want to start my journey. Is anyone willing to join me one of these days? I know that the first three days will be extremely difficult and we could really use each other's support. Please PM or reply to me.

Best regards.

Today is the day!

I have been smoking for a long time, not a heavy smoker but still a smoker. Now I have decided once and for all that it is time to quit. I want to take care of myself and live healthier and happier. I know it will be really hard and that I most likely will have times I regret it, but I also know that this is the best for me in the long run. 

What I don't know is what to do when I want to smoke or how to get my mind off of it. Any tips or tricks?

Why is it so damn hard?

So... I have tried every which way to quit, I can never seem to do it, I fail so quickly. I have not gone 24 Hours without a cigarette for 2 years now, that scares me, I am scared because I have a habit that controls me and I feel nervous and then I smoke. I have tried nicotine replacements...didn't feel the same so I smoked again. I have read Alan Carr... but I'm too cynical to really get on board with it, I can see through what the text is. Sorry for the rant, it feels good to just write down and hopefully someone will read. I'm  new here...any tips for stopping once and for all? I have set my quit date for Wednesday and am going to give it a go for the first time in 2 years. Thanks for reading!

We're slaves to habit, so I have to reset.

Well I lasted two weeks, lol. The truth is I realize what a mindless habit smoking is. I really don't recall even buying that last pack of cigarettes. I mean I KNOW I stopped at the gas station to get gas but out of habit, I remember just purchasing the pack then the next morning thinking, "Why did I do that? I'm supposed to be quitting!" The next thing I knew, I received some bad news then I was on my porch sparking one up. One pack later and I felt SO GUILTY!

It's like we're slaves to habit or something. Two weeks was the longest I had went in forever and now that's gone until another 2 weeks. Need to try to find a better way to deal and something to replace this nasty habit with.

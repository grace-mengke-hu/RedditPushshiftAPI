Day 1: I don't want to kill anyone yet.

Woah. I'm actually doing it. For real this time. I'm using the second step nic patch and taking small puffs of my vape pen with a low mg for the times when I crave the physical addiction. I truly dgaf that people have some sort of weird angst toward nicotine replacement. I don't want to smoke cigarettes anymore. I hate smelling it, tasting it, the pain and yellowing in my teeth, being out of breath, the pain in my chest, neurotically seeking out signs of aging and blaming them on my stupid habit/addiction, and the myriad of other side effects (be them physical or psychological). Eventually I will ween off of the nic replacement, but for now I'm just happy I've made it even just this far. The first day in 8 years when I didn't smoke even one cigarette. For now it's enough.



One strange symptom that I didn't expect is this nagging feeling of having forgotten a chore or something. And then I realize what that chore is and feel all the better that I'm going through with this.



This post was probably better suited as a journal entry - sorry for that. I guess I just wanted to whisper out into the world this pride I have for this big small change in my little life. Here's to growing up!

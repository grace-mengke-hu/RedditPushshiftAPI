Withdrawal Symptoms

So I have tried to quit multiple times and this is honestly one of the better times and I think a lot of it has to do with the fact I am taking Chantix. The dreams are very vivid, but have not been terrible. 

I have had two unexpected things happen this time and I am not sure of their severity. Yesterday I had an asthma attack. I used to have asthma as a kid and it caused me to have issues as an adult, but I never expected a full on asthma attack especially after I quit smoking. Then today I woke up with a fever. I have read of a couple people with fevers, but I do not know how common it is.

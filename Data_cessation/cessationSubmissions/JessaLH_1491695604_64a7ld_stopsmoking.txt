Loving these changes.

It's been about a week for me now and right now I'm having a cook out with my mother and her bf. I can smell the food so well and can't wait to taste it! I'm loving how much better I feel. I've switched to only water as well and have been walking everyday, usually with my mother which is very nice to have something to do together. 

I also notice I'm sleeping better and waking up easier. Cravings aren't so bad anymore. When they hit I just take a deep breath and browse this sub. Anyways just wanted to say how much quitting smoking has made me feel better and is changing my life and glad to see all of you doing well also!

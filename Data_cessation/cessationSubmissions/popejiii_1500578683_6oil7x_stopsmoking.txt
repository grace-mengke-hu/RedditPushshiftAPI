Three years....

Three years ago today I had my last smoke.  I honestly can't believe it.  Truth is, I still have dreams about smoking.  It scares the shit out of me every time because it feels I've relapsed, and it's always a nice sigh of relief knowing it was just a dream.

I often smoked a pack or more a day.  I don't miss it at all.  I promise, If I can do it, so can you.  If you need help or just someone to talk to,  feel free to drop a line here or PM me.

You can do it too, stay strong!

Contemplating quitting

I'm sure this post has been made a thousand times but I could use some encouragement. I live in PA and the taxes just went up making cigarettes hardly affordable. I've used patches before and they worked right up until I stopped using them. I'm 24 and a little overweight. Trying to better myself. I also consider myself an alcoholic which is something I'm trying to work on as well.

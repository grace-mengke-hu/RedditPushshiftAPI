my present :80 euro for laptop

tomorrow is my 3 months.. that means i save 120 euro. today i bought a laptop for 200 euro (secondhand but welltreated) . so i spent 80 euro for this laptop. i dont really know its good deal or bad deal.

here the specification
acer aspire 3830TG
processor intel core i5 2410M
graphic nvidia geforce GT 540M 2GB
RAM 8GB DDR3
and so on...

not bad for 80 euros right.. sorry its out of topic.

I just found out I'm pregnant, and I'm so happy I quit smoking before this happened!

I was a pack a day smoker for 8 years, and I started quite young. As I approached an age where I began to think about having children I decided that it was time to give up smoking. 168 days of no smoking and I find out I'm pregnant! I used to worry that I couldn't quit in time (it took over 20 attempts for me to actually quit permanently) but I did it! This feels better than any cigarette I've ever smoked. 

I can't share this with many people at the moment, so I thought, why not share it here on reddit. I hope this motivates someone who is in my earlier position, to quit smoking.

Has anyone here ever tried to quit by chain smoking an entire pack at once?

First of all let me say my badge is completely wrong. I haven't attempted to quit since early last year. I would change it but I'm on my phone right now. 

I'm just wondering if anyone has ever tried the old school "dad caught me smoking, made me smoke an entire pack" method. I realize for some heavy smokers here this may have been standard practice. Personally I know this would probably make me really sick.

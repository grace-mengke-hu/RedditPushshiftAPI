Cold turkey and some withdraws

Let's start out with I'm on day number 5 with quitting. The story goes that my boyfriend wanted me to stop smoking. He found 3 packs of cigs in my car when I said I stopped. Ended up putting one pack inside of the drink arm rest that's between the backseat of the vehicle to hide. I would have 2 or 3 cigs a day. 2 at work, and 1 after work. Showered when I got home and didnt smoke when I stayed home.  Cant remember how long I went like that tbh. I also been taking CBD capsules. It was last Sunday where my body started to have the worst withdraws. Chills, twitching, lack of sleep, sweating, one nightmare. I did the same thing though, had a cig before going into work and after work. Till my body said no more when I lit one up, broke it in half, and tossed that pack away. Could it be possible that CBD helped me along the way of quitting?

4 days down...

10 years at roughly 10-15 per day (more on weekends). Gave up for 6 months last year - cold turkey, then relapsed. Finally got the the point again I couldn't stand the wheezing whilst laying down. 4 days in my lungs feel rejuvenated, I know I'm only at the beginning (again) but so glad I made this choice. The cravings are tough, 5-8 per day, but that's just mind games. The "smoke free" app really helps getting over them.

My only issue is very very heavy night sweats, I wake up and the bed is soaked! I don't remember this before, but I feel like every night I'm having some sort of fever! Anyone else had this - any advice?

I'm not going to break either way, just want to make life a bit more comfortable!!

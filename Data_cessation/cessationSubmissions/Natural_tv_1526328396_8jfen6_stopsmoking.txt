Throat burning and brown flecks in phlegm

Hey all, I am just over two weeks without any form of smoking or vaping and it has been a bit of an unpredictable journey. 

First, a little bit of my history. 


*I'm 29 years old, started smoking when I was 17. About a a pack a day from 19-27 with some weed smoking along the way. 


*Started trying to vape to quit about a year and a half ago, also picked up smoking weed during that time, very light amounts, 4-5 hits from a one-hitter a day maximum. 


*Had issues with only vaping and on occasion I would buy small cigars and inhale them like cigs, last time i did this was on and off from last November-January.


At the beginning of April, I was vaping a lot, like changing the batteries that were supposed to last for 2-3 days every 4-6 hours, I was also smoking one-hitters of weed in the evenings. I started to notice that I had a small pink bump on the back of my throat, and it really scared the shit out of me, so I started vaping less, and smoking less weed, and 7 days later I had taken my last puff of weed. I ended up going to the doc to get the sore throat and lump checked out, they then sent me to an ENT who told me the lump was a benign thing and too small to even worry about removing, and he just told me to do a sinus rinse for a while about the other symptoms.

As of writing this I am not 17 since my last puff of a vape, and almost a month without smoking weed, and I am still dealing with some symptoms that have my health anxiety really flaring up. Basically, when I wake up I have some dark-yellow, or light brown-mucus, and when I work out or run or do a really good salt-water gargle I sometimes hack up clear phlegm with some brown specks in it. I also seem to have a burning sensation and hoarseness in my throat most of the time, although mild. 

Is all of this par for the course with someone like me? Is it just something I will have to deal with until my body continues to clean itself out? 

Thanks!

The quitters flu

Whenever I quit smoking, I get the quitters flu. I quit again 2.5 days ago, this time (again) hoping that I won't start again (made several other changes in my life to increase my chances). However, I don't want to have this terrible cough again... is there anything I can do to prevent it?

If there's not, it's ok. It' the price to be paid. But it's not comfortable at all. I have quit several times since januari and I have been coughing most of that time. Just not now, but like I mentioned I fear it will come back again.

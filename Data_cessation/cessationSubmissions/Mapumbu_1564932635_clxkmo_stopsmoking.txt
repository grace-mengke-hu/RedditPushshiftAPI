I've cracked it

I'm here camping under the stars with a smoker and DIDN'T SMOKE. I actually have no internet here so this is not a live post but I have just tackled my hardest test.

I'm on day 32 but it is easy quitting at home. You just avoid those trigger situations. But camping under the stars. In Africa as well. Not going to pass an opportunity like that. 

The guy I am with was a co-smoker. We'd climb some big mountains and hit some waterfalls always with ciggies in put mouths. Campfires and breakfast coffee with a fag. But I broke it. Today. Beers with my dude round the campfire and I DID NOT SMOKE. It was hard as well. We did a big climb today and I was looking at him smoke thinking: damn: just this one? But there is no such thing as one cigarette. One cigarette round the campfire under the stars means I am a smoker for life.

One of the things that helped me was saying to myself: just not this time. Not going to smoke this time. Hope that helps someone. You guys have helped me so much, you don't even know

5 days in and something inside my head just keeps saying "Just have one." and it won't stop.

I have been smoking for almost 2 and a half year now.. I was a light smoker 1 - 5 smokes per day at most.. and always in secret.

I travelled to my parents' house last week and didn't buy a pack, and was surprised that I made it for 3 days without smoking, I said to myself "well, maybe this is it.. just keep going." I left my parents' 2 days now and overcame my cravings for almost 2 days now..

I know it just starts with one, and that I will be hooked again, any advice from fellow non-smokers?

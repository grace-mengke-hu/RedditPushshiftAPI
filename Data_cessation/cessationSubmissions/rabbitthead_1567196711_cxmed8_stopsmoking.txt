Smoking and injuries

I made it 2 days and relapsed. The times I haven’t smoked in the past, I was running and going to the gym regularly. It makes not smoking and being healthy a lifestyle. But now I’m older, and I can’t last a few days without hurting an old injury. So what’s the point of quitting if I can’t be healthy anyways?  I injured myself, so basically was like what the hell, and I smoked.

So I set. New quit date for September 1st. I will injure myself again, I’m sure...been doing it for a year.  This time I can’t let it spiral into smoking again. I need to have other things I can focus on to give me a reason to quit. So going to try again.

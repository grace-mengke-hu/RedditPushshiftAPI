Getting Better

While i know it is still early in my quit I made it through my two biggest triggers.  I work Saturdays bartending in a small dive bar where you can smoke.  Generally on Saturdays it goes open the bar, serve a drink, smoke a cigarette and repeat until the end of the shift where I sit and drink all night long smoking more.  I was able to make it through both drinking and bartending and was surprised by the support of other smokers while telling them I quit.  Now I just need to keep the streak going.

Back to Day Zero.

I'll keep this short and sweet. 

In Afghanistan, deployed as an MP. 

Few days ago they found one of my High School JROTC Friends Jmaal Keyes dead. It was Murder.

And today I got this lovely message from my dad on Facebook:


"Have to pass on some bad news...Mom and I are heading up to TN, looks like Aunt Sarah only has hours left. She fought hard but soon she will be joining Ruben and her Mom and Dad."

My Aunt has been fighting cancer for awhile, but she isn't doing so hot. 

Fuck it all.

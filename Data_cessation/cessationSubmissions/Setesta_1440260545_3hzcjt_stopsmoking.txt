I'm an idiot

So i was cigarette free for 223 days. Was feeling good, then while at work i just got the urge and well, i gave in. I ended up smoking in secret from friends and family for about a month. 

Now here i am again, 7 days without a cigarette hoping this will be the last time i have to quit smoking.  Just felt like sharing my story with you guys, thanks for reading :/

Is it possible to quit without really wanting to?

So I just quit three days ago. I've been smoking about 13 years regularly and I love it. Never quit and never even considered it. Some things about it bother me, but mostly I enjoy it and feel fine (although admittedly I've never actually been a non-smoking adult).

The only reason I quit is because my girlfriend wore me down and I basically promised her I would if we moved in together. The cravings aren't too bad, but I feel so utterly depressed and just like I had to give something up that I didn't even want to give up in the first place. Plus I resent my girlfriend a tiny bit for making me do this. Mostly, though, I feel depressed, demotivated, and slightly grouchy.

So my question is - is this sustainable? Can I quit even though I don't really want to? Will I suddenly feel so healthy and energized in a few weeks that it will all seem worth it? Do I just have to wait it out and I'll feel better?

Thanks in advance for your input.

EDIT: Wow, I just want to thank everyone for answering my question and being so supportive. This is a really wonderful community!

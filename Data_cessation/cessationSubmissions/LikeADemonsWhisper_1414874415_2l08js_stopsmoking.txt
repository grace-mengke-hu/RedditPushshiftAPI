Developing a bad habit. Can I nip it in the bud?

I don't really consider myself a smoker but I am putting myself at dire risk. 

I think I am developing the smoking habit the same way a lot of people do: I smoke when I drink.

This has been a habit for the last few months. I probably smoke maybe one or two cigarettes every one or two weeks. My concern is that this habit will turn into a sober urge which I do not want to happen. The urge seems to get stronger every morning after, but passes the next day. I don't think I should be banking on a "non-addictive personality" because that is irresponsible and an excuse. 

Does anyone have any good tips to stop this behaviour? "Not drinking" is probably not going to happen. I like to have fun.

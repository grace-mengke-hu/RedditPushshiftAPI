I’m doing it this time

Smoker for 8 years now. I’ve tried many times to quit. My main issue is my triggers, drinking and OMW to work. I have a weird addiction to where I can go 2 or even 3 days without smoking and it won’t cross my mind. But the moment I have a few drinks I’ll crave one and buy a pack. Then during the week I always have a pack left over that I smile on the way to work. 

Anyway that’s my cycle, but I just broke it. 

I was on a walk with my dog and I realized smoking is killing me. Slowly but surely. We were on a bride and I threw my almost whole pack in the river. 

I just feel elated, like a weight is off my shoulders. Just wanted to post here to see if anyone had any advice on how to stay smoke free.. besides not drinking... sorry I love whiskey and wine

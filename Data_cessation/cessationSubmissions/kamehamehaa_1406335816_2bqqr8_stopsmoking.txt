How do I do it?

I need help. Every night, before I go to bed, I think about how terrible this habit has been for me, how many times I've tried to quit before and how many times I have failed. I feel like I do not trust myself anymore because of the number of times I have let myself down on the promise I made the night before. 

The first thing I think about in the morning is cigarettes, I look at myself in the mirror and I see dark circles at the age of 25, I start hating myself, and I feel like I need another smoke. 

I'm not sure what to do anymore. I have thrown away several packs midway with determination and confidence, only to find myself giving in to that urge the next day. 

I have given up all faith in my ability - I want to surrender to those of you that have had enough will power to do what I cannot by my own accord.

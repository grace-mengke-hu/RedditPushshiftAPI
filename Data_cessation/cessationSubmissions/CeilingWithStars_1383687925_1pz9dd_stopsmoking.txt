A Healthier Alternative

Just wanted to thank everyone on this subreddit. I quit smoking on October 14th, after many failed attempts. I don't know what made me change my mind. I think I wanted to quit limiting myself, start a new chapter, something like that. So, I chose to set a date and each day I told myself, I have no other option if this doesn't work. This was the most difficult choice of my life, but ultimately the healthiest. I still have days where I will ask my boyfriend if I can hold a cigarette, and I will just hang onto it and chuckle, because I now realize what a weak crutch it is. I don't need to smoke to have friends, to be apart of something, or any other reason I have tried to justify my habit with. My depression has worsened, but now I cope with it in much healthier ways, such as talking, exercising, diet and sleep. I now am reteaching myself how to take care of my body, how to deal with everyday emotions the right way. A healthier way. 


  Every day is a new step, a new chance, a fresh page. 

So, in short, you CAN do it!! Whoever you are, wherever you are, whatever you do. There is always another way. Good luck and wish me luck and patience on my journey!

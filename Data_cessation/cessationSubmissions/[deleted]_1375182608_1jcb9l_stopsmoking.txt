I kicked opiates and then alcohol, time for the cigs, this is harder for me because its so much less harmful "right now".

As of this morning I'm taking on my last major addiction. I can handle cravings and side affects, I'm just really worried about the social aspect as all of my friends smoke. My job won't make it any easier as I work alone at night, its really quite dull usually and cigs help break up the night into easier to handle chunks. So if anybody has an idea of something to do when I'm with friends or at work instead of smoking, that would be great.

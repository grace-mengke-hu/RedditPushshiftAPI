Does cold laser treatment work to quit smoking?

My cousin who went for laser treatment as a joke on 1st of April. He said he went with 3 friends and was planning to light one up when he comes out.

He hasn't smoked in a month, and nether 3 of his friends. He's the type of guy who thinks the world is bad and everyone is out to get our money any way possible.

Any experiences?

Im travelling soon and will be visiting him ans planning to try it. I'm a huge sceptic when it comes to any form of quick fixes, but I can't find anything online about it yet. Only info I find is "clinics" that perform these prosidures.

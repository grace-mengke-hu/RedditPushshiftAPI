Does vaping count?

I smoked cigarettes for almost 30 yrs, about 20 of which I rolled my own.  It was really having a negative impact on my health.  I decided to start vaping (yes, I know I'm still using nicotine) and went from about 30 rollies a day to the point where I'm vaping the equivalent of about 3 ultralights per day now.  

I feel a whole lot better, have more energy, can breathe again.  I tried practically every other quit smoking method, but the vape has worked better than anyting else.  Am to the point of vaping 0 nic, just too satisfy the hand to mouth psychological aspect.

Do I get credit for quitting?

I failed today as a mother

Not sure if I can post this here, but you guys have been such a great support these past three weeks that I feel comfortable doing this. 

I lost my temper three times this morning with my poor two year old. While my daughter was having a tantrum, I realized that I was as well. There were two occasions where I  was shaking with anger...over the stupidest shit! I've had a lot going on since I quit... financial hardships, anxiety attacks, problems with my in laws who also happen to be our daycare providers two days a week. 

I just feel like I failed myself and my daughter. I have not smoked today, so that's a plus. Hit my three week mark today! I'm going to just take today with much more caution and awareness.

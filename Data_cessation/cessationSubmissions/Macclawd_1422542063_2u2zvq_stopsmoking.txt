I don't even think in smoke again.

It's only 5 months ago? really? It feels like I've never smoked!

Seriously I don't think on it, I don't want to smoke at any time, doesn't matter if I'm drunk or not, if I'm sad or happy, stressed or relaxed, I just simply don't want to smoke.

I know every person it's different but I wrote this to tell loud and clear, the cravings will disappear, just keep strong.

How addictive is nicotine gum?

FYI I am not a heavy smoker, I started smoking at the beginning of this year while I was studying for exams and I smoked maybe 5 or 6 a day. Now it has been 6 months and I am trying to quit before the addiction gets worse. I bought 2mg nicotine gum to satisfy my cravings at work. I am set on not touching any more cigarettes. My question is how addictive is nicotine gum and what are your past experiences with it, how long do you chew it for, etc.

Struggling to stay stopped!

Hey, been smoke and nicotine free for 6 months and four days. Been doing well, however my dog got sick just over a week ago and had to make the agonising decision to euthanatise him yesterday. He was an 8 year old chocolate Labrador and was adored by me and my family. I have jumped in car with intention to go buy cigs. Really struggling. Any support most welcome. TIA
Ps his name was Humphrey ❤️

Been lurking this thread for a month or so..

I have always known that smoking is bad for me, but never experienced any side effect until recently. I'm 25 and I've been smoking since I was 17, I didn't want to make a post until I knew I was serious. The last cigarette I had was Sunday around noon. Working on 48 hours today at noon, any advice or hints from people that have been here would be appreciated. Doing this cold turkey btw

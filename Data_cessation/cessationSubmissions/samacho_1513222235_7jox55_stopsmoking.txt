Resetting the badge...

While my badge currently says 55 days, I actually didn't make it more than a couple of days this last time. I keep turning to smoking to help alleviate my stress and anxiety because that's what my friends do, but I think it's finally starting to cement in my mind that that's not working for me. It may help temporarily, but it also _causes_ a lot of stress for me. I worry about my health and my financial stability. 

So, I'm going to go for it again. Cold turkey (that's the only way I've ever been even mildly successful). It's going to suck, but it'll be worth it. 

Here we go again.

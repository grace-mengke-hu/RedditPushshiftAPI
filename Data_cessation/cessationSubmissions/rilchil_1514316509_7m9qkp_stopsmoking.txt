Holiday Stress

Damn the holidays are the worst. It’s been over 2 years since my last cig and about 1 month nic free (finally quit the vape). Been about 7 months no alcohol. This is the first time in a while that I’ve really craved a cig and a case of beer. Just thinking about a yellow pack of american spirits and a 30 pack of miller high life got me questioning everything. Tryna stay strong over here.

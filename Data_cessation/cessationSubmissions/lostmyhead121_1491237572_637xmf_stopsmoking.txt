2 months, 8 days, 20 hours

I've managed to be smoke free for 2 months! I know its not a long period of time but it honestly was a struggle to get to this point. Not one more smoke! I don't even miss it when I see someone smoking around me....with my sense of smell back, my god that stale smell is gag inducing. You guys are great and really motivating! I didn't think I could stop smoking (with a pack every day and a half for 12 years) but thanks for the motivation! :)

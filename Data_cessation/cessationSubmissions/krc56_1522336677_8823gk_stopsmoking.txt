How many ways are there to quit smoking?

I quit while I was sick and in the hospital so I couldn't smoke even if I tried. It got me wondering, how many different scenarios are there for quitting smoking? I'm sure there's a ton! Divorce, car accidents lighting cigarettes, college stuff, work stuff...

I. just. can't. do. it

Hey...
I read the Allan Carr book 15 years ago.  It didn't work.  I read it two years ago, it worked for 24 hours.  I read it just recently....so bloody determined but it didn't work - I smoked the following day (that was yesterday).  I know the book is good but it's not clicking for me.  How can I make it click???  What is WRONG with me.  I have the worst withdrawal feelings ever...the cravings are insane.  I turn into a monster....  I was about to try the Jason Vale app, but I'm worried it wont work either and that I'll never ever quit.  Any advice at all would be greatly received.... thanks

Burning sensation in lungs after quitting

I'm not a redditor but I know you guys are quick to answer and help. I can't find anything on the internet about burning sensation in lungs after quitting. Anybody else have that? It's been 2 weeks since I smoked. I lost my health insurance so I can't afford doctor bills right now. Thanks

Why wait?

I've always had a habit of setting a specific date to quit smoking, usually my birthday, but I'll pass the day by without thinking about the goal I set for myself. So I'm turning 30 in three weeks, but it finally seems like such a long time to wait to quit. There's no real reason for me to wait until my birthday or even until the end of this basically, brand new pack I have, even though I know I will finish this pack. I should finish it by Thursday night, so Friday will be the day that I officially quit. I've set myself another arbitrary date to quit. I will come back on Friday and get my little smiley face guy.

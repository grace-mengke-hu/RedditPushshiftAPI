Quit Day! Advice?

Today is my quit day and I am feeling pretty good so far. I wanted to see if anyone had some advice or tips they could offer for getting through the cravings and changing habits? I am using Champix this time, which is new for me. Has anyone gone this route before? Smoking made me feel soooooo sick when taking this medication.

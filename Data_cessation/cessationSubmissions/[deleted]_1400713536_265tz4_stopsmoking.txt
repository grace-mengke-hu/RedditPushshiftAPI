I'm on day 3 and I just wanted to say $#&W%*(&$%*(W&%(*#&$(* you.

This is terrible. 

This is horrible.

I am going to die.

I keep coughing, get headaches, can't think straight, I literally just sat at work for like 2 hours staring at a screen cause my head hurt too much to do anything. 

I have so much more to bitch about but I'm too fucking out of it to say anything. ROAOAROWUROAURIOAEUIOEGHIOEGHIOEHGOIEHGIOEHGIO. 

Fuck Cigarettes.

Fuck the cavs.

Fuck you.

Fuck Reddit.

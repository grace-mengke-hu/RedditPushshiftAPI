Last!

Just wanted to post, more for me than anything. I've been a pack a day smoker for about ten years. 

I've had many attempts but right now will be my last cigarette. My kido turns two next week and I want to see her turn many more years. 

I've got my support group and a solid plan in place, and a picture of my baby taped to my lighter. 

Power to those on the quits and to those quitting, let's do it!

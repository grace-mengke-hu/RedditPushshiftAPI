Relapsed after one week, quitting again. I feel like it will be easier this time.

Hello everyone, as I mentioned in my old posts, I'm 18 years old and I've been smoking for about half a year now and I decided to quit last week to prevent future health issues. It's an exceptionally hard time in my life (senior year, relationships, etc.) and I felt like I needed to smoke to get through it.

...

At least, that's what I thought until today.

Let me tell you the story of my day: I started smoking again this morning. I smoked about 13 cigarettes the whole day and ONLY enjoyed the very first one (enjoyment lasted for about 15 seconds, something simple like eating a chocolate bar would've made me so much happier for a longer period of time). As I mentioned, I'm having problems in my life and all the cigarettes I smoked today only made it worse. I remember smoking my last cigarette of the day (and hopefully, my life) in a filthy garage in the freezing cold air (smoking is forbidden in high school). I had a Coca-Cola to go along with the cigarette and I took a moment to think about what I was doing. I was shaking because of the cold, not enjoying anything and hurting my body at the same time. The cola made the cig taste so awful that I had to throw it away after smoking for like a minute and a half. It was DISGUSTING. I washed my face in disgust and almost burst into tears because I realized what my addiction was doing to me.

At the end of the day, I was left with:

* -â‚º10
* Awful smell
* Awful taste in my mouth
* Can barely breathe
* Severe headache
* No energy

IT'S NOT WORTH IT. I refused to give the rest of my pack to my friends who wanted them, I broke them in half and threw it in the bin. After today, I don't feel like I relapsed, I feel like I learned an important lesson and it changed my life. Not installing any apps on my phone or anything because:

**I AM A NON-SMOKER.**

I'm legit pissed off at cigarettes right now. Not letting a piece of shit control my life. I'll just remember this day when I crave and make fun of my brain for craving.

Good luck to everyone!

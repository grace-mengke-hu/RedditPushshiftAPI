Dilemma: stopped smoking but what about other substitutes

Background: I used to be a “heavy” smoker, around a pack a day. Sometimes at weekends more especially with drinking.

I stopped smoking for almost two months after 14 years now and it’s working great because I don’t take anything that has nicotine or inhale anything. 

I have friends that smoke water pipes, joints, cigars and more. However I find myself lately thinking of trying a few hits of a joint because I “defeated addiction” I don’t see myself as a smoker anymore and don’t want to smoke cigarettes. 

However I’m afraid of denying myself the experience of getting high with friends for the rest of my life.

Has anyone else sustained that way of smoking without starting to smoke again?

One month today...help

I never thought that I would get this far...but here I am! I made an account just to post this because I am terrified. It has been surprisingly smooth sailing so far, I am just waiting for it to hit me and I cave. Has anyone else felt like this? It's worth noting that this is my first quit attempt, and I'm using patches. So I am still 'addicted' to the nicotine. I am worried that when I go down a patch I will find it much harder than I have so far? 

Please send me your experiences! I am so scared that I can't do this...

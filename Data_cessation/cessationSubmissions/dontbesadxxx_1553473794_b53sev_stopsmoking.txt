5th time’s the charm?

Today I am quitting for the 5th and (hopefully) final time and am in desperate need of reminders how many benefits quitting has. 

The hardest part for me in the past has been having to give up drinking simultaneously as I don’t enjoy it without cigarettes. So basically having to give up two extremely awful addictions at once.

Anyone care to share positive quitting stories?

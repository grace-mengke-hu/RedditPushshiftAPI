Pills that are hard to swallow...

Just a rant, maybe this is better in /r/stopdrinking, but I feel like it's a direct correlation to my quit smoking journey, so I'm posting it here.  The background of it is, I quit drinking along with smoking, because it's hard to drink and maintain the self control required to not smoke.

The other day I had plans with a friend, but when this person was asking me where I wanted to go, my response was "I don't really care, I'm not drinking, so whatever you want to do is fine with me"  This person then proceeded to break our plans, citing that they didn't want to hang out if I wasn't going to be drinking.  I haven't dissected this rejection too much, so I am not sure if I should be reading in between the lines, how I took it was that I'm no longer fun to hang out with unless I'm smoking/drinking.

I am now terrified of how many of my other friends will be fair-weather friends, and not interested in hanging out with me in my new sober endeavors.  I know if they act like this then they weren't my true friends to begin with, but how many of them will turn out to be these "not true friends?"  I'm feeling very lonely here on week 2 of my quit, and I'm really not sure I'm ready to confront this.

Am pretty damn happy I forgot my 1 year anniversary :)

So technically a very kind and considerate friend sent congratulations to me, I think the week before last, but I completely forgot it until he did, and then forgot to celebrate the day of... and that makes me feel so free. 

I logged in today to see what my count was, cus again, I had no idea, and not knowing ahead of time, not counting the days anymore...

I feel unencumbered in a way that is hard to describe. Like at one point nicotine owned real-estate in my brain and now it's been removed from the landed class and just sends me angry letters on occasion (which I promptly shred).

If you're feeling shackled, just remember, those chains will erode with time, they'll shatter and break and turn to dust and someday you will have to be reminded that you ever wore them.

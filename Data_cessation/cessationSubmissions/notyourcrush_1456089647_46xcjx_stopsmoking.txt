This is my second day without a cigarette.

Hi Reddit ! Ive been lurking around for a long time, but after discovering this subreddit, I decided to join.
I started smoking in 2014 september. I remember it was not a conscious decision, it somehow happened to me.   I always hated cigarettes, the smoke, the smell.. i dont even know why i decided to taste my first one. This thing is sneaky. Also this isnt my first try. The longest time without cigarettes was ten days, but I let myself down, as always. 
One year ago I went camping with friends. I transformed into a fucking chimney. This lasted one week, and every night we sat down and drank. Now, when I drink, I lose control over cigarettes.. I smoked and smoked, sometimes not giving myself a fresh breath between two ciggies. Note that I roll my ciggies, because that is cheaper than buying packs, but as probably you know it is far more stronger..I went to bed later.. then I felt that i couldnt breathe properly. I had to fight for every single breath, I had to manually move my lungs, and I sounded like darth vader on his deathbed. I felt miserable.  The smell was the worst, because I brought it home..  that is one thing  I couldnt hide from my family. And seeing my parents being sad and disappointed.. 
Reading your stories helped, though. It was amazing to see posts flooded with kind and supporting comments. It is truly motivating. I normally dont use such sentences, I feel like theyre clich√©.. but it really applies to this subreddit. Thanks to you, I started to quit, now more determined than ever. I know, Im  not a world champion with my two days, but I wanted to share this, and I wish the best to all of you. :)

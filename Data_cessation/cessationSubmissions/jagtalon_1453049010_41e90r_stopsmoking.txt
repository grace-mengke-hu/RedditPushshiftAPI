Today is my last day smoking!

I am joining the ranks of non-smoker tomorrow.  I've bought the patch, as it has helped me quit in the past.  I'm also getting gum and sunflower seeds today.  Anything else you guys recommend?  I have quit for a year twice in the past so I somewhat know what I am getting into.  Thanks for any advice and kind words in advance!

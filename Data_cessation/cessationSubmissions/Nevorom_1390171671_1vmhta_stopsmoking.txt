Holy shit, I want a cigarette right now.

I want is so bad right now, it hurts. I haven't had a craving like this since day three. I am stressing like hell right now. My wife flew out to Bahrain to visit me (I am stationed out here til July) and it was great! We had a great time, saw some sights, did a little shopping, and just generally enjoyed each others company. Well, she flew back to the U.S. on Saturday and I know that statistically she'll be fine. However, I'm a bit of a control freak and I have no control over anything if anything did happen. I'm getting jittery just fucking thinking about it.

In a foreign country by yourself, worrying over your wife, and you used to smoke as a stress reliever.... Fuck me!

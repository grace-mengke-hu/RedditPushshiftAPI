New guy here

Whats up everyone, I'm Patrick,  and I have been a smoker for about 3 years or so(cigs and vapes, depending on what I was in the mood for). It was a bad habit I picked up from a friend who is a smoker. 

Last night I decided I was done. I threw out my cigs and threw away my vape. My official first day, wish me luck(counter says 2 days, gotta change that)

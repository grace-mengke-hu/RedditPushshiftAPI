What worked for me (now in 5 easy steps!)

I was recently reminded that my method was pretty unconventional but effective, so I thought I'd share it here after seeing something about smoking over at r/lpt

1. Obtain small jar
2. Fill 1/4 jar with cig butts/ashtray contents
3. Add water to cover elements in step 3.
4. Close Lid.
5. Upon craving, open jar, deeply inhale through your nose, dry heave and repeat as necessary.

I had always found the smell of wet cigarette butts disgusting, and after watching a friend's dog smell a wet butt and subsequently heave, I thought I'd try the same approach.

I'd like to think this will help just one person, if so, my cheezey clickbaitish title was not in vain!

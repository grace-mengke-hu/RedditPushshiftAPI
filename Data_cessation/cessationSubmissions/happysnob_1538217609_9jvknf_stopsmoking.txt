Quitting tonight!

Very excited. This is attempt 174829203, but I’m finally going to rock this. Reading Carr for the fourth time, lol. Do you have any tips for websites or books on quitting smoking? Not the flashy ones with capslock, I’m looking for calm, optimistic blogs, ifyouknowwhatimean. 
By the way, I have been a 20-a-day smoker since I was fourteen. I’m 22 now and an university student - the combination of alcohol and tabacco is really difficult to me.

A few hours in..

Hello! 

Same story as most of you I'm sure. I am 23 right now, and my first experience with nicotine was around age 16, just single cigars here and there. Eventually it hooked me. It actually was such a surprise(facepalm) because I have also had issues with weed, and I started mixing tobacco with it. A few months later I realised the great mistake I made.

Anyways here I am. Last year I was able to make it 2 months smoke free, and can't believe I'm back here again. Also now I have this fear that I will quit only to make the same mistake. However I thin it's a good sign I have come here for some anonymous support. I want a better life. Just venting here helps and thanks also to everyone who posts and replies. I'm a few hours nicotine free and ready to take on this fucking withdrawal lol.

Happy breathing everyone..

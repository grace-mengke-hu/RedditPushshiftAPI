Introduction from a new member. Hi! My name is BatM and I'm a smoker.

Allow me to introduce myself…

I started smoking in 1967, at a very tender age. Pretty much the typical stuff: swiped a pack from a relative to share with friends, I didn’t much like it (gack) but I wanted to be cool and smoking *was* cool. I grew to like it and soon was smoking regularly. For 12 years. 

In 1979, after a bunch of failed attempts at quitting (I thought of them as practice runs) I finally settled in on a plan to quit that worked. I bought a new car and never smoked in the thing – I actually threw the lighter away. A few months later I got a new job and never smoked at work. Then I moved to a new apartment and didn’t smoke there – including throwing the ashtrays away. A little hypnosis seemed to help but I’m not sure, what I do know is that in the course of a year I found myself only smoking after work while having a drink at a neighborhood bar.  I dried out for a couple of months and was finally able to call myself a non-smoker.  For 7 years. 

In 1986, living in a new city with a new job and a disastrous marriage, I collapsed. Sitting with my pants around my ankles in a toilet in a bar off Rush Street in Chicago, I had a smoke. Yeah, that was cool. To this day I don’t know what the final trigger was but I bummed a cigarette and that was all it took.  It was like finding a long lost friend – we hugged, we rejoiced, and I got busy making up for lost time. Of course, like most folks, smoking didn’t actually make me feel better or even better about myself but none of that was important enough to get me to stop. For 16 years.

Eventually, in 2001, my life realigned itself (new job, new wife, new home) and I made the decision to stop. I was getting older and the smoking was mucking up my lungs and my stamina and it was time. Long past time but there you have it. After several failed attempts on my own (these I did not call practice runs, I simply couldn’t do it on my own) I saw my doctor, who prescribed drugs (Welbutrin) and therapy and I enlisted the help of my family and friends. It was a hard process and the drugs were weird (but essential, I believe) and I *hated* group therapy but it took. My Valentine’s Day gift to my new wife in February of 2002 was to quit, I had my last cigarette the day before.

It has been 14 years and counting. 

Things I have learned during my lifelong struggle with tobacco:

* I’m a ‘smokaholic.’ Like drunks, I will never be cured. That doesn’t mean that I have to smoke, it’s up to me to decide, day-by-day, moment-by-moment, if I’m going to smoke. The urge never goes away completely even though it visits me much less often and with much less insistence than it did. Never drop your guard, no matter how long it has been since your last smoke.

* Falling off the wagon doesn’t mean you can’t get your ass back on the wagon. No matter how many times you fail, you aren’t a failure until you stop trying. Yoda said, "Do. Or do not. There is no trying." but that doesn't mean that you always succeed on the first (or 428th) attempt. What he really meant was commit yourself fully and never give up, never surrender!

* When the urge strikes, it helps to talk to someone. I’ve found that talking to smokers and ex-smokers is problematic:  they’re very sympathetic but they often have a ‘can’t do’ attitude that comes from having seen failure so many times before. The people I need to talk to are the ‘never smoked in their life’ crowd, who can’t comprehend smoking and think I’m borderline nuts for struggling with it but have an absolutely unbudgeable belief that anyone can quit if they decide they want to. They can be self-righteous prigs but they know instinctively exactly where on my butt to apply the tip of their shoe and they do so without mercy. 

* Quitting on your own is a short path back to smoking – get help. Group helped, at least initially;  having some comrades that were fighting the same battles made it an ‘us against the world’ thing. Eventually, however, group became an even more powerful negative reinforcement: if the requirement for not going to group was to stay smoke free, then I was going to do whatever it took not to have to spend another hour with those chuckleheads.  See your doctor. If you don’t have insurance, it’s expensive but so is smoking – I know what I’d rather spend my money on. If you have insurance, they will gladly pay almost anything to help you quit because they know it will save them money in the long run. Drugs to stop are a bit controversial but for me they were a critical component - probably the most important component - to my success fourteen years ago. Welbutrin is sick shit but it helped me quit smoking so I love it. I think the hypnotherapy helped a little but I also think spending an hour a week in quiet contemplation of how fucking stupid smoking was might have been just as beneficial. In the long run, do whatever it takes.

* Quit for your family and friends. Kids, especially, help us take a long view on life and nobody with a long view is going to want to smoke. To this day, I carry a photo of my family in my wallet so that I can have something to look at to remind me why I’m not going to smoke.
* Quit for yourself. It’s nice if there are people in your life that you want to quit for but the real reason has to come from within. You’ll feel better physically (and live longer) but you’ll also feel better about yourself. I want to prove to myself that I can master this.
* Ultimately, quitting is up to you so do whatever it takes. Well, okay, sacrificing small animals by the light of a full moon is probably excessive but there are going to be sacrifices you will be called upon to make. You are the one who lights the thing, you are the one who puts it in your mouth and inhales, you are the one it will eventually kill. It starts with a decision and, in the long run, the decision to quit is so worth it.

It’s been 14 years since I had my last cigarette and the reason I’m here is I had a little urge a few days ago. My birthday, dinner out with cocktails afterward; and there was that little voice in the back of my head, murmuring, “this would be a really good time for a cigarette.” This was the first time in many, many months and it was easy to resist – indeed, my immediate response was an electric, “where the hell did that come from, and hell NO, it is not” but the voice *was* there and I want to kill it *dead*.

Don't slip but if you do, pick yourself up, dust yourself off and start all over again.

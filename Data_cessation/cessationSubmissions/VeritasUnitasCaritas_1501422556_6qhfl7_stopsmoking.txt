Day 19 challenge

After a solid 17 years of smoking, I quit. I stopped doing all of the things I associate with smoking. No alcohol. No coffee. No sitting on my patio at night. Then the most awesome thing happened: I got pneumonia. It was fucking awful, but I couldn't smoke. I couldn't even be tempted to smoke. I wouldn't wish pneumonia on my enemies but I really think it was helpful. I kept up with the limits I put on myself(alcohol, coffee, etc.) and It's worked so far. 18 days and counting.

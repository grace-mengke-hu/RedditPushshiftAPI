Need help with an electronic cigarette decision

so i decided to quit and ive been purchasing the Njoy disposable cigarettes from 7/11. I used to smoke half a pack a day, and these disposable cigarettes say they equal to two packs. **however, i keep finishing a whole Njoy disposable cigarette in 6 to 8 hours.** 
  * im guessing they have some advertising loophole where its equal to the nicotine of 20 cigarettes, but not the amount of smoke

**My question is,whats the best high-end electronic cigarette to buy? One of the e-cigs with refillable containers. Because if i buy one Njoy a day, thats 54$ a week, give or take, so in the long run i'd be saving money with a non-disposable.**

**Tl;DR , whats the best e-cig on the market?**

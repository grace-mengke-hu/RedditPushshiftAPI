Today is the day!

I relapsed after quitting for a month and a half about 7 months ago. I just reset my badge and if I had just stuck it out last time, I would have been at 274 days today. In the time I've been smoking since then, I have lost all of my energy, my lung capacity is shot and I have trouble sleeping. I'm so disatisfied with my life as a smoker, and am ready for a major lifestyle change. 

Tomorrow I'm starting cross fit classes as part of a challenge amongst my co workers, and will be changing my eating habits tomorrow as well. Today is my first day without cigarettes, and I know strength will come one day at a time. I'm excited to be back on /stopsmoking, because this was a major source of inspiration and support for me last time! Glad to be back and looking forward to life as a person who beat the war against cigarettes!

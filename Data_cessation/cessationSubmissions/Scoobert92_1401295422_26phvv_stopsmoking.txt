Day Three! Attempt Two!

Tried to quit about a year ago and quit for six months but it didn't stick. Both times I tried weaning a bit, but mostly cold turkey. I have a very mild headache and my lungs are evacuating yellow phlegm, but I know this is the right choice. I'm doing pretty good, but going by smokey bars is the worst, I'm disgusted and want a cigarette at the same time! My Partner and I have both been trying to quit for a while. He has been quit for a month. I'm really concerned that we will get sick if we continue smoking cigarettes and I'm sure it has been impeding our quality of life. the statistics for smoker death by smoking are really bad. I'm proud of us and I will keep trying.

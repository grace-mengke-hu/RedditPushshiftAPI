Checking in on day 3

It's day 3 of not vaping... I've been trying to escape nicotine's death grip for what feels like years now.

Stopping by this sub to see that little badge is one of the things that keeps me going.

Getting rid of this habit has been one of the hardest things I've ever had to do.

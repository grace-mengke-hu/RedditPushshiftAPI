How long after quitting until neurotransmitters return to their normal functionality?

From what I've read, nicotine acts as an agonist, affecting various neurotransmitters including dopamine, ACh, serotonin, etc. Does this mean that these neurotransmitters are not functioning at their full potential without the influence of nicotine? And if so how long after quitting until these neurotransmitters return to their normal functionality?

I asked on r/neuroscience and got [this informative response](http://www.reddit.com/r/neuroscience/comments/1wvdiu/how_long_after_quitting_smoking_until/cf5qva9) from u/thehorrorfrog

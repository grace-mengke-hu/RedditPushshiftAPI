Around 40 days non smoker and this happened...

...so recently i got cold at work and felt i am going to to be sick. I felt this way before like 20 times and every time it led me to pretty horrible sickness - nausea, headaches, temperature, running nose and worst of it some kind of infected lungs and non stop dry coughing. During sickness period i cannot leave home for ~10 days and get better without course of antibiotics. It doesn't matter if it's winter or summer, if i get somehow cold (eating lots of icecream or get cold feet, etc) i'm out for min. 10 days. So, i was getting these same symphtoms EXCEPT lung and coughing part. And after few days i'm starting to feel better. If it's because i'm not smoking i cannot thank myself more for quitting and gonna keep going with what i'm doing. Keep strong my quitting fellass!

Day 2 and Feeling Good

Trust me I know Day 2 isn't much. It's far from my first time making it here, but something's different this time. Usually I turn into a total asshole after 10 hours without a cig, but I feel great right now.

This is the first time in a long time I've actually felt like I can quit smoking. Keep it up everybody.

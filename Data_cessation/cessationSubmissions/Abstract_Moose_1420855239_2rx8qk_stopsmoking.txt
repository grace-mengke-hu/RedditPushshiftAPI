Four hours into day three. I feel like the world is coming to an end.

I still feel strong, I won't smoke, but holy crap my cravings have been intense today. At times I really feel like I am losing my mind. I'm trying to stay positive and busy but sometimes i just can't even focus anymore. I ended up taking a drink, which made me want to smoke more. Won't make that mistake again. I've gotten a lot of exercise today, and at points I've felt really good, but right now I'm hanging on by the skin of my teeth. Everyone says it gets better.

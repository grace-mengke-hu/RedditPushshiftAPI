Self harm increasing with quitting?

Ive had self harm issues since adolescence but I luckily quit cutting/burning two years ago. However occasionally I slip into punching myself in the head when I get excessively stressed/angry

Anyhow I quit smoking 5 days ago and it really sucks not having that outlet for stress and stuff like punching myself and other extreme stress stuff has increased, partly due to increased agitation+ lacking the smoking outlet. Have any of you all experienced similar issues? How do you all cope when stuff gets intensely stressful or angry?

The glass walkway at work

I just started a new job, so there is no one in this company that knew me as a smoker. The company is housed in two large buildings with a glass walkway in the middle.  On on side, it has lots of greenery, very lovely and on the other...smoking area. There is a structure similar to a bus stop with benches.  I walk through this area everyday. The first year of quitting, I know that I would have envied those people, maybe even tempted to join. 

Now, I just feel...sad for them. I want to run out there and shout "You can quit this shit! You can! Look at me! I did it, I'm weak, but I did it, you can too!"  And then pass out copies of Easy Way.

As a smoker, I know what I would have thought of anyone who wanted to chat me up about quitting without solicitation, so of course, I would never even attempt anything remotely like it. 

But I am so happy that all I feel for them is sadness, I have 0 desire to be among them, enslaved to my next hit.

and woo hoo, I think I'm nearing 2 years, gtfo!

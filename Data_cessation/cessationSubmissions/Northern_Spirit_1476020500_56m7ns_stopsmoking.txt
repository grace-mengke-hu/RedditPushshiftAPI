day 2 and I'm board!

Hey, long time lurker here. I'm on day 2. Its a rainy day today and I'm soo board out of my mind! I'm going crazy from cravings. I used to just smoke rainy days away but now I can't and I have all this extra time on my hands and nothing to do! What do you guys do to fill up the extra time? Keep in mind I need indoor activities. I'd take a walk or ride my bike or something but its raining pretty hard out there today. I'm an open minded person so any and all advice is appreciated. Thanks in advance!

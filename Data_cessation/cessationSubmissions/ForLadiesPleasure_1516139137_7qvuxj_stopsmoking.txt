I'm close to day 3 without cigarette and I'm extremely close on giving up

It's a torture, **I'm literally carving all the time**. This is the first time I've been able to stay without a cigarette this long (i usually never went without a cigarette for more than 16 hours). I'm trying anything, eating sugar sticks, drinking liters of water, eating like a pig... It's a constant carving this is pure suffer i swear.
I've been a smoker since i was 11 years old (i know that's f*cked up) now I'm 20, i hate smoking I'm sick of smoking but I'm extremely addicted.

Can someone give me some tip just to survive at least day 3? I'm too close on giving up.

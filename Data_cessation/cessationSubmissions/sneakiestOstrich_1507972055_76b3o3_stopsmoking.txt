I'm Quitting (Maybe)

Hey all, so I think I need some advice. I have been smoking now for just about 4 years, since I was 21. Mostly 4 to 5 a day, up to maybe 10 when the insomnia decides to fuck me. Smoking is how I met some of my best friends, and the social aspect is the one thing I think I am going to miss most. 


But here is the thing. My Big Fear. I am working full time, Lead Developer on a major project for a major aerospace corporation. I also am doing grad school, Software Engineering with 2 specialties (Large Systems and Communications). I'm worried that the stress of quitting along with everything else might very well push me back into it, and harder than I am doing now. My grad school finishes in 2 years. 


So here's my question. Should I stick it out, deal with the smoking until I have a bit less on my plate, or should I just go for it. I really want to quit, I'm tired of it all, but I'm also scared to shit that it's going to backfire hard. 


Thanks.

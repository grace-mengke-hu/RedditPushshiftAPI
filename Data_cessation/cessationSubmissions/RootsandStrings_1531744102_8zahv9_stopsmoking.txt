First day and hopefully many more smoke-free days to come

Today will be my first day of quitting. I'm going on a vacation for ten days, which will be filled with activity, healthy food and good people. 

I did this before, but started smoking again after a few weeks home. How can I tackle this problem, when I'm back at home? 

The majority of my friends and colleagues are smokers as well. Besides that I'm in the circle of a lot of artsy people, where smoking appears to be mandatory...

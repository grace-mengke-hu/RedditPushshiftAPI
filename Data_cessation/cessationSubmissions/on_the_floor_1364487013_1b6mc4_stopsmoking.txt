I quit for three weeks and then for the past three days have been back up to 1+ packs a day... please help me.

I quit using the nicotine patch, and admittedly didn't use it for as long as it was recommended- then I hit a very hard patch in my relationship and started again, exactly where I left off. I can feel the health effects hard- how bad smoking is for you is so scarily apparent when you go from not smoking to smoking tons.

I just put left my pack and lighter at home (I went to work), put on another patch, and am on it again.

Does anyone have any advice for me? Motivating thoughts?

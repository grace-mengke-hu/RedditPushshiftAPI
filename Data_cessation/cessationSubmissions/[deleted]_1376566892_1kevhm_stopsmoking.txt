the last 15 cigarettes i'll ever smoke

after several attempts that didn't last very long - each about 2 days - im trying to go the official way and let people know that i'm really quitting this time. seriously.

right in front of me is a pack of marlboro gold with about 15 cigs left (the pack was 5 â‚¬ / 6,64 $). those will be the last cigarettes i'll ever smoke. during this period, i'll finally read the last remaining pages of the easyway-book that i've never finished. 
my concern was always to lose the sociability i currently have as a smoker, but i guess that's just my brain trying to trick me to keep the poison running through my lungs.

do you have any tips on how to keep me busy during the tough times in the beginning? i don't like chewing gum. im exercising, but only three times a week due to work. 
any recommendations on fancy ios-apps that display those non-smoking-statistics would be great too.

thanks in advance, /r/stopsmoking. help me stay strong.

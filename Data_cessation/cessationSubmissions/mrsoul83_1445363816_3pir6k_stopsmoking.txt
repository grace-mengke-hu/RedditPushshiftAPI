How do you deal with party and drinking ?

Basically I stop smoking every sunday, but when I go out with my smoking friends, and have a beer, a little devil hijacks my brain, and all I can think of is smoking a cig.... which I do, shortly after.

This week I have a 10km running event on sunday, so I won't go out drinking for the whole week, and I want to make it a strong starting point for stopping.

Do you have any advice at all ?

Thanks

35 Days!

Hi all, I'm new to this sight and new to quitting smoking. Decided to use the patch but on the first day it wouldn't stick so I went cold turkey. It has been going a lot better than I expected and feel confident that I can keep going! But just in case I thought I would sign up here and get and give some support if needed! My main issue is the cravings obviously. Hoping they will go away forever at some point!! Looking forward to reading up on everyone and their journey!

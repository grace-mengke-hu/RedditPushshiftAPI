First week down, life to go.

I know all of these posts are pretty redundant, but I am happy to have made it 1 week!  As many have said, they have tried to quit hundreds of times without success.  This is the first time I have made it this far without any thought or want to go back.  For me, I was always an end of the day/night smoker.  What has helped me so much is having a cup of tea at the end of the night.  For some reason it keeps my mind of off smoking.  Just my 2 cents.

Here is to the rest of my life!

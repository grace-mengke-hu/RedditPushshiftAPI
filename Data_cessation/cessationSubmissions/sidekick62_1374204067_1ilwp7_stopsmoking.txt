It's Day 10 me redditors, time to grit the teeth

It's been 10 days since my last cigarette, and 3 days since I last had nicotine gum. I'm feeling well enough, but full of energy. Also, having gotten my sense of taste back I've lost my love of the local buffalo wings which has been a blow to morale (I'm sure I'll get over it- I really loved them though). I can taste, I can smell, I can regulate my body temp due to my capillaries working correctly, etc. It's time to grit my teeth, go another 10 days, and kick this habit in the gut. Huzzah & hurrah.

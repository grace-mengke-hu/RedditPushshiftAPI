63 days! And I've passed all the "tests!" It gets easier!

Drinking without smoking? Pfft, easy. Barely think about it.
On campus surrounded by smokers all day, while on Adderall? No problem.
Long carride, with friends who are smoking, while a little tipsy? It's not very effective.
Some kind of combination of all of these? Tempting, but no thanks.

I'm at the point now where my cravings are practically non-existent unless there's a "trigger" present. At that point it's a few seconds of "oh shit I could really use a cigarette". And then it's over. And I don't smell bad afterwards. 

Even the weight I gained is starting to shed off. I'm not quite as skinny as I was when I smoked, but I stopped replacing cravings with food. I can bike across the city and not get out of breath. Hell, I can *walk up stairs* without getting out of breath!

I used a vape pen to quit but I've barely touched it. It's actually broken and I haven't bothered to get it fix in over three weeks.

I'M SO HAPPY! My world hasn't ended yet!

Ugh....holidays

I'm posting to keep myself accountable. This holiday has been horrible with family conflicts and I spent a good part of last night and today in tears. But goddamn it, I haven't smoked and I am not going to smoke.

Thank you all for being here. It really helps to read your posts and remind myself why I quit when I have a craving. Merry fucking Christmas.

Leaving the Big Apple smoke free

I posted a couple times about my temptations to smoke while travelling the last 3 days to the Big Apple. Very happy to report I did not smoke. Thanks for the tips. Mostly just used positive self talk, taking pride in being smoke free. Also went to smoke free event, watching Mad Max at movie theatre. Have a good day good people.

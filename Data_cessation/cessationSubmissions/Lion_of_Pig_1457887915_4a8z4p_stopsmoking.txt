Had my final cigarette 5 hours ago. Cravings beginning to happen, but I'm ready to tackle this bullshit addiction.

Hi everyone. Decided to quit today, this is my second attempt. My first try was an absolute failure, gave into cravings after half a day. What should I do differently this time?

My ideas: When I get irresistible cravings I'll call someone to psych me out or I'll come here.

At the 5 points in my day where I would otherwise have smoked, I'll 1) go running, 2) meditate, 3) make myself a cup of strong ginger tea, 4) do 15 push-ups, and 5) do 30 sit-ups.

I'm not very muscular so that is actually quite a lot for me...

I successfully quit alcohol for the new year, and I'm also giving up shitty food (high salt/refined sugar out) and caffeine at the same time as smoking. You might say, whoa, quit one thing at a time, but no, for me consuming caffeine and comfort food always goes hand in hand with a cig. Cut out the triggers, yo.

Whatever, we'll see how it goes. To my mind you should either smoke without guilt or just stop smoking. No point in beating yourself up every time you have a cigarette. That's a feedback loop of self-loathing. So maybe I'll fail again this time but if so I'll start afresh soon after with a stronger resolve. But anyway, I feel pretty sure this is it.

Please give me supportive comments below, feed my hype, give me gentle advice, anecdotes from your own quitting experience, tell me I'm full of shit. Any support you can give this ashtray-smelling schmuck is hugely treasured and appreciated. Thanks <3

I want to become a quitter! Do you guys have tips?

I am having a really hard time to stop smoking, every attempt I made failed.

I promised myself when I would finish school, I also would quit smoking. Now that I have graduated, the time has come. 

I am new to this subreddit, and I am thrilled to hear your stories of how you quit and what i took.

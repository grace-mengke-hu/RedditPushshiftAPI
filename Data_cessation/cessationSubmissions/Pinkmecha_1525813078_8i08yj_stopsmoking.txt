Quitting after college

Hello, This is my first post ever in a forum. I know that smoking is terrible for me and I’ve went through a lot of quitting and re-entering the habit which is why I’m looking for a community centered around quitting. I’ve continued this Mostly because I have severe anxiety and depression and throughout my college years I used it to cope with the stress and ease my anxiety throughout the semester. I recently just graduated and I really want to make a change in my habits and quit for good. The problem is, i have a lot of friends who smoke (not cigarettes but weed) and they always want to role blunts and use heavy tobacco whenever we hangout. It pretty much stops me from ever completing my goals because it’s kind of like their bonding ritual. 

I haven’t smoked a cigarette in at least a year but if it’s not that it’s spliffs (weed and tobacco) or an occasional black and mild. I can really feel the effects on my productivity and I’m looking for some positive reinforcement and helpful links to help me get back on track. I’m not opposed to prescription for anxiety and depression and even though I know it will probably change my mood or habits, I feel as if smoking is already causing more adverse effects. 

Thanks for reading :)

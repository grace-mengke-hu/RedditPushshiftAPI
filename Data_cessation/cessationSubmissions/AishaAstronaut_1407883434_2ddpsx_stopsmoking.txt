What worked for me

So my smoke free app has told me to write a list of what worked for me so far in quitting and staying quit and post it here.
I'll be honest, I've found in relatively easy. There were some moments where I needed help though, so here's what worked.

1) my dad - he hated me smoking. He stopped bothering me about it but he was so happy when I quit and he's so proud whenever I tell him about a new milestone or a temptation avoided that I could never go back. All other reasons aside, I won't let him down.
2) Allen carr - I had some illusions about smoking as we all do, the social thing, the special cigarettes, the routine, the "I enjoy it" - Allen carr's explanations and talking through it all finally got rid of any desire to smoke ever again
3) smoke free (the app) - checking in on how I'm doing on a rough day or just for fun is always nice :) plus, the missions are cool and hae definitely helped.
4) you guys! The support here has been amazing and reading your experiences and encouragement has helped so much. Thank you all! :)

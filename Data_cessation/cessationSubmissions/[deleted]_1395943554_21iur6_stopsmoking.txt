I'm starting my quitting journey using nicotine patches.

Hey there everyone! Day two here, my first post, and first serious time I've committed to quitting. 

I'm skeptical about these patches. They are helping tremendously with the withdrawal symptoms, and the only downside is the irritating itch I get when first applying it. The thing I'm wondering is if it's really necessary to take it for the amount of time they tell you to? I'm on step one: 21mg a day for 6 weeks. After step one follows step two for two weeks, and step three for another two.. I'm wondering why step 1 is so long, and if it can be shortened without having negative effects in quitting. The paranoid side of me is also wondering if this is just a way for them to squeeze some more money out of your wallet.

Any input, personal experiences, or advice would be helpful. Thanks!

Best news ever: My sister quit too! :D

Okay so.I'm on day 18 (i think) and going strong. My sister and I are only 10 months and 30 days apart. They call us Irish Twins. We are best friends and live next door to one another. When i first quit, one of my biggest struggles was being unable to spend time with her because she and her wife still smoked like chimneys inside. Thankfully, she quit 2 weeks into my quit and I'm trying to support her and give her someone to talk to but she's acting like she has zero withdrawl or cravings or emotional upheaval. Lol. 
I didn't tell her how difficult week 1 was because she was considering quitting and i figured i would just support her through it when the time came and didn't want to scare her out if quitting, but we've always been competitive so now she feels like she has to win at quitting or something. Haha. 
Hey... I'm not complaining. She quit. Kudos to her. I'm still going to keep checking in with her and make sure she knows she can talk to me if she wants. I'm just happy that she quit, because now there is no smoking inside her home, so her wife has to smoke outside. Now i get to hang out over there without coming home smelling like an ashtray. Woohoo! 


(All that being said... I still win at quitting because I'll always have 2 weeks more than her! *insert evil maniacal laughter here*)

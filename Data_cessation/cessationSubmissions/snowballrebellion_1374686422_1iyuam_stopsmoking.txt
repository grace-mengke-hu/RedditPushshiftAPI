Mother's Birthday = My New Beginning

I've been smoking about a pack a day for the past 5 years. My mother hates that I smoke and has constantly reminded me of the financial, social, and health disadvantages of my addiction. I have always ignored them. But today is her birthday, and also my first day in becoming smoke free. I figured it would be a great surprise to her... And I will feel super guilty if I let her down! I can't wait to be free of my addiction and the horrible lifestyle that comes along with it.  This ones for you Mom!

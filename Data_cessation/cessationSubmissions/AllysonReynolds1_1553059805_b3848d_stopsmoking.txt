Extreme coughing since quitting?

Hi. I am 33. I have been smoking since I was 16 and I stopped for the first time 33 days ago. I stopped cold turkey. In the last 3 weeks ive coughed so badly that at times i can not breath. It lasts for up to 5 minutes at a time and it is scary. Afterwards, i have so much phlegm in my chest amd nose its utterly awful. I never coughed wheni smoked and now it feels like i have whooping cough. Has anyone else ever experienced this? Is this normal?

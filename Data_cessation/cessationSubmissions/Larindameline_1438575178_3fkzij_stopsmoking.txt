Spidey senses

It's Day 22, and my taste buds are definitely coming back.

I smoked for 10 years and strawberries were great. Now that my taste is returning, strawberries are super tart and intense. And I'm finding that I don't need to put Tabasco on everything cause I can taste the flavors. 

I hope this continues, it's the easiest physical change (along with my sense of smell) that I notice.

Still on the patches and lozenges, and that's helped so much. Also my emotions are starting to pick up since I quit. 

Had some sleeping issues this week, but I don't think about smoking when I open my eyes in the morning anymore. 

I don't ever wanna go through that first week again, so if anyone is there, hang on, it gets better! I look forward to seeing what's around the corner. 

Cigarette smoke from other people still smells good sometimes and randomly, I saw some people smoking and the sight of the smoke made me feel nostalgic, like seeing an old friend. (I used to see like 50 clouds of cig smoke a day.)

Lots of weird stuff I didn't see coming, but my breathing has improved. Grateful I made it another 24 hours

Thank you, /r/stopsmoking.

Simple as that.  I wouldn't have gotten through this without the friendly support and encouragement I found in /r/stopsmoking.  I wouldn't have done it without Allen Carr's book, either, which was suggested to me by some of that friendly support here.  It's a godsend.

To everyone who wants to stop smoking but isn't sure they can do it:  You can.  This sub is filled to the brim with friendly souls who want to help you.  Take advantage of it, and take control of this one piece of your life, and you will feel much better for it in a very short time.

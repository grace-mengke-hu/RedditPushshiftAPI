Sooo when do the withdrawals start kicking my ass?

its been 5 days, I quit on a whim, smoked half a pack a day, for about 6 yrs. I have yet to have a craving. Im scared Ill wake up a week from now  and go on a killing spree looking for nicotine(kidding...hopefully?) I know everyone reacts differently but its been a little too easy since my last cig, am I overthinking it? Im known for overthinking stuff. Thanks in advance guys and gals.

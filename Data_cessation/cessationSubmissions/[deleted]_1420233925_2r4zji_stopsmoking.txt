New here - Five days quit

I stopped smoking on 28th December, it wasn't a 'New Year resolution' , but I knew I would have the time and space to commit to not smoking and the physical and psychological effects that go with it, without the added pressure of work etc.. just taking one small step at a time...
Good luck to everyone who is also on this journey...

Here we go again.

I failed at my last quit. I smoked my pack a day every day since then. I just read easyway, and i can do it this time. My last quit was a willpower quit, and i recognize that it failed because i thought i was making a sacrifice. I'm much more mentally prepared this time. I'm a non smoker as of right this second. I extinguished my last one. It was gross. I'm done. I don't need to smoke anymore.

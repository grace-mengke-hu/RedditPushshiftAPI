2 Years 3 months Smoke Free! :)

I'm 28 and I smoked a pack of cigarettes a day for 10 years. I like other smoker's tried many times to stop and failed. I tried all different methods to stop: patches, gum, champ ix etc but never worked for me. It wasn't until I came across Allan Carr's book  " The only way to stop smoking" where they take the psychology approach to help you stop smoking and take that fear away and gives you your power back! Anyway I read half the book and I knew this was for me and I booked the clinic session (optional and costs more but worth it as they offer money back guarantee) I attended the clinic where we went through the psychological process of quitting. After 4 hours I walked out there smoke free and never looked back! I can be around smokers and it doesn't bother me in the slightest! I never get the urge to put another cigarette in my mouth again!

This was the method that worked for me and hopefully it can work for somebody else on here.

Good luck everybody and never give up! :)

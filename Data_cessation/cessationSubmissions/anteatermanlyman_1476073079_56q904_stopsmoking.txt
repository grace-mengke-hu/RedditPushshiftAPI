Sometimes I mistake caffeine withdrawal for nic fits

Anyone else? I am starting to realize this from trying quite a few times. Hell if I just try to quit. But, this is the second time I've had a lot of coffee or an energy drink when the nic fits come and they're much easier to bear. I also think a lot about how smoking one cigarette doesn't really relieve my withdrawals, and I end up just smoking the whole pack really fast.

Albeit, I'm on the patch right now. I just know the patch wasn't working very well until I started to spend a little more on caffeine. I was brought up on coffee lol, so I'm probably addicted to that too.

Also, day 2 right now, wish me luck :). I will keep trying

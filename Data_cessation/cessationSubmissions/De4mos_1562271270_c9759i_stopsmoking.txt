Tomorrow is on

I posted here a while ago about my plan to quit smoking after finishing my exams.

I'm an 18 year old boy, smoking since 15. I finished my last exam today and also smoked the last cigarette. Trying a cold turkey starting tomorrow.

Wish me luck. Also, good luck to all the redditors here who try to stop as well.

Day 26 without smoking and having some health issues. Is this normal??

I've always had an issue with anxiety and panic attacks.  I've done really well quitting so far.  In fact, up until now I've had major improvement in my acute panic attacks.  I was prescribed Xanax for them and it does help for a couple of hours.

I'll be sitting there, watching television and my mind isn't worried about anything and all of a sudden I feel a rush of dizziness.  It feels like I cannot focus and I look away.  If I lie down, the room spins.  It hits me out of nowhere several times a day.

I have drastically reduced caffeine.  My eating has increased so I wondered if it was a blood sugar thing or something.  I'm really at a loss and it's making me pretty miserable.  I honestly feel like I could pass out.  It makes me afraid to go for walks because I don't want to end up face down on the ground.

How long does this torture last?  I am so proud of myself for making it this far and I'm not about to cave at all, I'm just sooo tired of feeling like complete garbage.  On top of that. I never sleep longer than 5 hours in a night if I'm lucky.  My sleep is always very broken.

Things I've tried is increasing my water intake.  I drink around 90 ounces of water a day.  I've reduced caffeine.  I don't know what else to do.  I just want to sleep and be normal.

Thanks everyone for helping me get this far.

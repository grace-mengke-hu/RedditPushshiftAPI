I feel so crazy

So, I've already posted in here about how I felt crazy and full of rage after quitting smoking and I felt better reading other people's stories about how they feel crazy too.  But most people seem to stop feeling like that after a few days.  I'm on day 15 and I feel like I'm going crazy.  One minute I'm angry, like to the point where I have to stop myself from literally pulling my hair out or digging my nails into my flesh and then the next minute i'm crying.  I actually can barely cry, I want to so bad, but nothing comes out and it makes me even angrier.  My shower curtain fell off while I was showering and I tried to fix it, then ended up throwing it against the door and then trying to cry in the shower.  I took a shower because I was in the middle of my yoga practice and all this rage just overwhelmed me. The shower was supposed to calm me down.

The worst part about all of this is, is that since I'm 2 weeks in, I feel like maybe this isn't a side affect from quitting and I'm worried I'm ACTUALLY losing my damn mind.  Is there ANYONE else out there who feels this crazy for this long?  Please tell me this is from quitting smoking.

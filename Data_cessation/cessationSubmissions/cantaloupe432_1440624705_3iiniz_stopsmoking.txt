Recovered bulimic, 1 month quit, dealing with weight gain.

I've been in recovery from bulimia since the beginning of the year. I made the decision to be mentally and physically healthier, which included cigarettes. Once I felt confident with the control I now have over my ED, I quit smoking. Quitting is going extremely well, today is one month since quitting, this time it's going to stick!!

BUT, I'm having some issues with the weight gain. I've read that removing nicotine messes with digestion and causes bloat. I know it's different from person to person... but how long did it take for your weight to go back to normal? It's not much, just a few pounds. I'm not going to go back to smoking... it'll just be nice to see the weight go away.

EDIT: Thanks everyone! I really appreciate the kind words and insight to your own experiences. I'd rather gain a few pounds for a period of time than continue smoking... just trying not to make myself crazy and not focus on it too much. I probably should have said this earlier, but I made sure to let my therapist know this has been bothering me. So the professionals know! Thanks again, and I know all of you will continue to do well on your journey!

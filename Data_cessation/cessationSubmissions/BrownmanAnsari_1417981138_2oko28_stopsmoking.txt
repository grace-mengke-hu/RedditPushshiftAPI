Cigarette in my mouth

I have been off smoking for 5 days now. Fuck it seems like forever and yet they have just been 5 days. The last 4 days were absolutely fine. I kept myself busy. But today is hell. Have this unbelievable urge to just smoke one but I don't know how to stop. I've had a smoke in my mouth for the past hour, stopping myself from lighting it. Really would love for someone to take it out and break it in two.

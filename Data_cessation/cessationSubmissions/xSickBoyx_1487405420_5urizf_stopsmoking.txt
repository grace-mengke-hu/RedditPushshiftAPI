I want to quit but I can smoke everywhere

Currently in about 20-25 a day. I workout and generally live an otherwise healthy lifestyle trying to compensate for the damage Im doing to myself. 

I have a tech startup and have home offices. Second floor is my office and bedroom and downstairs is where my team works. Ever since I moved here I've been increasing my cigs. When at a corporate building or at my parent's house, I wasn't allowed to smoke, and that sort of kept me from abuse. But now, I can do it whenever I want and can't seem to be able to look back. 

I always have a sore throat, pretty sure I've developed sinusitis and post-nasal drip. I'm disgusted how my office smells all the time. It's been 12 years smoking and I know where to start.

The good feels.

It's pay-day today. I calculated what I would usually spend on cigarettes, and I re-directed it into an account which is now allocated for saving for my 20 month old sons University fund. 

It's incredible that, just by quitting smoking, when he turns nineteen, I will have saved $102,600.00 from smoking for him. I am going to be the *coolest* Mum ever! Especially since, in New Zealand, it isn't custom to save for University/College, as we all get student loans. 

**Mind fucking blown**. 

Keep going guys, this is totally worth it.

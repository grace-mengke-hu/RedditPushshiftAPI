please convince me to quit

ive tried to quit almost everyday for the past 2 months. every time i think i have a great reason, i dont give a shit about that reason when i quit because i just get incredibly up and down emotionally so it seems like the world is ending. i can quit for a few hours, up to 36 hours actually but then i give in because the pain is too much. please tell me what the fuck to do to quit once and for all. whats the right mindset. how do you take the pain and confusion and anxiety and fear and all the ups and downs.

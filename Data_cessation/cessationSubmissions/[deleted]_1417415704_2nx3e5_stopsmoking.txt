It's my birthday, and I'm a smoker

I've never classified myself as a smoker - it's strictly social or when I'm drinking, but I happen to drink quite a bit.  Honestly, I really enjoy the feeling of smoking, especially after a couple of beers.  I've always justified it because I don't really smoke 'that much'. I've pretty much justified it since I was 16, and now that I'm a bit older I started reflecting on it and the fact that I'm still doing it has made me want to stop.  So I have no idea the tone of this subreddit, but I'm admitting here that I do smoke and I want to stop, and I've had trouble in the past.  In fact, I promised my wife when we got married I would stop and it only lasted a few weeks.  So here's my pledge to myself, I really want to stop now.  What better day than my birthday.  What I'm asking here is how do I convince myself, as a pack or two a week smoker, that even in that amount that it will have long term affects?  How do I disconnect drinking and smoking?  By the way, my career is alcohol related and I'm big into craft beer, so stopping drinking to stop smoking isn't an option.

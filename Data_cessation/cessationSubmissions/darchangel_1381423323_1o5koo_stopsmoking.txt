Week 2 complete!

During each of my many quit smoking attempts, my hardest part was week #2. Week 1 has worse cravings, harder to concentrate, etc. but I'm so focused and dedicated that everything feels like a victory. Then week 2 comes. Maybe I'm tired of fighting so hard, maybe it's just that I get lazy and complacent, but week 2 has always been my hardest time.

I'm happy to say that week 2 is over! If I can get through this, I have no good excuse to undo all of my hard work by relapsing now.

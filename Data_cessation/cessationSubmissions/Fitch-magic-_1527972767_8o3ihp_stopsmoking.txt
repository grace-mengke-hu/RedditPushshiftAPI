Post 2. Relapses after 4 days and haven't stopped since

I've had Allen's book in pdf in my inbox for 5 years now and recently startes reading it. I have two more chapters to go.
An interesting reaction is that the book shook me. After reading in words what I've been thinking has made me feel like absolute shit. Like my mind is telling me that I am a drug addiction and that I'm ashamed of myself. I go into thoughts of what will my parents think of me! Is this how they have raised me? Is this how I raised myself? Note : I havent quit smoking yet 
I ask myself what went wrong in my life that I felt the need to self harm! I have no answers to that...coz nothing did. 

I started to write a note to self as to why I need to quit and the first reason was a Baby! I want to have a baby someday or at least be able to adopt one and a smoker gets none of that.

Still I'm sitting in a salon waiting for this pedicure to be over so I can smoke one.

TDLR: I'm a terrible person

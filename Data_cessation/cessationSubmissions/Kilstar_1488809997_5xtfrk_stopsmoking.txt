I did it, cold turkey, after ruining 2200 Days Smoke Free.

Hi All,

Never go "just one puff". 

Long time lurker. I started smoking when I was 16, a pack a day up. I gave up at 32 years old. It was hard as hell, but I managed. Zero cravings, I hated the smell after a few months of quitting.  

6 Years later,  the dumbass in me asked for a cigarette during my birthday party.  I almost vomited. But I was so drunk I smoked it anyway. Next day didn't think much about it. But it start like that. A few days later steal a cig from someone. Go to a vacation? Oh let's buy a pack. So after a few weeks of smoking that cig, I was smoking 2-3 a day, steadily, convinced I could keep it at that rhythm.  Boy was I wrong. 

2 Years later I was back at 15 cigarettes, and top of that, vaping 12mb juice between cigs. So I've no idea how much Nic I was putting in my system but that must be a lot.  Anyway, I stopped cold turkey after I got heavy smoker cough and couldn't stop spitting every 15 seconds while smoking one, also threw all my vapes in the garbage.  


The hardest part? I'm a drinker. Often go to after hours with colleagues, or if coming directly home from the office I like to have my drinks to blow off some steam. Anyway, I've had no choice but to lay off the hard stuff, and stick to a few light beers. But even with light beer, on the 2nd and 3rd day my brain just wanted to come out of my skull after a few drinks. So if you are not a drinker, don't drink booze those first few weeks.    

TL;DR: Ruined 2200 Smoke Free days by smoking one cigarette during my 38 years old birthday party. Was back to almost a pack a day after 2 years + vaping Nic juice between cigs on my 40 years old.  Stopped cold turkey 2 weeks ago, smoke free again. Still get cravings but easily manageable. 

Thanks all,  reading your stories inspired me to stop again.

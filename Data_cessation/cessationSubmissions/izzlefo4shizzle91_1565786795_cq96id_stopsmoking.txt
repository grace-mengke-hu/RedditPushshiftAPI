Keep putting off my quit date. HELP ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­

Everytime I think 'today is the day' I find myself just walking to the shop and buying cigs. I had the perfect mindset for quitting 2 years ago....quit 100% cold turkey for a year. Why can't I just get back into it!? Must have had about 100 quit attempts over the last 2 years and theyve only last 3 weeks max. Advice would be much appreciated on this!

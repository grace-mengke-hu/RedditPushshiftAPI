Vegetables and not gaining weight after my quit

It's going on my third day of not having a cigarette. I can already feel the urge to eat carbs and sweets increase. I am determined to stay in shape and not get fat.

Perhaps a new obsession is in order. Perhaps an obsession with eating clean and eat vegetables is a good replacement for my previous lethal habit.

If anyone has any suggestions on what route to take in order to do this successfully please feel free to share. 

Thanks

I hate who I am when I'm quitting

I have tried to quit many times before. I have been smoking for 20 years, and have regretted it for 20 years. I have had multiple chances to quit and always come back.

I hate who I am when I'm quitting. I'm angry and weepy and emotional. 
I watch people's hands when I'm out for a walk, to see if they're smoking, so I can bum one from them.
I step off the bus, I want a cigarette. I get to the stop with 5 minutes, ten minutes to spare, I want a cigarette while I wait.
I wake up, I want one. It's time for bed, I want one.

I have anxiety. When i have a panic attack, I need one. When i'm stressed, i need one.
I cut down to 2 cigs a day, now I've crept back up to 5 or so.

My kids are stressing me out? I want one, i justify it with "We need a time out, i'm going to step outside for 5 minutes."
I'm not getting along with my family? Same thing. "I'm gonna step outside for 5 minutes."
I hate how disappointed my boyfriend is in me. Everytime I have one, he sighs. We get into disagreements because I always disappoint him regarding my smoking.

I want to quit. I'm sick of being sick, of hurting, of being held hostage by this addiction.
I beat being an alcoholic.
I am bipolar. Quitting makes me want to self harm because I don't know how to cope with my emotions coming to a boiling point.

I want to quit. Again. For good.
I'm done. Just let me finish this pack.

Trying to quit again. Any good android apps?

I've seen one that was beautiful for iOS. It showed percentages of all sorts of things, like lung health and what not, so you could see your progress in more than just money saved. 

Is there an android equivalent? If not, can someone link to the iOS app I'm talking about and mayb eI'll make an android equivalent? Thanks!

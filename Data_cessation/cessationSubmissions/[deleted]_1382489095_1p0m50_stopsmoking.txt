So yeah, a little gross buuuut... Are nicotine poops a thing?

I'm on day 3 cold turkeh, gym gear at the ready so I can run and lift myself ragged after work and hopefully negate a lot of the uncomfortable sensations of the peak of physical symptoms I'm reading of. Going to slowly make my way through some cranberry juice to further aid with ridding my body of nicotine.

Now for the gross bit, and I'm sorry if anyone's eating... I just passed a fucking *huge,* almost black bowel movement. I'm wondering if this is a symptom of the detox? I've been eating well (mostly veg,) and trying to drink heaps of water... I just remembered that I ate a smallish block of vegan chocolate, 60% cocoa, last night so it may well be that.

Thanks once again :) Any tips or warnings on any further surprises in store over the next few days and weeks are welcomed!

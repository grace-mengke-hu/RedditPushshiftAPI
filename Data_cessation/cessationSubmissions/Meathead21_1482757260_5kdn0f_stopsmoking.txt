Day 3 starts today.

I'm 22 years old from northern Ontario, Canada. Smoking for about 5 years now, made it through 2 days without touching them which was a surprise yesterday with the drinking and family dinner. I just wanted to say if I can go 2 days without smoking so can anyone else. cheers to the New Years everyone I don't think I'm going to touch cigarettes again.

Day 2 - what's wrong?

I don't want to dwell on this too much since I'm basically trying to keep myself distracted. I had tapered down my smoking to 3 full cigs smoked a couple puffs at a time throughout the day. Then I slept in and decided "Well I've already made it through half a day.." and just haven't since. I think about it a lot, find my thoughts drifting to it sounding like a good idea or that I'll probably break tomorrow under the stress of work so why torture myself now? But then I recognize the thought and try to think about why I want to quit. I've substituted some cinnamon candy (heat) and wintergreen mints (I smoked menthols) to preoccupy during cravings, and driving is especially worse. I keep reading about the first 3 days being the worse, with up to 2 weeks, anything I should know going in tomorrow, or just keep doing what I'm doing? This seems easier than it should and I'm concerned I'll be blind sided. Or maybe I'm just finally ready?

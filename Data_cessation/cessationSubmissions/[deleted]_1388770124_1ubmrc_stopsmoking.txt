Quitting. Again. This time for good.

I know my flair is a little off. I tried quitting in spring last year and failed. 

In October I started a keto diet and quit drinking. I'm getting healthier every day and I love it. I'm seeing the weight drop. And the best part? I don't miss the alcohol. So I figure, if I can quit drinking - maybe I can finally quit smoking as well. I really want to get better at biking and running and hopefully do a tough mudder this year. 

So goodbye, smoking. I will not miss you or the way you make me feel or how much you cost.

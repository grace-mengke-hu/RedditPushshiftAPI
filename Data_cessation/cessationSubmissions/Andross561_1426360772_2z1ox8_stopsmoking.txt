Had an idea... might have been mentioned here already but here goes...

I decided to open a new savings account and for each day I don't smoke put 13 dollars in that account (packs are an average of 13 dollars in nyc). This way I can see how much money I've saved by not smoking. Alternatively if I were to break (I have no intention of doing so) I would use this money to buy packs and watch all the money saved up dwindle away. Just some encouragement for me to stay smoke free. I have 78 dollars so far!! :)

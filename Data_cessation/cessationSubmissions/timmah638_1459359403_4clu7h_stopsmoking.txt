It's amazing what a terrible cold can do for you.

Over the past week, I've been miserable - stuffy nose, inflamed sinuses, coughing crap up - and it got to the point where I couldn't smoke without struggling to breathe. So I stopped. No cigarette is worth that sheer physical discomfort and pain. 

Four days later, the cold has just about passed and I was too miserable during it to notice any major early withdrawal symptoms. Kinda funny how that works out.

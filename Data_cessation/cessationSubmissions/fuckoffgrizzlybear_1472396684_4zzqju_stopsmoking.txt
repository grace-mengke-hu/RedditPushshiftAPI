End game is one or a week. Should I stop totally for a period then reintroduce?

I'm hoping to get to having one or smoke a week, on Sunday evenings. Today will be my 6th day smoke free, and it is Sunday. I'm wondering if anyone has any tips whether having a single smoke this evening, will throw me back into a spiral. Ie is it better to wait until I've gone say a month or two without at a smoke and then start having a smoke on Sunday evenings.

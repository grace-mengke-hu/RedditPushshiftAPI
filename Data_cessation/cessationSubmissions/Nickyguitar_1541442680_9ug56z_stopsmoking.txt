Had a weak moment and am mega annoyed

Hi folks. I just felt I needed to confess after being smoke free for 25 days, I went out with mates for a drink and got a bit drunk and had a few ciggies. So cross with myself. Does anyone have experiences similar where they stayed strong? How did you manage that. I am very weak-willed it seems :-(

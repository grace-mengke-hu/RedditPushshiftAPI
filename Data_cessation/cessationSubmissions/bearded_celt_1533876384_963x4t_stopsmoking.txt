I smoked one cigarette

Hey guys,

This is more of post to shit on myself than anything. I've been a half a pack a day smoker for around 4 years. Ive tried to quit a few times before and I've used patches and gum and other stuff and it's never worked. On Sunday I decided I was done and going cold turkey. 

I went 4 days without nicotine and jt was easier than any time id tried to quit vefore. I think it was just because of my mentality when I started, I really wanted to quit instead of just feeling like I should 

Then came tonight. I was out for beers with friends and I convinced myself I'd be cool to just have one. Even though I knew it's rarely ever just one.

Thing is, I bought a pack and smoked one. It killed my cravings but I didn't feel good. It tasted disgusting and I am disgusted with myself for my lack of self control. It almost makes me glad I did because I realised I dont want to be someone who just has one every now and again, I never want to smoke again. It's just fucking awful. 

I'm just so disappointed with myself at pissing away 4 days of will power and discomfort for 5 minutes of disappointment. 

I guess I just wanted to write this to say even if it is just one cigarette, it's not worth it. Its gross and it makes you feel like shit and it's not worth it. I know now that I'll never give in again because it's simply not worth it. There is no upside.

Sorry for the long rambling post. I just needed to chastise myself for smoking. Stay strong folks.

[45 Days] Looking for some advice

I'm at 45 days today, halfway to one of my milestones. I'm curious though, you don't hear much about people's experiences after the first couple months of quitting. I'd like to hear experiences and the benefits noticed during the second or third month and on. I'm not really sure what to expect right now. Things are okay one day, the next I get some moderate cravings, then no sleep, and suddenly I sleep like a baby the next. Thanks!

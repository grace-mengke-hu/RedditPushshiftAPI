Going to a party, hoping to end it there.

I've always just hated the fact that I smoke since I started. My sister and I hounded my parents for years to quit and now we both do. She got into it after a car accident that made her sober up (despite my hypocritical attempts to make her not) and I've just always ended up around smokers so I never had a chance to get away from the bad bumming habit I made.  

But I met this girl, and I finally feel the willpower to go for something again. I know it seems silly but I've always been a weak-willed, doubtful person with a desire to change that. It's time, gents. Killing this pack with some friends, and swear them to hit me if they catch me with one. If this confidence boost pays off, I'm gonna need to have good-smelling breath, a shiny smile, and good stamina ;)

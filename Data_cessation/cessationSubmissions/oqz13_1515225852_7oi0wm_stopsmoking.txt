Nicotine-free in 2018

I've not had a cigarette since the new year - five whole days! I've smoked on and off since I was 15/16, and I'm now 30 so it feels great to be slowly breaking this habit of a lifetime.  

I wanted to share a couple of things that I've found really helpful in my efforts to give up... 1) mindfulness. more and more, studies show that meditation can really help in overcoming addiction. i use the headspace app - it really helps to keep up the resolve. 2) the principle of 'just for today'. i'm in a 12-step programme for substance misuse and the idea of just making it through today was key in helping me clean up there. basically, every day, make it your absolute top priority to get your head on the pillow at the end of it without having smoked a cigarette. nothing else matters, and if you achieve this it is a great day! and then get up in the morning and do the same again. so often, we can be defeated by our worries of 'I won't possibly be able to get through this or that occasion without a cigarette, so why bother..?' Just for today does away with all this worry - we'll cross those bridges if and when we come to them. 

Really good luck all. It's a tough journey but it's so worth it!

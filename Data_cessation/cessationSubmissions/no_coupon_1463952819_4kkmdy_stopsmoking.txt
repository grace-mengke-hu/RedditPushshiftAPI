How Long Is This Gonna Last?

So I'm not quitting smoking but vaping. I'm on day 4 and am going strong... however, I was not very pleased when I woke up this morning. I have Diarrhea and Constipation some how. Cramping, headache, hacking cough, dizzy spells and tightness in my chest. The weird part is though that I don't really have an urge to smoke. I have a final examinations starting next week.... How long are these symptoms going to last for? I feel like I'm in it now and If I can get over this hump I'll finally be free of the ball and chain forever, I've come so far from cigarettes to vaping and now to this I just want to be rid of it.... BUT I FEEL AWFUL! Has anyone had a similar experience to this? Anything would help right now to keep me going strong. maybe words of advice or lie to me and tell me that I'm gonna wake up tomorrow and feel right as rain.

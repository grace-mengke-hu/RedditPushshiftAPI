Hey guys! This is my 44th day and i still get cravings when I drink...

In fact a drinking night just ended with my friends. I didn't smoke but I had some serious cravings. I just kept thinking that I will regret it tomorrow, and I do not want to start the whole thing again, but still this is not my first night out since I quit, and I always have pretty heavy cravings, because all of my friends are smoking. 44 days in and I still think i enjoyed smoking, I know this is just the addiction speaking but honestly I think it makes the parties better. Will these cravings eventually pass? I feel kinda bad right now..

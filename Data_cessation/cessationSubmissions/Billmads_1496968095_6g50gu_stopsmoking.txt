Short Version On How I Quit Smoking

Hello, Its Billmads Aka Jordan

I was a smoker for 10 years, tried all the quit smoking aids. Except one ( ecigs ). The first time ever trying ecigs was able to quit smoking first time, now that being said truly believe ecigs contributed 75% of me quitting. The rest was pure determination, discipline and willpower.

The ecig helped me with my tobacco withdrawals, you don't just get negative effects from nicotine. I found that not only was i dependant on nicotine in the cigarette was also addicted to other chemicals in the cigarette as well. 

People say you trading an addiction for another, that is pure speculation. I in fact found it easy to quit just nicotine after i've purge my body of all the other toxins that accompanied tobacco. I eventually didn't didn't even use nicotine in my ejuice and was vaping for fun for a couple months.

I now don't even vape anymore and don't smoke cigarettes 2 years tobacco free :)

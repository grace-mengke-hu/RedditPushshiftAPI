Moving forward, with a plan.

After countless attempts to quit smoking for good over the past 2-3 years, I finally found the correct solution **for me**.

I tried using the "Fifty-One" starter kit from a mall, a typical rechargable analog look-a-like.

It sucked...after a week it tasted like a burnt log and I started back on cigarettes.

I recently invested in an eGo Electronic cigarette with a clearomizer tank and the sensation of the vapor is exactly like a cigarette for me now.

I haven't even thought about buying a pack, and this new hobby of mine is saving my life.

TLDR: New eGo e-cig is making the quitting period less dreadful.

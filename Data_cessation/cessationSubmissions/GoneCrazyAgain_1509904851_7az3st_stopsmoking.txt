Day 5 - At least I haven't smoked.

Today is day 5. Having used Allen Carr's Easyway method, I am feeling confident about being a nonsmoker. Unfortunately, this seems like one of the few positives in my life right now. I have been having issues in my relationship for some time. After becoming very intoxicated Friday evening, I voiced the many things that have been eating away at me in a not-so-subtle way. Although I love him, this relationship has long caused me much more grief than happiness. Feeling quite depressed about the whole situation. I am proud of myself for not smoking though. Not while I was intoxicated. Not while ending a two year relationship with the only person I have ever loved. I guess this is the bright side.

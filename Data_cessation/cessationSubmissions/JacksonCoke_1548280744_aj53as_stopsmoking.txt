One week free. Looking for advice on lung recovery.

I've never been a very heavy smoker, but it finally caught up with me. The day I realized I was having trouble consistently drawing a full, deep, breath was the day I quit cold turkey. Now that I'm past the one week mark, I'm done with cravings, but I'm still having trouble with deep breaths.     
      
I've been drinking Traditional Medicinals Breathe Easy tea, and I've ordered some mullein and lungwort as well. Are there any other products I should be aware of, or breathing exercises, or I don't know what else, that can help my lungs get back on track?    
    
Thanks in advance!

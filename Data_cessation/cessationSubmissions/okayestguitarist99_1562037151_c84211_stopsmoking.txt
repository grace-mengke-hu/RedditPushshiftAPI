My birthday present to myself

Today was my twentieth birthday. I've been on and off nicotine since i was 15, and addicted  consistently for almost 3 years. Several things have gone right in the past few months. I started dating an amazing girl who i see a real future with, i found out I'll be graduating with my bachelors this coming May (a full year early), i finally figured out what i wanna do with my life and made a five year plan, i had everything set up to be a fully functioning adult. Except for one thing.

I was still hooked. I stopped smoking cigs back in November, but I've been vaping like crazy this entire time. But i decided that enough was enough. I didn't want to take this into my twenties. So now I'm approaching my first full 24 hours clean in somewhere between 18-24 months. Tbh I just wanted to tell someone else about it. Keep up the good work lads. Never going back.

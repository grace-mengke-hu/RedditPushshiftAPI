I quit 1.5 years ago

And it has been one hell of a week. I broke up with my boyfriend, had a public and humiliating meltdown at work, my apartment is a mess, a higher than normal percentage of customers Ive dealt with have been dumb or assholes or both. I feel generally anxious and low and unmotivated. Every step of the way this week I have wanted a cigarette. 

I will not smoke, but fuck this week has been hard. It's hands down the most challenging time I've had in the last year and a half.

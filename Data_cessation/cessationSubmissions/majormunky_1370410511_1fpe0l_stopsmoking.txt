Just finished reading the easy way to stop smoking, and had my last cigarette!

I've been a smoker for what.. almost 20 years now, last year I tried e-cigarettes, but, nothing so far has helped.  The past few days I was looking into getting another e-cig, but, realized I would rather just not smoke or intake any nicotine.  Finished the easy way to quit smoking book in an afternoon, and I feel pretty confident that I can tackle this.  Its time to kill that little demon.. =)

I have relapsed so many times and it paid off... 34 days smoke free COLD TURKEY..

So 9 years of smoking, gradually got worse every year. But I never stopped quitting. Every time I relapsed it got worse making the number of cigarettes increase per day. So many times I relapsed for so many reasons. Practically I have relapsed for every reason that a relapse could occur. For STRESS (innumerable times), if I hear a good news(every time), cravings( so many times), boredom, thinking that I would smoke one more pack and quit. You name it and I have relapsed. I tried vaping, gums, will power, everything. 
    One thing that worked for me is cold turkey. Knowledge about relapses(from my own experiences). Cigarette won’t help in stress, it won’t make ur celebrations better, it won’t make u look cool(in fact it makes u smell and look shitty), find something healthy and productive if u r bored. And finally there is no one cigarette or one puff no matter in what situation u are...

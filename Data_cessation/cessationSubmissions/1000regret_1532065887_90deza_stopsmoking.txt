I am ready to quit this nasty habit once and for all

I started smoking about 14 years ago. My first ex gf was the reason that got me into smoking cigs. I dont even wanna count how much money I have spent on cigs ever since then, probably more than enough for a nice decent car but then after i broke up with her, I was smoke free til I met my most recent ex gf, she got me smoking again and I couldnt be more happier that I broke up with her, now I felt like I am totally ready to kick this nasty habit even if I was to meet a new girl that smoke cigs daily, I would want no part of it and I am gonna be smoke free til the day I die.

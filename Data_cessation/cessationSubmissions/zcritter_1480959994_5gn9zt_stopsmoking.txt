Badge reset. Feeling defeated.

Reset my badge today after quite a few months of denial.  I was the gal that quit smoking and smoker boyfriend moved in, and was like raging pissed about it. Well, y'all can all guess how that worked out. 

He leaves to go back to his country in 5 days.  Was super hungover yesterday and didn't smoke, so jumping back on the fresh air train.  We haven't broken up but the idea is for me to move back there in a few months time.  However if he doesn't quit I might have a bigger issue with this.

Feeling down and weak and really just want to quit this forever.  Wah. Pity party.

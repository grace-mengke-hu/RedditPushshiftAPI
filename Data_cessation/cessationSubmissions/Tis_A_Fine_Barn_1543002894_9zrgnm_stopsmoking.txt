I dedicate my smoke-free day today to retail workers who are quitting smoking. Retail is unforgiving and smoke breaks are few and treasured to get away for a while. Double-fold during Black Friday and other holidays. Stay strong. Quitting is the right choice! Presenting #022 Fearow. See you Monday.

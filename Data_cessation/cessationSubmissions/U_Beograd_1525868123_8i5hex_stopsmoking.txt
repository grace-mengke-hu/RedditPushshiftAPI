It's more of a physiological need than a physical need

I'm on day 3 and have had my cravings but what I've realised is I crave more to scenario and setting rather than actually 'needing' one. E.g. With coffee in the morning, just got back from work, after eating a meal. It's not that I feel I need it, it's that I've programmed my brain to have a cigarette at specific times and if I don't have one that's when I have to fight off the craving and get out of the pattern.

I hope to never go back to smoking again and this sub has really helped me so thank you to all the people who are involved in this subreddit.

12 days and counting

I was never a heavy smoker but I had to have a smoke after particular triggers like after meals, before bed, etc. Decided to quit after a friend who was also like me had a heart attack. 

There is no better feeling than to pass all the cig shops on my way to see my badge grow by one more day. Still have a long way to go, but thank you /r/stopsmoking .

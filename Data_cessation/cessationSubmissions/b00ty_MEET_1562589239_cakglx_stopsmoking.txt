Help me quit please!

Started lifting a few of my parents cigs when I was 13-14, been smoking something ever since. Hid it through high school successfully, from coaches and girlfriends. Eventually went to a vape in college, back to cigs, and then to Juul. It seems like I can’t escape nicotine. I threw my Juul away about a week ago and it took me two days before I bought another pack of cigs. Please, those of you who have stopped, can you tell me what’s made it easier for you? I want to stay away from patches and all that if possible. I think I just need a good distraction. TIA

Small relapse after 9 days smoke free

I’ve been smoke free and nicotine free for 9 days, 14 hours. This morning I relapsed and chewed half a 2mg nicotine gum. I spat it out quickly. Sometimes I want to swallow something poisonous just to feel that awful sensation in my throat that smoking gives. 

My brain is trying all sorts of things like “but what’s the point? Not like it makes a difference to smoke anyway”.

Bar Test

I'm on 4d18h36m....so about 5 days...

After a pretty easy week(barring the hunger and craving pangs) - tonight I'm going for drinks with coworkers.  I've had a few drinks this week at home and  yeah they are a bit triggering - but I'm doing this tonight to set a milestone for myself that if ever I feel I can't cope - I can remind myself that I was able to drink in a bar on my first week of quitting.  Sure its playing with fire - but I think I need to do this for me.

Don't wish me luck.  I will succeed.

15 years a smoker... my new wife has asthma

I turn 31 in August and I (hopefully) had my last cigarette this AM with my caffeine. My new and beautiful and amazing wife has asthma, which is triggered when I forget to wash my hands, face, and brush my teeth before getting into bed with her. 

I've smoked on and off since I was 15, 14... I honestly don't know when I 'started'. Any help convincing me not to go and buy a pack of Camel Turkish Golds... that delicious tobacco? I know that sex, and self sex, and gum, and alcohol, and other things I won't mention here can help, but I'm really having a hard time right now. 

Literally the week that we got married I got fired from my job... and she got laid off last Friday. Any words of encouragement are appreciated. Thanks in advance! :D

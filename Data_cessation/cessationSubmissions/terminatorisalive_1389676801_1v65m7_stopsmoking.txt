Quitting smoking was easy compared...

To quitting porn, But quitting both together was the way to go. It's like quit one quit another one free!

Not to say that's it's easy for everyone....but it was for me. 

I guess if you have other addictions I would suggest eliminating all of them at once if you can. Fight them Cold turkey with a little research and education as your sword.
Good day:)

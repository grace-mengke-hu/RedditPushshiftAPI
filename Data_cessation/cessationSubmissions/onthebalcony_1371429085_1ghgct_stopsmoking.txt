Starting my journey

Getting married in exactly two months. SO, a non-smoker, says he will say no at the altar if I don't quit. I quit cold turkey when I met him six years ago after having smoked since 17, held it up for three years, and started again because (insert silly excuses). I smoke 20 a day, more if drinking. I'm 27, and my lungs and my budget hate me. I'm a nurse, specialised in pulmonary medicine at that, and I know all the excuses - even the ones that make COPD patients leave their oxygen masks to smoke. *I know*. But I'm still almost in tears at the thought of dumping my friend, my relief, my breaktime, my only remaining bit of teenage rebellion and non-conformity. 

I've been lurking here for a while in preparation, and it seems like a great place for support. I've tried the books and the supplements, to no avail - cold turkey is the way forward. But... please help?

I'm ashamed of myself, but I swear I'm trying

I was smoking a pack and a half a day. Then last Sunday I found out I was pregnant. I immediately started cutting down in an effort to slowly quit. I set a timer and when it goes off I'm permitted to smoke if I feel I need to. Today I'm up to smoking every 1.5 hours and about a half a pack a day but I'm going insane. I'm chugging water to fight cravings, I'm chewing gum, I'm munching on healthy snacks, I'm even deep cleaning my house to try to keep my mind busy!!! But I'm getting fidgety and start to go into an almost rage every hour.

I essentially self medicated with cigarettes. They really helped my depression, anxiety and anger issues. I am currently in therapy for all of that, but right now my therapist is on vacation and I'm fucked for any help for the next two weeks. I was going to be getting medication for anxiety and depression as well but that's out the window. Although I'm very excited about my pregnancy I'm downright PISSED that I have to quit smoking. I'm very aware of the health issues that it will cause my unborn baby and myself. But those are already what I'm using to motivate myself and lately it's not enough.

Please for the love of god don't shame me. I know I'm a horrible person for still smoking and the health risks not being enough for me to just quit. So anything awful you have to say please know I agree with you and I would prefer if this thread could avoid things like that that we already know.

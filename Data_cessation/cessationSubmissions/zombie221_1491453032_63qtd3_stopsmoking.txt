Oral nicotine for smoking cessation?

So, i know you can take nicotine orally in the form of mints or gum in order to aid in quitting smoking.
I found some cheap nicotine solution. Could I orally ingest the equivalent of liquid equivalent of 5-7mg in place of other smoking cessation products, or is there something i am missing? It's significantly cheaper to buy the nicotine PG or VG solution.

that's 25000 mg of nicotine for $31? Compared to way more than that for the gum/lozenges/patches
I have the proper equipment to measure small amounts of liquid and I could dilute it if consuming it undiluted would cause some kidn of problem.
I've done some googling and I havent really found much information about this

edit: I've read about some people putting the nicotine PG solution on their skin for a transdermal ROI?

Could really use some advice :(

Hey Guys,

First post in this subreddit. I started smoking when I was 17 as I'm sure you all know it's been a constant struggle of quitting and failing all the way until now, and I'm almost 23. The longest I've managed to quit is 3 months. (Found a pack on the ground, with a lighter in it. Failed) Its been almost a year since then. I'm on the final stretch of getting my degree and it's stress mania. Most of the time when I quit I almost always fail when finals roll around.

I recently quit smoking weed (5 days quit) and since then my tobacco intake has increased. And recently, with a clear mind I've been feeling more and more like shit about smoking.

My plan is to quit smoking after finals, but am I just rationalizing with myself? Should I wake up and quit tomorrow? Is giving myself some time to finish quitting weed for good a smart idea? Some friends of mine recommended Allen Carr's book (which almost seems to good to be true?) Spring break is actually at the end of this week and i'm taking a 6 day trip to the mountains for some snowboarding. Should I take the time away as a blessing and quit now? I'm just afraid that I will return home, and the stress of school and finals will break me.

So many questions, I just feel so lost. Everyday I'm filled with the fear that I will smoke my entire life. That I will end up like my grandfather and die of emphysema. I'm tired of living in fear, and feeling like shit. I'm a lost soul in need of advice...

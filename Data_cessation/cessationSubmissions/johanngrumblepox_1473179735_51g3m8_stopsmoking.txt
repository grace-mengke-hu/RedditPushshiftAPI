late day 7 update.

Okay, I missed my day 7 update because I was traveling, and then came home early because I got sick.  But I'm on day 10 and I wish I could say it's gotten easier.  I spent the first two days of my trip with an old friend who is going through a hard time and he started smoking again.

I spent 3 days at a work conference in a tropical location getting ready for (and giving) a huge presentation.  I had to leave that city early because I got strep.  So I missed a trip to the waterfalls and a rock climbing trip because I got sick.  

I'm hanging in there, but feeling like getting sick was my fault - for years of smoking, for hanging out with my friend while he chainsmoked, for staying up too late, for still coughing up bullshit from my own smoking. 

So I'm home, back at work - and in the office.  This is my first day back in the office since I quit so I'm going to take it one hour at a time, and stay away from my smoking coworkers. 

Funny/weird/terrible? how I racked up 80 days of alcohol sobriety without as much effort as 10 minutes of nicotine sobriety.

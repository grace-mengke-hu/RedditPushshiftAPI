Thoughts on my one-month anniversary

My last cigarette was on March 23rd, so tomorrow is the one-month anniversary of my quit date. Man, what a long, strange trip it's been. I thought I'd take a bit tonight and offer up my thoughts on the last month.

I smoked for 28 years and quit so many times that I wouldn't even want to try to count them. I had pretty much resigned myself to the fact that I was never going to be free of cigarettes. About a year ago, my brain started changing though. I started to look at cigarettes and ask myself why I was smoking it. I started to realize that I didn't like the taste anymore. I definitely didn't get a buzz off of the cigarettes, and they never seemed to do anything for me. I realized that smoking was only doing two things for me. First, it was keeping me from suffering through withdrawal, and second, it was keeping me addicted. I started to shift my thinking. I realized that I wasn't a smoker, I was an addict. I was the same as an alcoholic or drug addict. I realized that I needed to treat my addiction to nicotine the same way every other drug addict is treated.

In my many previous quits, I had tried pretty much every NRT method known to man. I had used the patch, gum, and lozenges. I had decided to turn to modern medicine and talk to my doctor about a prescription drug to help me get off of cigarettes. The thing is though, I hate taking drugs. Yes, I was addicted to nicotine, but I haven't had more than a drink every now and then in years. Other than 3 experiments with weed about 20 years ago, I have never used illegal drugs. I don't even take aspirin if I can avoid it. I believe in the body's ability to heal itself. and think that we should let it do its job as much as possible. Basically, I **really** detested the idea of taking a pharmaceutical to quit, but I was getting desperate.

Before I go any further, let me side-track for a second and say that I am not a judgemental person. I don't care if you smoke weed, it just isn't for me. I definitely don't think any less of people who use Chantix or Wellbutrin to quit, it just isn't the route I wanted to go.

Back to my story. A guy that works for me vaped, so I started looking into it. I realized that, even though it wouldn't get me off of nicotine, it would be better for me than smoking. I decided that I would try vaping as a method of smoking cessation first, then after that failed I could truly say that I had tried everything and I would go into the doctor and get the prescription.

I started off with a juice with 9mg of nicotine in it. The shop here in town told me that was the most they could give me. I don't know that it was true since I've heard of people vaping with 50-60mg juice, but I didn't really know anything about vaping, so I went with it. I had my last cigarette on Friday night before going to bed, then made an agreement with myself that I would never smoke another cigarette in my life. Notice that I did not set the bar at never using nicotine again, I simply barred tobacco from my life. I think this might be part of my success this time, but I'll get to that later.

I spent the first two weeks vaping on 9mg juice. I was definitely into full-blown withdrawals. For the first few days, that 9mg juice was most definitely **not** replacing the nicotine that I had been receiving, but that was sort of the point. I was trying to wean myself off of nicotine, so I needed to be in withdrawal. The point of the vape was to keep me functional while I detoxed, and I found that it did that. Yes, I was experiencing narcolepsy and fog-brain, but I was able to muddle through the day. I also found that, because of the vape, it really wasn't hard for me to stay off of tobacco. 

By the end of week 2, I was starting to feel normal while using the 9mg juice, so I went to the vape shop and bought some 6mg juice. I used that for a week, but I found my body adjusted to it within a couple of days, so I got ballsy and went to 3mg juice for week 4. I have now been on the 3mg juice for a few days and I'm feeling pretty stable, so I'm ready to move into the final phase. Bear with me, I'm making this up as I go along.

Here's my plan for the coming weeks. I already have some 0mg juice for my vaporizer, and I'm loading that tonight. I have a smaller vaporizer that I started with, so I'll load that one up with the 3mg juice as a safety net. I also went to Wally World today and bought some nicotine lozenges. Starting tomorrow, I am going to go to work with both vaporizers and the lozenges. I am going to stay off of everything as long as possible. If the nicotine withdrawals get too bad, I will go for the lozenges first. If the lozenges don't appear to be working and I believe that I'm going to crack, I will allow myself to use the 0mg vape and see if it's a mental thing that I'm missing. As a last resort, if I have to, I will pull out the vaporizer with the 3mg juice in it and go back to using that.

Yes, I should just put it all down and go from there without a safety net, but I'm afraid. I have gone through so much to give up tobacco, and I refuse to go back onto it. No, vaping isn't good for me, but it's better than tobacco. I know myself, and if things get really bad tomorrow, I will go to the corner store and buy a pack if I don't have another option. Here's hoping that I can push myself through tomorrow completely clean, but I will not go back to smoking.

Hopefully, this post isn't too "stream of consciousness", but I felt like I needed to get it out now. YMMV, but the methods that I have used appear to be working for me so far. I am tobacco free for a month, and prior to this, the 6-weeks I spent in basic training was the longest time I've been without it since I was about 15. No, I'm not nicotine free... yet... but in my eyes, what I have accomplished so far is nothing short of a miracle.

This brings me to thoughts on what has made this quit different than previous quits. Here are the things that I think have made a difference.

* I quit on a Friday with Monday and Tuesday off from work. I essentially slept through that 4-day weekend. This allowed my body an adjustment period to kickstart the process. If I had it to do over again, I would probably take a week off from work and go cold turkey, allowing myself to sleep through the entire week and adjust before going back to work.

* Vaping really helped. It allowed me to keep my mental habit while focusing on reducing my nicotine dependence. In the past, I found that patches were far too passive, and gum and lozenges just didn't do enough to take the edge off and keep me going. I needed a win to get me going, and vaping provided that. I got the win of getting rid of tobacco from my life to help get my confidence up.

* This is a really important one... I subscribed to this subreddit and threw myself completely into it. Talking to others who are going through the same thing, and sharing what has worked and what has not, has really helped. Essentially, this sub has become my version of an AA or NA meeting. Remember, I told you that I started looking at myself as a drug addict and not as a smoker.

* To build off of the last bullet point, someone on this sub posted a link to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeRhOsUGM54&amp;t=9s&amp;index=2&amp;list=WL) YouTube video. It is based on Allen Carr's book. As I watched the video for the first time, I realized that it was teaching people to view smoking the way I had begun to view it. It was teaching people to view it as a completely and utterly useless waste of time. Even though I was already thinking that way, hearing someone else say it to me helped to cement it in my mind. The video also filled in some gaps in my thinking. The video definitely helped me a lot, and I've watched it a few times over the last few weeks. I may have it on a loop tomorrow.

* I told people that I quit smoking. After being a failure at quitting so many times before, I had started to not tell people that I was quitting so that I could avoid having to tell them that I failed again. This time, I let people know that I was quitting. No, I didn't say anything going into that 4-day weekend, but because I had survived that 4-day weekend and felt pretty confident, I had no issues telling people once I got back to work on Monday.

Alright, this has turned into a novel, and I do apologize, but my mind really is racing a million miles a minute right now. I am so completely amazed that I have made it this far. Hopefully, something I've said in this post will help someone else make it through their quit.

Here's to tomorrow. We've all got this, and we can do it!

Everything is so clear (day 4)

I didn't realize how easy this could be. The first couple days of detoxing from nicotine were absolute hell, but now I feel back to normal. I love being able to focus on what I'm doing, instead of constantly rushing through everything so I could have my next smoke. I can also TASTE and SMELL things again. I legit didn't notice how badly my senses were dulled. I sleep better, smell better, I'm more relaxed. Literally everything is better. It's insane.

I'm also pretty proud of myself because I've been hanging out around smokers but haven't even wanted a cigarette. The way I see it is...why put myself through the hell of quitting just so I can live in pain lusting after cigarettes??? No way. I respect myself more than that. They're gross and I'm over it.

Anybody who is struggling during those first few days...remember...it gets better! Purge the nicotine demon from your body, that thing sucks. Get it over with and you'll be so proud of yourself.

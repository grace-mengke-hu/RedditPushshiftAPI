Deciding to quit.

Hey guys.
I've been smoking for 7 years now at around 40-50 a day. It's caught up to me in all the horrible ways.
I've decided I'm going to begin quitting once I wake up.
I would love some tips for the morning as the routine is generally coffee, smoke and repeat.
Any advice at all is welcome and il update my progress here throughout the day.
Thanks :)

My mom has severe COPD

I had to take my mom to the ER this morning she couldn't breathe. She smoked for 30 years about three/four packs a day. She quit in 1998. Whenever she gets a cold/ sinus infection  her COPD flares up. She will be in there for at least 5 days on strong steroids and antibiotics. It is crazy that I see her suffer with breathing and I still have the urge to smoke. I will not smoke today :) I hope this helps someone

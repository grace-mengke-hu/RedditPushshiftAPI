Bad day..

I haven't really craved a cigarette since the first week of quitting but today has been really hard. I'm a stay at home mom and my husband has narcolepsy and I take on everything at home by myself and I've been really overwhelmed the past few days, with both kids being sick and my husband working late and then going out with his friends. I don't think I want a cigarette but I am craving my smoking ritual. It gave me 10 minutes away from the kids. 10 minutes of quiet. 10 minutes of being by myself. It's not bad like this all the time but both kids have been especially... Challenging... Today lol

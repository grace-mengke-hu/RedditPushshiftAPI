If you breathe someone's e-cig vapor, can this impede your recovery from nicotine addiction?

I had a client at work yesterday and he smoked his e-cig all day, puffing the vapor around (no openable windows). Although it didn't seem to affect me particularly except for a vicious headache at the end of the day, I wondered if that meant I inhaled nicotine? Could that have strengthen the cravings?

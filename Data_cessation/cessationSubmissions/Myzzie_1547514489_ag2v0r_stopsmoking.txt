Tonight I dreamt I smoked

I remember, I looked down the pack and saw half gone. I told myself.

 -"shit, I've been smoking, but it's okay. If I just stop now and don't smoke anymore, everything will be fine." 

When I woke up, I thought about this with a bit nervous feeling. As if I thought I actually had been smoking. So yeah, I'm beating this shit even in my dreams now. Win win!

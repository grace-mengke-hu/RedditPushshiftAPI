1000 Days!

When I was 19, I used a bad breakup as a poor excuse to fall into a bad and expensive habit. I immediately regretted it, but the addiction sank its hooks in fast. I smoked for ten years, trying to quit at least a dozen times, but always finding an excuse to jump back in. New Years 2016, I put down my last cigarette. I began working out, picked up several new hobbies... did whatever I could do to keep me from relapsing and today makes the one thousandth day I've gone without a cigarette. I can say to any of you who are in their first few hours/days/weeks into quitting that it DOES get easier. It is worth it, and you CAN absolutely tackle this challenge because if I can do it, anyone can!

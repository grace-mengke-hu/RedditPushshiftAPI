So I was told to visit over here.

I was told that this is the place to go if you are trying to quit.  I am currently on day 2 , and have a hard time thinking of going months without.  I no longer have a job, but I get money from government since Im a vet, and want to get my wife something nice for v-day.  Hoping to use the money im saving from buying cigs so that I can get her gift, but its not as easy as I thought it would be.

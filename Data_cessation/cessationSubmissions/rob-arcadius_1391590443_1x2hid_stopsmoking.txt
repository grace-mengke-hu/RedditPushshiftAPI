Ignore my badge I'm a fucking failure and when I finally see it after posting this I might just cry.

I never actually quit, I think I made it two or so weeks before I fucked up and started again. I'm having a terrible urge right now but I don't have anything to smoke so I'm safe there. I'm quitting. I have to. My lungs hurt. I want to sing but I can't hold a note long enough. I want my teeth to stop yellowing and I want my breathe to not smell like complete shit. I want to smell again. I want to know I'm not just a smoker, anymore. I want to be able to go to Wawa and not spend four times as much as I want to while picking up a drink. I want to survive long enough to bury my father. I want to be free of this slavery to ash. I want to be able to drink a beer without instantly reaching for my 27's for a puff. I want to encourage my best friend's gf to quit with me. I want to be way better then I have been. I want to save up money. I want to go back to college. I want to date girls. I want to buy a car. I want to buy a computer. I want to get my own place. I want to grow up. I want to be free. I want to be healthy. I want to be stronger. Stronger than this. Better than this. I'm not resetting my badge because it doesn't actually help me. I want to feel shitty every time I see it, knowing I fucked up and lied to all of you. Lied to myself. To my friends, my family, the internet. The truth is is that I haven't enjoyed a cigarette in years and I hate that I let the addiction make me believe otherwise. I can fucking do this. I still haven't run a marathon and I'm already almost 24 years old! HOW DID I LET THIS HAPPEN?! HOW DID I GO SO WRONG? Don't bother trying to help because you can't. Just know that I'm pissed off that I haven't quit and if you haven't quit yet and aren't as pissed as I am you better fucking start being pissed because you're fucking up! QUIT FUCKING UP! DON'T WAIT FOR AN ULTIMATUM! DON'T WAIT FOR AN ARBITRARY REASON JUST FUCKING DO IT! NOW! IT'S OVER! DONE! FUCK YOU MARLBORO! I SENT SOMEONE'S KID TO FUCKING COLLEGE AND I DON'T HAVE A DEGREE OR EVEN A FUCKING HOME. FUCK YOU. FUCK ALL OF YOU!

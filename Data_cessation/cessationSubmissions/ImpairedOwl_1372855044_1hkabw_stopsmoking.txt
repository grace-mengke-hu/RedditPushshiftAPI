Dreaming of smoking

I keep dreaming I smoke. It has become much more frequent lately, almost every night now. The first few months after I quit, I would dream I would smoke every once in a while, and in the dream I would know I was cheating, and wake up feeling guilty. But lately it is not only more frequent, but the guilt is gone, and I'm smoking casually, as I did before I quit. 

I know some people have similar dreams. Does it ever go away?

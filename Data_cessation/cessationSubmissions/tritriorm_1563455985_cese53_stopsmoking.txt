Strange and Intense Physical Withdrawal Symptoms

I’ve just finished day 2 and am entering day 3. Each night, once I get relaxed and comfortable, I feel my entire heartbeat throughout my body starting in my throat. It feels as if I have a strange pulsating sensation, almost like a full body headache, which is very uncomfortable. When I fall asleep I wake up an hour later, surprised (I have no idea why) and wide awake. Then I wake up the same way in another hour. After these first two disturbances I still wake up throughout the night but after longer periods of sleep. None of this is like me at all, I am generally a very heavy sleeper! This is also extremely frustrating, as I’m sure you all can imagine and has happened to me night 1 and night 2 of being nicotine free (quit smoking/vaping after 13 years - from 13-25). I’ve been trying to search these symptoms online and it says they are common but there is no detailed explanation of why &amp;/or what I’m going through,

Has anyone else experienced this?

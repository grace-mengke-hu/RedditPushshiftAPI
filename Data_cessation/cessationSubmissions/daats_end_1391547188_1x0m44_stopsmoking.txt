Why I have to...

Five months ago, I managed to quit for three weeks, and it went pretty smoothly.  Then my father, a life long smoker, had a stroke.  I watched as the man who had helped launch people into space, the man who helped design and maintain the shuttles' robotic arms laid in a bed, unable to move or speak slowly decline into further darkness.  Then he died.  My fiancee's sister died of cancer just a year before we met, and I was honored to stand with her as she scattered her ashes to the ocean.  Words fail to describe what she means to me and how broken I would be without her, and I don't even want to think of how she would get by without me.  I know that every puff on a cigarette is one more breath I will lose with her, and the thought of stealing those breaths from us is, to me, far worse than death itself.

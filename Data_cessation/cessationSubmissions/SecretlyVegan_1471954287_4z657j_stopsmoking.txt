Three weeks!

I've made it this far!

But seriously during these three weeks I have started to feel a lot better about myself, my breathing is better, my energy levels are higher, I sleep somewhat better. I smell things now too! I didn't know smells were everywhere like this!

The cough sucks, it's not constant, but I do find myself coughing up some weird ectoplasm every now and then. My anxiety levels fluctuate a lot and I need to keep an eye on my caffeine intake in order to keep calm.

One of the best things is that my quit motivated my mother to quit too. She's closing in on one week now and!

I don't have cravings anymore, I have thoughts of smoking and thoughts of buying a pack, but they're so easy to dismiss that I don't count them as cravings.

Keep on not smoking people, it will get better for you too. You only lose when you stop trying!

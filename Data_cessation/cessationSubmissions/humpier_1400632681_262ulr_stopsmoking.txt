Second time, day 5 and I started making mental excuses

I quit for the first time almost a year ago but then I slipped up. I went back to smoking for about a month when I got up the nerve to quit again 5 days ago when I left for a vacation. Now that I'm on my way back home I can feel my mind making excuses. Shit like, "you've quit before so you can do it again" and "just have one tonight to celebrate. You did good this week." You all know those demons I'm sure.

Anyway I'm not going to smoke. I know I just need to get through the worst of it. I just needed to vent. Stay strong everyone!

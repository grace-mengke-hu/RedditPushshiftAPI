Quit smoking 4 months ago but still short of breath

I used to smoke poppers regularly (for anyone who doesnt know in Canada a popper is when you smoke cigarette tobacco with weed on top through a bong). I did this anywhere from 4 to 10 times a day for about 6 months and it progressed to the point where my bowls were massive and probably 80% tobacco. It was nasty, I'll admit. Anyway, I quit about 4 months ago but I am feeling slightly short of breath when I walk up stairs and now cough up mucus in the mornings (which I never did before). I am kind of scared and honestly I just don't know if its normal. Doctors have told me my breathing sounds normal but I just dont feel like everything is right. Is anyone going through a similar thing? Thanks everyone

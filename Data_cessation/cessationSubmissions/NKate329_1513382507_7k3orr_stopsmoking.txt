One of the hardest things I’ve ever done.

I’m giving up vaping. I know this subreddit is about smoking, but no one ever talks about quitting vaping, everyone who vapes still thinks vaping is the greatest thing in the world.  I’ve been vaping exclusively for 3-4 years and I’m glad I made the switch from cigarettes, but vaping is no joke. I’m way more addicted than I ever was to the real thing. With cigarettes, I had to be sitting down to smoke, relaxing, enjoying. I wouldn’t even walk and smoke. With my vape, it’s like it’s part of my hand. I wake up in the middle of the night to vape. I stick my head out of the shower to vape.  (Typing this is making me want to vape.)

Two weeks ago tomorrow, I switched to zero nicotine in my vape, and I haven’t hit my vape at all in two days. I feel like a crazy person. 6 weeks ago I was at 18 mg nicotine. I had been wanting to quit for a few months, because when I turned 30 I realized I had been consuming nicotine for half my life. So I weaned down to 6, then 3, then 1.5. 1.5 to 0 should be a breeze, right?  WRONG. One day last week I told my husband that if it weren’t for him and our daughter, I would jump off a bridge. I cried one night for no reason, and immediately started crying when I woke up the next morning. I’ve never suffered from depression or anxiety, I’m generally pretty happy, even when I’m going through a rough patch in life. The worst part is after I eat and when I wake up in the morning. I think I would even be happy to vape 0 nicotine, but I go through 0 so fast that I can’t afford it.

What motivated me this time is I currently get “preferred premiums” on my insurance at work because I’ve met certain criteria.  One of the requirements last year was we had to sign an affidavit stating that we don’t use tobacco. I don’t use tobacco, so I qualified. This year, they’re making us do a mouth swab for nicotine on January 8th. I really don’t want my insurance to go up, so it’s time to quit.

Tip for getting off nicotine gum after quitting smoking.

If you're currently on nicotine gum and are looking to get off sooner or later then I'd take this tip if you're looking to leave nic for good. As soon as you're ready to ditch the nic completely, go grab a pack of any hard sugar coated gum(preferably minty) and use it the exact same way as you did with the nic gum. The feeling of a minty gum under your lip will give you almost the exact same sensation as the nic gum did. In my opinion, it was easier to take this route rather than ditch the nic gum cold turkey style. My new hobby is chewing minty gum like dip :)

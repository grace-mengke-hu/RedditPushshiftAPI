Wait! Somethings wrong! This is too fricking easy!

Week one sucked.... but since day 10, I've had only the odd crave.... and they were entirely manageable. It totally has not been as dramatic, or as difficult as I feared. So why have I failed so often before? And why is THIS quit kicking nicotine's ass so easily? I'm genuinely confused. I suspect Allen Carr had a lot to do with it. 

Because I thought it would be so hard, I stalled. I thought
* No way. I can't do this
* I will be missing something
* I will eventually fail

Let me be clear. *I was 100% sure I would fail*! But it turns out I was wrong. The nicotine monster is like Freddy Kruger..... fear and nicotine make him stronger. You don't think about him, he goes away. You don't feed him, he dies. He can't fight you AT ALL if you don't smoke. It's an incredible weakness he has.... so you can kill him.

Why does the thought of quitting smoking scare me so much?

It's like every time I decide I want to stop smoking cigarettes it doesn't happen. I'll why but I get that same feeling in my stomach when I think about quitting that I get when I think about 20 years in the future. I really want to stop. I recently found out my mom has been smoking for my entire life and hid it from me and I want to quit bow more than ever if not just to show her that it can be done. But i don't know if I'm strong enough. I just don't know what to do anymore.

More than a year

Friends of mine who I don't see regularly told me they started smoking again a few months ago after 8 or 9 months without a cigarette. This makes me a little sad but also proud that I am able to stay strong. They stopped without reading The Easy Way. I will recommend it in a few weeks.

Whatever, keep up the good work, and remember: No matter, how stressful, sad, or whatever a moment is, smoking a cigarette will not help you or make it better.

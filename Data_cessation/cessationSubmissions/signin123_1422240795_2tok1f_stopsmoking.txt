Still struggling...

Hello hello! I'm here for suggestions, support, guidance, any help really.

I'm 29 and have been smoking since I was 14. I quit for 3 months twice before the age of 20, and the past 1 1/2 has been a series of quits followed by the seemingly inevitable lighting up (4-5 times).

I've read Allen Carr's book, I've been all over whyquit.com. I drink tons of water the first week and on some quits, I've worked out like crazy. I quit for health reasons, for a partner, for a job, all of the above, but I always find myself back smoking.

The longest I've ever quit was 5 months (ended 4 weeks ago), the last month was horrible. I literally pined for a cigarette, everyday of December was worse than the first week I quit. I decided to finally give.

I can't seem to shake the illogical and unreasonable idea that I can smoke casually.

I know I'm in store for COPD if this continues and my lifestyle doesn't accommodate this, but I feel that I will always smoke, that nothing will work.

What helped you finally quit after multiple relapses?

I'm ready for this to be over.

Today I have been suffering from narcolepsy pretty hard. Every time I stop moving I start falling asleep and this game is getting pretty old. I just want to fast forward to whatever point I'll finally be detoxed and won't have to deal with this again. I've actually had a few fleeting thoughts today of picking up a pack and taking a break from quitting for a bit, but I know it won't be a break, I'll be right back where I started.

I'm not going to smoke, I've already made that decision. I really just wanted to vent a bit about the whole process. Really, I'm just mad at the teenage me who could have avoided smoking easily and kept me from having to deal with this in the first place. Then I'm mad at the 20-something me who could have quit and shaken the withdrawal symptoms in a week but thought it was too hard. Yeah, I'm just mad at myself because that's really the only person I should be mad at.

Stay strong quitters. We can do this!

Need help, I'd like to be done, but I don't know where to start

Hi there!

I'm a 29 year old who has been smoking since 9th grade technically, but it didn't get serious until college. I mainly use cigarettes to cope with my anxiety disorder and ADHD, even though now its cigarettes that are causing me anxiety. I'm sick of being a slave to smoke breaks, smelling like smoke, and the health implications really freak me out, but the idea of quitting is really hard for me to grasp. I've never gone longer then a day without a smoke, even with nicotine replacements. 

I have no idea how to deal with the withdrawal, the thought of it alone makes me uncomfortable and actually want a smoke. And I know it sounds ridiculous but the idea of not having my life revolve around smoking is a little terrifying. I definitely smoke to cope with social anxiety. What do I do when I need an excuse to step out of party and take a minute to myself?  Or before I go into a new place? I smoke while I work on difficult projects. I punctuate pretty much everything with a cigarette, and it's just hard to imagine life without it. Does anyone have any advice for preparing for the reality of life without smoking and what the withdrawal is really like? Does anything really help curb the cravings?

I'd also love any resources or info people have on what nicotine is doing to my brain. Not the longterm effects or the gross-out photos, I'd like to really understand what it is thats appealing and addictive about smoking so that I can hack it like a videogame. 

Thanks for your help!

When does it end???

I thought I was doing pretty well.  I mean, I still have cravings. I still forget that I've quit smoking. I still have the blasted headache that I've had since day one. But, I'm managing. Every time I don't give into a craving, I'm super proud of myself. 

The only thing that isn't easy to manage is my irrational anger. Example:  11 yr old comes home from school incredibly sunburned. Concerned parent in me comes out. 
"Why didn't you call me when nobody had sunscreen?"  "I would have sent some with you, if the school would have allowed it."  "You're going to be in so much pain in a bit. I'll get aloe and ibuprofen for you."

Kid says that the teacher told them to bring sunscreen and she just forgot.  I immediately changed my tune. Now suddenly my kid is the idiot that didn't bring sunscreen to field day.  (I didn't call her that to her face )  I was so pissed at her that I told her it's on her if she's in pain later. She should have remembered sunscreen.   (Have I mentioned I'm a ginger and my kid is fair skinned as well?)  I spent the next half hour at my desk positively fuming at my kid.  

She's incredibly intelligent and I forget that she's only 11.  But, before I quit smoking, I wouldn't have been such an asshole about it. I hate who I am now. When do the insane mood swings end?

I made it 10 days!!

I have made it 10 days and couldn't be happier. 

If I can deal with finding and moving into a new home, dealing with a new kitten, dealing with flatmate disagreements along with depression and anxiety, all while quitting smoking, then going forward should be easy! (I hope!). 

I've noticed that my depression and anxiety have gotten so much better. My energy levels are back to normal and I can taste food properly again! 

I have been using a nicotine free ecigarette to help, but I barely touch it now. 

I just had to share with people who understood because I've hidden this from all my family!

I can't stand smoking any more. Time to quit.

Honestly I hate it now. I feel like shit. I worry all the time about getting cancer after a health scare the other month. I hate how much it costs. I just hate it.

I tried Allen Carr's easy way and it just didn't do it for me. I'm going to buy an ecig on Monday with the weakest liquid strength.

It's really difficult. I get terrible cravings and my girlfriend has no intention of quitting...

But I have to do this.

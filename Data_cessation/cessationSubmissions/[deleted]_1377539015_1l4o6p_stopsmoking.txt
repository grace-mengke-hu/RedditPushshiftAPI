[4 days]Feels like a new life...

Not a single urge to smoke, hell I'm not even thinking about smoking (I was smoking for 2 years prior, 6-7 or more cigarettes per day, so it's strange that I don't even have any withdrawal symptoms or urges after 4 days[I had on the first and second days, but not after], but I just gonna thank that for my good body). My life doesn't revolve around smoking anymore.

Also, went jogging yesterday night. I could run surprisingly a lot without getting tired (about twice which I was used to). No coughing, no suffocation, no heavy breathing. It was strange, yet I felt liberated. Thanks /r/stopsmoking for all your support! :)

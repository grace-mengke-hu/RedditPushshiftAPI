Why can't I stop eating Altoids

So I'm about two weeks out from quitting, and it's going really well! But one weird thing has been happening ever since I quit; for whatever reason, I can't stop eating altoids. Granted, I'd rather eat tons of breathmints than start smoking again, but I'm wondering if this is normal or really fucking bizarre.

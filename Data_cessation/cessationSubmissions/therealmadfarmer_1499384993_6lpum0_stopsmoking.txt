500 days!

For some reason I've been looking forward to this milestone. I'm glad to be here and I know that I'm never going back. I smoked a pack a day or more for 20 years. I was afraid to really try to quit for at least 10 of those and really never made a serious attempt, although I wanted to. I had a couple kids and wanted to quit more all the time. I read Alan Carr in 2 days a quit immediately. There have definitely been trying times, but I've known that I was a non-smoker from day one. This sub was a huge support, too. Thanks.

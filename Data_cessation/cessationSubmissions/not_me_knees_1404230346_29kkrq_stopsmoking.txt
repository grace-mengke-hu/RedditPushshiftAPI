Today is going to be the start for me also

Been fighting this for far to long, quitting and starting again far to many times. I have both patches and gum with me, but am going to try and just cold turkey it if at all possible.

I REALLY want this to not be a try but a do. I hate that I say that and end up weak and in the store buying smokes an hour later. Enough of this.

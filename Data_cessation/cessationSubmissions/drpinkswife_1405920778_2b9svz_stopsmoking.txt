1 Month AMA

Hahahah....I don't know why I typed that. Got my star! I'd like to firstly thank my husband for trying my patience to the point that I refused to cave out of shear stubbornness.  I'd like to thank this sub for all your support through the good moods, the bad moods, the long diatribes and numerous typos.  I plan to be here for the long haul. *It scares me a little to type that, like there is some kind of luck involved.* EVERYONE - if I can do this after 25+ years, a really shit month, and zero self confidence to start out with ANYONE can do this!  :DD  COME ON!!!

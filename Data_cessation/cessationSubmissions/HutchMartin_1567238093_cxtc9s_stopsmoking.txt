5 hours smoke free

I’ve struggled so much with smoking and attempts to quit. Today things clicked and I’ve given up now. 

The beauty is that I don’t actually have to do anything. Just not smoke. And that’s easy. I had a depressed outlook generally so I have to exercise and socialise and really change a few areas of my life.

FAVOURITE parts of the Allen car book. Not to hope to quit but to know for certain that you’ve smoked your last cigarette. That’s where I’m at, certainty. Like the sun will rise tomorrow. I’ll not let nicotine in my body.

Please share your own thoughts. It’s important to keep thinking about smoking while your body gets rid of the poison.

Peace and love!

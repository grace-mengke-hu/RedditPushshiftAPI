My life is a fucking mess and for the 3rd day in a row I wanted a smoke

and my son is smoking (outside on the balcony, though). 

I just need to vent a little. 

Yesterday I almost caved but I remembered how the smoke felt horrible, how guilty and dirty I felt. I don't want to smoke but sometimes it feels like i need it.

Just smoked my last cigarette.

After putting it off for far too long I've decided to quit.  Smoked the last cig in my pack, subbed here, downloaded smoke free and bought premium to help convince myself that failure would be wasting the money I just spent.  Told my friends I'm quitting to give myself accountability, and now I'm posting here to give myself more.  Wish me luck!

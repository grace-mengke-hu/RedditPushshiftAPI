New and trying to quit.

I'm trying to quit. I've quit in the past and somehow I fall back into the habit. I'm looking for some advice. For some reason, it seems harder to quit this time. What are some of the steps other users have taken to prepare themselves for quitting? How do you keep from going back to smoking? I know these seem like basic, silly questions that simple google searches can help with but seeing what actually works for other users is more valuable than some article's advice.

Also, it looks like there is an android app some members are using. What app is it? Thanks!

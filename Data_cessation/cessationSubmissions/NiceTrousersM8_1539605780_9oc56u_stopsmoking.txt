Reflections after a year smoke free.

Hey guys, 

&amp;#x200B;

I posted here for the first time on the 19th of October 2017, after I had been smoke free for 5 days. I was in the middle of an argument with the girlfriend and felt like my resolve was being challenged, but that I was still feeling positive and strong despite the intrusive thoughts. Well, that was about a year ago now, and yesterday I hit my 12 months smoke free. Looking back on that post, it feels like a lifetime ago but also like it happened yesterday. So much has changed in that time, but I remember the feeling distinctly, I remember the last smoke, I remember the first couple of days and how weird and twitchy I felt, and I remember looking at everyone on Reddit, posting that they were a year smoke free and feeling so jealous. I didn't see how it could be possible for that much time to pass without smoking, back then I was counting down the minutes and hours, 12 months seemed impossible! And yet here I am.

In those 12 months, I've had my weak moments, and I've had times where I've felt like life was better when I was a smoker. Sometimes I've had a weird moment of nostalgia about it all, like it's an old friend that I lost touch with somewhere along the way. And then I remember waking up in the night with a horrible old man wheeze in my chest, and standing outside in the rain desperately sucking on that stupid stick and feeling the smoke tightening my windpipes and coughing my guts up and finding myself out of breath after climbing a flight of stairs and hiding it from my family and feeling guilty and ashamed and terrified that this cough, this wheeze, this chest pain would be the one that would lead to that awful diagnosis and the crushing horror that it was all preventable, and then suddenly I don't miss it any more. I'm glad to be done with it. I can breathe clearly again, I can get on a train or a flight and not worry about the cravings, I don't have to make sure that I have tobacco in my pocket whenever I leave the house, I don't have to budget it in any more or think about whether it'll eventually kill me or ruin my life. I'm free, and i'm happy, and quitting was the best decision I ever made. And for everyone just starting out, you'll get here too. One day those cravings that feel so intense right now will be whispy, pathetic little memories that drift away just as quickly as the smoke that we all used to exhale, and you'll wonder why you were so scared and why it took you so long.

Thank you guys for all your support for those difficult first few days, and if anyone needs a comforting word then please get in touch and i'll do whatever I can. You're all excellent.

Also, that girlfriend I mentioned in my first post? She's 7 months pregnant with our first child. My little boy will grow up in a house without smoke, and that's the best motivation I could ask for.

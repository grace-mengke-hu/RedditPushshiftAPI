Getting frustrated

So, when it hits 11:00pm eastern time, I will have been smoke free for 6 days. The cravings suck, I want to go have a quick smoke, but I'm doing my best to ignore the urges. What's got me frustrated is that I am not seeing/feeling any positive gains in quitting. My lungs feel shittier than when I was smoking. I do not feel any better, nor am I smelling more. How long did it take you all  before you started to feel "better".

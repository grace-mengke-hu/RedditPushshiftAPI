This sub is saving me

I quit 376 days ago and reading the posts on here about long time quitters who fell back into the addiction has kept me on the straight and narrow. I'm waiting to hear back on if I have a new job and the old lie of "just one" keeps popping up. I know it won't help AT ALL thanks to all your honest posts about slipping. 

So thank you everyone.

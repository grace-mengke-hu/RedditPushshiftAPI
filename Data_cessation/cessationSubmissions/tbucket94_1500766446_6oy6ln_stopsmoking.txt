Got broken up with. I caved and bought a pack

Three God damn years of being tobacco free thrown away because someone decided to go and break my heart after a year together. I just got so broken up about it that I mindlessly walked to the 7/11 and bought a pack. I feel so ashamed of myself right now. I thought nothing could make me smoke again.

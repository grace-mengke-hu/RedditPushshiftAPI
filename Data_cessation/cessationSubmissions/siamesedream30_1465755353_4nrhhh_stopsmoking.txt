Morning coffee people, how did your quit go?

Because I'm really wanting to quit but that's the big thing that always scares me is not having my coffee and cigarettes in the morning. I work at home, and the days seem like they would be so hard without my morning vices, and then of course my whole rest of the day revolves around that stuff too. I've already read the Alan Car book and tried to quit lots of times with it. I tried to read it again yesterday but none of the ideas are clicking with me anymore. I feel kind of stuck any feedback would be appreciated, thanks.

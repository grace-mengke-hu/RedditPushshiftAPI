Stopped November 2nd and haven't had any problems!!

Decided to see if this was actually a sub and it was. XD Im just posting to say good luck to anyone trying to quit or stay quit. I smoked from 17 until 22 decided to stop with a friend and neither of us have smoked since November 2nd. This wasn't the first time I had tried to quit but it was the first time I stayed quit. I know the struggle is real. Best of luck to every one, stay strong.

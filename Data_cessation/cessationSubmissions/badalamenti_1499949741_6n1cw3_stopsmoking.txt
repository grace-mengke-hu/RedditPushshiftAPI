"The thing is: every one of them smokes"

Hello everyone! How is it going?

I'm 2months and 16days smoke free by now, after 7 years of smoking (got to 1pack a day).

I'm on vacation now, with my friends. We are at the sea side, enjoying the sun and the beach and the clubs by night. The thing is: every one of them smokes. Even one friends who says he only smokes now because is on vacation. I enjoy being smoke free and I know that if I smoke one cigarette I will go right back in the dirty habit very soon. But they all look as if they are having the time of their lives and everything's great for them AND I'm being punished. 
How do you think I should deal with this situation? Any advice is accepted. Ask if you need further details. I will appreciate any sort of help. I want to stay smoke free. Just need the right mindset (i guess). 

Thank you! I wish you all the best.

7 Day's Free!

Today is my 7th day!  First day wasn't too bad, 2nd through 4th were rough in regards to withdrawls.  Saturday was the worst with cravings as I had to go out and do errands.  Usually with errands I'd get a coffee and smoke as my "treat."  I barrelled through though and wow it feels great to take a deep lung full of AIR and not toxins.  Looking forward to warmer weather when I can put these lungfuls of fresh air to good use with jogging.  I jogged even as a smoker, but as a non-smoker it's going to be so much better!

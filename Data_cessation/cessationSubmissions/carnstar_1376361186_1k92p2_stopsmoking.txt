Feeling kind of weird after taking a nicotine patch step down. Anybody else?

I stepped down from my patch about a week ago.  The day after I stepped down, my mood changed dramatically.  I felt sort of blue and depressed for a couple of days.  My cravings to smoke have also gone up quite a bit.  Has anyone else experienced anything similar?

Sicker than shit, can't imagine how much worse I'd feel if I were still a smoker.

Been dealing with a terrible cold for 5 days. Started in my head, has moved to my chest. My throat is on fire, my lungs ache, I'm wheezing, and I can't stop coughing. Despite feeling like death warmed over, I'm so grateful for being 6 months nicotine free. I can't even begin to imagine how much worse I'd feel if I were suffering through this cold while murdering my lungs multiple times a day!

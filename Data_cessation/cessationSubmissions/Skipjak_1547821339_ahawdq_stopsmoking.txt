6 months smoke-free

Checking in here for the first time in a while. I'm proud say that I have not smoked for half a year, without cheating once. It hasn't been easy, and I still get occasional cravings, but they quickly subside. 

A loved one getting lung cancer from smoking has been an excellent motivator. We all know smoking is bad for you, but we all believe that WE somehow will get spared from cancer, heart disease and COPD. The truth is that, if we are to continue smoking, we will not be spared from it. If we continue smoking we will likely die a painful death and leave our devastated family and friends behind. We only have one (relatively short) life, it is a shame to spend it as an addict. Give yourself some love and stop smoking. Good luck to everyone!

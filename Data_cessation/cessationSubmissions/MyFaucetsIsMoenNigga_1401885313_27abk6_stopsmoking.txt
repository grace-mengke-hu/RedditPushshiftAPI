1 week no cigs, today I forgot my patch, and my e-cig is dead.. fuck it.. I got this!

It was going to come to this eventually. It's like the end of an action movie and our hero drops his weapon and med and cigarettes decided to go hand to hand. Sure I didn't think I was going to be ready this early but here I am, I made it this far and there is no turning back. It is literally life and death that I beat this. And when I finally kick the habit off a building or into a giant blender I will say something sweet like.. "Looks like you are the one who's up in smoke"

Losing my mind a bit.. i'll work on the catch phrases.. but I got this bring it on bitch ass cravings!!

Day 5 Can't concentrate, have to study!

I'm 25 years old and have been smoking for six years now. I tried quitting cold turkey before but lasted only a day. This time I feel much better, much more motiviated. I'm using Nictoine mint (2mg, 3 times per day) and vaping (without nicotine) 

I can handle the cravings really well, mostly because I started smoking after a traumatic experience in my life (death of a very close friend) which has caused my personality to change in a lot of ways (more prone to depression, more anxious..). It's much better now than three years ago, but I still want to be done with the smoking. I feel like if I quit smoking, I will regain a part of who I was, that I somehow lost along the way. Maybe this isn't true, but I use such thoughts all the time to manage any cravings and stick to my desicion.

My only real problem is, I have exams in two months and I need to start studying. I can't concentrate at all, my thoughts always divert towards smoking and I get distracted all the time. I also was on vacation for two weeks, so I lost my momentum and now it's extra hard to get back that focus, without my usual routine, which includes chain-smoking, break-smoke...etc

I keep thinking "Quit after your exams!" but it's really stupid talk. I study math and plan to continue to graduate school so I always will be busy, always will have to study a lot, always will have exams! There will be no time in the coming few years where I can afford to lose focus for extended period without getting anxious and sad about it. So better now, because there will be no perfect time anyway.

I am still feeling really low though and it seems to be getting worse the longer I go without studying. Will this be over soon? I keep thinking this will last forever or at least for a few months, which will fuck up my exams anyway..

Should I continue and then stop? I'm confused and don't know what to do..

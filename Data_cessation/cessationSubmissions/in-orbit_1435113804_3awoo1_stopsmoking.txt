day 5 and I feel AMAZING thanks for being here !

(my badge says 3 days but it last Thursday night was my last ciggie). 
Redditors I feel so amazing! day 3 was the **worst**, I woke up with a huge migraine and my head was in a fog all day. Day 4 was ok - I still had some craving. But today - WOW - I feel healthier than I've been in a lonnng time. I can fully inhale/exhale, don't look so dehydrated and can really smell everything. Last night, three beers in and I though, *damn now would be a perfect time to light one* but nope I didn't and this morning I woke up with a glowing face full of pride. On the way back from work I treated myself to my favorite organic beauty [products](http://i.imgur.com/5ggXCVg.jpg) and am planning on spending the evening in spa mode. <3
So thanks everybody, before last Thursday it had been 8 years of smoking daily but now is the beginning of the rest of my beautiful life :D

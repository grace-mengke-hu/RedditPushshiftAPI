Getting rid of actual desire to smoke

Hey guys! So I'm a frequent reader and have actually posted a few times. I'm at a point in my smoking where I feel like I have one foot off the edge but I'm having trouble jumping completely off. My main problem is 90% of me wants to quit smoking but the 10% has led to the repetitive failures. I almost feel like my stubbornness is my greatest downfall. What worked for y'all in actually wanting to completely give up this addiction? Any advice would be great...I feel hopeless to a degree. Thanks! 

Also, don't be fooled by the badge. I just emailed the badge bot to change my date.

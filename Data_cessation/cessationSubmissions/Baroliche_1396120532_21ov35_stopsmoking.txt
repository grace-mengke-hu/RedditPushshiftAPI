How?

I need to stop, I want to stop.

Smoking is terrible, but it has worked its way into my life not just as an addiction, but as a stress coping mechanism.

Not just the nicotine high, but avoiding stressful things while on a smoke break.

For the toughest cases out there, how did you do it?  Cold turkey?  Reduction over time? 

Ultimately I realize it's up to me and under my control, but for successful quitters, even if only a few weeks in, how do you deal with it?

Edit: thank you all for sharing you experiences and advice.  Ultimately I need to get my shit together and stop.  Your stories and shared struggle really do help.  Thank you.

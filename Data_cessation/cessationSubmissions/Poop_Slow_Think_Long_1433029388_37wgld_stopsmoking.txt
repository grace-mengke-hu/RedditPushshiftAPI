Had a nice surprise just before an operation

So I'm being wheeled into an OR and just about to be sedated. They've finished hooking me up to the monitoring machines and one catches my eye, so I ask.

*"That's your o2 saturation in percentage; if you were a smoker that would read a fair bit lower than it does now."*

I used to be a smoker for almost 8 years I replied, but I quit 10 months ago. 

I turned back and smiled at the bright yellow '100' figure on the screen before being told - *sleep time, now - poop_slow_think_long*.

I woke up without an appendix. But knowing my lungs are in excellent condition still, was very nice to know. 

It's never too late to quit dudes.

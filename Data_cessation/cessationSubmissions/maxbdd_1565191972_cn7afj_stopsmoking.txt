Stop Smoking - Start ... ?

Hi friends :)  


I am 22 years old, this summer, my will to stop smoking has never been stronger. I literally think about it 20 times a day. 2 weeks ago, I told myself I would on next Monday. Monday came and around 10 am I... could not resist. And I have been smoking even more since this event.

I cannot stand it. On the first day, you stopped smoking, **when the craving was so hard: how did you face it, what did you do, what did you tell yourself?** 

It is like this small voice in your mind, that you cannot resist, nor ignore. It's like someone else is taking control of your will and telling you: it will be alright, just one and you can stop. 

I am thinking about **starting running the exact first day I will stop, in the morning**. It will relieve pressure in my body and hopefully helps me. **Did anyone ever try that? If not, did you build a new habit on the day you stopped smoking?**

**Have a good day everyone, and best of luck to anyone reading this. We will make it, together**

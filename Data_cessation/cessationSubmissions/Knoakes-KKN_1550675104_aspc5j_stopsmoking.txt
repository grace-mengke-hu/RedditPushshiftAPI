Why the weird Sensation?

So I worked out yesterday for the first time in a while and after I worked out all I wanted was a cigarette. Why? I’ve stop smoking for 16 days and I did have one slip but it was a jewel so wasn’t really a cigarette but it did have nicotine in it. I felt great after working out why would I want a cigarette it would’ve just made me feel sick!

Day 2. I am being a real dick.

I literally just hit 48 hours about 23 mins ago. My girlfriend was over at my place, and I was making dinner for her. I was making pasta with sauce, and she was continually telling me how to do things condescendingly. To add to this my roommate was fucking with me (as he is known to do) and I eventually just became a dick. Yelling at both of them, making passive aggressive remarks, the like. I plan to apologize and make amends to them, but I also wanted to vent this. 
I know that a cigarette will not fix this problem at all, and of course my drug addicted mind is telling me it will. Both my girlfriend, and my roommate smoke, although while it does bring up cravings, people will smoke, and I am not so selfish to think that they shouldn't because I am around. 
I don't really know, it became a ramble. I know I will be so much happier once I'm on the other side, but some experience, and hope would be awesome. 

TL;DR: Just past 48 hours. Really irritated, and was a jerk to my girlfriend and roommate. Looking for some encouragement.

Edit: Thank you for all the support guys.

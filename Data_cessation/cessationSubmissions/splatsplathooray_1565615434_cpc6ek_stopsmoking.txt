2 days down, but does it really count?

My last day smoking was Friday, but I have been sick all weekend. I’ve been really wanting to quit, but I can’t seem to as I smoke every time I have a drink.... which is every night (another issue). I didn’t smoke or drink Saturday or Sunday. Now that the cold is gone, I feel pretty good. Can I be proud of this or was it kind of a fluke because I was sick and obviously had no interest in smoking or drinking? Praying I keep it up now that I’m feeling better.

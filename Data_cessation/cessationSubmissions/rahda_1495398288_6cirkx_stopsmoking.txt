Getting close to 90 days! I feel so free

It has gotten immensely easier. The first 6 weeks were very intense. It has been getting easier and easier. I feel less anxious. I am more focused and clear headed. I have faced some of the biggest triggers I could and did it without lighting up. It is feeling more and more like a thing I used to do. It has no power over me like it did. Oh thank goodness and goddess. All of you doing it, keep going. One day at a time and it does work. It does get easier. And you are becoming more and more free and healthy.

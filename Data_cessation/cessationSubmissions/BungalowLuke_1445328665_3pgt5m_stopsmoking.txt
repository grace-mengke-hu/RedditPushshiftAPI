Small lapse...

Felt terrible yesterday and ended up smoking a roll up. I honestly felt even worse afterwards, my heart was pounding and even ached a bit when I got into bed! Feel like I'm so much more motivated to quit now, knowing how horrible it felt smoking again! Don't make the same mistake as me!

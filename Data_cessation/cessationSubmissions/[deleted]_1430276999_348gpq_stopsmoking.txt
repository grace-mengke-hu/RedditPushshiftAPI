I'd like to try vaping. Where to start?

I'm not a super heavy smoker, about 1/3 pack a day for 2 years, but I'd really like to stop very soon because I want to start kickboxing with my son. I'm very active and athletic but I feel like the cigarettes are really effecting my conditioning. I want to be able to get in the ring with my son and still kick his ass for 10 rounds straight.

So this brings me to the idea of trying the vape. I've see some at the drug store for ~$15, while some of my friends spend are spending $200 on theirs. Whats the difference between these? Does anyone have a good recommendation of where to start or their experiences with vapes?

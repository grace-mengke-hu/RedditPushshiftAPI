Just crushed last 3 cigarettes.

Hi Redditors,

Just crushed the last 3 cigarettes and threw them in trash. I am shit scared of 'em Cancer Sticks.

Do let me know how to control my urges from your experiences.

PS: not the first time that I gave up smoking, usually by the 3rd week. I tend to start smoking again.

Thanks.

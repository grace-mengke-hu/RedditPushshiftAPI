Try again tomorrow

So i thought it would be cool if i ruined 31 days of progress by purchasing a pack of smokes yesterday. I won't go into details as to why, but instead consider this a stumble on the road to success.  

It is not my goal to "quit smoking." It is instead to become a nonsmoker. Tomorrow, I am getting right back to it, and sticking with it. 

If there is anything i have learned from this, it is that smoking cigs doesn't feel as good as running an 8 minute mile for the first time, which was a big accomplishment for me when I stopped. I'm not going to let smokes take that away from me.

Good luck to everybody. We can do it.

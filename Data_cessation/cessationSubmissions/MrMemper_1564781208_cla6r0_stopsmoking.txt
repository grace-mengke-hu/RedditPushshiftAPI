I’m at 3 days and 17 hours

I’m not sure what it was. Maybe a psychosomatic response to downloading the app but it’s working for me. Set it for my birthday (7/30). And just ended it. Was an on and off smoker for 20 years. When I get a small urge I just identify the feeling. It’s a bit of anxiety/tight feeling in my chest or something. 
And then I’ve been saying to myself: “Is this the worst of it? I can handle this”. 

What seems the most overwhelming is actually my emotions. I have slipped into a slight depression. I’m assuming this is due to the severe dip in dopamine my brain has been getting. It’ll level off in time I’m sure. 

It’s really been not as hard as I thought.

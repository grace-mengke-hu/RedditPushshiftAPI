[Day 5] My anger is my slippery slope

So they say to know your addiction. And I do. I picked up the pack when my family self destructed and was a whirl wind of hate. Smoking was my absolute best friend. Just like a cold glass of water after hours in the hot sun, smoking while driving away was that on my emotions.

Fast forward 8 years later. Got a great job, amazing girlfriend and cigarettes have been loosening their grip under these less stressful times. I've tried to put them up a few times and day 3 there's this evil thing inside of me that turns me into a grade A asshole. Irrational is the best word for it. And I don't want to be that person to my lovely girlfriend. Or my friends. So I rationalize and say, "You don't want to be that person, you aren't. Just go get a pack and try next time." 

I'm on day 5. Little fights that I have clearly started over the past 3 days that feel like I'm pearl harbor getting bombed when she says something so small. I just don't know how to deal with this. I truly don't want to smoke but my self medication is gone and I don't know how to be normal.

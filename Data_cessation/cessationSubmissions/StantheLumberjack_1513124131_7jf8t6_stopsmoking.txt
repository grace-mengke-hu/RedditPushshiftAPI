I’m about to fuck up again.

I passed a year of no smoking on October 6th. I’ve been trying to quit for years but addiction and depression certainly didn’t help. Somehow I finally made my longest run without smoking. I’ve lost weight, I’ve gotten more fit (ran a 5k in 45 minutes, couldn’t even do that in high school), and finally moved out to California(a lifelong dream of mine) Well my depression is back with a vengeance and I just bought a pack. I’m hating myself as I stare at this evil little rectangle because I’ve made it so far but I’ve never wanted a cigarette more. I don’t like doing this but can I have a little encouragement?

I'm trying to stop smoking cold turkey but there's a problem.

My body starts shaking uncontrolably when I get cravings and it lasts for about a minute, because of this most time I managed was 1 day without a puff, I think is something psychological but that's just an assumption... I've been a smoker for 13 years. 

Any tips to reduce the horrible withdrawal reaction? 

Sadly I'll have to wait until I finish my uni exams to try again. 

Also should I try gums or vaping?

Question about health effects of smoking vs nicotine in general.

I'm quitting. I'm using patches and they have been very helpful however I'm wondering if anyone could provide me with some info about the negative health effects of smoking vs negative effects of nicotine alone.  I'm mostly just curious about what bad things are still happening to me with the patches and what bad things are no longer happening by not smoking.

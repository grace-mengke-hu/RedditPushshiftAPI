Quit over 2 months ago - still having serious trouble sleeping

Hey guys, I tried looking around and couldn't find much discussion about this, but if anyone can point me toward information I'd appreciate it.

I quit smoking a little before Christmas last year after being a pack-a-day smoker for about 7 years, and I honestly feel great!

Or I would, if I could get some fucking sleep!

I know some restlessness is common when quitting but isnt it supposed to go away?  I wake up at 5 am for work, and prior to quitting I'd hop in bed around 9:30 and zonk out instantly.  Now I find myself tossing and turning for hours, and when I finally fall asleep I wake up an hour later.  I am averaging like 4 hours of sleep a night.

I've tried some normal strategies for helping with insomnia (lots of exercise, rejiggering my diet, etc.) With zero change.  The only thing that works is smoking weed, and that isnt something I want to do every night just to fall asleep...

ANY experience or advice would be super helpful, as this is driving me nuts.

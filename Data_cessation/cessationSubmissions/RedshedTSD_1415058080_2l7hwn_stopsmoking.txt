In need of help for my struggling little brother.

Hi everyone. I want to say thank you to all who offer help and advice every way you can to help people stop smoking in this sub. I didn't want to seek out books or psychiatrists for this specific situation, but real people who've dealt first hand with quitting. So here's my situation. My little brother is a great, smart, and talented young guy with potential to be great. But, he has an addictive personality.

He's now over 10 months sober after struggling with DUI's and broken friendships because of alcohol. He has made leaps and bounds when it comes to becoming the man I knew he could be when it comes to accepting responsibility, keeping healthy relationships, and being a much more positive person in general. The only thing though is a smoking habit which last time I was around him seemed like almost half a pack a day. He says one addiction at a time, but I know there's a way to handle both. I know it will take a very strong will, but I believe he can do it. I don't have any advice or any experience to give him guidance and suggestions. I am in extra worry mode right now because of my girlfriends grandfather has recently been diagnosed with terminal lung cancer due to years of smoking. It's so very sad and I feel helpless in all of it. I can't imagine losing my little brother to it now or years later when knowing I can try to do something to help him. I need advice on how to approach the situation with him and make him not feel overwhelmed. I love him so much and I want him to have a long and happy life. What should I tell him? Has anyone experienced quitting multiple addictions at once? I thank you all so much for any advice on this. Keep being strong and awesome everyone!

Anybody else get a high from quitting?

This is unofficially the 2nd time I've attempted to actually quit. I notice during the first week that I get kinda loopy almost like a guy with ADHD forgot to take his adderall. I feel less stressed, a better mood, I crash harder at the end of the day. Not sure how long this lasted last time but it's something I'm conscious of when I quit early on. I thought maybe it was something I made up in my head but this is the second time I've experienced it. It's also weird, I feel the physical/chemical craving separately from the desire to not smoke. It's as if my body is begging but my mind is saying no. Just curious if anybody has experienced these things as well.

8 days going strong.

So I'm on Bupropion and haven't had any serious cravings. I feel kind of guilty writing that out as so many people here are toughing through some real shit. 

Also, I developed a blood clot in my leg (unrelated) and I must say quitting while treating that sucks. Every twinge or tickle in my lungs is "Oh God that's the clot. Goodbye world"

Reading over this I realize I don't really have a point. Thanks to this sub for the support and encouragement.

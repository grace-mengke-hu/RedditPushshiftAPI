One year today!

I am happy to say that I never have anymore cravings and I very rarely even think of smoking.  Feels like a lifetime ago.  I wasted 23 years smoking and I wish I could go back in time and tell myself how much easier it has been to quit than I ever imagined.  Sure in the beginning I had cravings.  But I would just think to myself this is just one.  If I smoke then I will keep craving them.  I read Allen Carrs book and I came here daily for motivation and sometimes support for the first month.  Congrats to all who have quit and if you are still smoking good luck on quitting.  If I can quit anyone can.

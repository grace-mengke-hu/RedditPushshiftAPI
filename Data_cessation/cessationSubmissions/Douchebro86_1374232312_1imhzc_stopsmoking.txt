Almost 7 weeks and I feel like a new person! Advice for the weekend:

Its been a while since I checked in on r/stopsmoking, but seeing that its Friday, and I am so happy to be a non-smoker, here's some advice for the guys going into the weekend with bad cravings:

-Don't go out partying it you're not 100% sure you can handle smokers around you.

-Download an App on your phone, there are MANY out there. Most of them will constantly remind you of how bad it actually is for your health.

-Don't get drunk. AT ALL.

-Remember why you quit. 

-Focus on your goals.

-Its a chemical your body thinks it needs. You don't.

-Find something to keep you busy.

-Go outside and smell the fresh air (you can have all of that fresh air for free if you decide to continue quitting smoking )



I'm off to enjoy all the new found energy! Enjoy a smoke free weekend! :)

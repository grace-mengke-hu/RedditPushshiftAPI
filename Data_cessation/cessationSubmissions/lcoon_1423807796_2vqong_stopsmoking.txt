Still smoking in my dreams

Last night I had a very vivid dream about having an intence craving.. Then I talking myself into one cigarette, that led to another and another. At the end of the last cigarette I felt like I was a failure and that I let myself down. I really wished I didn't pick up that cigarette.

I have quit 3 times before but never had a dream remotely like this. Has anyone in the group have weird dreams while quitting?

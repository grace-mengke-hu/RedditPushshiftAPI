Hey reddit!
So I quit cold turkey on the 12th, 21 days ago after smoking for 10 years.
I can't tell you how better I feel, for all of you that have just started please hang in there guys!

I took a flight 3 days ago, and it was so nice to be able to sit for 3 hours without having that endless voice cry out for a smoke!
When I wake up in the mornings, I have so much energy, I am no longer a zombie for the first hour!

It is so nice to be able to talk to people without having to worry about your breath and clothes stinking! 
I actually can run half an hour every day without coughing like a madman.

I have saved over 100 euros ( paid my flight) and up to today I didnt smoke 520 of my usual cigarettes! 

For those of you who are doubting yourselves, please don't give in, you will not regret it!! 

Last but not least, thanks to this subreddit for all the support to me and others!

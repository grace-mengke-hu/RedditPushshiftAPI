40 days, 40 High Peaks

Hello all. Today is day 40, and yesterday marked my 40th High Peak in Adirondack State Park climbed. For those who don't know, there are 46 peaks in the ADK that were originally surveyed as greater than 4000 feet in elevation, and those who climb all of them earn the title as an Adirondack Forty-Sixer. It feels surreal to be 6 peaks away and I don't think I could have done it without becoming a non-smoker. It baffles me to think how I even made it to 30 while smoking!!

6 months quit smoking on June 15th

So I am coming up on 6 months smoke free cold turkey June 15th. One things for sure this has been the most difficult 6 months I have ever had. It does get easier but I must admit I still haven't beat the addiction. I'm just equipped with the tools and know what I need to do to stay away from smoking cigarettes. One thing I'm missing out on is a lack of support from others Since I've always been a closet smoker so I'm pretty much a closet quiter if that makes sense. only a few people know that I quit. I'm posting here for the first time to hopefully help others who are starting this journey to quit and get some help myself as we are all in this together. Thank you that is all !

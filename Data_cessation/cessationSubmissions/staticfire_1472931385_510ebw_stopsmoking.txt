Anyone have experience quitting vaping? I'm past 3 years no real cigarettes. Today is 2 months no e-cig/vaping/nicotine. My ADD symptoms are almost unbearable. It is so hard for me to focus on anything. I want to start vaping again. Someone please convince me not to.

NYE 2012 I stopped buying packs of cigarettes. I can't even remember when the last "real" cigarette I smoked was.


2 months ago I finally decided to quit my electronic cigarette/vaping nicotine after doing so daily for over 3 years. 


Then after a month nicotine free I decided fuck it might as well take a break from cannabis and caffeine also to get to baseline. I usually take a break every year. Well that was 2 weeks ago. I've started drinking caffeine again to help with ADD symptoms but I am still not smoking any cannabis for the time being.


Half the reason I quit smoking cannabis in the first place was because I felt like ever since I stopped vaping nicotine my ADD has been out of control. It's so hard for me to do anything that I use to be able to do with ease. I am struggling to complete simple tasks without getting distracted. 


Quitting cannabis hasn't really fixed my ADD symptoms like I hoped it might. I don't even miss cannabis that much I miss vaping which is kinda depressing.


Even when I take adderall I am still nowhere near as focused as I was when I was using my electronic cigarette and the adderall, I find myself easily distracted and focusing on things that are not important. 


Taking adderall makes me miss vaping even more, so I've been limiting it.


Despite how hard it was for me to quit vaping I have been thinking about going back to my electronic cigarette simply due to frustration with my lack of focus. 


Can anyone with experience please convince me starting nicotine/vaping again is a bad idea?


I don't know anyone whos quit vaping.

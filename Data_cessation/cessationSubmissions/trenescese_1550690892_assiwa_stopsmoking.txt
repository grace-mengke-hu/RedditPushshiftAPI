Started reducing amount of cigs a day, feels like something is missing.

Something is missing when I'm waiting for the bus with some time to spare

Something is missing when I'm walking home

Something is missing when I'm procrastinating at home

Something is missing when I finish the class and think of going outside

You know? I'm on cytisine so I don't have the typical nicotine cravings like I had when I couldn't smoke when I wasn't quitting, it feels a bit different. I think it's not craving but rather, uh, disruption of habits? Like smoking was so ingrained into my brain that not only I'm addicted to nicotine but the sheer act of smoking is pleasurable to me also? Feels like I'd feel better if I smoked anything, even without nicotine, like some kind of imaginary no-nicotine cigarettes or whatever lol. It's just pleasurable to inhale things.

Anyone else felt similar? How do you fight these feelings? What are they, exactly? Still nicotine talking?

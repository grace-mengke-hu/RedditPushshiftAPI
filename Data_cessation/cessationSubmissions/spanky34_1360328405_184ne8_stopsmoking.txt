65 Days in and Now I'm A Little Worried(update)

Thanks for the encouragement everyone. I made it through the14 hour trip to New York City without a cigarette! I even drove in Manhattan and didn't have one! Now I have to drive out of the city in the stupid storm. Once I'm out of the city I know I'm home free. 

Thanks again for all the help, I thought about you guys n gals a lot during my cravings.

Ah, 2 months!

And they've gone bloody quickly, too! I still have the occasional anxiety dream where I smoke, then wake up and take a while to realise I'm still on track after all. 

I'm about to embark on my uni dissertations. Haven't written an essay since last year and smoke breaks were crucial to me back then. These papers are going to be a grind, so wish me luck... I see danger ahead but I gotta face it head-on I guess!

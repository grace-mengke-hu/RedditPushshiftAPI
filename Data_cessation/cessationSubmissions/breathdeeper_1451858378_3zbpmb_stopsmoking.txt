111 hours with no smoke

Decided NYE was not the best time to quit, as I have done this multiple times. So far so good. This time feels different. Using the smoke free APP as well as this website for support. I'm also putting the money I'm not throwing away in a jar and plan on putting all in my daughters college fund :)

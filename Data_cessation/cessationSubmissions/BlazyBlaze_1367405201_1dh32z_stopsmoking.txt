Quiting take 1, lasted 2 days, starting take 2

Still want to quit, still want to be healthier, still belive I can do this thing. This was the longest ive ever been without a cigarette, which gives me a lot of pride in my self, and yet I cant help but feel demoralized and afraid from the next try. I dont know how ill make it through if my mom will keep smoking in the living room. Its hard enough without her filling the room with smoke. Anyway, I at least have to try.

Did you experience an improvement in mood after quitting?

I'm currently considering quitting cigarettes and am planning to use a nicotine vape to replace it. I've read that quitting cigarettes can lead to improvements in mood and lowered rates of depression. I'm depressed atm so this is very relevant to me. Does anyone know if this is true?

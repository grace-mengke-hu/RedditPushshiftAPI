Withdrawals: a week of hell followed by a week of bliss, sharpness, and pure happiness

So I have been consuming enormous amounts nicotine from smoking and chewing tobacco for the past one and a half month. I suffer from OCD and an extremely addictive prone behavior pattern. I have consumed nicotine for almost 10 years now, but it was nowhere near the level in the binge insanity that overcame me in the aforementioned time period. However, I’m at a prime age of 26 and reality is now hitting me hard in the face. I don’t have time for this addiction anymore. The first day was easy, the second day, at around 2 pm, I started getting those little nudges, and oh boy did they get powerful. On day 3, right after waking up, I started getting full blown anxiety and panic, and that when things got really really hard. Approximately 70 percent of my thought process involved rationalizing why I needed more nicotine. I got through the intense cravings by fighting it with an inner drive and courage. I couldn’t sleep well that night and I began to sweat profusely. I took care of myself and I meditated by breathing in essential oils drank an exorbitant amount of water and chamomile tea. Then came the bouts of depression and ups and downs. I took care of myself. Remember, it’s paramount to take care of yourself. Day 4 was just as bad as day 3, but I spent my day tiring myself out to such a point that all I wanted to do was just sink into the bed. On day 5, waved of the craving came into my mind from here and there. I kept thinking about one thing: LIBERATION. It’s so nice to be set free so you can breathe again, without this poison constricting  your whole body. By day 6, I started feeling a sense of power in me, and with the help of 5-HTP and lots of water, I could feel my system cleanse itself. By day 7, I WAS in control. The withdrawals and waves of cravings were almost gone. I was now free.

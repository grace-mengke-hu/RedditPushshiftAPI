Relapse after trying to quit

Hi. I'm 20(f) and I started smoking about 3 years ago with my friends. I know it's not a long time but I quickly came to hate it and I've been trying to quit for the past few months.
I recently joined this sub and got inspired to quit by the stories I read and I even got the Smoke free app I see a lot of guys using.
I made up my mind to finally quit about 5 days ago and my best friend has been supporting me but I caved today.
The worst part is the overwhelming guilt and disappointment I feel after failing. I haven't told my friend because I can't bear to let her know, considering how supportive and positive she's been all through. ( She HATES that I smoke)
I was just wondering if you guys have any tips to deal with the guilt you feel afterwards because it's drowning out all the hope I had to go through with quitting.

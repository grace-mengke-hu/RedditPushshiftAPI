I need to quit ..advice ?

Ok I'm 22 in 2 weeks and I am feeling my skin age, my lungs being shit and I don't like smoking anymore. I honestly can say I am addicted now. Been smoking on and off for 3 years now but ever since i've been smoking straights I feel like I am really addicted. I don't like the feeling. I don't smoke that many a day but when I do I chain smoke. As I am too shit at willpower to go cold turkey, I have started buying rollied again because I feel less likely to smoke as I chose how much tobacco to put in. Are patches any good ? Help me I want to be healthy again!

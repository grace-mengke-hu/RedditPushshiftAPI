Lies our brains tell us...

So here I am 29 days in, 20 a day prior to that... I don't miss anything about it I really don't, however today I check my account balance and realize I haven't saved a dime from non smoking, like I should have at minimum an extra $200 to my name, but nope notta...and where does my brain instantly go? "well at leas tyou would feel better if you were still smoking"


lol

I know, it's a lie, but I love how even now, it still creeps up there!

2 months!

Still going strong. 

There was, however, a weird wave the other day of feeling down - almost depressingly so - mixed with what I guess was a trigger to smoke a cigarette. I'm not sure how this even came to be. I did nothing out of routine. I only noticed it because it is very uncommon for me to to ever feel so down like nothing matters any more. That and of course the very strong trigger. It was just too weird. I decided at that point to take the dog for a walk , Something I've actually started enjoying , just for the smells and fresh air. This did what I intended and I felt much better.

What I found ...nice about the experience is that I never really had intent to pick up a cigarette because of it. And I also saw this desire for what it was and let it go.

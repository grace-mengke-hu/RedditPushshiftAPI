These two things helped me the most. I hope they will help you, too:

\- Get the Pavlov bell out of your mind. Always wait at least 5 minutes when you have cravings before you consider to smoke a cigarette. Evenif you still are a smoker, these five minutes will distract your brain from the immediate pleasure of smoking a cancer-stick. Be very strict about this with yourself since the main reason why nicotine is so addictive IS BECAUSE IT WORKS INSTANTLY!

\- Don't trust yourself. Nicotine as a molecule is very similar to serotonine, hence your brain over time started using it as a replacement. That's why smokers usually light one up in emotional situations like stress, pleasure or pain. It's very common that you will try to trick yourself or talk yourself into some reason for smoking a cig. Just be aware of it.

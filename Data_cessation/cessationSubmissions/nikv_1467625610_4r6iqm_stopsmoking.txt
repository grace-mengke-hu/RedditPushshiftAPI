Small hack to ride out a craving

Hi! I thought this could be helpful to the rest of you - because its helping me a LOT.
Its been 8 days since I've quit - and as the nicotine monster is deigned to do, its been playing havoc with my head. 
One day, I really really really wanted to smoke. I had all but given up, and threw in the towel, and picked up a cigarette to light. 
But then, i held the cigarette in my hand for a while. And slowly started breaking off a bit by bit. Before i knew it, I had broken off the whole cigarette, and also ridden the craving wave. This helped!! Hope it helps you too! Cheers!

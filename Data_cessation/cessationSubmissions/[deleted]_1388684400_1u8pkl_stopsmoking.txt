Quitting isn't a light switch. It's a process.

I was looking through some old facebook posts and realized that it took A YEAR, before quitting finally took. 
I know that sounds a little disappointing but there's a very good reason why it took me over a year to get my 81 day badge: After a relapse, I didn't get back on the wagon.

In other words, I stopped trying for a while. Then I'd quit for days. Relapse. Smoke for a couple weeks. Quit for a week. Smoke again. See the pattern here? I wasn't REALLY trying to quit. I was fiddling with it, but not committing. 

Quitting is not a light switch. It's a process. A process that may be different for every quitter. 

**Here's what worked for me:**

*Throw your smoking junk away

*Clean your car out & remove all associated smoking stuff

*Recognize EVERY thought of smoking and the habit. Here's what I mean:

**Your day revolves around smoking**.

 You do certain things, to enable your habit. I would take car rides to nowhere. Just so I could smoke. I'd plan trips to grab some coffee... to smoke. Hell, those 15 minute breaks they give you at work are actually horrible for smokers. They look forward to them. They pine for them. If you're kept from something you THINK you like, you'll want it more and look forward to it more, when you get it. And the lie is perpetuated even more.

*When you recognize those thoughts that facilitate smoking.. change that routine. Don't go out. Don't leave the house. Do something else. The urge will pass.

*Nicotine withdrawal is NOTHING. After 3-5 days, you've got no excuse to be an asshole anymore. If you're angry or feeling something and think it's the withdrawal, you're fooling yourself.
*Have trouble with going to a bar and NOT smoking? There's no way around it. Sorry. You have to TRY at some point. Or you can stop going to bars. (Which is really the only reason I went to bars anyway. So I could smoke!) I don't go to bars anymore! And I don't miss it.


You have to TRY.
You have to recognize the thoughts that facilitate the habit.
You have to tell those thoughts to, "FUCK OFF".
You have to keep quitting.


**If you relapse, it is absolutely essential that you:**
Immediately throw your 'new' pack & lighter away (I know you just bought them, but why think logically now, when you've just let this stupid habit control your life, all this time?). Throw the SHIT out.


Then go over the 'You-have-to's' again.
Repeat.


Sooner or later, it will stick. Good luck!

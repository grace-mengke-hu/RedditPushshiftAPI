Smoking rooms still exist!

First post here! A check in to keep myself honest!

I quit smoking cigarettes two months and twelve days ago, slowly tapering nicotine with a vape. I'm traveling for Easter to see family and my boyfriend booked our hotel. He is a non smoker and we got to the floor and I was immediately assaulted with the cigarette smell. It's in the pillows on the bed, it's in the carpet, it's completely baked in.

I smoked for 12 years, pack a day etc. I never smoked inside and I hate this smell. Despite that, I'm now in one of the worst cravings since my first week. Smoking is one hell of a drug. Just wanted to share this bizarre situation, everything reeks of old cigarette smoke, I hate it, still want a cigarette...

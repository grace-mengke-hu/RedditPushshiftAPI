I don't smoke..

But I have subscribed anyway..

I'm making this post to congratulate everyone who is deciding to better themselves by quitting the poison. I have people in my distant family who are suffering from the effects of smoking and I know how hard it can be to quit this addiction, any addiction really. I have an arousal addiction (porn) which I'm slowly recovering from so I know how hard overcoming something which has pretty much changed your brain physically is, but let me assure you that it gets better, every second that is spent not indulging in your past habit is a success and is actually an investment towards better health and ultimately a better life!

Good luck!

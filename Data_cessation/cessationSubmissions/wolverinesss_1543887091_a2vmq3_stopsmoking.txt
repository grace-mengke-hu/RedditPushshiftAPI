Quit smoking for 6months and picked up pack after a really stressful month, looking for some support.

 I’m not sure if this is the right sub for this, but I smoked for 3 years in college and then vaped for 2 more. I quit completely around 6 months ago and hadn’t touched nicotine until day before yesterday. I had an extremely stressful month financially and emotionally and caved after a 16 hour work day. 

I just finished my second cigarette of the week and I’m feeling defeated and down on myself. I’m not sure if there is a support community or not for nicotine on here, but I could really use some advice or help.

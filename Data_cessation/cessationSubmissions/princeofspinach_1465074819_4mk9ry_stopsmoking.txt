how can be helpful to my quitting boyfriend?

my boyfriend has been smoking for 8 years, and has spent the last six months or so trying to quit. he has an addictive personality, and had rebounded a few times. he was at a pack a day, brought it down to 5 a day, then back up to 10, etc. he's tried reducing the number by one every week, but that didn't work. he's tried to quit "cold turkey" (while still using his ecig and nicotine gum) and ends up getting irritable and only thinking about cigarettes, and gives up after a day or two.
earlier on i was more strict, and attempted to put myself between him and the cigarettes. that just started to breed resentment, so i backed off
i've tried to be encouraging and understanding when he relapses; i tell him it's ok that he went back, but that he has to keep going. 
he's a delivery driver, so it's particularly hard to not smoke at work since driving is a huge trigger for him.

he tells me that he really appreciates my position in all this, but i want to know if there'd anything else i can do as a partner to help him quit! do you have any advice?

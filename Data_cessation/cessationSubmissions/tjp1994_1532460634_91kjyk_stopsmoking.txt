I swear quitting smoking (and vaping for that matter) is very good for anxiety/ depression

I probably would still be smoking if it were not for the constant anxiety that I seemed to have when I was a smoker. Although I already had underlying mental health issues, I found that I would always feel agitated and anxious in between cigarettes. It actually REALLY increased my anxiety. Can smoking really affect one in such a way? Say perhaps if theyâ€™re more vulnerable or sensitive?

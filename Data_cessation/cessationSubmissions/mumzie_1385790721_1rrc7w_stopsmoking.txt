Well I am back yet again

I don't know what else to say really. I pretty much stayed on this sub with my first "public" attempt to quit. In the past, I never really told anyone I was trying in case I caved. I didn't want to see the disappointment in their eyes. So, I gave it a go here. And failed after 2.5 days. I came on and admitted to my lapse, and then stopped coming. I didn't want to face the mirror, so to speak. Part of what I liked about this was the chance to also be motivation for someone else by posting my battle and what I was going through, as so many of you have also done. It is what helped me. So even though I hate to post this, I will. Just in case it helps others.   
I have reset my badge, just put out my last cig, having another go at it and I am not running away from my failure this time. I will face this down, and I will win.  
And thank you to all who share their own battles and offer support. It really does make a difference. At least to me.

Guys, It gets so much easier. Hang on!

First, I want to thank all of you who supported me in my first couple of weeks not smoking. Your kind words and relatable stories helped ease my anxiety and honestly helped me push forward. 

I'm not out of the woods, I am not a year in, but I am two months in. Looking back at this journey so far all I can say is, "Holyshit. There is no reason I put it off for that long." Of course there are going to be times, months, days, drunk moments where I might think I want to change my mind, but I've figured out reasons why even when I think I want one I don't. I wanted to share them with you all! 

* The smell. Holyshit. Even after a week of not smoking you can smell a cigarette a mile away and the smell on peoples clothes is kind of horrifically strong and awful. 
* The taste it leaves in your mouth. I feel like more people should talk about the taste in their mouth after they wake up and they've been smoking. No one wants to kiss your nasty morning/smokers breath. 
* My health. I was recently diagnosed with several health problems that are made worse with smoking. Even if you don't have health problems you're increasing your chance of heart attacks, sad shitty lungs, and cancer. 
* Control. I don't want my want for some little thing to overcome and overpower my wants for everything else in life. I don't want to think "before I have fun" or "before I start the day" I need this cigarette. No. I want to be able to hop out of bed and enjoy my life without any strings.


Anyone else have anything to add?

To quit before the Holidays or after?

I've had bad chest pains (minor) frequently lately and I'm having trouble breathing. I've been wanting to quit for a while now but with stress being my biggest trigger and the holidays coming up should I even attempt to quit? 

I've been reading the "Easy Way" and it's been helping reframe my mind but I'm still scared of how I'm gonna quit when my husband still smokes and the holidays are a major stress for me.

I want to be done with it but also terrified I won't be able to. While Allen Carr recommends going cold turkey I don't think that works for everyone including me. I've quit several times over the years with lozenges but didn't have the mental mindset to get over the psychological aspect but now I do.

What has worked for you and any suggestions with quitting during or after the holidays?

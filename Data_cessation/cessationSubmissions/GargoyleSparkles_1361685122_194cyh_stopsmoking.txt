Just Smoked My Last One

I started smoking at age 14. I have gone up and down from a handful of cigarettes a day to almost 2 packs per day. I've been smoking for half of my life.

I first started telling myself that I would quit by the time I was 30. Then I turned 29 and told myself that I would quit once I got a less stressful job (I currently work customer service in a call center-like environment). Then I told myself that on top of that, I would *think* about quitting when I moved into a new apartment this coming July.

I previously tried to quit a year ago, using the patch. I actually had no real cravings or problems in terms of ridding myself of the habit. The issue came with my throat and lungs healing: I was coughing constantly, to the point where I could not sleep more than an hour a night, and 5 days in I started coughing up blood. I went to my doctor at that time and was prescribed Tessalon to help with the coughing, but I saw no relief. So I went back to cigarettes just so I could get some sleep and relief from the coughing.

Last week, I started a boot camp for roller derby. I had only done low impact exercise previously; the first practice, we had to warm up by running two laps around the skating rink. After one lap, I started having an asthma attack. That's right, I'm a smoker and I have *fucking exercise-induced asthma*. Halfway through the practice, as we were doing intense drills across the rink, the only words that kept running through my head were "I've gotta quit smoking, I've gotta quit smoking."

Those words have been in the back of my mind since then, nudging me. How badly do I want to do derby? How badly do I actually want to quit smoking? So I made this list of reasons why I want to quit:

* I'm tired of coughing up yellow phlegm all the time.

* I'm tired of taking breaks to go outside in the cold/rain/heat.

* I'm sick of my apartment/clothes/car/self smelling like shit.

* I want to be able to run more than a block without stopping and wheezing.

* I want my joints and lower back to stop hurting so much.

* Connected to the above, I don't want my osteoporosis to get worse. I have bone spurs on pretty much every vertebrae and I'm sure smoking has not helped that.

* I want to be able to smell and taste.

* I want to be able to sit through a movie at home without pausing for a smoke break.

* I want to be able to go places and visit friends without worrying about where I can smoke and dispose of the butt.

* I'm tired of being the only person in my office who smokes.

* I want to be able to meet new people and date without my smoking (or their non-smoking) being a prohibiting factor.

* I'm sick of having my life and actions controlled by something so disgusting.

So, fellow quitters, I downloaded the Cessation Nation app for my phone, and I have just set the counter. I have not told my family or friends about this yet, mainly because the previous quitting attempt (and failure) was met with a large amount of judgement. I'm doing this for me, anyway; I can let them know when I'm well on track.

That's my introduction, and hopefully not the last you'll hear from me on this sub. I want to thank you all from the start for all of the helpful information I have found already from lurking!

Is this a good or a terrible idea?

I just found this subreddit a few days ago and started reading through it during work. I am smoking for over 13 years now and never tried to quit. I don't know what triggered it, but all of a sudden I felt it is time to quit. 

I have a plan to achieve my goal but it might be controversy. I still want to share it, see what you guys think: I smoke a pack a day that is 5,10â‚¬. I don't want to tell people I am quitting because I am afraid of failing but I still have a feeling that I need the incentive of people relying on me. So I came up with this: In the beginning (first three months or so) I will define small milestones like five days smokefree. The money I have saved until then will be spent not for my pleasure, but I will just give it away; to charity or by making gifts to people I love. In that way failing to quit will be the equivalent of saying: "My personal pleasure is more important to me than children with cancer". Just think of saying such a sentence, you really never want to say that.

Am I a selfish bastard for attaching my goal of quitting cigarettes to the wellbeing of less fortunate people. Or is it a pragmatic idea that everybody benefits from? 

PS. I will stop smoking on the 7th of july, right after I finished my exams.

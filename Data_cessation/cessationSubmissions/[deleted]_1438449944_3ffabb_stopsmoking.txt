100 hours!

I didn't want to celebrate being smoke-free too early, as my previous attempts have usually lasted less than 8 hours, but now that I have 100 hours under my belt I feel like it's official. I quit smoking! I just want to thank everyone here for being an inspiration, and to remind anyone who needs it that you can do it!!!

Finishing day 6 and feel like I'm about to relapse

I am stressed the FUCK OUT! My brother is about to have a baby with a crazy chick. He's no where near stable, meaning in and out of jail. Work is crazy because I have a major deadline coming up. I just noticed a crack in the tile countertop I JUST finished! 

I'm almost not ashamed to say that I have the cigarette in my hand, I just don't have a lighter. At this moment.

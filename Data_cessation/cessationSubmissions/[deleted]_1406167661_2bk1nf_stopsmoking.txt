Reduced anxiety and 176 days!

I'm 176 days in and I've noticed a HUGE difference in my anxiety levels throughout the day. I can go into a store without wondering who is staring at me. I can workout at my gym without wondering what people are thinking. 

Today I was with a girl cuddling and normally they would ask "Why is your heart racing so fast". I would normally get heart palpitations or "heart flutters". but today my heart was normal! That's huge, guys. I remember being with a girl on my couch a year ago watching tv and I honestly couldn't pay attention to the tv because my thoughts were racing too fast.

I was on and off medication throughout high school for my anxiety but I had no idea that quitting smoking would help this much. Thank you, /r/stopsmoking!

I quit smoking 5 days ago...

...cold turkey... and the last two days have been horrible.

How long will this feeling of despair last? 


Should I smoke only one cigarette to calm down and continue as nothing ever happened?


Should I buy nicotine patches?

I have been a smoker for 9 years. I started when I was 15 and I am about to be 25 in end of the month. Any tips would be appreciated &lt;3 

Thanks a lot

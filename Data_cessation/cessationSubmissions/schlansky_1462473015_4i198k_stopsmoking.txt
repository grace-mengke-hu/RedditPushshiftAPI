666 days without a cigarette

So here I am. I have come a long way. 
I don´t think about smoking anymore. I don´t miss smoking anymore. I don´t fantasize about having a cigarette with my morning coffee or a beer. 

I don´t feel regret that I once smoked. It was just a trap I got myself into and something I did when I was younger. And now I have finally escaped.

To those of you who have still a battle to fight, you have my deepest sympathy. I know how hard it can be and the things you have to endure. These three ideas have helped me tremendously: 

* Keep at it. No matter what. Keep fighting. Don´t smoke that next cigarette. It is not easy and it is not supposed to be easy. It is worth it. Make yourself proud. Always remember that day for day, you will change your entire future for the better. If you don´t smoke today, you will prevail. (*"Isn't it funny how day by day nothing changes but when we look back everything is different..."* C.S Lewis)

* And don´t beat yourself up if you struggle and haven´t found a way to quit smoking. You will find a way that works for you, just keep trying. (*"I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work."* Thomas A. Edison)

* If you believe that smoking has some intrinsic value or could somehow improve your life - it doesn´t. I had this very idea that I could never enjoy life to the fullest without a cigarette. How absurd. You won´t miss anything without cigarettes - life gets better without them.

* The single most important resource is time. You can´t save it, trade it or buy it. It just goes away and one day you will die. The second you stop smoking and decide to not waste another second of your life - you will change. Your whole being can change. Listen to yourself, respect the time you have on this magnificent planet and make the most of it.

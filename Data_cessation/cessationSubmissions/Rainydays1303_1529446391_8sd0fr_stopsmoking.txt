It's been 33 hours since I smoked my last cigarette, and I feel...fine?

Hello everyone! First time posting on this sub, so a little bit of information about me: Up until yesterday I smoked almost a pack a day for about 6-7 years (from 18 to 24). I've been thinking about quitting for years now, but never really gave it a serious try (just thinking about quitting made me panic and chain smoke, ha) until I read about Allen Carr's book on Reddit. I had really such high hopes for it, and the reviews really made the book seem MAGIC. So I ordered it and then read it over the weekend.

Let me just say: This book did something to me. I don't know how, and I was still sceptical after reading the whole thing, but I figured I've got nothing to lose anyway, so I smoked my last cigarette and then threw the rest away.

That was Monday afternoon, and now it's Tuesday night and I actually feel FINE. I mean sure, I've got cravings and my brain still misses the nicotine, but they usually only last a few minutes and I can dismiss them quite easily. I also feel some fatigue and I have trouble concentrating, but it's not nearly as bad as I thought it would be. 

Is this normal? I'm actually feeling paranoid that this is just the beginning and that it will get much, much worse tomorrow, but so far, it's been actually pretty managable. How long until/when do the cravings and side effects start to get better? Will it get worse after today or is the worst already over? I feel like it's been easy until now because I've been at my parent's house the whole time, but I'm going back home tomorrow morning and I really fear that I'll give in when I'm alone again. 

So please, any advice, tips and tricks will be highly appreciated! Let's stay strong together :)

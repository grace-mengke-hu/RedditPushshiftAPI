18 hours feels like 18 days.

I apologize in advance for the second post in a single day. Just trying to stay as busy as I can. I haven't had a cigarette in 18 hours, and I knew this would be hard, but damn, this really is a struggle. I decided to post here to keep my mind off of running to the store. 

I have to admit, the fact that I'm struggling so much and it hasn't even been a full day yet is a little discouraging. But i'm going to try to push through.

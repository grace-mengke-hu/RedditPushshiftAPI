On the verge of smoking again only to take these cravings away

All day at work strong cravings even though i have not smoked at work for 3 years/even though i smoked back then.

On my mind all day 8 hours today not smoked for 4 months the thought of buying a ten pack is in my mind/but every time i go to the shop i say no? why when i could kill one/only smoked ten a day so surely not killing me..Confused want 1

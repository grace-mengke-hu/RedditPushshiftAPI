Day - 20 : ...

I got to help out at a bar yesterday so I worked with cleaning up empty glasses. But everytime I got out there were a lot of people smoking. I tried really hard not to inhale the smoke but sometimes I got stuck in the crowd so I had no choice but to breathe. 20 days and I haven't smoked but my throat feels like I've smoked a pack of cigarettes yesterday.
I feel really disgusting ..
But I should not .. But I don't work there so I don't have to do that again probably for a long long time ..

How are you holding up ?

No particular title

A few days ago I was here complaining about how my brain was trying to trick me. It still is, and I still almost cave to the cravings, but I haven't and I won't. And I was overwhelmed by the support of this subreddit. Thank you guys. When I was at work and seriously cranky, I really wanted a smoke (I couldn't, but I wanted to) and I re-read all the comments and it was so very nice.  
So right now I have been smoke free for [2 months and 2 days](https://i.imgur.com/nhUKmHF.png), and I have quit nicotine (NRT patches) at the start of day 57. Since I am now on day 61, that is 4.5 days ago.  
Nicotine lasts 3 days before it leaves your body, so I have been nicotine free for 1.5 days! That's 36 hours of no nicotine! For the first time in forever! I don't think I made it to this stage during my last quit, so this might as well mean I am nicotine free for the first time in over 15 years.  
I can't wait to see what life looks like on this side. I am proud of all of us, and I will not smoke with any of you today.

2nd Time

I tried stopping a 2 weeks ago and I failed terribly. I went on a 4 day vacation and decided that would be the best time. 2 days into the vacation, my girlfriend (who smokes occasionally now because of me) decided to smoke. That broke my will and I smoked a cigarette with her. After that one I stopped for 4 days and smoked again with a collegue. I realize that I have not been stopping, but just cutting down on the amount. On the bright side I didn't smoke a pack a day anymore. 
Until yesterday, when I bought a pack and smoked it all. I have this annoying smoker's cough again (I had lost that after not smoking for 3 days). I just smoked the last one and decided that was enough. Here goes cold turkey.

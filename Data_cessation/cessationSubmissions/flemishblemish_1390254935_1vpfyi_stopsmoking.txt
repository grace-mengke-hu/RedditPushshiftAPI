Tonight at 7:30 PM marks 30 days for me

And I'm super stoked about it! This subreddit has made it so much easier than my previous attempts ever were, so thank you all for being your awesome selves.

**A few things I've noticed in my 30 days**:

* After the first week, I had some pretty **vivid and realistic dreams**, when that never used to happen to me when I smoked. My sleep cycle is more more regular now and I generally wake up feeling better (except for the occasional restless night)
* Not sure if this is realistic or not, but it actually seems like **my lungs feel a bit bigger**, and that I can fill them with air a lot better than before. 
* Because of my better-feeling lungs, **I've been able to run a total of over 20 miles** in the four weeks since I quit, and my average mile time has been slowly decreasing. Thanks /r/C25k !
* **I feel happier and less anxious**. I used to have a really low-level of anxiety that followed me throughout the day. Now, it only pops up occasionally. 

I'm going to start shifting my focus from non-smoking to getting serious about my physical fitness. I'm going to gradually start reducing my drinking nights to once or twice a week, while increasing my training and lifting schedules to be a bit more aggressive. **Nowhere to go from here but up!**

So, thanks again, /r/stopsmoking, I feel like reading other people's successes and failures on here made my own that much easier to handle. You're all awesome, so keep doing what you're doing and stay strong!

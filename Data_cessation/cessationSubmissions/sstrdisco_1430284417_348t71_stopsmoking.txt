Bedtime's a trigger...

I'm used to having a smoke before bed. The last four nights I've taken cold medicine, because I've a cold, and it's knocked me out. I'm not taking anything tonight and I feel anxious, like I'm dreading going to bed without a final smoke.

I know that my body is nicotine free. I know that anger and irritability should have peaked. I feel breathing becoming easier. I know that an actual craving only lasts about three minutes. I know that at this point, a cigarette would taste gross and make me nauseous. It would most likely make me cough. It would make me stink and it would make me want more. I know that if I push through this mental obsession, the next one will be easier. I deserve to be nice to myself and a cigarette would be mean.

I am a non smoker. I've got this.

Thanks for listening, Reddit.

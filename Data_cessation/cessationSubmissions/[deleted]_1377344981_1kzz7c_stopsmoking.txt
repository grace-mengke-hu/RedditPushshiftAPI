How the hell do I drink without dying for a cigarette?

I finished reading Allen Carr's book a week ago, and for the most part all of my cravings are gone (this book really is magic - for those who haven't read it, do it now!!!!!!!). However, whenever I drink I still have an uncurable urge to smoke cigarettes. I have to struggle with myself all night to not light up. I'm terrified that this urge will never subside when I'm drinking, as even non-smokers crave cigs when they drink. Any words of wisdom/insight from ex-smokers?

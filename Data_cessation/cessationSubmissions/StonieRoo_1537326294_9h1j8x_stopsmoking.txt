Just Looking for Some Peace of Mind

Hi, I'm new here! I quit smoking in April this year, so 5 months ago. I smoked a pack a day for ten years. My cough was bad and has gotten better but I still have a small cough - I just need to clear my throat frequently throughout the day type thing. The paranoid part of me wants to get a chest x-ray but I'm also a hypochondriac and 1)I had childhood asthma 2)I still vape medical marijuana and 3)I have bad allergies. So it makes sense that my cough would take longer to clear.. right? Right? I'll probably make a doc appt but I also feel bad bothering my doc if it's obvious that I'm fine and a little throat-clearing(with occasional clear pleghm) is perfectly normal.

One Week Today

Hit my birthday recently and decided to give myself the gift of *really* quitting smoking.  I've quit off and on over the course of my 20-plus years as a smoker.  So glad to get through the first week without too much hardship.  I'm using a free app and this website as a support system and a place to use my hands in place of smoking.  Best of luck to everyone out there in a similar spot.

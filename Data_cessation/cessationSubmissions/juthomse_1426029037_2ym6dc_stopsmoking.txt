What gave you the power to stop?

4 years ago my sister died of cancer only 30 years old.
In about 1 month i will turn 30 years old. 
I had planned top stop around my birthday but...
8 days ago, early morning on my way to work, my lung suddenly collapsed and i was rushed to the hospital and stayed there for 3 days. I havent smoked since that morning neither used help what so ever. 

I think this was the only way for me to ever stop. 
8 days now and every hour getting easier, days getting better.

I truly admire you guys who stopped smoking, without any suddenly medical issue. You are the real deal, and i beleive you can do anything you set your mind to!

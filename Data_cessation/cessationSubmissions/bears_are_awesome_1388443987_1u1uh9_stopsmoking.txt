What did you get out of Carr?

I've been reading through Carr a bit lately (still struggling through some quitting attempts myself), and one thing I'm curious about is how many people had successfully quit for extended periods of time and found his book to still be enlightening? So far (truth time - I'm still reading, about 50% done) I feel I've made these revelations in the past when I was quit for 6+ months at a time. If you had these realizations before, how did you apply them when the going got though? Did you repeat it to yourself, any mental games maybe? Were a lot of these mental tricks just new and their power thus effective?

As a separate topic I really would love to hear what passages people found the most poignant, why they did so, and how they used them in their quit. As I make my way through the book, I really want to make sure I get as much as I can, and I'm sure others would to, so maybe having some pointers about what other people liked would be a good tip for how to read it.

I can start with the one thing that was really new to me - the idea that there really is no physical withdrawal. Reading that 97% of nicotine is of your body in hours was fairly liberating. It makes me less scared and worried about what's to come. It also really helps me view the process as a fight against your mind's trick, versus a physical inevitability of pain and doooom. In this light it really makes it harder to justify 'maybe tomorrow will be a better time,' or 'I just can't handle the physical side of thing now.'

Two months ago I quit smoking tobacco.

Smoked for about 20 years. I was heavily addicted to tobacco I guess in a self destructive behavior sort of way. I liked the application but I didn't like the animated stuff at the end of each mission. Most of my IM groups that's all they send now and its always dongs.

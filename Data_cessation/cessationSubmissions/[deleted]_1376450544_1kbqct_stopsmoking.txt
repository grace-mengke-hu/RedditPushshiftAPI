Finished the EASYWAY book. Extinguished my last cigarette last night.

It is harder than I anticipated as far as thinking about it. But when I do, I tell myself "Hell yeah, I am not a smoker anymore. I am going to be healthy again." I am ready to go at it, and prepared for the challenges ahead. I am destined not to fail this time. All my other attempts have been on nicotine and this is number 4. Last time I stayed off for 6 months, but this time I hope it is for good. Let me know if there is any ideas or advice to make it through these first few days while I cant get my mind off smoking. Glad to join you, r/StopSmoking!

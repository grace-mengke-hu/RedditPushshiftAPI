A month and a half in, struggling with myself and my roommate/quit buddy

I find it so strange that I can look back on the first month and feel it was easy, yet now I feel like I'm struggling. I'm finding myself trying to rationalize "just one" an awful lot lately, but I've remained iron willed in my dedication to the non smokers lifestyle. I want nothing to do with cigarettes or nicotine.

However, my roommate who helped inspire me quitting seems to be slowly lapsing back... He had a few puffs a couple days ago from a friend, he smoked a spliff (weed + tobacco) with another friend last night, and even commented "it's like I can use tobacco as a recreational drug again - it's like a cup of coffee!" Needless to say, this attitude towards nicotine bothers me. 

As a side note, my friends and I are into recreational use of a variety of drugs - responsibly and with moderation. Personally, I feel there's some things you can't fuck around with. Meth, heroin, pills, crack... And tobacco.

I know I could never even take just one puff, and I've talked about this with my roommate and friends (who, regardless of what they do, have my back) and so it's frustrating to see someone I care for be so cavalier about their use.

I've quit for a while before, and thought I could do what my roommate is doing now. It didn't work, and I smoked for 8 more years until now. I'm not making that mistake again.

It's hard right now though. Thanks for reading this if you did, I needed to get these thoughts out of my head.

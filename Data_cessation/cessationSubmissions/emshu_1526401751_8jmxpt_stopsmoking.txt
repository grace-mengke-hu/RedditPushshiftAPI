Feeling really tired

Planning on quitting again. Last time I quit smoking was for a year. Then I started again. It was stupid. Now I want to live smoke free again. But a few things I want to figure out before I quit again. Every time I tried quitting, I really wanted to sleep all the time. The feeling didnt't pass for about a month at least. What to do to combat the tiredness? Also, what to do about constant snacking that changes smoking? Last time I gained 40 kilos in one year. Any s≈≥ggestions deeply appreciated! P.s. been smoking for 12 years, pack a day.

today is my 32nd birthday

i don't have any flair, because i quit so unsuccessfully so many times that i quit doing flair updates.  i wanted to share my success  story briefly. i am proud to report that i quit smoking on june 3rd, 2015, after about 10 years. at the time, i was smoking about 4-5 packs per week. i haven't had a single molecule of nicotine since then. i want you guys to know two things. 
first, i am so so so happy to not be a smoker anymore. when you get on the other side of this, it feels like a this everlasting-gobstopper of an accomplishment, that you can keep going back to. for me, it's this beautiful proof that i can get things done. it's like those before-and-after photos of chris pratt. 
second -- in my case, i couldn't successfully quit without like 20 weeks of alcohol abstention. i just want to say -- if you're trying to quit, and your last five fuckups on quitting all happened when you were drinking, do yourself a favor. take a bit of an alcohol break and get serious about quitting smoking.

i love you guys and i'm so happy today. take care everyone

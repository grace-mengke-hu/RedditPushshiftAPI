Smoking while pregnant. Help.

I'm pregnant and I'm finding it really difficult to quit, I feel guilty and I've researched it a little bit but still... puff puff... I haven't had a ultrasound yet so maybe that will make a difference. I never thought I would smoke while pregnant. I'm very disappointed in myself. Any advice?

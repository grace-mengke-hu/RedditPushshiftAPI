Anyone in Vancouver BC want a stop smoking buddy to do activities with?

Hey fellow Vancouverites!  

I am a 10 year, 20 cigs a day smoker, who wants and needs to quit.  I have made the most successful attempts at quitting this year than I have my whole smoking life.  In quitting for a month or a few weeks and then breaking bad, I have realized I have become something of a hermit since most of my friends smoke.  I guess the point of this post is to see if there is anyone else out there who wants a quitting buddy to do healthy activities with or maybe just be there for neighbourly support.  Anywho, Good luck to all of you and keep up the good work!

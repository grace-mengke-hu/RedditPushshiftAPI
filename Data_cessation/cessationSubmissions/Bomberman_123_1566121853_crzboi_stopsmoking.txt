3-months cigarette free. Weed mixed with tobacco?

So, as the title suggests: I've been free from rollies for three months now. 

Yesterday I had the most intense urge in 3-months. I was feeling lonely, a bit down, and was walking at night; something I'd often do during my depression last year. Back then I'd be accompanied by my tobacco pouch, rolling paper and a lighter though. The tankstation is open 24/7, and I was really imagining how it would be to light one up again.

I'd the brains to realize I was feeling this way because I haven't been eating well the past 1,5 week, and hadn't even eaten anything that day (I've to travel to my sister's place to cook there, I'm not allowed to do so at home... And finding my own place is difficult here).  

Of course I'm gonna feel the urge to smoke when I don't feel well.

But I've also been smoking weed mixed with tobacco more often lately. I normally smoke less than once a month, and it's been 1 to 2 times a week now (holidays and stoner friends). Would it be wise to just drop the tobacco even in the joints I smoke? 

I've never felt the tobacco in a joint was giving me urges to smoke more, but maybe I'm just overestimating my ability for recognising my addictive behaviour. 

I ended up going home and ordered two pizza's instead, and watched a nice film then fell asleep instead. I'd probably have smoked again had I stayed outside for too long. Scary thought really.

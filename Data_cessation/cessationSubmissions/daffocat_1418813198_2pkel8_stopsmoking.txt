Almost done 3 months. Why am I seriously struggling?

I have almost done three months. For the last few days I have been so close to smoking. I am thinking about smoking constantly. I feel depressed and I haven't stopped crying yet today. Why is this happening? Why am I struggling so much? I am so fed up with feeling this way. I want the joy that other people who have stopped seem to have.

I’m 7 days away from 1 year....

I have always been the person who starts something and never sees it through, so this is a pretty big achievement!

I’ve survived multiple drinking sessions, stressful days at work and lots of boredom time. I’m not at the point where I will go a week without thinking of cigarettes and months between cravings. 

If I can do this, anyone can. 

Keep up the good fight friends :)

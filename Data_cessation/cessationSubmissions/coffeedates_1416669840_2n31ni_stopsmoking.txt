Hardly any withdrawal symptoms?

Hello, here's a quick background on the situation.

Quit smoking last year on Nov 23rd, 2013. I had the most fierce withdrawals. I was raging for nearly two months straight. It all went away and I stayed quit for nearly six months before relapsing in May 2014. 
Since then I had tried quitting multiple times without much luck. The longest quit I got was nine days and it was a struggle. Most quits lasted a day or two.

The plan was to quit smoking a few days before the anniversary of my big quit from last year. So I quit smoking on November 19th, 2014, but I don't think I've had a smoke since the 17th. I don't really remember.

I'm on day three right now. Where normally I would be a wreck, I'm feeling absolutely free. I think about cigarettes, but I don't feel bothered by not smoking. I have no urges to smoke. No physical symptoms. No anger, infact I feel overjoyed and excited by the fact I'm not smoking.

So what's going on? I know every quit is different, but maybe I just understand the addiction now after so many attempts?

I'll for sure keep my guard up. This is day three and it feels good man.

On to day four.

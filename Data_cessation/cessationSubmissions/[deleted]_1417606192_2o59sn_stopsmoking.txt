Hello!

Smoker for 25 years and ready to quit. My quit date is tomorrow, after I get paid and can buy some nicotine gum. I know from experience that cold turkey was too difficult for me, so I will try replacement therapy this time around. Please wish me lucky... I want to make it stick this time around. And yes, I just downloaded Allen Carr's book to begin reading today.

Thank you all for being here.

Anger, really unexpected and unreasonable anger

I'm not an angry person.  I keep it pretty calm, and my fuse is pretty long, at least until I quit smoking 2 months ago (ish).  I'd smoked up to a pack a day for 8 years and quit cold turkey, and I was fine for a while,  but now I'm near murder,  all the time. Anytime I put something in my hand I want to crush or throw it,  and I'm peoples biting heads off for asking questions I find irritating. I don't like being this person. I've been meditating,  cut down on caffeine,  long walks,  and I have a CA 215 card so I vape dry herbs.  It's not enough.  When will I chill?

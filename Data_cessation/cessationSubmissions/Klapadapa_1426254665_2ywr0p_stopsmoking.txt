I quit 3 weeks ago and today I realized I am not serious about it.

I quit cold turkey and I am happy about it. The "Smoke Free Beta" App I am using was very helpful, as well as the daily quests it is giving to me.
But today's quest made me questioning my motivation to quit once and for all.

It asks me to make a written contract with myself to never smoke again.
And I cannot do it.
I dont smoke anymore and I dont want to start again, but I am unable to write that down.
It seems to me, that I have the subconscious wish to smoke again "someday". I know that this wont work and that I will be back smoking a pack a day if I lit just one single cigarette.

What shall I do? I cannot sign that contract.
Does anyone have an advice for me?

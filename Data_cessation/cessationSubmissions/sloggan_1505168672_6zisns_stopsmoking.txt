Quit smoking. End of day 1

Ive been smoking for around 10 years, with some breaks in there..

Today I decided to quit this shit, and I did. Cold turkey as the call it. Gotta say its been hard the last 4 hours, but then I did something great. I decided to take a run, it motivated me to keep going! And when I got home my need for smoking kinda stopped. So one tip, go run a fast one if u really wanna smoke. 

Btw, the run was the fastest I've made in over a year ^_^

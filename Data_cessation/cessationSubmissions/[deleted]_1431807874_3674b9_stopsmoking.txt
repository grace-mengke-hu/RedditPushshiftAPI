Today's I set myself free to live the life I was born to earn.

Back again. Don't mind the badge (unless it shows one day). I'm broke again. And this time, without ado or flash or big celebration, I chain smoked my last 3, and quit. 3pm. Cigarettes have made me self-loathe for 8 years. I don't choose to spend the next 60 years of my life eroding myself physically, financially, and emotionally to end up like the poor old souls gasping for air in hospital beds. 

Thanks for reading, and thanks for simply existing, SS. Fight the good fights your mom gave birth to you for, not the lonely, chemical slavery that pays Mr. Marlboro's mortgage on his 4th home in the Hamptons.

Cheers!

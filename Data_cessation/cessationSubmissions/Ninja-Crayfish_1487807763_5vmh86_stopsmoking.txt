1 year and 1 month in: My mental struggles

Long post and I ramble on a lot so here goes


I quit smoking cold turkey near the end of January 2016 after being a smoker for 5 years and mentally it has been a rocky road.  Physically I feel great, who wouldn't (put on 10kgs but that's negligible) but in my mind I have struggled so many times. Heavy thoughts of relapsing have been common since my 2nd month. 

Me and my wife quit together, she had been a smoker for almost twice as long as me and I wasn't even a smoker when I first met her (nor did she get me into smoking). She had been planning to quit for a while due to her asthma and a change in financial circumstances was the final push that lead us to quitting (tax on cigarettes is very high in New Zealand and goes up annually). The easiest time in my quit was initially but from 2 months I had the first of many checkpoints which are nothing special and will be very familiar to many here. Going out with friends to a bar for the first time post quit etc. In fact majority of my closest friends are smokers. I work with some of my friends who are smokers. I haven't relapsed for two big reasons, for my wife and because I lost my father and uncle to heart (both in their late 40s) attacks 6 years ago, both were heavy smokers for 25 plus years. It would hurt my wife if I relapsed (we have talked about my feelings and struggles) she said she would be unsure If she could bear it and would maybe relapse herself and there's no way I want that burden on me after we have both done so well.

 I have thoughts of cigarettes and relapsing a lot during each week and mostly when I home and or alone. I have shitty dreams where I have relapsed. If you have read this far thank you I haven't exactly arranged this very well. To sum It all up I  feel had for having all these thoughts and feelings this far in when it seems like all the other successful quitters don't feel like me after a year and longer.

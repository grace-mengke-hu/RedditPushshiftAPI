100 Days Smoke Free!

So I've made it 100 days!  I have never made it this far before. My previous quit attempts have lasted anywhere from 3 days to 3 months.  I want to share what I've learned about quitting through my various quit attempts.  Everyone quits in at the very least slightly different ways, and so while this won't be applicable to everyone I hope it helps some people.

Days 1 to 3: **Anger.**  I would snap at anyone and everyone when I quit smoking.  I know now that I was unconsciously doing this in order to get people to tell me to get back to smoking.  That it seemed like I couldn't control myself without them.  When that failed I would turn to **triggers as an excuse.**  I would convince myself that I could quit later and that for now smoking after a meal, sex, or whatever else was just too good.

Days 4 to 7: **Despair.**  The triggers from driving to work, eating, and the constant nagging of withdrawal were getting to me.  I felt like the end of these feelings would never come.  I assure you that they do.  For me the physical withdrawal goes away within 2 weeks, sometimes 3.  It does come, but it takes  awhile.

Weeks 2 and 3: **Focus.**  I was so accustomed to smoking after completing tasks, focusing on a new task, trying to figure things out, whatever my job would require that without smokes I felt like I couldn't focus.  This has actually been there the whole time, but I feel its noteworthy to note it here because even after physical withdrawal ends this is still here.  Eventually this too fades, it just takes time to get into a new routine.  Since college I had mentally ingrained in myself the concept of rewarding myself after a mental task with a cigarette it took a while to get used to without it.  **Resentment.** For some reason right around this time (sometimes earlier) I would think about shitty things friends had done to me in the past, real and imagined slights, arguments with family, etc.  I would deal with bouts of anger.  I don't know where these come from.  I don't even quite know how to deal with them.  It still comes up on occasion but it passes after a while.  If anyone has any recommended ways to deal with this, or understand why this happens it would be appreciated.

Month 1 and 2: **Lack of Reward.** At this point my body feels recovered.  I don't feel that spark of energy in the morning (I know my body is much better off without the cigarettes, I think I've grow accustomed to my good health at this point and take it for granted).  This in turn lowers the rewards for quitting smoking in my mind, and it makes it a whole lot easier to slip.  I've even justified it by saying how much better I feel and that I can quit later.  It is also at this point that I am able to mentally work without cigarettes, and maybe I take this for granted as well.

So I ask you subscribers of /r/stopsmoking, what hurdles do I face in the future that I should avoid or work through.  What other thoughts do you have?  Also please share you're experiences so far.  I'd love to hear them.  Let's get through this together!

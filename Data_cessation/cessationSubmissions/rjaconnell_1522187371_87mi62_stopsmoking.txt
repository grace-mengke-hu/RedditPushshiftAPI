Needing some reassurance about quitting symptoms

Hi reddit, I suffer with terrible anxiety and experience depressive episodes too. Quitting is hard but so far I've managed a week. I've been getting these symptoms come up since I quit and it's making me very anxious. Does anyone suffer with any of the following after quitting? And how long does it last?

The feeling of a lump in throat
Difficulty swallowing
Difficulty breathing
The feeling of throat constructing
Apparent acid reflux
Aches and pains in abdomen
Breakout
Tired and fatigued
Unfocused and foggy
Bad anxiety developing into hypochondria

These symptoms have only appeared in the fee days after I quit, but need a little bit of encouragement and reassurance I'm not alone in symptoms like this. My anxiety tells me it's throat cancer or something equally deadly, but that's mental health problems for you. Im 23 and smoked for five years.

5 years - My QuitBuddy stats

[http://imgur.com/P8bzalu](http://imgur.com/P8bzalu). 
After smoking for 15 years, and several failed attempts to quit (once lasting up to 18 months), I have now gone without a smoke for 5 years.  
The best advice I can give is never give up on giving up. Each failed attempt is one step closer to giving up for good!  
The stats for the my QuitBuddy are calculated at 20 smokes per day averaged at 75c each (were 50c ea when I quit and now cost $1 ea). Not sure where all the cash is but I have certainly noticed the health benefits.  
Cheers :)

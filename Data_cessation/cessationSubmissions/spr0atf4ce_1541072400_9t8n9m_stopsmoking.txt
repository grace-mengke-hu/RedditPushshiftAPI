6 days in

I’m 6 days into not smoking and I’ve got a silly amount of energy and my mood is really good. I don’t know why but this feels like a concern, maybe because I’m not used to feeling this good. 

Anyone else get this? And will I end up crashing over the next few weeks?

Keep going everyone!!

Day 7 - will it get easier?

Honestly,  I tought the first few days would have been hard,  and they have,  but also that it would start to become easier after a week. 

I still crave it,  I still want it,  I still think "why keep going?" 

You quit cold for a whole week,  goody job!!  Now you should reward yourself with a nice smoke!!! 

That insane how damaged am I?? 

I really want it to work.  This is the first time in 20 years that I actually try and I don't know if I can make it. Right now it's working but I am afraid that as soon as something bad happens, I'll be right back in there because I am still thinking:"Why not?  What was so bad about it? "

FUCK!!!  Sorry for the rant..

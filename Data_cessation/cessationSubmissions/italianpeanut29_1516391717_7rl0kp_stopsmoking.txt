5th day being smoke free. Why am I so tired?

The last 2 Days I have been very lethargic. No energy, no motivation, nothing. I went to bed at 8:00 pm on Wednesday, 7:30 last night, and slept all the way to my alarm clock. How long does this last? Any tips to combat this? I also had to give up coffee as it was too much of a trigger and sent my cravings overboard. Think that has something to do with it?

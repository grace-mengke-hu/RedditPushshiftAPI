Feeling really shitty

TLDR: I'm quitting smoking and I had some MDMA from Friday night until Saturday morning. I'm feeling quite shitty and I don't know if it's because the molly or the lack of nicotine.

I was quite sick for a week, coughing, throat pain, even fever so I didn't smoke from Friday until Thursday next week. I went out last Thursday and Friday nights and I was smoking both nights and some cigarettes on Saturday. 

As I could make it one week with no smoking at all, even though lately I've been smoking around one pack per day, I said fuck it, I'm gonna quit, so I haven't smoked anything on Sunday or Today.

The thing is I feel quite shitty. I'm anxious, depressed, not sleeping well (I'm having nightmares, which I don't usually have), constipated... Fuck me, I usually only listen to gangsta rap and today I played some Ed Sheeran!!, I shit you not, at that moment I realised what was going on because that was not normal at all...

I checked and those are normal symptoms of withdrawal, but it's not the first time that I spend a few days without smoking and I don't remember feeling that bad ever.

The thing is on Saturday I had some MDMA, not even half a gram, but I'm not used to it and I know that it is normal feeling low the next day, so my question is if what I'm feeling is because of the MDMA or the cold turkey.

Long or short?

I wonder how y'all handle time. Are you looking at each hour/day smoke free or do you not count and just look forward? The quit smoking apps count every smoke-free second, but some books advise not having such a short vision, i.e., not concentrating on the time and instead focusing on the smoke-free-ness of life. An analogy was used by one author: It is like riding a bike. If you focus too much on the front tire, you will lose your balance. But if you look ahead, you won't fall off.

What works best? 

This will be my umpteenth quit since April. Each time, I feel pretty good, positive and determined. Then I smoke. Then I go through the seemingly common self-hatred, depression, etc.

I am tired of the quit-start yoyo and I don't want to fall off anymore.

Any advice on where I should set my sights is welcomed!

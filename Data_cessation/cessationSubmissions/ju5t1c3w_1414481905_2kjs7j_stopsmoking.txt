Cold turkey after 12 years need some help and tips to stay off

I started smoking when I was 12 with my older cousins. Been around smoking my entire life (parents, grandparents, aunt and uncles). But y'all all know how the world has turned against smoking to make it almost impossible to smoke anywhere. Work has put smoking at an auto termination offense. I have also noticed how much it is effecting my SO with her heath problems. She is still wanting me to not quit cold turkey afraid it will effect me badly like withdraw symptoms and is pushing me to vape or just trying to slow down first. I have been down these paths before and I always end back with a Marlboro in my hand. Are there any tips y'all can give me to help?

1 day - How can I stop trying to fool myself into buying cigs?

I stopped cold turkey yesterday, Saturday. My plan is to not only stop smoking but a complete change in my diet, as well as a new exercise program, starting tomorrow Monday. But for some reason, I started the "stop smoking" part yesterday.

So right now, the withdrawal is killing me and I'm **extremely close** to buy a pack, only for smoking today. 

In my mind I'm arguing: "Well tomorrow I'm changing so many things in my life. I deserve to go a bit crazy the night before"

What do you guys think? Part of me wants you to say: "If you're 100% sure you will manage to quit tomorrow, there's nothing wrong with one more day of smoking". Another part of me wants you to say: "If you buy a pack now, after deciding to quit yesterday, you will never be able to quit".

I'm such a mess right now.

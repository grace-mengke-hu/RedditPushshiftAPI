Fuck this.

I just had my last cigarette an hour ago. My brain keeps telling me that just like every other time, and i will succumb to my addiction. Well, fuck that. I turn twenty in three months and i refuse to be an addict anymore. I am excited for the withdrawels, they will teach me lessons that i can apply to the rest of my life. But I will need your help, because I have failed miserably in the past. Please tell me your stories, keep posting and upvoting even if you have fallen off track and I will do the same. Thank you for listening, please keep me in your thoughts.

It's like my senses are in HD

Yesterday was day 3, and according to my little quit smoking app thing, my taste and smell are back to normal. Boy is that true.
Yesterday I ate a strawberry and it was the juiciest, tangiest thing I've ever eaten. I never knew a piece of fruit could be so completely decadent. Then, when I got out of work, I could actually smell the city around me. I could smell the hot asphalt and the fast food places across the street and even the faint smell of the ocean a couple miles away. It may not have been a field of lilacs, but after years of dull odors, it was like a symphony. Never let me forget how good this feels, you guys, because I never want to go back.

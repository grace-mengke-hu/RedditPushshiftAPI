Quit four days ago

Hi all.

Just wanted to hand in my notice as well.

I had my last ciggie on Thursday before I went to bed. That makes it four days now with no smoke. I fucking want to smoke. So I went for a eight km walk instead. Been doing that a lot lately it seems. 

Anyways, wish me ~~luck~~ fortitude! This is it. After fourteen years, I'm done. I'm out.

One week

I've had a couple of days where I've missed smoking and even been sat in a friend's house while he smoked and just vaped as much as possible to stop me having one. 

Cutting down from 6mg to 3mg next week when I get paid if I'm still feeling as good as I am now. Only problem I'm having is I can't taste my e liquids that well but I've heard that happens. My husband said it did the same to him but it comes back eventually. Is it something to do with not having any cigs for a week now?

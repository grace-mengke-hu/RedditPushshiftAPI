Quitting my worst habit, again.

This is the second time I stop smoking. The first time, I started again after 3 years just because of my now ex-girlfriend. One year later, it's time to put it behind me once again. I quit cold turkey once and I'm doing it again. I'm having no problems because of my new lifestyle (losing weight, gaining muscle, keeping busy) and it's working out. (no pun intended)

This might sound clich√© but if I can do this, anyone can. You guys give me hope but I feel like I can give you hope aswel. I used to be weakwilled, I had a weak personality but even I can get over this addiction.

Here's to all of us, ex-smokers and smokers that struggle to quit alike! We can do this, it's worth it!

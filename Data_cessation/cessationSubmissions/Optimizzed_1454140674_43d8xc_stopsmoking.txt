sick or because I quit?

Yesterday, on day twelve of quit, I got the worst cough. Dry, deep, right from the lungs. It hurt to breathe as I went to sleep. Today I was coughing a bit and very tired. Tonight, the lung cough is back, however not as bad as last night. Should I go to a clinic? Or is this normal shitty quit stuff? I have tried to quit before and never had symptoms like this

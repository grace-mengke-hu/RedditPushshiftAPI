You guys are going to get tired of me...

I'm the classic case, actually started smoking daily when I moved to college, always told myself I'd quit, all those good things.  I had it nailed (I thought) for over a year, but some drama in my personal life brought me right back to it.

Fast forward about 6 months of only smoking at work and hiding it, more drama and here I am - the proverbial chimney.  It doesn't make me feel good, smell good, or set a good example for my son, but I'm having trouble with the anger/short temper when I go without for a few hours.

I know it has to be done, and I know it needs to be soon.  I've been lurking for awhile and really love the tone and support of the subreddit, and look forward to more of the same.  I'll hopefully have my "started the process" here in a few days, and look forward to joining the strong ones that have given it up for good.

So to you strong ones, I say: continue to set that great example for us, and thank you for all you do.

To those of you on the same side as me: Please, reach out if you'd like and we can chat about it.  It never hurts to have others in the same place and push each other.  At the very least, good luck to you!

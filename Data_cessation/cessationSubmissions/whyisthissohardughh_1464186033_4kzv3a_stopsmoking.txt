This is finally the beginning of the end

For the last year i have been trying to quit. and i have been, on and off of course. well today i officially put in the request to have my badge reset. i have been smoke free for about 60 hours. i have absolutely no desire to smoke and it is amazing. i have been taking a well known drug called wellbutrin or bupropion for a couple months now and just decided that enough was enough. its a waste of money, i fell super sick after every single cigarette and i shared one last smoke with my husband and haven't touched one since. i feel happier, my lungs already feel better and its just wonderful. now a question for those on this medicine... do have weird dreams? and do you feel extra pain or extra tense muscles after being on this for a little while? because this is happening to me and the dreams are vivid. i'm scared to death of spiders but i keep dreaming of a big ass wolf spider that has set up home in my car. im too afraid to actually travel out to my car to look lol but yeah. thank you for reading this and any feed back is completely welcome!

Looking for some help

I had a really tough day today. Fought with a couple colleagues. Made a few blunders. Did not eat the whole day. Worked straight for 12 hours.

When I reached home I broke down in tears.  I have had such days a few times but I have never cried because of work before. Can I just think of it as an outcome of quitting smoking or is it some other emotion/ thought that's messing me up..

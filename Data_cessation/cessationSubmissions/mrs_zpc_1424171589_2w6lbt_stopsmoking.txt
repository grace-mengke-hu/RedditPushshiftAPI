Day one, take three.

Here I am again. I've reset my badge.

I read a post from another user. I found it inspiring. She had been quit for some time and gave in to have one cigarette.

Just one.

And she didn't want another. 

I found one of the other responses to have a rather negative tone and so I decided I'd try and help them pick themselves back up...

As I typed away with my cigarette in my hand.... doling out quit advice.... what a joke.

How stupid am I!?

I know I can do this! I've done it before! The only person responsible for my quitting is me. And I need to pull my head in and get on with it. I have all the tools and all the support. I just needed to remember why I'm quitting. 

For one. I feel like shit. I wake up and my lungs are raw. Sometimes I feel like someone is sitting on my chest. 

My husband and I are trying for a baby. I've got some funny shit going on with my cycle and I know smoking isn't helping. Neither is my weight.

I lost my mum to lung cancer at the age of 58. Fuck. How much more motivation do I need.

I promised myself to be smoke free by the 12th of March. I'm going to get there this time. 

I feel a sadness. The thought of giving up smoking feels like I am abandoning an old friend. I feel a loss and an emptiness just at the very thought of it. I hop my new friends salad and cardio will come to my party!

Join me in not smoking (ever again).

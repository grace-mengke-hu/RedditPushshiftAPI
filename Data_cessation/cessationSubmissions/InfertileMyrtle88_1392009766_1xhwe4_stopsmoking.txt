Just looking for a little inspiration....

I am 5 days out.....I am having a terrible time focusing. I just want to go bum one from a neighbor. I've always been a repeat offender of smoking a couple of cigarettes a week...but as we all know it's hard to keep that up...eventually it will always turn into more. I've been hiding my smoking from my husband for a very long time, threatened with dire consequences if I sustained my habit.

So...I smoked my last cigarette 5 days ago. I feel like I lost a friend. I'm having difficulty today especially. I'm not...cranky like "IF I DONT GET A CIGARETTE ILL KILL SOMEONE" but...cranky as if...I'm mad. Because this isn't really my choice, I'm choosing to quit because I'm tired of lying to my husband and hiding it from him. Mad because I'm 25 and should be able to make this decision for myself. Ultimately, obviously, I know it's a good one. And it is something I want in the abstract. But right now...I'm drinking a lot of water...chewing a lot of gum...and snacking WAY too much.

Any encouraging words, y'all?

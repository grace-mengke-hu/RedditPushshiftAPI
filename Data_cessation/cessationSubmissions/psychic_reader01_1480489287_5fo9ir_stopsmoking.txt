My psychic abilities told me to get help from you guys...

Well, not really, but I need help and entertainment and this place looked like the good spot for it. I can't really bother most other forums with my agony. 

I have anxiety-related smoking patterns, and when I feel anxious, I think I need cigarettes to not panic. I smoke quite a lot.

I thought to quit, and I'd like to quit TODAY, but I'm not sure I can manage. Would you cheer on me for a few days? I'll give you a free psychic reading for the effort, if you have simple questions, that is. I'll probably not be very connected to the aether while withdrawing, so I anyway cannot guarantee for the outcome. But ask away, for your own amusement or for actual help, doesn't matter. I would just like the company while going into this, and if I can help you or entertain you or amuse you while I get company, all the better. The world needs more fun. :)

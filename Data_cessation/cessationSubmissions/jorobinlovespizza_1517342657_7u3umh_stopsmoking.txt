The hardest thing is filling up all that extra time. Suggestions?

I quit for 14 days and then fell back in it.

Figuring out what to do with all this extra time is so hard.

I've been smoking for 22 years. I'm 35 now and I don't want to smoke anymore.

My personality is pretty compulsive and I do fine not smoking when I'm with my SO and at work since no one smokes there but when I'm home in my days off or at the bar I always back out.

What do y'all do to stay distracted in those compulsive moments?

How do you train yourself into other tactics for dealing with emotions?

Thanks in advance team.

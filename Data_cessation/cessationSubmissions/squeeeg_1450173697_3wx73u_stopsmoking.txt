Starting day 5

I have been thinking for a while it was time to quit.  I just never pulled the trigger.  My local gas station always had then waiting for me when I checked out.  Tomorrow always seemed like a better day.  

Well 5 days ago I smoked the last one in my pack.  I didn't feel like going to the store at 4am so I feel asleep without any smokes in my house.  Woke up and just didn't go to the store.   Kinda realized it was a good time to try.   The cravings are getting fewer but just as intense.  

All the typical symptoms.  Withdrawals, irritability, anxiety, all of it. I told my gas station I didn't need them anymore and they are supporting me.  Next I'm going to need to quit trident gum.  But I think that'll be a walk in the park compared to smoking. 

Thank all of you for being here and helping through the Internet.  It's nice not too feel alone

Thinking about buying cigarettes...

I stopped smoking  8 days ago and all I want to do right now is to get some cigarettes. 

How do you handle the urge for cigarettes?  
The last week was hard but I had a lot of people around to support me - now I’m alone feel kind of stupid. I know that the cigarettes won’t taste good, i won’t be able to enjoy them but still I feel the need to smoke.

7 weeks in! Best 10K ever

Hey guys

I've been on this forum on and off for the last few weeks as I try to quit. I also decided to run a half marathon as a celebration of quitting. I just ran my best 10K time ever: 1 hr 4 minutes! 

It's a huge accomplishment for me as I never was able to finish a 5K before without having to stop and walk part of it. I half walked half ran a half marathon earlier this year posting an abysmal 2.37 (some people can run an entire marathon in that time) so I decided to really try and get my act together this time. I don't know if it's the want to do better, the quitting smoking or something else but I've never had such a good run ever before. Also as a byproduct of quitting, I also drastically cut back on the drinking which I think is a contributing factor as well. 

I have no wisdom to offer, just wanted to share my experience and joy!

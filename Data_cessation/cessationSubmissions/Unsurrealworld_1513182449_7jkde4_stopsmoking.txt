After years of chipping, finally went back to full time smoking. Must quit.

I've smoked somewhat consistently for about 14 years. Quit several times for a few months, once a whole year. For the past 5 years, I got into a somewhat better habit than daily smoking and just smoked cigs on the weekends mostly while drinking. Not sure how I did that for so many years. 

Long story short, after a week long vacation, coming back to getting a divorce, and working at a home every day, I slid back into smoking full time about 6 weeks ago. I can feel the difference in my body when comparing smoking on the weekend to all the time. My circulation is terrible, feet freezing constantly, can't taste anything. I have to stop before this goes any further. Going to do cold turkey this time- want this shit out of my system as fast as possible. I threw my pack away last night and have almost made it to lunchtime today! Not in too bad shape yet. Thought about this hard yesterday and I think I just have to quit drinking for these first few weeks because that has always been my downfall literally every time I started back in the past. Booze isn't doing me any favors anyway with all the other bullshit going on in my life. Gonna be a fun week! Wish me luck.

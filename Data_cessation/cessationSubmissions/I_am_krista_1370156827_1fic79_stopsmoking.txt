Right now I am putting out the last cigarette I will ever smoke.   I have an ecig I will be puffing on occasionally,  with the goal of zero nicotine by my birthday,  June 26, which is non coincidentally the day I am starting presenting full time as a female.  (I'm transgender).

Wish me luck!  Now I have a future I actually care about,  *I can do this!*

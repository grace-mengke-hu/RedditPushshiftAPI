Day 3 - cold turkey.

Alright folks. Today is day 3 for me, going cold turkey. Been having an average of about 30 smokes a day for a good 20 years now. More in a day if I'm drinking.

Still sustaining cravings. Hoping not to slip :(

I've tried patches, gum and Alan Carr before, nothing helped. This time, it's just willpower. 

What do you guys think? What's the hump time by when it gets more manageable?

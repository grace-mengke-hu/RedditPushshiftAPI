Woah. I hit a whole month.

Well.  I made it this far.  It feels good.  Aside from waking up every morning with pain in my chest, I feel much better than before.

I have been in a lot of possible situations that would make me want to smoke.  Long drives, being around big crowds of strangers I have to socialize with, etc.

The only thing left is to be offered a cigarette by a smoker and give myself the chance to say no.  Then I will say no, and that will be my final test.  Unless I have a kid someday.  I'm sure that could drive an ex-smoker back to the cig.  But not me!

Edit - I forgot to mention that 33 days flew by without my even really realizing it.

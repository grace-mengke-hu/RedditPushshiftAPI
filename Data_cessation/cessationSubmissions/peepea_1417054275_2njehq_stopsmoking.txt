Quitting again.

Smoker for a decade here.

So for the past 2 years, I have quit smoking so many times. I've even gone a few months without smoking. I really want to quit for good because heart disease runs in my family (mom died of a heart attack at 40), and I'm also on birth control which could makes smoking even more dangerous for me. Keeping my youthful appearance would be nice too. I have set a permanent a few years ago to quit by the time I turn 30. That is coming up this February.

Here's my problem with relapsing. I work offshore, and can easily not smoke out there. As soon as I hit land, I want a ciggie. It's not just when I drink, although the urge is even stronger then. 

I am currently 6 days tobacco free. I had gotten sick, so I stopped smoking. I am offshore now, and will be going home in a week. Other than not drinking, what are some things that could help me quit for good. I know it is all mental for me. I've gone through the quitting process so many times, I don't even notice withdrawals. 

Thanks for reading.

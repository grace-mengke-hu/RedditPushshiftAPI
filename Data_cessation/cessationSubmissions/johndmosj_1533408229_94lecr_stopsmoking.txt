Why do I feel like asshole when I smoke cigs?

I quit for a while and started back up and ever since I feel like straight up asshole....

I get headache feeling and my heart rate constantly is beating faster when I smoke and feel slightly harder to catch my breath at times...

Anyone know why this is?

Thank you.

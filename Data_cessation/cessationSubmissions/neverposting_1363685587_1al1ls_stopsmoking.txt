Day 1 but feeling strong and confident and need some tips.

Yesterday I smoked my last cigarette. I feel strong and confident but I need some advice. Can you please share the one thing that helped you the most adjusting to life without smoking? When I was bored I would smoke so I really need your advice. Thanks!

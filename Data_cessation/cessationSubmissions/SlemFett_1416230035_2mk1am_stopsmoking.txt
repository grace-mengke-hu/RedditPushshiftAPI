Costant state of withdrawal

So past me quit smoking 3 months ago, after having used nicotine in diffrent forms for over 25 years. My quit-app says that I have not smoked 1800+cigarettes and saved a lot of money. However I have caved three times and smoked a total of 30 cigarettes at 3 occations (while drunk). This has put in me in a constant state of withdrawal. But present me forgive my past self for that. 

To give my best buddy future me the best christmas gift ever, I will not smoke or use nicotine in any form so that he can have a great healthy happy holiday and feel proud of past me without having to forgive that guy for all the pain he put me through.

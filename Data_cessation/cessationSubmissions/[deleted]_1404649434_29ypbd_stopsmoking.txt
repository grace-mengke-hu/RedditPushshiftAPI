The smoking dream, does anyone else wake up feeling guilty because of it?

I had one again last night, woke up and for a minute or two felt like I had totally screwed up. Then as my brain slowly started waking up, I realized it was just a dream. Still, for a couple of minutes, I felt like a bag of shit.

Stupid addiction riddled brain.

What is wrong with me?

I tried to come up with a better, more explanatory title but couldn't put it in a sentence. Sorry! (English isn't my first language)

Firstly, I'm over a hundred days in and its been great so far except for this thing.

Since the past few days I've started to crave "certain" cigarettes. You know the cigarette after a long flight/train, the one you smoke out in the rain while everyone's inside. Or the one you where you shouldn't be smoking. These cigarettes were the ones that were the most rewarding and the ones that caused the most trouble to get to.

Let me give you an example. Yesterday, I was on an overnight bus and it had stopped for a while at about 3AM. I stayed in and saw someone light up and immidiately I had the worst craving ever. I almost made up my mind to smoke but fortunately the bus started before I could take things further. This has been happening many times.

I find this very weird, I should happy I don't have to smoke in such situations but I feel the opposite. What is happening? I have everything else under control except for this.

Smoking not only almost killed me, it may have killed me in the end.

I mentioned last week that I just got out of the hospital, and went to the Doc today.   Turns out I may have COPD, and have to remain on the Oxygen. It's fine when sitting (94ish) but as soon as I stand and walk around it drops to 85ish...   I can't help but feel my life is over, just because I had to have one cig, and then another, and then another.    

Please Quit smoking now while you can if you haven't..  Been a week and half without now....

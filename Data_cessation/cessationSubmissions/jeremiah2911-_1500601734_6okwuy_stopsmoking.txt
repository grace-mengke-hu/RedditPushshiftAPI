Tomorrow is the big day

Good Evening Family. Tomorrow is the day I quit smoking cigarettes. My wife and I quit together 2 yrs ago but I started again. I've always felt ashamed of that. But, I'm retaking the plunge tomorrow. 

I have had a lot of luck with leaning on the forums on Reddit when it comes to my struggles. I'm stoked a forum like this exists. 

I will be checking in tomorrow, thank you all for being here

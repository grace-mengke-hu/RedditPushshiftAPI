I can't even start

Hey guys.
I have a problem. I really really want to stop smoking. I hate that I am a slave. I hate that I can't breathe sometimes. I hate the Way my skin looks. I'd say my biggest problem is that i have build up rutines so tight over the years. I smoke ca. 3 cigarettes with coffee every single morning since 5 or 6 years. I can't imagine myself without it.
I quit some Times for 2-3 weeks. Recently every attemp to stop didn't last longer than 3 hours. I am driving myself insane. I cannot go past a day . It just seems impossible. I really don't know how i should ever manage it to quit those gross things. I really Need some help here. 
Thanks

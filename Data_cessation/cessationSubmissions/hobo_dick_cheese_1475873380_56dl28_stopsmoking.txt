Litany against cigs.

I must not smoke.

Cig is the lung-killer.

Nicotine is the little-death that brings total obliteration.

I will face my cravings.

I will permit them to pass over me and through me.

And when they have gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path.

Where the cravings have gone there will be nothing.

Only I will remain.

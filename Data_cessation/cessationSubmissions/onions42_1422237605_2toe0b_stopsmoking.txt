would today be a good day?

So Ive been smoking since I was about 12, I'm now 20. I am up to about a pack and a half a day. I have tried to quit before, my friends who all smoke made it hard to drop the habit for more then a day. My father was recently diagnosed with colon cancer, almost every member in my family that has died in the last 10 years has been due to cancer. I think its time but I need some support. I love you guys and your quitting stories, and I hope you guys can help me write my own. Thank you

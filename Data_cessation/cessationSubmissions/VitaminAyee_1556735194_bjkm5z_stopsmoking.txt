Been a rough two weeks.

She left me 2 weeks ago and I started smoking like never before and that's saying something since I've smoked for 8 years. 

Days are finally looking better and I'm looking to quit after this pack. 

Life is too short for me to make it any shorter and cling on to what could have been.

Cheers my friends; expect a day 1 quitting post when I come to it :)

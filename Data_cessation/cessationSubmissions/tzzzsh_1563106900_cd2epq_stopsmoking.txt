Any and all tips for quitting

It has been a few months since my last attempt and I'm ready to stop killing myself.

I have 8 cigarettes and a July with no pods.
I'm on vacation until the 18th and so there is no work stress to worry about and I would really like to return to my wife smelling like anything other than cigarettes.

What has worked for you? What hasn't? What has been the cause of your relapses? Are there other support groups you recommend?

Thank you all and stay healthy!

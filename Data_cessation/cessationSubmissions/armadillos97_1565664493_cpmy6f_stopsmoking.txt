Until I post this, I won't know exactly how many days it's been.

My partner's cigarettes smell so much stronger now. We took a bath together. He brought weed and a pack of cigarettes like normal. I was nearly gagging. I smell it on his skin, and I used to smoke way more than he ever did. 

The mood swings are improving. I used the money I saved to get back on my ADHD meds. (Fun fact: nicotine is a stimulant and many people are self medicating ADHD with cigarettes.) I went to my first class at a college campus today that is tobacco free. Simply reading that sign used to fill me with guilt and knowing I smoked contributed to shame that held me back. I borrowed a book from the library and I know that I'm not going to make it stink. I talked to my mom on the phone without smoking 5-7 cigarettes. (Moms are often long winded.) 

Currently, quitting smoking is the biggest accomplishment I've had in awhile. I think I'm starting to break a habit of learned helplessness.

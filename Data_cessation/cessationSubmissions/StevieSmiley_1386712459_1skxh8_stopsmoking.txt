Just stopping in to see how long I've been a non smoker.

52 days wow! Anyway I also have a small story to share, or maybe 2 , who knows!

I don't go to stores very often other than the local grocery store. But today was a bit different. I was sent to a different more common type of shopping center much like walmarts. So I was browsing around looking for this item unsuccessfully but there were so many different smellies and suddenly Boom. it was like i teleported through 30 years of time to feel like a kid being lost in a grocery center. I found it quite exhilarating. I walked around for a little longer but decided i better leave before I went into the toy isles.

On the way out some lady asked if I smoked and I joyfully stated "oh no. I quit a month ago. Sorry! :) "

and went on my way.

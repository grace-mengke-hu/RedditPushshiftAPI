New and last try

I’ m now one day nicotine free,  and I tried many times and failed. I have never been a heavy smoker, 6-10 cigs a day, a pack when i drink alcohol at the weekend. Social smoker i would say. But I’m aware of my addiction and I spent last 10 years smoking stupid cancer sticks. In my country cigarettes are so cheap and 40% people smoke. I dont wanna be part of that society.

"Sorry, I don't smoke!"

I went clubbing on Saturday night, and went out into the smoking area to try and find my mates. As usual, somebody came up to me and asked for a cig, but rather than reaching for my pocket, or rather coming up with the "sorry, I don't have any" excuse, I found myself saying "sorry, I don't smoke!" 

Definitely felt weird hearing myself say it, especially after smoking for seven years (since the age of 18), but damn, that shit felt good!

Six weeks in and still going strong.. cheers.. and stick to your guns!

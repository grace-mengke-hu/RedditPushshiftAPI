Am I so week or what ?

1 year and 9 months ago I've started the battle to quit smoking. I've got accepted in an engineering school and I wanted some change. The first day I've quit and after only 4 hours and I started having something I'll call "impulsive thoughts" about how quitting cigarettes will be hard for me. I wasn't only thinking it I was feeling aswell. So I didn't succeed quitting smoking.

Withing almost 2 years I've tried multiple solutions : hypnosis, e-cigarettes, patches, gums...

&amp;#x200B;

I've also tried the allen carr DVD/Book/Session (multiple times) but I barely quit only for 20 hours and I've failed at 8:00 PM. The day was fine and I didn't have any withdrawals but once I got into my house I've starting thinking about it and thus I've ran to the tobacco store to buy packs of cigarettes.

&amp;#x200B;

I've tried quitting cold turkey multiple times and I the sad funny truth is that I can't seem to be able to quit for more than a few hours straight before finally the cravings hits and just surrender.

&amp;#x200B;

Am I the only one experiencing this ?   
How to solve this issue ?  
What am I doing wrong ?  
Does this mean I'm ignorant about the quitting process ?  
What should I do ?  


Thanks

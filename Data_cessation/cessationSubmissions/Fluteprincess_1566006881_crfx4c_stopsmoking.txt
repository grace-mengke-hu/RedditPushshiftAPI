I think i'm free now

I've been smoking for 3 years. I have already had thyroid cancer and was afraid of getting more cancer, so i know i needed to stop... It started as just being cool with my friends and then me developing that addiction that I was so afraid of catching.. But now, I am happy to say that with the help of my boyfriend I think i am not addicted anymore. its been a month now with no smoking except for one last week and one today. He got me some nicotine mints and patches a week ago, before i have just gone cold turkey quitting.. It was really hard to not want them, but he let me talk about them and how much they used to give me a buzz. I tried one of my most favorite cigarettes earlier today and it did nothing for me but taste gross.  I still have that pack, I keep it because its my "if i need it emergency", but so far I don't think i will be needing them. I think that if i am responsible enough to hold it, then i have more power to me. If you like menthols, try eating a mini nicotine lozenge and a regular mint at the same time, it tastes good and trains your mouth to like that taste better than the menthol cigarette(:

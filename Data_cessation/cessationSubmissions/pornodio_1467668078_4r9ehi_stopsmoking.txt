Beautiful tan after quitting smoking

this is my first summer as a non smoker after 10 years.

I still have to tan right, I have mediterran traits so I naturally tan very well but I'm white the rest of the year. But the effects are really cool after just a few hours a week at the sun.

After 10 years of smoking, I had forgot what it means to have a beautiful tan skin. All these years as a smoker I used to get a pathetic reddish-like tan which disappeared in a few days, turns out it was all sun-erythema and that my melanocytes had stopped functioning right. Also, I was white as a mozzarella under the shirt.

Had a BIG win in terms of quitting yesterday!!

So part of the reason I became almost a pack-a-day smoker before I quit for good was because of the insane amount of stress in my life. I had an extremely stressful day yesterday, and had my worst craving for a cigarette since quitting. And instead of smoking, know what I did? Worked out. I ran for about 20 minutes. I wasn't close to caving and buying cigarettes, but after I ran, I thought to myself how much better of a stress coping mechanism that was than sitting in my car and sulking and smoking. It felt so good to do that!!!!

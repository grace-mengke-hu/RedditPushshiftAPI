Succumbed after ~300 days smoke free

I just needed a place to vent, to share.  
I had been 100% smoke free for ten months, I had gone from a pack-a-day to 0 after a sudden decision to just stop.  
Recently, I smoked a joint with friends (had been weed-free for more than a year) because I thought I could handle it and it seems I can handle weed but the tobbacco was a problem.

Well, today, I smoked my first cigarette in ten months. Shit.  
Luckily, I didn't buy my own, but bummed a cigarette off of someone.  
Right now, I just wish I can put the demon back into the box.

Please wish me luck, I am sure you all know and can appreciate how hard it is.

Really, the only viable strategy is to always stay vigilant!

Edit: Thanks for the encouragment! I'll look at it as a slip-up, learn from it and continue on my path. The smoke-free life **is** so much nicer!

180 days. 180 turn around.

I can't believe it, but I've been 180 days smoke free (with one minor, drunken infraction). 

I've done a 180 on smoking. Used to believe I would never quit, and then that I'd never be able to quit. But here I am, and I feel great. 

I quit, despite having a huge amount of stress in my life. I quit, despite being in a near-death car accident less than two months after starting my quit. I quit despite being surrounded by friends who smoke (thankfully my wife doesn't). I quit, despite smoking for more than 20 years! 

If you're quitting and you're struggling, know that there's a light at the end of the tunnel. Hang in there. It WILL get better and easier. 

Thanks to those on this sub who provided both inspiration and support. You guys and gals are great. Thanks!

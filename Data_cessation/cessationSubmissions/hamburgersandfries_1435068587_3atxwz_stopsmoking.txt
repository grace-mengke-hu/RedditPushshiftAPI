1 month anniversary today after quitting cold turkey!

hello everyone.

I started smoking cigs back in 1998 while serving in the US Navy. I turn 35 on Friday and last month on the 23rd I told my gf that i was about to smoke my last cigarette. 

she didnt believe me of course because i had said it before but i felt different this time.

Despite claiming that i had wanted to quit a million times over the years, i never truly felt like i was done until that day.

you see, your attitude has a huge effect on how it pans out.

Im not gonna sit here and preach to you guys but i will say this - I have been in bars, drinking and around smoking friends thoughtout the past 31 days and i never came close to giving in.

I never once said, "i need or want one" instead i reminded myself how gross and destructive they are. I said "I don't want a cigarette cause if i did I wouldnt be trying to quit".

It feels good and i believe in every one of you who truly has had enough. For those who have, you can do it.

For those who cant stop, you simply arent there yet. Dont beat yourself up. Go through what you must to be where you want but remember that ultimately you are a human with a big brain and a bunch of will power. Positive energy creates positive energy and negative energy will bring negative energy. You are what you put into the world.

I am not a smoker any more. How about you?

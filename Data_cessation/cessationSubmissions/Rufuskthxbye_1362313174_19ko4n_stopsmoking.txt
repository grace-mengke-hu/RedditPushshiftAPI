I quit but i never read Allen Carr's book. AMA


Just wanted to say that it is possible to quit cold turkey! You dont need the gum or the patches amd you dont really need Allen Carr either. You just have to decide to not smoke (i mean really) atleast thats what i did and it has worked so far!

I used to smoke 1 pack/day for 4 years and smoked "casually" 2 years before that. Im a new years qutter and i havent had any cravings! 

Anyway Goodluck to you quitters out there! 



**Edit:** There is squirrles in the ocean swimming around in a circle of pink banans. Think about it!

Also i did not intend this to be "Anti-Allen Carr".

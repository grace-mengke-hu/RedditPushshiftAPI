Quitting smoking after an accident

After I was in an accident a few weeks ago where I had collapsed lung, I had to stop smoking. I had actually wanted to stop - and even tried before, but it never lasted for more than a few days. The accident forced the issue. And it was for the best. 

Now, I'm coming up on 30 days and in the past two days I've started to get my strongest urges yet. I'm really happy I've made it this far. I feel better than I have in a long time and I don't want to go back to smoking - but it is really difficult. 

So many posts recommend exercise, but after my accident, even walking is difficult. What else can I do to keep my mind off these urges?

Considering switching to e-cigarettes because of very sore throat after parties, will it help?

So I am still smoking, and as of now, I don't plan on stopping completely, although I would like to find a "healthier" alternative. So I am asking those of you who switched from regular to e-cigarettes; does it ease the throat burn experienced after heavy smoking at parties? Right now I go through about a pack at a party, and I have about 2-3 weeks of constant parties starting today, and I would really like to overcome this problem as much as possible.

Thank you in advance.

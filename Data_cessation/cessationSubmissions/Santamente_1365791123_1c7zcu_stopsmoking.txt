Singers / Ex-Smokers - How Did You Keep Your Voice When Quitting?


not sure if this will get many responses, but worth a shot. i've been smoking off an on for sixteen years now, and have quit / tried to quit multiple times, moreso over the past six years. but here's the point where it always derails me. i've been vocalist in a band for the past eight years, and my voice is very gravely/screamy - punkish tom waits. when i quit smoking, like clockwork, i lose my range about three weeks in, and most of my gravel within a month. and then a few shows in i'll end up smoking just before shows to keep my voice, and then a few months later i'm back to a pack or two a day. changing my vocal style is not an option with this much time behind the band, so i'm stumped. any other former smokers / singers that have had to deal with this? i really want to quit, but this has continually been a dealbreaker.

Day 1 Report

Been trying to quit smoking. This time I've made it a whole day. I just took some melatonin and am about to pass the fuck out, but I thought I'd share how I made it through the day.

1. I didn't hang out with smokers. Two of my friends came over that usually smoke, but *somehow* they were out tonight, thank goodness. I even asked for one, bleh, but they were out. I noticed when I asked for a cigg, there was an intense feeling to smoke. I didn't think I would survive it, lol. But 20 minutes later I noticed I had passed it.

2. FOOD! I went out and bought a bunch of groceries, and I've been eating like crazy. When I smoke ciggs I usually forget to eat half the time, so today I have been eating like crazy.

3. I took breaks on my patio where I used to smoke, either to eat or smoke a bowl. This gave me that "ahh, outside on my patio" feeling that I felt like I kept needing throughout the day.

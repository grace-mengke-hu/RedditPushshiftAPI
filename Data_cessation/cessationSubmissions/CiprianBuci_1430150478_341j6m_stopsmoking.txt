It's been 7 days now.

I quit smoking on 4/19/2015. I smoked for about 6 years. Don't drink alcohol and exercise until you're so tired you have to go sleep. I found doing it this way was much easier than other methods. I also ate fruit every time i got a craving. Apples were the most helpful. Don't have any cravings and even had a few glasses of wine last night and its wonderful.
Edit: I'm also saving around $75.00/month. I can throw in an extra $10.00 and take boxing classes for an entire month.

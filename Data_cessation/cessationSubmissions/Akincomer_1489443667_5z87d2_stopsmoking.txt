Quit 3 days ago

Hello fellow quitters.  I quit cigs 3 days ago (cold turkey) after smoking a pack a day for 13 years.  

The first 3 days weren't too bad for me because my gf was over for the weekend and we had a stress free fun packed weekend.

She is now gone and the anxiety is strong.  I am constantly chewing stuff and shaking my legs.  My head feels a bit fuzzy/dimwitted and I get small headaches here and there.  I am trying to drink lots and lots of water.  

I am astounded by how much of my yearning to smoke comes from boredom.  I knew that I smoked in the key events of daily routine such as, waking up, after eating, pooing, after sex, when stressed with work, and etc.  But I am currently just sitting here trying to minimize stress as much as possible, and I think, "fuck i'm bored, i want a cig."

Anyways, I guess I just wanted to diary entry something somewhere...

I do have a question though.  Is it not recommended for me to go buy a vape pen with 0 nicotine oil?  I kinda want an analog to smoking, but wondering if its gonna make me just wish for cigs more.  Any experience on the matter guys? 

Thanks.

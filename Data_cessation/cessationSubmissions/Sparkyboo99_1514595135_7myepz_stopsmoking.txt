4 months (and 2 days)!

I’m out with my smoking friends tonight and will need support! I’m inside alone while they stand outside in the frigid cold.  There is no way I will let my craving break this solid four months of being smoke free! I’m so grateful to be smoke free. Looking forward to a completely smoke free 2018!

4 weeks

Just sharing what I think  my best achievement, 15+ years smoking half to full pack a day, last year I tried for 12 consecutive weeks loosing my grip every weekend, if I could give any day 1 quitter an advice I'll say water, loads of water... The wierd thing that i didn't get any hard cravings only loss of energy, barely can walk but I guess my addict brain is playing with me. Thank you all for your encouraging as well as helpful posts and replies.

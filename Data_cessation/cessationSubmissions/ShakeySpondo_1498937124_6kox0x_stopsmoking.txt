Almost 3 weeks, sudden resurgence of strong cravings

Ugh, I'm on day 20 of my cold turkey quit.  The weather is beautiful, I've had a couple beers, and suddenly my cravings are just like day 1!  

This is my 2nd serious quit attempt, the first time I went nearly 2 years nicotine free (I'm an idiot and relapsed), so I know I'm almost over the hump.  Encouragement to keep buzzed me from doing something stupid would be appreciated!

39 Days since i quit! Weird Dreams

Holy crap those first few weeks sucked but with the help of the patch  I think I'm in the clear now, can't walk past smokers now without thinking "holy crap I used to smell like that!?!?" Ive been having a lot of very vivid smoking dreams tho, I usually wake up feeling stressed and guilty. Anyone else?

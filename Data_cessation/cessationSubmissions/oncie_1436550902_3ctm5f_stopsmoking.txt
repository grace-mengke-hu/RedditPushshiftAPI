almost 2 weeks, Don't fret though. if you just quit it will get easier.

I know it doesn't seem like much but god it feels like it's been a year honestly. 

if you are just quiting stay with it. PLEASE. I had been smoking since i was 17(almost 22 now) i was smoking around 12-16 cigs a day. My first few days sucked so bad. day 3 and 7 where my worst so far. i just wanted to post this to let you new quiters know that the anger and zoning out, the dazed feeling you have through the day goes away and i promise it does get better.

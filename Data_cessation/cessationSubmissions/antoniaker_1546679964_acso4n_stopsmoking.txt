Quitters Flu?

Hello all i am on day 5 and my non smoking app told me to join this community as my daily challenge so here I am ;) 
I am actually feeling super horrible - feverish, headache, muscle pain, sore throat, cough. I read this is called quitters flu - is anyone else suffering?? 
Might also be that I’m a bit hard on my body at the moment because in addition to the cigarettes I also cut the CRAP on top (caffeine - refined sugar - alcohol - processed food)..
Any advice on how to deal with this „flu“ is very much appreciated :)

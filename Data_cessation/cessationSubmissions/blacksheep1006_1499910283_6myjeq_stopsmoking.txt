The cravings are real when you're anxious (day 8)

On day 8. Using my vape pen like it's going out of style. While it's a good anxious my anxiety is up today. Fiance has been presented a couple opprotunities, all good but the unknown and change gets my anxiety worked up. Which causes me to stress which gives me cravings. I'm not going to cave but for the love of all things crispy and deep fried this is a hard day. Hopefully no one else is struggling today, but if you are know you're not alone. 

Thanks for listening to my woes lol

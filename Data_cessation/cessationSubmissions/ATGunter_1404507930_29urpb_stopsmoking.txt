Made it to 32 days and fell for the social smoking trap.

I went 32 straight days without smoking. I saved up enough money to purchase the mechanical keyboard I wanted to buy and then I ended up falling for the social smoking trap. I've been trying to quit again for the past 3 days and it's fucking awful. My mood swings are intense, I get pissed off at every little thing and it feels like I no longer have control over my emotions and I just can't help it. I had an anxiety attack watching Flight because I know how it felt like to have an addiction and falling back into it after doing so well and committing to quitting. I can't seem to control myself enough now to quit.

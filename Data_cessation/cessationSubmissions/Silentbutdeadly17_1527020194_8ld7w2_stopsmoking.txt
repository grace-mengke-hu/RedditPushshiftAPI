Put myself in the worst temptation zone on accident!

I quit cigs and switched to vape 8 days ago. Temptation is everywhere. I work in a bar 6 nights a week. I've done very well. Not one puff. 

Yesterday was my day off... and my boyfriend and i recently got a new(ish) car. So we decided to go for a long drive and enjoy some beautiful country. Oh hey! We're close to the casino! Lets go blow $20 each!

As soon as i walked through the doors i knew i fucked up. My boyfriend couldnt handle it and went and bought a couple cheap cigars... 

I resisted. I was a twitchy mess. I could feel my pupils dialating. I was almost panicked. 

Not. One. Puff. 

Plus i got down to my last spin and we ended up winning a jackpot of $250. 

*high five*

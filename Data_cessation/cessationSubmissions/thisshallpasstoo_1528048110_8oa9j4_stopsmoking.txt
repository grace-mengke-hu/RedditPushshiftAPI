Supporting SO thru quitting via LD relationship

Hey gang, I've used this sub kind of like Al-Anon. I'm trying to better understand what I can do to support her thru this incredibly difficult change in her life. 

After almost a year, she quit smoking yesterday. I'm so  proud of her, and heart broken because I know she's miserable because she's at the peak of 24 hour withdrawals as we speak. 

My ask to you is, what can I do to support her from a far as she tackles this demon? She's on day 8 of Chantix, but otherwise she's cold turkey. Also, can someone describe to me what she's going thru and maybe how she's looking at me as her BF right now. I know when I wrestled my drinking monkey off my back,  I didn't want to hear shit from anyone for a long while. I  needed to do it my way, but I eventually found tremendous support thru humanists AA and SMART. Can someone help me understand her psyche thru this first 72 hours and then maybe the first month.

Thanks for the guidance. 

I'm really proud of each and everyone individual in this thread who is brave enough to stand up and fight this fight with yourself. Over on our side sub r/stopdrinking we like to say IWNDWYT (I will not drink with you today), so in solidarity with everyone here, I will not smoke with you today!

Lastly, there's a small chance you read this S.L.S., and if you do, I'M SO PROUD OF YOU, and it will get better, but YOU'RE DOING IT!!!!!!!!

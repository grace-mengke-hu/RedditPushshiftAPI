One month in.

Vaping has saved me and prevented nasty withdrawals. Started at 12mg nicotine, dropped to 6mg the second week. Currently on 3mg and working on going to 1.5mg. My husband quit about a week after me and bought himself a vape. He's already on 3mg, too. Literally no withdrawal symptoms thus far although the habit itself often crosses my mind (after a meal, during a stressful situation--of which I have had many recently etc.). 

If your willpower sucks, vaping is the way to go. If I can do it, anyone can. Just make sure you have a quality vape. I tried before with the e-cigs (the ones that look like cigarettes) but they just didn't satisfy me.

It's crazy how much I can smell and taste. Cigarettes smell disgusting now. I never thought I'd be one of those people. Lol. Good luck. Keep on trucking!

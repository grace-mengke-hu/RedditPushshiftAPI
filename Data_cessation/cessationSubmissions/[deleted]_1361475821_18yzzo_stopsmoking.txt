Day 4 and something holyshit is happening.

I haven't had a smoke since Sunday morning.  I'm about halfway through the Allen Carr book and it is totally blowing my mind.  (Highly recommended, by the way.)  The first three days, I won't lie, I was pretty antsy.

Today?  I haven't craved a smoke once.  NOT ONCE.  

It's unbelievable.  I was smoking a pack a day, people.  Sometimes more.  I am amazed.  And happy.  And I feel great.

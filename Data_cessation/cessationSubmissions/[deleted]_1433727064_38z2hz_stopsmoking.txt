Quit three addictions. Failed at two. Did not smoke. That'll do. That'll do

I quit three addictions at once. Smoking. Drinking. Porn. Failed at porn first. I thought it just an extra, an after thought. Failed. Rebooted. Taking it seriously now. Failed at alcohol second. I have had long stretches of success quitting booze.  Slipped after 18 months. Slipped after visiting my daughter this weekend. She encouraged me to have a beer when I visit Munich in a couple weeks. I quit to set an example for my  kids. When my daughter encourages me to drink, ah. But I will not fail with smoking. My wife, also an ex-smoker was disappointed I did not buy smokes when I bought booze tonight. I will not fail with quitting smoking. I will not fail with quitting smoking. I will not fail with quitting smoking.

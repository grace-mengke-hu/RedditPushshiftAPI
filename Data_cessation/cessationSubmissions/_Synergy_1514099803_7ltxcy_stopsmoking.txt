I feel like it's now or never.

Hey everyone!!!

So, I've made a few posts but haven't been here in almost 2 weeks because I went down that dirty rabbit hole.

In the last two days of smoking, my heart has been acting really weird and its not the first time. It feels like it hurts and it races so much. I'm 30 and it honestly feels like if I don't do this now, something bad will happen. I've reset my badge and I'm ready to take this on.

All in.

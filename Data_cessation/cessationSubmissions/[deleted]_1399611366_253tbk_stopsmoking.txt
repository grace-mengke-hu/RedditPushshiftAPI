Its Official!!!!

I have just finished a 12 week program with the NHS (sorry USAers) and made me a certified non-smoker. http://i.imgur.com/AF8XkCb.jpg
Truthfully don't even feel like a smoker anymore. Keep going guys, it really does get easier. Temporary pain for long lasting rewards. Keep it up :D

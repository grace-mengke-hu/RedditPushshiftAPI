First day not smoking today.

I made a post a little while ago asking about the use of chantix to quit smoking. I was advised to go cold turkey but against the internet I decided chantix was the best route. I could smoke for the first seven days with no problems today is day number 8. The first day in 9 years that I haven't smoked. It really hasn't been hard seriously the habit is going to be hard to break but other than that I haven't really had any withdrawals. The habit I mean of going outside to take out the trash, after I eat, driving in any car, being on the phone, after i workout (sounds dumb I know) but today I said fuck it I'm done. I feel free today more free than I have in a long long time. Thanks to this subreddit too all your trials and tribulations have made this easier. Thank you!

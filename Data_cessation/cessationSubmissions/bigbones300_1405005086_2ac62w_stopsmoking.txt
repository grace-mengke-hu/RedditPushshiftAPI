question about addiction

hello. i don't smoke very often and i only smoke cigars. like every once in a while. when i smoked in the past, i didn't feel anything really and maybe got a little light headed once in a while. however recently i found that after i smoked a cigar, i would feel extremely calm and relaxed. Now for some reason, whenever I get stressed, i feel like a cigar would relax me... a lot. I don't cave in and I just don't really care, but I know the feeling is there. Is this natural? I've only smoke like 5-6 times in my life... am i feeling  this because my brain is altered due to nicotine? how long does it take to reset to the point where I won't think about a relaxing cigar when I am stressed or nervous? 

thanks very much

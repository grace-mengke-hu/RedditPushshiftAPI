Day 6

It is still up and down for me at this point. I can see myself going to smoke at certain times. I am afraid that I would light up from muscle memory alone and realize after a drag or two that I am smoking. I know that smoking will only make it worse, I am just amazed at some of the subtle ways that smoking dominates my thinking. The one thing I am really looking forward to is when my not smoking is no longer "the major thing in my life" 
I broke my arm once, had a cast, the pain, all of that stuff. It was my life for a while, that broken arm. Everything I did or planned had to center around the fact my arm is broken. That is what it feels like to quit smoking right now. It is the only thing going on in my life and it directs everything. I look forward to the day that I don't think about smoking once.

Do any of you long time ex-smokers keep a pack just in case? Am I dooming my progress by doing so?

I haven't smoked for 20 hours. To be honest I thought it would harder knowing myself, but so far so good. Before I quit by finishing my last pack, however, I bought a new pack and stashed it in the house in case of an emergecy. I was wondering if it's even possible to remain an ex-smoker by having a pack around? did I doom myself to failure before even beginning?

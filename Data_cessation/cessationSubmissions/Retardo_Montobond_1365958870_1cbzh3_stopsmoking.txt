WTF, Chantix?

Here's a snippet of Chantix's disclaimer and precautions:

The most common side effects of CHANTIX include nausea (30%), sleep problems, constipation, gas and/or vomiting. If you have side effects that bother you or don't go away, tell your doctor. You may have trouble sleeping, vivid, unusual or strange dreams while taking CHANTIX. Use caution driving or operating machinery until you know how CHANTIX may affect you.

"vivid, unusual or strange dreams"......LET'S JUST CALL IT WHAT IT IS....NIGHT TERRORS.  3 days after starting Chantix, I woke up completely soaked.  Initially, I thought the waterbed had burst during the night....then I realized that I haven't owned a waterbed in 25 years.  
I was confused and completely freaked out from the dream I had.  I have yet to take another dose....I don't want to elaborate on the dream...but it seriously made me question my own sanity!  That kind of questioning where you brush your teeth, but you don't look at yourself in the mirror...?  
Anyone else having/had similar experiences on Chantix???

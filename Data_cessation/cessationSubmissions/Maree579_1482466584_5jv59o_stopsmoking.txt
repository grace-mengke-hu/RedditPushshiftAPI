Help! In need of some short tasks to take my mind off my cravings

I'm on day 3, using patches. I've tried going cold turkey before and it got me no where. 

Even though I'm on the strongest patch my cravings are driving me nuts, my concentration levels are all over the place. I know I need to 'do something' to distract me but my mind is blank! 

Suggestions folks - fun tasks would very help my mood!

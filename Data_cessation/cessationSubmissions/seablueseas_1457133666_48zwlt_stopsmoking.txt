Lungs are killing me.

Just set my badge again after picking up this dumb habit once more. Only been smoking once or twice a day over the last week and my lungs are killing me. They feel like they are clogged and heavy it's disgusting. Need to quit once and for all. Anyways I don't know why I'm writing this just need to vent somewhere about my damn lung problems.

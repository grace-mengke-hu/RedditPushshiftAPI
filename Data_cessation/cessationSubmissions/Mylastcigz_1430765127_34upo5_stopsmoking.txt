Yeppieeee.... 100 days...

I have started to believe that this is my "n"th try to quit.... all the earlier ones went on well too.. but.. each time they remained to be an n-1 th instance..

This group is awesome and keeps the motivation going... 

coming to my 100th day completion.. it wasn't easy at all.. with 10 cigarettes a day to 0 the next and keep going... ofcourse.. there had been a great health contributor which kept me going.. i m saving to share that incident for my 1 year achievement, which i wanted to get through after 25 years of smoking .... 

you guys rock... and good luck to each one of you out there.. it is difficult .. but its not Impossible.. believe in yourself.. and possibly you would like to come here (to the site) most than to a gas station to get your pack...

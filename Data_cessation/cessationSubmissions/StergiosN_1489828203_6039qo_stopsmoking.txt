Stressful things and setback, but I came back

I learned my wife has to have a surgery. Not something deadly, but a serious. Anyway I had a setback. Started smoking, I considered it as a personal defeat. I came again, after mediated a lot, and thought twice. Smoking was useless, and smoking again made me feel bad throat and cough. I managed to keep me in the non smoking area 4 days so far. Yesterday's cravings were less intense, today better, no coffee, I preferred a herb tea to make my throat better. I hope I all finish my scope that is to save 10 Euros. Not difficult if it goes like this so far. After that a new scope, i want to buy a present to my wif :) The conclusion is smoking is just in our mind after the 4th day.

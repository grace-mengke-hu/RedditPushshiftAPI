Dawn of Day 5

I've made it through the first four days. Last night I dreamed of smoking (and apparently fighting Dr. Venture until Brock Sampson kicked my ass and woke me up). Got up and started going just fine, but I still feel like I need a cigarette to kick the day off. I'm cleaning up right now then heading out the door to work.

Thanks everyone who's given me encouragement this week! It's been tough, but it's Friday. Tonight the real challenge. I'm gonna go party at a friends house. Plan is to get in the pool and not leave it.

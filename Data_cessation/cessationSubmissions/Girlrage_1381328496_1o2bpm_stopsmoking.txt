Well, this sucks.

I'm 28 and the first time I smoked was when I was 15 or 16. I smoked off and on throughout my late teens/early 20s, quit for good for a couple of years, then started smoking again after I married my husband, who's a heavy smoker. However even then I managed to keep it pretty light, generally only smoking maybe once or twice a day. 

Then I got pregnant and quit- it was pretty easy. The only hard time I had was at family gatherings as my husband's whole family smokes (a lot) and it was hard to be the only one not smoking. After I had our baby I breastfed for a couple of months and smoked on rare occasions (when I knew she wouldn't be eating for a while again). 

After I stopped breastfeeding I smoked more and more. Between my husband and myself I think we have been burning through about 2 packs a day (though I probably only smoke about half a pack or so a day and the rest is him). At 8 bucks a pack it's getting spendy. 

We talked a few months ago about quitting. Set a date for August 1. That got pushed out because something stressful (can't remember what) happened. Then we were supposed to quit last week but again...my hubby has been stressed about stuff, so now it's "let's just cut back for now and then quit". I told him there's never going to be a perfect time but I will love him and support him no matter what, even if he never quits. Anyway I have decided to quit by myself... 

I didn't think it would be that hard. I haven't smoked on a regular basis for a very long time and compared to my husband and his family I don't really smoke THAT much I think. But holy shit. I am SO IRRITABLE right now. How long does it take to get past that? Because I feel like I'm going to murder the first person who's unfortunate enough to cross my path, and normally I'm an extremely easy going person. 

TLDR: first day of quitting and I'm majorly pissed off about nothing in particular :(

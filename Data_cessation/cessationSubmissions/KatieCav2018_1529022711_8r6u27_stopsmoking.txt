Soup helps fill the void 🍲

I quit cigs 7 days ago and have been experiencing some pretty strong withdrawal pangs today; the strongest I’ve felt since my quit date. Just wanted to share a tip I’ve found helpful... Try eating a bowl of hot soup. It’s comforting and makes you feel “full” in a different way than other foods might. For me, it’s helped alleviate those feelings of emptiness, anxiety and restlessness, at least temporarily. I’m going to stock my pantry with some low cal soups tomorrow... it’s been the only effective method I’ve found to get through this awful day.

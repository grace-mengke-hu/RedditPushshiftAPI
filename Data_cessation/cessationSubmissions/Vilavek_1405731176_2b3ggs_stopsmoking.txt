Checked in and couldn't believe I made a full year!

I wasn't expecting to have the reaction I did but after trying and failing so much in the past I finally did it. A full year! I got all water eyed and such after seeing that smiley face, which I didn't expect at all.

I want to thank all of you for being a constant means of support and encouragement. This sub is the best!

Need some advice and inspirational/informational video to encourage me stop smoking?

25 m here, I have been smoking a pack each day for the last three years, I really really enjoy smoking just like everyone who smokes I like it.. But not as much as my desire to smoke I like to stop smoking and it's been on my mind for the last month.. What I am afraid of is that after stopping smoking I start again.. i need some educational videos and advice.. I will thank you if you helped me..

4 days, 3 hours, 9 minutes

Just introducing myself. I have quit many times before but then started again. I fell into the trap of thinking that I am a casual smoker and that I could therefore be casual about stopping but that is really not the case. I'm not a smoker anymore and I am determined not to be ever again. Damn hard though

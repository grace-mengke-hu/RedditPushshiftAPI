Smoked just past the 2 month mark

I was smoking an ultra light Marlboro and was in shock thinking why did I just throw away the last two months for a reason I couldn’t even remember? And as soon as I finished the cigarette,my chest hurt but of course I wanted another one and knew I was already immediately addicted again..

I cannot not tell you how relieved I was when I woke up and realized it was just a dream! I haven’t experience any cravings or even thoughts about cigarettes in general in the last 3 weeks so this really hit me out of nowhere. Phew!

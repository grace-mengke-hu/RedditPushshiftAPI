Did I made my life harder?

Hey guys, 

I quit smoking 16 days ago and things were not easy in the beginning, specially the first 6/7 days. After that I was still having some strong cravings every day, but less than before and things looked like we're getting better.

However yesterday I went out party and I was drunk and took 3 puffs (on different times, like one and after one hour one more and one more later) of a friends cigarrette. She was smoking those super slim weak menthol cigarettes.

I know I should know better, and am felling disappointed at myself. However I learned the lesson, since those cigarettes made nothing to me and waking up today without mu throat killings me because i smoked too much like before is a good feeling and makes me feel even more that , not smoking is the way to go.

My question is, did I fucked up my progress? Did my health Benefits from the smoke free app reseted? Should I reset it and put it back on day one? Supposedly after 3 weeks your physical links with smoking die and you have only the habit of it. Did I reset that aswell and will have to wait another 3 weeks all over again? 

Should I reset my counter here as well? 

But more important did I started it all over again because of a few puffs?

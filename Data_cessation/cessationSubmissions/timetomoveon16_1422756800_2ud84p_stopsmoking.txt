I got my Star today!!!!

I never thought I would be where I am today.  All things considered I think the last 31 days have been pretty easy.   I do remember that the first 3 or 4 days were almost unbearable, but looking back it was a long time ago.  I also remember day 8 or 9 being really bad.   Other than that it has been going good and getting easier every day.  
When I was in High School I used to run long distance at track, I remember sprinting that last 100 yards of the race.  I tried to start running again on and off over the years, but with my smoking running a 100 yards is about all I could do.  Well tonight I finally ran a complete mile and a half without stopping and I didn't have any chest pains or problems breathing for the first time in 16 or 17 years.  I canâ€™t describe how good it felt to see the stop sign at the end of the road and find myself running as fast as I could.   It has been a great 31 days.  Thanks to all of you for your support it has helped greatly.
I will join all of you in not smoking today!!

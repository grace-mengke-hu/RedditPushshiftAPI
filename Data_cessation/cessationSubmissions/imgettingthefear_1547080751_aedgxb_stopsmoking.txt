Had nicotine in me every day for 12 years. On day 4 of quitting.

I smoked a pack a day for like 8 years, went to cigars, to vape, to cigars, to cigs, to vape again and finally quit last sat. 

I've been ok but I recently tapered down my anxiety meds and quit before xmas. Today I was in a mood all freaking day. I think I have anger issues. I was off work and couldn't get motivated until noon. I would have rather been at work. I hate everything. Everyone is stupid. I don't even want to get on Facebook because it really bothers me. Some friends and family always come over uninvited drives me insane. My husband got a nice punching bag for xmas it's come in handy but I think I over did it and sprained my wrist. 

I can't vent to anyone, I don't feel like doing anything I enjoy except eating. It's 630 and I'm just gonna try to go to sleep and hope I don't wake up like this tomorrow. Is this super abnormal? How long till I'm not an asshole anymore? Maybe this is the new miserable me.

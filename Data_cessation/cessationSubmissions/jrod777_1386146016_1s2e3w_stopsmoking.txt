Just finished Allen Carrs book and I have had my last cigarette

Like the title says, I just smoked my last cigarette, I've tried to quit in the past but this time seems different. I know I'm going to better myself in all aspects of my life. I've suffered from depression my entire life and smoking just made it worse. I vow to never smoke again. Here's to a smoke free life!

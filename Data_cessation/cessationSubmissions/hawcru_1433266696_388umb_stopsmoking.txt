May 29 would have been one year...

Yes, would have. And come to think about it, when I picked up that first smoke again. It was just a drag. I had a few beers. They smelled good. Just one puff. Couldn't hurt. 

It turned into bumming one in car rides. 

Then a pack. 

Then you stopped running, biking, lifting. 

Drank more. 

Felt flabby. 

Because you had that puff two months ago. 

Every day is a struggle. It's not easy. I had 290+ days off. But that one day on changed it all. But watching myself go back to smoking on a regular basis showed me a few things. 

1. The struggle is real. Every day, smoking or not. We can continue to celebrate the milestones but we should always fear the zero. 
2. Keep the goals in check. 
3. Stay strong even in the weakest of moments. 
4. Quitting is hard, not impossible. 

Just because I had two months of fucking up doesn't mean I didn't have support from the awesome people of this sub. It just means this time I know more, I've learned from the mistakes and its time to keep on keeping on.

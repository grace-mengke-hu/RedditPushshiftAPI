My umpteenth attempt. I'm quitting now. Tomorrow is the problem.

Everyday I want to quit. I stated after being quit for few weeks. Been a smoker for 13 years or over. 

I plan to stop and get into exercise.. so while at it I lose weight. Hopefully :) 

Wish me a calm mind and loads of fresh air. 
This sub rocks!!

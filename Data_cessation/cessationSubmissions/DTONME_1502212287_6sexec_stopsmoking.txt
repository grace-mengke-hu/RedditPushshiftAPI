Smoked a Cigarette Today 7 Days After Quitting

In my opinion smoking one cigarette doesn't mean I have to start all over again. I feel like I've still been a non-smoker for 7 days and i didn't completely destroy all the progress I made. Other people say because I smoked a cigarette I'm back to do day 1 of not smoking. What do you guys think?

3 days in

On Tuesday while I was getting ready for work I felt that my lungs were not working.  I couldn't take deep breaths and had to sit down for about 15 minutes.  I was not sure if I could drive so I was late to work.
This was an eye opening experience for me and also the moment that i realized that I had to stop smoking.  It has now been three days and I am chewing the devils gum like a motherfucker but I haven't had a smoke yet and that makes me happy.  
I have been smoking since 1993 and the longest I have gone with out is maybe three weeks.  It's time to make the change and it terrifying but exhilarating at the same time.
Wish me luck guys.

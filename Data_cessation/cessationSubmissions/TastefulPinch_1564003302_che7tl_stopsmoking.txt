Need help!!! Can’t keep without a smoke for longer than 2 days.

Hey, I’m in a bit of a issue. I’ve been trying to quit smoking for about a couple of weeks now. Let’s says I’ve tried three times so far. 
Personally my tactic has been to stop smoking the day when I’m hungover cause I cannot stand smoking after a night out. That’s all fine but it gets to the second day and I’m already feeling the cravings. The cravings aren’t so bad if I’m doing ok personally, but it seems that the cravings seem to make me so bloody irritable. I’m normally a pretty chill out person but Id end up being really mean and snappy with my boyfriend, my mum and my friends. It has led to some arguments about generally stupid stuff( nothing extreme but generally awful). 

As soon as I have a cigarette I’m fine after and I can think clearly and stop being an asshole. I feel really bad cause I wanna quit for various reasons but I fear that if I try more it’ll just affect my personal relationships, I’ve snapped at my mum for no reason and basically I don’t want to do that, it’s not me. I know it sounds like I’m being an asshole but I just don’t know what to do, 

Any tips with helping irritability? I’ve tried everything: vaping ( can’t get used to the method of smoking) chewing Nicolette gums ( they irritate my tongue) and just nothing works. 

P.s. boyfriend doesn’t smoke so I tend to not smoke around him but my parents smoke a lot and I live with them and it’s so hard to avoid it especially if we’re sitting in the garden having a drink etc etc 

Any sort of help would be greatly appreciated! Thank you

Cold turkey, just the way we like it.

I've been smoking for 8 years now, and always struggled with the habit, more than the addiction. But because of medical reasons I've decided to just quit, cold turkey. Just like any addiction I kicked so far. It's been only 4 and a half hours and I'd already kill for a cigarette. Any advice on how to manage the cravings besides sucking on a pencil?

I'm finally here

I've been following this sub for weeks. Tonight I think I finally have something to share. For 8 weeks I've been using patches. Patches for me have been awesome. I haven't smoked even a drag in 4 weeks. It's been hard and I have missed smoking so much at times, but giving up feels so great! I've been on a 7 mg patch for two weeks. Tonight I just know I'm done with this. I am not a smoker :)

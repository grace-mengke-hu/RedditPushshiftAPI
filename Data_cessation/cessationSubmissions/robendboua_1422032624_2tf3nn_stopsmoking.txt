How to quit being a smoker (not how to quit smoking)?

I'm 28, been smoking 12 years. I've tried to quit many many times before, but never got past 12 hours (literally). Always came up with some excuse that I would do it the next day, next year, whatever.

Wednesday, on my way to work, I felt good, strong, somewhat pumped. Life has been good lately. I was jogging cause I was just on time and didn't want to be late, and the desire to quit that's been building up lately peaked. As I was jogging by a trashcan by the entrance I threw out my pack of tobacco without interrupting my jog. I felt ready to fight my addiction.

The things is, 3 days in now, the fight hasn't come yet, at least not how I expected it. I could never last 3 days before, but this time I haven't even had a craving. I am having a different battle though.

I don't feel like I'm trying to resist a nicotine craving or to feed some urge, I feel like I am having an internal discussion with myself about whether I want to be a non smoker. After all, I've been a smoker all my adult life, and it's a lot more than just something I do, it's part of who I am. It's part of how I see myself, how others see me, it's something I do socially.

Fuck I'm just not sure anymore. I want to quit, I know that, but only because I have started to see how it harms me and don't want to let it continue to. However, I do feel like I am sacrificing an important part of me. 

Will I always feel this way? How can I make it better? Your thoughts please?

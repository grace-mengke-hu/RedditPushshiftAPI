Will dropping the intake amount reduce the withdrawal symptoms?

I'm not a smoker myself, but I got addicted to nicotine through snus usage. I tried to quit some time ago for fun, but apparently, even though I did not crave for it, I developed some symptoms such as insomnia and bloated belly. Insomnia was the worst, so after few days without nicotine, I started using again as I simply couldn't afford myself to not sleep. I reduced the intake by 50% of my average, but honestly, I just want to fully drop it since I realized I am physically addicted. My question is, will dropping the intake reduce the symptoms when I finally stop? If so, for how long would I have to adjust my body to a lower amount of nicotine?

Thanks

Didn't even realize I have more than 50 days clean! & A short success story.

First and foremost, I'd like to publically thank /u/erinmichele819 for buying & shipping me "Allen Carr's Easy Way to Stop Smoking (ISBN 13:  978-0615482156) for their selflessness and care to a complete stranger. If it wasn't for them, I might still an active smoker.

I was counting days when I just started quitting the habit. Now, I have 52 days clean, the most I've ever had. The hardest part about quitting, I've noticed? Making the decision. "Anything I’ve ever done that ultimately was worthwhile… initially scared me to death." -- Betty Bender.

Success story: Last night was the first Friday of the first week of undergrad classes (I'm a senior graduating in December), so it's typical for people to party, drink, smoke, etc etc etc. A good friend of mine, who's a fellow researcher, classmate, and colleague, had a few others and me over for a small housewarming party. Really there were only fifteen people in total, our age. So we're sitting on her balcony, having some beer, smoking some weed (I personally don't), and **someone pulls out my once favorite "novelty cigarette"** Djarum Black Cloves. She was offering to share them to others, and I almost accepted. I remembered how well I thought it tasted, felt, the whole deal; mind you, I'm rather tipsy at this point. 

So I'm sitting there, watching her light it, and in a total state of indecision... until I smelled the smoke. It reminded me of one of the reasons why I removed smoking from my life -- she's in active addiction. She "had" to have that cigarette. So I kept drinkin' a beer, havin' a few laughs, and the thought of accepting her offer left my head. 

I'm so very proud of myself, so thankful to you all (and one person in particular!), and hold no doubt that all of you here will continue to pursue removing this from your lives. :)

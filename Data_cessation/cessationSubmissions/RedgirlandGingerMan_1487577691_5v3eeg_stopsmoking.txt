2 years yesterday

Can't believe it's been two years! I used to be such a heavy smoker! I'd lie and say that I only smoked about 10 roll ups per day but in reality it was so many more than that! Never thought I'd get here but here I am and I'm so proud of myself. 

I now have the lung capacity that I can sing while I walk the dogs (nobody around obviously) and I can jog, cycle, swim! I don't wheeze when I'm asleep, clothes don't stink, I don't have yellow stains on my fingers, I don't time my day around cigarettes! 

If I can do it, there's hope for the rest of you!

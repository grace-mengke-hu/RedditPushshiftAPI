Day 5, is this it?

Today is day 5 nicotine free. The first 3 days were absolutely horrendous and I almost cracked many times, however, I made it through. Now I am beginning to feel much more confident that I won't be smoking any time soon, but I still worry that maybe it might get worse. It just seems easy to me, too easy (read that in a dramatic tone). I hope the worst part is over, and if it is, there is no chance I will ever smoke again!

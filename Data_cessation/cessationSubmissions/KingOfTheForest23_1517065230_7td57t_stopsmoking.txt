10 Days withdrawals

Hey all, first time posting. Actually created an account so I could become part of the community after reading for the last 10 days. It hasn’t been an easy road and now the biggest physical symptoms are tingles that come and go, night sweats, and brain fog. Just had blood work done and all of my numbers look good, so I’m guessing this is all part of it! 

Anyone with the tingles and night sweats, when did it start to ease up??

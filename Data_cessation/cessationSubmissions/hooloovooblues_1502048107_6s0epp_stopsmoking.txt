Good snack recommendations?

Tomorrow will mark one week smoke-free for me and MOTHER OF GOD I AM SO HUNGRY ALL OF THE TIME. I don't want to replace smoking with eating, but walking through the candy aisle with my friend yesterday was abject torture.  

Any suggestions for healthy and tasty things to munch on? I'd like to use the decision to quit smoking as a kick-off to be healthier in general: eat better and exercise more.  

Edit: First thing, as I decided it was more motivating, I decided to walk/run the two miles to our local Wal-Mart with my backpack on than take my car and I feel amazing! I ended up purchasing almonds, walnuts, dried cranberries, sun-dried tomatoes, single serving packets of high-moisture mozzarella cheese, snap peas, baby carrots, blueberries, some weirdly small Concord grapes, apple chips, baby spinach (which is what I use for salads), and a peach flavored drinkable yogurt that I'm sure isn't good for me at all but sounded really tasty.  

It might not be perfect, but it's better than the Reese's cups/hi-chews/gummi bears/other candy around the house I've been inhaling.

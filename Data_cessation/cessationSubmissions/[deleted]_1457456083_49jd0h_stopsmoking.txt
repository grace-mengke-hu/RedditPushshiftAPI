Mooooooody!

Made it to 10 days and counting! Really stoked about the physical achievement but struggling with the mental adjustment. I just don't feel like me at the moment, I feel disconnected from my husband, and life in general, and I'm still getting crazy mood swings which are starting to give me (and my husband) whiplash! Just can't seem to get a grip on myself. Anyone else out there feel this way? Or remember feeling this way when you were still in that first 2 weeks of a quit? Please tell me it gets better soon...ðŸ˜–

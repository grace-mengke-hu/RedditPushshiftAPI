I can't believe how different life is, now.

I quit on Dec 27th, 2014. I really had to think about the year, because I don't really think about it, often. 

Anyway, I'm doing the Color Dash today. I can run and enjoy it, without hurting or suffering from a coughing fit. If I were smoking still, I know for a fact, I would not be doing this charity run. My exact thought would be "Eh, I don't want to cough or deal with sore lungs."

Seriously? I can't believe that's what my excuses were like. The addiction not only held me back, but had an effect on my confidence. It owned me. 

Yeah, quitting is hard, but once you get to that point where you realize you can take control of your own life, then it will all be worth it. 

Also, I can speak to people, and not worry about my breath. Oh, and something else I just thought of... Many comments on how white my teeth are.  

Guys/gals, remind yourself of all the things that you're able to do, without the nicotine control. Tons of things that you just won't have to worry about. 

I keep trying to hit submit, but I keep thinking of things I'm able to do.

Like hold my best friend's baby, and not smell like cigs, and not worrying about brushing my teeth before I kiss my husband. 

I talk about it a lot, especially to my best friends, who were non-smokers. They were with me a lot when I smoked, and they witnessed and experienced the inconvenience. Talking helps. Tell your parents. Tell your cat. Tell your friends. Tell a stranger! Tell me!!

Question

When to get a vape for the extremely difficult days that I feel like I just need something. I told the shop owner upon entering that I wanted a pen type thing with no nicotine because I quit smoking ten days ago, Iâ€™m testing out the testers they have and I feel a kick in the back of my throat upon the second tester and ask him if there is any nicotine in the tester and he informs me there is 3 milligrams in the testers.

Question am I going to have to go through the whole withdrawal process again?
How long/short will it be?
I ended up getting the vape with liquid that has no nicotine in it (the bottle says it as well and it was opened and stayed in front of me.)

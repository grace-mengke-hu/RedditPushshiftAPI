2 months free.. 1 week pointless relapse.

I was a chain cigarette smoker for 15 years
 I had no shame about it. My lung collapsed once and I didn't care. But something snapped im me recently and I quit- I hadn't had nicotine of any kind in two months! I survived and I was SO proud of myself. But last weekend, I decided it would be a good idea to buy a cheap vape to take to the bar with me. Five days later and I'm still puffing on it. I tossed it across the room earlier and I texted my friends that I threw it away. Lol
 But it's actually sitting across the room on the floor. Taunting me.
Now I get to go through withdrawals all over again... for what? By the way, it felt AMAZING that night to do it. Pure pleasure and relief. Then every day since it has just been a task. Because that's how sick this drug is. It is not enjoyable. The only purpose it serves is to satisfy its own craving. The only relaxation you gain from it is... well, getting to avoid the utter panic you feel if you ignore the craving. It is only rewarding to use it because it punishes you otherwise
 And it is disgusting how quickly it attaches itself to each and every menial fucking task and detail of life, one by one. Eat drink sleep wake up drive bad day good day morning bed time coffee conversation boredom... the completion of any task... all will require a cigarette or vape.
I hate you, nicotine.

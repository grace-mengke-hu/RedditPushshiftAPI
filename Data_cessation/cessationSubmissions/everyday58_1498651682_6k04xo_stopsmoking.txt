Is it easier to quit smoking while still getting high?

I'm struggling with both cigarettes and pot. I quit smoking cigarettes for a few days at a time while straight. Now I'm smoking both. 

When I failed at cigs, I couldn't even look at this sub straight. At least now when I'm high, I can read this. 

I've tried all types of ways to quit. The best one was getting pregnant and quitting for 14 years. Due to age that is no longer a possibility. Lol. 

Anyone have some experience with this?

How to quit smoking like a fucking Boss.

If you have successfully quit smoking, congrats to you and I will say that whatever way you did it is as admirable as the Boss way. Read no further and enjoy your newfound health. Forgive all the grammatical errors and the style that I write this.

I will no longer exclude the possibilities of there being other less Boss ways of quitting. I'll save time right here in this sentence so you can decide if you wanna read any further; just stop putting the fucking things in your mouth. Easy enough right? Yeah "Fuck you" youre saying, thats just too god damn hard, right? Well in the tl;dr version thats all you need to read to quit like a Boss. Maybe you need an idea of how to be a fucking Boss. Keep reading, I will tell you.


**Did you know:**

 if youre as seriously fucked up as I was off those things youre probably spending around 5 bucks a day or 150 bucks a month on them? Congrats, thats enough money to buy your ass a gym membership, buy some supplements, food *and* put gas in your car.

**The night before quitting:**

Pick a night to go out (your Friday before 2 days off), get drunk smoke as much as you want.....fuck it. Shove as many of those fucking things down your lungs as you can comfortably stand; smoke so much that youre actually bumming smokes from other people. Have fun, make an ass out of yourself, get hammered as you can but set your alarm for 4 am and dont buy any smokes that night. Wtf right? I will explain.

**Day 1 4am**

Wake your ass up motherfucker!
 
What?! 

Youre going for a walk! 

A walk wtf? 

A walk. Get up, get dressed, get ta steppin' bitch.

 How long of a walk? 

Until you cant walk anymore, pussy. 

**Day 1 4:15am: Walking**

"Where the fuck am I going?"...."Maybe I will just walk around the block, that seems reasonable" .... "Lets do this shit!" ....."I am not putting another fucking cigarette in my mouth, no matter what happens." ...."I dont care if I lose my living space, my SO, any of that shit, my depression wont have to mean my failure at quitting" ... " I am tired of being a fucking slave to drug." .... "I am tired of always having to worry about how many cigarettes I have left or where I can buy them late at night"..... "What the fuck is that worry even doing for me? I am slowly paying to kill myself at 5 bucks a day while my family sits and watches it." .... "They are too polite to stop me, too worried I would be hurt but they know I am killing myself and paying out the ass to do it.".... "Only I can stop myself,  I have to make this fucking decision and I cant wait to see what they do when i tell them I quit"

**Mid-walk (Wherever you are and however long it took to get there. Hint: It wont just be around the block!)**

"Damn, my fucking lungs hurt and so do my calves"

"I have never walked this far; I dont know if I can make it back" 

**Take a rest on some grass or a bench or something.**

This is where you think about how worthless of a habit smoking is. How much has it cost you? How much will it cost you if you continue not just from the actual cost of smokes but the cost of the healthcare needed to support the habit? Think about yourself smoking the rest of your life, isnt it fucking terrifying? Why the fuck are you doing it? All smoking another cigarette will do is make you want to smoke another one in the future. Over and over and over again, until you die younger than you want. Why? To relax? You're no more relaxed than a non smoker when you smoke, in fact you are desperately always trying to achieve the same relaxation as a non smoker. Your former self would freak the fuck out when it went a few hours without smoking. Not your new self, your new self wins these 20 second craving battles. Your new self knows it can hang on those 20 seconds and prevail winning battle to battle until it has won the war.  How do you know that? Have you smoked? With your lungs on fire, your heart racing, and your legs hurting as you lay in the morning sun.....do you even really feel the need to smoke right now? Fuuuuuck no. You should be hurting at this point and quite concerned about how youre going to get home. Just rest, breathe, drink some water, water is your new friend. Cherish it. How could it be so flavorlessly delicious? Well.... you forgot your cellphone, payphones are a bit sparse in the cellular age and youre too sweaty, red-faced and awkward to knock on someones door. Only way home is the same way you came.

**Walking home:**  

This should be an indication of how out of shape you are. Youre regretting this decision. You are now on a death march prodded by the will to get home and crash because youre hungover, exhausted, weary, mad at yourself for letting your physical condition get so bad yet proud how far you have come despite. You *will* make it home. Dont worry. You will be ok ya big pussy.

**Get Home in one piece:**

You fucking made it, congrats. Hit the shower immediately. Take a looooong hot one and focus on how badass youre gonna be when people smoke around you. Its not going to even matter... youre not even going to say shit to them either. Just not gonna smoke. Youre not gonna move away from them when they do either. Youre gonna take it like a champ and be resilient and resolute. Its their shitty decision to keep smoking, they gotta figure it out themselves....but they are gonna trip balls when you arent smoking with them. They are going to support you and not smoke around you because they think they are helping. Tell them "Fuck no, come'ere fucker and smoke that shit right here by me. I dont give a fuck. I have to learn how to deal with people smoking around me. Youre actually helping me, thanks!"

**Out of the shower and dressed**

Eat something! Make it healthy though, vegetables, fruit, light protein, simple carbs.... stuff thats gonna make you feel good about eating it. Get the biggest container you can feasibly think of and fill it full of ice water. Take that shit with you to bed for a nap. 

**When you wake**

Tell everyone why they heard you up that morning. Youre quitting smoking. Enjoy all encouragement. Find something to do. Clean out your car. Get rid of all your empty smoke packs, lighters, grab a vacuum and clean that shit until you can smell cigarettes any more. Feel a craving? Call someone and tell them you quit. Get some more encouragement. Keep your hands busy. Keep drinking water and pissing out all of that shitty nicotine. Youre fucking doing it plus youre doing all the chores you have put off. Youre talking to people who you havent in awhile and you have something exciting to tell them. Kick ass! 

**Talk some shit to people.**

"Yeah, I dont know what I was thinking every time I smoked anyway"

"I am gonna show you guys how to quit watch!"

"This isnt easy but I like that kind of shit" 

"Im sorry you guys had to watch me kill myself in front of you so long"

"I cant even get excited about this shit, its really fucking easy to quit smoking"

 Now youre locked in. You will look like a TOTAL ASS if you go back to smoking. Thats just another tool. You have to throw everything you fucking have into this shit. You cant fight fair. This is your motherfucking time, right motherfucking now and you will win. You have the motivation. If you were drowning in an ocean, would you not fight with all you had to get that next breath of air? See? You have motivation and thats what you will need. You ARE fighting to breathe. 

**Go to bed champ, tomorrow is a different battle**

Wake early. Get your ass on google and find a workout routine. Jim Stoppani has some good ones, for example. Bodybuilding.com is your new free friend. Print that shit out. Drink some coffee, survive coffee without smoking. Healthy breakfast. Get in your clean car,  grab your mp3 player, go to the gym, survive driving without smoking.....sign up. Bust your ass, that day, as soon as the paperwork is finished. After you workout, go home, shower, eat, rest, drink water, keep yourself productive and busy. Get more shit done with the shear motivation of wanting to distract yourself from smokes. Youre getting good at that afterall, youre surviving. 

**Keep this up**

Wake your ass up, workout, prepare healthy snacks for breaks at work. Get some fucking gum. Gum is amazingly helpful. So are baby carrots. You'll need all of that shit. Dont let work stress you out but if it does, youre not gonna be a big pussy and smoke right? Fuck no, youre gonna eat baby carrots, celery, whatever the fuck.... as long as its healthy. Keep talking that shit to your coworkers, friends and family, hang the fuck in there. You'll make it. Be ready to be around people who still smoke, dont give them shit unless they ask for it by saying they wanna quit too. Jump into a smoking area just to test your might. Win that shit. RAWWWRR!!! You fucking Boss you. You dont need them shits anymore. Its just one day at a time, you learn how to self-soothe, you learn your alternatives but best of all you learn your own inner strength and you keep going. You remind yourself "20 seconds....just 20 seconds and this wont matter anymore". Getting shit done, getting stronger, getting faster, getting smarter. This is you now... Every. Mother. Fucking. Day. From here on out.....

....BOSS!

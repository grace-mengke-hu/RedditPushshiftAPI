Probably won't last long, but I'm going to try to start quitting tomorrow

Tonight I'm finishing my last pack, and hopefully tomorrow will be my first of many smoke-free days. I'm avoiding taking an overly confident approach to this for two reasons: 1) my chances of success, as with all smokers, are in fact very small, and 2) my longest quit, which lasted for over a year, started out as an experiment to see how long I could go without smoking. I guess the whole thing about making a huge public commitment to never, ever smoke again is just overwhelming to me. Maybe I thrive on low expectations, or something.

I'm quitting right now largely because I'm in a certain fortuitous set of circumstances that leaves me absolutely no excuse not to: I have the summer off of school and teaching (grad student), the job I'm working to make ends meet is the epitome of low-stress jobs, and my girlfriend is thousands of miles away for the next month -little opportunity to snap out on her, fight and stress-smoke. I am extremely blessed to have this time to improve myself, and I will probably never have such a perfect opportunity again.

So you're probably going to be seeing a lot of me as I go through the living hell that the next few weeks are going to bring. I'll try not to snap out on any of you guys.

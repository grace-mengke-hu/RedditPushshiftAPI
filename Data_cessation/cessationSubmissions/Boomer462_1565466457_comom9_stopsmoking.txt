Tricky Trigger

Alrighty then...here's a story for you and also a trick that may help. Today after 10 months and nine days smoke-free, the "I am at home alone and no one will ever know" trigger visited me. Now no worries he was gone in about 15 seconds but it was strong for that short time. I did what this community taught me and went over all the reasons that I quit in the first place and then tried to imagine how awful one cigarette would taste and all that I would be throwing away. Then, for the cherry on the top, I thought about cleaning out my old (threw it away 10 months ago) "smokers friend" butt receptacle.If you have ever done it...that right there is enough to get you to quit. Happy weekend! NTAP!!!

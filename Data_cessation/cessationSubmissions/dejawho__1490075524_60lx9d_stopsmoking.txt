Feeling the change yet? I do.

Hey former smokers and current relapsers!
Before you think I'm judging you I'm the biggest relapser! I relapse a few times a day, but thank god I don't like smoke as a habit! But seriously, how do you deal with relapses? I'm serious in quitting and I don't feel like I get back to old habit of smoking everyday. However, I want to get rid of those occasional smokes here and there (mostly with people that I care about). So help me and I help you in my prayers :P God Bless.

The Story of Us

Thank you, Reddit. 

You just did something that, for over 20 years, no one else was ever able to do: you helped me get serious about ending this disease. And I mean it when I say *no one else*--not me, not my beautiful, loving wife, not my amazing, adorable 3-year-old, not my brothers, not my parents, not my friends, doctor/dentist, coworkers... no one.

I started smoking at the age of 19. I barely remember why I started, except that I was away at college. There may have been a girl involved. (Not what you think--quite the contrary--really and actually quite pathetic--typical unrequited nerd-love.)

Coming home on breaks, I soon learned how to become the worst kind of smoker, the "secret smoker".  (Yes, what seems to be working for me is Allen Carr's^1 book.) Every time I was home, I'd come up with a new way to hide it or cover it up, a new way of thinking about smoking, a new pat answer/excuse. I developed a whole arsenal of illusions and lies that carried me through the next 16 years, the next 3,328 packs of cigarettes...

I am so ashamed, and now so angry, at all the ways this disease (with my permission, with my complicity and with my cooperation) intruded on ~~some~~ all of the most important, most intimate moments of my life.

I remember ducking out minutes before my wedding for a puff, and then washing my hands and rinsing my mouth frantically in the bathroom. Scrubbing, scrubbing... Out! Out! Damned spot! I was almost late.

I remember sitting with my dad in his last moments at the hospital, desperately wishing to step out for a drag. I did manage to sneak away. Luckily, he didn't die while I was outside choking myself.

I once left my toddler in the back seat of the car to "check something in the trunk". For 10 minutes. Without opening up the trunk. What can I say? I'm a car trunk ninja.

Throughout, I never thought of myself as anything but a good person. But the truth is, I was a fraud--the disease made me a fraud--and I let it keep happening.

Good times, bad times, all the time, my "good" "pal" (neither "good" nor a "pal") was there in the shadows to foul and dirty up the experience.

But I don't need to tell you. You know your story. Except for the details, it's basically the same as mine.

If you've already kicked it, I'm jealous that you got here before me. (And I'm glad and super grateful that you were here to help me and others like me.) If you haven't, I hope you figure it out soon.

^1 I'll try to avoid sounding like an Allen Carr fanboy. Just a note to the skeptics/suspicious: if you're serious about quitting, his message is worth *understanding*. (I read somewhere that the program has a 50% success rate. For the math wizards, that's 50% higher than my own super-duper, super-secret, new fangled, usb-powered quitting method.) My takeaway and explanation for the success rate is this: quitting smoking doesn't happen when you're "ready to quit smoking"--because you will never be "ready to quit smoking". (Seriously, those words strung together do not refer to, relate to or bear any resemblance to reality.) It happens when you're ***ready to quit making excuses for yourself***, when you're ***ready to quit lying to yourself***. That said, relax. Remain calm. You may not be ready to quit the illusions/delusions/lies. It's ok. Lies can be useful and serve important purposes. But make no mistake about it, they are lies. And you will be called to account for them after they've outlived their usefulness. The trick is to realize when the lies no longer make sense and to do something about it as soon as you realize it.

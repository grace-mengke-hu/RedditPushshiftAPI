Has anyone quit while their SO continued smoking? Any advice?

So I got my wisdom teeth out on the 7th and was pretty much forced to quit for the second time. 
I quit last summer for 3 months before working at a bar (surrounded by smokers) got the best of me and I said, " just one!" Which was a HUGE mistake obviously. I was prepared to quit then though, I had an e-cig, and it was actually very easy to lower the mg until I was only vaping 0 mg of nicotine and not freakin out if I was out of cartridges or my cig wasn't charged. My only mistake was believing that I could have just one and not pick up the habit again. 
This time I knew I wouldn't be allowed to smoke or even use my e cig but I don't know if I was entirely prepared. 
By the end of the day on the 7th, I begged my boyfriend to pick me up the patch. 
He decided he would quit with me (he quit for 3 months with an e cig too until it broke, though he smoked probably 2 packs in that time), but now feels he isn't ready. I respect that, but him smelling like smoke, seeing his pack right there on the table, it's killing me. Making the cravings pretty much unbearable. On top of it, the patches aren't stopping my irritability at all and I'm being a huge bitch even though I'm really trying not to be. I don't think it's helping that I've been eating nothing but soft food for almost a week. 
Should I just quit quitting and wait until I'm totally ready again? Do it with an e-cig again? Try to stick this out even if I don't feel prepared?
Any suggestions or advice is super appreciated. I'm very grateful this sub and all you lovely people exist as you did help me my first time to make it as far as I did.

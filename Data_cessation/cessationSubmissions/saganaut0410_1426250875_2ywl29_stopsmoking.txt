Week Three Reflections

Today is 21 days without a cigarette; this is without a doubt the longest I have gone since I was about 14.

I'm still coughing up a whole bunch of tar and such, but it has lessened. I commuted by bike two days this week instead of bus (enough snow finally melted) and found that I am not out of breath as easily (I bike about 3 miles, about half is up hill).

I keep eating a lot of junk, despite having been a smoker I have always been very health conscious about food. Fortunately I do not seem to have gained any weight, I suspect yoga (1-2 classes per week, practice on own about 5 days per week since quitting) is to thank.

I still get very strong cravings, but they are in response to intense emotion or well established smoking triggers (I had to cut down on coffee). Although I don't like doing it because it reinforces the act of smoking as something good, I will roll an herbal cigarette to deal with an intense craving (peppermint, lavender and rose petal for the most part). How did other people feel starting their third week?

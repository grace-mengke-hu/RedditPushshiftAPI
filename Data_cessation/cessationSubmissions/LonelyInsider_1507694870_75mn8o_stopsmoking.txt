Convince me to quit smoking.

I know smoking is bad and I should quit smoking, but I feel like I have no real reason to completely quit smoking. 

I started smoking when I was 13 years old, and have smoked on and off since, I am 20 now. I am a college swimmer, and I mostly quit, cut down to maybe 1-2 a day when I am in season, but during my off weeks, I smoke maybe half a pack a day. I don't even know if I have an addiction. Sure my hands shake a little and I think about cigarettes none stop the first couple of days back in season, but I am so physically exhausted I don't even find quitting the hard part of the start of a new season. I don't even know if I have an addiction. I know smoking is bad and that I should quit, as I hide it from my coaches and teammates. But at the same time, I am as healthy a person I can be I guess. I have no family history of cancer, heart disease, and I am very physically fit. I know I should stop, but I just can't convince myself to. I feel like smoking and all the other stuff I get up to is my little secret, things I can do to get away from the constant training and competition. 

Guys I need help. Can someone convince me to quit smoking? Give me good reasons to quit smoking. I know I am young and healthy and it won't stay this way forever. But I always feel like I can quit whenever I wanted because I've done it so many time, though never permanent. I want to stop, but I don't want to stop. What do I do? 

Thanks!

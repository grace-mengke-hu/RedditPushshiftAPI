BF is trying to quit today. It’s been about...20 minutes. He’s almost crying. Help plz.

So, we don’t have money for cigarettes right now. And I was like weeeelll...you do want to quit right? It’s never gonna be easy, best time to quit smoking is now!   
He agrees, but he’s upset. He kept saying “I don’t know if I should do it. I like smoking. It helps”. I told him what it “helps” is the nicotine withdrawals, not regular every day stress. In fact, he’d probably be better at handling stress if he wasn’t a smoker!    
I’m only comfortable saying these things because I am an ex smoker too and I KNOW it sucks balls to quit. But other than telling him about how shitty addiction is and why smoking sucks I don’t know what to say. I feel like a bad partner. 
    
Idk I just don’t really know how to comfort him. I’m looking at him across the room right now and he’s so miserable. He’s breathing really hard. Part of me wants to just borrow some money and go get him cigarettes. But that’s so wrong.      
What should I do :( I know it’s gonna suck but I want it to suck the least. He’s been a smoker since he was like 13 (he’s 22 now).

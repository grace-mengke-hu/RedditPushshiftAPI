I just got tonsillitis

Weeks before (actually since a few years ago), I planned to quit but only wanted to quit more recently. I was planning to quit after my final exams, where there's no reason for me to smoke. I told some of my friends about wanting to quit, and suddenly i got tonsillitis.  It's really painful (physically), and now I feel like this is the perfect opportunity to quit. So starting today, I'm quitting (my first attempt to quit in so long).

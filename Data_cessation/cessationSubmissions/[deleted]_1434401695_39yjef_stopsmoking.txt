Trying to to moan or be negative...

...but guys and gals, yesterday and today have been difficult. Persistent, long-lasting cravings that are really f*cking with my head/body. 

I believe I'm handling them fairly well (disputing irrational thoughts, reminding myself to be grateful that I'm not smoking, that cigarettes only "cure" a problem that they themselves create, etc...)...but sweet Jesus, the cravings are strong today. 

Just wanted to share. Anyone else out there who is struggling with big, razor-sharp cravings...I feel you. Stay strong.

EDIT: Wait, so you can't edit titles? So I have to look at my stupid typo for the rest of the day?!?

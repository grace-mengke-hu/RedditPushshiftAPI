Third time quitting, 16 days.

First time was for about 18 months, next one for 3 years. Third time here I come, this time I'm using a vape with nicotine to stop smoking and to be honest, it has never been this easy to quit. 

I'm not aware of the dangers that vaping with nicotine might have, but it's a short term to switch to zero nicotine after this tube is done (which should be around next week). 

What are your thoughts about this?

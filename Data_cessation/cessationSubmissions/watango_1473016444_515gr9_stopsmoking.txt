Day five and a terrible craving

I made it through, fortunately, I just buckled down and refused to buy a pack.

I woke up this morning wanting a cigarette in a way that I don't remember experiencing before.  I lay in bed scowling at my ceiling while I rationalized why it would be ok for me to sun to the store and buy a pack.  When it passed I was grateful that i didn't succumb but damn I don't like getting a nic fit like that.

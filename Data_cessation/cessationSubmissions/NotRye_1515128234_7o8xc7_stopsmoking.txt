My second quit with Allan Car

I originally quit for 2 years after listening to AC's audiobook.  It worked as advertised but I made the mistake of having "just one cigarette" during college practicum.  It's been 7 months and I'm finally quitting again... Well I was on nicotine gum for a while but it didnt work.  

Anyway, this morning I watched the hour long AC video, smoked my last cigarette and have been cold turkey for about 12 hours now.  While taking in the info for a second time didn't have the same impact as the first, I still find it better than not using AC's method at all.   

I guess that's allI wanted to say.  Best of luck to the rest of you and thanks for reading my post.

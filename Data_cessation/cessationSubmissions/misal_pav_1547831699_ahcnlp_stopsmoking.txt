It's okay not not smoke

It's okay to have friends who also don't smoke! I was subconsciously seeking friendships with people who smoke! As a result over the decade the friends I have are smokers. I recently got in touch with a few old friends who don't smoke and I found out I have more command with them than the people I meet everyday just for a smoke.

This me breaking the cycle. This is me getting rid of toxic relationships based on smoking!


Sorry for the stupid realization.
I just wanted to share this with someone.

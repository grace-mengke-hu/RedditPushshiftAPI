Smoke Stop : Episode MIV : A New Hope

Again, I will try to stop smoking. 

Had some bad news in the family, cases of COPD, which shook me awake. 

Also, my girlfriend and I are talking serious about buying a house and having kids, so I really have to quit to be a good example (and I don't want to ruin our house with smokestained curtains...). She is also trying to quit since today, so it's really great to have her support.

For the start, I will use nicotine patches to help me, but I hope to lose these soon.
So far, the first 4 hours of quitting went great (I know 4 hours is peanuts, but it's a start), and the only cravings I had were out of habit. 

So fingers crossed and let's do this!

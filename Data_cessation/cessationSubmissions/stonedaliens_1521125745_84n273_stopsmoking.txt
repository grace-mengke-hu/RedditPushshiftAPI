I’ve finally reached my breaking point and it feels incredible!

I stopped smoking about a month ago; I’ve substituted cigarettes for a vape and all has been going very well. I went out with some friends this weekend, and when I drink, I crave cigarettes like crazy. I was feeling great and had one of my cravings, so I figured I’d give it a try. I smoked a Parliament menthol (gag) and directly after my last drag, I projectile vomited everywhere. I ended up feeling extremely sick for the rest of the night and the day after. Every time I think about cigarettes now, I think about how disgusting I felt after smoking just one. It was an experience that I needed to have, and I am so excited to stay committed to being cigarette free!

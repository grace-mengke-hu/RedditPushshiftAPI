1 day in, post-relapse after 4 months

I quit for 4 months and got back on nicotine for about 2 weeks. 

Common story: big time stress one day. Thought a cigarette might help. That turned into 2 weeks of hell. 

I was doing the whole secret smoking thing. I hope you've never done it. It's really quite awful. I would get up in the morning and hurriedly leave the house to buy a pack of smokes. I'd smoke one first-thing. I'd smoke one an hour later, then another, then another, until about midday. 

After that, I'd abstain until the next day. These were stressful evening where I didn't do anything. I felt I couldn't. I was too anxious not having nicotine, too depressed about my relapse. Then I decided I need to get off again. But why'd I go back?

I knew I had to figure out my reason for relapsing to correct it and make sure it didn't happen again. 

My initial method of quitting was Allen Carr's Easyway. However, I didn't hold it in my behavior. I wasn't proud to be a nonsmoker. I slipped into feeling deprived. I needed to reaffirm that I was in fact depriving myself **BY** smoking. 

I read the entire Easyway book over. It helped me fully realize the trap again and see my way out of it. 

I'm back on day 1 but more confident than ever!

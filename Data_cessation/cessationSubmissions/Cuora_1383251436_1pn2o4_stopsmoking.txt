Day 23, yesterday was rough, need some support..

Day 23, going strong (no slip ups) but last night was really rough. Basically I was submitting an aplication for my Masters. Wanted to smoke the whole time.

Last night I had a dream that somebody passed me a cigarette and I took a puff. Felt like a failure. Arrrgh.

How is everybody else going?

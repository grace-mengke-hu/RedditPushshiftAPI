Had a Few Drinks... Didn't Smoke!!

Just wanted to brag a bit that I had several drinks the other day at a bar, and didn't feel the urge to smoke. I hung out with smokers and drinkers in their natural habitat, and didn't go outside to light up. 

Guys and gals, this is a huge accomplishment for me. Having a drink at a social event always equated to smoking. Not now. I feel like I can live a normal life without smoking and I fucking love it. 

Has anyone else had any recent success where you endured a situation without smoking (and still had fun!)?

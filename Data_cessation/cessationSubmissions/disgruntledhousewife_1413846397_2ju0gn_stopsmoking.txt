Quitting again, ready to punch someone

I ended up quitting this weekend after drinking too much on friday and suffering a hangover. I've been toying with the idea of quitting anyways (sooner or later it has to happen, right?) 

My biggest problem is whenever I talk about quitting, I get a lot of meaningful advice from people who don't fucking get it. I hear stories about how they just walked away, quit cold turkey, and never looked back. Congraufuckinglations, it's never been that easy for me. I've quit 3 times in the past, and always have started up again. 

So day 3 more or less, my husband took my wallet unannouced today (so I wouldn't sneak off while he was at work and buy a pack, which I did try. I tried. luckily my state is crazy about IDing people and despite the fact I'm in my 30s refused to sell me with out ID) I even caught myself fantasizing about mugging someone I saw with a cigarette. 

It's got to get easier right? am I doing something wrong? My therapist today (who specializes in addiction) said it really is up there with heroin. Another thing for me is that I can't eat. I can't. Eating is a HUGE trigger for me, since I usually always smoke after eating. I've been trying to just take little snack breaks all day, so I don't get up starving, but I'm fearing for dinner time. I have kids, not cooking dinner is not an option.

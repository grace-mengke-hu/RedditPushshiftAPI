After 1o years

begin wall of text...

This summer marked my 10th year of smoking.  I have been trying to quit for at least six of those years.  I lost track of how many times I have stopped only to relapse.  At the shortest it has been a day and at the longest it has been months.  It has gotten to the point that I cant tell anyone. 
  I cant talk to my FW about it.  Avoiding this fight seems to be the only thing she cares about.  She cant understand why I smoke, or why it is so hard.  So every time I relapse we have a huge fight.  So for a while I only smoked M-F.  My efforts mean little to my coworkers and my family is fatigued.   I am afraid to mention anything to them because I think they will feel used.
  I am glad this reddit exits. It has given me the support I need to know that this time I am not just waiting till an "understandable" time to relapse.  When you quit and you are surrounded by non smokers, they don't grasp the cycle of self loathing it causes. I am glad I found this place, and am enjoying the Easy Way.  It is a refreshing validation of what I have been experiencing. 
I'm done.  Thanks!

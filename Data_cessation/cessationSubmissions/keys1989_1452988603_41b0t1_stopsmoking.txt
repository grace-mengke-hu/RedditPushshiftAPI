Recently quit. This past Tuesday to be precise.

Right, after nearly 13 years I've recently quit smoking, this past Tuesday (12th Jan 2016) to be precise. Any way, with only a vaporiser to use to help kick the urges. Tonight, I had my first ciggie since quitting. I feel awful that I had it, and feel like I've let me self down. But on the plus side, that cigarette was the worst cigarettes I ever had. So I guess in a way, it was a blessing in disguise. To remind me that I don't need those horrible sticks. And I am stronger than them, and can quit this awful addiction. 
Sorry for the information, this just felt like the place to share.

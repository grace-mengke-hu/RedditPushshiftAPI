Apps as tools to not smoke

Right after I quit smoking, I put Smoke Free on my Android. When I'm in a trigger situation and need a fast reminder, I find having this on my phone to be helpful.

I like that it shows me time, money saved, health stuff, & that it's easy to use.

Is anyone else using an app? Which and why?

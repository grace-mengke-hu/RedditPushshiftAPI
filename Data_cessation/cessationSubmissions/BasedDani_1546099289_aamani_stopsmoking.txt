How, when and why did you start smoking?

I'm just interested on why, when and how you started smoking. The reasons to quit are obvious but I'd guess most of you started to smoke only at parties and when you're stressed out.

I personally only smoke when I'm feeling well and that for about half a year. I'd say 15 cigarettes in 6 months or something.

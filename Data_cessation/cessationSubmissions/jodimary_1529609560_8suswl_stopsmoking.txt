Feeling sorry for myself? Day 3

Hi all,

Reading through this sub has been really helpful! I made a sudden attempt to quit smoking cold turkey after 8 years a few days ago. I'm reaching the end of day 3 and am feeling okay. The cravings have subsided a little, probably because I am eating more unfortunately. 
However, I am just so tired. My sleep is terrible and I have to nap in the day. The main issue is that I feel like I'm in a bubble or a dream and feel a little like a zombie. It's as though I am not truly in my life but watching from elsewhere. It is probably the fatigue, but this physical feeling is really getting to me and then I think about smoking again.

Has anyone felt like this? Will this pass? Sorry I just feel so unlike myself and I cannot enjoy being free of this awful drug whilst I feel this way. I feel as though i can't carry on doing my usual daily activities and chores. 

Thanks in advance :)

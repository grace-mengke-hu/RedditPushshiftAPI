I smoked a few hours ago. I'd like it to be my last.

I've been smoking for about six years. I'm excited to make a change but a little nervous about getting through the next few days. Any tips or suggestions would be great, but really I just wanted to check in and say hi. 

I don't expect it to be easy but I know it can be done.

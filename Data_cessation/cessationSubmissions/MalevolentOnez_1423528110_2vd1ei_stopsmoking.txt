Coming up on my one year

Honestly, it's amazing how fast this past year has gone by. I can barely remember myself as a smoker. I can honestly say that I am so much happier living my life without cigarettes. I just want everyone to know it does get easier with time. In the beginning it may seem daunting, like it is never going to get easier, but it does. At 364 days I rarely think about smoking a cigarette, maybe only once a month if that, and the thought only lasts for a few seconds. Hang in there everybody and good luck.

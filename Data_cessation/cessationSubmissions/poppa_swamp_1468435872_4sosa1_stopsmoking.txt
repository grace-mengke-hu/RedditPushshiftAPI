Quitting E cig

Hello all,

I've been off cigarettes for awhile now but still addicted to my ecig/nicotine. I like the e cig for breaks during coding and it helps me concentrate. It's just annoying being addicted and i need to work on getting my anxiety lower for the upcoming school semester. Will cutting nicotine help with my anxiety?

Newbie questions about Technicalities

If I finished my last cig on Friday night at 8pm, is Friday day one for me or is Saturday? I mean Friday wasn't a full day

Also what app is everyone using with the light green color theme?

Also does anyone think it's possible to have one smoke after dinner? hahahaha I'm feeling weak but I'm pretty sure the answer for me is NO

My little failure story.

I didn't have any sort of nicotine product for 4 months. I was in way better shape and had much more energy. I didn't even remember what it was like to want one. Well, I was chatting with a young lady at a coffee place, and when she went out to smoke, I figured "I've got this under control. I can have just one and it will be no problem." Well, you all can guess what happened. I still believe in the Alan Carr program, and am going to reread his book. I'm confidant that I can quit again. I just need to remember that I can't have 'just one'.

Withdrawl onset

I stopped smoking cigs with the help of an ecig. The problem was I smoked that even more than cigarettes because it was so easy and lowkey. Then I tried to use a vape to get off the ecig. Decided to quit altogether and gave my vape away because I was using it too much. I slipped up and bought some refills for my ecig a while ago and I want to get some more. I know I shouldnt but I havent had even probably a quarter of the nicotine I usually do today (I chewed some 2 mg gum earlier) and I feel like absolute shit. Full withdrawl is hitting me and I have work at 5am tomorrow. I have some more 2/4mg gum still but I feel like it doesn't help at all. Currently losing my mind what do

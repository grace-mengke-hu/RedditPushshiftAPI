Day 2 and I'm up and down, but NOT SMOKING!

Hey guys!  I'm a non-smoker again.   I lasted 2 years away from the demon weed until about 8 months ago I figured "hey I am non-addicted enough to have one or two at a bar every now and then"

Turns out no.... no I can't.  I was back to a pack a day within a few weeks.  It doesn't help that I live in a country that still glorifies smoking and it's easy and affordable here.  

My boyfriend decided to jump on the quit bandwagon with me.  He's doing suspiciously better than I am, but we're both staying strong.  

Anyways I just wanted to say hi and thank everyone for their support.   I'm a wishywashy ball of nerves right now, but otherwise ok.

Stay strong people!

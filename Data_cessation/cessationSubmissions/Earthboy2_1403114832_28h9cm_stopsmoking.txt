I'm quitting, it's day 5!

I made the decision to quit 5 days ago and all is going well, I feel really great about myself for making this decision and I have total confidence in myself that I can do it. Well, I only really smoked for about 7-9 months and before that in joints, which doesn't seem like a long time to me, but that doesn't really matter. Good luck to all who want to quit! :)

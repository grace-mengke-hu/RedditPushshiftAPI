100 days!

I woke up this morning all excited and proud.  I checked my badge on this subreddit first thing to make sure I was right and smiled like a little kid.  

I spent the day making people congratulate me and seeing lots of surprised faces at work because 101 days ago I smoked like a freight train.

That's it really.  I just wanted to post something marking the occasion.  I'm thankful for this subreddit and the unending support within it.

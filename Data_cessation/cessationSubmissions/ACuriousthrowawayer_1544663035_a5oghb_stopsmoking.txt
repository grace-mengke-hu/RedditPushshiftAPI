Honestly is the nicotine buzz worth the risk?

I am using a throwaway for this as I am afraid this question may come across as a little dumb. 
I have never smoked in my life and am wondering if the reward one gets from smoking outways the risk of getting all these terrible smoking related diseases that can occur? 

I am not trying to spread an anti smoking campaign or look down on anyone who smokes because I have my own vice in alcohol. Iâ€™m just honestly curious. Is it worth it? Is the nicotine buzz all its cracked up to be? Or should I take the advice of many people who have quit smoking and never start?

Day 2. I had almost 2 years under my belt when I started up again. Lesson learned. NOT EVEN ONE!

I was back to my pack and a half a day within a week. 

I never should have unsubbed from this group as it was always a good reminder, yet I got annoyed by it I guess.

How is everyone doing?

Time to reset my badge.

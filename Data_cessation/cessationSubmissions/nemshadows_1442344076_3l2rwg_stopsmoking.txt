Reset my badge, again...

I keep doing so well, then forgetting about this place for a month or so, then the odd one here, and the odd one there turns back into 2 before work, two on my break, two on the way home, two after lunch etc...

I'm going to try again soon, I don't have anyone around me that smokes anymore, not like at University, the only people around me are my sensible colleagues who never got into this shit in the first place.

I don't even think I can quit anymore. I've tried so many times and failed.

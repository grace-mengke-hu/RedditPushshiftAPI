I want to pick up smoking again for the exam period.

Hey guys,

I have stayed quit for 4 months but lately, I found myself thinking about smoking again and again cause of exams and family problems. A couple of days ago I was drinking at the bar with my friends and... no I didnt smoke but I was sitting with cigarette in my mouth unable to light it up for good 30 minutes. Today I gave in to cravings and smoked 2 cigarettes. Now Im feeling guily but sort of thinking to pick up the habit again until exams are over. 
In the back of my mind I know its a bad idea. But here I am sitting and arguing with myself instead of studying. 

Also one thing really scares me, just in a matter of minutes I gave up on 4 months progress (being completely sober mind you). Now it seems like I won`t ever be able to fully quit.(it`s not my first attepmt either) Only stop for sometime.

I just wanted to let it out to be honest, thanks for reading.

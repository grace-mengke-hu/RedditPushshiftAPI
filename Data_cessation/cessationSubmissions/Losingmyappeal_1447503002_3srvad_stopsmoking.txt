3 Days. Some major hurdles overcome.

Gave up on Wednesday night. My cravings had been manageable  for the first 48 hours. Last night was the 4th anniversary of my mother's death. I offered to cook a meal for 20 of her side of the family. Stressful. There was also wine involved. I was cautiously optimistic about getting through it but I was definitely anticipating my toughest challenge to date. Got through it with a few minor pangs. Kept telling myself that it wasn't me feeling deprived or irritable but the shitty little nicotine monster inside me. That guy just needs to be starved completely and I'll be rid of him. He's getting weaker every minute I don't feed him with nicotine. Take that monster.

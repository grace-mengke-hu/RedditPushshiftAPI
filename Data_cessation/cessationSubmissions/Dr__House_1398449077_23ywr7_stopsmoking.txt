I'm 2 weeks into being a non smoker and I'd like to share some of the things I got out of Allen Carrs fantastic book on this subject.

**EDIT: This post contains explicit language which may be considered NSFW.**

First I'd like to say I consider myself a skeptic. I'm a man of science, dammit. Most self help books are bunk. They're bullshit. *Most* of them. GMO foods are good for society as a whole, fluoride in tap water keeps the dental health of the poor somewhat better than it would be. Most self help books are garbage.

But Allen Carrs Easyway to stop smoking (a book I admittedly pirated on my tablet and now plan to buy multiple copies of for my family) is different. It just works. There's no other way of putting it.

I smoked for 13 years. I had all sorts of medical complications specifically related to my lungs over the years including a series of [spontaneous pneumothoax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumothorax). Those are not fun. I had a lot of them. I smoked through all of them.

I tried a lot of things per the advice of my doctor. Patches, gum, Champix... They kept me off for a while when I tried them but eventually I was back to smoking due to some trigger or some other dumb reason. I had been a member of this subreddit for smoking cessation for at least a year or two and I recently decided to take things seriously.

I did some looking around in the sub and the #1 recommendation I kept coming across was this one book. My Skeptical alarms went off -- "these self helpers think they can cure crippling addiction with a silly book! Whats wrong with them!" The numbers however started to add up and could not be ignored. When a majority of a community is telling you something worked for them, you have to try it. You have to, if for no other reason than to at least say "yeah I read the book everyone talks about, and its bullshit just like I thought".

Well, it wasn't bullshit. That shit actually worked. I'm still in disbelief the power a book has had in helping me to quit smoking. I still can't believe it. But I can feel it. I am now 100% confident I'll *never smoke another cigarette in my life*. I'm over it. It was easy. Why didn't I read this book 5 years ago? Guess who has a doctors appointment soon? This guy does, me. I'm taking a copy of the book with me to show my doctor, to ask him why didn't he offer this to me.

Some takeaways I got from the book, things you will learn about if you read it:

* We don't cure alcoholism with beer. We don't give cocaine addicts more cocaine to get over their cocaine problem. Why do we give nicotine addicts more nicotine in the form of gum/patches to get over their nicotine problem? That's just silly.

* Smoking does not relieve your stress. On the contrary sir or madam; smoking and your addiction to it is the very *root* of that stress you claim to be relieving. 

* Becoming a non-smoker is remarkably easy once you get over the brain washing involved in being an active smoker. All you have to do is not do something anymore. Don't call it quitting either -- the idea of 'quitting' something leaves too much room to go back to starting again (opinion).

* You probably eat a lot less than your body would like you do, because smoking does in fact have a negative impact on your appetite.

* You're a smoker? Then you have no idea what energy is. You have no idea what waking up in the morning and being hungry for breakfast feels like. You have no idea what it feels like to inhale a full clean breath of air deep into your lungs. Or perhaps you do, and you long to feel like that again.

* When you first started smoking it was horrible. Do you remember how bad it was? You had to train yourself to like it. It took a lot of time and training to eventually get addicted.

* I pity smokers now.

More on that last point: Every other time I had quit smoking in the past I had felt SERIOUS envy when I was near a smoker. "Oh man, that lucky son of a bitch" I would say to myself "I wish I could smoke, he looks like he's really enjoying that shit". The reality is, that smokers envy non-smokers -- so why should I as a new non-smoker envy them back? They're paying out the ass to put poison into their bodies in the form of heated plant matter entering their breathing organs - organs used and essential to life itself. No envy is left for them after reading the book, no sir. Only pity. I pity all the smokers amongst my friends and family. I pity their smell. I pity the fact their lives revolve around when they can suck on their next cancer stick. I pity the fact they pay out the ass for the privilege. There is nothing remaining for me to envy in them.

I quit smoking cold turkey from 1.5 packs per day to zero. My roommate is a chain smoker. It did not make it any more difficult. On the contrary, it was actually *extremely easy to do*. If you're subbed to this subreddit because your thinking about quitting, or procrastinating, fucking stop that shit, man the fuck up and quit. Read the book. It can guide you out of the brainwashing that is being an addicted cigarette smoker.

Coffee in the morning used to be my biggest trigger. I would *need* that smoke to go with my coffee. I just sat here and drank my morning coffee while writing this post out. Whats a craving? I don't have those anymore. What I do have, is money in my bank account.

TLDR: If you quit smoking, within 3 days you'll notice a massive increase in taste and smell perception; and clearer breathing. 

Edit: You don't count the days/hours you quit. I didn't, I did every previous time but not this one. I find it irrelevant. The 2 weeks is an estimation. I did tag the date and time with an android app on my tablet, checking it now it tells me I last smoked 16 days and 13 hours ago. You may find those numbers to be somewhat interesting. They mean absolutely nothing to me. This is the first time I've checked on what their values are since I stopped smoking. Thought you guys would like to know, I dont sit there counting the days. I dont feel any cravings. I don't feel any envy for smokers. I'm just a regular non-smoker now.

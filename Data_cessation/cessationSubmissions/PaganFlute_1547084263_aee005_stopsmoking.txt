20 days without smoking!

Okay, I lit one cigarette on NYE to celebrate, but just one. And it didn't even feel that good.

It's sort of worrisome how easy it was quitting this time?

Anyway, I feel great. The coughing is slowly stopping, I can briskly breathe in without having a coughing fit, I feel clean, not that tired and groggy all the time, my mouth doesn't taste gross other than normal mouth taste etc. 
I miss it when I see other people smoke, but it's super brief and faint.

Yay!

I can do this.

Okay. I JUST started smoking again last week. I quit 4 months ago but started having the odd one when I was drinking alcohol. Then I bought a pack and have been having about 4-5 a day for a week. I feel like I should quit while I’m ahead. I need to hold myself accountable and quit for good. I need to tell myself I will NEVER smoke again. This is so hard because I honestly feel like it’s the only true break I get during the day. I can’t quit trying to quit. I have to do this.

Struggling

I set my mind on stopping when I hit 35. I've been smoking since 15 and easily pack a day for at least the last ten years. I made a few half hearted attempts in the past but only lasted a week at the longest. Now I felt I was ready. Few days after I hit 35, I stopped and it came surprisingly easy as I was really motivated. After two weeks, feeling confident, I made the basic and common mistake of smoking "just one" when out having drinks. A couple of days later, I was back to my regular amount, binged for a week, then stopped again, having 1-2 cigarettes a day. I know that I will be back to the same amounts soon if I don't stop completely, as it's all or nothing for me when it comes to smoking. Starting to feel helpless and miserable, resetting my quit date again and again. Not sure if I'm expecting any advice from you all but I thought that perhaps sharing this might help, just throwing it out there.. I've already read a few things on here that really struck a chord so thanks!!!

Will I always be a slave to nicotine?

I’ve been smoke free for about 3 months. I’ve been doing GREAT. A few cravings here and there but I have been able to get through them. 

Then tonight after dinner a pang hit me so hard. I started thinking about how it’s getting warmer outside and how I’ll miss the breaks at work going outside during the summer, etc. I almost broke down.

I just want to be over this “slavery” - smoking is always in the back of my mind. Will it always been a hovering thought? Does any one truly get over smoking once they start?

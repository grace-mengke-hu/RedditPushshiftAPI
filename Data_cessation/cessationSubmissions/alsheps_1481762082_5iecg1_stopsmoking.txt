3 Days in, does time really pass this slow when you aren't smoking?

Hi all, Had my last smoke on Monday afternoon, and have been pretty good so far, even though my entire body is screaming for a cigarette, I haven't had one. This is after at least a 20 year, 25+ a day habit.  
  
But I'm noticing that time is really dragging on, the whole minutes feel like hours thing, I've never experienced this before, when time started to drag on, I'd just go out for a cigarette. How the hell do people do this all the time?

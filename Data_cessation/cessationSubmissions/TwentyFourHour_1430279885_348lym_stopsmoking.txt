Day One and I Need Some Advice

Just some background first.  
I'm 18 and smoke roughly a pack of week. I started smoking probably about 3 years ago, and have taken up to 3 or 4 months off once or twice since then. I recently started attending university and realized that I immediately began smoking more and more. This I feel is mainly due to the friend group I found, most of whom smoke as much if not more than me. As I'm really trying to make this time stick, is there an easy way to still hang out with them while they smoke? I'd say about 40% of our best times occur when we're smoking or around people smoking. Any tips to help take some of the stress off of my mental will when around friends who are smoking?

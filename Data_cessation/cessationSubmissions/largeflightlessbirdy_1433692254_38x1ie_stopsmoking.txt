Enjoying having a working nose

It's only been a week, but my sense of smell has come rocketing back. Prior to smoking I had quite a strong sense of smell and I hadn't realised until now that I had lost it completely. 

I'm making shortbread at the moment, it is in the oven and I am in a different room in the house entirely but I can smell it from way over here. It's a gorgeous smell, hopefully it will linger around the home once the shortbread is fully cooked!

I'm making a pizza for dinner tonight, I can't wait to smell it. It's been years since I was able to smell a fresh pizza!

If you feel yourself wavering then keep at it! The non-smoking experience comes with too many great perks to name them all, but sooner or later I think we all have those moments where we do something we couldn't really do as a smoker and it blows our minds a bit. 

Those moments where smelling shortbread cooking a few rooms over feels like a superpower :P

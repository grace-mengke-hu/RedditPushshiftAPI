Quitting while sick

I got bronchitis for the first time ever.  Iâ€™m 33 and have been smoking since I was 16 with a five year gap when I was able to quit cold turkey the first time before I stupidly started again.  This bronchitis was probably for the best as I am now dedicated to quitting and it also really just sucks.  My problem- what I came here for advice on- is that I want to make sure this is just bronchitis and not something more sinister.  What kind of doctor do I need to go see first? My gp or can I just go straight to a pulmonary specialist?  Any insights appreciated.  Has anyone else gotten checked out while quitting, just to be sure?

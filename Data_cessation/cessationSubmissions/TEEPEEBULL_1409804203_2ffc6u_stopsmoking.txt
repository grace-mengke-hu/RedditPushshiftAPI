What Could Possibly Be Worse Than This?

I'm thinking...too much perhaps at this point...but as I expected there would be a debate betwen my addicted head and my resonable one.
Nonetheless- smoking has the allure right now because I have presented it to my self in a manner of logic that weather debate rages on due to the benefit/affliction and detriment of it argument...there is no matter at this point in my life at 52 years old to try to make amends now- as they are impossible to my logic.I'm thinking all the damage is done. My body must have suffered too much from 30+ years of smoke. Does anyone know what is the difference at this point? If there is any?

Now I'm motivated

I've never really cared about my own well-being a lot. But last Monday it occurred to me that my girlfriend, who's a casual smoker, started smoking quite a lot. She went from a pack every couple of months to a pack a week...

She usually smokes when she's around other smokers, since she's constantly with me it means that I've got a lot of influence on her habit. I'm not going to watch her get addicted, although she says that she's got it under control, like everyone of us thought at a certain moment. I quit Tuesday morning, after I saw her light one up every time I did Monday night.

I've already tried to quit a couple of times, but this time is different, I'm not only doing it for myself. She helps me think whenever I want to walk into a shop and buy a pack and she doesn't smoke anymore herself. This time I'm not going to fail.

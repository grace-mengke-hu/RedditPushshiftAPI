For all those quitting today, or thinking about quitting.

I know I'm only 20 days in, and it's still early, and I've still got a long way to go...
But let me tell you from 20 days in...
I am happier than I have ever been in  years. I always seemed to blame not quitting smoking on depression and waiting till a better time, maybe waiting for a girl, waiting for a big event...thinking I'll quit then. It will be easier. Bollocks to every set of reasons you give yourself to put another cig in your mouth, bollocks to the lot of them. 20 days ago I said enough is enough and 
20 days in I am waking up happier than ever.

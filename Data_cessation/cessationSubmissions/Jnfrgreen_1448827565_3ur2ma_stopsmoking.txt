Quitting leading to depression?

I've been smoke free for 10 of the hardest days of my life. Days 1-3 and 6-7 were ok, but every other day has felt like torture. The last 3 days have been terrible and I think I'm experiencing depression now. I feel n like I've lost my best friend. I just want to smoke cause it will numb all this uselessness. Has anyone else had this experience when quitting? How long does it last. If it lasts much longer I don't know if I can make it.

A few thoughts from a smoker quitting

I've been following this sub for a couple of weeks, which is about as long as I've not been smoking.

Feeling a "craving" for the past hour or more so I thought I'd do some writing to you.

Every now and then today I feel like I could go to the store and buy a pack; it's not far to drive. But practically every morning I wake up, I feel glad I didn't crack the day before - I don't feel like crap in the morning since I stopped. I don't have that ashy feeling in my chest.

I definitely can smell more acutely lately. I've noticed an odd thing; flavors taste sweeter. In fact sometimes I get a sweet taste in my mouth, it seems, for no reason at all.

I have been drinking more beer than usual. And eating more than usual. In fact, my ability to know when to stop eating and drinking isn't as refined as it was when I was smoking.

Definitely have more of a temper lately. It's not out of my control, but certainly I am less patient. 

I think about smoking all of the time. I genuinely enjoy tobacco. I miss the feeling of filling up my lungs with smoke, especially. I'm trying to remember, though, the guilt I felt all the time when smoking. Getting winded walking up the stairs. Getting a headache after smoking half a pack. Feeling like crap on a daily basis. 

I'm trying to remember what people say: "One day at a time."

Day One starts... Now.

Title says it. I set that at the end of this day I would quit about a week and a half ago. This is second time I have seriously tried to quit. I'm sick of the love/hate dichotomy I have, and the fallacious logic my brain creates with cigarettes. I am done. Non-smokers aren't like, "you know what would go great with this coffee/meal/postcoital relaxation? A cigarette." And as of right now, I'm a non-smoker.

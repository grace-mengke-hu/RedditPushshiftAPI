3+ months

It's actually been a bit more than 3 months since I totally quit.  I didn't even notice.  First month felt like a big deal, 2nd month was like "I'm kinda annoyed I still think about smoking", 3rd month I literally forgot.

I had 1 cigarette at a bar while drunk last month with my buddy.  Decided not to feel guilty about it and just move on with life.

The biggest "I'm free" moment was at Walgreens last week.  Stood in line in front of the wall o' smokes for like 5 minutes. My brand was front and center.  Not a single part of me was like "oh man lets just have one smoke, it's been months, it won't hurt."  I was just like "damn, it's nice not to spend $9 to kill myself and smell like shit."

I was never a HEAVY smoker, so it's probably easier for me.  Mostly I was a 2 pack/week guy for about 6 years.  At worst I'd smoke like half a pack a day, in better times I'd smoke 2-3 per day.  The 6 months before I quit I got myself down to 1 or 2 per day, but when I was stressed I'd chain smoke.

**I was worried I'd always miss smoking, or have to constantly think DON'T SMOKE.  I don't anymore.**  There's still the possibility that I will go back if I get very very depressed again, but at least I know I can get the monkey off my back completely.  Even if the monkey is still out there waiting in the weeds.

23 Days & 23 Days Left (Comparison)

I remember being at 23 days smoke free. Now, I'm 23 days from being at 1 year. 

It is a world of difference. I don't get sick as much, I can run 5k races and not get winded. I blew up a small beach ball in ONE FREAKING BREATH. I can scream along with my favorite metal bands and keep the scream going as long as them.

Anyone that reads this, keep it up. Seriously, do NOT give up on it. Your life will transform, and you'll feel great. I've forgotten what 23 days felt like, but I know what 23 from 1 year feels like. It's great.

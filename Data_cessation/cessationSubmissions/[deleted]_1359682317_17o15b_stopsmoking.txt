Oh man, just realized I have broken 1 month!!!

Just realized I passed the month mark!    
I am so incredibly proud of myself. I feel so much better, it's incredible!    
I have saved over $200, everything tastes better, I can smell with *much* intensity, have so much more energy, am infinitely less irritable, and just go outside less in the winter!   
Keep at it people, it's so worth it.

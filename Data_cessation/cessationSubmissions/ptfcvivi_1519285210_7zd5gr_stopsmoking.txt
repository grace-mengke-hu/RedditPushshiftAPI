635 days down, 1 to go

I fucked it up today. 635 days thrown away. I know should be proud of that accomplishment but I'm just feeling deeply ashamed. Shame got me into this place initially  and it's really making me want to use nicotine more. Since that is off the table, I'm feeling anxious and angry. Tomorrow will be a new day. I will feel better eventually. Please, everyone, don't let hubris get the better of you. No nicotine, not a little bit, not once, not ever.

I am only 20 years old and my lung just collapsed

I have been vaping for the last couple years, I was in the middle of work when it felt like I was having a heart attack. Luckily only a small portion of my lung collapsed but it was a very painful experience. I have been wanting to stop for a while now and this is the wake up call I really needed! I hope to enjoy a long healthy life and I canâ€™t do it with nicotine by my side!

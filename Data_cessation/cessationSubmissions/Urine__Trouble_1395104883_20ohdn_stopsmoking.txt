Out of something bad may come something good.....

March 4th my boyfriend had a heart attack in our bathroom and me and my 17 year old son spent roughly 18 minutes doing chest compressions while we waited for the ambulance. He died 2 days later...the damage was too severe. He would have been 50 April 10th. The doctors said his smoking played a huge factor in his having a heart attack. He wasnt overweight or a terrible eater. His father has had a few heart attacks but is still alive at 76 years old. My boyfriend had not been to the doctor in several years and was very "old school" so he may have had some other underlying problems but he was a lifelong smoker....and by lifelong i mean he picked up his first cigarette at 6 years old.....6 YEARS OLD !!!! Can you imagine ?? 
The afternoon he went into the hospital I didnt smoke until the day we buried him and I got drunk and smoked.....but I havent smoked since and I hope I never smoke again. I mean I know I can NEVER touch them again because It's so easy for me to start again.  Im 43 years old and have 2 teenage sons who need a mom around to keep 'em straight. I dont want to intentionally shorten my life any longer. 
Im doing it cold turkey....I dont need another crutch and frankly I think it would just be to easy for me to transition BACK to smoking if i was vaping. I have to accept that smoking is my weakness and I dont make rational decisions so I just need to stay away from all things similar to that.
Anyway...I really miss my boyfriend and Im going to honor him by putting an end to that bad habit.

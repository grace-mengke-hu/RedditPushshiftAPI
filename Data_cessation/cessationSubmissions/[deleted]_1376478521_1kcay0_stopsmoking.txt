Starting again

Last friday, what should have been a 1 hour flight, ended with me being stuck in an airport for 12 hours. I snapped at hour 6 and bought myself a pack of cigarettes. I then thought "fuck it" and smoked another two decks over the weekend, while I was in a different state for work. I didn't even enjoy smoking them.

I haven't told my friends or my girlfriend that I smoked, because I don't want my quitting to be an ongoing saga, or to make a big deal out of it - but I think it'd make sense to be honest about it here.

So here's me starting again!

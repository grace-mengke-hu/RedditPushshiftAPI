Almost a month and a half with no cigs and I couldn’t feel better.

Stopped smoking a month and a half ago and switched to vaping. I’m no longer winded after simply going up the stairs and my bodies been coughing up a shit ton of mucus which I assume is my lungs cleaning themselves out after the years of abuse I put them through. Good luck to anybody else on this journey. Fuck cigs.

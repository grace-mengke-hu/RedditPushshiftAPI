1000

Yesterday I did not smoke my 1000th cigarette. It kind of blows my mind when I try to picture how much tobacco 1000 cigarettes add up to, and imagining smoking all of that. I'm so glad I didn't!

To all of those who struggle : hang on! It's hard, but you can do it. And even if you slip, you can continue quitting. Cheers to all!

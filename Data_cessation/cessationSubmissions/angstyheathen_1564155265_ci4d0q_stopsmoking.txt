Today’s little win

I quit about a month or so ago and switched to vaping, still not nicotine free but I’m okay with the fact that it’s a lot healthier. Baby steps. 

Regardless, I stepped outside with two smoker friends today and didn’t feel any cravings while they smoked. This is the longest “quit” thus far and the first time I’ve gotten to the point where I can be around other smokers comfortably. 

Soon I’m hoping to be nicotine free, but for the time being I’m celebrating these little wins. Best of luck to everyone in their quits!

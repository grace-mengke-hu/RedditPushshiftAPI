Day four, and I want to eat everything in sight.

Smoker for two years, chain vaper for one. Broke my vape Monday and didn't have money to fix it so I was like, "Fuck it, I guess I'm quitting." 

Tuesday was awful. Felt like I went all day with only half my leg or something. Cussed out my family, didn't speak to anyone at work. Went and bought a bunch of jolly ranchers that I've been nursing on and it's helped a lot. 

I'm now finding I want to eat everything in sight. All those, "Well, time for a vape break," has turned into snack breaks. Bleh, it's almost making me just want to keep vaping honestly, even though the cravings for it are virtually gone. I just never realized it's probably a big reason why I never had to try very hard to stay at a good weight. 

Not really looking for advice really. Just want to commiserate. I figure maybe Monday after I've been in the green a week, I can start being concerned about it.

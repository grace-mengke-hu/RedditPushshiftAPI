Stopping on monday

I have decided that I am stopping on monday, I have a few fags left and I am working over this weekend and usually have a smoke after work (I work in a bar) so I am stopping completely on monday along with one of my friends. Although I havnt been smoking for long only about 4 years and dont smoke much say 20 every 2-3 days ive decided to completely stop. I've got myself a money jar and every 2 days im going to put in a tenner which i would have spent on smokes and every 3 months im going to open that jar and buy myself something nice with it. Wish me luck and I'll be giving you daily then weekly then monthly and hopefully yearly updates of how i am getting on. Is there any tips you guys can give me as im just going cold turkey?

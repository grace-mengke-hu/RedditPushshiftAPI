Question about Smoke Free App

I’ve noticed a lot of other people use this app as well so I thought this would be a good place to ask the question, since the Smoke Free FAQ is garbage. First off I have an iPhone. When I downloaded the app I paid five dollars, I can’t remember what the prompts that exactly, but I think it was for premium access to all the features. Since then I have been getting build an additional one dollar each week.  Has this been happening to anyone else? Is this supposed to happen? I tried going into the settings app like Smoke Free recommends, but I when I click acknowledgments nothing shows up. Help plz! I don’t care about the dollar, but I’m on a family sharing plan and my dad is annoyed by the emails he is getting lol

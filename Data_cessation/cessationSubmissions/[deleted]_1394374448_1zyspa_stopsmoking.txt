Quitting 2: Electric Boogaloo

Hi guys!

You were all super helpful on my last attempt- I made it 12 days during one of the most stressful periods of my life, and I'm proud. Last time it was exam time, I had major anxiety disorder issues, and I had just had a tooth extraction. Making it 12 days with all of that going on was awesome.

Now that things have calmed down, I'm doing it f'realz this time.

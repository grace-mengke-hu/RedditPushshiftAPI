5 days in and I guess I don’t sleep now

5 days in and generally have been doing well. Letting mood swings come and go and not having trouble resisting cravings. But there is one things that giving me trouble. 

I usually sleep very well. I’ve had periods in my life where that wasn’t always the case. I had an experience with a person that imparted on me the importance of sleep and ever since, Ive slept like a log. Until I quit smoking. For 5 straight nights I’ve slept little. This can’t be the new normal. 

I guess I need to step up the self care to promote sleep. Just wanting some encouragement that this too shall pass I guess.

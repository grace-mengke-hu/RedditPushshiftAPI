Day 1 again

So today is day one. I have tried to quit many times using patches and e cigs and even chantix. The last 3 weeks I have woken up feeling awful and realized today I had spent well over $15,000 in my lifetime on smoking. I can and will do it this time. I have been subscribed to this sub for a while, but I have seen many people thanking it for helping them quit. How do yall use this sub effectively to help quit?

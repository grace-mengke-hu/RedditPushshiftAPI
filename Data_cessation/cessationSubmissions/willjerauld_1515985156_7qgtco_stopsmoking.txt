1 week today! and feeling optimistic

I made it one week smoke free. This time has been significantly easier since I'm using a vape (reeeeally helping) I have not felt this good about quitting since I started! 22 year old smoked for 7 1/2 years. If I can nail this addiction now my body will thank me so much by the time im 30..

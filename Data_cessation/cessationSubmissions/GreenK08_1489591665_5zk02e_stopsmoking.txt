Mood swings

I haven't smoked in 30 days. I quit cold turkey. I'm proud of myself for that and the way my body feels. However, with that being said, I feel like I can go from one end of the spectrum to the other very quickly. I don't have much patience or tolerance for anyone since I quit smoking. Has anyone else experienced this? I don't know if it's a withdrawal symptom or what. I get mad so fast and I was a lot calmer when I smoked. Maybe I was never calm and smoking was how I handled it? Just looking for any advice or guidance. TIA.

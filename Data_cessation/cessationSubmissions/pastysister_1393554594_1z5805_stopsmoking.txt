I can do it! I can toke up while quitting cigs!

Was very nervous about smoking pot while quitting tobacco. Usually it's a huge trigger for me. But I've been a little on edge today, had some terrible cravings and just needed to chill the fuck out. So I took a hot bath while reading game of thrones and I did it. I feel so much better now.

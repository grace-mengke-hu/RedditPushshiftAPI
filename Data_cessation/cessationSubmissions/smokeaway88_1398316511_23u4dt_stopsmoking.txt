Cold turkey with a 0mg E-cig... just hit 72 hour mark.

Hi everyone,

I am a 25 year old pack-a-day smoker for about a year now. I have been smoking occasionally for 2 1/2 years prior.

Day 3 has been hell. I bought a 0mg e-cig to give me something to do and so far it has calmed me down. I love the ritual of smoking and it seems to be helping me out.

Any success stories with people going cold turkey and switching straight to 0mg Vapor to keep the 'ritual' side going? Looking for inspiration!

Quitting today

I've made a lot of positive lifestyle changes recently - i quit marijuana 3 weeks ago, have been eating much better, been watching my posture and trying to sleep better. I feel like I'm on a roll, and smoking has been on my list for a long time. Time to quit.

I just want to write down my plans here, so i can come back in times of weakness. Hopefully it will help some of you get through another day.

**Benefits of quitting**

1. Better breathing - my breathing is shallow and strained. My lungs will be healthier. I'll be able to take deep, full breaths in my new life. 

2. Better posture and less pain - bad breathing can end up causing lots of postural problems and stress. I'll be able to stand up straight and tall, be more confident and feel better in my new life.

3. My teeth and gums will be much better and won't bleed in my new life.

4. My sense of taste and smell will improve. I'll find food more delicious in my new life.

5. I'll be able to run and jog and play sports and feel the natural highs without becoming short of breath in my new life.

6. Less anxiety. Thanks to my improved breathing and reduced hyperventilation, I'll be calmer and happier in my new life.

7. Better sleep. I'll be able to sleep easily, more restfully and feel more energized and motivated throughout the day in my new life.

8. Better memory. Smokers lose 1/3rd of their working memory capacity. I'll be smarter, remember things more vividly and be able to connect with people better in my new life.

9. Better mood - I won't have frequent headaches or dizziness thanks to better posture, breathing and circulation in my new life.

10. More motivation - quitting smoking is pretty difficult. Knowing that i did it will make me more motivated, increase my self-esteem and make me more confident, outgoing and social.

**Things i will tell myself that aren't true:**

1. Just one won't hurt right? **No.** Just one resets your nicotine clock, meaning I'll have to go through withdrawal symptoms all over again, or worse, smoke for the rest of my life. Not worth it.

2. But life is really stressful/hard right now. Maybe its better to wait it out until things are a little less crazy, a better time - it will increase my chances of quitting! **No.** Life is always throwing new stresses at me, i've told myself that for 3 years now and never found a "better time". The best way to increase my chances of quitting are to not smoke today.

3. But I'm talking to friend X. I always smoke when I'm talking to him - whats wrong with another one for old times sake? **No.** I can enjoy talking to him without smoking too. Old times were bad times - don't go back. Go forward.

4. I just can't do this you know? Some people have more motivation and willpower. Maybe I should just smoke one, and then I'll start again with e-cigarettes next time to give me a better shot. **No.** Motivation is all in the mind. Knowing that I have beaten this habit will give me more motivation for the rest of my life. I have been through some shitty fucking times, i can do this. E-cigarettes are nicotine. That will reset my clock, then I'll be addicted to e-cigs for the rest of my life. Maybe they really are healthier, but they aren't risk-free.  It's not worth throwing away my progress so far. This will make me stronger.


**A craving only lasts 15 minutes. These are the strategies I will use to resist:**

1. Delay - just wait it out 15 minutes, repeat all the benefits to myself and imagine life in 6 weeks.

2. Drink water. Eat a carrot.

3. Deep breathing

4. Do something

5. Recognize and fucking destroy triggers - phone calls, walking around, a desire to get away from the current situation, hearing the word "cigarette", seeing someone smoke on TV or in life, talking to my smoker buddy. Just wait it out 15 minutes, get back to what i'm doing. If i can encounter the trigger 5 times and not give in, it will cease to be a trigger! 

6. Don't track things too closely. It may be day X since I last smoked, but no need to put that word in my mind again. Its just another day to get through, with all the stress, sadness, joy and growth it brings.

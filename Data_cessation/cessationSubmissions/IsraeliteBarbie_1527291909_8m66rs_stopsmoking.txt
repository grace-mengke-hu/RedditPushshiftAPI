day 35 and I am this [] close to smoking

honestly having one of the worst weeks of my life. and all i want to do is go get a pack of long newports and say fuck it. who gives a shit anymore. if it weren't for God I'd be smoking right now. Only because I don't want to defile my temple I haven't done it yet. The urge to be destructive is so strong. I've never felt like cutting in my entire life until now all because I can't smoke and made a promise to God. I don't feel good admitting this. I don't want to exercise anymore. I wanna burn my throat up and say fuck it all.

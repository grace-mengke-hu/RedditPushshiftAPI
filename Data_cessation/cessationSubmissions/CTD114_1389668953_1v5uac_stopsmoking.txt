Having a bad time.

Stop dipping 47 days ago and I was excited at first but the thoughts of dip and the stress and obsession over quitting hasn't gone away. I guess I keep thinking I am going to go back at some point but I don't want to.
I haven't had a moment of mental piece after a month and a half.
 
I also have been looking at quit dipping websites and there is so many posts that are about dippers that still want to have one after a long time of quitting. I'm wondering if quitting dip is different than smoking mentally since its in your mouth all the time and just worried Im gonna be in this state forever and feel awful the rest of my life.
I guess Im just kinda moping all the time and having a bad attitude.

I'm about to quit smoking.

I've smoked for a long time. Usually it's about 6 cigs a day.  I'm about to smoke my last cigarette and never buy another pack.  Please send me your good vibes.  It's time.  I'm fucking angry at myself for smoking for so long.  So. Angry.  I'm nervous and even scared.  It's pathetic.
 I have gum, I've been hitting the gym HARD for 50 days- I'm in great shape.  This is the last piece of the puzzle.  Please, send me your good vibes, I need them.  This is the hardest thing I've ever encountered.  I've been a fighter in rings with hard hitting dudes, worked out till I puked, ran a marathon, but I haven't ever had a harder time than this.  It's time. Sorry to be so dramatic, but it's killing me, it's aging me.  I wonder will I ever recover? It's aged me a good 5 Years as far as I can tell.  Just... yea.  It's a little emotional for me. Anyway, wish me luck.  I hope you all find the strength to quit, if you are struggling.  I had to write this down, somewhere.  If you're out there SEND ME YOUR STRENGTH.  WAAGMI.

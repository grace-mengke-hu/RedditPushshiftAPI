Quitting Again

I quit with the ecig September 2014. I went over a year without smoking, then went out one night in November and got drunk and bummed a cig from someone... One thing leads to another... bam I'm a pack a day again and have been for most of 2016.

I wanna quit again. But I don't feel the same motivation I had the last time I quit. I got my motivation then from really, truly feeling happier not smoking and liking the advantages of not smoking better (saving money, I don't smell, food tasted better, I can breathe better, I don't cough all the time...) 

I'm not feeling the same motivation now. Relapsers, what helped you get back to not smoking?

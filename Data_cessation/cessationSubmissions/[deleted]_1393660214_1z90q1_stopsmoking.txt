Tomorrow I wake up a non-smoker.

Smoked for ten years. Last July I quit smoking and made it until January; relapsed and now I've been smoking again for the last month and a half. I want to quit and stay quit forever. I have Alan Carr's book and I plan to leave it on my kitchen table. I also plan to put Post-it notes around my house and in my car reminding me that, in reality, I hate smoking and I don't want to do it anymore.

I am stronger than a craving! No more late-night trips to the convenience store! No more money burnt! I can do this. March 1, 2014: the day I stop smoking. Permanently.

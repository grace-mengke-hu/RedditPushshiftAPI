Collection of products

Currently reading Allen Carr's book. Decided it was time to round up and throw out all the tobacco/nicotine products I have stashed around my room. List includes, tin of dip, pack of rolling tobacco and papers, the remainder of a failed quitting attempt using nicotine gum, and an old empty pack (not sure why that one was there). 

Feels great to get rid of everything, cannot wait to be a non-smoker.

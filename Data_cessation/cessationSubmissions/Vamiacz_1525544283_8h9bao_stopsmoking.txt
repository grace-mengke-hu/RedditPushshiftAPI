Did i fuked it up?

Hey everyone, just found out about this subreddit and i wanna ask you guy for some tips i've been smoking over 4 years about an year ago i've tried to quit, i never managed to last over a week without cigarette but i heard about Allen Carrs book so i read it and i've changed my mindset and threw away my pack of cigs - lasted 3 weeks didnt had any urge to smoke thought it was over but i did met old friend (you know how this gonna go) "i lasted 3 weeks already one cig wont change  jack shiet" and now im smoking another 6 months and everytime i tried to quit again i wanted to smoke one so badly that i wasnt able to last over that 1 week checkpoint ever again. Anything i can do?

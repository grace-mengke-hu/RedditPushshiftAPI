First Day of the New Me

After dozens of half-assed quitting attempts i finally have decided to quit for good with the help of Allen Carr, and low Nicotine Ecigs (i just want to get away from smoke more than nicotine). My only hope is that this one lasts longer than the last ones did (not that it would take much)

Quitting with vaping

I've been half pack a day smoker for some 12 years and after many failed attempts to quit last year including nic patches and slowing down to 2 cigs in the evening, I've decided to give vaping a try.
And after I got my vape I didn't have a conventional cigarette nor any urge to smoke in more than 5 days. 
It works tremendously well for me. Vaping also feels so much better, there's a far greater throat hit and the taste is amazing with some liquids, not to mention the amount of vapor many devices can produce.
Basically it's more than substituted the cigs for me.
I'm using a 12mg liquid now and planning to gradually cut the nicotine dosage down to 0.

Also, if you are going to quit this way, make sure to buy a quality vape with decent vapor production not some shitty disposable e-cigs because the experience will vary significantly.

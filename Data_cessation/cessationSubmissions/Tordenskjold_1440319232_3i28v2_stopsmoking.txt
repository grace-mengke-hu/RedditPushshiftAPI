Wellbutrin and nicotine replacement?

Hey Quitters,

I smoked my last cigarette at 3 in the morning, it's now 10.30 and I feel the familiar panic set in. 

I've been prescribed wellbutrin and have been taking it as prescribed. Now I'm wondering if I should use patches/ecig or just 'tough it out'. I worry that using any nicotine will just reset the clock and I'll have to start over.

Any thoughts?

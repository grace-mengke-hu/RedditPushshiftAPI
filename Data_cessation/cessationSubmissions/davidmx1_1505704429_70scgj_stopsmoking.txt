What do you guys think about vaping?

Smoker for 7 years here.  Longest I've quit was 3 months going cold turkey. I was in a boxing class and the instructor kept telling us if you're a smoker you're not going to make it here, which was true. I remember I just kept telling myself to try and have the mentality of a non-smoker, and it worked. Anyways i stopped boxing because I was too caught up with engineering homework, classes got harder and more stressful, so I ended up smoking again. Fast-forward to my few vaping stints and It was all good for about 2 weeks but I just got sick of all the inconsistencies with vaping, I don't know if It's just me but the flavors muted out real quick from this vapors tongue deal, and i always ended up smoking again. So now I'm deciding to go cold turkey as of today. I'm just getting tired of always thinking about quitting. I need to convince myself again that I'm not a smoker and flip that switch in my brain back to how it was before I ever started smoking, when it was truly irrelevant.  You know the thing I missed the most from that time I didn't smoke there for a while was just being in the shower, breathing, and feeling clean inside and out.

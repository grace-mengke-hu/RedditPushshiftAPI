Does your dark gums becomes lighter after quitting smoke ?

Been smoking for past 6 years. 2 days back I quit smoking. Still under the process.

As a teenager I had pink gums and white teeth. After smoking for 6 years it has become dark and yellow. I went to dentist yesterday for cleaning. I asked him since I quit smoking will my gums become normal(pink & healthy) in coming days. He said no and also said my gums are fine.

Did any of you see a change in gum health and color after quitting?

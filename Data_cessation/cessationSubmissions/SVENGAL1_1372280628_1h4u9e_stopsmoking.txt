After 12 years of smoking and up to a pack a day, I'm on day 3.

Quit last Sunday at 7:00 pm.  My crutch are the e-cigs / nicotine vaporizers which are helping out tremendously.  Not sure if I could be doing this without them.  I can actually SMELL things! 


Any drawbacks from e-cigs that anyone has noticed?

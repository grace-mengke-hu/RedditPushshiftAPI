Quit Snus (upper lip tobacco)

Hi. 
Norwegian redditor here! In september I will move to England to study film production. I will not know anyone there and I am really excited about that. It's been my plan to move for 5 years and I've had this university as a goal for the last 3 years. I have never been more motivated to do anything.

Snus is a type of tobacco you put under your upper lip. I'm sure it is in some states in the US. I've been using snus for almost 5 years (I'm almost 20 now). All my high school friends and my girlfriend are using. If I don't get my snus I get really depressed, stressed out and I get the feeling I can't relax. I don't want to talk to anyone and I can't focus on anything. All I do is browse Youtube for 10 hours straight. Beer and snus goes hand in hand. I can't drink beer without snus. I mean it. After a meal I always, ALWAYS, take a snus. Even when I shower.

So.. I need some advice. Should I bring some cans of snus to UK as it is illegal to sell? So I can get through the freshers week without being a grumpy dude who don't want to talk to anyone. Or should I quit the day I leave. Have anyone else had this experience?

I know I won't be able to quit before I leave. I have too many temptations around me in my daily life.

Thanks Reddit! If anyone will be in Bournemouth the next couple of years, I'd love to hang out! I will probably be the depressed guy in the corner.

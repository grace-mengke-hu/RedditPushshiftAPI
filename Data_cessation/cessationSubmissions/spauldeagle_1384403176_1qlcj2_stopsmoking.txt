Just found this subreddit because I'm trying really hard to quit. Any motivational mantras or sayings that come to mind whenever you get that craving?

I can usually power through something if I have some sort of mantra or quick saying to repeat in my head whenever I feel doubtful. 

I've smoked for 3 years now, and smoked my first full pack in a day a couple weeks ago. Since then, I cannot go between classes without having a craving. I hate being that guy who smokes all the time, as most of my friends don't smoke. I want to quit before it really fucks me over. I've seen how shitty the past month has been because of my addiction, and could really use some help.

Even if it's cheesy, stupid, or weird, just the fact that you responded will help me quit. Thank you.

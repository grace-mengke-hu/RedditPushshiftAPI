I was told i have high blood pressure, When i smoke my fingers get cool.

I want to quit, i made it a point to set out all empty packs and count by 6 bucks a pack... I smoke a car payment. In a week.

I have to quit for health, for family, for no other reason than I know I need to.

I'm a 9 year smoker, and I work out side (im a land surveyor there is a lot of walking through the woods and mountains and i stand in one place. to cut it short. i smoke often out of just being bored.)

I smoke over a pack a day.

I work with smokers.

I am tired.

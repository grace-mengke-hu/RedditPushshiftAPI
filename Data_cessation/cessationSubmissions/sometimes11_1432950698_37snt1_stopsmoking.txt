any writers out there?

i sat down to start working on an article and was pounding out some preliminary thoughts and the craving just washed over me. i'm only 6 days in right now but frankly haven't had much of a desire for one. i'm concurrently quitting weed and the first few days were emotionally rocky but i've got through them. it's just this new concern of writing without smoking that's got me convinced i'll somehow lose my edge without the smoke. someone convince me otherwise.

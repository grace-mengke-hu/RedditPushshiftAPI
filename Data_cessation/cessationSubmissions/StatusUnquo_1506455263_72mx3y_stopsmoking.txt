SIX WEEKS

Today marks the sixth week I've had without using cigarettes.  I still have cravings (having one right now, in fact!) but I am determined.  Last time I made it seven weeks.  But that was because I had received some bad news, and then a friend said, "Don't start smoking because of this bad news!" and though it hadn't even crossed my mind beforehand, of course it was all I could think about after she said that.  I don't anticipate anything like that happening, this time.  Plus, that time I was under the delusion that I could just have a pack to get me through the stress and call it quits again.  Now I know better.

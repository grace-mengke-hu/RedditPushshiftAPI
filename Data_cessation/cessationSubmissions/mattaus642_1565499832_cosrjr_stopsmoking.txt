Tips on quitting cancer sticks

Ive been smoking cigarettes for over 6 years now. I am 22 and it disgusts me that I've picked up this habit. I've been struggling trying to quit cancer sticks for quite some time now, I've tried the patches and spray but when the time comes I doubt my self and am always on edge, just curious on how you guys quit and any tips would be appreciated

Clearing the Lungs of Post-Smoking Gunk?

Has anyone had success using any mucinex, inhalers, breathing exercises, etc. to expedite the process of opening up your lungs and kick-starting the healing? 

I'm taking Mucinex (OTC) right now to try to clear out some of the ex-smoker congestion, but I'd like to know what others have used.

6 Days in, I'm determined to stick with it this time

I've been smoking on and off for the past 14 years, since I was 15 years old. I grew up in a family of smokers, and one of my earliest memories is sitting in the car with my grandfather while he puffed away on his Benson and Hedges cigarettes while driving. I used to love the smell. I've quit a few times, the longest being 1 month about 3 years ago. To be honest, my main motivation to quit this time is the money- cigarettes are getting ridiculously expensive in Australia and I can't justify the cost any more. I'm also recently single (about 8 months) and I've found that smoking is a deal breaker for most guys. So far I've had headaches, an acne break out and about dreams where I've relapsed.

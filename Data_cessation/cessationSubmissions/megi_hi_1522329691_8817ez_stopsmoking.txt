thanks guys

i usually don’t post anything anywhere but this time I had to tell you all how grateful I am! Started smoking 10 years ago and when I realized it, I decided I have to quit. 10 fucking years, it was horrendous realization for me. I tried to quit few times before but never stuck with it. This time I can feel that it’s different and I believe in myself. Now it’s been a month since I quit and big part of it is because of you all. I’ve spent many hours reading all these reddit posts and it helped me so much. So thank you and good luck to all of you brave non smokers :)

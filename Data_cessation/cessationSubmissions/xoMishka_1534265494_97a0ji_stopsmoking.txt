Irritability Tips?

I quit smoking a week ago (smoked for 11 years), and I've noticed that I've had a really short fuse since then. I know that irritability is a side effect, but I have been honestly a raving bitch lately. It makes me feel bad because normally I'm a very kind, friendly, and empathetic person. I feel out of control of my emotions and find myself snapping at people a lot. Does anyone have any tips about controlling these negative side effects? Any little tricks that worked for you?

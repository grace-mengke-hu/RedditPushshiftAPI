19 days!!! I haven't gone this long without smoking in over four years

THANK YOU ALLEN CARR!! If you haven't read his book yet and you are trying to quit, I recommend it. It really changes your perspective on smoking and why it's so terrible. I have no desire to ever smoke again, and I know I won't. I went out drinking last night, and I was surrounded by smokers and I didn't even care. I feel like I can conquer anything now :')

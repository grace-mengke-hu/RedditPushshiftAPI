How to deal when everyone you hang out with smokes?

Hi, all. Today will be my first day of no smoking since I was 13 (I'm 21). I went through a bout of cancer a few years in that time, and numerous other health problems. I've decided its time to take my health into consideration rather than smoke away the anxieties and depression. However, I am currently at a summer job across the country where I live and work with my three good friends who smoke. What are some tips for getting through hanging out with people that smoke?

I've done it!

I feel like I'm over the hump! It's honestly been miserable. 

It started when I got a new car and decided not to smoke in it. That cut out a lot of smokes but more importantly gave me the final bit of confidence I needed. I started to have one before and after the car, and then just after, and now not at all.

I knew I could do it on day 4 when I was stressing out about a job interview, waiting out front of a casino with the smokers. I was thinking about smoking and only smoking and a lady even offered me one, but I said no thank you! I know I can do it now as I reminisce but still feel powerful. 

Each craving you beat, you get a little stronger. I managed to go several days a few years ago but caved after having "just one". Now I know to be done forever. 

I rarely post but always read. Thank you r/stopsmoking !!

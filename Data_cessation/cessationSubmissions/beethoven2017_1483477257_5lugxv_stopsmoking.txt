Failed miserably at quitting this year.. help?

O well folks, went from full determination to a shaky junkie in a matter of hours... then all I remember is that sweet nicotine easing the built up frustration in a matter of seconds. 

So this weekend I'm locking my self in until every last drop of nicotine leaves my system. Would appreciate any hacks/tips!! 

Edit: here we go again.Im so determined to quit and I made it 22 hours nicotine free. Wasn't easy but Im so proud. 

Then the real torture started.... Sweating, fever and that hot itchy tingly feeling in every single organ in my body. Came to conclusion that quitting cold turkey from a pack a day is plain torture! So I slipped and smoked 2 cigarettes. I was fully aware that I'm going to ruin my progress but I knew for a fact that sleeping was not an option in that state. So this will be my quitting journal. My next step is to reduce my nicotine intake before going cold turkey again. 

Thanks for the kind support and best of luck to whoever is trying to quit, nicotine is one messed up drug.

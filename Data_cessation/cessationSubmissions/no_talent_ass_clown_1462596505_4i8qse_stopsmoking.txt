Started "smoking" at 18, didn't realize I wasn't really smoking until I was 22 when I took my first real drag... and I was hooked.

Yeah, so the title pretty much says it all. For years I thought I was smoking but really I was just puffing and exhaling. I was always able to go days/weeks without a cigarette and it didn't seem to affect me the way it did other people. 

Then, one day, I actually drew the smoke deep into my lungs. Holy smokes, that was a revelation. Bam! I was hooked. I could no longer easily go without smoking. 

Over the years I've smoked on and off (more off than on, but it's been decades now). My most recent streak was 21 days in February. The streak before that (most of last year) was more than nine months. 

Today is day 3 - again - and I'm vaping 6mg moderately and it's getting me through the tough times (when I change flavors I'll drop it down to 3mg, or maybe zero). Haven't bought a pack in five days. Just gotta keep trying.

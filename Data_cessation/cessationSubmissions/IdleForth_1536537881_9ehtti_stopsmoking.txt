Quitting while recovering from bronchitis...Just hit two days.

I don't know if the recovery from bronchitis (i.e. being on anti-inflammatory steroids and expectorant pills) will help my quit efforts, but I'm definitely tired of feeling congested! Anyone else have this experience, and will my lung cilia heal faster because I'm also on medications? Or will I be in for more coughing even after the bronchitis is gone? Either way, I feel good that I've hit 48 hours.

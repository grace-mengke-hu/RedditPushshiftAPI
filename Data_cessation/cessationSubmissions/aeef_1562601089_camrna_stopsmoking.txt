It's been 40 hours and I need help

Smoked half a pack a day for seven years, which is quite a big portion of my life since I'm only 22.  Saturday night was my last cigarette. 

At the moment I'm feeling awful. I feel nauseous and dizzy, almost fell off a relatively high ladder today because I was so dizzy. My face is pale and people have asked me today if I was sick because they noticed too, so it's not just me. 
I feel like I'm falling ill but it's probably just my body screaming for nicotine, is that normal? How long until this passes? 

I hope this is going to pass, if not I'm afraid I won't make it that long. This is depressing, I thought quitting would make me feel liberated and strong but right now I'm just here trying not to cry.

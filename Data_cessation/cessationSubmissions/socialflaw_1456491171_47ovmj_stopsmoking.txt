Almost a week. Any advice?

Hello people. 6 and a half days since my last smoke, everything's going pretty smooth so far (the first two days were a bit rough, but I soldiered through). Mostly, my cravings happen when I have, like, five-ten minutes with nothing to do but wait (as in, arriving for work a bit sooner than when the shift starts,  waiting to pick up wife from her work, waiting for food to cook etc), which I used to fill up with a smoke or two. I used to smoke rolling tobacco, and it's the "having something to do with my hands" part that I miss as well as the cigarette itself. So, any suggestions or advice? How do you cope with these "empty spaces"?

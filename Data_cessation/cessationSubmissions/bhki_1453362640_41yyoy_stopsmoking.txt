102 cigarettes

I usually considered myself not as a heavy smoker. I used to smoke 3 to five cigarettes daily. I have been smoking for three years till Jan 1. At this new year I quit smoking for good and I have been smoke free for 20 days. Today I checked the progress in my quit smoking app and it showed I haven't smoked 102 cigarettes. The number was really frightening to me coz It never occurred to me that within twenty days I would have smoked 100 cigarettes. It's true that drops make an ocean. So if you guys think like the way I used to think please quit now. Every single cigarette counts.

New to sub, need advice please

I've been smoking since I was a young teen and I'm now almost 26. I've been wanting badly to quit and my s.o is really on me about it too. My sister bought me a great vape to try to transition so I've been doing a little of that, but it's so unsatisfying. I hate being a smoker. My clothes and everything always stink, I get bronchitis several times a year, and it gives me such low energy. I would really appreciate some tips or advice from a group who knows what they're talking about. What has worked well for you?


-also I have really severe anxiety and ptsd and that's a big factor in why i smoke over a pack a day And am afraid of giving it up.

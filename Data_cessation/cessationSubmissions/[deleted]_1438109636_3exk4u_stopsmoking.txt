I've quitted enough times to know that the cigarette I am craving right now is going to taste like shit.

And it's not going to be awesome and it's not going to calm me. So why the hell I am still craving it like that? I don't know if I have a badge, I quitted last Thursday. 

Worse thing is I quitted while my girlfriend was away, I am terrified I am going to jump on her because of my temper and go back to smoking again to calm myself down.

Trying to convince my SO to quit, I generally try not to nag him or make a big thing out of it but when it comes to PMS I can't control it... Advice anyone?

Disclaimer: was going to post this in /r/relationship_Advice but I don't want to disclose ages because it'll take the focus off the actual issue and I'd prefer to get advice from people with experience of quitting rather than people with no idea.

Been trying to get my SO to quit for months, generally I think I'm pretty supportive and try not to nag him too much about the subject because he HAS cut back significantly and is really trying to get in the right headspace to make the big jump.

BUT when I'm experiencing PMS I start feeling hurt, betrayed, angry, scared and usually have a bit of an emotional breakdown which I try to hide but generally fail at doing.

So, here's the PMS thought process (although, I'm pretty sure it's not all irrational PMS thinking):

* He tells me that he wants to give me everything but can't seem to give me what I want the most: for him to stop smoking so that I'll get to spend many more years with him before he inevitably dies before me (big age gap).
* (Similarly) The only way he's ever going to quit is if he smokes himself to death and that's going to ruin the rest of my fucking life.
* He tells me that I'm the most important thing in his world, yet he'd prefer to spend time having a cigarette than spend that time with me. That's right, I get fucking jealous of the cigarettes as if they're his mistress (although, to be honest I think really they're the wife, I'm the mistress)
* He tells me he'd do anything for me but he won't / can't quit smoking.
* I feel repulsed when I see him smoking, smell him smoking, smell the smoke on him and when I taste the smoke on his breath. I hate the feeling of being repulse by the man that I love so much.

So any advice on how I can better manage these emotions rather than trying to avoid him (as a way to stop myself bursting into tears and making him feel like shit)?

Edit: I totally acknowledge that this is my problem and not his, I'm just not sure how to address it within myself.

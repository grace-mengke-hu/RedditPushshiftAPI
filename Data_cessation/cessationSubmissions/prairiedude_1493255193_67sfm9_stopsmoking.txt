Should I bother trying right now?

Alright, so I smoked for like 10 years and mostly gave it up 5 years ago. With the exception of some parties where I bum a couple from friends. You know the story.

Now I got huge life changes underway. Divorce, relocation, job change, all that shit. I started buying regular a few months ago. Only about a pack or two a week, but I don't want it taking hold again. I got one of those apps and failed after a week. 

Should I try to cut it now, or just give in until in settled and start again. Anyone gone through this shit before with some advice? 

Thanks folks!

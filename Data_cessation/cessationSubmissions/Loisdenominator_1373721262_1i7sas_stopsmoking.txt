21 days ago I quit a 21 year habit

It feels surreal to type in 21 years...I always meant to quit earlier but kept putting it off. For about the first 10 years I only smoked socially. Then I started during the day, using it to deal with life's stresses, knowing that sooner or later I would quit. I'm not even sure how that turned in 21 years. 

It takes 21 days to form a habit and I'm 21 days into my non smoking habit. It feels great! 

For all of you who know you should quit but are trying to muster up the strength to do it, let go of your fear (easier said than done, but doable) and challenge yourself to 3 days without smokes. What's the worst that could happen? I can tell you that day 4 feels really liberating and full of hope. 

Read as much as you can about what can happen and what to expect when you quit, but also about all the benefits you stand to gain down the line. I used to say that smoking was the only irrational thing I did all the while litterally ignoring all the facts related to smoking. Informing myself really made it more and more of a no brainer. I am happy to report I am 99.9% rational now. 

Remember, the more you try to quit, the greater your chances of success. I think it has to do with having the intention to quit. Eventually you'll find the way and the time that works for you, but only if you keep trying. Eventually you'll get tired of trying and you'll just quit for good. 
 
Finally (I feel like I'm accepting an Academy Award) to all of you with a badge, you are my inspiration and make me feel like I am not alone in this struggle. Thank you for sharing and being a part of this community. 

Edited to add: bonus 21, I started at 21 years of age. I feel like I should go play blackjack or something

12 years

As new year's approaches, I know a lot of people are browsing here considering quitting. 

I dropped the habit 12 years ago. I don't crave cigarettes and haven't since about 6 months after quitting. I was a 1.5 pack a day smoker of American Spirit full flavors. 

It was hard, but you can do it. I'm not special, and no quitter is special, so just get it done.

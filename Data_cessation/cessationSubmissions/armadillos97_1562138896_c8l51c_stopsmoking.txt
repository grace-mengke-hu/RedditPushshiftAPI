I did a little research inspired by a post here.

Apparently, cigarettes contain polonium-210 and lead-210.

Polonium-210.

Lead.

Dopamine. It takes 3 months for the 15-20% dopamine drop to return to normal after quitting smoking.

My takeaway is that we have an increased risk of depression and relapse for 90 days. Knowing would help it, I think. All the links were collected on mobile, sorry. I don't think any of us want to be radioactive. 

Props to u/toloveaman for mentioning that video about how radioactive cigarettes are. I wish you all the best.

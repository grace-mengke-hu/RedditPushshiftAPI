Help - I'm about to start again...

I can just feel it. I'm about to finish an important project in work and tonight I really fancy a few beers and smokes. In my head I've decided that my current run of quitting is long enough and I can afford to restart and quit again in a couple of months. I have already checked out of being a non-smoker. I'm anticipating this evening like no other. Until today I was a really happy non-smoker. Tomorrow I'll be a happy smoker again. 

EDIT:
Thanks for all your replies. I still haven't done it yet. Yesterday I bought a pack of expensive Cuban cigars in duty free. They're still there unlit. But I'm telling myself if it's cigars I'll have an easier time not picking up cigs full time again. A few beers and a fat cigar... Can I handle it?

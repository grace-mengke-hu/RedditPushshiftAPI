Not doing very well

Trying to quit. Cold turkey isn't working. I've smoked every day since my quit date 3 days ago. I have managed to cut down a lot (only 3 a day now) but I'm finding it really hard not giving in by the end of the day. Any advice welcome. Did cutting down help anyone out there to stop altogether?

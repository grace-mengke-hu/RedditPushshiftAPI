My quit has been surprisingly easy. Well easier than I had thought it would be. Very little cravings. I used patches, 2 weeks on each dose and slowly weaned myself off nicotine. But I had a dream last night. Went outside with my boyfriend, he lights one, and I light one. Even in my dream I immediately freaked out and was like “Wait what am I doing, I quit!!” But I legit could taste that one puff in the dream and now I’m craving a cig soooo bad for the first time in weeks.

Smoking Redditors, When did you realize it was a big problem?

I'd really like to know who has started experiencing health problems after years of smoking.  Specific details would be great and what did you do?




& My story, if you're interested...:

I have been a smoker for almost 7 years at about a pack a day. It wasn't until I had a second upper respiratory infection that I really considered the number.  I've had asthma in the past, but it hasn't been very severe since I was younger.  I'm relatively fit.  I bike a lot, but I also drink quite a bit too.  For the past few years, I had reduced my smoking to only when I drank.  The problem was when I drink a lot (which is often I admit), I smoke at least a pack in one night after not smoking at all for however long. Eventually I got pretty serious, but even so, when I've had a few too many and I'm around my old smoking buddies especially, I will still have a few.  But when I do, my throat is murderously sore the next morning!  I cough up tons of phlegm.  I feel a horrible scratching.  This is very anxiety-inducing on those days... but when the next party night comes around I tend to somehow forget it.  Has anyone had similar experiences, and how far is too far with smoking-induced health questions?

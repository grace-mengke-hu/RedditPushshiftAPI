6 Days... Wednesdays are my trigger day.

Every Wednesday I enter a table tennis tournament at a bar, and the guys I play with there all smoke. It's been a reasonably easy 6 days, but hanging out with those guys on Wednesdays turns the difficulty up a little bit. If I can hold out tomorrow then holding out until next Wednesday should be that much easier.

Need some support and advice for quitting.

I began my stop smoking phase around December, and have been off and on it since then. I'm to the point now where I smoke while drinking, and I want to hear some advice about a couple of things in regards to that. 

1) I definitely want to kick the habit completely. Do any of you have any strategies while drinking that you use? 

2) At this point, the day after I smoke my shoulder hurts. It is definitely helping me realize how terrible the habit is, and I've reduced smoking while drinking because of it. But it does worry me. Has anyone else experienced something like this? 

I don't really have familial support since they never knew that I smoked before. Does the quit app help? Are there any other resources that might be useful? Thanks guys!

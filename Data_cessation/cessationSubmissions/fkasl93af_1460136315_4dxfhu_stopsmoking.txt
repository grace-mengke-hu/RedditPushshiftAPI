14 days today

As of 6:00 pm today, I will have not smoked for 2 solid weeks.  It's been a roller coaster of emotions.  Most of the time, I'm actually ok, but there have been 3 days that were so terrible, I was crying in public as a response to (mostly work-related) stress.  Reading this sub daily has helped immensely, even on the easy days.

Today, I had a success at work and immediately thought about calling up my smoker friend to go celebrate with a cigarette, but just as immediately thought to myself that that isn't an option anymore, drank some water and came to this subreddit.

I'm doing really well, so happy to not be a smoker anymore :D

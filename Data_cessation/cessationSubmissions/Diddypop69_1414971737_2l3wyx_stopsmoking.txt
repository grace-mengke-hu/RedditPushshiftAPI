100 days

Hi Reddit,

I've never posted but since I've just completed 100 days without smoking I figured I'd post to thank the numerous stories and journeys I've read over the last 100 days. 
I quit cold turkey and I honestly believe I was successful in part to spending time reading posts to distract myself from the craving. Website says distract yourself by going for a walk when feeling an urge to smoke etc. this is not always an option, imagine going for a random midnight stroll to overcome an craving? The modern day urge distraction tactic is a smart phone.
Anyway I don't know what to write, I don't even know why I suddenly decided to post but for anyone reading who has just started the journey, you can do it and riding out a craving reading stories on quit sites is simply working wonders for me!

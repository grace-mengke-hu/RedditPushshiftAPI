5 days now but I can't breathe..

last thursday I smoked my last sig. Everything went well untill yesterday, I had sudden chest pains and felt out of breath after climbing a set of stairs. Today I felt better and I went running (5km) I'm supposed to be a good athlete but today i practically died. just now I tried to do some simple push ups but coulnd't get to 20.

My physical condition seems to be destroyed since I stopped smoking...Does annyone else have any experience with this?

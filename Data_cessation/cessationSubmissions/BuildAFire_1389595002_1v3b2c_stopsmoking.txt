Tomorrow's the day.

I will smoke my last cigarette tonight before I go to sleep. I will remove lighters, and ashtrays before bed, as well. After my morning shower, I will slap on an expired nicotine patch that I pray hasn't lost it's potency. (I'm kind of poor right now.) 

Any good tips or well wishes would be great! 

Wish me luck, and strong will!

Been smoking for 4 years(1 pack of cigarettes a day) need some help on stopping! :(

Im only 20 years old and i wanna stop because recently im always hyperventilating. Went to the hospital twice and they just said im way too anxious. Never had this problem before. Now i only smoke like 1-5 sticks a day. Should i stop cold turkey or cut down smoking sigh. Any help would be appreciated hehe :)

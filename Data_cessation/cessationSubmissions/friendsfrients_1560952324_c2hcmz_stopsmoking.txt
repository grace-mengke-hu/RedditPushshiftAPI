Half way through day 3, so emotional!

I'm doing surprisingly well craving wise, but I'm just so sad. Weepy, feeling alone. I'm sure this is part of the nicotine withdrawal. 

I am proud of myself and in tears at the same time! Craziness! 

I'll try to get out later. Getting outside might help. 

I doing cold turkey, nicotine replacements weren't working well for me. I needed a clean break.

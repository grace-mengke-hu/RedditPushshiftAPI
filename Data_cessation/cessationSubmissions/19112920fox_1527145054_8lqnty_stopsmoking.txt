Is anyone else just bored, all the time?

I'm coming up on two months completely nic free after twelve years smoking. I suppose I feel better. 
It's nice being able to finish a run without wheezing, and not (poorly) hiding a bad habit from dates, but man, I miss the activity of smoking.

I'm surrounded by smokers at work and outside of work. I always go out with people to smoke because I find I'm bored if I stay inside alone, but I just end up feeling like I'm not part of the group when I'm not having a smoke.
That seems silly, some of these people are my closest friends.
Overall I just constantly feel like I should be doing something.
I don't have a very good support group (everyone is proud of me, but I'm quitting alone) so I don't have anyone to vent to who would understand.

Ha, can someone please validate this feeling?

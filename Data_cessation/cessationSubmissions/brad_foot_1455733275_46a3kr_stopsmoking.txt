Day 5 and I really want a cigarette

I had my first cigarette in college and have pretty much smoked half a pack a day for the last 12 years; this is my first honest attempt at quitting cold turkey. The past four days have been great so I thought quitting would be a breeze, but today I just feel physically awful (sore throat, fatigue, neck aches - to the point of I will probably leave work early because I am sick) and have never wanted a cigarette so badly in my life. Would anyone recommend patches or lozenges? I've tried Nicorette gum in the past, but it just turned into an alternate source of nicotine that didn't really do anything for my cigarette cravings. Should I just try to ride it out? I had read that the physical effects of nicotine addiction goes away after a couple of days, so I am feeling pretty bummed right now.

Six months!

Made it to six months cigarette free on the 19th. I also stepped down from 4mg lozenges to 2mg without much trouble. I do notice some cravings but am able to make it out with some cognitive restructuring and a lozenge. I've been in smoky cars, houses and even a local bar where you can smoke inside without needing to pick up a cig. Feels good, and I'm looking forward to 1 year smoke free. I'll be still trying to keep an eye on myself long-term though, as I've previously relapsed after over 1 year. Any tips for long term maintenance are much appreciated!

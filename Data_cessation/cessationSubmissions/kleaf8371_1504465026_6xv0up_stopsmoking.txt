I don't want to quit - help!!

I smoked for 4 years in college, about a pack a day, and then quit for two or so years afterwards. Back in April I had a few cigarettes, and then (as it does) the ball started rolling and now I'm up to a pack every few days.

It's disgusting, I smell, it's expensive, I have to shower sometimes twice a day just to feel clean, and recently I've started smelling nicotine in my sweat, even after a shower! How gross is that???

But, alas, I don't actually want to quit. I mean every few weeks I get disgusted with myself, dump some water in my pack, and don't smoke for a couple days or a week. But then I have a stressful day at work, or a fight with my SO, and immediately go and buy a pack. 

I need advice from you guys - I'm sure I'm not the first person to have this problem, and I know relying on smoking doesn't actually alleviate my stress and it's just the addiction talking, but I just can't stay motivated. 

What are some good ways to get past that first really stressful day after you've quit? I've tried the 'I'll buy a pack tomorrow', but somehow always talk myself out of it. I've also tried eating myself through cravings, but I'm afraid I'll gain weight (trying to maintain here). Thanks for any advice you guys have!!!

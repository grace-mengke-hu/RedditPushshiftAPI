I'm a liar

I deleted my badge a few weeks ago because I was lying to myself and everyone else. I started smoking again and I feel horrible about it. Tomorrow will be my 27th birthday; that would mean 12 years as a smoker. I can't believe it's gone this far, from the first time smoking a cigarette outside of my high school to 12 years later in the blink of an eye. I want to quit but it's so difficult when you're drunk to say no. I've read Allen Carr's book, I've tried gum, lozenges and cold turkey...I just don't know what to do anymore. If you guys have any tips or advice, I'd love to hear it. Thanks

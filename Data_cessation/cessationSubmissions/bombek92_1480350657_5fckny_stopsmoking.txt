your faith needed!

Tomorrow 'll be 6 weeks.

Recently I started working on my degree-thesis and I feel so bored, I start to think about bad things e.g. to go to smoke. I know how it's gonna end - it's not one cigg but it's gonna be full-smoking again. 

Even tough I know all the consequences I am about to start this shit again... urghhhhh

Got a well-paid job, everything is OK. It's just this f****ing thesis which drives me crazy. 


Just wanted to share with someone this little things.

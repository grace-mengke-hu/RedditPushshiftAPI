3 days in

Im 3 days in. Threw a pack away this morning as they seemed to be calling my name. After almost 2 years of not even being able to enjoy a cigarette due to radical nephrectomy &amp; finding out the tumor they removed was Renal cell carcinoma I have been able to stop. I just hope that I am able to stay quit. My mouth waters when I think of it, even knowing that I am putting myself at such high risk.

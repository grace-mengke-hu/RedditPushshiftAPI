Those who succeeded after numerous tries..

Hi everyone, i have quit several times now and started back again after few months or weeks recently. I just can't help myself whenever i see my brothers smoking and i just feel left out but i always feel a piece of shit afterwards having no self control.
I just wanted to know how those of you finally quit after failing to quit several times before.
At this point i feel that i might never be able to quit it for good and that even if i quit i'l pick it up after few weeks or months :(

I just ducking relapsed!!?

Okay so I haven't smoked a cigarette since yesterday at like 6:00pm. Well like an hour ago I really wanted a cig so I found a bunch of change in my car, drove 2 miles to the gas station on snow covered and icy roads, pulled into the gas station and almost got stuck just so I can buy a pack of cigs. I'm so fucking pissed off at myself and depressed. Wtf should I do?

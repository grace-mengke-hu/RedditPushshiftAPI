Day 6. Started getting the most intense nicotine cravings.

Which is weird, because the first 3 days (and especially day 3) are supposed to be the worst, but I didn't get much cravings the first 5 days and when I did they were really mild. Today however (which is day 6) when I woke up I got the strongest nicotine craving of my life, and it lasted for a good 30 minutes or so. During the day this happened to me like 5 times. If I had a cigarette in my vicinity I don't think I could have stopped myself from caving in. Hell, if I wasn't as lazy as I am I'd probably have gone off to buy a pack. Not sure how I'm supposed to fight these cravings in the future if they happen when I'm already outside and buying a pack is easy.

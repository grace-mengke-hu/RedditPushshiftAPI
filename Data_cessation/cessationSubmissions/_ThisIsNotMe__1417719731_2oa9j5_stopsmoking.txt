Have anyone noticed the extra hour you have each day?

I'd never thought about this before, but let's make some simple math here. I used to smoke 20 cigarettes a day, a pretty common number actually. Each cigarette represents at least a 5min smoke break (I will go with 5 min, but I know I am being a little conservative here as some smoke breaks can take easily 10 min, or even more if you count some time to wash your hands and thinks like that). So, if we spend 5min x 20cigarettes a day, we are spending up to 1h:40m smoking each day! WOW I thought about a lot of reasons to stop smoking, but gaining almost 2 hours a day was not in my plans, and this is amazing! I began to write a journal, read 30 min a day and doing 20min naps before lunch! AND I AM NOT TIRED WILLE DOING IT! 

Keep strong fellow quitters!

Fighting cravings

I am finding it a constant thing in my mind like a nagging thought everyday, I haven't smoked in almost a month but I think about backsliding everyday. Its even harder when I am around others that are smoking, its weird how I go from cigarette smoke smells bad when I was smoking to now its almost like the best smell ever... I guess I just needed to get this off my chest and ask if anyone has any tips on how to get past this?

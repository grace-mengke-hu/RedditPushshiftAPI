Question about patches

If I have already smoked this morning do I have to wait until tomorrow to use a patch? I'm feeling grossed out by my smoking and motivated to go to the store and buy a box of patches. All of the information I read on them though says put one on fresh the morning of your quit day. Thanks for the help.

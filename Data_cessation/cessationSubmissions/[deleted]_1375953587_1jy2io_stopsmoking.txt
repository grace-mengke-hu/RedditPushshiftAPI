21 and ive smoked regularly for 4 years and need help

i grew up with my step-dad who smoked and eventually my mom started. i had my first cigarette when i was twelve then didnt have one again until  i was 16. when i got to college i started smoking a pack a week, gradually smoking more and more. now i smoke a pack every 2 or three days. i havent tried anything besides quitting cold turkey and it never lasted more than a month. whats the best way to quit before i start going into a pack a day or worse. once i quit (fingures crossed) how do i keep it that way? I smoke a lot when i drink or visit my mom. ive been reluctant to try the nicorette gum because of how much it costs.

Quickly losing hope...

Hello, thanks for reading. I've been a half a pack smoker for years now,. I quit for a month a while back after reading Easyway which was a huge success for me, but after relapsing I fell right back into smoking the same amount. Ever since then every attempt to quit has lasted maybe a few days at most, during which time I'm miserable and no fun to be around. I lost my last copy of the book after lending it to a friend so I purchased another one recently and want to read it again, but I'm worried that it won't have the same effect on me now. What should I do? Halp.

Question for you all regarding smoking co-workers

Hi...I work in a fairly small office. Up until 12 days ago, there were just two of us who smoked. We are a relax and very casual environment and can come and go as we please as long as the work is done. My co-worker and I would go outside together to smoke whenever the urge hit one of us....off we go!

She and I are not friends outside of work...not socially. But as smokers, there is (was) a bond between us. I'm sure most of you can relate to that. When I quit 12 days ago (GO ME!), that bond was broken. And now my co-worker won't even look my way, barely says a word to me and is obviously avoiding me to the point that other co-workers are noticing. (At first I thought it was just me being overly sensitive)

And no I did not make a big deal out of quitting. In fact, very few even knew. I purposely didn't want to make a fuss over it.  Not my style. 

Luckily our jobs rarely overlap, so we are not dependent on one another to get our jobs done. So interaction is not necessary. But man o man you can cut the tension with a knife. I have made sure that I am pleasant. I have not had any conversations with her regarding my quit other than the initial one just stating that I had quit. I didn't want to be 'that gal' who forces her quit on anyone who will listen. 

Any thoughts? Any advice? I considered just chatting with her about it but I walk into a room and she walks out...especially if someone asks me about it. (I am trying to not talk about it for this reason!) I feel bad but I can't give up on a goal just because someone doesn't like it. I'm just not sure what to think.

AND by the way, I'm 50 and she is about 58. So we are not young (not old either) and have been around the block...a couple of times!

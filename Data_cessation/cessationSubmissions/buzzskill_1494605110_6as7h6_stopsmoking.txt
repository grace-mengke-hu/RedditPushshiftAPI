Something unexpected today

It is Friday morning.  I got up for work, got ready. Went through my normal routine. Then I stepped outside to take the short walk to my car.  I took a deep breath in through my nose, the smell brought me back to when I was just a kid.  The thick fragrances of spring hung heavy in the air.  I realized that I hadn't smelled anything so sweet and wonderful for 30 years. 30 years of smoking had nearly taken away all of my ability to smell. It has been 20 days since I quit. I realized then, that this is probably only one of the things I've been missing out on for all these years. I also realized that I hadn't even thought about smoking while getting ready for work this morning. This was a first since my quit date. 
For anyone on the fence about quitting. Do it now so you can enjoy the fresh spring and summer air.

Not sure if I am havig nicotine withdrawals or not.

Hey guys,

A little background to start off, I have been a mild nicotine user since my senior year of highschool (4 years ago) I started with chew, then moved to vaping, then actual cigarettes. As ass backwards as that sounds, I currently and for the past year have only been using my Juul and smoking what we call “Mokes”(half tobacco/half weed) out of my bong. A week ago today, I lost my Juul while on a bar crawl. All seemed fine and I have stuck with my bong and not really felt a need for the Juul. Lost it on sunday, carried on as I just stated, but friday night, I began to feel light headed, I went out with my girlfriend and her father for dinner and could not eat much. The next day, I was very weak and nauseous and ended up staying in bed all day. I went to get a smoothie but that is all I have had for over 24 hours.  I would get the chills, get hot, fall asleep, and felt down right miserable. Came home that night (last night) and smoked a moke, I felt a little better but then just went to sleep and woke up a little warm but not too bad. This morning now, I am still lacking appetite but just smoked again. Any recommendations or observations that could help me with feeling like this?

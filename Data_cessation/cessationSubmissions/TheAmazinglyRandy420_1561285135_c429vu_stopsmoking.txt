After 10 years smoking like a chimney I'm quitting cold turkey!

I have only 1 cigarette remaining for after breakfast and from this point onward I will succeed stopping this nasty habit due to shear will. This is the day 

I THEAMAZINGLTRANDY420, HEREBY VOW FROM THENCE DAY FORWARD I WILL NEVER SMOKE ANOTHER CIGARETTE FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

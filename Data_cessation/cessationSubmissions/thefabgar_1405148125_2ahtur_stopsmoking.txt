Hi guys. First post here.

Hello guys, I've been in this sub for a long time. But I think this is my first post.

28yo male, smoking since my 21. A pack a day, somedays one and a half.

I just want to say to you that YOU are my inspiration.

My last cigarette was 9 days ago. I've done on purpose a lot of things that trigger my desire to smoke. Just because I want to do some things faster. I drink wine and beer every weekend. I watch a lot of movies at home. And in fact, I'm proud to still have a full pack of 20 on my desk right now. This is self control and i think I need it. It makes me stronger. I prefer this way than just waiting for a situation or something to trigger my desire.

The only problem is, now on my 9th day, the cravings are extremely long. I die for a smoke right now. I want to smoke RIGHT NOW. 

While I wont ( and I'm telling you this with the pack on my hand, just to prove myself my self control) It just bothers me a lot...the first three days were really hard, but I didn't imagine that the 9th day would be one for the most difficult to me.

Is this normal? Is this a 10 or 15 days rule just like the 72hs rule?

Thanks in advance and I'm proud of myself. Thanks to you guys.

Help

I know this has probably been posted a million times but never mind. 

I really want to quit smoking. I've smoked for about 10 years now and I feel my body is at it's most unhealthy at the minute (A lot of factors, not just smoking). I've only just quit drinking alcohol (13 days with out a beer, I'm no alcoholic, but I drank way to much). My question is, how the actual fuck do I bust the want for a cigarette? Just thinking about not having one is enough to drive me insane! 

I really don't want to use patches or any kinda of aid if I'm honest. I think it's really counter intuitive. 

Any advice is welcome. 

Thanks in advance.

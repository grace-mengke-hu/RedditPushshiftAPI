Happy 4th of July Everyone!

I quit a year ago today. I had been a long time lurker here before that and it was because of all the awesome and inspiring posts here that I finally sacked up and kicked a pack a day habit of almost ten years. I made a promise that if I made it to a year I would finally post. Thank you so much to all of you, you're awesome. Over 12 months I've lost 10kg (22lb?) and completely changed myself. Today I cycled to work, went to the gym for over an hour and cycled home. I do that most days of the week. I wouldn't have dreamed of being able to do that whilst I was still puffing away. 

So, as uncomfortable as this is for a Brit to say, Happy Independence Day everyone. Today will always have a special significance for me and I just wanted to share.

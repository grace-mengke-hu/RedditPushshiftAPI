I found out I was pregnant and haven't even had a drag since. The final kick I needed.

I have been trying to quit for ages, but always failed because I wanted to smoke, but now with my (surprising but wonderful) news I have the final push I needed. 

I found out a few weeks ago and quit. I have cravings, but I am doing this for my child. I plan on this being the end for good, no more smoking after the baby is born. Nothing. For good. 

I finally have the balls to quit.

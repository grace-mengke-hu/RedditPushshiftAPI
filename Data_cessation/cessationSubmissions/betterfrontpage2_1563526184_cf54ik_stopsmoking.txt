Longtime lurker; first time poster!

Been a smoker for last 20 years and an alcoholic for the last 11.

I completely quit alcohol (a big smoking trigger for me) six months ago in January and have been looking forward to kicking smoking as well. I beat -OH and I know I will be able to beat these poison sticks as well. I hope to be free of all addictions before I turn 40 next year.

I have been lurking around for 2-3 months picking up bits of encouragement here and there and getting inspired by all your stories of success, perseverance and lapses. Thanks to all for sharing - you rock!

I hope to have smoked my last cigarette today ðŸ¤ž

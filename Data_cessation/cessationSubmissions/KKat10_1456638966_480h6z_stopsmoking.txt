Made it through my first week!

My quit date was Feb 21st. I have a "quit smoking" app on my phone and it suggested I come on this site! I've been reading everyone's stuff and it's so nice to know I'm not alone in this. I have switched to an e-cig for now until I start getting more of a handle on cravings - taking the nicotine down a notch every week. I've smoked for 30 years, so cold turkey ain't happenin'! Anyway, reading your advice and stories is very encouraging - glad I'm here. :)

Smoke free for 1 month and 24 days but I've replaced it with eating. Help!

I am 28 years old. After being a smoker for nearly half my life, I finally feel like I have a good foothold on this addiction. I'm almost two months in and hardly ever have urges. I can even have a drink with my smoker friends - a huge trigger for me early on. 

Now, at this point I've realized that I've replaced a 3/4 pack a day habit with stress eating. I snack all day and really go hard during meals. I've never had a weight problem my entire life but just in the time since i quit, I can already notice my weight gain visually. (Around 10 pounds). I don't want to trade addictions and I've already heard "it's better than smoking" but I'm trouble by the message. 

Has anyone else experienced this??? 

Thanks for the supportive community.

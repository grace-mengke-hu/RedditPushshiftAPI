19 days no smoking :))

Never thought i could consider myself a non smoker but.... I am :)) I quit because I had bronchitis really bad and I couldnt breath.. I thought wow if this is how it will feel down the road from smoking I dont want that . People always say they have trouble breathing . You dont pay attention until you physically cant . I did it . 19 DAYS AGO I REGAINED MY LIFE AND UNDID THE CHAIN I HAD FOR 7 YEARS.... so can u !

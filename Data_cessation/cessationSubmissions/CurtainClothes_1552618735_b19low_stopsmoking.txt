6 months smoke free; still struggling and wanting to know if this is normal

6 months ago my partner and I quit smoking cold turkey (if I could make that choice again, I'd absolutely choose some form of nicotine replacement therapy--it was really hard!) 

We've had a tumultuous time since August 2018, and things have only recently settled down. Even account for that though, our mental health has been *awful* and I wonder if anyone else has experienced this? 

We expected initial withdrawal symptoms, and weathered them pretty well I'd say, but now six months later and we are both still struggling with stress and anger issues, and even just a general...bafflement sometimes, like quitting smoking shook up the snow globes of our minds. Memories feel different than they did, or we remember them differently, and sometimes we both struggle to empathize with others or feel positive emotions. 

I recognize that some of this may just be unaddressed mental health issues that we were using smoking to cope with, but has anyone else felt like they're an entirely different person after quitting, and not necessarily in a good way? 

We're stoked we quit and know that future-us will thank us for this sacrifice, but it seems unexpectedly hard, and lonely not knowing anyone else whose experienced this.

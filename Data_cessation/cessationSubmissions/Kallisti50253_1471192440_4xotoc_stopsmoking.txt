I've failed, hard.

I've been smoking again, justifying it as only on the weekends and only socially, but it's still been happening. Thus far I've been able to ignore the cravings during the week though, so at least that's a step in the right direction? 

I guess I'm beginning again, starting now. 5th time's the charm?

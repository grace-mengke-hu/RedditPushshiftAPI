Finally after 6 years...

I started smoking right as I turned 18 as that is pretty much when I started actually making friends that happened to be smokers and I didnt really care about my health or even my well being during that time of my life. Now im my mid 20s I have turned my life around quite a bit and happened to start eating better and exercising. 

But even with all that it took me a year of telling myself to stop buying packs before I put them down for good with me now going on 3 months clean and starting my old passion of jiu-jitsu that really requires cardio and endurance.

My coach quit smoking 6 years before me and he told me that early on that you just have to keep quitting smoking over and over and over again until it sticks. Which is exactly what I did, kept telling myself    I was done wasting money on cancer.

I feel amazingly better after only 3 months, I still have small urges every few weeks but they are dwindling. 

I wish all of you the best regards if you are struggling like I was. Please remember that you are worth more than wasting your money and time on smoking. It is going to be difficult be you can face that adversity.

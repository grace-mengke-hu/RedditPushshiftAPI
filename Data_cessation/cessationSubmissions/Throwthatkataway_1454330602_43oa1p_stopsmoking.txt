Day one, part two: I have the best bf!

Day one was much easier to handle than I thought it would be, mainly because of my super amazing supportive boyfriend! He's a smoker with no immediate plans to quit, but before I quit he promised he'd be supportive. And he was! He came over around dinner time, changed into fresh clothes that hadn't been smoked in,  washed up and gargled with mouthwash, and spent the whole night playing scrabble with me, watching Jessica Jones, and eating candy. He didn't smoke at all, all night, in solidarity with me! I told him he didn't have to do that and he replied that he won't always, but that in the first couple weeks he was happy to support me this way and that after all I've done for him it was no hardship. 

I think I'm gonna have to put a ring on it! :) :) :)

Here's to a smooth and speedy day 2!

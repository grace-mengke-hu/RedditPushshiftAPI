A month smoke free, got my star, what happens next?

Find the reasons to keep going, the original ones + new ones... Peace of mind (that's the most important one), long life with my loved ones, feel that I'm close to do one of the biggest challenges and important decisions of my life, money... But when I look at people smoking I sometimes envy them. This will happen forever? Keep going guys we can do it! 💪💪☺️☺️

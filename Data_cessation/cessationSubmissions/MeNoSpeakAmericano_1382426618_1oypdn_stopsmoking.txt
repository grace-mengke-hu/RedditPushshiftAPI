I can do it... Nope, I can't - I can do it... Shit is too hard

The fuck is wrong with me, I quitted smoking for three month then got back to it, then I am heavily smoking it more than before


For the past 3 days I have been trying, my peak was 35 hours smoke free but man wasn't that hard to smoke after that 

I almost was in tears while smoking it, fucking shit. It this cigg stronger than me 


Wish me luck, haven't smoked for 8 hours now
hope to get back to you with at least a consistent year off

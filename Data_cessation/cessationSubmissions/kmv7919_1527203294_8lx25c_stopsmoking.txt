Question?? Has this happen to you too?

I’m 1 month today. I still think about smoking multiple times a day, and I can’t wait for the day it doesn’t cross my mind. Cravings are getting easier though and they don’t last long.  People have noticed something I’ve been doing and even I’ve noticed it a few times after the fact. So, I’m wondering did this happen to any of you. 

I tend to take deep breaths either through my nose or mouth. Then I exhale through my mouth. It’s loud enough that it’s noticed and people have asked me if something is wrong.  My sister told me that she noticed me doing this at least 15 times one day at work. 

Has anyone had this type of breathing patterns after you had recently quit?  I’m curious if it’s my subconscious way of smoking.

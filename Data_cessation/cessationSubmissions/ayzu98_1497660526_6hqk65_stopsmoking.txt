Can't quit smoking no matter how hard I try.

I am 19 and have been smoking for 2 years. I am extremely addicted to cigarettes, to the point where it's unbearable to go through the day without having one every few hours. I am currently under a lot of stress, as I have suffered from mental illness for several years now. I've tried using a vape, but no matter how much I use it, it just doesn't satisfy me at all. Once I get a craving, it will NOT go away until I finally give in and smoke. When I crave a cigarette, it ends up being the only thing I can think about and I completely obsess over it. It drives me absolutely insane. I've tried the gum, lozenges, and the patch. The only thing that ever worked was chantix, but I think that's what caused a suicidal episode. I really need to stop because I already have enough health problems. I feel so hopeless and I don't know what else to do at this point

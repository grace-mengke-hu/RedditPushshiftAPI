Understanding what Alan Carr says in his book

I've been smoking daily since July of 2014, averaging about 6-8 cigarettes a day, in addition to being a heavy user of weed. In that time I've gone for more than a week without cigarettes only twice, both occasions being when I was on family vacations and couldn't smoke with my parents around (they don't approve and I would get in a lot of trouble).

Why do (did?) I smoke? Because I was lonely. And when there's nobody to witness your life apart from yourself, cigarettes act as punctuation marks. The commas and semicolons mark beginning or the end of something, the pauses in between. That's the thing about cigarettes. They can be anything you want them to be. The beginning of a day or a project, the candles of celebration, the markers of bad times, a breather (ironic, I know) in a hectic day. You'll light one when you're working, stressed, relieved, worried or happy. You'll light one just because you can.

I read Alan Carr's book in March this year, and even though I agreed with most of what he said and had been thinking about quitting since the beginning of the year, it took me two months more (out of which one was smoke free, with two single cigarette relapses) to make sense of it. He mentions that smokers are people who don't like being happy. The problem is that you have to get smoking out of your system to realise that. After successfully navigating past the cravings, the reaction of your body to not having nicotine in your system and the little games played by the nicotine monster, the only thing you feel is a huge weight being lifted from your shoulders. In the first time in nearly five years, I feel light and giddy, like I've stepped into sunlight after a long, long time of constant rain. And even though there is still a lot in my life that needs to be fixed, I honestly feel a twinge of hope. I'm nowhere near being content or happy, but I'm no longer the guy smoking because I'm angry at the world.

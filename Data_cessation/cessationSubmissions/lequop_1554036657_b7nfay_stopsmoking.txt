Thyroid function changes after quitting?

I quit about three months ago and am no longer on NRT. I gained 10-15 lbs within the first month of quitting and also had the standard insomnia, anxiety, depression, etc. Since going off NRT though, I've been extremely lethargic (slept most of the weekend).

I read a bit on Google and it looks like nicotine can serve to reduce symptoms of hypothyroidism or potentially cause temporary hypothyroidism in people who quit. I'm going to make an appointment with a doctor, but was hoping to hear from people who may have experienced this (including whether you needed meds or whether it was only temporary).

Note: I did have hypo symptoms early in a pregnancy but that also went away without treatment (doctors monitored it instead).

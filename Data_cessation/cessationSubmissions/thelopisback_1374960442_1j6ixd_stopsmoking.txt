Day 2

This kinda sucks. I'm not a fan of this feeling. I feel as if i'm betraying a friend or losing a loved one. I'm struggling to keep my eyes open i'm so tired. 
But the only thing that keeps me going is realizing anything that makes me feel this bad must be tearing up my insides.
Weird rant I'm sorry.
Any advice would be helpful.

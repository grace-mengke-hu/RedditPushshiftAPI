I have a weight gain question.

Hello there. Smoke free for a month and 16 days. Definitely have been feeling chunkier for the past week or so. 

I have not altered my activity or dietary intake since quitting, so I imagine this change is directly related to my metabolism altering and having a more regular appetite. My question is: Is this a temporary experience, or should I pay much more attention to my diet and activity since the smoking element has been removed? Any personal experience or advice is welcome. Thanks!

4 Days in - The habitual struggle

Hi everyone,

I used to smoke about a pack a day over the last couple years due to stress habits and often times boredom.

I decided to quit cold turkey 3 days, 19 hours, the first couple days felt like a struggle chemically, I spent a lot of time at the gym and in the sauna and drinking water, that seemed to help a lot.

Its now the habit I am trying to break. What do you guys do to keep yourself busy when you get stressed out or anxious?

I look forward to hearing from you all!!

Help prevent my mom from smoking again

My mom quit more then a year ago, but she's steadily gained weight since then. (None of us notice any difference, but she says feels fat now.) 

She's tried cutting back on eating, going to the gym consistently with her friend, and often goes on a walk with the family dog. 

Today she just dropped a bomb on us that she'll return to smoking come monday since it cut her weight down before. The only dietary habit I've noticed that might be bad is she drinks a cup of coca cola each day. (I don't want to cut that out since it'll just depress her some more - so a workaround would be better.)

I don't know much about fitness, or how smoking affects weight loss/gain. What plan should I suggest to her?

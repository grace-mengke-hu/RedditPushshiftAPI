Gonna be a tough weekend

So I have been doing well no slip ups or anything.  Had some weird dreams and today some pretty strong urges which have made me put off getting gas.  Im most worried about this weekend though as I work 3rd shift and smoking is a part of my schedule.  The voices in my head make this stupid arguments that although dumb sound so good.  Like hey just smoke this weekend and quit again Tuesday morning (my weekend ends Tues morn)

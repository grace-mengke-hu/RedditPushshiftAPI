Super excited about Pulmonary Function Test Results :)

I have asthma. I also smoked off and on for 10 years. I definitely noticed that smoking exacerbated my asthma...Obviously. But quitting smoking is hard, so I'd cut back and deal with it, and take my rescue inhaler from time to time. I've also been on Flovent for asthma maintenance for most of my life, so I kind of just dealt with it.

Anyway, I quit smoking 46 days ago. Then, two weeks ago, my doctor made me take a pulmonary functions test to check in on my asthma, and I killed it. My lungs are doing super well (my doctor said my results are "excellent")!! She even suggested that I cut back to half my dose of Flovent and monitor using a peak flow meter to see if maybe I can use less (and maybe even no) Flovent. 

I'm really excited about this possibility and these test results and I wanted to share that.

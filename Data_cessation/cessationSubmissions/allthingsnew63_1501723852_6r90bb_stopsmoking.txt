40 days on the patch - a few thoughts so far

So first, I'm just so tickled to death that I am 40 days without a cigarette!  Yay!  And sorry for the southernism.  :-)
I see a lot of people going cold turkey.  When I began this journey, it never entered my mind for a second that I could do it that way, unless someone was kind enough to lock me up for a couple weeks.  However, I am where I am and again, extremely happy.  But I do not believe that I can let down my guard.  I am still on nicotine.  I've been concerned about stepping down and eventually giving up the patches altogether.

I've been reading the Allen Carr book. I'm not done yet, but I have hope that when I'm done, it will help with my concerns.  I can tell you that I already have a different attitude about this.  I ahve absolutely no desire to ever smoke again and I don't feel deprived.  All I'm worried about is not becoming a homicidal maniac.  

I haven't been wearing the patches at night when I go to sleep, so Monday night, I decided to see what would happen if I took off the patch at 7:50 PM.  I decided I would put it on when I needed to.  Made it till 8:15 AM when I got super angry and stressed (that panicky out of control state).  Tuesday night, 7:30 PM till 8:30 this morning.  Tonight, I took it off at 7:00 PM.  Conclusion, I do fine without it as long as I'm not stressed.  Get to work and I lose it.

I'm thinking tomorrow I will take it off at 5:00.  Anger management?  Lol.  The thing is, I need to learn how to deal with stress another way or dig deeper into my psyche or something.

Because I will not smoke again.  I will not.

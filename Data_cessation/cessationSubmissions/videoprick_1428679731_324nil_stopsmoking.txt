Best Friend Ever

I wanted to share this, and I figured you would all appreciate it.

Quit 5 Days ago, been consistently for about 6 and a half years. I quit after I found out a friend my age (25) recently got diagnosed with lung cancer. That really tore down my wall of denial. I've been using the patch (got them for free from NY state) and chewing on the teatree toothpicks. I've tried cold turkey 3 times, but the withdrawal always beat me at about a week.

I live with two friends, one has always been a non-smoker and the other is an on-and-off smoker so we decided to quit together. Well the other night, I reached behind our couch to get my phone charger and found a full pack (we had someone stay over so it might have been theirs). I opened it up and pulled out a cigarette, and no lie I kinda enjoyed just holding the damn thing.

Well before that feeling could really sink in, my non-smoker roommate grabbed it and crushed it in his hand. Then he took the pack, walked over to the kitchen sink, poured water on it, and threw it in the trash. 

It's nice to have such vigilant support.

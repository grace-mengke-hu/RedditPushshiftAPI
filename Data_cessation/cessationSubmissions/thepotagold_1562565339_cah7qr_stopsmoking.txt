how to get over the mental block of living smoke free?

I've been a pack a day for years now, and I've been wanting to quit for years now

I've made hundreds of attempts but still every time after around 10- 24 hours in, my addiction brain kicks in with ' just have one now and you can quit tomorrow' and I fall for it every time, I try to hold it off but in the end it wins (i just brought another pack after 14 hours)

I think this stems from a mental block, since ive been smoking from a really young age its hard to picture living without smoking, but I am now 20 and was thinking id quit by 18, I don't want to be still trying to quit when i'm 25.

bonus question: i am unfortunately currently jobless so another factor that makes me smoke is having nothing to do, what would be some good ways to not fall into the trap cause of boredom.

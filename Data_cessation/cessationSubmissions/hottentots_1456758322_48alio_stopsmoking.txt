The "quitting flu" ?

Anyone else experience headaches and dizziness? I was out shopping yesterday and suddenly had tunnel vision, felt nauseous, and felt like I was gonna faint. I didn't, and I made it home okay, but I had a horrible headache the rest of the day and thought, "fuck, I'm getting sick."

But I looked online and saw a few websites stating that all those symptoms can accompany quitting smoking. I only quit on the 24th after stretching out my last pack for a few days. I don't feel any cravings, except the situations when I smoked out of habit that we all know so well (after eating, while driving, on break at work, etc). But those cravings only last about a minute. 

This definitely isn't gonna make me start up again, but damn, I feel like every hangover I've ever had has come back to pay me a visit.

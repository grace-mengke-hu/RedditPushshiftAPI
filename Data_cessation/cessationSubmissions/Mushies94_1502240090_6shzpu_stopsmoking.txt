Just had wisdom teeth surgery, taking this chance to quit smokes after 4 years.

I been smoking cigarettes from 19 to now 23. I got hooked on many different drugs too. I quit almost everything and today I'm taking this wisdom teeth surgery chance to try quitting cigarettes for the first time and kicking my weed habit too. It's crazy how addictive cigarettes are, to me it's more addictive than cocaine and opiates. I've been opiate clean for 4 months, sadly today I'm back on Oxy for pain, but it's fine since I'm quitting cigarettes and once the wisdom teeth pain goes away, I'll say bye to Oxy again.

Btw I have severe osteoporosis and broken lower back (Lumbar L1 compression fracture)

It's been over 2 years and I have severe low back pain and I haven't worked. What I got to lose if I quit cigarettes now and I might have a 1% chance to overcome my physical pain with the power of my mind? also improving my bones and overall health drastically.

If my health is at its lowest, then fuck paying 10 bucks a day to make it worse. It's time I take control of my health, and be strong enough to go through life with a broken spine.

This is the moment where my health breaks me or makes me the unique person I am.

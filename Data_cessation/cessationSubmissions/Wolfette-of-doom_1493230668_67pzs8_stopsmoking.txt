3 days in, already agressive, depressed and hungry

Hey guys, I stopped 3 days ago and although I feel proud of holding for so long even if it's nothing compared to what do many of you have gone through already. I smoked almost a pack a day, if that changes anything, for 1y and a half. I noticed I became super aggressive. I work in customer care but I find it too hard to control my anger. I could before, but these last 24 hours have been horrible. With my SO too, I got angry at him so much. I also feel super depressed and empty without reason. 

Is this normal withdrawal symptoms? Considering going back to smoking because of these awful feelings. I don't even get that many cravings, it's just my mood shifted suddenly and it's a bit scary.

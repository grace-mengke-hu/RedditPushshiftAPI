Years of trying, but this time feels right

I've been smoking since 18 and it has always seemed like a complement to pretty much any activity I do.  Golf, bars, restaurants, hiking, work, whatever.

I attempted to quit last fall and made it 3 months but got dragged back down from winter (I live in Wisconsin and the boredom can kill any amount of progress).  With spring here, I'm trying to get back on the path I started.  

Quiting has always been easy for the first couple weeks but prolonged success has been difficult.  Any tips on how you maintain sustainability would be great!

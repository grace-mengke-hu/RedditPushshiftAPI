Five days! Looking for advice!

Long time lurker, first time poster.  I created an account just for this sub because this step in my life needs some support.  I've been working in car sales for a few years and I picked up my habit about 6 months in.  A lot of other salesmen smoke and just like any other job it's an excuse to tuck yourself away for 10 minutes and decompress.  

It started with just 1 or 2 a day and and as time went on I found myself heading back to that corner almost every hour.  Just sold a car? Go have a smoke to reward yourself.  Just had a tough customer?  Go relieve that stress with a stogie.  Just finished a long task?  Time to have a smoke?  Days getting slow?  Might as well go have a smoke to pass the time.  

I want to quit for a lot of reasons.  My family, money, my health, but the biggest thing I hate about it is that I feel like it has control of me now.

I'm doing okay with cravings, but when they do come I can get irritable or impatient.  

Is cold turkey the best way to go?  Does anyone here have any mental excercises that help them?  Is switching from cigarettes to another form of tobacco less nicotine a good stepping stone or is it just another crutch?  Would love to hear some of your successes and some of your failures and especially what you feel led to those successes or shortcomings.

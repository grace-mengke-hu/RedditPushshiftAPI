Baby Steps

CongratulationsðŸ˜„!  I'm on day 6 and feeling pretty good about my achievement so far.  Been a smoker since 1969 and it is hard to shake the image and reputation.  My wife is still smoking and keeping it secret (she thinks).  She was a non-smoker when we met and married and is now having difficulty letting it go.  I feel guildty for being the one that helped her get started.  She has been wonderfdul support as have been my family and close friends.
My wish is that the number of days as a non-smoker is not my new identity.  I want to be able to have normal communication without someone affectionately saying, "Wow! I'm so proud of you". I hope I don't have to wait 48 years to get a new identity.

Nearly a year. Withdrawal symptoms/benefits. Is it just me?

I've been smoking for nearly 30 years.  a pack a day for the first few years and a pack in two days the past 10-15 years.

So I did a cold turkey quit on January 16th of this year.  I'm still smoke free and have no urges whatsoever to pick up another cigarette.

It was tough the first couple of days.  After that, it was just insomnia for a couple of weeks and that's it.  Glad I didn't have much of the withdrawal symptoms.  No phlegm or any kind of mucous.

But... I don't feel any different.  My body doesn't feel any different.

Never really coughed before so not coughing now.
I don't smell more things
I can't really taste more things
don't really have whiter teeth

not really sure what I'm trying to say but I'm glad about quitting and don't regret it at all.

For those that are on the fence or thinking about quitting.  STOP thinking, just do it.  It's not as hard or painful as you think.  You know deep down it's the right thing for your body.  

on this Thanksgiving, I wanted to say thanks to everyone on this reddit.  It was great reading and learning.

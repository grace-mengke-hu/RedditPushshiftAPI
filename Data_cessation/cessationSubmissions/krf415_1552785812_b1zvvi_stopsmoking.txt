I screws up

Damn I smoked one! BUT... I still went a month and 6 days without and have not even wanted to until now so I consider that a success. Weird part is I wasnâ€™t really craving I just did it because it was a party, let loose kind of day.  Not beating myself up... moving forward.
Not caving because of one slip!!!

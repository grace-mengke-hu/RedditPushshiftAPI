Here's something to make you quit

I smoked. A LOT. I am 38 years old. I have COPD. 

I was a model in the 80's and early 90's and smoking was a lot more prevalent then. I smoked instead of eating...ALL THE TIME. 

I have had three awful bouts of almost dying. I've had a tube shoved down my mouth a few times (intubation). I really don't expect to live much longer and I can't say I really want to with all the issues I have been having. It's not worth it. 

Saddest part about it is that I still want one. I'm an idiot for saying it but that's how bad the addiction is.

38 kids...38! I'm not even 40 and I have COPD. 

This is a real good way to completely kill yourself...slowly and extremely painfully. I'm opening myself to PM's if you need to hear  how truly awful it is. But, seriously, try being 38 and not able to walk a block. It sucks. I'm here to kick your asses into gear. Do not smoke. It's a horrid way to go. I mean that.

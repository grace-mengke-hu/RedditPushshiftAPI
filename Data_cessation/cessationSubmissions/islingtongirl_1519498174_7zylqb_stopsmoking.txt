Is anyone else having these 'symptoms' since quitting?

Hey everyone.. just to give you background. I was a smoker for 17 years, usually 10 a day, on some days more. Essentially a smoker my entire adult life, started at 17 years old, i am now 34. Anyway.. i quit on 3rd February - 22 DAYS AGO! Still cannot quite believe it myself, but i am hoping it continues. I quit using the Alan Carr 'Easy way to stop smoking' book. it has worked for me I am not using any substitutes, literally read the book and thats it. HOWEVER.. since stopping.. i have the following things going on... and i wondered.. is this normal?/just me etc?

- bad skin/breakout of spots. I normally have excellent skin but my cheeks are covered in spots.
- slight insomnia
- when i am asleep, very strange and vivid dreams. Mostly about death (which i think means the end of a chapter?)
- eating constantly. esp sugary things. Really dont want to put weight on!
- constipation 


I am hoping that these things (especially the skin) only last a short time?
any advice appriciated!
On the plus side - i wake up in the morning and jump out of bed. I smell nice and fresh. I can breath in and out really deep. I am not spending Â£10 every other day on something that is killing me. I am also sat here drinking a glass of red wine as i write this, and, shock horror.. i dont want a cig!!

Thanks for reading :)

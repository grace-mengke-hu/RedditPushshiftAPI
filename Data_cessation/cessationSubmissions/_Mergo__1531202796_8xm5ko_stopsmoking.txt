Why I Will Never Smoke A Cigarette In My Life

At around midnight a large fire started blazing outside our front porch, I was in my room about to fall asleep when I heard my brother yell. My mother was in her room asleep. My brother tells me to leave through the back and my mother tries to fill a small bowl up with water to put it out. The fire was put out by a neighbor however the smoke and ash was everywhere. I got around the porch to see what caused and what do I see? A pile of fucking cigarettes and a burnt cardboard box. Cigarettes caused the fire, my family could've died because of a fucking cigarette lighting a cardboard box on fire. The only one in the house who smokes is my mother, we got her a vape to try and get her to switch but obviously it didn't work. My mother has probably been smoking since her teens and she's 48 now. This isn't the first time something like this has happened, 4 years ago my mom left a cigarette on our bench and that caught on fire too. When I was little she had a methamphetamine addiction and she only quit because she got into a car accident, died 4 times and was in a coma for two months. If it takes her almost dying to quit a bad habit or addiction I never want to touch one of those sticks of death in my life.

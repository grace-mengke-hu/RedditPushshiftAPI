So I've decided to quit smoking after 8 years, and I did some calculations.

I smoked about 2 packs a week. I live in the south, where the average price per pack is around 5 bucks. In 8 years I spent $4000 on cigarettes. 

The number that shocked me the most was that in 8 years I smoked 16,000 cigarettes.

Fuck.

ADHD guy again. I'm going to go to work and leave my wallet at home so I CAN'T buy any more smokes today. May I request a few words of encouragement, please?

Hi, I'm the_bagel_man. You may remember me from such posts as "ADHD-can't remember that I'm quitting." Well, today is the day I'm giving it my all. As I mentioned in the title, I will be going to work without any money so I will have no ability to purchase cigarettes from the store next door. I feel excited and ready, but I know I will also feel weak in about 3-4 hours. Can anyone spare me a few words of encouragement so I don't feel all alone and isolated? I promise I'll give it back to the community ten-fold once I get used to this new habit.

Btw, even though I haven't been successful yet, I think this sub is outstanding in the amount of love and support we should all show our fellow humans. You guys are special and I hope I can join your ranks as "former" smokers very soon!

Love,
TBM

Update: I did it! I've gone longer than 8 hours without cigarettes before (every night, if you count sleep) but today was the first time in several months I successfully willed myself not to go out during my break and light up! I sat in the break room and did my crossword puzzles. At lunch I was fiending, and I know there's a lot more work left to be done, but now I know I'm strong enough! Thank you, everyone, for your kind words of encouragement! Things are looking up!

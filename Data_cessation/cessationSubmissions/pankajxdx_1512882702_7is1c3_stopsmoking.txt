1 week in. Cold turkey.

I quit cold turkey over a week back. The thought of smoking doesn't affect me anymore.

Experience:
As many already know the first 72 hours are the hardest, and they were. For the first two days all I had in my mind was cigarettes. I had to divert my mind off it every minute to get any work done. 
It started to fade away by day 4. You realize you have gone for hours without thinking about it, and even if the thoughts comes by it's much easier to push it away, it feels great.

it's day 8, and I don't think I'll relapse. I'm loosing interest in keeping count of days now.
Now I can finally take deep breaths again, you know, the real ones.

For ones who trying to quit: 
It's actually not that hard, just push through the first 3-4 days. Needless to say it's worth it.
I would personally advice to go cold turkey. And _do not_ see it as a process, instead see it as an event. I quit on this particular date, that's all. Maybe make a note of the date at some place. And from that day onwards you are a non-smoker. If your friends offer you, you just say "No thanks, I don't smoke". Enjoy the new you. Much easier to do it this way, than trying to cut it down and fight the urges or replacing them with patches, vape, etc.
What I realized while doing it was that quitting is more of a mental thing than physical. You need to change your mindset and the way you perceive cigarettes. Once you do that you take the control back. 
Cheers :)

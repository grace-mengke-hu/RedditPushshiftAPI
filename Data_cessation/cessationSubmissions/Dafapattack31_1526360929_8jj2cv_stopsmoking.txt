Something bothers me more than the days saved or the money saved but ...

2,071 cigarettes not smoked. I never even thought about how many cigs I smoked outside of 24 hours. 2000 is a metric fuck load. I can't imagine when I started smoking (15) that at one point in my life the amount of cigarettes I would have avoided would be anywhere near that amount. I'm near 3 months in and to all the people out there that are still contemplating quitting or those hanging on by a thread look at this number. Its nice to be a non smoker.

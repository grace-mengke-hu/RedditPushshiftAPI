It seems impossible to stop...

I managed to stop, I'm doing it because I wanna improve my life, I went through a very bad breakup, I literally wanted to kill myself, but one day I said fuck it, I joined gym, I'm following a good diet and I stopped smoking. But there are days... where the stress and sadness hit you so hard that only a cigarette can calm you down, not even xanax has the power of cigarettes. So I gave up today and smoked twice.. it calmed me down but I'm so disappointed with myself. I know I will do it again... and again, and again...

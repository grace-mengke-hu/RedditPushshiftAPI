Here I go again!

Day 1... we meet again.

I made it about a month on my last attempt before I caved after stopping Chantix early because it was making me feel kind of crazy.  Now that the holidays are behind me I’m ready to try again.

I read Allan Car’s Easy Way but I’ve decided to go with the patch this time because I don’t have time to deal with the nightmare that is the initial withdrawal. Going to try and taper off as quickly as possible and leave this nasty habit behind me for good!

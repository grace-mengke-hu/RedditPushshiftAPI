Another smoking dream

These smoking dreams need to stop. I vaguely remember the dream but it seemed to be a longer one. I smoked multiple cigarettes, remember I had a pack. It was such a nice feeling to smoke but I hated myself for it. Completely lost respect for myself but it felt out of my control. I couldn't stop myself from smoking but I couldn't stand myself for doing it. It's been about 70 days since I quit, I hope these stop. I'm glad it was just a dream. It felt like a nightmare. I did not like that feeling. :(

Quitting Smoking For Good

What have yall tried doing to quit smoking? What has seemed to work the most? I quit for 2 years using vaping. Starting at 18mg nicotine and tapering down. It worked quite well but I had a large support system around me at the time and now not so much. I spend most of the day in my car because I do deliveries for work. This makes it even worse because everytime I get back in my car I'm triggered to light up another one even if I just put one out 10-15 minutes ago. I understand getting a new job but right now that's not possible. I've noticed if I eat sunflower seeds that I won't smoke while I'm eating them so going to try that but it's a lot of sodium! Wondering what everyone else has done. I'm sure there are methods I'm not thinking of. I have nicotine patches, gum, vape, and about to pick up a prescription for chantix but I'm not too hopeful. Vaping doesn't help as much anymore. Although if I get into the ha it of choosing the vape instead of the cigg it may.

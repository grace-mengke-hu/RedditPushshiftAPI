Close to day 6.

Had an hour and a half craving today a few hours after I woke up, but managed to sit and mope and argue with the voice in my head (my neighbors must think I’ve gone skitzo with all the yelling I’ve been doing lately) my way through it and was glad when it passed.  

Took a nice shower and while relaxing afterwards, smelled one of my neighbors light up outside my window and got so excited because it actually smelled disgusting to me!!!!! I didn’t exactly hate it, but it was enough of a stench to make my nose wrinkle and had me consider closing my window if it didn’t stop in a few minutes.  

What a weird and great sensation!

Panic symptoms within 2 weeks of quitting?

I've quit recently (12 days!), however since I've quit ice had 3 or so near panic attacks, and one real panic attack. 
I have a fairly anxious personality,  but nothing out of the ordinary and probably not an anxiety disorder.  Since I quit I have had a LOT of trouble keeping a lid on things anxiety wise. I think I was using Cigarettes as a way to calm down.

I have taken on some projects over the southern hemisphere summer and I am almost constantly stressed by these jobs.  Socially I am at odds with everyone because they don't have these projects (one is renovating a hoarders house on a next to nothing budget.  It's my mums house so there are so many emotions there) and my word non smoking brain takes issue that I am doing this and they are not.  Weird.

I am relying on my girlfriend more and more but I'm worried that over time this will errode the relationship.  I love her a thousand times and never want this to end. That thought is one of the things giving me panic attacks. 

Had anybody here had experiences like this?

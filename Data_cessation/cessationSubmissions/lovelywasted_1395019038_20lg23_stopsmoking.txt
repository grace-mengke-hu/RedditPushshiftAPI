Taking this opportunity to quit.

So, I just went a festival this past weekend, and it's pretty much all free alcohol all the time, so I always find myself chain smoking an obscene amount at this festival every year to accompany all the drinking. And every year, when it comes to a close, I get extremely sick from all the destruction I've done to my body. So, of course it happened again this year.

Today is my first day, but I want to take this as an opportunity to get rid of this addiction. The fact that I am actually able to plan my sick days is completely unacceptable. I want to be healthy, and I want to remove this addiction. Any help/advice/words of encouragement would be greatly appreciated. I've tried to quit in the past without success, and I live in a house of tobacco users. I could use all the help I can get!

By the way, I'm really sorry if this seems like rambling thoughts. I'm currently bed ridden with a 102.7 degree fever and tonsils the size of eggs. I'll try to edit this later when I'm feeling better for a more organized flow.

Same routine

Dumbass here. Not sure why I'm posting ..guess to just vent. So I've been smoking for over 15 years. The last 4 of them have been off and on.  Chantix has worked the last couple  times but here's the routine. I quit in July/ August ...determined to make it through the winter smoke free. I run 6 miles a few times a week. Then winter hits. I start smoking again for some unknown reason. Then finally when July/August hits I quit and start running. Well Ive bout a few packs here and there keep throwing them out but I definitely feel myself getting addicted. I bought some nicotine gum because I'm useless during withdrawal and I have a career/family to take care of. I'm still going to the gym and plan to tomorrow bit my mileage and time have decreased significantly. Idk. Hopefully this gum thing isn't a mistake because I know how it goes...I'll just have to quit the gum. Limiting myself to a few peices a day  for a few days. Hopefully making the right moves here.

I ran into to the road to get away from the store.

24 days smoke free. Today, I got drunk. I took a cab home which left me right in front of Vons, where I used to buy my cigarettes. I got a strong feeling to go in and buy a pack for myself. Instead, I got so scared of the thought, I ran onto the road and crossed the street to get home. I guess it's a good sign...

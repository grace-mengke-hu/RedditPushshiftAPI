4 weeks since I quit, I've hardly coughed at all?...

So I'm 24, been smokin since I was 16. I quit for weeks ago yesterday. I'm just wondering if everyone else started coughing up shit by now?

I know it sounds like one of those things smokers say, but I never really coughed much as a smoker either, is this normal? I thought after quitting it was a sign of your body recovering from the years of abuse, or maybe it just hasn't been long enough.

Would appreciate anyone's views, 
P.S I'm new to Reddit, can't believe how supportive people are on here :)

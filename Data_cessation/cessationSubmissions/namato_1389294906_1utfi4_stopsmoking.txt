Man down

It's been almost a week since I broke. After 167 days of being completely smokefree, I got drunk with my friends, lit up a few, and it snowballed from there. Before the day was done I had bought my own pack, smoked about half, and called it a night.

The next day I awoke hung over, had a few ciggies to ease me through the morning, and haven't stopped smoking since. For me, it all came about due to the logic of: "I'm not a smoker anymore, but if I want a cigarette I should be allowed to have one." Of course, this didn't work, because having one cigarette just makes me want another. My scumbag brain is also telling me that since I had such success with my first quit that I don't need to stop again right now because I proved to myself that I can control it. Clearly I can't

There's not much left for me other than the read 'The Easy Way," reset my flair and cessation nation app, and start over again. Pretty shitty feeling. If you're on the fence right now, try to stay strong. The grass isn't very green over here.

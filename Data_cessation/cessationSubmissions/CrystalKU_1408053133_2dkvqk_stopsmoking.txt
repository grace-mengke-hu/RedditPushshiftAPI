Milestone today!

It just occurred to me that at 8:00 pm tonight I will hit my 30 day mark. It also occurred to me that the last time I check my QuitIt app to see how long it's been since I quit was at 21 days. I think about smoking so little these days that I don't need that constant boost to get through cravings. I just wanted to share with someone who would understand how big of a deal this is!

First jog in over five years

I was a smoker between the age of 16-26 and I have now been an ex smoker for almost a year and a half. I attempted excersice a few times during those ten years and was always quickly defeated. Like i didnt last five minutes...

Tonight while i was having a beer, watching the new flat earthers documentary (it was ok) i got the sudden urge to just go outside. We got temperatures just over 2 celsius and the night air is crazy fresh so i decided to see if i could jog longer than a km this time around... 

Jesus fucking christ, my legs are aching so bad and my sides hurt and I cant stop giggling over how out of shape i have gotten, but fuck me. I ran about 6km before having to hug my knees and it had fucking nothing to do with my breathing. Three years ago i couldnt walk stairs without embarassing myself and now i can run again without dying! 

Its not an impressive distance, but it finally made me understand! Ofc Ive noticed all the small changes and positive side effects of quitting, but you get acustomed to those changes so quickly. This particular change hit me like a fucking fright train and I never understood how HEAVY having a smoking habit was.. . Its clear now though. Im never going back in to that snake pit.

To anyone struggling, fucking keep at it. Remember that luck wont get you there, only pure willpower and your fighting spirit will. Sorry for all the profanity.

Smoking will not be the end of me

Been over 48 hours since I quit smoking and I've had 7 short craving spits. When I'm riding through the crave wave I like to eat mint candies(mostly) or look up smoking forums/sites until its over. 
I haven't really noticed any withdrawals. Defintely feel the void at times. I go out on the porch with my bf when he smokes and do alright.I still want a cig when I see him smoking but I also know I'm done with cigs. Its kinda fansinating.
I know I shouldn't expose myself so easily though.
Also the first day with out smoking I would just suck on a cig without lighting it. Its like I'm trying to make a habit of going outside (filling that time void) and NOT smoking a cig. If that makes any sense. Lol 
I'm quitting because I want to be healthy. I don't want to look back at myself years from now and regret my choices. I refuse to let this poison continue to hinder me. I want to taste and smell better. 
I'm ready for change! 
Who's with me?

If I had a badge I would have to reset it right now

I fucked up tonight after having quit for almost 2 weeks. I had dinner with my mother--who is a chain smoker-- and stole one of her cigs to smoke secretly in the backyard. I didn't even enjoy it and now I feel disgusted with myself. I thought I had demonstrated a fair bit of self control the past few weeks but suddenly I found myself with a dart in hand even after the bad cravings had subsided.

I'm not sure what this means  for me--will I have to go through the horrible first 3 days again or was it just a blip?--but I am sure that I'm going to request a badge tomorrow. And i'm obviously going to have to be more vigilante from now on. 

Quitting is awful, but these fucking cigarettes are worse. Good luck everybody.

Allen Carr - Easy Way to Stop Smoking vs. Easy Way to Stop Smoking for Women. Is there any difference?

I'm about to purchase the book and wanted some feedback. I am a woman but I don't know if its just a gimmicky way to sell more books or if there's really a difference. Let me know what you think! (Ps - the women's version is about $2 cheaper. Obviously not a huge amount but I just thought it was interesting! )

Edit: I know this question has been posted before. I just wanted feedback from people who are currently active on this sub. I have read the old links and it seems like there's not much of a difference...

Checking my badge

I don't miss smoking at all anymore.  I moved and got a new job, and completely switched industries.

As it turns out, telemarketers smoke like restaurant workers.  I've completely avoided smoking at my new job, and take a walk on my break instead of gathering around the picnic table and smoking.

I've also lost my chronic cough and I stopped disappointing my wife and myself when I smoke.

It feels great, and didn't end up being as hard as I thought it would be.  I made my mind up real good and stuff this time.  After about a dozen quits of a couple weeks or so, I've finally quit for a year.  Maybe a year, I'll see my badge when I post this.

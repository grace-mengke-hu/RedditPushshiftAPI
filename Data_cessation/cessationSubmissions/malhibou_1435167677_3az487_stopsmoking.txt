Halp. I have murder-brain.

This is why it sucks to re-set. Broke my 2 week quit on Saturday, forgot how murder-y the first few days are.

I am in the last week of a very stressful job (yay for moving on!) but I feel like I can't even make it to lunch without crying or hurling something across the room. Please give me something positive to focus on!

EDIT: I made it through lunch! You guys are awesome. For my next trick, I will get through my good-bye party without telling anyone to suck a dick. That sounds entitled, but it's not really a party, it's just a staff meeting but with snacks.

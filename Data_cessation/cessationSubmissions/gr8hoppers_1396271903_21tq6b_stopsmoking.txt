Today is going to be a LONG day

My Dear Hubby is giving it a go today.  He is not TECHY at all.  We had to force him to get a cell phone.  It is an old flip phone.  This group has helped me so much, I ask each of you to give me anything that may help him since he doesn't access technology. I felt like I was starting all over again this morning as I could feel the tension ooozing out of him.  I am so proud of him and when I told him so - he said shut up. I get it.  Your first day you don't want someone to remind you about what you are trying to forget about.

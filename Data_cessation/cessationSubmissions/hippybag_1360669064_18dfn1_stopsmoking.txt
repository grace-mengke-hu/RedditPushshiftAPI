Stop saying it's bad time.

I keep reading posts where people are having a difficult time and some stress comes up and they feel like they will fail. I quit Dec. 31, 2012. That is about 40 days. On day 4 my mom went into a coma. On day 10 she was placed on a respirator to fully breathe for her. On day 16 she died during a tracheotomy wherein her kidneys failed followed quickly by everything else. 12 days from sick and due to be released to dead. Because neither side of my family get along and she was the only bridge between them, it has been all out war that I'm stuck in the middle of. I've had to deal with calling companies, moving out her apartment and making multiple trips to a funeral home because her death was so inconvenient neither of my brothers can seem to even go down to sign and have her cremated so I have to sign on their behalf. I just turned 21 on Feb 3 and have yet to have time to mourn her. I get to instead break down to thoughts of things she'll never see. Not my kids, not my wedding... not even the fact I quit smoking which would have made her so happy. She was the most important person in my life and I am utterly lost without her. So get out of here with your "worst time".... or maybe I should get out. This might just not be the place for me...but I haven't smoked.

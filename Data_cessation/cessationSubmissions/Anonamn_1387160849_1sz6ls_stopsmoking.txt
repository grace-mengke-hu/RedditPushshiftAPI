I feel worthless...

I want to start of by saying I'm an underage smoker (i know what your thinking). Ill give you a little backstory, i started smoking december 19th last year i thought i would try it and its been the worst mistake of my life, although it helped me get through my sever depression. About 4 months ago, my mother caught me and was fuming about this (my dad does not know) and yeh. Since that day I've tried to quit but I've failed, the longest amount of time I've gone with a cigarette is 6 days then i crumbled took one of mums cigarettes and fell back into a hole. I don't know what to do. When i try and quit i get depressed and anxious and i don't have the support other people have. Today is day one of no smoking for a 10th time. Im so disappointed in myself.

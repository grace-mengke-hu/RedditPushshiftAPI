Failed the first attempts i've had in years.

So I tried Allen Carr again several days ago and first try I fished my half finished pack out of the bin (eww) and tried again, cutting the book a bit short and just focusing on the bits I felt were most relevant. 

That attempt lasted twenty-four hours until I succumbed. I suffer from severe anxiety and depression and used it as an excuse to quit the attempt when I was feeling (admittedly, very) low. It had been going really well and I had no cravings until I over-analysed my situation and argued that because i'm out of work and back at my mum's place I still need cigarettes. Pathetic, I know - I disregarded all the mental conditioning the book prepares you with. I've been smoking progressively more over seven years of smoking and haven't attempted to quit since about five years ago [edit 3 and a half years. Thanks badge!].

I'm back onto rolling tobacco which comes in a minimum bag of 30g here in the UK and takes me 4-5 days to get through so my next attempt is unlikely to be for another couple of days. Any words of advice? Especially from those who've had success while living with mental illness. I know smoking is only making things worse :(

Thanks

Anyone else feel this bad?

I'm not really on the brink of starting again or anything, but I'm right at 2 weeks and I feel like shit. 

Is it a normal thing? I started running again, and I've always gone to the gym to lift after work, but recently right before both I start to get a little dizzy/nausea feeling. Nothing major but it makes starting my workout a nuisance. I've also generally been pretty sick but there has been a bug going around. 

I'm just curious if anyone else had had this nausea problem?

what else are you quitting? plus a tip that helped me

I've noticed a lot of people quit things concurrently. I'm stopping smoking and caffeine, and working on my sugar intake. I've noticed caffeine makes me crave sugar (and cigarettes)! I'm just curious as to what other people's journeys look like

And second, I was discussing the topic with my boyfriend, how realizing my caffeine intake affected my cravings. I mentioned it was like a fun experiment on my self, and that suddenly completely changed how I looked at this stuff. So I'm starting to look at stopping smoking as an experiment. How long can I last? When do I get cravings, what effects that? For some reason that perspective makes it way more interesting and even slightly easier, like I'm working on a project instead of struggling with a crutch.

What tricks do you guys use?

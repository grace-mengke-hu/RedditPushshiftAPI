Three weeks, yesterday

I had been considering quitting for a while, now. But it was difficult being surrounded by smokers. But a few weeks ago I went out of state to visit my family and didn't smoke the entire week I was there! 

I wasn't planning on quitting, but I didn't want to deal with not being able to hold my niece and nephew because of the smell, finding time to go outside alone, and getting lectured from my sister (doctor). It was easier because I was relaxed, I think. 

I used the nicotine lozenges, so I could enjoy my visit, but stopped those as soon as I got home. I didn't like the idea of still being hooked on nicotine. Also didn't like how it increased my heart rate. It's still difficult (yesterday especially), but I definitely feel like the worst is behind me. One week after my last one, I got really horrible flu-like symptoms, and they're only now starting to go away. Suffering through that made me realize how gross cigs are, and even if I still crave them from time to time, I know I don't want to go through that again!

A lot of the people I'm around still smoke or smoke ecigs. And sometimes the cravings get overwhelming. But I've learned to recognize when they're happening. This helps me realize that they seriously do go away within a few minutes. 

The phone app is really soothing as well. I use the livestrong "My Quit Coach" app. I just hit "having a craving," and it gives me a motivational factoid or tidbit that helps deal with the craving. I'm just taking it one day at a time. 

I read most of Allen Carr's book. But I'm a skeptic, and it seemed too preachy for me. For me, it was my personal decision to quit. I had to do it for me.

I just thought I'd share my thoughts. Reading some of these posts when it gets harder is reassuring and I'd like to contribute. Also, being able to smell and taste and breath again is delightful! You can do it, too!

Heavy smoker for twenty years. Haven't had a cigarette in 12 days and honestly don't want one.

So I went to the ER for influenza which had turned into severe bronchitis. They wanted to keep me at the hospital for observation due to a high fever (104.8) and low oxygen levels. Instead I opted to go home and ride it out, mainly so I could smoke. 

By the time I got home it had been about 6 hours since I'd had a cigarette so as soon as I walked in the door I lit one up. A single drag put me on the floor of my living room gasping for air and clawing at my chest. I literally thought I was going to die but I couldn't reach my phone.  By the time it passed I felt too embarrassed to call the hospital and explain what had happened. That night I tore up the entire carton I'd just bought and methodically flushed the contents down my toilet. 
 
That was almost 2 weeks ago and the bronchitis is gone but I still have a panic attack just thinking about smoking a cigarette. It's weird because for two decades I couldn't go more than an hour without having to have a pall mall full flavor 100. Now I likely couldn't force myself to smoke one. 

I assume this strange Pavlovian response will eventually pass but by the time it does I intend to have as much distance between me and my former habit as possible.

 tl;dr Thanks, bronchitis, you rock!

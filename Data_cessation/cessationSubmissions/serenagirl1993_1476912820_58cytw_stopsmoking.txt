Quitting when other smokers live in my house, (plus)?

I need help trying to quit smoking with others living in my household who also smoke. I live with my grandmother and father and my grandmother constantly asks me to go to the store for her and buy cigarettes which intensify my desire to smoke. I don't know how to say no considering she's well, old, and doesn't ask for much, just a favor of going to the store for cigarettes for her. I tried to start quitting yesterday, but today I caved after 28 hours, due to having to go to the store and buy her cigarettes and thus making me want to smoke. In addition both her and my father smoke inside virtually anywhere in the house.

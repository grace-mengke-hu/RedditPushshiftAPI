I quit again.

I've made my first post here when i smoked again after 100 days of not smoking. That was 27 days ago. I smoked for 24 days after that, almost 30 cig a day again. But l quit 3 days ago again. Since it's also Ramadan my hunger gets in front of my cravings for cig. So it's helping me very well. :)

Can't get past the 36 hour mark.

I keep "quitting" and then at around a day and a half buying a pack. I'll smoke for a few days, then quit again, and start the whole process over. Has anyone been stuck in this cycle? Have any tips?

Please don't tell me to read Allen Carr. I've read it. 

EDIT: Thank y'all!

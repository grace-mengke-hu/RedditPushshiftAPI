I'm on day 3, and its been the hardest so far.

Days one and two really weren't that bad, I would have a few urges and be able to easily work through. But I went out shopping this morning, and my anxiety was just through the roof the entire time.

I'm just angry today and my patience is incredibly thin. And I would love nothing more than to chain smoke an entire pack of cigarettes. I'm not going to though, but man I'm cranky.

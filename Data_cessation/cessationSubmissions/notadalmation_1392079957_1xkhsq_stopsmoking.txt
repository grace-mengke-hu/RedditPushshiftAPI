I'm so proud of myself...

Saturday night I was at friend's birthday party at his house. I'm 4 weeks right now and have completely avoided being drunk because it's always been where I relapse. Well, I had quite a bit to drink and was also around  several people smoking in the garage while playing flip cup. Not only did I not smoke, but one of my friends who loves to fuck with me CHASED ME with a cigarette saying "You know you want one!" and I told him to fuck off! Anyway, now I know that if I can be drunk and have someone even try forcing me to smoke and still resist, then there is no reason I shouldn't be good for the rest of my life. I just couldn't be happier. Stay strong motherfuckers! :)

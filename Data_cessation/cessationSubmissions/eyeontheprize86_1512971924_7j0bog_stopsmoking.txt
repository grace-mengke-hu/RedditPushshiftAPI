Three days in - most worried about being triggered by my “places”

After smoking a pack a day for almost ten years, I’m three days into quitting. The cravings have been intense and I’ve spent most of the past three days grouchy on my couch, but I’m really committed to quitting this time. 

I leave for a work trip tomorrow, a place I’ve been many times and where I have my “places” - the place I buy cigarettes, the places I go to smoke them. I’m anticipating it will be tough, and will continue to be tough when I get back and face my places here: the spots by the office where I would step away to have a smoke, the corner store by my apartment where I would always buy cigarettes. 

Any recommendations for breaking the routines beyond simply smoking? How were you able to disassociate yourself from your “places” and remain committed to your quit?

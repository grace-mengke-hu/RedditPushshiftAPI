Is there an ad free app ?

I quit smoking 10 days ago and switched to vaping, but now I'm quitting vaping too. I think an app that keeps the time since my last nicotine ingestion would help, BUT I JUST CAN'T FUCKING STAND ADS, it makes me angry and makes me want to smoke.


Would you, kind stangers, know if there is an ad free app like that ? Thank you in advance.

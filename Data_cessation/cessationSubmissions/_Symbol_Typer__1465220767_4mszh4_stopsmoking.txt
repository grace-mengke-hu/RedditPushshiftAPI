Trying to quit vaping cold turkey, having horrible results

Hi! I am trying to quit vaping. Currently. I was vaping 45mg and just Dropped it cold turkey. It's been a day and it's all I can think about. I'm dizzy all the time, have humongous cravings and feel like I can't go on anymore. I want it so bad. How do I overcome this? How long until I no longer want it anymore?

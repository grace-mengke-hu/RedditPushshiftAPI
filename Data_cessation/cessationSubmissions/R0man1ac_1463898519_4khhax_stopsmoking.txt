At eight days again.

Hey everyone. 

Eight days ago I smoked a cigarette with a co-worker after a stressful day. I was at 58 days without one. I figured I would just reset to be fair to myself. 

Back at eight days, just checking in to keep myself accountable. 

I know I keep resetting,  but I am still proud of myself for my accomplishments. In the past four months, I've smoked twice. I reset because if I don't, I feel like I am being dishonest. Not judging anyone who slips and doesn't reset, but for me, it just doesn't help keep me accountable. If anything it makes me feel worse.

So here I am, and here I will be. :-)

Quitting Tobacco, what about pot?

I'm working on quitting smoking cigarettes, have cut down sevearly the past few months and have recently started taking Chantix (Champix outside of the US) with hopefully stopping completely on the 1st of the month.


I'm also a regular pot smoker (or eater, vapor or any otherway of consuming it) and while I have done a pretty good job of stopping smoking around some of my other triggers (after a meal, taking my morning poop and driving) I always seem to reach for my pack after having a pipe or such.


Has anyone here quit while continuing smoking pot and has any tips  or should I just consider it impossible to have the sticky icky while I am going down this road?

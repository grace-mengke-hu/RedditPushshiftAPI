Day 4 - woke up smelling my fingers

I had a dream that I would have sworn was real last night.  I woke up tasting a stale cigarette in my mouth.  Then as the fog of the dream world lifted I realized that I have no cigarettes and no access to them and I smelled my fingers to be sure and low and behold I did not smoke.  It was just a really bad dream.  I was so dreading having to reset my badge again tbh :)

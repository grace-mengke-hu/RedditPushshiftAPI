19 y/o, quit cold turkey 2.5 months ago.

Started vaping 3mg nicotine e-liquid at 16. Within a year I was smoking cigarettes instead; eventually quit cigarettes with the help of vaping and moved up to 6mg, 12mg nicotine e-liquid. By 18 I was hitting a suorin with 50mg nicotine e-liquid in it, all day every day.

And then one day, on a whim, I just threw the device in the trash at a fast food establishment before leaving. Havenâ€™t had any nicotine since September. 

Used nicotine for 3 years and always told myself I could quit whenever I wanted to; when I decided I wanted to, I just did. GG no re

20 years, pack a day, 75 days on nicotine vaporizer

not sure how others here feel about he nicotine vaporizers, but i will share my experience.

I smoked for 20 years (1994-2014) 
I quit for 9 weeks for Army basic training
Grabbed a pack of cigarettes on the way to AIT.
I have tried quitting several times.
I have used gum, wellbutrin, and chantix.
I have also tried replacing the habit with cigars, chewing tobacco, electronic cigarettes.
Nothing worked.

I have just hit 75 days and 18 hours of no cigarettes with a vaporizer.
I would have spent $345 in cigarettes -- i actually spent $107 for the vaporizer kit, and nicotine liquids (e-juice) -- so i saved $238 in 75 days.

I started out with a 18mg nicotine flavored e-juice.
That lasted me 30 days.
Then I dropped to 12mg fruit flavored e-juice so I could break the flavor addiction (everyone has their favorite brand).
That lasted me another 30 days.

I am now 15 days into my 6mg coffee flavored e-juice. 

my next step is 0mg any flavor, and then to break completely with my vaporizer.

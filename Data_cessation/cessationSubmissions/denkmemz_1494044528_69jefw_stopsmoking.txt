4 days in and enjoying food again

 I just discovered this subreddit and recently just quit smoking. I'm only at my 4th day but already I feel a lot better and I've noticed I'm enjoying food again. I was in a convience store today and almost caved in and bought a pack, I had the money for it and it took all of my willpower not to do it. It felt like I was being tortured mentally. Also I work in a pretty stressful environment too and almost everyone I know smokes and I keep having to stop myself from asking these people for a cigarette because I know once I have one I will feel disappointed and smoke more. I just want to wish everyone good luck on quitting. It has definitely been the hardest thing I've ever had to do. I will not give up.

I had one of the worst nights of my life last night.

Been smoking for about five years now. Last night I had a combination of allergies, mild asthma, and the fact that I've been smoking about a pack a day all come down on me at once. I woke up wheezing and gasping for breath. Went to use my inhaler and it's out. Fuck. I tried to take deep breaths and control my breathing until it passed, but it was so bad I had to wake up my room mate to drive me an hour to my parents house to use my sisters inhaler. I'm over feeling like shit. This morning I flushed the rest of my pack. Wish me luck guys. 

TL;DR Had a horrible asthma attack. Done smoking.

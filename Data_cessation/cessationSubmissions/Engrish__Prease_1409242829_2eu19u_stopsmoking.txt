Felt so good to chuck the halfies

Going into day 4 and I feel awesome! 

I considered myself a "frugal" smoker. I'd smoke half a cigarette then would flick the cherry off with just a flick of my middle finger leaving a perfectly intact half a cigarette. Then smoke the other half later. I'd call them "halfies."

Yesterday I found some halfies in the garage from last week and it felt SO good to be able to throw them out. There was that split second moment/feeling of "Oh shit" because the old me would have been lighting one of them up but the feeling of breaking a cigarette in half is a completely foreign feeling to me and never felt so good!

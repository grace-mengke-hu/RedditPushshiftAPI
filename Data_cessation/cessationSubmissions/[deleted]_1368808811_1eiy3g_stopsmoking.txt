My boyfriend smokes

We have been going out for about 3 months and i love him truly, i knew he smoked before we was going out and ever since we have been going out he has been saying that he has quit, but some part of me thinks that he hasn't stopped.  There was one day where he thought he got cancer and checked with his doctor and the doctor said he was clean, and i know that you are about to get cancer from smoking.  I do tell him not to but he just says that he has quit, it breaks my heart seeing him do this to himself, i don't want to loose him .  If you have been through this then please help me, i dot want to see my boyfriend suffer xxx

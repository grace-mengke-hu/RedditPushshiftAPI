Broke down today with a small slip

So I tried over 30 times to call the company I ordered the laptops from as well as sent 5 emails to the person I have/had been in contact with, with no luck.  Decided this afternoon to go out for a walk and ended up at Starbucks. Got a coffee and headed out and ran into a friend outside had a smoke.  I asked them if I could have one, which they gave me.  3 puffs later I put it out.  OMG the taste.  Came home, cuddled up with me cat and feel asleep.  He didn't complain about the nap.  Not sure if I should reset my badge.

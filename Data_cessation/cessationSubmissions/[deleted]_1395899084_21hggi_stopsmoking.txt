I don't want to quit smoking.

25 days clean at the moment. 

I never was much of a chain smoker. I'd smoke anywhere between 0 cigarettes to 5 cigarettes in a day (up to around 10 on a drinking night). So I averaged my habit to around 4 cigarettes a day. I've been at this rate essentially for as long as I've been smoking (1-2 years). 

I don't get debilitating cravings. My lung capacity is mostly unaffected. The amount I smoke hardly dents my savings. Cigarettes don't control me. If I'm in a situation where I can't smoke, then I don't and I don't think about it. 

However, I enjoy the "art" of smoking. That is the mere ritual of lighting a cigarette and inhaling and exhaling smoke. I'm an antsy person and I take solace in doing something that simply *occupies* me. I feel no mental effects from what is known as addiction. My withdrawal when quitting was non-existent. 

I did quit though, because regardless it's damaging to my health and I don't like smelling like smoke. I also am saving a *bit* of money. But I overall just don't find that there's enough reason for me to continue not smoking. I want to get back to partaking semi-casually in the ritual I enjoy. I just can't justify not smoking at this stage. And yes, I'm aware that the addiction could escalate but 1. I have possibly the opposite of an addictive personality and 2. I'm confident that I'll recognize if the addiction is getting out of hand and that I'll be smart enough to do something about it. 

So tell me, why should I keep my streak going?

7 year smoker here, afraid to quit, in need of some Reddit love

I've been smoking since I was 15, and I'm 22 now. These past few years I have noticed the exponential nature of my addiction and have come to realize the destruction I'm causing my body. 

I feel frail and weak, and my lungs seem to burn with every expansion and contraction; even the unlabored breaths are a dull, painful reminder of my stupidity and a lack of foresight. 

I want to quit, but I'm afraid to do it.

I'm afraid of the withdrawals.

I'm afraid of the notion of (yet another) failure. 

I'm afraid of mindlessly and defeatedly handing over my money to the convenience store clerk out of habit. 

I know it's going to be a hard road, and I am shaking at the notion of it. 

I want to quit. 

I'm afraid of going beyond the point of no return.

Not being able to play with the children I want to have one day.

To leave my wife an untimely widow because of these stupid fucking cancer sticks.

I'm going out for a smoke now, and I'm down to the last few, I really want these to be my last, I just don't know if I can do it. I want to. I WANT me to want to. 

I need help people, I just don't know how to seek it. 

TL;DR: Whiny smoker here, afraid of quitting.

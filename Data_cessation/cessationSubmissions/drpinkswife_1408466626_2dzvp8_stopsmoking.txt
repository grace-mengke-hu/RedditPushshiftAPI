Got so angry today I threatened to buy smokes...

But even I didn't believe me. I went running instead. And I could go do the same run again because I'm still angry. I think I get more angry now.

My doctor cleared me to work, to run, but not to fly to Japan next month. I'm furious and sad. Yes I'm having a pity party!!!

Day 2 going smoothly enough...

Woke up early & with energy (completely out of the ordinary for me). Got some simple things done that I usually put off til they HAVE to be done. Both that & the getting up early felt really good, so it carried me on to starting the day in the office in a good mood. 

At work & not able to focus on anything. I've been bouncing between podcasts trying to get my mind occupied. My tounge is raw from all the suckers I've been eating. Picked up some pineapple juice for the vitamin C. 

The only real obstacle today so far has been passing the time without letting my cravings get to me. Every time one comes, I take a deep breath, acknowledge that I'm having a craving & that I choose not to smoke. That seems to be working quite well. 

Already planning projects to work on when I get home so I don't walk through the door & feel completely lost & wanting to smoke.

Small victory: no longer living a double life!

I just had a pretty significant realization a few minutes ago and am feeling pretty good about quitting, despite a couple of (very) rough days. Day 5 is much better than 3 or 4, keep going. 

I ~~am~~ was a secret smoker for 8 years (4 of those not-so-secret college years), and realized today that I'm no longer hiding my "bad side" from my professional life (co-workers, mentors, etc). For so long I've felt **my** worth as a human being was somehow diminished by being a smoker, despite being of the opinion that knowing someone else smokes doesn't change my perception of them, in fact, I used to think *more highly* of smokers... stoked I had people I could be my "true self" around. It's not that I was particularly concerned with what others thought of me in general, but smoking was a hard line: something I never let my co-workers know about. 

I know that many people won't relate to this or it may just sound like nonsense, but I hope that it can help someone else!

Edit: words.

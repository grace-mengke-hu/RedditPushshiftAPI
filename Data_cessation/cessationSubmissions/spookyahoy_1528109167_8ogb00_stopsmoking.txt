My parents are smokers

My siblings and I have repeatedly tried to get them to stop smoking, my oldest brother even got my Mom a vape to at least help her in the process of stopping. My Grandpa died of lung cancer from smoking and that didn’t phase my dad to stop. I don’t know any other options for them to stop. I’d like to see them live longer after smoking for decades. What else is a way to get them to stop or at least smoke less and work on getting them to stop?

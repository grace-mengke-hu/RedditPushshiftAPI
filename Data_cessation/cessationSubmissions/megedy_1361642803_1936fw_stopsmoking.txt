Thursday, February 21st, was going to be my quit day.

I had read somewhere, don't remember where, that picking a quit day in the future helps your odds of quitting smoking. So my dad and I picked the 21st of this month to quit smoking together. I was terrified about how hard it would be.

But then I got a really nasty infection from an impacted wisdom tooth Wednesday night, which required emergency removal Thursday morning.

So it's been pretty easy to stick with the quit day so far!

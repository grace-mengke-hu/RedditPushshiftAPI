About to be 48 hours cigarette free

I believe in myself more than ever. I need to take better care of myself. Today has been a stressful day. My grandma is in the hospital, on her death bed. Instead of reaching for a cigarette, I reached for my vape and took deep breaths, and focused in on the fact I am a non smoker, I am strong. So far there are 21 cigarettes unsmoked... I smoked 5-11 a day... mostly half a pack for 2 years, and then when I first started which was 3 years ago, it was about a pack and a half. I am going to share everyday of my quit journey. Tell me what to look out for, weird body side effects... weird anything.

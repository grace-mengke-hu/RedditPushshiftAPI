66 days and wanting to give up

I was doing so well. I was getting better, the urges weren't as strong, and I felt like I had made it though. I was officially a nonsmoker. But now, I am desperately craving a cigarette and have been for the past 24 hours. This sucks and I fucking hate it. I'm going crazy. Is this going to be me the rest of my life?? Wouldn't it just be easier to smoke and never quit? I was happy and I miss it. I miss being a smoker. Deep down, I don't want to go back to smoking, but I'm struggling so much. Can you all help me please? I'm desperate.

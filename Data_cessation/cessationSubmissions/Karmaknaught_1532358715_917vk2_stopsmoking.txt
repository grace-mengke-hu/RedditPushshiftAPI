Lies (4 Days Clean)

I'm 4 days in and this is going to be the attempt that finally ends 10 years of smoking cigarettes for me.

For me, smoking was connected to a bigger problem in my life: Lying. Lying to myself and others. I hid my habit from my parents and family and it has caused me emotional stress for so long. I'm kicking it finally because I'm tired of lying to them and myself. I felt pathetic. It has cost me time with my family, because I am eager to get away from them so I can go smoke without them knowing. It made me lie to people I love. It has cost me chances with women because I am embarrassed of my habit. I valued smoking over relationships. How pathetic is this? Well I'm done with it now. I'm finished with the stupid bargaining you do with yourself when you are addicted to something that you know will harm you and currently harms your quality of life.

I met a girl a few months ago and we were friends, though I was interested in her romantically but she was with someone at the time. She saw me smoke. Recently we have been getting together because she is available and I told her over dinner that I quit smoking when she asked me if I still did. I said goodnight to her that evening and was excited to get home to have a smoke, perpetuating these stupid lies I have been spewing for 10 years. Then it hit me. I'm in my 30s now. Am I going to keep lying to people? Am I going to keep lying to myself? When will it ever fucking end?? It has to end now for god sakes.

I'm 4 days in and I feel fantastic. I feel like I'm a new person. Not necessarily because I am finally quitting smoking, but because I am making a change in my life where I will be more honest with others and myself. This is it and it feels great. Smoking is a big lie and you shouldn't lie to yourself. Thanks for reading.

Final attempt?

Hello all! So a little bit of background, I am going to be turning 25 in a few months and have been smoking since I was 15 that's coming up on a decade of poisoning myself. I have only made a real attempt to quit about 2 times and the longest I have lasted is 10 days but fell off the wagon after going out for a friends bday. This was back in September. Anyways I have always promised myself that I was going to quit by the time I was 25 and now it's coming up out of no where and I'm terrified that if I don't quit by then I never will. My entire group of friends smoke including my roommates so it's really hard to stay away from it and remain in the right mind set. I've read Allen Carrs book and it was very motivating and helped extremely last time but for some reason I just cant stay in the mind set of being done with it all. Maybe I'm not ready? Will I ever be? Just would like some advice on how my next attempt can be final

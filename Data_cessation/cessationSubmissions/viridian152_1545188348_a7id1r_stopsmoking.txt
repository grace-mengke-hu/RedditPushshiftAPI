BF started smoking again- how to support him?

For background, we're both college-age guys. I've never smoked regularly but I was exposed to a lot of secondhand smoke as a teenager plus occasional vaping when my friends shared, and I'm already pretty predisposed to addiction genetically so I do get pretty strong cravings. I always stand near or walk by people smoking whenever appropriate, or just sit in the designated smoking area. My bf started smoking at some point in high school and quit shortly before we got together, so he was smoke-free for about six months. Not sure how long he was a smoker in the first place. Lately he's gotten super super stressed about school stuff and his mom's health, and he's started smoking again (roughly 5ish cigarettes a day I think, for the past week). He feels really bad and upset about this, and while I'm sad for him, I also really enjoy being around cigarette smoke, and think he looks super duper hot when he smokes.

My question is how do I walk the line between 

* Not wanting him to feel worse than he already does
* Wanting to support his efforts to quit
* and super enjoying it personally when he smokes, in multiple ways?   


Of course I feel guilty for being so into it, but unfortunately I'm really bad at hiding my feelings and reactions to things, and he knew about my reactions to smoking before we were even together, before he started smoking again. Any advice on how to be a good boyfriend (and also hopefully resist picking it up myself, lol)? Thanks!

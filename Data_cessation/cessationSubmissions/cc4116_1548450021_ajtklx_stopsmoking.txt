Caught off guard

Out of nowhere I was sitting here talking myself into going and buying a pack. I went to my app to see my days smoke free and came here. 
I haven't had a moment like this that I was ready to smoke. No reason really, not stressed or anything like that.
Started reading post, and now I am focused again. This site really does help.
Thanks

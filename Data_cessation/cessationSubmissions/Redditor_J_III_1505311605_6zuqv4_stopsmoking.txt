Smoked a cigarette yesterday confessional.

So I was having a stress-filled day yesterday.  You know, the usual.  Boss is a jerk, coworkers are incompetent, everybody you meet is a moron, the usual 'day 11' mood.  I walked outside for a breath of air, and one of my coworkers was out there smoking.  I have no idea where it came from, but the overpowering urge for a smoke came up and grabbed me.  Coworker was happy to oblige me, and I lit up.  Took about two puffs for the regret / feeling of stupidity hit me, but I smoked it all anyway.  Wrestled with the 'well, I smoked, might as well stop trying to quit and buy a pack on the way home' ...for about an hour before I regained my senses and determination, but I did.  So I smoked one.  I'm not giving in, though!

Honestly amazed I made it this far! Still getting cravings for cigarettes occasionally, but chewing the gum is working wonders for killing cravings or preventing them all together. Just like to thank all of you, this forum, and that badge, have been very motivational!

One thing that is concerning me though is that I haven't been able to taper off on the amount of gum I'm chewing on a daily basis. Anyone find it was difficult to quit chewing the gum when the time came?

Is it wise to stop using nicotine gum before 12 weeks?

Hi there! 
I quit smoking on May 3rd and have been using 2mg nicotine gum to keep me smoke free for these past 16 days. On my first couple of days I used 8-9 pieces of gum per day; for the next week and a half i used 7 pieces of gum per day and for the last week it has been only 5 or 6 pieces of gum. I know that I am supposed to keep using the gum for 12 weeks but tapering down is happening really naturally and I was wondering if anyone else had a successful experience of staying off cigarettes after quitting their NRT early. I have tried to quit smoking several times before and I would really like this to be the last time.

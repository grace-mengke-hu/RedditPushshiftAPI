Non-drinkers/Non-smokers/Non-drug-users...HELP!

Hello fellow reddit-ers! First time post-er here, have read often and found it very helpful, now with a question of my own.

Currently on day 46 and really it wasn't as hard as I had imagined initially, but have been struggling more in the past couple of weeks with finding an "outlet". I'm feeling pretty overwhelmed, stressed, and most frustrating of all depressed for really no great reason (I know I have a pretty great life and I shouldn't have much to be depressed about). I feel like it's related to not having that no-thinking/no-stressing outlet I used to have with a few drinks and some smokes. I have tried having a few drinks, but that just makes me want a cigarette so ends up causing more stress than it helps. 

So here's my question to those out there who don't drink/smoke/do drugs...what do you do to unwind?! 

*Here's things I already do (and did while I was smoking too): exercise and meditate daily, practice yoga regularly, get massages and acupuncture monthly. 

Thanks in advance folks and keep up the good work!  ðŸ˜˜

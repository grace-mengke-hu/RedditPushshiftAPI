Will I be okay?

This might be a dumb question but I was really curious. I smoke 1 or 2 cigs after I drink. I drink probably 2 times a week so at the end of the week at most I'll have 4 cigarettes. Could that affect me in the long run?  I know smoking is bad in general but for some reason I'm ALWAYS wanting to smoke after the night is over. Calms me down and I tend to sleep better. I know this is a mindset thing and I may need alternative but I just need to know if first off, is this okay? And if not what is a good alternative? Thanks guys

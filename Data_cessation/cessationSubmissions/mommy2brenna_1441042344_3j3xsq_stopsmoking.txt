Chantix - Day 1

I started Chantix this morning.  I discovered that my company is raising the "tobacco surcharge" from $50/month in 2015 to $100/month in 2016.  I can't afford an extra $1200/year for the luxury of smoking not to mention I'm looking forward to the health benefits associated with quitting.

Wish me luck!  I'll be a regular around here now!

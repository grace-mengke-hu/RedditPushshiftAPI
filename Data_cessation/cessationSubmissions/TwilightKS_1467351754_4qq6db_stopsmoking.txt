PLEASE HELP! I am at a serious problem right now and craving to smoke!

So today I found out WITHOUT NOTIFICATION, that my mother's and I joint account was closed with no specific reason except there was no money in it.  YET I ALREADY PAID THE DANG FEE THIS MONTH and as of last week it was open!

There is a problem MOM'S SOCIAL SECURITY RETIREMENT AND WIDOWS PENSION MONEY IS SUPPOSED TO BE THERE THIS MORNING!  I have no idea what to do and since she has dementia guess who takes care of her bills and takes care of her?  MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!

I'VE HONESTLY NEVER FELT SO MUCH DANG PRESSURE IN MY LIFE I JUST WANNA CRY MY EYES OUT RIGHT NOW AND I'M PANICING!  What about her bills? What about our money issue? What am I supposed to do if it's not there by like 8am? 

I called her old bank Chase and asked them if we could do an emergency reopening of her old account I closed (long story there). They told me I'd have to go to a branch, only one problem. I'm in Kansas, the closest chase bank......is in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

I'm going to seriously loose it I think :(

4 days smoke free and have never done anything so personally challenging in my life.

I am 4 days smoke free. I am a 25 year old female. I have smoked a pack (sometimes two) a day for 10 years. I quit cold turkey with the help of the Smoke Free app. I wish I could say I quit because I wanted to - but I actually have a breast reduction scheduled for the end of the month and my surgeon told me he would refuse the surgery if he even had a hunch I was still smoking. I guess the constricting blood vessels really effects the healing process and overall results of the surgery. So I decided I couldn't lie to this doctor as I (and I'm sure many other smokers) have done in the past. The first day was nothing short of completely horrible. I'm not sure which was worse.. the physical or the psychological cravings. The things I told myself in order to rationalize a smoke were questionable in my weakest moments. I ended up sleeping most of the day and spending a lot of time alone. Day 2 was less physical.. more psychological. I had lots of sleep.  Brought a baggie of carrots with me and ate them for the entire duration of any car ride. And managed to get through the day. Day 3 .. easier.  Irritable. Wanting to fight my poor boyfriend. Only to rationalize wanting to smoke. And now we're on day 4. Today is okay. When I want a smoke I brush my teeth and feel how clean my mouth feels. It helps.  I just find myself so scared.. I'm scared I'm not strong enough. I've never made it this far before and I'm scared to let myself down. I'm scared to be in a position where I don't have this subreddit or my app available to me to help me get through when my mind is taking over control of my body. I hate when people underestimate this addiction.

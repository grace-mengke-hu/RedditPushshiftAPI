I don’t know how the hell you guys do it.

Seriously, props to everyone here trying to quit.

I’m a freshman in college and I’ve had a daily smoking habit for about eight months now. I usually smoke 4-6 cigarettes a day tops. I could feel myself starting to get addicted so today I quit cold turkey. I was completely wrong and I was already addicted. Now I’m laying awake fantasizing about smoking and all day today I haven’t been able to focus in my classes, I’ve felt depressed as fuck, and I’ve been insanely irritable like to the point where LITERALLY ANYTHING will set me off into an almost rage.

Anyways I just wanted to say to those of you who have been smoking for years and are quitting that’s seriously amazing because I’m in agony and I’ve been smoking for 8 months and not even that heavily.

Day-1, Again!

So I finished Alan Carr's Easyway to Quit Smoking and it worked like a charm...until last night. I've been under a lot of stress lately, with job loss and financial troubles. So I haven't been sleeping. I lie awake and just worry about shit. When I do sleep, I have dreams about war/hard labor/struggle.

I was exhausted last night and I chugged a beer to help me sleep, and I guess because of the sleep deprivation I got a ridiculously powerful buzz off of it, approaching drunk powerful.

I wound up smoking three cigarettes.

And there wasn't anything there, they were just pointless. They smelled like shit and simply made me more sluggish, tired and angsty. In fact, those three really just made me look forward to this morning so I could wake up free again!

So, Reddit lets do this again, and make it stick!

EDIT: Bought a pack. Definitely need to re-read the book.

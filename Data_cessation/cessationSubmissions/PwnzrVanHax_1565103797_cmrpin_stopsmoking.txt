Process of Healing lungs

I've been smoking nearly a pack a day since I was probably around 15-16 years old. Almost 30 now, I am adament about quitting because of my constant cough and lungs beginning to feel a bit painful at times, but am wondering are there certain things I can do besides quitting obviously, to improve the speed at which my lungs can recover? I was thinking things like exercise might help, does it? Are there any other things I can do to stimulate lung recover?

I bought a pack..

This is my first post here so sorry if I’m breaking any rules or anything like that. So I quit smoking a year and a half ago and had an insane craving and broke down and bought a pack about an hour ago. I smoked one and it just made me feel awful about myself. I think this is the most guilty I’ve ever felt in my life. I texted a buddy right after and just have him the full pack. Sorry for rambling I just needed to vent.

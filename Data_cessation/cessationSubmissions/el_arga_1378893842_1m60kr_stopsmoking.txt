Waking up at 6 in the morning sucks.

I can't go back to sleep, because I have to take my meds. I used to go out, and walk around, smoke a few, and wait for the sun to rise. 

Not anymore! As much as I want one. As much as my body is telling me it's OK. I can't have one. Never again. 

This is the start of day 3, and the rest of my life. I can beat this.

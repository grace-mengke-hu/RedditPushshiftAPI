I f**ked up and I hate myself.

I have been very depressed lately and abusing my xanax prescription. Xanax makes me do things I'm less likely to do, and both of those together just made me smoke a cigarette tonight. I am doing the /r/thexeffect thing though, and I am motivated to just lose one red X and keep going. I have a few she bummed me, going to finish them (which I know I shouldn't but...) and then start right back on the horse tomorrow. I fucked up and I hate myself right now. But I know if I can do it tomorrow I will forgive myself.

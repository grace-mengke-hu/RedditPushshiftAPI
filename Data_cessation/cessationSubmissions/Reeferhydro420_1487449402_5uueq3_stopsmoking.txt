Smokers face?

When the hell will I lose my smokers face? I've quit smoking a week or so ago, I'm vaping at 3mg nicotine sparingly...but the whole "sucked in skinny rat" looking face isn't going awayyyy. My lips aren't black anymore, and wrinkles don't seem as noticeable(could be just in my head lol but yeah). Maybe the smokers face takes longer to go away? Or does vaping also cause smokers face?

I'm 23 and having been a pack a day smoker since around 18. I'm currently living such a stressful life that I've successfully accumulated a decent amount of white hairs. My fiance and I have a 2 year old, but my fiance has a brain tumor.

My question here is, during high times of stress like this, what's the best way/tactics I can use to quit? I've been chain smoking recently, and I can feel it getting way harder to breathe. But, I've been told countless times that if you can quit when you feel you need it the most, it'll make the coming months much easier. 

So guys, what advice can you throw me?

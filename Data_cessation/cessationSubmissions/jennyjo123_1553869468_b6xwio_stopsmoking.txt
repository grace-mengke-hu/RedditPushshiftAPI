Vape

Just had a couple of weeks where I fell back into smoking. It’s horrid - sneaking around so no one notices, hiding it from the kids and feeling like a failure. So when I wanted to go buy a packet for the weekend I went and got prepared with a vape instead. It’s worked before where I eventually just kept a vape with 0 nicotine in the house for those rare cravings after a few glasses... I got slack and didn’t buy vape refills and ended up smoking again. I’m so glad I didn’t go buy cigs today. Already happy to be free :)

Three and a half years later

I found reddit three and half years ago because it was recommended by the smoke free app. Think reddit is now the more serious addiction...but anyway

Here I am on day 2. I had one year of no smoking after a family member's cancer scare but otherwise have been flouting the not one puff rule and now have a wheezy chest, bad breath, brown teeth.

My partner ended our relationship just after finding out her dad had lung cancer. He died less then a month later. My clever brain decided that was a great time to get back into smoking again. 

Anyway, smoking is stupid. Don't do it. You can never have just one.

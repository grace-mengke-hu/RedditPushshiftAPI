Can finally run a 7 minute mile again!

Thank you guys so much... 46 days quit and I'm healthier than I've been in years. When I picked up smoking, I could run a 7 minute mile and on average ran 50 miles a week, oftentimes much more. I was also an avid weight lifter and was quite strong. About two years into smoking, I suffered an ankle injury that physically and mentally prevented me from taking fitness seriously. It took no time at all for my smoking habit to negate years of fitness, and once I was ready to be active again, I couldn't even run a 10 minute mile. My interest in fitness plummeted as a result of that injury and the discouragement from how bad smoking had fucked me over. Well, 4 years later and I finally quit FOR GOOD! I'm so fucking pleased that as of today I ran a mile in 6:56. Best time in years and I feel healthier than I ever remembered feeling!

Keep up the good work everyone, DON'T GIVE BACK IN TO SMOKING! When you're feeling tempted, say your life goals OUT LOUD then say out loud how smoking will prevent you from reaching your goals. Smoking has never helped you, it will only slow you down and get in your way. Stay strong!

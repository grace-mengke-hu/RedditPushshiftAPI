Terrible withdraw?

I smoked my last cigarette friday night. While I already feel a lot better on my bike and food has started to develop a flavor again, I'm suffering from a significant reduction in energy, nearly flu-like general discomfort and I don't feel rested from sleep. I'm aware these symptoms will be temporary - I was just wondering if anybody had good advice for easing this transition?

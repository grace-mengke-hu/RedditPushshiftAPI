Day 11, so proud that I have made it this far.

Yesterday was the first day that I felt like the physical addiction had left me. I still have to fight the mental part but that part is way easier than the gaping hole that you feel in your soul from the physical addiction. Anyway just to give some of the people who are on there 2nd and 3rd day a little hope and let them know that it goes away and get much easier. I am done with this nasty habit and I am not looking back!

Today I've hit 130 days of being smoke-free and I feel better than ever!

Today I've marked 130 days of being completely smoke-free. I've come to the point that I am even disgusted by the smell of smoke and I recognize when a smoker is passing me. I do not want to smoke at all, I have no cravings at all and I feel very healthy. I started going to the gym again and I am turning vegan as well. Reading this subreddit really motivated me, thanks for your support! Everyone can do it, it's all in your head!

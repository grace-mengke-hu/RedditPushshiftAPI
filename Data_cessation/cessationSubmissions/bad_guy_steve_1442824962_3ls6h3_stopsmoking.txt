Hey! I'm new here

Nice to be here!

I started smoking two years ago. Started small some cigarretes while drinking. Then I started buying my first packs, mostly because I had to stop drinking and in exchange for alcohol I started smoking during parties.
Then it began. I couldn't stop smoking because the job I was working gave me a lot of stress.
I quit job this january(back to studies) and stopped smoking for one month. But after that month I started smoking again. I was lending cigarretes from friends because I didn't have money(no job). It was hard to quit because all my friends are smokers, and whenever I had opportunity to smoke I smoked.

I really hope I will successfully quit.

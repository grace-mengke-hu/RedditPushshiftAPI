My daughters smelled my hands today. They said they smell nice, for once.

I never knew this bothered them for so long. Just this one moment has made feeling "whatever quitting poison feels like" worth it. Thank you r/stopsmoking for giving me the strength to quit. Double digits today! To everyone starting out today ---> Good Luck! It gets better.

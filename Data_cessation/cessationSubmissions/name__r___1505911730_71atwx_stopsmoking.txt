I guess I need to quit before it's a problem

I've been smoking since around 8 months now, not a lot 1 or 2 ciggerates a day (a lot more if I'm drinking but that's not very frequent). I had started smoking as a social activity I guess but I've realised thats a stupid reason to fuck up my body. Quitting for the first and hopefully last time. Wish me luck guys :D

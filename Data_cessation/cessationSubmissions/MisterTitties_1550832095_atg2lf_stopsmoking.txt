Advice for if I should quit

My problem isn’t exactly to quit smoking, but rather to get rid of a nicotine addiction. I’m in my junior year of college almost my senior and I’ve been vaping heavily since my junior year of high school. Honestly I don’t think there’s been a day in about 3 years that I haven’t done it. Nicotine is something that I used to love, but as I’ve grown older I fear that I may end up using it for most of my life. My parents both had nicotine addictions for at least 30 years, my dad was able to quit but sadly my mom still struggles with it. Not to mention my significant other has really bad asthma. I really have come to dislike my reliance on it however I’m about halfway through a semester in college that I cannot afford to mess up and I’m fearful that if I was able to quit successfully that my grades might receive a backlash from it. I feel like nicotine helps me focus greatly and I can struggle with computer engineering at times even with it. I have tried to quit before in the past, and yet I always come back to it. My last attempt was over Christmas break and I made it about a week before I broke. I like to read the stories on this sub whenever I try to quit as I find them very inspiring. So I guess all in all I’m asking is do you think I should quit now while I’m feeling really motivated to, or wait until this semester is over?

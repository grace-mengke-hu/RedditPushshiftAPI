Does anyone else feel immediate increase in energy levels from not smoking?

I always get more productive, more confident etc when I stop smoking for a day or two. It's like the withdraws give me an edge, makes me kinda wired. When I give in and smoke I can feel myself deflating. Shoulders slump, productive thoughts go out the window. I'm trying to learn to enjoy this feeling more than I don't like withdraws. Anybody else experience this?

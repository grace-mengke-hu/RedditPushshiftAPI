Try 2..

I have tried to quit a hand full of times, most of the time not real attempts, just 2 or 3 days. A few years back i took chantix for a few weeks and quit for a good 2 months. well its been 2 days since iv last had a cig. i'v had 3 nicorette lozanges since my last cig. figure if i can use these for a month or so it should be easier....who knows. still am yet to test myself after a few beers. will find out tmrw if i can make it through a night at the bar without smoking.

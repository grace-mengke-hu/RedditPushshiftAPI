Almost 3.5 months

Wow. Time flies and at the same time.. it feels longer than it actually is.

Almost 3.5 months (in a few hours).. still can’t believe how easy it is. Sometimes I still cringe like crazy.. but it feels like with every minute passed.. it gets easier to shake it off.

Just like a small thought that jumps to your mind and is gone within the following seconds. But I have to admit.. i‘m afraid it will always be there. A second shadow behind me, waiting for the right moment to strike. But i‘m optimistic! It’s easy to stay strong!

This reddit helped me a lot in the beginning and I want to thank you all and hope everyone stays free or is able to become free from this chains :)

Situations I can take without the need for a cigarette:

- Smoking areas (yeah.. it’s passive, but still don’t need to smoke. I entered it very early to test me - actually not the best idea maybe.. - but it’s not like I do that often. Happens rarely, still try to avoid it.. it stinks xD)
- On work.. everyone smoking around me. Was tempting at first, but I made it :)
- Busstops. People don’t care about you. They just blow it around (I always respected non smokers - but whatever) Holy cow o_O! I never knew how.. somehow desperate people look, when they quickly smoke a cigarette before the bus comes. 
- Cafes or Restaurants outside.. people smoking everywhere.
- In a car with a smoker. That was one thing I was very afraid of, but it’s actually super easy :)

Unsubscribing

I just noticed I was still subbed here on this old account. It's been over 2 years since my last nicotine an I don't even think about it anymore.

The fist couple weeks suck but it gets easier over time. Fight through the random urge and they get further and further apart. 

Do what works for you. For me it was ecigs for awhile before I stopped those.

Don't give up!

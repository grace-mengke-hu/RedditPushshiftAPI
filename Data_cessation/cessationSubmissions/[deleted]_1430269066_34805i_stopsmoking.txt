Tips to quit smoking when SO smokes and does not want to quit.

So this might just sound like and excuse, and maybe it is. but I want to quit, but I don't think I have the will power to quit if my SO keeps smoking, being around them I know I will take them from her and just fall backing into full time smoking. Have been smoking for about 4 years now. I tried getting some of those disposable E-cigs to stop, but they did not work well enough. I keep trying to get her to quit with me, so we can do it together, but she does not want to. any advise? 

**Edit: Title was suppose to be a questing, sorry if anyone mistook this to mean I have tips.**

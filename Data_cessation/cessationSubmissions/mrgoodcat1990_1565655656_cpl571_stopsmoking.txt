Had my last smoke tonight

For the first time in about I don't even know 8 months my blood pressure has dropped enough to be able to breath and not feeling as though I'm suffocating .

This is crazy , been seriously addicted to nicotine this past 8momths or so , when I smoke I smoke pretty heavily , and the stress I've put myself under from it is insane , 

Here's to relaxing ,being able to breath and not losing my mind when I'm both smoking and waiting for a smoke 

Oh and being able to taste and smell again looking forward to a good night sleep .

Fuck you nicotine lol

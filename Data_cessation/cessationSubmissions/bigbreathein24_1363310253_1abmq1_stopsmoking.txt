How a mouthguard is helping me and might help you!

So when I get very anxious/frustrated/stressed, I tend to grind my teeth and chew at the inside of my mouth (gross, right?).  Now with quitting smoking, I've been doing this more than ever and I'm constantly also chewing on my fingernails, cuticles, mouth, whatever. 

Bought a mouthguard to stop the grinding teeth at night (found at CVS for about $25 and lasts about 6 months) but have been wearing it all day for the most part.  I take it out to eat, talk to people, drink water, etc.  

It's been helping keep my mouth busy without being a nuisance and overall I think it's been helpful to me.

Writing this in case somebody has similar problems with anxiety and mouth/teeth stuff while quitting smoking.

Take care! :)

It's been one year for me. My dad had a heart attack Friday.

He had quadruple bypass surgery yesterday. He's now on his third day of not smoking after 30 years. My milestone is now his stepping stone. I didn't use /r/stopsmoking for any resources other than the counter, but I'm appreciative of that.

5 days in. Cold Turkey, Mom is staying with me for week, two young daughters stuck in the house, wife is away on business. Still going strong!

It's the perfect storm over here, but I'm still clean 5 days in. Cravings are high and I'm trying my best not to snap at my loved ones. I find these things help

* 1. Full dental hygiene after every meal. Floss,brush,mouthwash. Full ritual three times a day. I don't believe nicotine replacement works, but I would try a nicotine toothpaste. Nicotine would at least do something useful!
* 2. Ice water! 
* 3. Sudoku. I think using the logical side of the brain for a quick 5-7 minutes helps to get rid of the craving or at least distract you. Video games make me crave cigarettes for some reason, so I'm quitting those too. 
* 4. This subreddit. Just knowing that people are dealing with the same problem as me helps a lot. Seeing them overcome cravings in their own way inspires me.

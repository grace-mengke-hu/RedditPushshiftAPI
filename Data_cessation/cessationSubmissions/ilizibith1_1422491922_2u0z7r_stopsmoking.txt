Hey lady quitters, I'm like really emotional right now... is this normal?

I stayed home from work yesterday because I was too depressed to get out of bed. I have been crying all day. I'm feeling so insecure and vulnerable and I'm taking it out on my loved ones. I'm totally not myself... I feel crazy and out of control.

I do have some hormonal issues relating to my period (which is scheduled to start in the next week or so) that I'm working on with my doctor and I need to know... am I crazy and depressed because I'm getting my period, or because I'm not smoking... or am I just crazy?

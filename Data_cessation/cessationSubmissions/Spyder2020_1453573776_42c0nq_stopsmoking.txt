Approaching 90 days

I have been smoke free for 87 days now while using the patch and gum. I quit chewing the nicotine gum about 30 days ago and am still on stage 2 of the patch. I've noticed in the last week or so my cravings have been much more intense. Not only in severity but also length of time. Has anybody else ever experienced this, a recurrence of strong cravings? I feel like I did the first 2 weeks after quitting.

How to enjoy music again without smoking?

This is the hardest and strongest trigger for me. 

I used to love smoking while listening to music or while watching contemplative movie scenes. It was such an amazing experience. Felt like it put my brain in a meditative and contemplative state and I loved it.

Obviously it's all in the head and it's just the addiction speaking and all that but it's just... so difficult. I feel like I'll never be able to enjoy music ever again if I stop smoking. Honestly I'd rather kill myself slowly by smoking than lose this.

I know it sounds like I don't actually want to quit but I really do. I just can't find a way to enjoy these special moments without smoking...

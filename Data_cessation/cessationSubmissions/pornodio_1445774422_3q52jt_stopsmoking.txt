I smoked again goddammit

somehow I fucked up with patches dosages. They started giving me weird symptoms (tachycardia, anxiety, depersonalization) after 4 or 5 days and I had to go on lower dosage but then I couldn't adapt good on the days I had off work (weekends mostly) when my body is used to have more nicotine mixed to caffeine ironically. 

My problem is I don't trust myself anymore because I've said to myself more times "this is your last cigarette ever" and then broke the promise so I don't know how to manage cravings when I'm low on nicotine concentration

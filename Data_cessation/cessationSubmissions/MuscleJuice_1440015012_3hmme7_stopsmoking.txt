Day1 of Quitting - Hopefully never again.

Well here I go, new home gym setup, last hurrah last night has been completed and now the hard work starts. I have been 1 pack a week (sometimes 1 pack a month) smoker over the past 4 years and it's time to stop for good. Wish me luck, here is looking to a healthier tomorrow.

30 years smoking tobacco constantly, stopped 8 weeks ago and now vape.

I started at age 11. Smoked pretty much every day, a lot, until 8 weeks ago, for over 30 years. I bought a vaporiser, and just quit. I now just vape. I was having major issues with my gums, nearing tooth loss, 2 at the front, bottom row. Not a good look I think you'll agree. Since stopping tobacco, my gums have calmed down and I don't smell anymore and generally is a step in the right direction. I am happier and healthier without cigarrettes. My addiction was so strong to roll ups, I am just glad I have made this change and wished to share it. I guess eventually I'll cut down and cut out vaping as well. Am 8 months from stopping alcohol as well, which was also a major problem. These changes turned my life around, I want to be a good role model as a father, and a man with integrity and health in my middle age and beyond.

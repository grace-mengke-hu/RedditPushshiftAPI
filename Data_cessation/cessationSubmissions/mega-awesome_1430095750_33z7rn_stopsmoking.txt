277 Days in and today I ran 17KM

I just stopped in to check on my flair, I know I don't come around here much anymore.  I'm now training for a half marathon. This morning, I went out for my long run and at about KM 3 I saw a girl sitting on her front porch drinking coffee and smoking. I was reminiscent of when that would be my perfect way to spend a Sunday morning. For just a second... until I remembered I was fucking RUNNING, and how cool that was!

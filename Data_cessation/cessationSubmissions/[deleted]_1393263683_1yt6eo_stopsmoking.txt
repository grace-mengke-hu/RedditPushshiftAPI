81 more days until I've reached a year!

It's been a constant battle, some days easier than the others but in the end I just keep thinking about all the benefits I've gained from not smoking to stop myself from wanting to even have one cigarette. 

Today is definitely a hard day but when I think about how short of breathe I was, how badly my hands smelled, the dirty taste in my mouth and how much worse the hang overs were the next day are more than enough reasons to keep myself from smoking. I haven't completely detached from the idea that I'm not a smoker anymore. Every now and then I still get cravings, I still get that idea of wanting to just smoke one but I know that will only lead back to a pack a day again. It's taking all the self control I have to not do that right now.

I really appreciate this place because when I craving it really bad, I come here and type it all out and that alone is a huge relief.

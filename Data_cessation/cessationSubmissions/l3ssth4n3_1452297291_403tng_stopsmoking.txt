950 days for me. How cool would it be if 2016 was the year you quit smoking?

I made a new account after some real life people found my reddit account, but I used this subreddit to help me quit back in the day. I was a pack a day, menthol smoker -> vaping -> no tobacco or nicotine for two and a half years now. I hardly even think about it anymore. It helped me to have been quit drinking for awhile when I stopped smoking. I just wanted to give you new year's quitters some huge support. You can do this, and you'll be so happy you stuck with it.

I'll never forget when the person I was dating last year said, "I can't even imagine you as a smoker". YES!

Message me anytime if you need a reminder, or someone to vent at. :) <3

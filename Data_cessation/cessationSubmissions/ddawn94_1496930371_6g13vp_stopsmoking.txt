Made it a whole week!

After being a smoker for 5 years (started my first year of university) I have officially made it a whole week without a smoke. It's not my first time quitting, but I am determined to make it stick this time, since I'll be starting grad school in the fall and I don't want the extra expense of smoking + can't afford to be sick all the time. The first few days were hard, but today I didn't have a single craving and I feel great!

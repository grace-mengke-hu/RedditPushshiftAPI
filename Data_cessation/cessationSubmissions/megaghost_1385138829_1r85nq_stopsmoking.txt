Chantix - Day 6

Background - been smoking since high school, off and on for 17 or so years. I realize now that I've been smoking for over HALF my life, and it is high time to quit for good. I've tried cold turkey, the patch (2x) and now, Chantix. 

Currently, I'm on day 6, and even though I am still smoking as often as I have been (pack+/day), I'm starting to get the benefits of what Chantix is designed to do. I still have a strong urge to smoke (I'm also on Adderall XR 25mg, which makes me want to chain smoke) but I'm no longer receiving any satisfaction from smoking. 

It's an interesting approach, physiologically, that even though the **desire** to smoke remains, the **reward** is decreasing significantly. I imagine by Sunday, when I increase my dosage, (and is subsequently my quit day), I'll have no need to smoke at all. 

It's a weird feeling, though, kind of like falling out of love with someone or losing your passion for something. I know it's not a healthy habit, but I feel like it's also always been a part of my life nonetheless. 

For anyone who is interested, the only side-effects I've experienced so far from Chantix are vivid dreams (which I welcome, as they are not exactly nightmares, but very strange, clear and memorable), constipation and other wonky stomach feelings, and dry mouth. I also feel relatively "absent" at times, it's a very out-of-body sensation, and only has happened when I'm alone. (For example, I was watching Breaking Bad on Netflix last night and I completely forgot that I was at home in my living room. I just felt, I don't know, **not there**.) 

I'm looking forward to quitting, as I'm tired of using it as an excuse and feeling like it defines me in any way. I'll miss having a cigarette outside the bar with my buddies, and I'll miss smoking while driving a lot, too. Other than that, It'll be good to finally get this monkey off my back. 

Thanks for reading. Anyone out there have a good experience quitting with Chantix? Would love to hear some opinions and/or success stories. 

TL;DR - Day 6 of Chantix, quitting after 17 years, ready to be done, how'd it go for you?

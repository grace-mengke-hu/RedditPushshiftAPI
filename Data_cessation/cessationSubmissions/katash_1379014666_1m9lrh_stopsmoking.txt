a HATE a DAY #5

5 days ago, I made a promise to post 1 thing I hate about smoking everyday....day 5

"I'm going to quit."

I HATE telling others that I'm quitting when I know in my heart that I'm not ready. I remember exclaiming to friends and family that I'm finally done!! and this is it and tomorrow will be the beginning of something great!....I would lay in bed and tell myself..."just sleep and when you wake, you'll have gained an 8 hr lead on your quit and it'll be easy"......HAHAHA nope! stay up all night, drive to the store and smoke 2 in a row on the drive home and 1 before falling asleep.
 
When I think about those times I feel like I was only saying those things for attention, maybe it was something to talk about with other smokers. I don't know, but the feelings that I would have about myself after caving in and then seeing those same friends was embarrassing...

When I think of my bond with smoking, it's comparable to being in a relationship with an abusive, selfish partner. I remember feeling a very deadening numbness, an almost empty feeling from not caring or a lack of worthiness every time I went back to smoking, but without it, there was no other way.

after quitting again, I've learned something this time. There's two things in life you can have, reasons or results (and reasons don't count).

DAMN!!! I HATE SMOKING!!

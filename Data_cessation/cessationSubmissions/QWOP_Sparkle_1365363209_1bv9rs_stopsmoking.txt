Checking in. Been stressful at University and stuff.

Not sure if anybody here remembers the huge rant I had in a text post and [nearly caved in](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/1a5ybn/today_has_been_the_most_stressful_day_since/), but I managed to avoid temptation and here I am at 53 days cigarette free!

I've been avoiding this subreddit, as I felt like I needed to for a while, just whilst I was organising all my work and such together. So yeah, please forgive me :(

But I'm back for a couple of weeks, happy to give advice and such to anybody who needs it :)

I've hardly felt any cravings in all honesty, hasn't even been on my mind unless someone has made a passing comment.

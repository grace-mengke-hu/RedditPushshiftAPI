Some Reflections on Day 60

I started this journey of mine 60 days ago and one thing stands out to be very clear to me. One cannot start smoking cigarettes and simply throw them out of their life without constant vigilance. Initially, I thought that it was easy to quit, perhaps this is because I had only smoked for about a year (3-10 cigarettes per day). 

As I've come to find, the tricks your brain plays on you never really stop. The excuses you are capable of subconsciously inserting into your own brain are malicious and sneaky. By this point, it's not merely the addiction for nicotine itself, but the whole aura surrounding smoking. Watching to smoke come off of it, seeing the ember burn bright with every puff, even liking the idea that I was damaging my body for some pursuit of a "fuck it" lifestyle. 

 All in all, I feel excellent as a result of quitting and I want to remove this habit from my life completely. For me, however, it hasn't gotten easier OR more difficult; my addiction has simply just changed. Every day requires new adjustment!

Hopefully this all made sense to you guys! Godspeed.

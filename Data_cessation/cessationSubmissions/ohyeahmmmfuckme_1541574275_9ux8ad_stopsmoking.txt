Why was he being so mean?

So this guy I have been friends with for seven months texted me at 9:30 this morning. He asked me for a ride and I was sleeping when he texted me and it woke me up. I went to his house 5 mins away and he got in my car. He was like "you look fucked up. You okay?" I told him I just woke up and he replied "oh that's why you look like that." I said "thanks" and then he said "I didn't say you looked bad." 

What did he mean by that?

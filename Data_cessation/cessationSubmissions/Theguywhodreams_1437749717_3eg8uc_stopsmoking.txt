Alright denizens of StopSmoking, I need help

I've been smoking now for almost 12 years, 1+ pack a day. Started when I was 19, thought I could control it, but little by little it seized control of me. 

I've quit before, but it seems like every time that I'm successful my life collapses. Here's some of my attempts and how I've failed:

* Cold turkey- Did this when my wife got pregnant for the first time. Went 4 months and failed when my wife lost the child. 

* Chantix 1st attempt- Lasted a good 6 months on this, finances are what caused me to fail this time, which is kind of ironic me starting again because of financial stress when this addiction is a huge financial burden in and of itself. 

* Hypnosis- Went for another 6 months. I eventually made the decision to go back to smoking because I would get day 1 style mood swings for the entirety of that 6 months. 

* Chantix 2nd attempt- Worked great went for 6 months again, but I started again when I was laid off. 

* Chantix 3rd attempt- This was last year. In the span of 1 month I abruptly lost my father and my wife told me that she was leaving me. I actually the battle that time on my father's birthday. After my wife actually left I went up to 3-4 packs a day. Didn't eat much and dropped 55 lbs in 2 months. 

I'm ready to try this again. I recently started biking to work and I notice how I'm unable to oxygenate my body properly. I also notice the ~$150 each month is costs me to service this addiction. But I kind of feel at a loss here. I've tried everything and I just don't know what to do or how to go about it. I guess I could try chantix again, but I really don't want to make a Dr's appointment and have to wait all that time. I'm so tired of my throat being sore, wheezing all the time, scared to sneeze because of all the gunk in my throat, going to the damn store to get cigarettes EVERY DAY. I'm so sick of it all and I don't know where to begin...

I was hoping that someone here may be able to suggest something I haven't tried before. I appreciate any help you guys have to offer. Thanks. 

After writing all this I again feel the urge to go out sate my addiction...dammit. 

Edit: I should probably note that I get free prescription smoking cessation things through my insurance.

Changing Habits

Howdy Folks, 
    After 7 years of smoking, I quit two weeks ago with the help of Allen Carr's book. It hasn't been "easy," but I know I'll never smoke again. 
    Over the last week or so, I've become very aware of how my habits revolved around smoking. It was one of the things I "did", so to speak. I've noticed this because I've recently found myself not knowing what to do or what I want to do &, as a result, spacing-out completely motionless for extended periods of time. I don't think this is a craving or withdrawal issue, but just a matter of having to fill time that was previously filled with slowly killing myself. I'm sure that eventually I'll develop new habits, but I'm just curious what other's experiences were/have been with this, because after sitting completely still for half an hour, you start to ponder your sanity. 
    To be clear, I'm asking, "how did your habits evolve from being those of a smoker to those of a non-smoker? What did that process involve for you? Did you too space-out for far longer than seems natural because you were totally awe-struck by all your newfound time?
    Thanks!

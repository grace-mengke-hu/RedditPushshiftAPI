6 weeks in and my anxiety has finally abated.

I'm not sure if it was an underlying issue masked by the smoking or not but after quitting I experienced pretty severe anxiety when faced with doing anything other than lounging about my house or going to work.

Going out for dinner with friends was impossible as I'd immediately feel nauseous and light headed.

Last weekend I went guitar shopping (pretty much my favourite thing) and I ended up pacing the shop feeling I could pass out at any moment.

The whole experience made me even more determined to quit as I was disgusted that I could have such a reaction from withdrawing from cigarettes. 

I battled it head on and forced myself to get out and put myself in situations I wasn't entirely comfortable in and each time I got a little more comfortable and my pre-nerves got less and less severe.

This weekend I managed going out three times with barely a wobble and my confidence has skyrocketed.

I leave for holiday in Hong Kong / Japan on Saturday and I'm finally convinced I won't ruin it for my girlfriend by wanting to hide away the whole time.

The whole time, it was comforting to remember that everything will pass. The cravings, the anxiety...they wouldn't last forever. If you're having a tough time, just remember that regardless of how bad you're feeling, that feeling will pass. 

Good luck everybody!

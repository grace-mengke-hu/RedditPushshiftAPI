Minor victory: I went to a concert and didn't smoke :)

So far, quitting hasn't been too horrible for me. A few close calls, but I think the fact that I only smoked twice a day max helped a lot. 

I went to a concert this week and was trying to meet the band. I hung out by the tour bus and talked to the crew, all of who were smoking. My first thought was "cool, easy ice breaker! I'll just bum a smoke and start talking". 

Instead, I walked around the building (not gonna lie, I had a shot. Liquid courage over smoking any day!), came back and just struck up a conversation with them. Wasn't long before the band came out and I got to talk to them NOT smelling like an ash tray. 

At first, it was no big deal to me. Looking back, I can honestly say I am glad I didn't pick up just because I was too scared to talk to people.

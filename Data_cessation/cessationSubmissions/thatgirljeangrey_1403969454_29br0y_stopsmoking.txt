Severe anxiety?

I'm on day 7 of quitting-- the first five days were pretty easy, no cravings, coughing up a little phlegm.  Then yesterday rolled around and I got really anxious and paranoid. And I knew it wasn't rational paranoia or justified panic attacks, but they wouldn't go away just because I knew they were irrational.  

I had to call my doc for meds (ativan) because I couldn't calm down, and that's better today but the cravings have kicked in. The cravings I can work through, keep busy and clean or something, but the anxiety.  Holy shit.  No one warned me about this side-effect of quitting!

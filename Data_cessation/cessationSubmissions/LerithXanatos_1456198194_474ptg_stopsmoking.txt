When does addiction really start?

I get cravings when I wake up, but I don't think it affects my mood. If I'm too busy in the morning I'll skip it. It's been maybe a year? I stopped for several months because I didn't have the interest (step one lol). But I tried a new pack that I love (light + menthol) and I'm a little worried about addiction hurting my mental health. 

I also use it for anxiety and stress, and I know how strong dependency can get. 

What I want to do is stop before I get too deep in...which I know is now, but it's amazing for jump-starting myself into action and out of bad thought loops.

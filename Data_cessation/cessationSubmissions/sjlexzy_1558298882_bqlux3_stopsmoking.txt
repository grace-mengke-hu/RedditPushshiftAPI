Tough times...

So the past 48 hours have been rough... my dad has been ill for a long time but has taken a turn for the worse... I’ve barely stopped crying... but somehow I’ve still not smoked... I’ve come close, but know it’s not going to change the situation... he’s hoping I can continue to remember this....

Anyone get wired after quitting?

So Iâ€™m 3 days smoke free. 3 days and 2 hours to be exact! ðŸ˜œ Anyway, I know insomnia comes after quitting (which Iâ€™m having), but I have been wired the past couple of days. Like an abundance of energy and good moods. My bf thinks Iâ€™m a little crazy. LOL. Is this normal?!? Has anyone else experienced this?

Small Achievement and some Serious Worries

I’m 24 and I started smoking 17. I used to be a half a pack a day smoker but I quit cold turkey about three weeks back which I’m super proud of!

Something a little worrying is happening and although the doctor isn’t too worried I want to hear from you all about your experience. About a week ago I got a horrible cough and sometimes I’d cough up some flecks of blood. A week later it’s still happening. The doctor told me not to worry (easier said than done), said it’s fairly normal for a quitter and wrote me a puffer. Did anyone else have a similar experience? It’d really help me calm down my nerves hearing everyone else’s experience!!!

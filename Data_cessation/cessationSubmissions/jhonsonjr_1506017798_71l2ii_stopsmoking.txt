Quit like a genius this Stoptober!!

Stoptober is such an awesome idea, loads of my friends quit last October as they went smoke-free for 28 days and have never looked back since!! Has anyone else tried Stoptober? How did you find it? They have a super helpful app and email support which I thought may be useful to share! Check it out and let me know if it is useful https://www.quitgenius.com/stoptober/

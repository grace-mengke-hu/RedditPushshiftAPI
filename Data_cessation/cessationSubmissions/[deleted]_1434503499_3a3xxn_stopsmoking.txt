Day 40, w00t w00t.

After 10 years of a pack a day, I finally feel like I'm not a smoker. I also moved over these 40 days so it's like I left that old me behind. 

I would say after you hit 3 weeks, it's easy as pie, I maybe think about it one every other day for a quick second. It's typically like:

"I just ate dinner I haven't had one in a while, one would be ok...ugh but I'd have to reset my clock, maybe in a year."

 I'm already starting to see major benefits in my skin and energy. 

My previous high was day 13. Honestly I haven't even come close to craving in a while. 

Literally anyone can do it, and it isn't that hard.

how long will i feel like absolute crap if i quit cold turkey

i feel like such a junkie, i just rummaged through the trash for old juul pods because i couldn't handle the withdrawals. I already have mental health issues, and picked up smoking as an alternative to self-harm. It almost feels like i can't live without nicotine. pretty soon i'll be out completely so i don't have much choice but to quit cold turkey because im currently unemployed and my family refuses to buy me anything else to feed my addiction. I'm more worried that it will spike my depression terribly than the withdrawals themselves.

Food tastes way too much

I'm nearly at 72 hours without smoking cigarettes (around a pack a day) and I'm noticing some strange things. Salty food tastes like I'm drinking cupfuls of water out of the ocean. Chocolate tastes like sugar dipped in honey wrapped in cotton candy. I also became extremely flushed after eating some garlic hummus today. I've never had that happen before with garlic although I've read that it helps improve blood pressure. That was very strange.

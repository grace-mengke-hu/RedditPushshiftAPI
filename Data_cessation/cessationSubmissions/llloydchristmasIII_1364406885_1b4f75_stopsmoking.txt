Some commercial just scared the shit out of me

I know that was the point of it:

But Ive been a smoker for 10 years, a pack day at the worst, and I'm quitting now. I'm 30 years old and I'm done. Kinda scaered because I've tried this a million times before and failed (I think my wife has given up on me and resigned herself to me being a lifelong smoker, sadly) but this time will be different. It has to be.

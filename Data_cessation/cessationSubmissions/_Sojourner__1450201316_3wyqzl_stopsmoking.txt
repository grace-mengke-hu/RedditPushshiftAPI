Camping to quit

Sorry, I'm new to reddit and no good at titles lol.  This Thursday is my last day.  I have work and some social events I have to make it through on Friday, but Saturday-Sunday I'm going camping to shiver out the remainder of the ever-so-advertised "72 hours" of shedding physical dependency.  I've tried several times over the last nine years to quit, with almost no success.  I know there are smokers here who have a lot longer tenure, but I don't want to make it to my thirtieth/ten years smoking.  Whatever I get from smoking, it's just not worth it.

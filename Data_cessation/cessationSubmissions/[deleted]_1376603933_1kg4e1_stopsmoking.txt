Have to quite smoking. I want to kill a kitten. This is not going well.

A cute kitten with furry little white...fur. I can't even think straight. Someone recommended this place. I have to have surgery in two weeks. It's pretty serious surgery and my doctor has said I will have a much harder time with the healing process if I don't stop smoking now. God bless a monkey's uncle! Is it normal to just want to start throwing out profanity and never stop? I'm surprisingly angry right now. 

The thing is, I really want to quit anyway. I have for a while now. I've got a good job, own my own home, just bought a new car, am at the top of the pecking order at work -- why can't I do this stupid little thing? I hate the way it smells, I hate how expensive it is, I hate it and everything about it. It makes dating more difficult than it needs to be, always having to worry if the guy is one of *those* guys who hates smokers. It makes pretty much everything harder than it needs to be and I'm tired of coughing up a lung when I work out and why am I even working out if I'm just going to throw smoke in there on top of it? 

OMG. I might be having some sort of a breakdown. It gets better, right? What works? Rage sex? Will that help? Crosswords? Fuck that, I can't ever make the words fit in the boxes. Knitting? Forget it then. I don't know how. I can learn! Learning to knit is still an activity. But I hate knitting. Stop trying to convince me to KNIT!!!!

I'm going to go run around the yard 15 times in a circle and see what happens.

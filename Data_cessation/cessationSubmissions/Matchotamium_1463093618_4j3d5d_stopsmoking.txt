Quitting nicotine vs quitting smoking

Hey all, I'm very new to this community. I'm 3 days without a cigarette but have been using a vaporizer for my nicotine consumption. I eventually plan to quit that as well but am just trying to get cigarettes out of the way for now.

I just has a question on people who quit cigarettes using supplements like lozenges, gum or vapes. How hard was it to quit nicotine compared to quitting cigarettes? I know nicotine is the real addictive chemical but was just curious what peoples experiences were.

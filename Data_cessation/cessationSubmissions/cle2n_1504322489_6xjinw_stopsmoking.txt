2 months in, and it hasn't gotten much easier. Help?

Sure, it's a bit easier than it was those first two weeks... but it's still REALLY fucking difficult, every single day. By the time I get off work I'm usually pissed off and just want to smoke something (I used to smoke about 10 cigs and 4 spliffs a day, have quit both and replaced with running every other day).

I've made it through today by distracting myself with music and games, but now I'm just sitting here twiddling my thumbs trying to pass the time till I need to go to sleep (partially why I'm writing this all out), but all I can think about is how much I want a cig or a spliff to cap the night off.

Don't know how much longer I can keep doing this tbh. I miss it, a lot. Anxiety and depression are starting to get the best of me, and I'm slowly losing my conviction. Any words of wisdom?

Thanks in advance, sorry if this is discouraging to read. It's different for everyone, and I feel like maybe I'm not ready to fully quit... Though 2 months is the best I've ever done and I'd hate to throw that progress away.

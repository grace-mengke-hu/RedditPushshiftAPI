Hour 18

Hello, im a 22 male whose decided to quit vaping. This is the longest I've ever gone. I've only smoked 3-6mg of nicotine. I have never gone this long in the last 18 months. I feel super exhausted and drained mentally. The craving is there and I want to relapse more than ever. I choose to quit for 30 days to see if I saw any health changes. I hope I can make it through this.

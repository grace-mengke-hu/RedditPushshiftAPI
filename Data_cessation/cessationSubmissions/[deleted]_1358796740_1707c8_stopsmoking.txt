Day one.. Again

Last night I had my last cig around 2am.  As I'm typing this right now I'm want a cigarette. I've been unemployed for almost a year now and I just started going back to school.  I dumped the girl of my dreams because I got stupid commitment issues and I've been trying to get back with her.  We were making progress and I was hoping to go out with her on a afternoon date.  She never responded and its been 2 weeks.  In this two week period I decided to quit smoking and get healthier.  I've tried every single day but by the end of the day I find my self buying a fucking pack.  I've been a smoker for 13 years now. The withdrawals are bad. It's hard for me to work out because I want to smoke instead. Reddit I'm asking for support. Any tips on fighting the craving.. Fighting these withdrawals.  It's only been 14 hours since my last square but it feels like months.  I apologise I'm typing this rant from my phone.  Thanks reddit.

Smoking only starts to win when I do not honor my need for downtime.

Smoking only starts to win when I do not honor my need for downtime.

I have some practices that I try to follow to stop working and relax:
- Take time for exercise, an hour every other evening.
- Drink tea at night. Take a bath sometimes.
- Go to bed at 10 pm, read a bit, listen to music.
- On Sundays, do not start the computer. Take Sunday off the computer. Do yard work. Take a walk with my wife. Play with my dog.

If I fail to honor those practices, the stress catches up with me, and I become far more susceptible to smoking. I feel the demand for smoking increase day by day. 

I must honor the practices to relax. It keeps me happy. It keeps me whole. It keeps me free from addiction.

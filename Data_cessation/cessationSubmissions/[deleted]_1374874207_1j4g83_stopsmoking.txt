Give me some reasons to stop

Going to be drinking tonight.  I would like every person that reads this post to just put 1 reason why not to smoke or to quit in general.  I would like to see a different reason from every person, don't use generalities like "health."  Thanks for the support guys. Hopefully this will help everyone through the weekend!

Any advice for helping with a side effect

So I've been feeling really good most of the time, smell, taste, breathing all improving, cravings are subsiding, and I'm sure quitting is going to stick this time.

But first thing in the morning I keep getting that heavy lung feeling and can't stop coughing, taking a shower or drinking some water helps a little and it goes away as I go about my day. I was thinking of seeing if the doctor had anything that could help speed up clearing out of the lungs or maybe an inhaler to help me breathe when it hits.  Didn't know if anyone has gone that route and what they were prescribed or told.  I'm not about to start smoking again to get rid of it.  (past me may have, but I've quit, I'm not *trying* to quit this time)

Ex-smokers on Adderall quick question.

Hi, I was wondering if anyone who has quit smoking while simultaneously taking Adderall has had severe nicotine cravings. 

I know normal nicotine cravings last a few minutes, but nicotine cravings while on Adderall are persistent and extremely intense. 

I was wondering if there will be a point in time that Adderall will not cause these intense cravings?

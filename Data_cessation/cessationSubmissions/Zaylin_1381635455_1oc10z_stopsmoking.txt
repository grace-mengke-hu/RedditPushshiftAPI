First day 100% Nicotine free, no gum, no patches, but The Easy Way tells me to smoke while reading the book?

Hello all, first post on this subreddit. I made the decision to quit a few days ago, bought a box of nicotine patches and the first day went by pretty smooth. Today however, I decided to try and go through the day without any sort of nicotine at all, patches, gum or otherwise. Because I figure I'm going to have to give up nicotine completely, the sooner I get it done the sooner it's out of my system.

I got some cravings during the day and found the subreddit, and seen everyone recommending this book, so I pick it up and start reading it whenever I get a craving. Well, eventually I get to a point in the book that tells me to continue smoking WHILE reading it. This seems a bit contradictory to what I'm trying to do here.

But it says in the book to follow all instructions, soo, what should I do?

Worst day(s) so far... might actually have one.

So yesterday I had a huge falling out with Mrs diamondjo and ever since then I have wanted a cigarette more than anything else and at more than any other time since quitting a month ago.

I hopped in the car last night to go and buy another pack and got halfway down the driveway before deciding against it an re-parking. I remember going to sleep last night and thinking, yep, I'll buy a pack on the way to work and smoke one in the car. Thankfully I left late this morning so didn't have time. 

And now I'm sitting here, brain screaming for a cigarette, unable to work or to focus. Looking downstairs there are always a bunch of people on smoke breaks and it's all I can do not to go down there and bum one off one of them.

I'm absolutely miserable.

Edit:
AGGHHHH, I feel like a god damned junky. Just went for a walk past the news agent. Hovered around the door but did not go in. Walked up the street having a fight inside my head, one side gasping for a cigarette, the other checking my app to see how many days and hours it had been and thinking that, despite my intention to allow myself the *odd* one at some time in the future, that time is not now. Walked past that bloody news agency 3 times.

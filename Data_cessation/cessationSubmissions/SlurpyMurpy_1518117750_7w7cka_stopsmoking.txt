Day two a non-smoker

Hey everyone, thanks for the massive encouragement yesterday. I made it through the day without a single smoke! 

Although to be honest I feel like I cheated a bit because I just so happen to be coming down with a slight cold and so smoking is the last thing I want to do. But hey, I'll take any extra help I can get here at the beginning!

I feel strong as fuck having gotten through an entire day. That hasn't happened in a long long time. 

So now it's 11:16am on day two and the only thought of a cigarette was when I walked by an ash tray full of them and though "heh, losers". Whenever I'm trying to quit I always pump myself up by looking at cigarettes lying around on the street and people smoking and thinking "Boy, look at these people. No strength. No discipline. Unlike ME who has been not a loser for a full 24 hours now. Yeah, that's right. BIG MAN ON CAMPUS". It's totally bullshit but it's fun to think about. 

I also create a narrative in my head where there is a version of me living inside my head who wants me dead, and he looks like me but his hair is wild and he's covering in dirt and shit and he's always running around screaming and hollering and stabbing rabbits with a wooden spear. And this guy is the one who wants to smoke, and anytime I was smoking in the past it was because he was STRONG enough to kick my ass and take over the steering wheel and light that cigarette.

So now whenever I get an urge I can see him in my head running around screaming his head off, trying to take the wheel, but I just KICK him in the chest and STAB him in the leg and go LILILILILILILILI!!! I AM VICTORIOUS! YOU CAN NOT DEFEAT ME! MEASLY LITTLE CAVEMAN! I AM THE ONE WITH THE BRAIN, YOU FOOL!

It helps. I'll check in tonight with all of you to report of my SMASHING SUCCESS. 

If you're reading this and you haven't quit, don't let that hairy little neanderthal in your brain kick your ass. STAB HIM IN THE FACE!

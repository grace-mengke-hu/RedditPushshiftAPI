Got my star! Early Christmas present to myself but it's time to say goodbye to r/smoking

More like a see you later.  When I quit, I used this sub religiously.  I love going on every time and seeing my badge number go up.  Im amazed by the support and motivation from you guys.  I feel like its time to say goodbye to a device that helped me through the cravings which is this r/stopsmoking.  I really feel like I'm over cigarettes now and don't need to check in daily anymore.  I will check in during my milestones however to update and hopefully inspire.  So Happy Holidays and New Years everyone!

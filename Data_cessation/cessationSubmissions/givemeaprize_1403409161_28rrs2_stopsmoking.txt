7 Days, No Smokes.

On and off cigarette and hookah smoker here, for 6 years. It has been 7 days since I stopped. I have been sick all week with lots of coughing and ugly stuff coming out, but I'm glad I did this, for myself, my future, and my career. It's amazing to see how much poison/garbage I was putting into my body all this time. 

If there's anyone out there trying to quit or stay quit, one thing that's making it easier for me is cardio (i.e. running, biking, swimming, rowing, etc.). Get in 20-30 minutes of this 3 times a week or more, and it really helps!

Giving up the dirty habit.

I decided after hiding my smoking from my boyfriend's niece that it isn't worth it. I grew up as the daughter of a 2-3 pack a day smoker who vowed I would never be like my father.   
After going through a pretty dark rough patch, I picked it up as a form of really relaxing self harm. I felt like smoking was a way to wear how I was feeling on my sleeve and punish myself.   
 
  
Today is the first day in 2 years that I haven't had my lunch smoke break. I threw my half-full pack in the trash and I'm not looking back!

75 Days..

Two weeks ago the person i thought was my soulmate broke my heart. I'm 33 years old and I'm back to square one. 

But this person did something familiar to me at this point- and my therapist hit the nail on the head with it- he forced me to finally draw a line.  For myself.  One that was the absolute limit for ME and my well-being even with so many conflicting emotions, so much confusion, and so much attachment in my heart..

I've heard this comparison on this wonderful subreddit before, but now I'm experiencing it firsthand.  Quitting smoking..I finally drew the line. And stuck with it.  And now I must do the same here with a person that I could've loved until the end of his days..but I couldn't MAKE him love me back.  It was very bad for me.  And although my heart is in pieces, still, so much worse than quitting smoking- just like smoking, i know this illusion will pass.  And it is an illusion! "I loved smoking."  I smoked nonstop for 18 years! I look sometimes at smokers now and am amazed at their self control.  When I smoked I did it constantly and everywhere, including in my home and out to dinner. And it was all an illusion of my mind.  Anyway, sorry if this post is completely weird but i just feel its relevant for some of us who may find that by beginning to love yourself enough to draw a line somewhere and stick with it ripples outward into many other areas of life.  

Also I'm just so happy that in light if all thats happened in my life recently, I'm still a strong happy non-smoker and no one can take that from me.  

Love me.

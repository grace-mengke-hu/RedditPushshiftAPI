I fell back, I need help

I decided to stop smoking cigarettes beginning this May. It was going fine until I broke last night on May 10. I think what's worse was I disappointed myself, I quit smoking weed like it was nothing, but cigarettes keeps calling me and it drove me insane. How do you do it? How do you keep your mind off that craving?

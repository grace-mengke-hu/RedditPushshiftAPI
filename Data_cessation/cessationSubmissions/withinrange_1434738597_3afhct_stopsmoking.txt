F#%<$@?! downward dog NOT WORKING grmxflpxdsff

I am SO pissed today; just overwhelmed. I kind of don't even think it's about not smoking. Just not quite sure how to block/field all the work overload and emails, expectations, etc.

Can't just say to everyone, "Listen: I'm in the middle of quitting smoking, still -- would you please just GO TO HELL right now."

Mostly because if they DID go to Hell, THAT IS EXACTLY where I'M at. !!!

You people all are AWESOME. I did not hit any trees with golf clubs, I did not tell anyone off, I did not break my quit -- THANK YOU for excellent advice and support. Emergency Venezuelan Poodle Moth might be my new totem animal. For sure, days like this point up the fact that I am seriously lacking reasonable adult coping mechanisms -- something to work on, and in the meantime, I'm grateful for your responses. It helps to have live living feedback when my logic is out the window. Will be SO GLAD when these all-day cringings go away. !!

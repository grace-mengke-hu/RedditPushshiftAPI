Drunk trying not to smoke

Guys, I'm currently hanging out with a few friends at my buddys place, we're playing a card game and drinking. I quit on new years, but about a month beforehand I had only been smoking when drunk. I chose to stop this when the new year comes. I'm kind of craving a cigarette, but I think/hope I'll be able to handle it.

 Sorry for mistakes, I have been drinking. 

Wish me luck!


Edit: mistakes I hope

What do nicotine withdrawals feel like?

I am a new nonsmoker. Reading Allen Carr's Easy Way book, a very helpful tip was to pay attention to the ACTUAL, PHYSICAL sensation of nicotine withdrawals. Noticing what I was actually feeling really helped me get through the pangs. It's such an odd, subtle sensation. I need help describing it.

How would you describe the pangs of nicotine withdrawal? Where do you feel it? What does it feel like?

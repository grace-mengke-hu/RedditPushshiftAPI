10 months ago...

I bet you thought I was going to say I quit smoking, but instead it is how long since I joined reddit because of this sub... I have yet to stop smoking. I have one left and today is the day it all comes to an end. I can not keep slowly killing myself. I am stronger than my addiction and it will no longer control me. So today starts the new chapter of my extended life. Gladly accepting positive encouragement and uplifting thoughts. 
Today, we hump life into submission.

Benefits of quitting, which still apply while switching to a vape?

We all know the charts. After 2 hours you heart rate returns to normal, after 1 week sense of smell gets better ect. (totally didn't look that up, likely wrong :P)
Do most of these things still happen if you are vaping? The one I am particularly interested in is the cilia, do they grow back when vaping?
Apologies if I am not making the best sense, it's day one and my mind feels lost in the fog :/

Everything is so much better since I've quit smoking, but...

Since I've quit smoking, I feel so much better than I ever did when I was a smoker. My health skyrocketed and I'm not tired all the time like before, which is awesome. But every day, usually when I'm about to go to bed (like right now), I am thinking about smoking a lot and I get a feeling like something is missing. I don't have temptation or anything like that, maybe I'm nostalgic or something, I don't know. It's just that all this thinking about smoking, when I don't even have desire to smoke, irritate me because it feels like thinking about it is never going to stop and it's very exhausting sometimes. Since I've quit not a day goes by that I don't think about it at least for 5 minutes. Are this thoughts ever going to completely stop, so I can get some peace of mind?

Will I make it?

Hello, free people, and redditors I soon hope I can join!

I recently started Alan Carr's EASYWAY. I started it on my own, nobody adviced me or anything, just saw a redditor's post about it and decided to give it a go. 

I have 20 pages left, I agree with everything so far and still I think I will not be able to make it. Although everybody says I should finish the book before making conclusions, here's why I think I will fail:

Every single person in my surroundings is a smoker. My friends, my SO, my parents. 

I have a smoke buddy at work (she calls me when she goes smoking and we talk about stuff we find interesting, often the ony time I get to chat with her) , and pretty often a smoke is my pause from work, my break.

My parents, when I am busy working from home come into my room and say "Hey give yourself 10 minutes, come smoke a cig"
and as twisted as it may seem it's my 'quality time' with them. (Disguisting I know)

Anyway. The good news is that until now, I have never eever considered quitting, because "I enjoyed it", or "When I get pregnant I will stop" and many more exuses. Reading the book, however and coming here makes me really want to FREE MYSELF from the nasty grip of the nicotine monster, but I don't want to become enstranged to people, especially those, whose company  I found only while sharing a cigarette.

Last, but not least I want to say, I admire you guys a bunch! I can't wait to get my badge and join you, for a lifetime I hope!

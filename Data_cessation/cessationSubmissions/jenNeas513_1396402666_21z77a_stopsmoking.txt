Almost done with day two. It was a frustrating day, but I'm seeing my cravings for what they are, and not letting them get the better of me.

I have a doctor's appointment on Thursday because I have sores on the back of my throat. Cross your fingers for me guys. I'm quitting for my health, and my finances, and to be a good example for my daughter. I want to see her grow up. It's hard to quit, but it would be exponentially harder to have to say goodbye too soon.

Coming off Nicoderm patch?

I am on the last week of the 8 week cycle, on 'Step 3' of Nicoderm. Has anyone else used the Nicoderm patch system - and what is the transition off of the patch like? Is there any way I can prepare? Every time I've started a new step I have just a horrible time the first 3-4 days on that step and I am feeling nervous about this final segment.

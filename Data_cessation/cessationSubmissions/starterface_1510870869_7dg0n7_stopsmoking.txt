7 days done. Today I called a number I found online to ask about my withdrawal symptoms.

I've had a lot of withdrawal symptoms that I expected and, yes, they have been extremely uncomfortable (but no match for my resolve) - however, I did not expect to feel this LAZY or UNMOTIVATED. I was Googling to see if this was a normal symptom of withdrawal and found the US number below to call for advice. I had a lovely conversation with someone who assured me that given how long and how much i had been smoking, the lazy/unmotivated feeling was not unusual. She also gave me a pat on the back for the progress I have made and that made me feel good :)

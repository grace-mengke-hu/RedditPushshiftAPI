Advice to those who smoke weed.

It may seem obvious but I see too many of my friends who try to stop smoking but continue to smoke spliffs (weed + tobacco) and can never beat the cravings. It's just torture, you're making it almost impossible. If you want to be successful at quitting this horrible drug you need to cut it out completely. It's like an alcoholic doesn't get to say he still enjoys his cola with a bit of whisky on a Saturday with his friends.

First Beer

I’ve was a smoker for 22 years and today is my second week of escaping the habit. My old man smokes and today I had a beer with him, I was dreading it to be honest because drinking and smoking went hand in hand for me in the past. Anyways happy to report that not only did I enjoy the beers I didn’t feel like I was gonna die if I didn’t smoke. The conversation was pretty funny,

Old Man” Where’s your smokes are you out, do you want one of these?”

Me “ Na Dad I’ve quit “

Old Man “ Have you? Good work. I’ve felt guilty as hell over the years, blamed myself for you taking it up”

Me “ It’s all good was my choice, anyways they smell like shit now”

Old Man “ Well you’ve always been an arse kisser you should know the smell” 😂

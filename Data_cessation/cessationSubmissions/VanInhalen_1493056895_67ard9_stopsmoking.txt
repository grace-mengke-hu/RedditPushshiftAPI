Welp, after browsing this sub for a while, I'm taking the plunge today.

Hey everybody!
Hope everyone had a fantastic weekend.

I've been a pack a day smoker since I was 19, and I just turned 23 a few weeks ago.

I have tried quitting in the past, never making it longer than a day or two at a time. I'd always find a convenient excuse to light up again.

After reading a fair bit of posts in this sub, I've noticed that a vast majority of you have excellent advice into kicking this habit; and if you don't exactly have great advice, at the very least you're all extremely supportive for your fellow redditor.

I WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE ANY AND ALL ADVICE. It can be something simple to something a little more in depth. Any bit would help.

I hope to come back in a week and give a little update on how the struggle has treated me; good or bad.

I appreciate your time and I hope you all have a great rest of your day.

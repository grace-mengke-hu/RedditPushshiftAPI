Today is not a good day for me....

I guess I just need some kind words ...I feel like I may slip up. This week has not been easy. Especially today. I am super depressed today and just so freaking angry.  I've spent more time working, and worrying about everything I have going on than I have truly been "aware" and present with my husband and daughter.  Shitty week guys...

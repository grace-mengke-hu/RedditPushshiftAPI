Don't know how many times of tried, enough is enough!

Hi guys,

Guess I have a pretty run of the mill story, been smoking for around 14 years now and every time I have tried to stop I have failed.

Until recently when the chest pain has just become unbearable and I feel it constantly. So this attempt is not an attempt at all really, I am confident in it being the final time I stop smoking and take control of my life and health back.

Will post progress until I get to 1 month :)

Update 06/04: Just hit one week smoke free, even went to a bar last night and resisted that shit all the way through.

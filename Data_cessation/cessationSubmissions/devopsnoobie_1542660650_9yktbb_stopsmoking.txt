Doctor is concerned about wheezing in my chest. Now I'm concerned. Thoughts?

Can anyone speak to the likely damage done?


I'm 26, smoking from 18-26. Have quit now for a few weeks. My lung function is definietly getting better but my doctor heads wheezing and he is concerned I have COPD. He wants me to take a chest xray which I'm so terrified of. Its shocking to think i need one at 26.


Can anyone speak to this with their experiences?


I'm not picking cigs back up but idk, now that I'm distancing myself from this shit, all i can think about is me having cancer or some other terrible damage.

I was smoking about a pack a day from 23-26. Half a pack from 18-23.

Thanks.

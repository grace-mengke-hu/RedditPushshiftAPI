Stopped smoking about 2 weeks ago and i've started coughing up black stuff. Is this normal?

Like the title says I've not been smoking for around 2 weeks. I was used to the cough I had developed but now i've started coughing up black mucus instead of the normal color. Should I be worried or is this my bodies way of cleaning itself up? 

Thanks!

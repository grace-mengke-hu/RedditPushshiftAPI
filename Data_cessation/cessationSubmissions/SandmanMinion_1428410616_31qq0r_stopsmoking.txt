Is it normal to have crazy, vivid dreams after quitting smoking?

Hi guys,

I'm proud to say that it's been seven days for me! Like many, I started smoking at parties when drinking, and it eventually evolved in to a regular habit. That was about six years ago, and I've been smoking between half a pack and a full pack every day since. About one month ago I went through a pretty bad break up and I've since been focused on self-improvement; first starting a regular exercise schedule, and then quitting smoking. 

Overall, I'm quite happy with how I feel and I love the fact that I don't stink like a cigarette anymore. However one disturbing side effect is that I have been having really wild, vivid dreams every night since I quit. The most bizarre dream I had was about a girl with whom I shared one class in university, and who I've since forgotten about completely. Is there a chemical basis for this or am I just going a bit crazy?

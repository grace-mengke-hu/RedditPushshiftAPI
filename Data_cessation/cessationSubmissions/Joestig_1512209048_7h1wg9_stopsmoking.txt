2 weeks!! Woah.

I can't believe that I made it... 2 weeks! I feel like the worst part is over - I don't have nearly as much cravings as I had when I started. Now I just need to continue, and trust me, I will do everything in my power to stick to this change!

Some observations:
- I still have a slight cold, but it's getting better by the day.
- My performance at the gym have already started to increase. Quite massively, I must say. My lungs apparently were a bottleneck.
- I exercise almost every day now. I already did that most days, but I have increased it a bit, both in intensity, duration and frequency. It helps me to get rid of stress and to feel like I am working towards something.
- Unfortunately, I do find myself overeating a lot. Smoking used to be a way to tune town my appetite and now I am paying the price for that. I have to learn to eat healthier. Because I burn a lot of calories, I don't gain as much (or at all), but I would like to eat healthier foods and proportions (losing 10-15 kg would be great - but perhaps I should not make too many changes at once).
- I did quit drinking alcohol. It's not as hard as I thought. Replaced it mostly with Coca Cola Zero. An important reason to quit was that alcohol was perhaps the main factor in relapsing, in addition to stress. So, I figured that I needed to do something about those two factors. In the case of alcohol, it meant it should go.
- I had very few tempting moments. That doesn't mean it was easy, I did have cravings. But little moments that I actually thought that I actually should smoke a cigarette. However, I will not be naive and think that I am cured. I should stay vigilant.

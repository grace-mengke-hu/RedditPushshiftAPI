Just had the most severe craving since I quit cold turkey 10 days ago!

So I quit the old way since in my country (eastern europe with third world standarts) we have very limited alternatives ( unless you're very wealthy).Anyway this is not the first time I quit this way, I've done it 4 years ago after 8 years of smoking.After 4 years smoke free unfortunately I became again addicted, smoked around 6-7 cigs each day for about 3 months.10 days ago I quit, first day were hell, been having painful and frequent cravings till day 5, then suddenly the cravings became a lot less severe, totally bearable and not so frequent. When I reached the first week milestone I felt so proud of myself, cravings still persisted but was easy to deal with and I thought the worst part was over!Turns out I was wrong, a couple of hours earlier started the most severe and powerful craving I ever experienced during those 8 days, just like that....  out of the blue... I can't recall of some kind of trigger or anything, the craving is really lasting a lot, never had a craving lasting for hours nonstop. I thought about ending my pain and lighting a cig as my whole body was shaking just 30 minutes ago, then I decided to put myself together and write here!Pls anyone than experienced this , can anybody tell me when does the cravings become mild and when will the thoughts of how cool and beautiful is the act of lighting a cig just disappear from my brain!I need some support Reddit!
I do apologize for the whiny post, I know I might sound pathetic!

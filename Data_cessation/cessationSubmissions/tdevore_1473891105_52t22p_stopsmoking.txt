Undiagnosed ailment

I've been going through some pain and illness for about a year and a half now. I've had many scans and test from several doctors and they are not finding anything amiss (thank God). I suspect that smoking is causing or contributing to my condition. Obviously quitting is the thing to do. But I'm curious, has anyone else experienced an illness that was undiagnosed but was allieviated when they stopped smoking?

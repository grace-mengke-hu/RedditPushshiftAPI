I'm 511 days no smoking and I want to share with all of you my favorite tricks to beating the first few months. (Everyone feel free to comment tips and advice)

First of all, sorry for not posting here anymore. After a some months of not smoking you really forget that you ever smoked. 

I'm going to put this at the start. So if this is all you read then so be it. Quitting smoking has hands down been the best decision of my life. I would absolutely never trade anything in the world for how I feel now compared to the chained down locked feeling I felt while I was addicted to smoking. Maybe you're taking the first step to quitting, maybe you're a month in, maybe you're a year in. Whatever the case is, you're on this subreddit so I assume you're thinking about bettering your health and life. 

First and foremost I want to talk about the first month of quitting. Or what I called a confusing as shit hell month that I actually enjoyed going through. You'll get cravings, you'll get mad, irritable, anxious, you'll start to smell again, taste again, get strange energy spikes, and maybe even a confidence boosts. 

What helped me the most through the first month is the following.

* Exercise: I started running and lifting. If I was going to save so much time from not smoking why not set some fitness goals? I had so much new energy from not smoking too! I couldn't believe it. Before I was sluggish, depressed, and just bleh. Now I have new confidence and a lot more energy. Here's a before and after picture. This is me late last year. http://i.imgur.com/aVkrFoP.jpg

* Pick up a new hobby: The last bullet was about exercise. You don't need to exercise to quit obviously but that's what helped me. Replace all of that time you'd be smoking with a new hobby. I chose exercise because being a smoker and an exercise/health enthusiast really don't work together. If I wanted to relapse and smoke I would have to give up exercise and my health. Nope, won't happen. 

* /r/stopsmoking: I'm not sure I could have quit without this subreddit. I was commenting, posting, and lurking through this sub every. single. day. Oh something positive changed? I have to tell my stopsmoking friends! Getting some bad cravings? I'll browse this subreddit for encouragement. I owe my happiness to you all. This is such a good support group and I always recommend it to anyone quitting. 

* Stop smoking diary: This one was key during my first week. After that first week I stopped writing in it. But it was still nice to go back through it and remember why I stopped smoking if I ever questioned my motives. I jotted down everything from how hard my cravings were on day 3, who I snapped at on day 4, how clouded my head was on day 5, how my taste and smell was back on day 6, and how damn happy I was to quit smoking on day 7. Be sure to mention the negative feelings from quitting. This helped me remember why I don't want to go through this process again. 

* Goals: I set goals. Guys I'm not lying when I say this. 2014 was the most productive year of my entire life. Quitting smoking gave me the courage to do numerous different things. I quit smoking, then went on to apply for a manager position at my work and I got the job, I started therapy, I've gone back to school this year, I've put on a whole lot of muscle, I've changed my eating habits, I've started going out more, gained new friends, got a girlfriend, etc. Quitting *helped* me gain the confidence to do all of these things. 

* Avoiding cigarettes as best as you can: This method normally causes a few different opinions but it helped me. I stopped seeing my friends that I smoked with for the first month or two. Some people say that's a little harsh, but I know not being in the routine of hanging out, watching a movie, and then pausing the movie and smoking routine helped me quit. Some of you have family or an SO that smokes. So don't let this discourage you. You're just as capable to quit as I am :-) 

* Allen Carl's Easy Way To Stop Smoking: You might have heard of this book a few times around this subreddit. Check it out. It's cheap and worth a shot. 

Like I said before this has been the best decision I have ever made. It's 511 days later and I rarely get any serious cravings. Maybe once a month and it lasts only a minute. And I never fear that it will cause me to start smoking again. It's just a "Huh, I kind of miss that" feeling. Then it's gone. 



**Here's the benefits of quiting  section that I have noticed. I'll be repeating most things that I said in the thread above, but some things will be new.**


* I can smell and taste again

* Clothes no longer stink, which means I no longer stink

* Increase in energy

* I wake up easier

* I've saved $3,000

* Less anxiety 

* No longer talking away from girls so they can't smell my smokey breath

* My dick works better. Yep, I said it. I get much harder much quicker and for much longer

* Everything works better really. I just feel healthier. I can breathe, smell, taste, run, sex. It's a world I haven't seen in years. 

* You can enjoy a life of your own: Have you ever gone out to eat dinner with friends or family but had to leave early because you needed a cigarette? Imagine eating dinner and then chatting with your friends for 30 minutes after you've ate. 

* Confidence now this probably wasn't directly from quitting. I'm not saying quitting smoking offers super powers. But whenever you improve the quality of your life, you might gain a little confidence from it. If anything at all, you no longer smell like an ash tray. 

I could go on for days but your eyes are probably tired if you've read this far. Thank you all so much for the support in the past. This is truly an amazing and supportive subreddit, and I'm so proud of you all for taking the journey with me. 

I ask anyone that needs support or has questions to send me a message.

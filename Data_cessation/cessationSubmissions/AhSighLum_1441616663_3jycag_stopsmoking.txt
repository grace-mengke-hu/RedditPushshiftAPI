Going to try Stoptober! Any advice?

The plan is to not start smoking again after if i manage that month. I imagine that i wouldn't want to start again after making it a whole month anyway. Thought i would get some advice as im in the run up to quitting so i can be a little more prepared for whats to come. I do enjoy smoking yes but being 21 and have smoked since i was about 16 i want to kick this habit now before i become a wheezy middle aged mess haha.

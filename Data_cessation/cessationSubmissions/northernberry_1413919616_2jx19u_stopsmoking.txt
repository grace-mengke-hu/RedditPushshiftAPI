So I'm quitting on Nov 12th and I'm terrified of life without cigarettes

This month I was diagnosed with IC (Interstitial Cystitis) which is chronic inflammation of the bladder, it basically feels like your living with a UTI and my Dr. told me that I must stop smoking if I even want a decent quality of life. I also have severe acid reflux which has ruined my life and I continue to ruin it by smoking. So I plan to quit on Nov 12th which is the day I go in for an IC procedure which might be able to reverse my condition somewhat and I told myself that cigarettes are not an option, especially after a procedure that is supposed to give me relief and smoking cigarettes would just contradict my whole healing process. I've been smoking for about 3 1/2 years, only quitting for about 3 months out of that total time and I'm just terrified of not being able to smoke anymore. So if anyone has some tips on how to make quitting easier then that would be great or even just some words of encouragement :( Thanks everyone!

I started Chantix today.

I've tried going cold turkey, nicotine patches, vaping, and weaning myself off. Every time it's worked for a couple days, a couple weeks, a couple months. But I always come back to cigarettes. It's time to try medication. I hate being a smoker, and I'm ready to be a non smoker.

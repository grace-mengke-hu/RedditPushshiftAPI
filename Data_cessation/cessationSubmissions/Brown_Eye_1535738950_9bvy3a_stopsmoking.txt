Tomorrow is 1 year of ZERO ciggs!

I felt I should share to keep morale and motivation high, so here is my story: 

 I started when I was 12 and smoked till I was 28.  I had a small break when I joined the military and picked it right back up the minute I had the opportunity.  I became a pack a day smoker by the time I was 19 and there was no stopping me.  5 years later I moved to a state where a pack would cost $8 and I still continued to smoke even though it was double the price.  At that point I realized it was hurting me financially and tried to quit, lasted a whole month before I started right back up.

 I have  tried Chantix, Wellbutrin, Patches, Gum, and everything under the sun until I came to this sub.  This sub recommended Allen Carrs book, and boy did that help.  I smoked the entire time reading that book and by the end I was done with ciggs, or so I thought.  I quit for an entire 4 months and the minute I went to Afghanistan I picked it right back up.  This time it was worse, not only was I smoking a pack a day, but I was dipping a half can of Copenhagen along with it.  I knew it was killing me and draining my bank account, but I simply didn't care.  In July of last year I was 28 years old and I woke up one morning coughing up blood.  This happened again a few days later and I decided to consult my doctor as I thought "oh shit I fucking have Lung Cancer or another Lung Disease."  He agreed and said it's very possible, but only tests will determine that.  Luckily the x-rays and blood work came back negative.

I have survived 1 year in Iraq and 4 years in Afghanistan.  I thought to myself "Dying of Lung Cancer after living through all that would be so shitty."  I know that's completely insensitive to those people who have Lung Cancer, but I was making the statement about myself.  I had heard about Vaping, and everyone around me had something negative to say about it.  Things I heard were: "You'll die of Popcorn Lung", "It's worse than ciggs", "Vaping is gay".  Well I'll tell you what, it works!

What worked for me was setting a timeline up and having a plan of action.  Before you do ANYTHING in life you should have a solid plan, and if that plan fails, well you try to make another plan.  If you go into quitting ciggs without a plan of action, you're going to have a bad time and continuously think about ciggs.  My plan was to start at 12mg, and reduce that to 6mg in 2 weeks, and then down to 3 mgs in another 2 weeks, and then eventually down to 0.  I also invested in a solid mod, tank, and quality flavored juice.  A common misconception is "well I love ciggs so I should vape tobacco flavored juice".  Another common thing I hear is "That mod/tank combo costs $100, that's a little ridiculous".  Tell you what smoking a pack a day for 13 days will put you over that $100 mark.

Well I'm happy to say that my plan worked for me.  As soon as I got to the 0 mg mark, I quit vaping all together too.  I installed the Smoke Free app to track how much I was saving and my health improvements as well.  That kept me motivated and was pretty accurate.  I could finally taste things and start breathing better.  One month after quitting I started working out, at this point I was almost 300 lbs of pure fat, today I sit at 260 lbs with way less body fat, can run 2 miles without stopping, can bench over 225, squat over 250, and dead lift around 350 lbs.  I still have a ways to go, but I look and feel much stronger, my body fat percentage has dropped by about 14%.  My skin looks much healthier, for the first time in over a decade my dentist told me my teeth and gums were absolutely perfect.

For those of you wondering, "well what about alcohol?!"  Every time I would quit I would usually end up smoking when I started drinking, after all go to any bar and you'll find smokers outside who will happily share.  Vaping helped keep the need to smoke down especially when I was intoxicated.  2 months after I quit I went to a friends house and he was smoking a cigarette and it smelled absolutely awful to me.  2 months after that I was at a party and a couple walked in and they just wreaked of smoke, and I asked my friends if I smelled like that, and they said "all the time."  I was so embarrassed and disgusted with myself.

For those of you who don't feel like reading my wall of text.  Here is exactly what worked for me:

* Read Allen Carr's book to get my mind right
* Vaped with a plan to reduce nicotine
* Tracked progress with Smoke Free 
* Implemented exercise and diet changes 

I wish all of you the best of luck.  Also fuck the cigarette companies and the asshole politicians who support them.

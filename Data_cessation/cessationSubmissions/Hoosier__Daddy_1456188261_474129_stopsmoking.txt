Hey guys, this is a little odd but I need some advice. I know I should, but I don't want to quit smoking. Only reduce consumption.

It's weird. Its been like 12 hours since my last cigarette and it wasnt a planned quit day or anything. I just decided to see how long I can go. I've tried quitting before and it doesn't work. 

So on to the main issue. I'm a little too young to be going through a pack in a day and a half but thats the case. I realize now I don't want to quit. I want to bring it down to a pack in maybe a week and then quit from there. My body just feels weird right now, I cannot study and I'm just so much more efficient when I'm smoking. 

Either way, I just wanted to know your thoughts and opinions on this. Thank you!

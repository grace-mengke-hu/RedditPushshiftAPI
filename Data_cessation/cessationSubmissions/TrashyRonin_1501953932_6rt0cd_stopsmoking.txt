5 Years!

After smoking my entire life, starting as a young kid, I hit my 5 year free mark.  It *is* possible to quit smoking now matter how addicted one may be. I honestly don't miss it now. I won't gloss over how challenging it was at the beginning, and the absence of nicotine after a life on it has uncovered some depression, etc but it's nothing compared to the mental and physical torture of smoking.  

If you are struggling, stay strong. It's worth it.  Don't look back.

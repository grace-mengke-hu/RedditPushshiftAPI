It's time to quit (for the sake of my hearing, and health of course)

Ok, so I have been smoking on and off for a long time. But always been able to fool myself by telling me it's only when I am drinking, special occassions etc. This is not entirely true as i keep smoking during the week as well. Sure there can be some time between cigarettes but the time inbetween is getting shorter and shorter. 

A big reason for me is actually for me hearing, I have some issues with sound sensitivity and some tinnitus, which i really hope will not get any worse. I had no idea that smoking could affect the hearing.

Wish me luck!

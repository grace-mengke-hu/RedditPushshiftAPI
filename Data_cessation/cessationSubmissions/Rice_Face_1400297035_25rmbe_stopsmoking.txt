Help me decide on a quit date

I smoke on average 15 cigarettes a day and decided to quit but I don't have much motivation besides saving money. I bought nicotine patches recently and started using them 2 days ago. The thing is, I still smoke, but after using the patch, the number of cigarettes I smoke has lowered to about 5 a day. I plan on lowering this number to 0 in 2 weeks time. I'm having seconds thoughts especially about postponing my quit date. I have also read Allen Carrs book and bought an e-cigg. Anyway, I would like to know how you guys said "today's the day" and what other motivation I should keep in mind.

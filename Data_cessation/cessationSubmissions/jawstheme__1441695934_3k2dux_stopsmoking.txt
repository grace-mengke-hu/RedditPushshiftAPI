1 month! not so nervous anymore

I can't believe I have made it this far. I think my biggest challenge is drinking. Anytime I drink, I start to tear up or cry because my cravings become so intense. I've begun to just avoid situations where I would be tempted to drink. Other than that, I think I've done pretty well.

This month has been one of the most difficult months of my life. So i just want to say, whether it's only been one day or one year, stay strong and remind yourself your main reason for quitting. I believe in you!

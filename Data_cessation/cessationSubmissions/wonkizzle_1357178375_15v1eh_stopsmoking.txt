18 hours in, feelin fine.

I quit smoking yesterday, and its about the 3rd time ive tried cold turkey. Im a strong believer in addiction being mostly mental. So my reasons for not quitting sooner are pitiful. This place seems to be full of inspiration and success, so I will be around whenever I get the urge. Wish me luck, new found friends.

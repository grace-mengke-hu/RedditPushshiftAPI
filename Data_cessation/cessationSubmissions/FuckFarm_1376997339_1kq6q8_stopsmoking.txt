Allen Carr's book stopped working...

I read the book a few years ago and quit instantly for a few years.

Then I started occasionally having one or two in order to socialise with smokers. (Eg when a group goes outside)

And then I started again for a few months.

And then I read the book again, and quit for a few months.

And now I'm on and off for a few weeks at a time, and the book has stopped working. I know everything in the book is true, but while I'm smoking my mind deliberately ignores itself and all I've learned from the book.

Going back and re-reading it a dozen times hasn't worked.

So, what now?

I am so incredibly angry that I could have quit 10 years ago and enjoy my 20s much more

Now that I quit it's like I ascended into a whole new dimension I forgot that existed. 

All the anxieties, gone. Eyebags under the eyes gone. Hair are brighter. I walk and move with control and it's like 100kilos have been liften out my shoulders. My performance at work is 10x better, I no longer am letargic and nervous all the time. Depression, gone. The only thing that is left is this horrible feeling of what life could have been if I had quit 10 years ago. I went through my first twenties full of insecurities which had stemmed one year after I started smoking, exactly when I started smoking more. I self handicapped and was unmotivated all the time, I was angry with people all the time. And now it's all so incredibly clear and easy.

Voice is deeper and more powerful without effort. I hear better. Posture is better and extremely easy to walk fast. Women on the streets have started noticing me again. Self haltred and neurotic thoughts from when I was smoking 30 a day with 10 coffees are disappeared

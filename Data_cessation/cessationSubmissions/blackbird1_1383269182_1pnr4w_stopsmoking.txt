Ok. Here we go again.

Re-set my badge. Thanks so much for all the support the last few days guys. It means the world. When I told my mom I caved she said "oh thank God." My husband said - "well did you enjoy it? Then why are you upset?" I don't expect much support out there so it's nice to be able to get it in here. So I'm going to lay it all out. I went to my allergy / asthma doctor today. He requested I come in for an appointment because I had been refilling my inhaler too often. He ran some tests and basically I have the beginnings of COPD. I'm 28 years old. 

Time to make it happen.

Day 6 again

I attempted a quit not that long ago and I was a bit overzealous because it didn't last long. I caved after the mental arguments become more than I was willing to deal with. It's funny how giving in to being a space to nicotine can seem easier than fighting off the cravings. Here I am at Day 6 and my energy is zapped. The insomnia coupled with brain fog is getting on my nerves a bit. I just have to focus on the fact that my body is going through big changes and deep healing. Also, this too shall pass and I will be back to feeling more like a human! Lol.

Seems like I'm getting there

Wow. If someone had told me this time last week that in a week I'd have taken the first steps into quitting I'd have laughed heartily in their face. 

For me it was such a spur of the moment decision to quit that this all feels a bit odd so far. Haven't had any nicotine since Thursday afternoon and so far... I've felt pretty much fine. Which makes me kinda suspicious.

I smoked for about 3 years and was expecting this to be much more of a headache. It's not even like I have a major new motivation in life to spur me on with quitting. 

Has anyone else felt strangely at ease in the early stages of giving up? Does it go downhill a bit after a few days of nicotine detoxing?

[22/M] All my family smokes since I was a kid. I want to quit.

I started smoking at 18 just at parties and weekends and now, without realising, I can easily smoke 15 cigs a day and when I have a week full of tests at my university the whole pack.Today, I was thinking that maybe I don't know the real threats of smoking but I don't know if it is a good idea to stop smoking because of the negative effects... maybe it's better to know that my mind has the power to control myself like when I wanted to start smoking.

Can you guys give me any advice or technique that you use, knowing the fact that I have a smoker family?

Thanks!

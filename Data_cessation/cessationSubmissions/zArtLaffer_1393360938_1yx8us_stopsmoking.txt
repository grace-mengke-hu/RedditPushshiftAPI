Shaking, dizziness and hand-eye coordination

I don't recall it being a problem before, but ever since I quit drinking (which probably screwed me up and I didn't notice, because ... drunk), whenever I have a morning cigarette, and more through the day ... I really get the shakes badly, dizziness, mental un-clarity (fuzziness, poor focus), poor(er) balance and worse coordination. Is that common?

Quitting does not have to be miserable!

I am 23 days into to quitting.  I smoked for 10 years, half a pack to a pack every day.  I had been thinking about quitting for a while.  I got a fever.  My girlfriend had ordered this book a couple weeks before - Alan Carr's EASYWAY to Quit Smoking.  I thought it was horse shit.  BUT after two days of being heavily sedated and not smoking, I decided I would read it. 

Best advice from the book is this:
Every cigarette you smoke is curing you of the withdrawal from the last.  SO smoking is the only way to feel like you are not a smoker.  Once you get this in your head, it is an easier decision everyday.  "If I smoke a cigarette right now, I will have to smoke everyday to feel the way I already do.  That's fucking mental.  

I haven't felt good the whole time, but my mood is in pretty good shape.  Physically, I am coughing a lot.  My body probably needs to get rid of a lot of shit, but I think it's worth it.  

It also helps to tell myself that the "cravings" are just my mind resorting to what it has been trained to do for the past ten years.  I embrace the fact that I am thinking about cigarettes and get pumped that I don't need them.  I literally use my cravings to my advantage.  

Finally, you are not giving anything up.  If you tell yourself that, you will fail, or at least it will be twice as hard.  You are actually living in the place you used to have to smoke to get to.  If anything you have gained more of what you were seeking.

I hope this helps somebody.  READ ALAN CARR'S BOOK.  Seriously.

good luck

bye bye star hello first week

aaaagh.... I just had to reset my badge. I was well on my way to month 2, but I bought a package two weeks ago in a weak -very weak - moment. I regretted the package the moment I lit the first one. It was foul, I was setting myself back a whole month of proud quitting, I was ashamed of myself, I felt stupid. But did I regret it enough to throw away the rest of the package and start quitting anew? Ooooh no, I just waited till my husband was sound asleep to smoke a secret cigarette or two. Or three. Remind you, I am the one who has to get up early to go to work (hubby is retired), so why the heck was I up at 2am in the morning, smoking a filthy cigarette, which costed me not only my star, but also my oh so needed rest? The whole day I  was busy not with work, but with that quiet cigarette in the middle of the night and for what? This lasted till last Saturday and you guessed it: I am back on track now with my 1st week in. But I had to reset my badge. I didn't even check how many days I threw away....I AM BACK ON TRACK AND FEELING GREAT! /rant over

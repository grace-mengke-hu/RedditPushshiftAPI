It Might Be Too Late For My Neighbor, but Not Me. I'm Done.

I met my new neighbor today. She's sweet, elderly, and clearly suffering from Emphysema. She struck up a conversation with me while I was outside smoking, and sure enough she lit up her own cig two sentences into the conversation. 

I will never, for the rest of my life, forget the suckling sounds her lungs made as she took that initial drag. I wanted to wince, I wanted to duck inside, I wanted to hide from the reality slapping me in the face. 

As soon as she left, I hopped in my car and bought nicotine patches. I'd come to realize last week that I don't NEED cigarettes, that I want to quit, that I deserve a full and healthy life. I bought running shoes. I want to be able to run with my dog instead of watching her, wheezing, because I can't catch up. I mean come on, she's a Corgi. Her legs are like two inches long. I should be able to keep up. 

After tonight, I am done. I'm going to smoke the rest of this pack and watch the Allan Carr video many of you lovely people recommend to others. I'm going to mourn for my poor neighbor, but I will no longer mourn for myself. I'm stronger than nicotine. I deserve better than this, and I'm the only thing between myself and success. 

Once I put that patch on, I will no longer be a smoker. I look forward to participating in the sub, hopefully receiving support and offering it in kind. 

Wish me luck! :)

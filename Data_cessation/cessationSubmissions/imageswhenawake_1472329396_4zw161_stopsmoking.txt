Feeling like I've hit some solid ground at 15 days... not complacent though

I relapsed for about 18 months after 8.5 years quit... somehow I got amnesia about how badly smoking takes over your life... weird!

After a number of quit attempts this last year and a half, so far this one is sticking... I failed all the other ones by thinking I could get away with "just one"... Each time, "just one" led to a full-out relapse that lasted months... the entire relapse after 8.5 years happened because I was taking just a few puffs here and there! 

I have to remember I can't handle even a puff... get the day done without a puff, and try to wrap my head around the commitment to never take another puff... which is quite the head game for me at this point, haha

But things are feeling good, various chronic pains have disappeared, there's a healthy vibrant energy I can feel in my skin, energy levels have increased, taste is blooming, and it's nice to not be broke all the time!

I read Allen Carr's Easyway every day, listened to the audiobook each night when I went to bed, and daily have been reading from whyquit.com, trying to fortify my resolve and rewire my brain against smoking...

If you're in the early days, battle it one craving at a time... anybody can get through one craving, if you give it your all... 

Good luck guys and gals in the early days!  Read read read, pray if you believe, hang out here for support!

And thanks to the older people with months and years who encourage us!

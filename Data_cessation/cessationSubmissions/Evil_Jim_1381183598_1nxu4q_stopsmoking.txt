[Request] Tips for not smoking at work...

Any one got any tips for stopping smoking at work?

Don't smoke at home, but work can get all sorts of stressful, and so with the 5 minutes in the morning and afternoon and at lunch, I'm practically screaming for one. 

Need a bit of help with trying to not think that the cigarette is helping or other methods of distraction...

Thought anyone?

Cheers

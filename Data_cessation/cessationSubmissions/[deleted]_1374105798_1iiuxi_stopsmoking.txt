I just got bronchitis for the 4th round in a years time....

And once it turned to pneumonia, I'm so fuckin done with smoking. I'm in the middle of moving 2000 miles across the country solo and I can't go 5 minutes without having a major coughing fit. I hate to say it because I'm very attached to it, it's kind of my little escape throughout the day. Any suggestions on how to escape for a little bit so I don't go stir crazy? I've been a long time lurker here thinking about it, but it's long overdue. I already threw out what hopefully is my last pack!

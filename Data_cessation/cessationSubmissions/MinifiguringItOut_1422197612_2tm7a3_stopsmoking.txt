Checking In

Didn't realize it had been so long.  Yesterday my phone buzzed me to tell me it had been 200 days since my last cigarette.  Large amounts of credit go to this sub.  Keep it up everyone!

The day before I went to a casino (the only place left in Iowa where smoking is legal).  Upon my return home I was frustrated that I smelled.  I feel like I have passed the final tests and can now be a nonsmoker instead of a former smoker.

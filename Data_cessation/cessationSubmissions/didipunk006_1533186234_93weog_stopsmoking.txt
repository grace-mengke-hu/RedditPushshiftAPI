I think I'm up to 8 days now?

It feels a little crazy because my last post was about how I didn't smoke for 70 hours or something like that. Now I'm at 8 days. This is more than a week and I will never use the hour scale again. So what did I learned after one week? Problems can appear at any moment. the first 2 days were fine because I had patches but I never removed them before sleeping and I think this weekend I overdosed on nicotin because of the patches. I threw up 2 times after eating saturday and I was shaking and couldn't move at all. After that I stopped the patches but used the nicotin gums, in the am pm and evening instead. Things are better now. Patches helped at the beginning but now it's me against my cravings. Because yes even after 8 days I still have moments where I can see me smoking a cig and I think it could be a nice experience. So I'm working on this and each time I wanna smoke I go on my balcony and just breath fresh air for 5 minutes before going back inside. I need to reach 2 weeks and start keeping track of weeks instead of days. Wish me luck.

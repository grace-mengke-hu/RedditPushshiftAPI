Keep trying aaaagh

I spend my days reading here.
It's a while I am trying to stop vaping and I keep failing.
After five years of chain vaping also at work, I now have reduced a lot and keep it far from me.
But I can't stop yet.
Too high anxiety.
It's a tough moment for me. Health issues. Scared also by a white thing in the mouth I will need probably a biopsy.
Scared, anxious tired and frustrated.
It's not easy to stop when the mood is already instable for other reasons.
But I really want to.

So nothing, I will keep bothering you here because I need to vent.
I will keep reading all the messages and good stories.

Good luck everyone!

So far so good

I have been smoker for last 5 years. Ofcourse, like all smokers I hated myself for smoking. I have tried to quit smoking 3 or 4 times earlier using chantix. It worked (3-4 months) and I almost got rid of thinking about smoking as a second nature. But I got back into it because of stress triggers.

Now, my life has finally stabilized (divorce and all). Also, smoking is
starting to affect my health. I am serious about quitting smoking this specially knowing how much I am addicted to this poison and also knowing there is no one to take care of me. Today is my 3rd smoke-free day, again using chantix. I have my sister to give me company until thursday but I am afraid after that I would go back to smoking when I feel lonely. Yes, I know, smoking does nothing to get rid of loneliness.

TL;DR Just venting out!

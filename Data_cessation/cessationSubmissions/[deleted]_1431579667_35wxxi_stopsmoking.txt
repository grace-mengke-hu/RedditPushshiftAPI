Just passed my 24hr mark

I've struggled with quitting for awhile, recently said no more but the temptation and availability is all too easy to succumb to, such as when I go to a gas station. 

Been able to avoid buying another pack so far but Anyone got any advice on resisting the temptation to buy another pack?

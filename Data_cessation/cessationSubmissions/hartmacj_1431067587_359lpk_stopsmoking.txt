Need your help for my Grandpa

Hi guys, not sure where else to post this but hopefully I came to the right place! Last Sunday, my Grandpa finally gave up smoking. The doctors told him if he didn't quit he would die within the next year. (Mainly due to issues caused by smoking over the years. Quitting would just give him a chance at a few more years.) According to him he hadn't gone a day without a cig in almost 62 years. This whole week I have been checking up on him and I'm worried. He has barely eaten a thing all week, looks miserable, and is coughing up a lung. I just want to know what can I do for him, to motivate him to keep going? It sucks watching him like this but I know it is for his own good. Also, is there anywhere to keep the coughing too a minimum? We have tried just about every cough syrup, cough drop, etc... Either way, thanks for reading.

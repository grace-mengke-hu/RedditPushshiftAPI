330+ Days and this is what I miss about smoking.

Not a damn thing! 

It really and truly does get easier with time. The longer I haven't smoked the less I miss it. 

I was so stupid to think that no one could smell it on me, you can smell it from a mile away! When you get on an elevator with someone who just smoked, or your in a store and someone walks by you, hell even sitting in my car and if the wind is just right I know someone around me is smoking. Its SO strong! 
The ultimate test however was when I started watching Peaky Blinders, my god do those people make it look good, but I know better. 

And the spare cash, I've been able to update a lot of my furniture, even buy new TV's and update my computer over the last year with the amount I've saved. 

Trust me people, you won't miss it. You've made the best choice you could possibly make by quitting. Hang in there!

Week One Down

Thank you to everyone in this community for your stories and support. I've had many false starts over the years, but I'm going to make it this time. 

From day one, a week seemed like an eternity, but today, being smoke-free feels like the new normal. Yes, I still have cravings, but they are already so diminished from my start date, it's incredible. A couple of days ago, I even went to a bar that allows smoking inside! I was fully prepared to leave if I felt overwhelmed, but it never happened. Instead, I felt proud of myself every time I watched someone light up without asking to bum one. 

Again, I thank each and every one of you. I sincerely could not have made it to the seven day mark without the support, advice, and testimonials I found here. 

Love and light.

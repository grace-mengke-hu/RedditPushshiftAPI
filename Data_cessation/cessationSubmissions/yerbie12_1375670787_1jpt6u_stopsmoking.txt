Mental Health and Qutting

Hey there r/stopsmoking.  So I've made the first step in deciding to quit.  It's been a long time coming, and I know its something I need to do. That being said, I want to get a little bit of advice from everyone here.

My biggest concern about quitting is withdrawal.  I have a history of depression and panic attacks.  Being a therapist myself and having done some research, I know that there is a chance that my symptoms will worsen when I quit.  That being said, I'm absolutely terrified to take the first step and be rid of cigarettes once and for all.  I'm not looking for medical advice, I will be taking care of that in the near future before I quit.  Rather, I was interested to hear if anyone has any similar experience and could provide some advice/stories/words of wisdom, especially from a subreddit I can promise I will be obnoxiously active in as soon as I begin my journey.  I want to be prepared for the worst before I take the step that I know will better my life.

"You can get lung cancer if you don´t smoke, too."

I hear especially "new" and young smokers say this. And it is true. But it is irrelevant. I´ll share a personal story I witnissed first hand.


Two years ago my uncle died from lung cancer at age 54 after being a smoker for 30+ years. Everybody who has been with someone who had cancer may know how hard the months can be from the diagnosis trough the treatment to the result.
He just got a new girlfriend (25~ and really hot) couple of months before his diagnosis. And in his last couple of weeks he told me that he wished he had ten more years and never had started smoking in the first place. I will never forget the look on his face while he said that sentence. 

He worked hard his whole life and spent a lot of money on cigaretts. He might would have gotten cancer anyway. But what he regretted was that he didn´t live up to his full potential and didn´t do anything in his power to prevent it by living a healthy lifestyle.
He might would have had another 30+ years with an awesome beautiful woman if he wouldn´t have picked up on smoking. 

This is the difference quitting or never starting can make.

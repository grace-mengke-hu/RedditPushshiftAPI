Day 4 - 100 hours (feelings)

So I'm coming up on 100 hours. Smoked +/- 13 cigs per day. 

I'm pretty surprised by how this all goes so far. I've read a lot on this sub before quitting last Sunday, but I think everyone experiences it differently I guess. 
Luckily I don't have really severe cravings,I kinda have an itchy kind of craving but I can't scratch. 

I suffered from major concentration problems during the first two days, and I still feel a bit numb. 
I may look depressed but that is not the case. I feel numb, I feel nothing. And I don't mean a depressed kind of nothing, more like a peaceful and sedated kind of nothing. I've trouble describing it. I just want to look out of the window all day and do nothing, no talking, no listening.... Nothing. Like I smoked weed or something. Someone told me that I could be high on oxygen now that I quit smoking.  I did not expect this to happen before I quit.

I have the feeling that my addiction is losing. It is still fighting sometimes, i can feel it. It hangs on for dear life and every craving I can feel it trying to get a grip. But the addiction loses it every craving.

I hope my numbness fades soon, but apart from that I'm very, very proud of myself. Thank you all for your inspiration and stories that got me going!

Day 4 is the hardest so far

I'm on day 4 and the cravings and irritability have been bad today. I haven't given in though so I'm proud of myself. I keep going outside and talking a 5 minute walk every hour (like I used to smoke), I'm sucking away on lollipops and I'm reminding myself how awesome it will be to stop thinking of cigarettes all the time. 

One craving at a time...

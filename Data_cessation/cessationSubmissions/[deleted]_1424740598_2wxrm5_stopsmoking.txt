"I'm on holiday" is not an excuse to start back up

I quit near the end of last year and it felt great.  I even submitted a post here about how the wheezing and coughing at night was causing me to lose sleep and that that was the final straw: "I quit"...Then I went to Sydney over the New Year and after 50+ days of cold turkey,  gave into the urge citing the piss-weak excuse "I'm on holiday." Eventually,  the holiday ended,  the smoking didn't.  It took another 6 weeks for me to stop and,  spurred on by lent,  I've managed a solid week.  

Next time,  I won't give in to that care free holiday mode.  And you shouldn't either.

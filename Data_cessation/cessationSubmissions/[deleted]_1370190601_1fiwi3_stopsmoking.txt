Quitting... Getting Angry.

Okay, 
So basically I am forcing myself to quit smoking. I am looking into a new duplex that is being built and really want to get into it. The thing is, I need the money to do this. My extra money goes to cigarettes each month.
Cigarettes are $11.50 after taxes in my town. So that alone should say to quit. 

But OMFG. I'm on day 2, my hands are shaky as all. I can't keep myself distracted enough. I went for a long walk this morning and took some great photographs of the train station, and town, but as soon as I came home, I wanted a smoke. 

I didn't notice how irritable I was until I saw the stack of dishes in my sink (Which isn't even honestly that much.) And just got SO angry. 

I'm not taking it out on anyone in my life, or snapping at people, but it's boiling under my skin, and giving me bad anxiety. 

I WANT A CIGARETTE. :(

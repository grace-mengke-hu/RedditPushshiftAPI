How is quitting weed compared to quitting smoking tobacco?

I've quit smoking tobacco for almost 2 years now. However I still smoke a lot of weed pure. I'm contemplating about kicking that habit too. I've quit a few times in the past but started again. Somehow I think quitting weed will be harder because it's much more than just a nicotine physical nicotine addiction. Anyone got some experience?

After 8 days, here I am, relapsing

So yeah, today I smoke. I feel like shit, I'm not proud of myself, and I feel like I put so much energy in something for nothing. I disappointed myself, my bf and my parents.

Today is a shitty day. I just gave up, and I feel like shit. 

The good thing is that I feel like I now realize that smoking doesn't give me anything or doesn't make me feel good at all. Smoking does not taste good or does not make me proud of myself. Smoking does not make my body feel good. 

I also realize that the simple rule (never smoke another puff) is so fucking right. I couldn't smoke only one cig today... But as I smoke, I finally realize that I'm not a smoker: I'm an ex-smoker - my body and my mind can't take the fact that I'm smoking today (head ache, stomach ache, my eyes are burning, etc.

Nicotine monster: 1, myself: 0

Tomorrow, I'll step my game up and I'll focus on what I'm learning right now. Today is just a shitty day.

Edit: thank you so much everyone for thr good words and the encoragement. It's really helping!!!!

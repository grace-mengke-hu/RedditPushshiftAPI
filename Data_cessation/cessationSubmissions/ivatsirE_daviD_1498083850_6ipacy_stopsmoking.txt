I just smoked my last cigarette

I wish with all my heart that this statement remains true for the rest of my life.

Just wanted to make this post as a reminder to myself, so everytime i get the urge to smoke i can come back to it and remember what it was like to feel the inside of my mouth and lungs rotting.

I never want to have this nauseating experience ever again and will try to muster all the willpwer i have to fight the urge.

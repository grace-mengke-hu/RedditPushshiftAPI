I want tomorrow to be day 1!

Smoking has been my crutch for 21 years, I have never been able to quit without feeling total grief and loss! 

I quit smoking marijuana 18 days ago, the withdrawals are manageable and I used it a lot. So why am I so reluctant to give up this last part of the old me? 

I’m going to be 38 in a month and I want to be free of all the things that will deliberately make me ill! 
I’ve read Allen Carr, I’ve been hypnotised, I want it so badly, but I something is stopping me from taking the leap. I’m reading your success stories and wish I was writing my own!!

Allen Carr method confused

in my second attempt i quit cold turkey after reading Allen Carr's easy way and only way method books. I might also watch the dvd and the videos on the iphone app after quitting too :-). As of today i have no idea if i am happy or not. I dont particularly feel happy. I dont have any desire to smoke either (feels that way) . That moment of revelation mentioned in the book never showed up. Could someone please describe what cravings are like  ? I need to know if i am on the right path or not.  Is it possible that i am way too counter-brainwashed ?

Now sure how this sub works but I got 41 days today.

Hey everybody, just wanted to share that I hit 41 days not smoking today. I'm using the patches to help with the cravings. I still have times that I want to smoke almost everyday but overall I'm doing well. 

I started working out pretty much right when I quit and I do that 5 days a week. I have a vape but I dont really use it and when I do it's zero nicotine. 

My dad* also quit about 2 days before me, he had a heart attack and so that's a big motivation for me to stay quit, so he stays quit with me. 

Good luck to everyone who has quit or is trying to quit. It isn't easy but the benefits will definitely outweigh the benefits of smoking which there isn't. It just kills you and makes you think it's helping you but it isn't.

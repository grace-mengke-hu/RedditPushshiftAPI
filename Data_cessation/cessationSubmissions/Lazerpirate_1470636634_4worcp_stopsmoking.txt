How long is the lung clearing phase going to take

Hi. Im semi quits cigs (on a vape pen now) Im hacking up the tar and crap from my lungs. All though its good to see my lungs clearing out its not exactly pleasant experience lol. I was curious how long roughly this will last. I know it will differ from person to person but there is probably an average time. cheers

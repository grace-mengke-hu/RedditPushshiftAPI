Day One!!

Wish me luck! My boyfriend just up and quit smoking on Tuesday and said it was super easy(a-hole). So I figured I'd give it a shot, since it was my idea in the first place. I'm very nervous, am going cold turkey, and am not at all confident. I'm hoping that quitting before going to bed will help give me a head start! I dread tomorrow. I have to get up early and go straight to work in retail... I hope I don't bite off anyone's head.

Anyways...

TALLY HO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

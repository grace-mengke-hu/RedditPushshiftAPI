10 Days Smoke Free

I'm only 10 days into my quit but this feels like it's finally my quit. Been a smoker for 46 years and have many attempts under my belt but have never felt so much relief at letting go of the dirty, stinky,  health sucking habit. This time I decided to try a hypnosis app along with the patch and signing up for this program. This time I really and truly feel proud if every craving I get through and of each day of being a non smoker.

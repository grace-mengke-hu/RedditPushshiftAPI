Day 4 -- Dealing with dizziness

Hi All.  Thanks for reading.  I'm on day 4 of my quit (cold turkey).  I was a pack+ per day for over 27 years.  So far, the cravings have been manageable but just want to ask, has anyone had to deal with pretty extreme dizziness?  I have been feeling off-balance and very dizzy for the past 2 days.  I've tried drinking water but it's not really helped much.  

Any advice on how to handle this or is this just part of the recovery process and will pass in time?

Thanks again for reading.

Well hoping this is it!

Hello All! A newbie here. I smoked my last smoke Friday night! I have been smoke free since then. I'm using the champix to quit. I have used it several times in the past and I know it works if I take it....That is always my kicker. It makes me sick so I stop taking it or I haven't been really trying to quit. This time feels different. I quit 18 years ago for 12 years. Why I started again was stupid.

Inapproprite coping technique and a weight loss surgery transfer addiction lead me back to smoking 5 years ago. I know this. I understand my whys...I have kept off over 130lbs for 7 years now. I am terrified of gaining it back. I have tried to quit about 6 times in this 6 years. I can do this! I really feel I can successfully beat this monster this time. I look foreward to joining you all and being a source of support as well. We can all do this!

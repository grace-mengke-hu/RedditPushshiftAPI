6 months!!

On December 16, I put down smoking for good after nearly 11 years of smoking a pack per day. Soon after, the cough went away, and I became more alert in the mornings. After a month, I was able to do 10 pushups in a row with good form; later, I bumped it to 15, then 20. I started cycling and can now ride long distances without a problem. My goal is to do a century (100-mile ride) by the end of the summer, and I know I can achieve that as long as I stick to it!

I couldn't have done it without the inspiration and camaraderie that this community provides! Thank you so much...I feel like I have my life back!

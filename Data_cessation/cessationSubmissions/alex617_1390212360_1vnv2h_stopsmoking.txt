Proud of myself - the main reason I quit smoking and it's all happening

Hi guys. I can't believe after 2.5 years of a  1-2 pack a day romantic relationship with cigarettes I am over a month in and not seeing any chance of ever going back.

All this time I promised myself I would quit before a major surgery I'm scheduled to get, a major jaw surgery. I know I'd retard recovery with my habit so I always said I'd definitely quit after that. Well I quit well before the actual surgery and it's coming tomorrow and I'm extremely stressed, the last thing on my mind is a cigarette.

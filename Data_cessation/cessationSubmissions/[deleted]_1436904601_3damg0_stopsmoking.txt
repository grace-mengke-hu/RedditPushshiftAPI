Need a way to reward my self after doing something useful..

It's so funny that I've always thought my cravings and relapses, while trying to quit, were caused by negative events. Today I truly realised it's the small (or big) achievements what makes me feel good. 

Today I got our woodshed ready and almost subconsciously thought I should have few smokes. I guess I won't really need any rewards (from me to myself) but maybe it would help with the craving for "reward cigarette".

Anyone had/having similar stuff going on? Do you reward yourself? How?

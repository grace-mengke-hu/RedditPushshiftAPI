I quit once for almost two weeks. It is by far the longest I have gone without a cigarette since I started smoking.

I became depressed for circumstances in my life and fell back into it. I smoked again for 11 days.

But tonight I had my last cigarette. And I mean it. I loved those two weeks. I want them to be the rest of my life. I love being a non-smoker. I love my life and I want to cherish it instead of destroying it.

I recently had a pneumothorax because of smoking

Hello everyone ! 

First of all I would like to apologize if I make mistakes ; English is not my mother tongue :)

On Thursday 22 June I just got out from my work I began to feel a sharp pain above my heart, like I was getting stabbed with a knife. I had this type of sensation before but it was never this painful. 

After going to ER and doing a chest X-ray I was informed that I had a penumothorax. 

For those that don't know what a pneumothorax is: basically I had a pocket of air in my lungs, smoking cigarettes everyday weakened my lungs.

But here is the thing: I'm a fairly young (22yo), and was a smoker for 4 years only.
I knew that if I kept smoking something like that would've happened but I didn't know it would happen this early. It really open my eyes on this subject. 

Fortunately it wasn't at an advanced stage so they didn't need to put a drain in my lungs and I only needed to rest for 3 weeks. If I kept smoking it would have been way worse.


If you are still a smoker and browsing through this sub to get motivation, know that it doesn't matter if you are young because you can always be affected by this crap. The best time to stop smoking is right now !

Have any of you guys had similar experiences ? I'm ready to discuss this matter with you !

Thank you for reading, have a good day/night :)

130 days and a new milestone. Feeling so good right now.

My SO has been out of town for the last two weeks.  Previously, this would be something I looked forward to so I could smoke freely at home (I was a secret smoker), most nights accompanied by several drinks (often enough to feel at least vaguely hung over the next morning).  I would get little done, stay up too late to get an extra smoke or two in, feel like shit most days,  and be scrambling at the last minute to clean up and get things in order before she arrived home.  

Not this time, reddit!  In the two weeks she's been gone, I've made a change in my diet and lost 5 lbs., gotten a bunch done in the yard, cleaned and organized the garage, marked off a bunch of other smaller things on my to do list, and even managed to watch both seasons of House of Cards (well, I'm starting the season 2 finale as soon as I post this).  

I feel like my life has changed so much in the 4+ months since I quit smoking, and this subreddit has had a lot to do with keeping me smoke free.  For those of you just starting out, it does get better and it's often so much bigger than just losing the cigarettes.  Smoking drags many of us down in so many areas of our lives, and it doesn't have to be that way.  

TL:DR  Not smoking is one of the best things that ever happened to me.  Thanks, r/stopsmoking!

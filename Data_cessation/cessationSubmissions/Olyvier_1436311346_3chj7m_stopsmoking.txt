Been thinking about it, now is the time

Just smoked the last cig of my (hopefully) last pack. Been thinking about it since i stopped weed (3months ago) and now i just smoked the last cig i can afford until my next paycheck if i want to eat and put gas in my truck! See you guys pretty much everytime i got a urge, it'll be a tough run. If you got any tips about what to do when you are around other smoker (im a mechanic, pretty much all my coworker smoke 1 to 2 pack a day) it would be really appreciated!

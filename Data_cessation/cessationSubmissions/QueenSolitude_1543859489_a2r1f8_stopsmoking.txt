Mental health Discord server

**Hey**, I have created a server that focuses on people with mental illnesses. It's a place where you can talk to others who might be relatable and helpful, but also a place to get ideas on how you can improve yourself and your life. You do not have to have a mental illness in order to join, but keep in mind that that's where the servers focus is.

The server encourages happiness and improving yourself. Glamorizing mental illnesses and encouraging people to harm themselves is prohibited.

If you are studying something related to mental illnesses or well-being, or if you have a job related to one of those things, you can have a role that shows you are a professional and willing to talk to people in case they have questions or need advice.

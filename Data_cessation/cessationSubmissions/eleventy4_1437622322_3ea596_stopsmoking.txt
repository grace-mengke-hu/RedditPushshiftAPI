First day of Chantix... Wish me luck! Any experiences you'd like to share, please do!

I did enough reading and decided the benefits outweigh any risks.  I found most of the online reviews are not very quality, and many complaints sound like behavioral changes to be expected with quitting smoking.  Please share your success stories to alleviate my anxieties, although negative is ok as long as you don't freak me out.

1 year down, the rest of my life to go.

I have been a bit of a lurker in this sub for the past year or so, but I wanted to say thank you.  Without the constant reminders and the tracking of the days, I may not have made it this far.  It still isn't always easy, but I find that over time it has become less and less of a struggle and I am optimistic for my future of staying off of nicotine.  

Good luck to all of you who are just starting, keep pushing through and life will become noticeably better.

Is there a vape that is all water vapor, no nicotine?

So I hate that I smoke. Of all the drugs I've tried and everything else, it is easily the most addictive thing I haven't been able to kick...Pretty crazy. I don't have an addictive personality at all but I've allowed myself to form habits in certain situations where I now smoke.

Either way, I realize my smoking habit got worse when I would drive because I literally have nothing else to do in the car while I'm in my commute each day so I grab a cig. 

I feel that I can help myself kick this habit if I had some sort of portable vape that would allow me to inhale vapor/smoke, of any kind. Does a water vapor e-cig type of thing exist that works well?

If not, is there a good recommended vape?

Four weeks in, here's an update

Four weeks today! 

This is now the second longest non-smoking streak I've had since I picked up the habit. I feel like I am attacking this the right way this time, and am quietly confident that I can make this stick. I would like to list a few **ideas that have helped** me, and will hopefully help someone else.

1. **Accepting that I was an addict:** There's no two ways about this. When my brain tries to convince me that one cigarette, or just one puff will not harm me, I try to remember this and it seems to help. I was an addict, and I have to make a real effort to never be addicted to this rubbish again.
2. **Cigarettes do not relieve stress:** I finally managed to drill this into my thick skull. Now, the only times I really badly want a smoke is when I'm stressed out or mad about something, and that's just out of habit because that was how I coped for years. I now want to smoke, and immediately something in my head goes "what for? You know that isn't going to help". Lots of posts on this sub and the ideas from Allan Carr's book helped convince me of this important fact.
3. A **visual reminder** of how far I've come has been very motivating. I started to use the Loop Habit tracker on android on the day I quit and I now look forward to marking that check box each night. I'm trying to build other good habits using this app, including improving my work ethic, exercising and waking up early, and I am seeing slow progress, but progress nonetheless. The "Smoke-free day" habit has been going strong though, so that's an amazing win.
4. Knowing that **I'm not the only one going through this**. It's another strange thing, but because of this sub, I know how hard quitting is, and I understand how many people struggle with this addiction, and how people who've stopped smoking years ago are still wary of falling back into the addiction. It gives me strength to know this, and has kept me on my toes over the past couple of weeks even when things have gotten a lot easier.

The **hard bits** until now:

1. My **mood** was affected fairly severely for the first week or two, especially day 4 - 10. I didn't realise it then, but I was incredibly cranky and moody and angry with the world, and managed to piss my SO off more than a few times.
2. **Living with a smoker**. It's hard because my SO still smokes, and therefore I always have access to cigarettes. But I think cigarettes are so easy to get that it wouldn't have been very different otherwise. There is a positive to this as well, though. Since my SO would also like to quit, I try extra hard! If I continue being a non smoker, I believe the SO will be inspired to quit too, and I care about their health much more than my own. It's a warped sort of logic, but I suppose there's positives in everything (except in smoking, of course!).
3. It's very tempting to smoke when I crack open a **beer**. It's how I started in the first place. But I've kept the alcohol consumption down to just a couple of beers over the last 4 weeks, and I'm definitely not going to get drunk anytime soon. 

It's only been 4 weeks, but I already see **positives**. It's quite amazing.

* I'm running, exercising, and bounding up steps like I haven't in years and I'm not panting like a dog after.
* I feel more confident about talking to people because I know my mouth doesn't stink of cigarettes.
* I've "saved" enough money to buy myself something nice. I haven't, yet, but I like seeing this number increase.
* I've given myself the confidence that I can build other good habits and be a better person.

This ended up longer than I expected it would be. I hope it helps someone. Good luck to everyone quitting now, congratulations and keep up the amazing work to everyone who's quit!

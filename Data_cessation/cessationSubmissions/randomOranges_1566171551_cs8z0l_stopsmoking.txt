Feel like I have lost a friend

I feel like I have lost a friend. Cigarettes used to be there when I needed a break, had a bad day, was happy, everytime. Now I stand in the balcony staring far away in the sky. The sky is beautiful but I don't have my friend to share with.

Nevertheless, I won't hate them but also not love them again. It's sad but I need to accept it. I have lost a friend.

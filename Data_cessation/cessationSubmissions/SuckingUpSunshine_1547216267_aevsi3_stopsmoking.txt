Romanticising smoking?!

It’s almost exactly 4 months since I smoked my last cigarette and whilst I haven’t had anything I would term a “craving” in months for the last couple of weeks or so I’ve been catching myself wishing that I hadn’t quit just so I would be able to mindlessly go outside, light up and waste 5 minutes breathing smoke in deeply and staring at the clouds.

I’ve gained so much from not smoking, I’m so proud of myself that I managed to, I can’t imagine myself as a smoker anymore, I know I won’t have another puff, and yet I’m catching myself longing to have not quit yet so I could just light a cigarette. Despite knowing the heath of my body and the strength of my mind have both improved it’s almost as though I would rather still be stuck feeling unable to quit and dejected.

I don’t know if this makes sense but it’s just what I’m feeling now, can anyone reassure me who has been through this? Thanks

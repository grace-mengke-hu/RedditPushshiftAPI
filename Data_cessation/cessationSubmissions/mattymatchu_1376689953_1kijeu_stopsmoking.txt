Don't know where to begin, Need some advice from you guys...

 Ive smoked a pack a day since i was 15, and I'm 28 now. I feel it's definitely time to quit. The trouble is even attempting to stop for me is a hurdle.  I think it's stupid to do this to myself. But every morning I wake up and fire one up. I tried the book and couldn't finish. I only smoked 6 cigarettes that weekend, Which I was proud of. Any stories on how to reframe the way I look at it would help. Thanks guys

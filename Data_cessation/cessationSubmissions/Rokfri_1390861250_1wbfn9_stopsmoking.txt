3 weeks!

Today marks 3 weeks for me without nicotine! It's my first attempt to quit ever, i was a half pack smoker for 14 years. Since it's my first time i am not sure what to expect and the hardest right now is to resist my curiosity how smoking just one cigarette would be like. 

Reading some of your experiences with quitting, i think my journey so far has been quite good, i think about smoking about 90 % of the day, but it's not too hard to resist it. When can i expect the thoughts of smoking fade?

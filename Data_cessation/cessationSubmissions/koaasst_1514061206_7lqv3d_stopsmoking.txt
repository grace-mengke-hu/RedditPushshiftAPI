10 years ago christmas i quit smoking 2 packs a day.

my dad wanted to quit a 3 pack a day habit to see his grandsons grow up, so i told him if he quit on his 3 month mark i would quit too. well he did and i kept my promise. i used chantix and ate lots of butterscotch worthers the first few months but once it was out of my system, my life was changed.

no more hacking up in the morning, but i think it made my adhd worse, lacking the nicotine. 

10 years later here i am looking for info on cutting these habitrol patches up to try to test nicotine on my adhd symptoms.

what a crazy world we have here.

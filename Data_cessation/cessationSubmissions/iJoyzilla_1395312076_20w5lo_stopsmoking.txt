Day One

I am a chronic asthmatic, 20 year old female, and a Mother of a kid with resp issues also (he doesn't currently live with me as I am in a custody battle that has been ongoing).

I decided today that I want my son to have the absolute best of everything in this world, and that includes a healthy Mum who can keep up with him (seriously 2 year old boys are insane) and also live and watch him live, get married, et cetera. Also I do not want him around ANY kind of toxins. Especially those that could inflict further damage to his lungs. 

Other reasons include, I can not smell at all. I am serious, nothing. I've been smoking approx. 6 packets per week for 8 years, and I wake up in the morning and can't remember what it feels like to be able to smell the morning cold. It terrified me beyond anything. I hate getting into my car and having a cigarette and writing my day off so quickly. The stench. The ash. My poor beautiful straight teeth that I am pretty much dooming to a life of issues. Breath. Skin. Lethargy to extreme levels. 

Also, I calculated I will save $5616 NZD per year. Um. That is a LOT of money to go towards kiddo, and maybe the odd spa treatment for me ;)

Lastly, it controls me. I have been in bankruptcy due to legal fees for close to a year now. I quit my job to pursue legal aid (free lawyers), and somehow manage to CREATE the money for cigarettes each week. 

I am regaining control of this bitch of a demon. Also, I am mental about gym and fitness, health and so on, so this would perfect that lifestyle AND make it easier.

Oh and one other thing, I am scared fucking shitless about doing this. And I am terrified I am already planning on failing. 

Wish me luck.

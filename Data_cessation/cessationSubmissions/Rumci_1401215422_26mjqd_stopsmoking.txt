Today is the day.

I'm broke. Yet I always find some cash for cigs, instead of saving it. Come to think of it, I just smoke whenever I'm bored. When I'm around people I love, such as my family and girflriend, I don't even feel the urge to smoke. I have promised everyone countless times that I will quit it, yet I still did it. But now I have found this place. I have found people who were just like me.

I'm writin this as a reminder to myself. I feel like when I give a promise to all of you out there, I just will have to keep it.

Trust me. Today is the day.

In Withdrawal

Been here a million times but this needs to be the LAST time.  This one is tough.  I can not think straight.  All I want to do is sleep. Or eat.  Last cigarrette was ... Sat 7pm.  I am either chilly and need a sweater or sweating and feeling feverish.  I know I will feel better soon... just wish it would hurry up!  Isnt 72 hours the usual turn around time?   Wish me luck...  say a prayer for me....  my life truly depends on this.

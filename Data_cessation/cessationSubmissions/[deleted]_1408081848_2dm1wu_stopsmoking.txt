60 days behind, rest of the life ahead

I've been smoking more or less since 5th grade (I'm 21 now), that's almost half of my life! It's finally time to change my whole lifestyle. I really wanna live a long, healthy life so that gives me motivation to quit and start working out, i'm never going to look back.

I don't know what else to say, i'm just proud of myself and all you guys who have balls to quit. I know it's not easy but we can do it together! Whatever it takes, stick with your decision. No bullshit, no excuses. Your body and brain tries everything to get a single taste of that sweet sweet smoke but fuck that, it's not worth it.

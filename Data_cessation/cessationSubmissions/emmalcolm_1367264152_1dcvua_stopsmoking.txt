I've just decided to quit, Right now

I smoked my last cigarette on my way in to work this morning and was thinking about how on my lunch break I'm gonna need to go to the store and grab a pack and it just hit me . . . NO! i don't need em, nor do I need a reason or Due date to quit, it's just as simple as not buying or smoking anymore Cigarettes. 

this isn't my first time trying to quit Cold Turkey but I'm certain it will be my last. I recently quit weed and drinking - two major vices - and started working out as well, but it's silly to me to be working on my fitness and detracting from it by smoking. 

I have a feeling I will be in this SubReddit an awful lot in the coming weeks but I'm glad it exists. My experiences with quitting weed is that a fellowship is absolutely needed if it's gonna work. At least in my case. 

Thanks for listening/Reading.

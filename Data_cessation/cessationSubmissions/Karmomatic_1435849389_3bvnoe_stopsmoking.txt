Yesterday was my quit date, but...

Yesterday was my quit date, but i'm still having trouble not smoking with my morning coffee. I spent all of June cutting back so I could quit smoking July 1st. I still see it as a huge accomplishment going from 15 cigs a day to just 1 cig a day these past two days and an e cig to fight my craving ( which I would like to quit using also). I've tried using an e cig with my coffee but it's just not the same. Does anybody have any tips/tricks to stop smoking with coffee, I've already been able to stop smoking with beer too, so I consider that another huge accomplishment as well. Any advice will be greatly appreciated.

WTF dreams?

So I am working on day #3 and I am having some messed up dreams.  I dream that I want, nay crave one, and yet every time I try to go have one, something goes wrong and I can not have one.

A prime example would be the dream that I had that I had found a dumpster with a bunch of high end purses in it.  I decided I would go in and take a look and low and behold I found a purse with my brand of cigarettes in it.  However, someone came along hat I knew, and I put them down and jumped out to go talk to them and as soon as I jumped out the dumpster was picked up and emptied.  Very weird.

Not sure if there is a meaning to the post.  Just wanted to share. :)

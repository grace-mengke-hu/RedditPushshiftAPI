Exactly one month without smoking!

And I feel this is the definitive quitting attempt. After 30 days (is there something wrong with the counter?), I feel very confident. Much more than my previous attempts.

I haven't had any significant urges in the past 2 weeks and only minor ones in the first two weeks. This time around, I read Allen Carr's book before quitting and that was the last kick I needed to quit for good.

I feel much better than a month ago. Really happy with this decision.

Keep up the good fight!

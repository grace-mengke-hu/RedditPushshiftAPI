We were free all along!

I have been lurking for 4 years. This habit is the reason that I have finally decided to turn to you all and break my self-imposed silence. Any advice is welcome however rehashed anyone might think it is. Your advice might resonate with me in a in a way it did not before.

The act of extinguishing a cigarette on whichever surface presented itself and telling myself it would be the last time has been repeated very, very often.  I have told myself I'm a non-smoker several times a day. However simply looking at anyone smoking was enough to get me into it again. 

Reading about it triggered me. 

Thinking about smoking and really anything related was an obvious trigger.

In fact, even the frustration and self-loathing that followed out of withdrawal was a false reason for me to light up yet again. I thought the anger would motivate me. I've tried being kind to myself. I've read Alan Carr's book. I've lurked on here forever and even wrote a piece for my own funeral as if it would be a result of smoking. Yet I still smoked.

I'm loath to try NRT as I strongly believe it will prolong the suffering instead of moderating it. I've come to see how strong this primal part of the brain indeed is that caused me to pull the lever as if I was one of the rodents in Rat Park. I was overconfident in my ability to reason my way through it. When stress hit I relapsed faster than I could finish a coherent thought.

I've approximately smoked a pack a day for the past 3 years, I said I was done 14 times. Eight out of those 14 were in the last 4 weeks. I'm done approaching it as my suffering. This is (or was) yours to face as well. I will suffer not alone but together through this patch. All I ask of you is to stand with me and end this spell many of us have been under. Nicotine is a bitch and it's time to put her to bed.

WE ARE NON-SMOKERS.

Tl;Dr: Not another puff.

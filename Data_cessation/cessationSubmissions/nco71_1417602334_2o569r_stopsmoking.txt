100 days and still fighting !!!

100 days,  so different mood , so many cravings as well , sometimes short , sometimes long , sometimes so depressed. I have been drinking some whisky before to go to sleep sometimes , but afraid to make it another habit, daily meditation helped a lot as well. 

Next target to celebrate is half year , it would be over my last record ( 4 months )  , then a year and then every year would be an amazing feet. 

I always feel like I am only one cigarette away to be a smoker, so I always try to be careful.

Thanks a lot to the awesome reddit community who helped so much.

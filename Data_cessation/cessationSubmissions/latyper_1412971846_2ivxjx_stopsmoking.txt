1 month smoke free

One month smoke free. 

I just want to let everyone know that it gets easier. Earlier today, I passed some people smoking while I walked to work. I did not feel the envy or desire that dominated the first few weeks. Instead I felt pity. I felt sorry for them because I knew that they were all struggling to satisfy an inner craving for nicotine that I was now free of. 

What really helped me get this far was this video:

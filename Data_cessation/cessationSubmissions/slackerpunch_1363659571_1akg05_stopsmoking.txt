I'm doing this because I love her. More than I love cigarettes. (Day 5)

We've fought over it enough times. She told me she doesn't want to be with me if it means somewhere down the road, she's going to have to watch me die from some medical problem. She doesn't like kissing an ashtray. And I'm sick of sneaking around on her, puffing a quick smoke before washing my hands and rinsing with mouthwash just so she doesn't catch on.

I love cigarettes, but she means more to me than anything else in the world. She believed in me when I didn't believe in myself. If it weren't for her, I'd still be working a dead end job and drinking myself to sleep. She helped me pick myself up off the ground, and go back to school to get my degree. And if quitting smoking means having another year or two that I get to be with her, then it's worth giving up smoking.

So, here we go.

Going Patch Less Hit Me Hard. When does it get better?

I stopped awhile ago with patches.  I know some of you disapprove of NRT but there is no chance I could've made it this long without them.  Zero.

I've been patch less for about a week and I feel miserable and I'm poisoning relationships around me both social and work related.  Everyone knows I'm trying to quit but I can tell some people's patients are wearing thin.  My best friend and I got into a fight yesterday.  That's the first fight we've ever gotten into in 2.5years of knowing each other.

I hate myself lately I feel like I'm about to ruin relationships that are very important to me.  Will my irritability and depression go away soon?  I can't deal with this and I don't know what to do.  I just want to be my normal self again.

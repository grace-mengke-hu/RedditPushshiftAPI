36 hours in

So last time I quit, I quit for my kid and it was bad.  I was cranky, craving but I got through it and was "clean" for 4 years.  Then I went back and smoked like a chimney for 4 years and then 36 hours ago I decided I am done. My lungs feel better already but I find  it really odd I haven't had  any cravings, my SO is smoking up the last of the cigs and I am not even tempted, it doesn't smell good to me.  Can anyone explain?  Is it because this time I am doing it for me?

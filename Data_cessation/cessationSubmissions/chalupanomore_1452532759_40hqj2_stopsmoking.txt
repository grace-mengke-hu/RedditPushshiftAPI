Something that helped me greatly

As you all know I was struggling emotionally last week. A LOT. However, I had somewhat of an emotional breakthrough and it has made my day to day life so much easier.

Honestly, it sounds stupid, but I decided that I was done smoking. I didn't care. I don't care. The anxiety that smoking caused me, when was I going to get my next fix, do I smell, do I need to brush my teeth more, is this causing me health problems, was so much worse than just deciding no. It was like a big fuck you cigarettes I don't care about you anymore and you can't sit with us situation. 

I feel good. My body feels happy. My mind mostly feels happy. Either way, you can do this. You can fight this. Those little assholes don't get to win AND THEY CAN'T SIT WITH US.

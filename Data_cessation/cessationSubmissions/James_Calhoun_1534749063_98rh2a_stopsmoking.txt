FINALLY! One year! 365 days! Not a single puff!

After many failed attempts, I can finally say that I am one year smoke free. Luckily the app on my smartphone reminded me of the fact that its been one year otherwise I wouldn't even think about it. Smoking is not on my mind anymore. AT ALL. I am so happy I got back on the wagon after yet another failed attempt otherwise I wouldn't have been here: healthy, wealthy (smoking SUCKS the money right out of your wallet, ugh!) and free of addiction! You can do it people, you have everything to gain and nothing to lose by ditching the cancer sticks!

Day 2

As the title says I'm on day 2 without smoking. Feeling really good and confident about it, really looking forward to my lungs clearing up (i'm almost looking forward to the coughing up big chunks of phlegm stage!). I can already tell the nicotine withdrawl is going to kick my ass for a couple of days, didn't sleep well last night and i'm probably going to be asleep at my desk by lunchtime but hey, it only lasts a few days. Looking forward to day 3.

Hard to distance myself from my image as a smoker

This might turn into a very long post but here goes, for those with enough patience to read it. :)

I started smoking in my teens, when I was about 15, mostly for all the reasons teens start smoking - being rebellious, bad-ass, etc. I turn 26 this August so that adds up to almost 11 years as a smoker of a pack a day and sometimes more. I recently had two wisdom teeth removed and couldn't smoke for 48 hrs so I decided to see how long I can go even after the two mandatory days passed. I am now in my 6th day as a non-smoker, and can deal with my triggers and cravings pretty easily despite living with three smokers and living in a country where smoking is permitted in bars, restaurants, etc. 

The problem I have most trouble with is that smoking has become so much a part of my identity, or at least the way I perceive myself, that it is hard to imagine myself as a non-smoker for the rest of my life. I had a previous quit attempt that lasted for about 8 months a few years ago, and though I was physically feeling very good about quitting, it just seemed to be ... not me. 

I am having this issue again, and really don't know how to deal with it other than venting here. I feel not like losing a friend or a pleasure, but losing a part of myself, of my character. I know it sounds ridiculous, but smoking is just THAT deeply buried in my psyche. I sort of have moments when I feel free of a burden and very proud ofmyself and then there are the moments when I feel like I'm pretending to be something I'm not.  

Has anybody else gone through this? 

**TL;DR Long-time, hardened smoker having trouble coping with quitting, seeing it as a loss of identity.**

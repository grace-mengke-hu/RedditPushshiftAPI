Hit a pretty great milestone over the weekend!

According to my app, Quitit, over the weekend I reached 1,000 cigarettes *not* smoked since I quit.  Pretty disgusting thinking about just how many cigs I was smoking.  The first time I realized I was "a smoker" was when I looked back and realized I had probably smoked 1,000 cigarettes since I started, and over the next few years I smoked thousands and thousands more, so I'm really happy right now.

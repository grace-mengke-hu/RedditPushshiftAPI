It's been five days since I quit smoking cigarettes. It's been a week since I've had any weed. And you know what? I feel fucking fantastic.

Back-story, I'm an 18 year old who has been smoking for the past couple of years. I've been lazy and unmotivated to do anything with my life and I've fallen into poor and unproductive habits. My health isn't great and my life lacks any sort of direction or meaning. I was stagnating and allowing myself to continue a downwards spiral.

On Tuesday I was outside the train station at the bus stop, waiting for my bus home with two friends of mine. We were having a casual conversation as you do, and I was puffing away on my Cigarette. I zone out of the conversation for a minute and think to myself "why the hell am I smoking this. I thought I was meant to be quitting." After a short while of tossing up between destroying my remaining smokes and waiting until my pack's done to "quit", I decided that I want to destroy those fucking toxic, good for nothing rods of shit. And so I did. And it felt great.

I get off at my stop in my home town and see my friend just about to skate down the road. I call out his name, get his attention and hang out with him for the evening. He planned on buying a half bag of weed, like he does every single week out of habit. He knew he couldn't really afford to do it this week but he still wanted to. I had a word to him about how he doesn't need it and how he's only doing it to satisfy his habit. I convinced him not to buy any that week. I was quite proud of myself.

I also haven't smoked any weed this week, and have decided to make it a strictly social thing after realizing how truly overrated it is.I'll have a small amount with friends instead of getting stoned out of my mind several times a week (good thing I can't afford to smoke every day, otherwise I would have). I've felt more motivated from this and it's kept my head clear.

It's been a bit tricky. I've been tempted to smoke a couple of times. But I've just remembered that the key is willpower. Just say no. Whenever you think you want to smoke remember the truth; **you really, really don't**. Quitting and cutting down has helped me realize that change is possible and easier than you think. I refuse to stagnate into a shitty person with nothing going for them. Quitting is going to mark the beginning of a new chapter in my life and I am going to improve in every single way I can. Life begins at the end of your comfort zone, don't fear it. Act now and change, don't wallow in your failure and self-pity, only to become worse and worse until all hope is gone. 

I am going to cut out all my negative relations. I'm going to improve my social skills. I'm going to become closer with my friends and show them that I care about them. I'm going to be less cynical and be a more likable, positive person. I'm going to learn how to play piano. Real emotions are going to return to me. I'm going to beat my depression. I'm going to come out of the closet. I'm going to become better in school. I'm going to get a job. I'm going to find love. I'm going to make films. I'm going to paint pictures. I'm going to learn German. I'm going to eat healthier. I'm going to get fit. I'm going to write poetry and stories. I'm going to be who I always wanted to be, rather than thinking about being who I want to be and how great it would be, and then doing fuck-all about it.

I owe this motivation to quitting cigarettes. This is a turning point in my life. No room for failure. I don't hope, I **know for a fact** that my best days are ahead of me. A happy, healthy, smoke free life.

Edit: Gold, eh? I never thought I'd have the honor. Thank you very much. I'll be sure to pass it on to somebody else one day.

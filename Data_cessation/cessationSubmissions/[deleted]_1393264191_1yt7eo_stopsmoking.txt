So after failing miserably Friday night. I have now been without a smoke since then!

I went to a bar to watch a friends band play.  Let me say I just set myself up for failure on that one.  Woke up Saturday with my chest hurting and a slight hangover.  I haven't smoked since Friday night.  This has been the longest amount of time since I turned 18 that I have been without a cig(I'm 25).  I know its still early but I can't wait to start feeling the improvements from quitting.  I have been eating everything in sight it seems since I quit.  So you could say my appetite has improved.

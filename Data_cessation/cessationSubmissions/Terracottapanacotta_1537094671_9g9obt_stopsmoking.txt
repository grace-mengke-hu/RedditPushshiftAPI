Excessive lethargy?

Anyone else found chronic sleepiness to be a symptom? I’m on day four and every day I’ve been falling asleep on the lounge and taking myself to bed at 830pm ( usually I will go to bed at 10:30-11:30) and am struggling to get through the day. I googled to see if it was a symptom and I couldn’t see it anywhere

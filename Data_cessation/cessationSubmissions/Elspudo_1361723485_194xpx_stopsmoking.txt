What are the best anti smoking apps for the iphone?

I plan on giving up smoking for my birthday and i would like to know what are some of the best apps for quitting?  Basically what I would like from the app is that it free.  It shows health benefits, how long you have quit for, how much you have saved (I smoke hand rolled so being able to program in the cost would be good).

Thanks =)

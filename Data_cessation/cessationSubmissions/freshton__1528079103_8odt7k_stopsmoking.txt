My Reason to Quit

As I'm writing this I'm in hour 17 with out a smoke. This isn't the longest I've been without out a cigarette, but this time it feels different. I've tried to quit a few times now and all attempts ended with me smoking another $32.95 away. Times that by 4 and it's $131.8 a week. I only earn $530 a week. Just writing that down is blowing my mind. How dumb! 

I don't want to live forever, but I do want to live for as long as I can and being an asthmatic, cigarettes are not helping that. Again: how dumb! 

But the reason for this attempt at quitting is not just the money, or my health. This time it's for a girl. My girlfriend. I know I should be doing it for myself but I've tried that. I care more for her than I do myself. I've tried patches, gum, mints and the spray. None of those worked for me. So maybe this time it will be different. I want to spend as much time with this girl as I can. I want to have money to spoil her. So this time has to be different. 

Writing this post has really helped with the cravings so I will most likely post more. I'm using the nicotine gum as well because I'm not capable of doing it cold turkey. The last time I tried I ended up on antidepressants. Other things also contributed to this but the nicotine withdrawals didn't help. I'm thinking of investing in a vape with low mg oil. I've heard good things about them and I'll take all the help I can get. 

So wish me luck, cross your fingers and I'll cross mine. I'm nearly into hour 18 as I finish this last paragraph. It's nearly break time at work and I don't know what I'm going to do with myself. Maybe I'll call my reason to quit.

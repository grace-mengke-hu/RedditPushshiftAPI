Managing Withdrawal Symptoms


I've smoked for about five years, and quit cold turkey on Sunday. So far, I haven't had the slightest urge to smoke, no psychological withdrawal. However, the physical symptoms are hell. I can barely sleep and I've never felt so sick. Do any of you have advice on coping with physical withdrawal?

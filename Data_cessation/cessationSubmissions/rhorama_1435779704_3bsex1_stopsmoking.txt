Can I cut the Nicotine Patches

Hi, I got free nicotine patches from my student health center. Problem is, they're too big (only size they had) and make me feel crazy jittery, restless, etc. 

I want to cut them in half, but it says no cutting on the box. Is there actually some sort of membrane that gets disrupted, or am I safe to split em?

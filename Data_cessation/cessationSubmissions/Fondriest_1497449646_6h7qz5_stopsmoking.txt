Any recommended resources to help father quit?

What is the most recommended way to help someone quit smoking? I am home visiting family and I found out my dad has started smoking again. He has had 2 heart attacks with the last one resulting in a quad bypass. The doctor told him he could live another 20 years if he stopped, but if he started again he would only have 5 years left. This was 2.5 years ago. He is 61 now. He used to be a 1-2 pack a day smoker, claims to only have a 6 a day now. 

In the past, I believe he has tried the patch/gum and even going to a hypnotist. My wife and I plan on having kids at some point in the next couple years but even the prospect of him having grandkids doesn't make him want to stop. 

I've never smoked a day in my life after growing up watching my grandfather, uncle and dad all have heart attacks in their early 40s. I want to help my dad but I'm not sure the best way to help him. I was planning on giving him a quit smoking book for fathers day but I don't know if he will actually read it. What is the best way to help someone else quit?

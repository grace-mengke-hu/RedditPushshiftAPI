Did any of you guys have to quit drinking for awhile to stop smoking?

I don't know about you guys but when I have 3-4 beers in me I NEED a cig more than anything. It is all I think about if I don't have one. I really want to stop smoking but I don't know if I can quit drinking too. I love drinking on the weekends, and I don't know if I am strong enough to turn down a cig after a couple drinks.

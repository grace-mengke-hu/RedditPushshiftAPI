One Month

So I've made it to a month today. (The flair is a day out I'm guessing timezone or some shit?)  
  
It's not been easy and I can't say I didn't have a wee smoke on my birthday at the start of the month (so I guess it's slightly off) but it was disgusting. Been through my first full week and weekend in 13 years without a smoke and I feel amazing!  
  
Thanks to this sub for pointing out a lot of books and techniques I can use to stay smokefree.

It’s going to be ok!

I asked our oldest son what do you want for your college graduation he said he didn’t want me to smoke. So I quit the next day. I feel great only thing is it’s hard hanging at BBQ’s and stuff because most of the people I hang out with smoke and it’s family. I typically only smoked when we would hang out and a couple during the week but still I was a smoker! Now that I’m almost a month in I’m realizing (we have 3 boys 22,20,16 )and they are super proud but I really am finally concentrating on me! and ITS GOING TO BE OK☺️

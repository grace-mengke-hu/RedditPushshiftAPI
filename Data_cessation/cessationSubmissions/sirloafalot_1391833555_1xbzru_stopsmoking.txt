I only thought about how much I missed smoking eight times today.

And even then, it was only a passing thought. It wasn't a longing. It didn't make me want a cigarette. I didn't cry or get angry. 

It was just...something that entered my mind and passed in few seconds.

Woah. It IS possible to quit. 

I hope you all have the means and the desire to stay strong and stay stopped. I'm starting to really think it's worth it.

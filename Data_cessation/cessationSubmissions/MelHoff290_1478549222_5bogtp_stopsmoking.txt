Sorry for the uncomfortable bathroom subject matter

So I'm on day 8 of my quit and staying strong. I was on the patch the first 5 days and this weekend decided to see how I felt without it. As far as cravings, I'm good. But yesterday, day 2 of zero nicotine in my system, my stomach and bowels are a mess! I have had pretty severe stomach cramps since yesterday mid morning along with diarrhea. Is this withdrawal or do I have a stomach bug?

20 days ! A few helpful tips I have used

20 days and feeling fantastic!  A few tips that have helped me
1. Drink a lot of water.  It keeps your hands and mouth occupied just like smoking used to. Helps detoxify and hydrates 
2. I try to take a bath at night.  It aides in soothing the nerves especially the first week!
3. Stay busy!  Get all those projects done. Organize a closet, delete unwanted emails whatever it takes to keep yourself occupied.

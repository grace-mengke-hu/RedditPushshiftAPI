I thought i smoked!!

Today i had one really vivid dream, where i caved and smoked. 

&amp;#x200B;

I dreamt like i was smoking and it felt like it used to when i was an active smoker. But as the dream progressed i couldn't remember why i smoked. What was the trigger? did i fought the craving or just cave instantly? Thats when reality started to hit and realised the stupidity off what i had done and hoped i could turn back time to change it.

&amp;#x200B;

I woke up and realized it was a dream. I was so relieved, i guess i could actually turn back time. 

&amp;#x200B;

It was a dream to remind me of the guilt i would feel if i caved, it only made me stronger.

&amp;#x200B;

For experience of people who quit does this dreams become more frequent ? Will they eventualy tempt me to cave ?

Not one more puff ever.

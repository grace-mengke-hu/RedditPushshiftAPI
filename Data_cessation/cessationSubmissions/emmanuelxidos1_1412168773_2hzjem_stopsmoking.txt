Can't get past the first few days.

Hey guys, brand new here and quitting smoking today!!! I've tried to quit many, many times before and can never seem to get past the first few days without caving. Looking for some tips from those who have been successful in the past! I want to go cold turkey, but am up for trying anything you guys have found helpful!

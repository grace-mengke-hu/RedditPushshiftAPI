Trying to calculate my packyears.

Now I'm fairly certain it'd be &lt;1 because I've only been smoking for maybe 17 months and only at most, 4 cigarettes worth a day. 

Whether it be in a cigarette, mixed in with weed and smoked through a bong, or even by itself in a bong (nasty i know, but its a common thing in aus cause we're degenerates) I'd say at most it'd be 4, some days 0. 

I'm trying to figure this out so I can do the rough calculations for finding out when certain aspects should be returning to similar functionality of a non-smoker.

Would it be something like 0.3? Is it even worth trying to calculate?

I'm currently on my second attempt to stop. I love seeing the tar come up, but I have a question. It's completely normal to be blowing tar out of my nose also yeah? Shits all linked right lmao. Didn't have this the first time around, it was just coughing the shit up.

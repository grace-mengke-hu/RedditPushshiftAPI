10 months of temptation, I think I did it!

Last night marked my birthday and my 10 months of being free. I went out with friends and had a beer WITHOUT having the urge to smoke when I was buzzed. I didn't realize it at the time, but when I woke up, I felt so happy! 

Thank you everyone who shared their stories here and for the endless support. It wouldn't have been possible without knowing there were others paving the way. 

Stay strong and love life!

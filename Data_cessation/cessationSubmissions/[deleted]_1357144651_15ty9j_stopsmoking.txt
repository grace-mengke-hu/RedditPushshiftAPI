Getting out. All of your smiling stars are super encouraging!

Iâ€™m quitting today because I don't need them anymore. I can stop buying my little pack of 20 friends. That is all it is, a comfort that I can count on in my life, and I can buy from my work or Wawa/convenience store. But they are the complete opposite, they are completely inconvenient. They smell and stain. Make it hard to breathe. Force you out into the cold because they are not welcome inside. Cost you money that you could be spending on... anything else. I thought about recently how they are not only taking time and enjoyment off of the end of my life, but out of the one I am currently living.  This is a totally abusive relationship, and I can leave. The door is open.

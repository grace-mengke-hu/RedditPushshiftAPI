On my 3rd day without smoking...seems to be getting easier

Im not sure why but this time quitting seems to be easier than past times.  I guess it helps knowing I will be traveling with work people in the next few days and I know it is frowned upon to be a smoker.

Lets hope this time goes better than the previous

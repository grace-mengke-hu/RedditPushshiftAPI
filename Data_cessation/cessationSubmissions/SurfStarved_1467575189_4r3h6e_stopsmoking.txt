I have tried this a number of times but this time I am doing it without NRT.

I am using the Smoke Free app and it is proving useful so far.  I have always been able to quit smoking BUT only if I used NRT.  This time I am using this app instead of NRT.  The app gives you these missions each day to help eradicate the addiction...today I was told to get on reddit/r/stopsmoking 5 different times throughout the day. I haven't logged out but this is #3 today.  SO here I am...I am a non-smoking surfer/pharmacist and I know better than to have ever started smoking in the first place (a previous mission made you have to say it socially...I am counting this as that.) Hello Everyone!

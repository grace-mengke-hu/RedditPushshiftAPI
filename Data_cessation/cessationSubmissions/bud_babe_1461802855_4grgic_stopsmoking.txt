Using the app as motivation.

I've been using the Smoke Free app to keep track of how many cigarettes I've smoked in the hopes I'd see the number and be motivated to quit. Today I hit 415 in 28 days...I can't believe I have put that many cigarettes into my body! I am truly grossed out and more motivated than ever to quit. I'm going to try a guided meditation I found in another thread that you listen to while you sleep. 

I also posted a while ago about waking up at night to smoke, and that has thankfully stopped. I'm going to try my hardest this time to do it! I know better health and more energy are within my reach. I can do this. I'm so happy to have found this sub. Thanks for listening.

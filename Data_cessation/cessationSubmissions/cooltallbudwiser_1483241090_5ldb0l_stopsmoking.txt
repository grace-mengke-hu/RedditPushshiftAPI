I will not fail this time

Hello, 22 year old male here. I've been smoking for around 5 years now and the truth is I hate myself for it. I've tried to quit a few times before and it's never stuck. However, I'm here to promise you guys, and myself, that I will not fail to quit this time. 
I. Will. Not. Fail.

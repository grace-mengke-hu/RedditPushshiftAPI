How to control increased appetite?

Ever since I quit smoking a few days ago I've noticed that my appetite has dramatically increased. I find myself snacking a lot more than usual, however I am also looking to lose a little weight. Any suggestions on how to curb appetite, besides chewing a lot of gum and drinking a lot of water?

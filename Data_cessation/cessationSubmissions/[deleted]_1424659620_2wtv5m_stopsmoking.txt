my original post.

since quitting, I've not gotten my usual yearly bout of bronchitis, even though I'm still overweight I can go out hiking without getting exhausted, I've impressed the bosses at my new job since I no longer go for smoke breaks - and since I used to sacrifice actual breaks for ciggy breaks, I don't take breaks at all(not advice I expect anybody else to take).


The biggest thing that I notice is how repulsive the smell of stale smoke is, and the residual stink you give your clothes/body/hair. The first person I kissed screwed their face up and said it tasted bitter, I know exactly what they mean now...

Physical Withdrawal Symptoms after 2 months of juuling. Any advice for curbing concentration issues?

I made the stupid decision to juul while studying, and I’ve got a 7hr long test coming up in 2 weeks. I didn’t juul today and found it impossible to concentrate. Also noticing some mild chest tightness. 


What can I do other than exercise to curb the concentration and chest tightness symptoms? How soon can I expect a change? Is 2 months of almost daily (all day) juuling enough to fuck me over?

11 months quit, still getting mouth ulcers (Canker sores)

As above. They're driving me insane. I use special toothpaste and my diet isnt terrible, I'm not stressed about anything.

I've quit a few times in the past and would religiously get mouth ulcers. They tend to come in waves, where I get 3-7 at a time. Does anyone else suffer from this? Would going to the doctors be an option?


Thanks in advance

I don't even think about them.

Hey guys, i stumbled upon this subreddit after 3 weeks to realize that i hadn't been smoking for 4 weeks.

I guess now i'm a real non smoker. I don't even think about smoking.

It's really cool to be a non smoker.

Just wanted to drop some words for other people who started with not smoking! It's really worth it!

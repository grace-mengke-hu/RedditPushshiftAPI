What changed in 100 days

I don't stink anymore.
I don't have to go outside and stand in the rain while smoking.
I don't have to worry about forgetting a lighter.
I don't have to buy cigarettes, which getting more expensive every year.
I don't have to cough like a maniac when i get up early in the morning.
My girlfriend kisses me more often.
I can walk up the stairs without choking.
My skin is getting softer and cleaner.
Food tastes better.
I don't have to think about smoking every 10 minutes.
**I don't have to be a slave of the tobacco industry**

Today is day 1 :)

From age 18-26(ish) I smoked regularly. Maybe a pack every day or two.


From age 27-35 (now) I've been smoking 1-4, maybe 5 if I'm partying per day, sometimes going a few days without smoking. 


I've been fooling myself thinking that 1 or 2 a day "isn't smoking", but that's bullshit. I'm done. My wife and I are expecting our first child this summer and I want to be around for a long ass time.

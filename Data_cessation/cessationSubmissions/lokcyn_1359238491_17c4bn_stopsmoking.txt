I forgot I had two 15-min breaks at work

I started a new job on Thursday. On my way home from work yesterday, I realized that I didn't even think about the morning or afternoon breaks. The only reason I thought about lunch was because I was hungry. What I found odd about that was the fact that when I was a smoker and worked at any previous job over the past 25 years, there was always this underlying anxiety about when I'd be able to smoke the next cigarette. It feels wonderful to not feel such underlying anxiety all the time. Admittedly, after lunch or when I get in my truck to drive home after work, it seems as though something is missing or as though I should be doing something. It's nice that these are only passing thoughts and I don't feel as though I am being forbidden or robbed of something substantial. What little moments such as these have you noticed as a non-smoker?

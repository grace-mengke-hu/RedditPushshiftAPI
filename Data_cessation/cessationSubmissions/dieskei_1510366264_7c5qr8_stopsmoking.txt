Tony Soprano won't stop smoking cigarettes

I'm sitting at home having some beers, watching the Sopranos, and dammit they all smoke. 4 days in and I want one so bad. I'm just glad no one is around I can bum off, and the gas station is far enough that if I started walking maybe the craving would go away? What do you guys/gals think?

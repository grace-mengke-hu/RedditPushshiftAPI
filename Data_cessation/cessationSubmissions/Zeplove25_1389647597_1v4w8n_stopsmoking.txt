When does it stop?!

Today is day 57. Lately I've finally been noticing the benefits to quitting. (like being able to run on the treadmill and being able to breathe, as I posted about not too long ago.) Today however, is an awful day. I'm in the Chicago area - the temp is a fresh and summery 43 degrees - which is a HUGE change compared to the -40 windchills we experienced last week. That "fresh-air-summer-smell". It's killing me. 

As someone with a degree in psychology, I should absolutely know that smells are one of the biggest triggers of memories - and the addiction I have to cigarettes is causing me to remember smoking in a positive light, in this weather. It's causing me to want one. Hard core. 

It's causing me to think that I will be even MORE miserable than the first part of my journey - and why am I doing this anyway? So I can breathe on a stupid treadmill? I hate running anyway. 

I feel like I haven't quit, like I have only abstained. Has anyone felt this? Does this go away? When will I finally stop feeling that "hunger-pang-lung" syndrome. I feel like if I could have just one. I know it would never be just one. The only thing keeping me going at this point is knowing that I would have wasted almost 60 days. FML. 

I tried talking to a friend... A friend who has been insistent that I quit smoking for quite some time now. I got no response. ignored. SO. here I am. Help.

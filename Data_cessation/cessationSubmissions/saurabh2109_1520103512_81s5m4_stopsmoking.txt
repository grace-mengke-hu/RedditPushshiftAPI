Any programmers who quit smoking

Guys,
Just wanted to know if there are some programmers here who have successfully kicked this filthy habit.
I started smoking before I became a programmer. Now every bug requires a cigarette before I can start to solve it.
And once the bug is resolved , the reward has to be you guessed it right; a cigarette.
Whenever in past I have quit smoking ( maximum 2 weeks) ,I have felt a serious lack of concentration. I stop enjoying programming.
This is my biggest fear while trying to quit.
Any insights please?

One month in

Four weeks ago I posted that my dad had a heart failure and terminal lung damage diagnosis from smoking for 60 years. I just thought that I'd update and say that he has not has a cigarette cold turkey style for four weeks now and came off the oxygen tank after 4 days of not smoking.

Four days. Vs sixty years. 

He's still going to die from his lung condition as that s not reversible but if he can quit then what's your excuse? Make my dad your motivation for today

Just tossed my vape in the trash!

I’m done with the slavery!  I just finished Carr’s book and it’s helped me understand why I’ve vaped.  I’m the kind of smoker who would hit it in the morning and then go all day until night to hit it again.  I’d basically torture myself with withdrawal pangs all day and then take pleasure in relieving them at night when watching TV.  Over the years I’ve struggled with, “Relaxing at night in front of the tube will never be the same” but recently I’ve noticed that I don’t even really pay attention to the TV when vaping and after about 20 minutes of hotboxing, I turn it off and try to go to sleep because I feel like shit.  
Also, it really undermines my confidence and I think has lead to some mental health issues.  I always thought “I’m just an asshole” or “life is suffering” or “I just have anxiety”
I’ve tried to cope with these things with exercise, meditation, cannabis, mushrooms, and it dawned on me that I’ve been spending every day with a gnawing addiction in my stomach.  NO WONDER YOU FEEL LIKE SHIT!  
Anyway I’m done feeling this way.  Read Carr’s book it’s helped me look at quitting in a completely different way, and I’m looking forward to actually watching a full movie with my family tonight.  And many more...

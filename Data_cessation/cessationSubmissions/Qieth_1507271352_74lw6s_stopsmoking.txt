I almost forgot that I used to smoke

Holy hippopotamus, time flies when you're not killing yourself. I was surprised to see that my flair says 150 days. Is it really over four months since I had my last cigarette?

I still can't quite believe that I've just stopped smoking, just like that. I didn't suffer the widthdrawal pangs you usually do - or well, I did, but I managed them a whole different way this time.

16 years of smoking, or around 100.000 cigarettes, now a more or less distant memory. Oh sure, my brain will occasionally go "So, you just had dinner. Time for a smoke, right?", but I have no problem telling my brain "No, I don't want to smoke".

What made the difference this time around was my attitude. I have always had to "give up smoking", and I felt like I was punishing myself, which made the quit unbearable. I have realised that I don't *need* smoking, and that made all the difference. 

I am at a point now where I can say "I don't want to smoke" and believe myself, and I'm happy to call myself an ex-smoker. And I've never felt better!

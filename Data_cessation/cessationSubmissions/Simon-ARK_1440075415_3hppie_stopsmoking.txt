Made it 150 days. Then I lost it, and now I can't find the motivation to quit again.

I went 150 days until I was in rural Russia and basically forced to smoke whilst drinking and once I got home I started up again. I can't find the motivation to quit, all the hardship that I went through last time is lingering at the front of my head and are outweighing the benefits in my memory.

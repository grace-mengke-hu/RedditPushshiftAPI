25th day quit realizations

Background:

I was a smoker for 8 years. I quit 25 days ago.

Average: 15 sticks /day

Low: 2 sticks/day

Peak: 2 packs a day

Realizations:

Odor
-There's no other way to put it. Smokers stink! I was walking at the mall when one guy walked past me and he smelled of stale old cigarette. Very unpleasant. I used my old unwashed jacket and realized that's how I smelled like for years. I just masked it with perfume.

Cravings
-I craved bad during the first week. I still had mental cravings up until a week ago. This week is the first week that I don't even think about smoking.

Time management
-I sucked at managing my time when I was a smoker. I would make every excuse and find a time in a day to smoke.  I wasted hundreds of hours smoking. I went on extended smoke breaks at work.

Stress and anxiety
-I smoked to cope with stress and anxiety. I smoked to cope with depression. I did not want to take any other substance. I thought I was "safe" so I justified smoking. I'm still an anxious person. I must have some form of anxiety disorder. I still get stressed but I stress less now. The best part is I don't need to smoke to deal with stress anymore.

Withdrawal
-I had pretty bad withdrawal symptoms. I had brain fog, loss of focus and mood disorders. The worst is when I had a mini breakdown at work. I called my friend crying and met up after work. Everything started to get better after that incident.

Habit
-A big chunk of my daily activities and routine was associated with smoking. This meant that almost every single thing I do reminded me of smoking that I had to call myself out everytime.

Commitment
-I had to learn to stay committed to quit the smoking habit for good. This meant sticking to my pledge even when the going got tough. I feel like a more responsible adult for this.

4 week mental/physical state

Smoked for 8 years in my twenties, quit for 4 years cold, had a "life backflip" and smoked for the past 4 years - Just quit 4 weeks ago.  Doing my best to recall how I felt the last time I quit, mostly to remember the timeline regarding my physical and mental state for my own piece of mind.  Physically I'm starting to notice that my lungs feel congested after feeling great right after I quit.  Mentally I feel a bit low, a little indecisive and unmotivated.  Anyone want to share what month two brought them?  

Favorable replies if you don't mind,  I don't think its encouraging for those trying to quit to hear how hard it is.  I'm never smoking again,  I feel great about it, and it really hasn't been difficult thus far.  Just looking for positive expectation advice.

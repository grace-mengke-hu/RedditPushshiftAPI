Just hit one week after 13 years of a pack a day!

This is the second time I've attempted to quit and so far this one is going way easier.  I keep Allen Carr's book with me everywhere I go and just read a paragraph or two when I really feel the cravings.  Other than that I just keep reminding myself of the benefits of quitting and distract myself with video games.  A lot of video games.  I subscribed to this sub a while back when I first tried to quit and never unsubscribed knowing I would make another attempt one day.  Have these posts pop up on my front page now and then really helped.  Thanks!

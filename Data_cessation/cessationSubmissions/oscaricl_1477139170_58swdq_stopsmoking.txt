yesterday's doctors appointment

Got the flu so I had go see a doctor yesterday. I recently moved to a different place, so as a new patient I told him my medical history. Then there came this obligatory question "Are you a smoker or non-smoker?" At least in my country that always comes up... and I always felt bad. It always used to be some guilt-ridden "hmm, yah" because I already knew next thing to come was the doctor's mentioning of the bad health effects. As if there exists a single smoker who doesn't know about that.   

Luckily for me, this time was different. I said "non-smoker". And I smilingly added "since May 12th, to be precise". 
Doctor laughed and that's what he exactly typed into my medical history in his database: "Patient YX, nonsmoker since 12.5.2016."

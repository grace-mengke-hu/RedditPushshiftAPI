One week smoke free and easily agitated - ended up in the jail because of it. 

I decided to quit smoking on new year eve, so far so good. The only problem is that since I quit smoking I notice that I get easily agitated. Two days ago I got in a agrument with this guy in a pub and I ended up beating the shit out of him. The police arrested me, threw me in jail and now I'm facing a 1200$ fine. At least now I can't afford to smoke.

One year smoke free!!

It got way easier after the two week mark. Went from a pack a day to a year of no cigarettes! I don't dip or vape; I do enjoy a cigar about 3 times a year or so.

For those having a hard time or are worried about embarking on this journey, do it now and keep it up!! Your families will be thankful, and that's what it's all about!

The day before my quit date I had an eye opening interaction.

My quit date was yesterday. The night before I had plans to go out with a friend, who is quitting with me, one final smoker blow out. I stopped that morning and bought a pack. I went to that store a lot, so I know the guy. I told him it was my last pack. He tried to explain to me his father smoked until he was 78 with no averse effects, and his trainee said "we will be right here when you come back to it". An angry light bulb went off in my head. Smoking is a cult, and I am too smart to be in a cult. It cemented my belief I could do this, and I will. I keep repeating "why would I want a smoke, I'm not a smoker", and more importantly "I don't do cults".

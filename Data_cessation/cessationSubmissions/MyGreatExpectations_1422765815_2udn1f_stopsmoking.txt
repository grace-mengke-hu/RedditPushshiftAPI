New to the community, thought the support would help on the reboot of my quit.

3 weeks ago i decided i was done with smoking, i was done with being a slave to one bad and self destructive decision I made 13 years ago, and i was done with always finding a reason to quit later!

I bought a hypnosis app, and I quit; sort of.  Mostly it was fairly easy, the breathing techniques worked to dispel most cravings, but for some reason I couldn't get passed that one cigarette at night. 
 I am well aware that there is no such thing as just one cigarette, so here I am 3 weeks later still a smoker and very mad at myself for it!  I've never been one to reach out for much of anything, but hey, I haven't won this battle solo, guess its time for some help.

I now put in writing.  FEB 1 2015 will be my first 100% smoke free day!

Post for some motivation....

Morning Non-Smokers

I'm only on day nine but wanted to make a post with some benefits I've experienced so far to keep myself motivated and hopefully some of you guys too. I was smoking about 20+ a day so I've felt some pretty immediate effects from going cold turkey.

1. Breath no longer stinks and teeth starting to loom better.
2. Getting more done at work as I'm wasting ten minutes out of every hour.
3. My cardio training has improved dramatically.
4. No longer feeling light headed during Dead lifting and squats.
5. Skin feels better. 
6. Feel more energy. 
7. Sex is starting to feel better. I think maybe this is down nerve endings growing back. 
8. I don't taste like an ashtray (more a benefit for others but still)
9. Feel more self respect. 
10.  No longer wasting all my hard work I put into my otherwise healthy lifestyle.
11. Saved (stopped wasting) about Â£70
12. Feel like I can focus more

What are some benefits you guys have noticed since stopping?

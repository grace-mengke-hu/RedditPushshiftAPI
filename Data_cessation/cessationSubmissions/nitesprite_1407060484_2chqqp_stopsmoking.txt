Thrilled I found this sub and going for support

I have smoked, off and on, for over half my life. Wow... I feel ancient! I started smoking at 13-14 and quit again at 23, for seven years. I started smoking again for a horrible, idiotic reason and haven't stopped. I have tried gum, patches and now I'm trying vaping. For me, the ritual of going outside to smoke is key. I get bored - I smoke. I feel stressed - I go to the porch. I desperately want to just STOP, but I keep falling back on old habits. Smoking has become my automatic response to, well, pretty much everything. Any advice for a smoker/quitter/smoker?

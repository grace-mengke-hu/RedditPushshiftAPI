Quitting today for my pup

Hey guys, new here. Just got home from the vet after finding out that the skin/breathing problems my pup is having are probably caused by my smoking. I was super upset and just wanted a cigarette.. guess that’s the dependency kicking in. 

Anyway, I only had 1 left and ended up feeling like shit that what I’m doing is harmful to her so I threw it out and downloaded the smoke free app. 

I mostly lurk on Reddit but figured if there was ever a time/place to start being more active, it’d be here and now. You’re all such an inspiration. Wish me luck!

About to Hit a Year ... But

I miss the lie of smoking.  No, I don't miss the byproducts of smoking.  But I would be lying if I said I do not miss the lie some days.  Every day I am surrounded by smokers.  Multiple people who work for me ; they have a camaraderie I used to have.  I miss that.  That lie.

I'm not smoking, have not cheated, never bought a pack, etc but I do miss the lie sometimes ... like right this minute.

Yes, I know I will live longer, have a better "quality" of life, and be more desirable [less detestable] to those around me.  But the truth is I am an old due anyway.  And I wonder if it really matters.  If the lie is the truth.

Don't want to be a downer to those who are quitting.  Quitting is the right thing to do and why I did it.  That is the truth.  It is right for you too.  But, the lie that cig fed[s] me is over there, somewhere, whispering it is the truth.  I fucking hate that I still love the lie.

Stay strong everyone.

In a couple hours I officially start my first quit day.

Today is my quit day. I chose against starting out first thing in the morning and instead set the quit time to noon(which is naptime). I have been a smoiker for 12 years, and have attempted to quit many times but always found excuses to start back up. 

I'm finally taking control of my life and getting healthy. I'm losing weight, eating better and exercising daily along with keeping a regular sleep cycle. I finally feel I have the tools and ability to manage my anxiety etc without smoking. 

I'm posting here because I need some encouragement. It's frightening to give up something that's been like a life line for so many years.

I have a ton of nicotine patches but I'm unsure if I should go cold turkey or use the patches. Y'all think it would be fine to try cold turkey and if it's to hard on me to slap on a patch and taper it down?

What can I do to check myself before I wreck myself?

I work in customer service. Made it a week cold-turkey. I once possessed the patience of the biblical Job. I don't know where it went. I think that maybe my brain misses nicotine. Please advise, I'm afraid I will say the wrong thing to the wrong person without even realizing it!!!

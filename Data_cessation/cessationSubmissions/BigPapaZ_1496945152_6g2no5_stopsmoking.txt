All or nothing. Healthy habits.

So I have quit a few times before and lasted up to 3 months.

I am currently a month into quitting and I plan on never smoking again.  I have combined my quit with a few other healthy changes like regularly exercising and eating a new, healthy diet.  I've lost 14lbs since and feel amazing.  That's why I'm posting this now, while I'm feeling confident and healthy.

Here's my issue.  I have had successful stretches in the past.  I've eaten healthy, quit the cigarettes, and exercised and felt great for periods of a few months.  But then something happens.  I may have a rough week of work, I may have a party weekend with some friends, or I may just have some urge that I don't fight off.  

It always happens the same way.  One of the habits goes, and then they all crumble.  Maybe I work out 4x / week for a few months and start getting into shape.  Then one crazy week comes along where I don't work out for some reason and then the next thing I know I'm eating like crap and smoking cigarettes for the next month or two.

With cigarettes I never want to smoke again for the rest of my life.  But with exercise and eating healthy, of course I won't be a perfect eater/exerciser every week of my life.  I will have another beer or ice cream at times in my life and that's okay for me. But I just feel like one week of bad diet leads me on unhealthy roads that end up with cigarettes when I just say "fuck it, I'm unhealthy again".

Any advice on these cycles?  I feel like I can't fall off any of my wagons or they all crash down.  is anyone else the same?

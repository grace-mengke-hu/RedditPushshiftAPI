I got drunk and fucked up bad

i rolled and smoked 2 cigarettes after 2 weeks of not smoking anything. i feel dumb but i the same time i'm justifying it my the fact i'm only 19 and have some time until i can wisen up, i want to be able to make my mistakes until i can really be "grown up" and reasonable. i'm really lost. what do i do?

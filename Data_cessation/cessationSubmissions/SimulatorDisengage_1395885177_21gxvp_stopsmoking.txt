Day 3, I'm in a bad way.

So I just got off work. It was my first shift since quitting. It took everything I had to resist. I bartend, I watch people smoke all day. There's a convenience store right next door that's a little too convenient for cigs. It was slow. ( I smoke when I'm bored) I almost broke many times. After I left I almost stopped at the gas station for a pack. Instead I drove to another bar. I'm having a drink right now, and I was planning on bumming a smoke from someone. I rationalized it somehow. But as I'm typing this the craving is subsiding. I think I'm going to make it. I have to. Thanks for listening to me rant.

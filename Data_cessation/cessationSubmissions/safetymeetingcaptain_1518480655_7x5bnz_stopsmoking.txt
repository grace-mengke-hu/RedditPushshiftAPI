I've got a case of the Mondays but I didn't smoke!

Some days can be a real pain in the ass. Old me would have smoked half a pack by now. New me hasn't had a single bit of nicotine since last year. Feels good, man.

'scuse me for going of topic, but I need to vent... WTF KIMBERLY?!? WHAT'S YOUR DEAL!? LEAVE MY DEPT, MY TEAM AND MY BUDGET ALONE!

Do you guys completely reset the clock when you cave?

Hi y'all, I've been struggling to quit this entire year, my trend has been to make it two weeks cave when drinking and REPEAT, I recently made it 20 days then caved and had a few on a (you guessed it!) a night out. I'm feeling really demoralized and disappointed in myself, I haven't smoked since, but I'm wondering do you completely reset your clock when you lapse or do you let it just edit itself appropriately for the amount of cigarettes you've smoked? Does it matter!?

Thank you in advance from someone who is feeling pretty damn guilty right now.

Cheers!

Experiences with Chantix?

First time posting here :) I set a quit date a couple weeks from now, and felt like I wanted to try Chantix. I’ve tried quitting cold turkey a few times and never been successful for more than a few weeks. I’ve been smoking for nearly 20 years now and have eliminated one of my major triggers, which is drinking. That’s usually what’s caused me to pick up a cigarette when I’ve tried quitting in the past. I’ve been sober for nearly 6 months now. 

I have a prescription for Chantix,  but pretty scared to try it due to some of the potential side effects. I do have a history of depression, panic attacks, and anxiety. The doctor seemed unconcerned about me trying it, saying that I can just stop if I experience side effects, but that they are rare. 

Anyone tried it and, if so, how did it go?

Day 4, cold turkey. Flu-like aches. Is this normal?

It's tricky to explain but you know how you get sort of achy when you come down with a cold or flu? I quit 4 days ago and this started just last night along with a rough-feeling throat. 

Being a super hypochondriac, a bit of peace of mind would be a tremendous help.

One day in, please help

This has been one hell of a day. Last cig was last night. Woke up this morning feeling okay, but started to get lightheaded once I got into work. Since then I've felt dizzy, tired, restless, hungry, mad, and now I'm randomly in tears. 

I know I want to do this and finally not be a smoker. I don't even necessarily want a cigarette to be honest, I just want these crazy mood swings to go away. 

I have Allen Carr's book at home, I'm almost halfway through. Is there anything I can do to make all this stop? I'm so mad at myself for letting myself get to this point in the first place. My bf thinks I should try nicotine patches, but I don't think that'll solve the problem. 

How long will this last? I feel like I'm going insane :(

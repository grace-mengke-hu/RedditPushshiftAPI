Half a year smoke free!

I've gone from smoking for half of my life to now not having a cigarette in 6 months. I still have the odd craving that will last for a couple of seconds, but it goes away and I don't crave for days or weeks. Overall, I don't even think about smoking anymore. I've quit smoking so many times in my life, but have never done this well. I'd always sneak a smoke in here and there. I guess this time I really mean it. I'm not a smoker anymore!

I'm smoking my last cigarette now.. I'm a chronic quitter in need of advice.

Every time I buy a pack I tell myself it's the last pack. Honestly when I finish my last cigarette of the pack the best I can do is almost a full day without smoking. I'm only 19 and I smoke about a pack a day. And I have since I was about 15. I'm tired of being a slave to cigarettes. I just want to be healthy. But I feel like I have almost no self control. If the craving gets bad enough I'll just buy a pack and convince myself it's the last pack or I'm only gonna smoke a few..What do you guys do when you're about to buy another pack that convinces you not to?

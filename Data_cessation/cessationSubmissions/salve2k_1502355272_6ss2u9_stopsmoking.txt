Natural nicotine/tabacco replacement

Hi, did you ever wonder if there is any herbal/etc. replacement for nicotine? I stopped smoking with Allen Carr's method and try to find something instead of smoking (if there is anything like that). I do not mean any nicotine derivative like pills or patches. Just pure natural something that is similiar to nicotine puff's dopamine feeling (especially the first morning one - you know what I am talking about if you were smoker).

This was my 3rd weekend. I had a beer and didn't feel like smoking a pack.

It was easier than I thought.

**Before:**

* If I drank a beer I always had to have a smoke
* If I had a meal I had to have a smoke. 

**Saturday night:** I decided to break my no drinking rule and have a beer. (I you had seen the hamburger I ordered you would have ordered a beer too)

This was something that I thought was going to give me a huge craving(s), but I honestly felt nothing until I got to my apartment and boredom kicked in. This was amazing, I had a hamburger, a beer and for a while after that I didn't think about cigarettes. I guess good company really makes a difference. And it was a strong 9% beer ;)

Then I remembered [this video about addictions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao8L-0nSYzg). 
Worth the watch if you haven't seen it. Links addictions with lack of connections in your life.

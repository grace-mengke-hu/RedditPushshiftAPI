1/3 of a Year

It's been a third of a year. It really has flown by. Anyone who has been here for the last four months knows, mine was a tough quit. The first month was never ending and the first 1/3 year flew by.

Lots of changes. I didn't just take control of my smoking habit, I took control of other parts of my life.

* I quit my job. I got another job.
* I almost quit my husband, but decided to keep him.
* I got my new drivers licence (new country) and my new (to me) car arrives tomorrow. (I HAVE SO EARNED IT!)
* I took up new hobbies.
* I no longer live my life around my husband's needs. I am also important.

I learned that I deserve to happy and healthy. It's a work in progress.
But...did I mention I get a car tomorrow!?!? Feeling kinda broke after buying a car, but she's really pretty.

That is all.

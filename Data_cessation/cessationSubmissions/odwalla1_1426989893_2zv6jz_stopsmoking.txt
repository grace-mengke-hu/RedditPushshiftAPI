Sunday is the day!

I quit smoking last May for a few months when I found out I was pregnant, then picked the habit back up after the loss of my daughter in September.  

I have set several quit dates over the past month or so, but when the time comes, I just blow it off.  Being pregnant gave me the best motivation to quit, but I want to succeed and be completely nicotine free BEFORE I try to conceive again.

I am posting this partly because I want to hold myself to my quit date tomorrow, and also because I would love any advice, encouragement, tips & tricks or anything that anyone has to offer!

I'm excited (and also dreading) the idea of eventually being a "non-smoker"!

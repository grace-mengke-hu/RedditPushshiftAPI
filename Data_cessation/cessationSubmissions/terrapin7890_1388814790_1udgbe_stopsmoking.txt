Quitting cigarettes, the good and the bad.

For the last five years I've smoked anywhere from 1/2-2 packs a day, I have finally arrived to the point where I absolutely detest myself for ever smoking to begin with.  
For my own personal sake, I have decided to make a list of the pros and cons of smoking cigarettes.  
Benefits of continuing to smoke cigarettes: Information not found.
Benefits of quitting: More money, better health, better self-esteem, increased self-discipline, restoration of senses, won't face the public world's judging eye, and I will smell like a basket of flowers.
I'm going to come back to this post in three days without so much as a puff of a cigarette so until then, wish me luck!

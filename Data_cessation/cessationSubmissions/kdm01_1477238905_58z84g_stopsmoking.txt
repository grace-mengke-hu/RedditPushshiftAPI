My quit date is November 1st!

I've been smoking since I was 13 and I'm 26 now. I need to quit for my babies and for me! 

I've been reading all of the stories and updates on here and it is really motivating me, so thank you everyone. 

I planned to go cold turkey but now I'm thinking about picking up an e-cigarette.

Any and all tips welcome! 

This is my first Reddit post and I'm sure I messed it up somehow lol..

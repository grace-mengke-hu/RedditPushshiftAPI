So tomorrow is the day

I stopped smoking before, with the help of nicotine patches, and I was smoke free for about 1.5 years. I think one of the mistakes I made, was quitting with my friend together, and when I found out he started smoking again, I got upset and I relapsed. This time it's different. I want to try cold turkey, but I have two things I want to be part of my plan:

1: to keep me focused on my goal I'll put the money aside every time I would've bought a pack,  and 

2: to keep my hands busy, I'll eat carrots. 

I feel that sharing this here helps my commitment to pull it off. So thanks for reading :-)

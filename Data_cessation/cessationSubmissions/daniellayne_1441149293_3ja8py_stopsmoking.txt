I have a bit of a stupid question: are the effects of smoking permanent?

I'm 20 and I've been smoking for about 3 years now. My problem is I'm a serious chain smoker. I mean 2-3 packs a day. And I decided enough is enough. My biggest worry is... Will my body ever recover enough where I'd feel like I never smoked before? Or are these effects permanent?

I'm ashamed of myself

I picked up a bad habit (smoking) in October when my grandma has a stroke and later died. I used to smoke years ago, but quit for over 8 years prior to this. I know I should quit, but I don't know where to find the motivation because something is different about it this time. It feels like a coping mechanism. I feel like I don't care, but I do. 8 years ago I was really determined to quit and did it cold turkey. I just can't stop for some reason.

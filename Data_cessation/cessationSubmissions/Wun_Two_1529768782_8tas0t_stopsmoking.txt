Went from smoking weed to vaping to quitting thc to breaking my nicotine vape.

I’ve smoked a handful of cigs , mainly spliff a couple years ago but i used the worst tobacco I could find and didn’t get too addicted can’t remember why i stopped but I’m happy i did. I’ve been vaping nicotine pretty hard for about 3 1/2 years or so, do you think the withdrawl is easier for someone who actually developed the habit on ecig alone? I’m worried not so much about the short term pain but the long term craving, like taking walks and exploring new cities is a huge part of my life and a big part of that was finding places to vape. I quit because of rib cage pain by what I think was acid reflux and that’s already %80 better so i think that will be able to keep me going alone. I was pissed off weeks before I even thought of starting to quit, so the next day I woke up earlier and had a much better morning then i was feeling pretty good so it dawned on me that I won’t know how I’ll feel in a different situation until i experience it, so I’m holding out hope this will be like that as well. 

9 days off of weed, 2 off of nicotine

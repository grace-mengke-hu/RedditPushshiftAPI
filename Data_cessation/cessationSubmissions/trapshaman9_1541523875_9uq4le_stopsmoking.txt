I have been 5 days without a smoke. Intense craving happening right now.

How can I curve my craving? It feels like there's a little person in my head trying to light up a cigarette. I feel so much better after I've taken these days off from the old tobacco. My breathing and energy is getting back to normal. Some support and insight would be super appreciated.

27 Years Smoking - 1 Full Year Quit

Welp, I did it.  Now, 365 days after joining reddit and posting about how I am going to quit cigarettes, I have made it a full year without even a single puff.  I did it cold turkey after a pack a day for 27 years; I just stopped. Today is day 365. If you asked, I would tell you I am a smoker who is trying to quit.  I don't feel like a nonsmoker, yet I would absolutely not consider returning to smoking, even for a puff or anything.  Its not an option.

Living with those 2 fulltime smokers really ended up being a supreme motivation.  Like living in a zoo thats running nicotine addition experiments where I can see firsthand how bad these things have got people.

I still occasionally think about smoking ciggies, but on top of all the reasons I've used so far to not smoke I also have "well you've come this far not smoking, don't throw that all away for something you know is terrible".  The quit itself helps me stayed quit.  People smoking in front of a bar or on the street makes me feel gross, and sad for them.  The smell is a total turn off.

I feel so much better.  I'm not longer coughing up big lungies with black chunks floating in them.  I can sing with what feels like 40% more air.  I can sing on one breath longer and louder, to a very noticeable and tangible degree.  

I also have $4,000 more in my pocket than  I did paying through the nose for those things.  I didn't save it, or put $11 a day in a jar, but I know I didn't buy ~$4000 of cigarettes this year, and that makes me happy.

All in all I found it a zillion times easier than I ever imagined it could be.  I felt like ciggies were as much a part of my life as water.  Imagine being told you can't ever have a glass of water for the rest of your life?  Thats how scary quitting smoking was for me.  Turns out it was pretty much a cakewalk; I should've done this years ago!  Maybe I just wanted it to be easy, ya know? The mind plays such a powerful role in addiction.  

I hope everyone here is able to stay quit, however you can.  Its really worth it.

I quit 9 days ago (after 12 years of every day smoking).

I have been a smoker for 12 years, without any kind of break. I set my quit date in advance and acknowledged my last pack and cigarette. The first day was a bit weird, but after this it went quite smooth. I did not try to break any other habits I had associated with smoking( coffee, alcohol). I still hang out with smokers and go out. I think it's important to separate these, they don't necessarily go hand in hand. I will delete the app from my phone when I (hopefully) reach 60 days. Why? Non-smokers don't have an app on their phone telling tracking their progress. They just don't smoke and that's it. Good luck to all of you out there trying to break this nasty habit!

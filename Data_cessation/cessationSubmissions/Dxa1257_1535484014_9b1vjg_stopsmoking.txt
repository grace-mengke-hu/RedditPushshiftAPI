One tough day.

Today was a really tough day for me.

I couldnt sleep last night due to some problems at home, couldnt focus on work today and get no work done.The triggers kept coming my way but kept reasoning myself. Also one post on this sub today had made a deep impact on me.

Finally i just got on my motorcycle, went for a short ride and then did a bit of maintenance job on it to calm myself down.

Pretty happy that i didnt cave in and made sure to keep my [progress](https://i.imgur.com/Fb7McDe.png) intact.

Thanks to all on this sub, keep sharing.

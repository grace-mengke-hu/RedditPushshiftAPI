One month in, and feeling pretty good!

(My first post is [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/1bd8mq/stopping_this_morning/).)

My last cigarette was at 3am on March 31st, a few hours before I had breakfast with my friend and told him I was quitting. I still have dreams -- I guess I'd call them nightmares at this point? -- where I accept a cigarette from someone. When I wake up, I still have trouble believing that I actually, finally quit. My friends and family are proud, but most importantly, I'm proud of myself.

I had an e-cigarette I was puffing on and off for the first two weeks, but eventually stopped those too. I've also been involved with a girl for the past month who doesn't approve of smoking. I didn't quit for her -- I quit for myself [and everyone who has to be around me] -- but I don't smoke around people who don't like it, so having spent so much time around her for the past 32 days really helped.

I still get cravings, but they're so much easier to ignore now. I can stand outside with my friends at the bars while they're smoking, and I don't even bat an eye. It's empowering.

I've been using the QuitNow! app the entire time. If I were still a smoker, then from March 31st until now, I would have:
* smoked about 575 cigarettes,
* spent about $145 on packs, and
* wasted a total of about 2 days and 9 hours with the act of smoking by itself.

I literally quit on a complete whim, and it's worked so well. The easy part is saying to yourself, "There's no time like the present!" The hard part is taking yourself seriously.

But it's so worth it. Sorry for the long post, but I hope I can serve as an inspiration for someone out there trying to quit. Keep at it!

Gonna try this again.

I’m pretty sure I’ve posted before. So far all other attempts to quit have been total failures. However, it’s starting to really suck. I smell nasty all the time and I’ve had this cough since I got sick weeks ago. 

Right now I see two big hurdles. But I actually have plans for these. 

1. Smoking and driving go hand in hand in my eyes, and I drive a lot. I’m going to replace cigarettes with maybe drinking water? I feel like I need to do more of that anyways.

2. My job. It’s become incredibly stressful and I never know what else to do on my breaks. I was hoping you guys might have some recommendations for apps or games I could waste time on when I’m on a break or lunch. Just something to keep me distracted. 

I’m using one of the apps I see here to help motivate and I feel like I may have finally smoked my last cigarette. I feel like if I pull this off, it’ll help my life improve.

Wish me luck guys.

Just checking in

Hey guys.  Five days in and feeling okay.  I've had nicotine, though, in the form of some nicotine gum from a previous quitting attempt, but I'm not letting that get me down.

More importantly, I had an evaluation for alcohol abuse today, and surprise surprise, turns out I'm dependent on alcohol.  I'm going to be getting some further counseling over the next few weeks, but for now I'm on a sort of experimental plan to limit myself to 2 drinking nights this week, 3 drinks per night and 1 drink per hour.  I'm going to try to drink just one night, though, just to prove to myself that I can do it.  

I'm trying to get back into some good habits I used to have: regular exercise, meditation, playing my guitar, etc., and I'm really trying to get my "high" off the little things in life. Just now right after a meditation session my gf texted me to tell me she got an A on her test.  I want things like THAT to make me happy, not booze or nicotine. 

Anyway, sorry to go off on all these non-smoking-related things, but I just wanted to encourage you guys to take this period of quitting as an opportunity to think about other positive changes you can make in your life.  Good luck everyone!

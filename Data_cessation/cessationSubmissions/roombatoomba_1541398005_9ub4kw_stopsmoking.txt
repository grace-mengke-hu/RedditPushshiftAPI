How to quit smoking and keep the thinking moments?

I work from home and after I finished a hard task or if I need to do some heavy thinking I go to the balcony and smoke. And while I'm there smoking I usually find great solutions to problems I'm facing. It's a great time that I have between me, myself and I, where my mind finally stops rushing and I can see the bigger picture and come up with new ideas. It also works like this when I'm walking alone on the street thinking about my problems. 
Besides, smoking is a way to control my anxiety and my habits of biting things, pulling my beard or my hair, etc.

Truth is, that's what I like about cigarettes. I hate the smell, the habit, the possible consequences and the constant thought of getting cancer and not being able to do everything I've planned for the future.

I constantly see tips like "drink water, eat healthier and exercise" but that won't help me during the day. It will reduce my anxiety and help me forget about cigarettes, but I'll still miss those moments. This was what made me go back twice. 

What could I do to replace cigarettes and still keep having these moments?

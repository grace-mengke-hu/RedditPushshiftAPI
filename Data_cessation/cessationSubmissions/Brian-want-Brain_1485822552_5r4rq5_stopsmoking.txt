Two months without a cigarette, but I still have cravings after eating.

I'm happy with my progress, in fact, i don't even have carvings anymore! Expect after I finish eating.  
  
Tell me wise redditors, what is the best way to deal with it? I absolutely do not feel like its getting easier to ignorethis specific carving since my second week or so.

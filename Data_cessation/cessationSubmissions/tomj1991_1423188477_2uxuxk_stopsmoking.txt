I'm on day 3, and it's horrible.

I've made it to my 3rd day smoke free a few hours ago and holy hell do I want a ciggy, my mind is giving me all these ways on how it will be OK to have one, but I know it's not and I know if I have that one these three days are wasted.

Will I crave like this for a while? If so I don't know if I can keep it up. I know I sound childish but it really does feel that bad for me.

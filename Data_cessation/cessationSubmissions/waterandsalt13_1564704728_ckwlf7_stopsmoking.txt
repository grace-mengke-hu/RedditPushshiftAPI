Barghhggg!

It’s day two. Feels like it’s been a month. Lol. Leading up to this the days went fast and now it seems as though time has slowed down! Went to a friends tonight after staying in the past two days to avoid any triggers or stressful situations. Had a beer and then decided to get cocky and pick up a half smoke left on the picnic table to brag about how it’s not even tempting me. People suck sometimes though, my bf was all “smoke it” and his friend actually did. Bah! I’m like no it’s gross I don’t want it. He’s all “it’s sooo good..” on and on. I don’t get why they have to be like that instead of being supportive. They think they’re being funny but it’s so annoying. I ended up stealing one puff and walked away feeling dizzy and gross and guilty. It reminded me how disgusting it is but also has made the cravings more intense the past hour or two. Maybe I’ll stay home for the next two weeks and remind my bf not to be a dick... lol... ugh

Is it alright if I could just smoke 1-2 sticks just for today?

I'm almost on my 3rd month and IM really really craving. I never thought this would actually happen after quitting for such a long time. No one told me about this. Is such rebound even possible? I also have to take in the fact that I broke down crying twice last week after getting so drunk. I'm stressed out and I feel like smoking would actually calm me down. It's my stress reliever. 

What do you guys recommend? 


Edit: WOW THANK YOU GUYS SO MUCH. I can't express how grateful I am to have you guys in one of the darkest days of my life.

I don't know if what I've been doing the past few days is connected to my suffering right now. I've been smoking a lot of dabs. I would basically smoke every lunch, and late evening with my friends. I started to crave for sweets... LOTS of sweets. I was into such a frenzy that I even started eating icing sugar. This just dawned on me today.


 ANYWAYS, REALLY THANK YOU GUYS SO MUCH! I can't imagine what I would've done a few hours ago if I didn't get to read all your comments. I REALLY APPRECIATE EVERYTHING, even the slightest gestures. This reddit page is reallly really awesome

In need of support

So after making my first post on this subreddit, I have quit. Its been 5 days since I've last smoked and damn it feels good. These past 5 days I've kept myself really busy, and I'd been exercising everyday to remind myself why I want to quit. I'm really nervous because I'm about to go hangout with my cigarette-smoking friends and I'm afraid the temptation will get to me. Even now, I can already feel how much I want a cigarette. Being surrounded by the smell and watching other people enjoy a cigarette will probably be enough to break me. The simple solution would be to not hangout with them but they are good friends and I can't avoid them forever. 

Any tips to get me through a night of hanging out with cigarette smoking friends?

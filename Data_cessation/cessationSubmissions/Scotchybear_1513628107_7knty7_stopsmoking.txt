13 days without nicotine!

I'm almost to the big 2 week mark! It hasn't been easy though. My cat went missing about 4 days ago and that took my anxiety to the next level!

It had me feeling depressed and freaked me out that I was going crazy I felt so bad. But it has gotten better slowly but surely.

Today isn't the best day, I'm feeling really on edge and kinda derealized. But I know I'll get through it. Stay strong guys!

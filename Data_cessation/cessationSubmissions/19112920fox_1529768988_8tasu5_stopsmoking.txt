How do I avoid over eating?

Today is day 78 for me cold turkey.
I'm pretty proud of myself so far, and my cravings are fewer and further between.

The only thing I hate is the weight gain. I've always had self control problems and without the nicotine I feel as if I am never full for more than a few minutes.
When I eat a meal it's usually a large portion. Shortly after that I want to eat again. I've increased my workouts since noticing the gain, but I would really appreciate any advice to help curb my increased appetite.

First month down

I havent been a daily smoker for years, and would only go through a couple of packs a month. Mainly smoking on weekends, vacation, social situations, but i would go sometimes for weeks without needing one.  Now that I've told myself I'm not doing it anymore, i get real cravings to have one, especially on Thursday knowing the weekend is coming. My biggest problem is getting past the ritualistic part of going out side to break up time at a bar, or friends. Or just going outside to enjoy the weather.  I've been trying to go out with friends while they smoke, but if i get too drunk i know i will cave at some point.  I also have a vacation to Vegas in April, that I'm super stressed about hoping by then it wont be a thing lol.   Here's to keep on keeping on...

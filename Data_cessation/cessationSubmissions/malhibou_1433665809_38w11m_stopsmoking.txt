Re-setting my badge :(

Spent a hellish day apartment-hunting in a new city and resisted every opportunity to smoke. Got cocky with it, had a few drinks (which I hadn't done since I'd quit smoking last week) and, well... Let's get this badge back down to zero.

I'm so disappointed in myself. My head is killing me, my throat feels like shit, and I can't stop crying. This just proves that I need to stay vigilant. I know I don't know any of you, but I want to apologize to you guys anyway. Thanks for the support you gave me in my first week. I'm going to keep coming back to read your inspirational posts in my second-first-week.

I've Been Putting This Post Off Because I'm Scared

So I've lurked here awhile and even posted a couple months ago, ready to finally quit (I made it less than a week). 

But things have changed in the last two weeks. After dealing with a hoarse voice for a few months I finally went to see an ENT. They found that I had a growth on my vocal cords. Doctor said it looks like scar tissue and is almost certainly benign. 

Most likely I injured it yelling or screaming (probably during one of the summer concerts I attended) and then it was unable to heal properly between smoking (cigs and weed), drinking, and work (I wait tables in a busy restaurant, so I'm speaking loudly for 4-6 hrs a night, 5 nights a week). 

So tomorrow morning I'm having surgery to remove the growth. In order to let it heal properly I am taking two weeks off work (at a big loss of income), but more importantly quitting smoking and drinking. Oh and coffee, for at least a few weeks. 

I'll quit cigarettes forever. I'll probably bring back weed after the New Year but only for special occasions. Drinking will probably come back after the New Year as well, although to a significantly more moderate degree. 

To be completely honest, I'm scared. For the better part of a decade I've had all four of these drugs in my life on an almost daily basis, and I can't think of more than a couple days I've gone without at least one of them. And here I am, about to quit all four cold turkey. 

I'll definitely be checking back in this sub regularly for support. Thanks guys. You're all pretty awesome and your encouragement is much appreciated.

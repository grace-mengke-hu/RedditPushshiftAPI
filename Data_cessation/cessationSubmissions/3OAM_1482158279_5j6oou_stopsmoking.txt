Quitting smoking during a rough part of my year

I've been going through a break up–if you can even call it that–and there have been SO many times I've wanted to just buy a pack and chill the fuck out, but somehow I made it 30 days.

Being able to identify and resist the urge to blame returning to smoking on emotional pain is a really, really valuable skill. I might not have had that strength at day 5 or day 6, but its getting easier.

I'm so glad I found this subreddit. You guys make me feel like I'm not alone, even though this is the most alone I've felt in years.

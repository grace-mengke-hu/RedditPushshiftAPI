Currently debating whether to buy a pack of smokes with my last $20.

I'm 38. I've smoked since I was 15. Had about 3 months of not smoking at 29 after reading Alan Carr. I'm broke, and it feels like I smoke even more as I have heaps of spare time not working.

I really want to stop. I just cave every time and buy more smokes.

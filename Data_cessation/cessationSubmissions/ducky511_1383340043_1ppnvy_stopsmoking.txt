First week!

Its been a week so far. 7 days smoke free. The cravings are going way down. Honestly the biggest help has been chewing gum (dubble bubble!) And the day counter on my phone. I have tried to quite so many times in the past, this time I think my heart is actually in it. This subreddit has been amazingly helpful too. Just seeing so many people succeeding has been a big help. Thank you all so much!

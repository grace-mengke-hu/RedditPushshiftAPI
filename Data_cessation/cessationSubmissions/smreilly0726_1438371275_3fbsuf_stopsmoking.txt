Quitting & commuting tips?

I've been smoke free for over a month now and it was going so great. I came up with really helpful methods of riding the cravings out by distracting myself. Two weeks ago I started a temporary commute that is 2.5 hours each way. The cravings shot right back midway into week one & they're getting stronger the longer I sit in traffic, then disappear when I'm out of the car. I'm having issues distracting myself in such a tiny space for so long. I've tried tons of iced coffees/teas/snacks/music/podcasts.

Does anyone have any advice on remaining smoke free during long commutes in traffic?

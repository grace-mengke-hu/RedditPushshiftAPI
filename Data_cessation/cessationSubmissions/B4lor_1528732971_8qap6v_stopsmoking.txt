I need some advice.

So, I'm 20 and have been smoking for 2 years. I'm not a heavy smoker, a pack usualy last for 2 weeks. Lately I'm feeling a slight discomfort on the left side of my back and It's a little hard to breathe than usual. No need to say that I already throw away the last ciggies I had. I'm planing on doing a complete lung check but I just want some personal experiences of you guys. I know smoking is fucking bad for you but I wonder if in such a short time being a ligth smoker I still have a chance of have some kind of serious lung problem or even be in early stage of cancer.


p.s. : english is not my native language so forgive if I made any mistakes

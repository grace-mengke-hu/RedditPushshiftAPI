Want to re-start, any thoughts?

I'll hit a month mark today. Throughout this quit I've never been happy like my other attempts. I think it is because this wasn't planned - I started due to a bad bout of tonsillitis.

Cigarettes are constantly in my mind, I want to just start again and this time with the right mindset. I also start a new job the next week and this in a way is also a new beginning to me. I just want to smoke and then begin again Monday.

What do you think? I'm I being stupid?

Day 3 smoke free, but having lots of issues. Need support/advice

So, today's day 3 without smoking and I feel like I'm losing my mind. I tend to be slightly anxious normally, but yesterday and today both I constantly feel like I'm either going to scream or cry (and have done both a couple times) and I constantly feel like I'm in the midst of a panic attack and like someone's sitting on my chest. Last time I quit, I used chantix so I didn't have any withdrawal symptoms, but this time I'm just going cold turkey. I can't concentrate on anything for more than a minute or two, which I'm sure is evident from this post and I feel like I'm going insane from anxiety. But really, I'd just love to hear some advice or supportive stories from other people to help me get through these next few days or so til the withdrawal part's over. Thanks!

Tl;dr: Cold turkey. Withdrawal symptoms taking serious toll on me. Any advice?

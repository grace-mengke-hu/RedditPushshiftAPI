Almost There

Decided to share a quick story. My name is Lizz and I started smoking cigarettes at age 14, along with using a vape pen at the age of 16. I worked at a gas station, so my coworkers would sell me cigarettes even though I wasn't 18 and my step dad would buy my vape juice for me. I made the decision quit smoking cigarettes all together two months before my 18th birthday and bought my first mod. I will be 20 in October and I made it down to 3mg of nicotine in my vape juice after starting at 18mg. Today I put my vape down for 9 hours and I am so proud of myself. It's hard to believe I've already been smoking for 6 years at 20 years old.

Well I didn't know that smoking could give me THAT kind of cancer. 

[Warning - girl medical stuff here] 

Day one (again) of my non-smoking journey today after having abnormal cells removed from my cervix yesterday - proper surgery, general anaesthic etc. The doctor informed me that the reason they became abnormal so aggressively (I had CIN 3 cells which are just around the corner from full blown cancer, previous Pap smear was totally clear) is because of smoking. Smoking doubles your chance of cervical cancer. Smoking was potentially going to lead me to have cancer of the fajutz and I'm really fond of my fajutz! 

So ladies (and gentlemen who have sisters, mothers, girlfriends, SO, etc) a) let these ladies in your life know that smoking isn't just about lung cancer (I'm fond of my lungs too, but we all know what we're doing is bad for them) and b) tell them to get a Pap smear just to be sure. It's an awkward conversation but the women in my life were also unaware of this risk and a little discomfort can catch something before it gets too scary - like in my case. 

Good luck to you all. We can do this!

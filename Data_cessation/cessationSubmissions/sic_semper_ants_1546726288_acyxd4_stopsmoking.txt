It's 4 PM and I haven't had a cigarette today

I dont know why I suddenly decided this week that I'm going to quit smoking today, but I did. Because of the new year maybe? I'm 29 and I've smoked since I was 15. I'm scared about it for some reason.

Browsing this sub is helpful. Really like seeing the art people make as a distraction. Maybe I'll post some stuff of my own one day. 

Love you guys ‚ù§

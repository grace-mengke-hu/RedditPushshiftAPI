Day One and Smell Again

So I guess I should say why I'm quitting and how I feel about it. I'm hoping you guys can empathize some with what I'm experiencing. 

So the reason I'm quitting for may not entirely be the right one. My medical premiums will jump by at least 50% next year if I don't quit by the end of the month. I cut down drastically and my wife went on Chantix, so she's been smoke free for a week with no problem after about a week of it.

Anyway, I have cut down considerably and my gum intake has gone from none to a lot lol. I cheated and had 1/2 a cigarette out of the last pack I had last night hence the Day One again. I haven't had one before that for 2 days. I don't want to buy anymore as it almost cost me about 200 bucks a month.

The weirdest problem I'm experiencing now is smell. To be honest I never realized how much I didn't smell anything and to be honest I don't like it. That may sound strange to some, I think. My friend who quit last year said that taste comes back next.

I guess I'm rambling a bit, but I'm curious what things may come back. I don't want to walk around with a clothes pin on my nose all the time, but I'm curious how long if at all you guys took to get used to that.

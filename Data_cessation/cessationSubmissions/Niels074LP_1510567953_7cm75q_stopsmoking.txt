Day 13. A New contender arrives.

It is currently day 13/rest of my life of being a non-smoker and a new contender has started fighting my good choice and I was wondering if anyone else has experienced this.

I have a hard time swallowing. From food to water. It's like I am scared, my throat is really dry and it just gets stuck, I start focussing on breathing and its just really odd.

Anyone have any experience with this potential side effect?

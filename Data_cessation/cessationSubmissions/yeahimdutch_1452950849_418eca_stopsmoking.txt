Maybe a bit of unconventional way of quitting but it helped me getting past the 2-3 days easy.

Hey guys! maybe lurkers! 

First off I'm glad you are here, wanting to make a change for the better and I admire that! Keep it up.

Now what I did to get past the first days "easy" is just go and binge drink while smoking so many cigs in one night. That the next day your hang over is that bad you don't even want a cig.

I'm talking about full out chain smoking madness, one after another. I did this and I made the 2 days easy. At day 3 I got a bit of withdrawal but nothing bad.

What also really, really helps is saying: "I QUIT" no "I ATTEMPT to quit" I find this time (my third time) way easier and I have less craving because of this.

Maybe this helps you out, good luck!

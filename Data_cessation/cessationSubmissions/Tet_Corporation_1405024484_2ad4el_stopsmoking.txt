Quitting July 14th - 22 years smoking and OCD

This is it. It's happening on July 14th, and I'm scared. I've been down to around half a pack a day for a couple years, but the time has come. I've been smoking over twenty years. I have OCD that manifests as panic (I take meds and meditate), and have still been using my illness as a reason not to quit. "It's different for me". "I'll go crazy". "I'm going to lose control". These are the excuses I've made to myself over the years. It's time to stop the excuses. I tried the patch once, it gave me auditory hallucinations, as it did not mix well with my meds. Here is my plan this time:  I'm at home with no commitments until the end of August, I've asked my S/O to not make any social plans for us for the next month, and next Monday (or Sunday if I feel extra brave) I'm going cold turkey. I know myself well enough to understand it's all or nothing with me. I could cut back and back, but I'll never quit that way. I have to get a little "Trainspotting" on this bastard habit, just full stop and let the sickness pass through me. I know my normal triggers (coffee, scotch, after meals, anxiety) so I'm cutting the coffee and scotch, can't really ditch eating, and if I could ditch unwanted thoughts and anxiety, well, I would have done so at first sight of the monsters. I'm looking for any advice, feedback or warnings, especially from other OCD/anxiety people. - Cheers

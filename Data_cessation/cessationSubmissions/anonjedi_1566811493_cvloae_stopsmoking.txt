First smoke free hangover

Went a bit nuts yday, but I resisted the temptation and did not smoke. I feel like shit today, but man, what were the hangovers like when I was smoking? People always told me how worse these get when you smoke, but is it true? From my point of view the feelings are identical. Can I at least expect quicker recovery?

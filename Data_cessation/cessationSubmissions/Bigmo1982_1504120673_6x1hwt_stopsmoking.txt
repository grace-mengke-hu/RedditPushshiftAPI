What drove you to your quit?

Hello,

I've been lurking here, and most of reddit, for quite some time and I decided to commit and start an account so that I can join this awesome community.

I've been smoking since since 2006 on and off, but since the last 7 years it's been about a pack a day. All together I would say I have about 10-11 pack years under my belt. I was in the military from 2001-2004 and I didn't smoke at all, even during deployment to Iraq. Afterwards, I went back there for contracting work and I was stupid enough to start smoking at the age of 24 or so to impress this hot chick. I look back to that decision as the stupidest I've made in my life. Actually, no, thinking about it now, the stupidest mistake is the last one I smoked in the long chain stretching all the way back to that remarkable day. And the best decision will be the next one I don't smoke! (That just came to my mind *pats back*)

Anyways, I guess I'm a little scared. After damaging myself for so long, I am always afraid that I've damaged myself too much. I'm always in between health scares and I was wondering what the experiences did you guys have with your own health scares. 

For me, it's the increased sputum production with these brownish specs that I kinda just cough up. It's not a chronic cough, but it just kinda comes up, all sticky. I sometimes get shortness of breath, and I've seen the doctors about the shortness of breath, but he says my readings were normal. 

But what worries me most is circulation. I have noticed spider veins in my feet and legs starting to develop and just a general sense that I'm not getting as much circulation as I should. 

Has anyone else had these experiences, and if not, what experiences did you experience before you felt that you simply HAD to quit?

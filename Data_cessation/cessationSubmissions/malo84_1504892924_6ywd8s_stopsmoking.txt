Seeking Quit Line Advice

So I am currently participating in the Iowa Quite Line. I just had my 2nd phone call. This one was shorter than my first call. My 2nd call consisted of asking me how I'm addressing my triggers. (Side note just quit on Wed). Also talked about my support system, how I feel, and what makes me feel like I need one. (BTW 4 kids, wife, 2 dogs, 5 houses, and 2 jobs....everything :D ) 

So after asking me all of her required questions she asked what I wanted to talk about that might help. I drew a blank; I wasn't expecting that question. I asked her what others talk about and all she said was "All kinds of things".  

So has anyone done a quit line or have any advice on what I should talk about. Not sure what we would discuss that could help me. I really want this to stick this time. I'm 33 and not getting any younger and want to be around for my kids. 

(Also typing is helping me keep my mind busy.)

Thanks!!!

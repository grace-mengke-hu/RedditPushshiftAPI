Eight days in, brain waking up

Well, the first week has already gone by after cold turkey last week. The first three days were just horrible. I was in a bad mood, the physical side of withdrawal was just no fun. Day four and five got better, the habit was still lingering but I started to feel better. Honestly I didn't feel incredible, I was aware of being tired, anxious, bored, lazy, but didn't have a five minute break every hour to distract myself from how I actually feel. That's the biggest difference I have noticed, I am much more aware of myself when I don't dull my brain every hour. Thank you all for posting to this subreddit, reading your stories help!

Risk of relapse from strong emotions

I was hurt very badly emotionally, on Saturday, by someone I thought was or at least would eventually become a very important part of my life. After it happened I fought with myself really hard not to buy a pack of cigarettes for an intense and seemingly long 30 seconds. Luckily I stayed strong. 

Unfortunately I've been really sad about this thing all week, and I've caught myself trying to rationalize smoking anything, even a puff or two on cigar or pipe. I still have my old pipe and some tobacco (that is probably really stale). I don't think I'll do it, but this event has definitely weakened my resolve for the time being.

I guess I just need a little support. I also want to warn my fellow quitters about emotional vulnerability. Especially if you're early on in your quit, be careful. No one is worth destroying the hard work you've done in kicking your addiction whether it has been an hour or a year or 10 years.

If you're going through a tough time right now, keep your chin up. Things will get better with time whether you smoke or not. Even though it seems like it could, smoking won't make the bad time any easier to deal with. If you can stay off the cancer sticks through it, your resolve to stay off them in good times will be that much stronger.

Thanks for all your help over the last 306 days. Here's to my next 306.

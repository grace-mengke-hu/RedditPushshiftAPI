It's been one month. Nobody knew I smoked. Nobody knows I quit.

I smoked from the ages of 17-24. I quit and I got a lot of encouragement and support. I started smoking again when I was 27. Nobody knew about this because I smoked lightly, at home, and never after I showered to go out. I'm 30 now.

I quit one month ago and I have nobody to celebrate with. I'm about to buy myself a present with the money saved.

I'm posting here because I just want to tell someone. This has been hard and I want it to last forever. I don't ever want to smoke again. But I like it. It's not the addiction or the psychological habit. I just enjoy the act of lighting a cigarette and smoking it.

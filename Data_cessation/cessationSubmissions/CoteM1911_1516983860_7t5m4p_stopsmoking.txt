First time sick since smoking...

So the last time I was sick was almost 6 months ago when I quit smoking. I'm now having my first cold without smoking. My chest feels like it's filled with cement, body aches, sneezes the whole nine. 
...This is the best sick I've ever had lmao. With the way my chest feels now I can't IMAGINE smoking on top of it. I already feel like I'm starting to get on the upswing of this after a day and a half, versus when I was smoking it was a full blown week of sickness torture. 
Although I feel like shit, it's a pretty cool feeling to just feel SICK. And not have the withdrawal and suck down a cig while my lungs already feel like bricks. Ugh, good fucking riddance. 

I hope ya'll  make it to your first cold smoke free. It's kinda cool!

Relapsed tonight.

I was two months in but I was surrounded by friends who smoke cigarettes and we were all drinking and I succumbed. I feel pretty bad. My lungs hurt honestly. I remembered why I hate smoking in the first place. I’m trying to show myself some kindness that healing isn’t always linear and hiccups happen. I’m just going to get back on the horse again. I really really hate smoking.

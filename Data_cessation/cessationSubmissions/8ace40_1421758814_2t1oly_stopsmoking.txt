Just 3 days. Wish me luck!

Hi people, my name is Frank. I found this sub like a month ago, and 3 days ago I decided to finally make the big step. Been a smoker for about 10 years (I'm 24,) smoking between 10 and 20 cigarettes per day. I just cut it off, no treatments, no patches. It's actually the third time I "quit" smoking, the other two I lasted about 8 months. I read Alen Carr's book and it helped me a lot, but I realize that the decision is within one, and if one doesn't *really* want to quit, there's no treatment that works.  
I really hope this time I will *actually* quit smoking. Maybe with your support I will (my mom quitting about 3 months ago helps too.) I just don't wanna feel like shit anymore. I don't want to die from cancer, I want to be healthy.

Thank you.

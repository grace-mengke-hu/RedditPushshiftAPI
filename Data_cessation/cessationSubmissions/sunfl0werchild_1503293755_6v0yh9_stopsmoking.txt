3 weeks in...

School starts this week on Tuesday. First time at a University and not community college. Nervous about how first day jitters are gonna go with no smoking and first week with receiving all of syllabi. I get nervous every single semester regardless of where I am, but I've always had "my little buddy" to help me cope. Just had to put that out there. I know it will be okay in the end. The initial thought just popped into my head though.

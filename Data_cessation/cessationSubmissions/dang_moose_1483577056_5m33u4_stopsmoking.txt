24 hours and I caved

I went 24 hours without a smoke. The hardest moments were in the car, after lunch and after dinner. I smoke usually 4 cigarettes a day and I finally caved tonight after dinner.I felt terrible and I put it out about half way through. I am so disappointed but tomorrow is a new day. I just joined this sub and you guys are amazing.

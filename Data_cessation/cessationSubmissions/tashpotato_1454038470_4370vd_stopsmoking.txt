Second time quitting, last time was 6 years so hopefully I can do it properly this time

I have smoked since I was 16, I did quit for 6 years when I became a smoking cessation officer as I didn't wanna be a hypocrite.  
I moved to Australia nearly 3 years ago and started smoking again - Today, I randomly decided it was time again.  

I am doing what I know is best for me and worked last time, cold turkey. No patches/gum/inhalators.  

Wish me luck!!

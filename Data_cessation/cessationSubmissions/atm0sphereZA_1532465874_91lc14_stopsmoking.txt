I stopped for 3 years

I feel ashamed after 3 years I started smoking again when a relative visited me. I have vowed my current box of ciggs is my last box and I could really use the support. It's been 3 weeks of smoking. I did 2 days in those 3 weeks of no smoking so I know I can do it. Wish me luck.

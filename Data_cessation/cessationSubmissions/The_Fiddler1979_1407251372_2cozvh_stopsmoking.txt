Full rotation around the sun...

Hi team,

I was a smoker for 20 years. Worked up to a pack a day.

I've finally got to the point I can let go of the moniker "ex-smoker" and let myself continue to live as a "non-smoker"

People constantly ask "do you feel any better", well, truth be told, I can only remember how I felt a few days ago, and I'm sure that was better than 12 months ago, but it's difficult to compare.

My method was Champix (Aus - I believe it's Chantix in US?) I had nightmares and tension headaches, I did smoking with Cahmpix for 2 weeks, and 2 weeks not, then gave the Champix away and went on willpower (See point 2 below)

Can I just say, if you're worried about nightmares and stress headaches etc, well, I'm pretty sure any lung cancer sufferer would tell you to harden the fuck up.

For a bit of perspective, I paid CASH for a trip around Europe (15 countries in 31 days) with the money I saved from not smoking for 8 months.

I don't have much else to say, except the following two points:

1: The first two weeks are the hardest (Specifically day 4 for me)

2: **The cravings only last for 5 minutes.** Occupy yourself for 5 minutes, you won't hate yourself for not having a ciggie.

3: Set yourself smaller goals: Don't smoke for 3 months, 6 months, 12 months. Hitting a full year has resonated with me for a long time and been my major goal. Yours may be different, but it gives you something to challenge yourself with.

Apart from that, I'm out of here. For my mental state, I am officially declaring myself a non-smoker, and as such will be removing myself from anything that connects me to being a "non-smoker".

I wish you all luck, and most of all, strength of character.

Much love and thanks for all the fish.

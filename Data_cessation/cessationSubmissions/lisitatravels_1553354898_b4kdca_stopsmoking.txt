New here...

I am a member of r/stopdrinking and the support of the community has helped me reach 114 days of no drinking, so here I am with you good people of the internet and r/stopsmoking. 

I've had 3 sinus infections in 4 months, and have cut down, but have not fully stopped. I purchased nicotine lozenges today and I have 'The Easy Way to Stop Smoking' by Allen Carr. I'll peruse the site for advice. Thanks for being in this sub. &lt;3

I quote years ago but started up again

i quit smoking years ago but started smoking 8 cigarettes a week. I buy a pack of american spirits or two a week and take 3 or four out and give the rest to a homeless person or throw them away. I hate myself for smoking at all. It makes me sick. i can't stop. I know it is purely physiological at this point.

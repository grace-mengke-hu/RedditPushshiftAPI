Parents have been smoking for about 45 years. They’ve got two grandkids (newborn and 2 year old) how do I convince them to commit to quoting?

Any suggestions tips or comments welcome. They’ve both been smoking since they were around 17. I was hopeful that the grandkids would make them see that it was time to quit. That they could take back a few years or more of their lives to spend with them. I’ve done google searches and searched on here. Haven’t found that much. Google Only brings ads for nicotine gum and the like. I want real advice from people that have been smoking for this amount of time. They’re both retired I’d say smoke probably a pack a day between the two of them... I should ad. My mom has cut down quite a bit but my dad has not. He’s a drinker and an occasional pot smoker as well. I tell him to just smoke that stuff not cigarettes but it doesn’t work. Again any advise, tips, suggestions on which gums or whatever have actually worked for people are welcome.

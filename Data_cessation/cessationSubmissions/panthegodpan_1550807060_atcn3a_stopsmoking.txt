nicotine lozenges are effective for me, at least for short term. So far, better than gum or vaping. Triggers will fuck you though.

Ya'll know about triggers? It took only a few days and i was down to one lozenge, 4 mg per day. AND spitting that shit out halfway. Conventional, typical family drama had its way with me and i needed liquor and those nasty nicotine shotgun shells. 

it's pretty hard to resist if there are smokes left over the next day. that's an old school thing, but i do as i have done: smoke em all. but then at the slightest provocation (dropped my pencil, FUCK FUCK), or before, if you can anticipate it, pop that baby,  

AND DO NOT SUCK ON IT LIKE CANDY. 

i was so sick the first couple of times, and worried i should have gone with the lower dosage. no no no.

sublingual. put it under the tongue and try to forget it. you won't, but you won't feel compelled to smoke. unless your favorite family person shows up. ever taken LSD? I digress. talk to your doctor about how this could affect your lifestyle.

just premeditate avoiding the triggers and keep the nicotine shots handy. that is some oblivious, unsympathatic shit to say, and i apologize. maybe tomorrow i'll spare you a square, or a lozenge. 

side note: FUCK THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY

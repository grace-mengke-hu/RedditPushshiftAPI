Stopped smoking but need some advice!

Long story short I'm 32 had smoked for 17 years pretty much straight. I've quit before, the longest was about a year. 
I've had different struggles each time but find my struggle this time to be the hardest yet. 
I'm realizing now for 17 years my main way of de-stressing has been to have a cigarette and that's always been effective enough for me.  I work for a family business so things can get pretty stressful. 
I feel now that I have little to no tools to release my stress and was hoping that maybe some of you who have stopped smoking and have stayed that way might have some wonderful internet guru advise for me!
I realize that cigarettes create a stressful situation and to relieve it one has to have a cigarette so in perspective I'm less stressed than before but even being a month in I'm having a lot of difficulty not going back to it. 
Thanks in advance!

Stressed and emotional - 3 weeks

I was a week into quitting when a good friend died by suicide. 

I smoked at the hospital while he was in a coma and then stopped again. I smoked at his funeral and then stopped the next day.

Adding to this is that I'm very busy with both work and school. I can barely concentrate and I'm probably pretty unpleasant to be around. Obviously there's more to my problems than just stopping smoking, but I feel like I could really use the crutch. Should I hold off quitting until my life calms down? Get an e-cig maybe?

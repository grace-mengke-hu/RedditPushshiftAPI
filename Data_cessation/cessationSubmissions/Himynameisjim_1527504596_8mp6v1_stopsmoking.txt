Just had my final cigarette

So after smoking 15 a day for 7 years I’ve just had my final cigarette. Tried quitting multiple times only to fall at the first hurdle. But enough is enough. Im sick of having a persistent cough and coughing up phlegm in the morning. I’ve read the easy way and am now going to enjoy my first day of being a non smoker. Thank you to this sub for all of its success stories to give me the courage to finally quit.

Relapsed but learned something

This is my second time seriously quitting. I’ve read some of Allen Carr’s book which really did help to put things in perspective for me. I had been smoke free for about 12 days and was doing really well. Reminding myself that it isn’t ME who wants a cigarette, it’s my nicotine addiction, and that I don’t want to be addicted to nicotine anymore, helps a lot.   

Last night, my boyfriend who inspired me to quit broke up with me. I have wanted to quit for a while and he had quit himself. His support gave me the push i needed. So when he broke up with me I had this strange feeling. I wasn’t necessarily even craving nicotine. I just... wanted to feel better, i wanted to spite him because he isn’t around to tell me he’s proud, i don’t know. So I smoked. 

But guess what? I didnt feel better. I didnt even feel like “ah I missed you” when I inhaled. Literally nothing was different except now I had that shit taste in my mouth again, that I was happy to be rid of.  I feel guilty that I smoked, I feel hopeful that it was my last time. Ive reset my app. I know I can do this. My favorite line from Allen Carr’s book is:  

“Smoking doesn’t fill the void, it creates it. “

Hey guys,new here

So I'm young(no ages given) but I've been smoking for 4 years now and its driven friends away from me, but also its brought me closer to others, during my second year of smoking Igot into smoking weed, alot, (about 2g a day) for about a year and a half, and I've just about managed to kick that habit. But at the beginning of this year I managed to quit smoking for 3months, I started again due to personal reasons and now I can't seem to stop.
I just want to see what helped you guys kick your habit and what made you stop smoking, I really don't want to carry on but it feels as if, if I don't have a cigarette in my hand for a period of time then I'm missing part of myself, please help, thanks in advance

I fucked up

I had gone over 4 months, closer to five. A couple of weekends ago I got into a bad fight with the husband, left for an entire day, ending up smoking a cigarette with a friend. It was harsh, it made me dizzy, and it didn't even give me that release I was hoping for. 

So why do I still want one so bad now that I have a conflict with a customer at work? I know it won't help. 

I've allowed myself to think it's ok "every once in awhile". Before long that will turn into regular habit just like it was. I know better. But I can't get it out of my head. I'm not motivated enough anymore. I'm starting to convince myself that maybe I can "on special occasions." I know that's a lie. Help convince me that's a lie.

I bought a vaporizer. I am a failure. A failly fail failure fail. :( extremely disappointed in myself.

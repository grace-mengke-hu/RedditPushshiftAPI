Checking in with a big number two. I mean, a red number two. Wait....what?

Haha, just kidding. I'm stoked to see it's already been two weeks. I kept telling myself I needed to check in after a week and I thought that was today! 

Well, after my latest relapse, things are a lot easier. I keep remembering when I quit last year and it was so hard. I'm not saying there are not days that are very hard. If anyone has *any* tips on how to control cravings around smoker friends/coworkers, they would be much appreciated.

But at least I know I can do it, since I've done it before. At two weeks last year I felt like maybe smoking was all I was going to think about. I'm not white-knuckling it this time. My knuckles are not completely relaxed, but they're not jumping out of my skin anymore. So I'm glad for that. Not looking forward to the next craving, but definitely happy for what I have learned from last time.

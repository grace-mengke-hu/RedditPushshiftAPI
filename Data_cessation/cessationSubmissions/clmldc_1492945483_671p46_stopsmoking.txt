Symptoms of going cold turkey?

Hi /r/stopsmoking! 


My mum decided to go cold turkey 3 days ago, and now she's got a high fever, along with severe chills and sore throat. For context, she has been a fairly long term smoker (around 30 years). I'm going to take her to the doctors tomorrow first thing, but I'm wondering if I need to take her to an emergency ward at a hospital right now. I totally understand no one is really qualified to give medical advice online, but I would just like to know if her symptoms are typical of going cold turkey.

Has anyone here experienced the like? Is this a normal symptom of going cold turkey, or do I need to be really worried its something serious?

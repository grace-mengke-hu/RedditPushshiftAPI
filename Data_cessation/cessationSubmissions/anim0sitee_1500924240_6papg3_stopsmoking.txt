Tomorrow is the day.

This is day 3 of only 5-7 cigarettes, from roughly 2 packs. Have smoked for 12 years. Quitting will be my 30th birthday present to myself in August. Today I feel like absolute crap. No energy, no motivation, no drive to do anything. And I'm not even to the 0 cigarette days. Luckily my husband is joining me. If I feel this bad now, I can't imagine how I'm going to feel for the next 3. I told my husband that this is something I absolutely only want to do ONCE. And in all honesty I feel like it will be easier after today. I have the added bonus of being a stay at home mom that does not drive so once this pack is out, I'm pretty much out and stuck. I will happily accept all good vibes and motivation and reassurance that it is not going to suck forever.

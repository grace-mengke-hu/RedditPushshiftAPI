365!

It wasn't easy the first few months but now it hardly crosses my mind that I used to smoke. One year ago today, I listened to the audio book of Allen Carr's, The Easy Way straight through and quit that day. I was skeptical about the book going into it but what he said about how addiction was less convenient than going through the process of quitting, made a lot of sense to me. So I quit, cold turkey and I would say it was pretty easy altogether.

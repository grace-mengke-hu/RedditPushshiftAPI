is normal to slip and smoke only on day 4?

and I smoked all I wanted, but back 0, day 2 and in a couple of hours will start day 3 that last week was a horrible day. Have my patches,  nasal spray, my husband working from home tomorrow and still motivated.  Is normal to slip that early? what is going to happen in 2 week? anybody that is wearing patches feel that they fall after a few hours, sport or shower?

I want a cig but I don't want to kill me I love me - Thought experiment

**Me:** Are you feeling down and happy causing agitation
Me: Yes
**Me:** Do you want a cig
Me: Yes
**Me:** Then have one
Me: Wait, who are you? Should I trust you?
**Me:** I'm you. You can trust yourself, can't you?
**Me:** I don't really care I'm the one that doesn't want a cig. But I'm trying to convince you to smoke one. Don't you get it?
Me: Did we just swap places? You can't use two sides for yourself to get me to smoke..
**Me:** Smoke the cigarette forget who we are
Me: You're evil to us and stupid!
Me: I know that's why we're smart if **we** don't smoke tho
Me: See now I have all the power.
**Me:** .. You know how to do it as well..

It has been decided that I won't start smoking again..

Smoking for 4+ years and need tips to stop smoking while drinking.

Hi so I have been smoking for 4 years now and i decided to stop while I could and I figured it would be easier than stopping at a later date but I find it really hard to stop the craving while i'm drinking so I was wondering if any of you guys have some tips to help?

Tomorrow begins a new journey...

Been thinking a lot lately about quitting. I am not the best at motivating myself and I am surrounded by smokers friends and family, but I've finally decided to actually take control over my life. Cigarettes have only dug a hole in my wallet and health, and for what? I've "only" been a smoker for 4 years so I am hoping I haven't done too much damage to myself, but I know stopping will make me feel so much better heath wise and physically. Cigarettes have not brought anything of value in my life. I am writing this post to only to really share a little piece of my life and coming journey! Time to be on the good team for once! Team no smoke!!!

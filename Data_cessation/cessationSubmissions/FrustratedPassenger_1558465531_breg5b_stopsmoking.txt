8 hours so far

I made it 8 hours. A couple of minutes ago I almost! almost! almost! ran out and bought a pack of cigarettes. BUUUUT I didn't. I've gotten nothing done at work today. It's a bad time to get lazy at work but I'll figure it out later. 

The next hurdle is driving home. I don't smoke in my car (or my house, for that matter) but I pull over in a parking lot and smoke one. I pulled over 5 times yesterday on the way home. It's stupid and ridiculous. 

I just noticed I'm capitalizing again.

8 hours, 4 minutes and 42 seconds. 6 cigarettes not smoked, saving $3.87. Life saved: 30 minutes.

I want to quit smoking. Need help.

I was smoking 8-10 cigratte per day for past 7-8 years. I have stopped, first time in my life, i have. Now for 1 week not a single puff. But i am experiencing coughs, a lot, it's painful to the point i am not able to do anything anymore. But i wanna quit. And that's where i need your help.

What can i expect going forward? Is there anything i can do to make it less painful. Thanks in advance. 

Edit: Thanks for the support and help. It means a lot as i am doing this alone, haven't mentioned to a single person outside of reddit. Don't want to let anyone make light of this thing. 

Also great to hear some of the stories of recovery. You guys are awesome. Keep it up. 

Few things i have tried that seemed to be helping,
- Green tea with honey
- Lots of water (as many of you suggested)
- Maintaining a strong diet, no skipping.
- Just calling someone randomly or starting some conversation with whoever nearby whenever the urge is getting too strong.

I will be quitting soon.

In my previous attempts at quitting the one thing that caused my relapse was the habit of it. When I wasn't smoking there was the constant feeling of something missing, like I forgot an important appointment or something similar. What I need to finally kick this habit for good is a habit that isn't detrimental to my health to replace it. On that note the reason for this post is to ask for suggestions so that when I smoke my last I will have an arsenal of things to fill that time.

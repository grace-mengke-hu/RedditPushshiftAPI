Beginning day 3 of being smoke-free!

It's 10:30am and the beginning of day 3 for me! I've been smoking since my early teens and am now in my mid twenties... and this is the farthest/longest I've made it yet. This time though, I have zero doubt I can do this.

It's not going to be easy but in the name of a happier and healthier tomorrow, it will be worth it.

If anyone was wondering... I'm not using any replacement therapy of any sort, just going off of willpower. So far, so good. I think it helps that I'm on vacation right now (and because of this I don't have my usual routines and 'I need a smoke' triggers) 

Best of luck to everyone on their journey to a smoke free life.

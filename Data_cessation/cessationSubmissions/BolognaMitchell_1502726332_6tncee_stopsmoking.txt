Talked myself out of a relapse last night

I'm just over a month into this quit. Since the first week ended, I've had a pretty easy time avoiding smoking, and I have had a lot of days already where I don't even think about smoking at all.

But last night I was at work late, trying to finish a project before Monday morning, and I was tired, and I was cranky that I was working and not at home, and for some reason I was trying to convince myself that I could just go buy a pack and chain smoke while I was working and then throw the pack away before i went to sleep. This wasn't one of those 5-minute cravings that goes away, I literally had about a 2-hour mental conversation with myself before I finally decided it wasn't worth it.

I was successful this time, but it was kind of scary because I know there was a pretty good chance it could have went the other way. I'm kind of worried that this will happen again in a few weeks and I won't be so lucky.

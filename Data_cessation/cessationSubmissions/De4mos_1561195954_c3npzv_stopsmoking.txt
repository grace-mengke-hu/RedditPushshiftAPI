I want to quit smoking in 2 weeks.

I'm 18 years old. Smoking since 15. I always said that I can quit whenever I want but now I realise what nicotine did to my body and brain. I have some important exams on 1st, 3rd and 4th of July. I don't want to quit smoking until then because I'm afraid I'll think only about having a cigarette. 

So... I realised that I want to do many things with my life and not just die at age of 50 from a lung cancer. Smoking is expensive and not healthy. After these exams I want to go out and meet new people, get my driver's licence and many many other things. 

What advices can you give me in order to just stop smoking. No more 'one last cigar', Iqos or vaping. Quit everything that involves nicotine. How y'all over one year managed to do it?

Stopped 2 days ago but I feel like it will last

So i stopped smoking just two days ago, but this is the first time I'm really trying. Before, I just didn't have the drive to quit. Two days ago I woke up after a night of heavy drinking to find out I smoked a whole pack in one evening again and I just decided not to buy another one. I hope I can keep it up when drunk or at parties, because I believe those are the most compromising situations. Has anyone who quit had the same feeling? Just one day you don't feel like it and quit?

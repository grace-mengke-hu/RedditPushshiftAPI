Decided as I was going to bed last night I wanted badly to be done smoking. Started on hookah when I was 14 and have been smoking tobacco products for the last seven years. Today is day one. Any pro tips that will make my first few days easier?

Decided as I was going to bed last night I wanted badly to be done smoking. Started on hookah when I was 14 and have been smoking tobacco products for the last seven years. Today is day one. Figured this would be a great support group for me!! Browsing through the top all time posts and I see a lot of warnings and sad stories of cancer and disease. Was looking more for some little ideas to make my cessation easier. Any pro tips that will make my first few days easier?

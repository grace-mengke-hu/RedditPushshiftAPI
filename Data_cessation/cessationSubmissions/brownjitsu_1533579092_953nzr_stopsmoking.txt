Almost a year smoke-free. Some observations I have found!

I was a half pack smoker a day and last year was diagnosed with general anxiety disorder. I went on some medicine for the gad and champix for the smoking. Here’s a couple things I’ve noticed since being smoke free:

1) I still fight the addiction every day,  it it a lot easier now. I will occasionally fell a twinge of guilt even seeing someone with a pack of smokes on tv

2) I tried replacing my negative addiction (smoking) into a positive addiction (exercise). I commute to work on my bike every day (30 km round trip) and run two or three times a week (5 km per run). These are distances healthy people should be able to do no problem. I almost cried the first time I ran 5km. It’s something I never thought i could do being a smoker.

3) my work life is so much better. I got two promotions and an office at the firm I work at in this last year. 

4) my family life is 1000x better. I don’t feel guilty around my mom or my girlfriend. I’m generally a lot happier. 

My life has gotten so much better after I quit smoking and tackled my anxiety disorder. Everyone’s journey is different. But the first step is to admit you have an addiction and know that you want a better life for yourself.

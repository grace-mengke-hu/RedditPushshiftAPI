Help needed: loss cognitive performance

I smoked for 30 years a pack per day, and I stopped in September. Since then I experienced the expected side effects of nicotine withdrawal (the craving, irritability, you name it). I believe I can deal with that, but what worries me is a tremendous decrease of cognitive performance, that doesnâ€™t appear to go away. I have difficulty concentrating, i am unable to stay focused, i forget things, i am tired and sleepy... my productivity is pathetic (i am a computer science researcher, i need my brain), and to be entirely honest, this is really scary.

Do you know any supplement, drug, whatever that may help me recover my cognitive performance? Did any of you had the same type of side effect? Did you recover? How long did it take?

Whooooaaaa!!Holy mother of cravings!

Holy shit, this is rather strange and caught me off-guard. I am having crazy cravings this morning. They are quite strong too, to the point where I was thinking smoking one would be great right now, go back to my old routine....I know I don't want to do it, but damn...I could taste the cigarette, I could feel the old routine, standing in a garage, drinking my redbull and smoking one.  But now, as I type all that, I think how far I have come and how fucking stupid it would be. How horrible I would feel, tried again, not motivated, spending money on those things. I would be back to square one. I would lose all respect that I gained from everyone. 

It must be one of those days. I didn't expect these cravings to come at me like that. 

WTF? I gotta snap out of this shit! Time to get moving this fine saturday morning and do some home improvement things! 

Make it a good day today you sexy non smokers! 

In closing, I would like to give a shutout to my New Year quitters. 3 more days until two full months! Get sum!

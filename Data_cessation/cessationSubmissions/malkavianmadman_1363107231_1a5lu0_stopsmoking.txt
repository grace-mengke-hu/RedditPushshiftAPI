How do you deal with stress?

Hi everyone, I have recently decided to try (yet again) to quit smoking. I am on my last pack (hopefully ever). Now over the last 4 years I have tried to quit 4 times. Each time I have had success from Feb to August.

The main issue seems to be that I started smoking as a teenager at about 15 (I am now 28) and it has always been my go to for stress management. So inveriably something super stressful happens and I fall off the wagon hard.

So what do you do to deal with stress when you quit because frankly I need some tips?

Thanks in advance

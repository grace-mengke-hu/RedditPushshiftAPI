Two weeks in and it feels harder instead of easier.

So my first week went pretty good, I feel like the momentum of my quit helped me power through any cravings. Now I am into my third week and I keep thinking "Do I have to do this forever?", starting to think "Maybe after a few months I can just be a social smoker"

I know where all of this goes, but do you all have any tips for me in this phase?

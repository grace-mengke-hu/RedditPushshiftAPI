Need some advice from recovering smokers...

Ok, so I quit smoking about 4 months ago. It's been manageable for me. However, since the weather has been getting colder, I've been having a lot of cravings.
It's almost like I feel like I can't enjoy the autumn as much as I would than if I was smoking. I used to love being outside smoking at night in October. I used to love doing it on summer nights too, but for some reason the autumn is having more of an affect on me. I was very close to picking up a pack earlier. Honestly, if cugarettes weren't as expensive as they are by me ($11.50/pack), I probably would have got a pack. 
I guess the important thing is that I didn't fall victim to the itch. Just wondering if other people have had this seasonal craving type thing.

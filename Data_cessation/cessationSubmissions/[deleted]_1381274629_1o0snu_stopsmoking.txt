Today marks the first time I've made it to two months without a smoke in 20 years.

That feels really good. I was under 13 when I started so I never thought I'd be rid of it but it looks like it's working this time. Used patches for 3 weeks then cold turkey. I get a little irritable every once and a while and have to be careful around snack foods (munchies) but overall I feel really good about it. I kept my smoking a secret for the most part for the past seven years so I really don't have anybody to tell so I thought I'd post it here. Thanks for reading.

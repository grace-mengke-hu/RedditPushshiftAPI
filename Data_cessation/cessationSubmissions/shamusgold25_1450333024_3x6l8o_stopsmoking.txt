looking for some advice at this point

First off I would like to say I'm new to this sub. It has been 8 days now that I haven't smoked. I've been good up until Sunday, and now I'm easily agitated which causes me to want to smoke even more. What's making this a lot harder for me is that I live with my parents still. Both my parents have been smoking for years, and they smoke in the house. Have any of you been in a situation like this?

Day 8 in the morning

This still feels great. I want to encourage everybody that just started becoming a non smoker, like i did 8 days ago.

in the end it is not as hard as you might think. just dont light one.

i keep telling myself, that if i wont stop, it will kill me. 

after 8 days i feel much better already.

i wanted to share this! i hope everybody enjoys it as much as i do.

all the best, and thanks for sharing your experineces, thoughts, answers, encouragement, ideas and success stories. it really helps a lot to scroll and read them.

Feeling it today.

I'm stressed. My quitting time around has been the smoothest it's ever been. Things are looking up! 

Today I go in to get my brakes changed and it's a lot more expensive than I thought it would be. Fuck. 

My credit card bill is getting pretty high, and I need to save up for a rent deposit to move to a new place in a month or so. I'm broke. 

I'm sitting here at Budget Brakes and for the first time in a while I almost walked out, bought a pack and lit up. 

Alas, I won't. Just gonna sit here and chew on my last soggy toothpick while my phone slowly drains it's battery. 

I may be a downer, but at least I'm not a downer that smells like a cigarette. 

Thanks for listening.

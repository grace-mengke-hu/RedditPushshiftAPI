2 months, 11 days, and 6 hours and it's feeling like days 3-7!

As stated in the title, it's been over 2 months since I became smoke free. There have been ups and downs, but on the whole I felt good about my decision and knew that this was better for my health, relationships, and overall life.

However, the last 7 days have been hell. It feels like I've jumped back to days 3-7 in the quitting process. I am constantly fighting with my addiction. Every couple of hours I'm having the pushy voice scream: "remember how nice a cigarette was with activity 'X'? Let's smoke again!" 

I'm looking for tips and advice to get through this because I'm starting to get worn down and am fearful that if this doesn't pass, that I may relapse. Even if any of you have a similar experience so that I know I'm not alone.

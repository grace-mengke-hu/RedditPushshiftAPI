Looking to vent and maybe get some support.

Hello everyone,

Forgive me, this is going to be a long rambling vent, I just need to get it out.

So I've been smoking for 5 years, a pack a day for the last two. I hate it, I HATE IT. But those chemical addictions, you know?

So yesterday, I was determined to quit. I had a few days off work to get over the worst of the bitchyness that nicotine withdrawal brings, I also hate the brain fog that comes with it, and wanted to avoid responsiblities for as much as possible when I was dealing with it.

4 hours. I went 4 hours without a cigarette, and my goddamn roommate asked to bum a smoke.
He knew I was quitting, he knew I would be fucking pissed if he asked again, and worst of all, he knew that if he'd ask I would crumble and buy a pack so he could get his fix. He's been smoking about two a day for the best part of a year now, bumming off me and the other roommate.

He's also my landlord, so I've informed him that next time he asks to bum one I'll be docking his rent money next month. Its just totally unacceptable to deliberately sabotage me so HE can get ONE FUCKING SMOKE.

This isn't the first time this has happened. And I don't suppose it'll be the last. Hopefully the idea of getting $100 less money from me each time he asks will stop him, but... Well... I have my doubts.

I can't afford rent and food for me and my dog AND cigarettes, I'm sick of leaching off my poor parents (as I've been doing for just about all my life) I'm sick of smelling like smoke all the fucking time, I'm sick of this fucking smokers cough, I'm sick of this fucking LIFE. 

I HATE that I'm not strong enough to fight the cravings, I hate that I have people in my life who are deliberately sabotaging me, and I hate that I currently have a cigarette in my hand.

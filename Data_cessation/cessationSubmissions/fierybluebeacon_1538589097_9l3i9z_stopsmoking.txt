Could use some support in staying quit after a difficult time

So a couple of weeks back a friend of mine passed away, and I had a few cigarettes after 4 months without one, just to help me get through that weekend. I also had a couple the following week as my bad nicotine brain now thinks I've quit quitting. I'm back to thinking about smoking all day long, and it's been hard convincing myself I shouldn't just give up completely. Any advice or encouragement would be really appreciated!

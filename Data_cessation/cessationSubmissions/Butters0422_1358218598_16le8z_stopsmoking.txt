1 week down!

Haven't smoked in a week. I am so proud of my progress, but I'm on the patch so I'm not free from the Nicotine. I dont really know what to say... other than the dreams are intense but no nightmares yet. Its strange that I am getting my fix through the patch yet i still want to smoke. Addiction sucks but i hope i can make it through it.

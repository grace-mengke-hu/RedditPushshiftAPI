Tea/Coffee does help.

This is my second attemp of quitting and It was a lot easier this time.
I used smoking as break, as many of you do.
But when i quit it was a problem, i didnt know how to take a break for 10 mins.
It might be end of the day or in the office.
I just started going to tea/coffee house and drink it everytime i wanted a little break.

For me weekends were the hardest because you have nothing to do and wanna go out for a while.
Before i smoked max on weekend.Now i go to a place near my home to have some tea.

If you are thinking that it might go costly, then let me tell you one thing. I am from India and One Cig is expensive then a cup of tea.(Coffee is way expensive )
I know some will say i am substituting habbits
but here is the deal, i like some alone time of 10 min here and there to reset and tea helps

Hope you find this useful.

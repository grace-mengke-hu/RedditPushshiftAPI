What I've learned in the first couple days of quitting

So my journey started about 4 days ago and I've learned so much in this time that I'd like to share; even if it's been said before.

•exercise is amazing.  I had literally no cravings at all when I was snowboarding.  

•make a list of why you want to quit and keep it with you at all times.  When I got a craving i would take out my list and it would reassure myself why I was quitting.  I often forgot about the pros of quitting and never the cons of continuing to smoke.  Some pros I wrote down include: not freezing going out for a smoke in -20 weather, the bountiful amount of money saved, overall I'll be MUCH healthier, be able to run a distance without thinking about passing out, be more attractive around girls (smoking is not flattering no matter how much you think it is) 

•it's not as dreadful as you may think.  This will for sure vary depending on how much and how long you've smoked.  I smoked about a quarter pack a day (6-7, canadian packs) for a year and a half.  The cravings are real and suck, but they aren't significantly life ruining.  I was still able to do everything I wanted.  I wasn't bed ridden craving a cigarette, twitching at every thought for a smoke, etc...

•avoid people who you would usually smoke with for a short while.  Hopefully these people will respect the fact that you're quitting.  It's way easier to avoid these people than to avoid having a cigarette while you're around them.

•and last tip.  Just laugh.  Sometimes I just stopped what I was doing and laughed.  I laughed at how I was going to be free from the grips of cigarettes.  Laugh at how you know your life is going to be so much better without them.  Laugh at your future victory.  

Hopefully this helps some people out, good luck guys

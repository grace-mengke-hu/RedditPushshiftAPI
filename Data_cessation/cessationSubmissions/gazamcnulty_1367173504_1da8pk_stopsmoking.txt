9 months in and I'm thinking of starting smoking again. I miss it so much and so what if I die at 70 instead of 80!?

I don't even get cravings anymore I just miss the enjoyment of them. For example if I were to think about myself sitting at home for the day playing videogames, it'd be nice. But then if I imagine that same situation but with the addition of an unopened bag of tobacco next to me... that is heaven! GOD I MISS SMOKING

Starting stopping tomorrow. Any tips?

This will be the second time I successfully quit.  About 10 years ago, I genuinely quit for 6 years.  Somehow, I started again a little less than 4 years ago.  This is likely attributed to the development of a drinking problem.  I quit drinking 5 months ago and now want to quit smoking.  My wife literally tells me not to quit because she believes I'm unbearable when not smoking.  I've drifted away from my friends since I quit drinking, so not much support on that end. 

My plan is to start the day without smoking tomorrow.  I plan to pick back up my once religious exercise routine tomorrow as well (my belief is that it helped the first time) and have been reading "The Easy Way to Quit Smoking".  Plan on finishing it today.  I really do want to stop.  What's worked for you Reddit?

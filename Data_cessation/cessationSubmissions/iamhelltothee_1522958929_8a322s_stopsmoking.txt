Why did you pick up smoking in the first place?

Today I met up with an old friend from university with whom I used to go grab smoke breaks everyday. She still smokes, and was happy to know I quit. 

While we were talking about random things like we always did, we started talking about the reasons why we picked up smoking and what was the purpose of the cigarette for each of us. I have this theory that smoking is a solution to an inner problem we are not seeing, and attempting to quit without coming up with a different solution before hand is what makes it so hard sometimes to just drop it. 

So the point of this post is invite you to ask yourself why did you even start smoking? Actually question yourself, don't settle with answers like "to relax", follow those up with questions like "what do I need relaxing from?". It might get you to new places within yourself you haven't yet met.

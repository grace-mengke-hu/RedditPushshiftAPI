Struggling with mental health and smoking bong near daily. How do I play the long game when in short game weed calms me down?

My boyfriend wants to keep smoking and gets bummed at the idea of me quitting. I also still want to occassionally get high, I'm just not mentally healthy enough to indulge in the anxiety crutch of a small bowl here or there when "as needed" is a daily event. I'm concerned about long term effects and hindering other anxiety coping skills when smoking weed is effective, but maybe not ideal

I've never felt this committed.

I've tried to quit dozens of times, never making it past three days. So I'll be back here Saturday, to tell you all I'm still on track. My hope is that by promising that to you I'll have more resolve. 

I've been a lurker on this sub for at least a year. I'm ready to be active here, to help encourage everyone and to not feel so alone in this. <3

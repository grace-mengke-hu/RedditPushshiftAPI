Vaping, not smoking

So since I can't seem to cold Turkey it, I've switched to vaping and have been doing so the last month, give or take. However, I carpool with a heavy smoker (gross, but saving gas and I'm broke). The smell of her car and the environment on the way to work drives me insane, but I just stick to my vape. Yet, my fiance says I still smell of smoke, even my face area. He doesn't believe that I'm not smoking when I'm around her, which I understand but I know I'm being honest and sticking to my vape! Why in the world do i smell so bad from 2nd hand smoke?! Also how do i deal with the huge cravings being in a car with her triggers? The vape helps, but by the time I get home my head hurts.

I have a desk job and found it difficult to quit at work... until I started doing this!

I work in an office. I found it really hard to quit at first because there is so little to distract myself from cravings and I can see/smell my coworkers smoking. I tried to simply concentrate on work, but lets be real, there's no concentrating when all you can think about is "Smoke smoke smoke". 

A lot of the tips that I've heard to quit smoking was to go for a run or hit the gym.. be active! I thought it was a fantastic idea except for the fact that I can't just leave my office every 30 minutes to go for a run/hit the gym and come back all sweaty... 

**SO HERE'S MY SOLUTION!** Bring a skipping rope to work. If you get a craving, go HAM (Hard ass motha fuccckkaa) on that skipping rope for like 30 secs to 1 minute until you can't breathe. 90% of the time you won't even want to think about a cigarette let alone smoke one. So not only are you helping your cravings, you're also helping your health by doing a bit of cardio!! It's also short enough that you don't end up sweating buckets. 

**TL;DR: Bring a skipping rope to work and go HAM on it until you're out of breath. GG Craving.**  

*Ninja Edit:* ALSO DRINK LOTS OF WATER THROUGHOUT THE DAY! Especially if you're quitting coffee too... Quitting smoking causes constipation. Lots of liquids needed! Especially if you're stopping coffee that acted as a laxative for you before! :)

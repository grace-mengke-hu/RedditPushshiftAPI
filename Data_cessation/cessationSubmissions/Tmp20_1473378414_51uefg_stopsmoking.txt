Smoking and your teeth.

I wanted to write this for anyone who might be checking this sub daily for inspiration, motivation to quit. I am a 28 year male, who quit a few months ago after a decade of pack a day smoking. I'm 6'4" 200 lbs, run and work out daily and am mostly is great physical shape. About a month a go I noticed a great pain in the back of teeth, diagonally from where I used to pull the cigarette. To my great surprise both my back teeth were completely destroyed on the inside. They looked fine on the outside, but upon closer inspection the dentist came to one conclusion, the years of cigarette smoking bombarded those two teeth and completely destroyed them. I was shocked, embarrassed and angry. Needless to say right now I'm writing this with two teeth gone in my mouth and significant pain. Be smart, quit while you can, you might think that you are physically fit and can smoke but that crap sneaks up on you. It sure did on me. Sorry for the wall of text, but if you are thinking of quitting, YOU CAN DO IT. It only gets better.

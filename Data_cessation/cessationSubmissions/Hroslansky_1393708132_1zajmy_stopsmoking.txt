Made it 30 days. Now I'm back to day 1. Any help?

So I've been smoking since I was 16. I'm 19 now, and a pretty busy college student. Smoking used to be very social for me growing up, then coming to college it became a stress reliever. I'm the only one in my friend group who smokes, which was a big push to get me to quit. Through high school I smoked 3 to 4 cigarettes a day, then over the summer before college and coming to college, I got up to a half a pack a day. I cut way back after New Year's, and eventually was able to give up cigarettes altogether for 30 days.

The problem was, even after 30 days, I was still craving a cigarette. I wasn't happy with quitting. I didn't feel accomplished. There was no incentive to not smoke, other than my friends didn't want me to. I gained almost 10 pounds after quitting. I was irritated, stressed, and didn't feel any MORE healthy than I did before quitting. So today after I grabbed some lunch, I was alone and didn't have any plans. I took an idle stroll to the gas station, bought a pack, and smoked half a cigarette before throwing it out. 

What can I do to make the next 30 days easier? Less stressful? More gratifying? Am I just not "ready" to quit? That's how I felt. Like I wasn't completely in invested in quitting, so all I was doing was pushing myself to stop doing something I didn't want to stop doing.

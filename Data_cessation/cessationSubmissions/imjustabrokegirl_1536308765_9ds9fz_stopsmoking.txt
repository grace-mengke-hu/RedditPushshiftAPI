Cold Turkey

For those of you quitting 100% cold turkey, what do you do that helps the random cravings? I stopped smoking cigarettes 3 months ago and stopped vaping about 1-2 months ago but now I'm really craving a cig. I'm trying hard to fight this without using any form of nicotine so if you got any tips that can help drop them here for me please! I read something about sucking on an ice cube might help but looking for more tips ðŸ˜«

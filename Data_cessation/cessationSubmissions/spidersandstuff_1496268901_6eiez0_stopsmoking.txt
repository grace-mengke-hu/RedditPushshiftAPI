Back on the train yet again. They say, third time's a charm!

Yeah...i messed up again. The filthy, stinky, "I'll just have one, because i didn't smoke for 3 months" trap got me, and I've been smoking since November. Have been thinking about quitting for a long time (well, since i started) and the thing that got to me was the cardio exercises i did today. It left me so fucking breathless, and me being only 19 years old, left me with a great shame. Hope to make it stick this time, and **please, please, please don't fall for the "just 1 cigarette" trap.**

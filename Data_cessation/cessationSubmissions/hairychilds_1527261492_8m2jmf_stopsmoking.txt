Gallbladder removed last month, constant low blood sugar after quitting only 2 days. Vaping isn't helping.

Anyone been down this road? 

My sugar is low every time I check it, even when I feel okay. But I mostly don't feel okay. I'm sleeping a lot and can't get out of bed...even though there's a referendum in my country that I've been canvassing for for months lol. 


Medical card was cut recently and I don't have the money for a drs appointment.

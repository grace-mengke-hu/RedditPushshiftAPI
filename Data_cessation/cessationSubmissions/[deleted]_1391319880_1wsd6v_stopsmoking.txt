Day one is almost done.

Hey guys. I've been lurking here for a while now and I finally took the plunge after smoking constantly for the last 4 years. I've attempted to quit once before, cold turkey, I broke up with my then girlfriend about 8 times in one week before I started back up. I was a pack a day smoker (25 a day) and I was smoking reds (16mg). 

Over the past few weeks I cut down to greys (2mg I think) and once or twice a day I would swap a smoke for a nicotine gum. 

Today being my first day not smoking is going surprisingly well. I'm using the gum when I get cravings and I'm deep cleaning the house/washing all of my clothes to get rid of the smell of cigarettes. 

I'm really looking forward to tomorrow and not waking up with the disgusting taste of cigarettes in my mouth. Everything seems to be looking up.

Thanks for your time.

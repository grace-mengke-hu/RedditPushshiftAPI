Struggle but 1 month smoke free Now!!

I have been smoking for 18 years, and I really wanted to quit for myself one and my family.  The last 7 years I have been smoking a pack of newports a day and when I would go out drinking I would "eat" two packs of cigs in a night easy.  I used to be in pretty good shape but after my father passed 7 years ago I drank more and smoked more.  I needed to change, I was taking asthma medicine so I could smoke.  Eventually I just said screw it and haven't picked one up since.  I have been out and gotten pissy drunk and didn't smoke.  I can breathe and I don't smell like an ashtray anymore.  I have better energy and Just ran a mile straight with no breaks last week for the first time in a long time.  I was just ready to quit and wanted to share that with someone.  I am the happiest I have ever been not smoking, I always felt that cigs had a hold on me.  I don't crave or think about them at all anymore!!

I quit for 3 days but...

I just heard an amazing song...and remembered how awesome it was smoking with such good songs, so I need to try it now and see what I feel, I am sorry random strangers on reddit Stop Smoking. I will post update after I am done with this little experiment (This is my brain hamstering and finding reason for me to smoke).

Thank you! Thank you!

Can I just share a big THANK YOU to everyone who has posted their stories, experiences and advice? Thanks to you, I started smoking way less than I have for the past 10 years and planned my final quitdate: June 1st. Well..Sometimes life happens while your busy making other plans: last week I found out I'm a few weeks pregnant! It is thanks to all of YOU, I was able to quit immediately! 

No matter how hard it gets (at work, stuck in traffic, after dinner, during a movie, etc) there's no doubt in my mind I can do this. THANK YOU!!

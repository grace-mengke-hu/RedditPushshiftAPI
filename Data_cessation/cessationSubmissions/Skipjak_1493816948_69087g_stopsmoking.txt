A close call

I quit smoking again May 1st after a short relapse. Yesterday I spent the day alone at my girlfriends appartement while she was in class. I decided to be a good boyfriend and I cleaned up her place a bit, cooked dinner for her, etc.
While cleaning up, I found a pack of Marlboro Gold's (my favourite), containg one cigarette. A very cruel twist of fate.

It would have been the perfect crime. She didn't even know the cigarette was there, I had the place to myself for at least another hour. I decided that smoking it would be a very bad idea, and put the pack aside. As I continued preparing dinner, my mind kept wandering off to that cigarette. Eventually, I took it out of the pack, smelled it, put it in my mouth. I really felt like smoking it.

I knew I would be very dissapointed with myself if I smoked it, so I snapped it in half and put it in the thrash! 
Stay vigilant, people! :)

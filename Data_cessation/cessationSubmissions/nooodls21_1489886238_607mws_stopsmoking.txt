Help with second hand smoke.

So pretty much everyone in the school I'm in smokes and its gone to the point of if you don't smoke you are the weird one. I'm in a private school, I'm pointing it out because we have a little place where students (and teachers...) Can smoke there. Obviously I don't go there or anything but its just that, let's say someone finished smoking and came back to class (or more like 10 students), will any of that have any effect? This is probably a stupid question but will I still be exposed to second hand smoking if I don't in hale any smoke? I'm always in class or in places where people don't smoke but we have a pretty small school.

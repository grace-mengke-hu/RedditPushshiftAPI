Need Your Help

Hey dudes,

I've been in a bad place for a couple of months now where all I can think of is to try smoking. I've never done it, and up until something snapped in me last year, never wanted to. Now it's all I can think of and I'm always extremely tempted to just buy a pack and try it. Is it something that takes you in after a single smoke? Can you share to me your experiences with it - eg. Is this something you've gone through, etc.? I'm really trying to not succumb, but it seems like a losing battle. I'm sorry, I know it sounds odd, seeing as I've never tried it, but would like any advice/help on the situation.

Thanks, you guys.

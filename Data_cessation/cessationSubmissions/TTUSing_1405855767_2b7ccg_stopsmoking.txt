Been smoking for 14 years

So I have been smoking for 14 years. Since I was 18. I have tried many many many times to quite. My. Wife also smokes but she is not ready to try again. 

I go to bed every night wanting to quit and awake the next day and start again. 

I plan to smoke my last cig before bed tonight. Looking for words or wisdom, advice and support for when I wake up. 
I am so scared to start not smoking. The thought literally scares me to death and I don't know what to do.

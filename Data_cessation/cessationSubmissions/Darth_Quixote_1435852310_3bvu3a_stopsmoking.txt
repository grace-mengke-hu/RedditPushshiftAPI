5 days in, getting eaten away by remarks.

Decided to go from a pack-a-day to quitting cold turkey. First time I've attempted quitting, and damn it's been rough, but it's definitely getting easier now.

I trusted myself enough to hang out with friends yesterday. They're supportive enough in that they know what I'm going through is difficult, but they've never been ones to filter their comments. "I liked you better when you smoked," was one that made my progress more difficult. 

I'll chalk it up to a poorly timed joke, but it's still eating away at me. Any advice?

Almost caved

So my final exams were today, which stressed me a little more than I thought it would. In between the exams, all I could think of was walking to the gas station down the road and buying a pack.

"I'll only smoke one or two, just for today. You need it to relax."

But I never went. I knew it wouldn't be just one. It would be a pack. Then another. Besides, I didn't need it. They would have absolutely nothing for me.

Hang strong guys. The temptations are real, but don't listen to their lies.

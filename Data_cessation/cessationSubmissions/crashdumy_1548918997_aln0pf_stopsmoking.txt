How to support someone while they quit smoking pot

I’m 21 years old and I’ve been smoking since I was 12. I’ve been high every day since my 7th grade. 3 days ago I finally followed through with my plan to quit smoking pot. For the first 24 hours my parents and my girlfriend were extremely supportive and overjoyed with my decision. My parents smoke too which is a big factor in my smoking habits. They said they would quit. My girlfriend is 20 she doesn’t smoke and has been looking forward to the days when I wouldn’t be depended on pot. The last 2 days however have been different, I’ve not been able to sleep for more than a few hours and I’m very irritable and my mood swings every 10 minutes. I’m in dire need of support but it seems like my girlfriend is getting annoyed with me. My parents haven’t even slowed down their pot consumption and my girlfriend just seems like shes always mad at me. I’m looking for advice to give her on how to deal with myself. I’m looking for ‘how to support my bf while he quits smoking pot’ basically.

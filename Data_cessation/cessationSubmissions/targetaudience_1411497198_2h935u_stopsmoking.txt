Need help getting started

I've been smoking for 6+ years now. I quit over a year ago, only to start again 8 months later. I've been trying to quit ever since (my friends have a joke about me "quitting on Monday" as I always stop on a monday, then start again by Wednesday). Me smoking got my bf readdicted too. I feel awful about myself because I can't seem to stick with it. I want to quit, but something always brings me back, usually being in places I chain/social smoke.

Does anyone have any advice with sticking with quitting? I need to do this for myself before it's too late.

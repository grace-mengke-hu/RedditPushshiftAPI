Smoked my last cigarette (hopefully) at 10 am

        I said I was going to quit for New Years, but had some very stressful situations happen that kept me from it. Well, today I am sick and tried smoking a cigarette and was disgusted by it. Put the patch on about 30 minutes ago and I feel ready for this monkey to finally be off my back. Looking through some of these posts make me feel more confident that this is the right choice!

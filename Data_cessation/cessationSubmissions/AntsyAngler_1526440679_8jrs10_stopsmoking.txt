A quick qestion for seasoned quitters.

Hey serious nicotine addicts turned non-smokers, when did you stop feeling like you were super annoyed with everyone and very pissed off at fairly minor things?  I know I've been through this process before in previous quits, but I am too much in the thick of it right now to recall when irritability started to get a lot better.

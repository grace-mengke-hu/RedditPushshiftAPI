Have I done permanent damage to my lungs?

Hey, I've smoked marijuana 3 times in my life, twice this year. . .I stopped smoking and went thru a period of coughing up phlegm (brown) . . .it's been almost a month and no more coughing. Yet, I'm worried I've done permanent damage to my lungs. Both of the times I smoked it was with a pipe. I'm running now.

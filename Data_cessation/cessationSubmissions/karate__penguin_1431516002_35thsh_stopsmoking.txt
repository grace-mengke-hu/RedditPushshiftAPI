Some serious issues quitting.

Hi all,

I've tried to quit a million times and the longest I've ever made it was 70 days up until recently, when I broke down one night due to having a massive late-night craving.

I'm trying again today for the million and oneth time. I have an e-cigarette with several flavors and I plan to reduce dosage rapidly over the next few days. I have a vacation next week where e-cigarettes will be illegal and am not interested in using inhalers or switching back to actual cigarettes temporarily.

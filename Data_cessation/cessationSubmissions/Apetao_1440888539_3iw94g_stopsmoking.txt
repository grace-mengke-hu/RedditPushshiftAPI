You're not tobacco free and don't qualify for the company health insurance discount

So it's been 2 weeks. After a couple of restarts I have quit via vaping which I honestly only do after meals. I posted a while back about this when I tried to quit the first time.

Anyway - our company has this thing where you get $50 bucks off a month on your health insurance premium next year if you are tobacco free by Dec 1, 2015.

When I saw the form online today it said - by Tobacco Free you are indicating you don't smoke cigarettes, chew blah blah and DO NOT use E-Cigarettes....

So how is an e-cigarette still considered Tobacco?!

Anyway - 2 weeks is the longest I have been in 19 years - I don't even have a desire to smoke a regular cig but has anyone else seen this before?  I mean it's no big deal that I won't get the $50 off but is it safe to assume pretty much where insurance companies are involved vaping is pretty much Tobacco? Wtf.

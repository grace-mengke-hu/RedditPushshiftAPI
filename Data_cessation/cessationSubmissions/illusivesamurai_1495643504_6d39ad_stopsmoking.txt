Finally free!

Hey everyone, this is my first time posting here. It has officially been two weeks since i quit smoking, and I am feeling free as can be. Love seeing the support from everyone here. Havent had a single craving yet, and i'm hoping to keep it that way, and am looking forward to a healthy life.

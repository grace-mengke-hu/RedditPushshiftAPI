I refuse to smoke anymore!

To add further,  I am struggling myself right now as I am sitting here but I really do refuse to smoke again and it's not for your usual reasons of wanting to avoid cancer, or to just "be healthier". 

For me the great horror of smoking is the way it takes over you're Psychological Health. The way it carves out happiness and locks it behind a pay-gate of  bad circulation and suffering. I REFUSE AND SO DO YOU!

I have already began to see glimpses of what it means to be content, feel pleasure, feel joy and relaxation WITHOUT these satanic pieces of shit, and that is my light at the end of the tunnel.

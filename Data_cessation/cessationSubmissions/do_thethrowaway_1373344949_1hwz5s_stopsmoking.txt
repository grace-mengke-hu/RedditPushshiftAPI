Let's try this... AGAIN.

Ok, I know I'm not the only one here who is this kind of smoker; a bum. I never buy packs but at work, co-workers just hand them out. I hate the reason I started was to take breaks at work and, well, I smoke weed with lots of people, usually blunts. I enjoy the act of smoking. I've tried to quit, but it's so easy to get them and I drink, making me lose my inhibitions towards my crave. I also don't want to quit weed just yet, but the tobacco of blunts got to go, joints don't last long. In turn I got sick and couldn't smoke so i've been two days without a full cigarette,  (just couple puffs of my wifes after being drunk at my bands gig) so wish me luck as I try this again. I also had opportunities to bum one and didn't.  Shows me the commitment is back again. Hope this time it sticks.

TL; DR I bum cigarettes because it's so easy, making quitting hard, but I want to stop the 2 disgusting habits of bumming and smoking.

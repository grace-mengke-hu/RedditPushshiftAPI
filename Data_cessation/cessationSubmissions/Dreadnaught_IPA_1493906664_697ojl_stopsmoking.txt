Cold-turkey, day 2...

... and I'm doing alright.

Smoker for 20 years (fuck that's crazy seeing it written out like that), had my last smoke Tuesday night (today is Thursday). Last night was brutal, but I made it. I have an e-cig in my dresser drawer and I fought with myself to not touch that thing. I made it through and feel better today.

I did the math and I have been wasting about $300 a month on smokes...

A couple things I keep saying to myself to get me through:

- The only thing that is going to make me want to have another cigarette is having another cigarette. The further I get away from my last cigarette, the less I am going to want a next one.

- The pain is temporary

- The withdrawls are my body's way of cleansing itself

I need your opininon. I stopped smoking at the end of Dec 2016 but I smoked a pack 3 days ago?

I stopped smoking with Allen Car's method. What I understood the key is the realization that I do not *need* smoking. That's it. Whenever I had a craving I just thought hey I don't need that and I disn't light up. 
But a couple of days ago I got drunk and I smoked a cigarette one after the other and next day I just finished the box. 

That's it, I haven't bought any more, haven't had any cravings, that is it. 

I don't say I want to repeat what I did, and I truly regret that I was weak. 
But why is that I haven't (and won't) buy cigarettes and start smoking again?

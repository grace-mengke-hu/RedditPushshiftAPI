Quit question

I’ve been vaping (ik sounds stupid) since October so like 3-4 months and ik that probably sounds doesn’t sound long at all but I can already tell I’m kind of addicted and I want to stop. Any tips? It’s hard bc all my friends have one around me. Should I Chew gum? Idk I want to squash this before I’m addicted for my life. Other question. If I stop now and just cold turkey that bitch. Am I going to get urges years later? Thanks in advance

Speaking for myself, the cravings do go away

I quit and started back up many many times before I finally quit. One of the least motivating things for me when I quit was hearing about the cravings and how they would never go away, even after years of quitting. The cravings were so bad, it was just disheartening to me to hear that they would never go away, even after all the hard work of resisting them.

2 years ago, I found out my girlfriend was pregnant. She gave me an ultimatum, I had to quit smoking or she was going to leave me. At that point, she was already about to leave me anyway, as I was supposed to have quit but she had recently found out that I had been sneaking them here and there. I knew she meant it and I wanted to quit for my daughter anyway. That was finally what it took for me to quit for good. I'm just speaking from personal experience, but 2 years later, I can say that the cravings have gone away, I don't feel like I have to have my guard up all the time, terrified that I could slip up at any moment. I went to a casino the other night, after eating a big meal and having drinks, with friends that still smoke, in a smoke filled casino, and not once did it cross my mind to have one. I'll admit, it took about a year, maybe a even longer, before I felt comfortable, but it does get easier, even  easy (at least for me).

Making a habbit you have control over, till you quit forever.

Hi,
I once read a technique to tackle that situation when you know you have to quit but have no will power.

Unfortunately I can't find it back, so I am posting in case you know this technique or you have an opinion about it.

It is about smoking at a regular and consistent schedule until you quit cold turkey.

Smoke every two clock hours wether you feel like you want to smoke or not. Likewise you can gain some confidence and cut down to 10 cigs a day, so it is easier to go cold turkey once you smoke less and feel somewhat in charge of your habit.

If you don't feel like smoking you have to smoke anyway to detach the activity from your apetite or cravings. It is about enforcing a schedule not following your emotional needs, i mean not following your apetite.

What do you think? do you know where i can get more info?

btw I think after a week or so you should quit forever.

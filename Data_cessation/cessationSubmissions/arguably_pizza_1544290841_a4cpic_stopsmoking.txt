We made it one week!

Fiancee and I had a huge fight by day 3, as expected. She left the house to cool off, bought a pack, smoked one and threw the rest away. 

I managed to stay strong though, haven't even resorted to any nrt. The cold weather definitely helps; there's nothing appealing about freezing my fingers off trying to struggle through a smoke. I'm hoping by springtime, there won't be much temptation left. Two weeks here we come!

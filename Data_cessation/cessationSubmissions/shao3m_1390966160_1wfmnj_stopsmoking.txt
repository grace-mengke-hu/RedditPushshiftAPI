Had no desire to smoke up until now. Wanted to remember why I quit. Smoked an entire pack of cigarettes. Not resetting my badge.

It's easy for me to justify not smoking, but sometimes it's even possible for me to justify smoking. When I quit smoking, it was on the same date as alcohol, so my quitting smoking was completely overshadowed by quitting drinking. I mostly forgot about it, but also forgot about the benefits, especially health-wise.

After having almost 7 months without a drink or a puff from a cigarette, I realized that while I was certain that I was done with drinking, I wasn't sure about smoking. I decided one night to start smoking. I smoked a good 10 cigarettes. I made sure I didn't feel guilty, and just smoked. The next morning I bought a pack of cigarettes, and smoked as often as I felt like it.

It was a terrible feeling of being controlled by this substance. I'd spent $10, and this was just for one day. I felt my body struggling to accept these chemicals. My circulation wasn't very good. My heart was working over-time. My anxiety was high. I couldn't catch my breath. I went for a good walk, and smoked maybe 4-5 cigarettes, and then was done. I threw out the pack with a remaining 5 cigarettes.

I'm so happy this happened. It made me realize how important my health is, especially my heart. I'm going to make a positive effort to take better care of it. I'm going to start doing cardio. I'm going to take my omega oils. I'm going to eat healthier foods.

Never forget that your freedom from addiction is the most important thing you could hope for, as a free human being. Realize your accomplishment in quitting smoking, and take pride in it! Feel your body getting healthier every day, not only because you have stopped poisoning it, but because you are doing everything that you need to do to be healthy, and because you're willing to fight for your life.

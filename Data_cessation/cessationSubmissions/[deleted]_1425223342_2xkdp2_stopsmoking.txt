I have forgot smoking altogether.

Today I realised that even with almost all my friends and flatmates smoking, nowadays I have completely forgotten about smoking. My coffee table in the living room is usually full of rolling tobacco and packs of cigarettes but I don't even think about it. This is a good place to be and I feel it is really easy to quit smoking forever when you are this stage. So all you people in your early stages of quitting, remember that after a month or two it is going to be dead easy.

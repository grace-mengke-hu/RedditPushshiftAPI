42 days into quitting juul

Was at almost a pod a day. To be honest I’m having a hard time feeling the benefits. I’ve been way less sharp at work, my sales have fallen, and I generally just feel kinda out of it and depressed. I’ve had some issues in the past that are similar and I wonder if I just bite the bullet and start again. It wasn’t as dangerous as any hard drugs I’d used before, and it honestly felt like I was making big strides in my personal and professional life.

Was about 5 months into vaping btw. I smoked sometimes in college but it never stuck so it was never really a big deal. Hated the smell and all that but the juul made it a lot easier.

I’m not trying to put down anybody else’s journey, I’m just wondering if all this setback is worth it, especially because its actually hurting my income worse than what I’ve been saving. 

Thanks folks

I failed a little....

Today I reached my 8th day without smoking. I came home from work and found my boyfriend's cigarettes lying on the table and i couldn't resist....I smoked one...first just a few puffs then a few more and half an hour later I smoked the last part of it. I feel terrible now.... I was doing really well and now this. I didn't even really enjoy it because I felt guilty rightaway. A part of me is telling me don't feel TOO bad because I did well so far and there's a new day tomorrow...but I think I don't deserve my badge :(

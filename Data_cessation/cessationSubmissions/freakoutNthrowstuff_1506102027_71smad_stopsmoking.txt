time to reset and refocus.

It almost seemed as if the universe was going out of its way to get me to smoke again... I found several non-empty packs at home and I resisted. I went to the state fair, someone left a full pack on a bench next to me and I resisted. I found a half full pack at work, and I resisted. My dad left a pack in his camper when I went to get away for the weekend and I resisted. Then, I got drunk and bummed a smoke from a guy outside the bar. It was my choice, and my weak will. Then another, and another, and I bought a pack from the bar. I got back to full time smoking within 2 weeks. It started out only smoking while drinking... except I'd go the the bar 3-5 times per week just to smoke. 

Apparently I can't control myself while drinking, so now i've got to reign that in completely, too. I thought i'd made it far enough to not have to worry, but drunk me wasn't ready to give it up. Oh well, im on day 3 again. Stay strong everyone.

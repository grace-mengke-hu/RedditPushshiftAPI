It has been two weeks since my last cig. Can't sleep. Help.

Two weeks ago, I quit smoking cold turkey after four years of heavy use .  The first four days were miserable, but I had gone cold turkey before and knew what to expect, so I was able to prepare myself accordingly. So here I am, going strong. I have been eating well and going to the gym every day. I even treated myself to some personal training sessions! I feel confident in my ability to keep this up, and I can feel the physical benefis already, too.  
But I can't. Fucking. Sleep. Two weeks of this shit. I'm not worried about relapsing, but I am worried about the effects of lack of sleep on my new routine and on my general outlook. I am extremely irratable. Not in the bad-mood-leave-me-alone way, but in an I-will-destroy-you-and-everything-you-love way. I've tried mindfullness and meditation practices that I have learned in order to deal with anxiety. I cut back on caffeine. I take long hot baths and showers in order to relax. Nothing helps.  
It's six am right now. I have been up since four, after finally being able to fall asleep around one. This is about how it has been going. I have read about mild insomnia induced by smoking cessation, so I know I am not alone in this. I am just.....so fucking frustrated. I need sleep. I love sleep. I find myself wanting to go buy nyquil or tylenol pm or something, but I really don't feel like being dependant on a sleep aide.  
Do any of you have similar stories? Any tips? Anything will be appreciated.  
Thanks.

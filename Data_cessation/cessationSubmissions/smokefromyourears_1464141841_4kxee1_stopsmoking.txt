3 Weeks!!

I really feel good that smoking is not a part of me. It used to be lighting up the first one immediately after waking up and the last one before going to bed. On those rare occasions when I could not sleep during nights - used to fire up again!
Hopefully those days are over and my appreciation goes out to all redditors who have encouraged me to keep working at stopping to smoke, and also to all those who are attempting like me to kick the habit.
You can certainly do it if I can!!

Lapsed but heres why I need to keep going

I gave in Halloween, gave in last week, and last weekend I bought two packs this weekend during a drinking bender. So many emotions from the past month over relationships, anxiety and stress I couldn't handle anymore and caved on.

I lasted 45 without a single one and almost 2 months without lapsing.

But it's not over. Not by a long shot. 

I took risks and changes these past few month.

First, I quit smoking. My ONLY coping strategy I developed in my early 20's and I tried to throw it off. 

Second, I opened myself up to a relationship for the first time in 5 years.

Three, I started working out four days a week with intense cardio training and weight lifting. I've cut out soda and drinking less coffee some days I have no coffee! Barely eat pizza now, cut out most fried foods entirely from my diet or cut down in general.  Eating more fruit, adding more veggies to meals, ate out less and cooked more. I lost 15 lbs and went to the doctor for the first time.

Four, my friends have seen me vulnerable for the first time. And getting their support has made me more comfortable and has helped with with my social anxiety. I'm starting to be more social and even approached strangers at a bar just to talk!  I'm generally a wall flower in my group of friends and part of not smoking has helped me figure out how to come out of my comfort zone.

I may have failed with the first half but I'm not going to let that stop me. I know it may not seem like much, but to me, I have to remind myself how far I was from the person I wanted to be and how much closer I am. 

I've set the badge back to Day Zero, had my last cig this morning, going to get my Wellbutrin prescription after work and looking for therapists in my area. 

Let's start again.

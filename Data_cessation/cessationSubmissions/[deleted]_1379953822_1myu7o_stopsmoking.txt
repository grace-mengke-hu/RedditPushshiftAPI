I've become a non-smoker today; The EasyWay (Allen Carr)

I've done this before, and as the book indicates, it's "ridiculously easy!"

I failed by having just one; Then another. And so on. One days slip became two, became one week, became a month, now it has been 3 years. Oy vey!

This time, I won't "test myself" by having "just one".

If you haven't read or tried Allen Carr' "The Easy Way to Stop Smoking", I highly recommend it.

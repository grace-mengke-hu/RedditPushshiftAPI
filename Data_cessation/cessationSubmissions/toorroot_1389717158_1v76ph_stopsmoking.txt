It's been three days.

I drank to much on Saturday watching the Seahawks kick ass and smoked way to many cigarettes. Sunday I woke up not only feeling like a train hit my head but someone tore out my throat and lungs. I didn't smoke all day, then Monday evening came and I realized I hadn't smoked in almost two days.

For the first time in over 14 years of smoking I'm going to say "Fuck the Zero". I'm better than you cigarettes, I'm stronger than the addiction you've caused me to inflict on myself. I'm stronger than your Marlboro man, I will live longer than him, I will run further than him. 

I'm subbing to this community to be around others who have taken this amazing step. I know the next few months if not even the next few years will be tough, but the time has come my brethren. Oxygen will once again rule over these lungs!!!

Thanks for listening!

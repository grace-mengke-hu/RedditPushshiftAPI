300 Days! (and a little story)

Funny enough, I had a dream last night that I took a drag of a cigarette. It was like "oh shit I'm smoking! why am I doing that!?"

I just got back from a two day concert, 11 months after a similar two day concert event at the same location (different band) that was one of the main reasons I quit... 

I smoked a joint which induced some pretty serious anxiety causing my heart rate to sky rocket (but I knew who the real culprit was). Two days worth of smoking countless cigs and drinking put me in a pretty horrible state of health, in addition to over a decade a smoking prior. That moment was one of the big moments that made me feel I needed to quit. My heart just couldn't handle all the cigs. If it was the weed, I'd find out along the way of quitting cigs. I still drink, I still smoke pot and man did I have a way better time this year. I don't get the crazy anxiety, I don't feel like I'm out of breath, my heart doesn't pound relentlessly. Climbing the steep slopes of Alpine Valley was a breeze. I'm no health freak by any means and I have my vices, but quitting smoking was one of the best things I ever did. It wasn't easy, I still have cravings, but I'm so happy I dealt with the real difficult part and accomplished it. I returned to a place where I would have endless cravings to only have maybe one or two. To be in that zone where my mind would constantly remind me that I need smokes and to see my friends freaking out at the end of the night bumming off of each other because they already smoked their own 2 packs. **To be free from it all.** Now I just need to remain focused on never taking a single drag. 

Good luck to you, there is life after cigs and its just as good.

Coming clean on vaping as a post smoker

I haven't reset my ticker, because I haven't had a Cigarette in 487 Days... That I know, and it keeps me away from ever buying a pack. 

Tonight I'm beginning withdrawal from vaping. This coming after seeing my allergist this week, and him telling me that my Lung Capacity isn't where it should be. I definitely feel like I've had mucus build up in my throat and lungs and, well, thats it. 

I went a whole year nicotine free, then picked up vaping when my Wife transitioned from smoking to vaping (thank god). Kissing a smoker as a non-smoker is not great.

Anyway, just sharing. I thought I could dabble in vaping, but the cost is too high. I want to breathe, and run, and live as long as possible. Just not worth it. 

Peace.

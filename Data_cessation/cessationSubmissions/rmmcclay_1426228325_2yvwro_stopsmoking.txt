Similarity Between Craving and Tinnitus

This may seem odd, but I've noticed a similarity between my tinnitus (constant ringing in the ears) and the periodic craving to smoke.  Most of the time I don't notice my tinnitus. But then suddenly, there it is and it's impossible to turn it off, but usually my mind wanders off onto other things in a few minutes and I don't "hear" it anymore.  

This is very similar to my tobacco cravings.  The craving will come but tends to go away after a few minutes as my mind will always wander to other things. 

I keep this in mind.  It helps me.

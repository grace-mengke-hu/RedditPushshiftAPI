This will be attempt number.....20? maybe.. I lost count

I have been smoking for almost 5 years now I started when I joined the Navy and now i am at a command with such low morale that I feel its the only thing keeping me sane. I have tried multiple times before to quit, nicorette lozenges were successful a few times for about a month, my most successful was when I vaped for 6 months instead of cigarettes and eventually got to zero nicotine content. Vapes are now banned on ships and I have a year left at my current command. I have told my wife I would quit multiple times, when we move, when the baby comes, after deployment. and here i am now on deployment. My goal is to quit either before I come home in about 5 months or by the time I transfer in a year Looking for advice on if I should go the vape route again or if anyone else has any ideas, i hear chantix sometimes works but it really messes with your sleep not something I want to try with the current working atmosphere I am in.

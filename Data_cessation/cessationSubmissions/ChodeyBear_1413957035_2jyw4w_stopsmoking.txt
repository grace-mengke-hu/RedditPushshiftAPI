My chest x ray was clear, but...

My doctor has told me I have to change my diet as I've been diagnosed with IBS. (I had blood tests too which ruled out other possible causes of tummy stuff). I have to cut down alcohol, caffeine and fizzy drinks, and need to stop eating so much stuff like croissants and pot noodles and have to eat actual fresh food! Woe is me haha. 

I might try and combine these changes with when I'm coming completely off the nicotine in a month or so, as a bit of a fresh start. Or will this maybe be a bit much? 

I'm not starting straight away as I need to do a food diary.

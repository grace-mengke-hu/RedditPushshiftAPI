It's official

I had a scary dream about my heart and have stopped smoking for one day so far.  Having been down this road before,  I'm doing it with support this time.  

It's been easiest for me to fall back when my girlfriend and I get into a fight,  and I can't control how or when that happens  so I have to get ready with other techniques if that happens. 

We are flying to San Francisco in two weeks and I want two weeks of no smoking before that trip. 

So I'm stopping now  and I am not going to relapse.  I commit to the forum that.  Ugh.  That was hard to say. 

I will make it.  And I wot smoke on the trip either. 

Looking forward to staying in touch here.  

Time to strap in..

Had my last cigarette 30 minutes ago, anyone have suggestions to help?

I decided to quit smoking due to some health issues I've  been having the last few weeks. 

A few weeks ago I had an episode where I was getting ready for work, and all of a sudden my heart started to beat very fast, got rapid breathing, dizzy and felt like I was going to pass out. I went to the hospital and they did an EKG and blood work and said I was ok and it was probably anxiety or indigestion. A couple days later it happened again and I went back and the did the same, plus monitored me for a few hours and did a chest x-ray and said I was ok to go home. 

I still wasn't feeling any better a few days later so I went to a different hospital as I had chest tightness, shortness of breath and nauseous. They did an EKG, blood work, CT scan and everything was good, they took a step further and made me an appointment a few days later with an internal medicine dr at the hospital to dig deeper into these episodes. 

I met with the dr and he did a full assessment and determined I may have GERD, gave me a prescription, made me an appointment for a stress test, sent me for blood work including blood cultures and I'm waiting for an appointment with a gastrointestinal dr. 

I just finished reading Allan Carr's easy way to quit smoking and am determined to do it. Does anyone have other suggestions to help? I have an app that keeps track of how long I've quit for, health status based on how long I've quit for and how much I've saved. 

Is there an app where if I'm really craving a smoke, I can go on and chat with someone until the craving is gone, just having some support would help I think.

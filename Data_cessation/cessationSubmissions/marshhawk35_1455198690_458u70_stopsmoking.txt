Some reflections on the last 60 days

Well....I've reached 60 days. Two months. In my 14 years of smoking, I have never once reached this amount of time free of nicotine. It's getting much easier now and as I sit here on the train to work this morning, breathing free and easy, I want to share what I've learned.

* Most smoking literature says nicotine is out of your system in 3 days and you shouldn't have physical withdrawals after that. I'm not saying this is a lie, but it was not my personal experience. I was crawling out of my skin with horrible physical withdrawal issues for about 6 days. On day 7, those suddenly eased up and I was left with the psychological struggle. Now in the past when I tried quitting, I would always, ALWAYS go back to smoking on Day 4 because the physical withdrawals would still be going on despite my belief that they should have ended after 3 days. This would make me feel like there was something wrong with me, and I'd go back to smoking out of shame and hopelessness. This time I told myself to stop judging myself by other people's experiences and push through whatever challenges came that first week for as long as they lasted. I'm so glad I did that. It was instrumental. I guess what I'm saying is that every person's body is different. If you still feel physically shitty on day 4 or 5, THAT'S OKAY. Push through.

* Getting sick during this process helped me stay quit immensely. Early on, I got bronchitis which developed into pneumonia, and once that cleared up I got hit by two nasty colds in a row. When I think back on how many times I got sick with this kind of stuff over the past 14 years, I can't believe I never blamed the 10-20 cigarettes I smoked every day. It was always "just a cold going around" or "my normal winter case of bronchitis." Or in other words, it was always my addiction justifying its reason to exist. I haven't gotten sick since about 5 weeks into my quit, and I've been around a lot of people who are ill. My immune system feels stronger and although I still hack up lung crap every day, I am grateful my lungs are healing. My cardio stamina and breathing is so much better!

* Being around smokers now is hard, but not in the way you might think. Many people who are close to me, including my boyfriend, are smokers so I've been around it almost daily throughout my quit. In the first 3 weeks, this was hard. I wanted to join them. I wanted my old life back. I wanted to stop thinking about cigarettes every ten minutes of every day and just give in. I wished they would be more considerate of the fact that it was so hard for me. But I didn't give in. And at about a month, suddenly the smell of it was so incredibly vile! It makes me nauseated now. This may be due to my sense of smell and taste returning - things just smell really strong now anyways in general - but being grossed out by the odor has remained a great deterrent against starting to smoke again.

* Probably the biggest help in all of this was learning that each craving I feel now (yes, I do crave still, and sometimes they are overwhelmingly strong) signifies an old association that needs to be broken. I didn't become a pack-a-day smoker overnight, after all! Being an ex-smoker means we're learning to live our lives again...to reevaluate our routines, to deal with emotions without turning to the distraction of cigarettes, to stay strong and courageous when we feel depressed and heartbroken. Quitting smoking has taught me a lot about myself. It continues to teach me, and it has helped me take up new healthy things like running (C25K!) and eating better.

I'm sure I've said some of these things on this sub before, so sorry if this sounds like I'm repeating myself. I'm so very proud of all of you, whether you're thinking about quitting, or having a hard time today, or kicking ass at 1000's of days nicotine-free. Now go out there, grab the day by the horns, and do it smoke-free!!

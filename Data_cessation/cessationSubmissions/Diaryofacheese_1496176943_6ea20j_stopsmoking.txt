Day 7 and struggling.

I don't know if I'm going to make it through today... struggling with wanting to smoke because I'm stressed. Busy day at work, family members are being turds. I'm a Mom, and my kids and husband are the first ones to jump in and judge, give a ra-ra when I quit... and then forget after a few days, and start being assholes. I know I am supposed to say no to the questions , "Does smoking REALLY calm you down?" and "Does smoking really make you feel less angry?", but I secretly do think the answer to both of those questions is a resounding YESSSS 
   Does smoking enable me to  go hide in the yard, so nobody will find me? YES
   Does smoking help you to manage negative feelings? YES
  I've been pretty resolved until today. Maybe I'm being tested. I don't care.

Are my stopping smoking withdrawals normal?

Hi all. I smoked for around 6 months, 5-10 cigarettes a day. 10 days ago, I stopped smoking. The first 3 days were not so hard, I didn't experience many "withdrawals", I had slight cravings, maybe like 3 times a day until day 8. But, my problem is, after day 3 I started experiencing bad anxiety. The anxiety would be like a constant thing, all day. When I say anxiety, I mean just general feelings of anxiousness and restlessness. Another thing I noticed is that instead of my appetite increasing, my appetite actually went WAY down.. I'm not sure what anxiety other people experience when quitting smoking, but mine certainly doesn't seem normal. It's been a constant feeling of unease with anxious thoughts. I've been completely unable to relax and to just watch a TV show, because the anxiety is that bad.. The only time it seems to go is when I'm really distracted, like if I'm out with friends, or doing something physical. When I'm at home, trying to relax, I feel like I need to be sat with someone, because that will make my symptoms "better"

Now, my question is, is this normal? I'm on day 10 now and surely these symptoms should've improved. I'm getting really worried now thinking I may have some kind of underlying anxiety disorder. But that wouldn't make any sense to me, I've NEVER felt anxious before this, and I'm 19 years old, so surely I would've felt anxious at some point in my life before if this was not due to quitting smoking?

So to sum it up, my symptoms are: - Anxiety, - Restless, - Complete lack of appetite (have to force food down), - Feelings of neediness (like I need to be with somebody so I feel better), - Loss of pleasure in activities I did before, - Unable to simply relax.

Are these symptoms normal, or should I visit a doctor? Surely they should've alleviated by day 10. I'm just constantly worrying about them which is making the anxiety way worse :(

Going on 5 days. How to deal with nic withdrawal rage? I'm so fucking mad at everything I feel like I'm going up to lose control and break something / embarrass myself / seriously hurt someone's feelings

I'm normally one of the most laid back people I know but this shit is on another level, my legs are bruised from hitting them during a tantrum I threw in the car yesterday, a couple days ago I said something so mean to my partner he had to leave the house to cool down, just now I almost cussed out a bank teller. This is not fun at all please help

NOPE Not One Puff Ever

Who here uses nicotine gum?

Hey all.so I have tried to quit cold turkey multiple times. Like 6 or 7 serious efforts, I quit for 6 months once and then almost a year (pregnancy and after). I've read Allen carrs book and it didn't work for me. I've tried so many ways and times and have never been able to quit. I got a prescription for the gum from my doctor so I have two boxes (free yay Washington state).

I desperately want to quit but the withdrawals are unbearable for me as I have anxiety issues. I am a stay at home mom to a toddler so managing my anxiety is very important so she is well cared for. 

Have any of you had any success with NRT????

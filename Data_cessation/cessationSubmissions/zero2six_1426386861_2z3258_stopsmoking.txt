I realized the worst time to quit is after the last cigarette and the best time would be before the first of the day

I'm not sure if this has been mentioned here before, but it was a realization I had recently. I always decide to quit after the last cigarette of the day and it's easy to make that decision because I've already fulfilled that craving. The following day or two would result to buying a new pack with the mindset of, "I'll just quit after this pack".
  
If I can make that decision before wanting to buy another pack, then I think I'd have a better chance of completely quitting.

I smell good.

Like the orange I had after work, a bit of dial soap from washing my hands just before that snack, and a hint of shampoo from yesterday morning.

As a smoker I'd have taken two  showers by this point today and brushed my teeth half a dozen times just to still feel repulsive

Now I sit in the glory of my own wonderful aroma. Along with smelling good I smell well too- I just realized my garden roses have subtly different scents (five years later).

Loving the benefits today.  I hope you are too :)

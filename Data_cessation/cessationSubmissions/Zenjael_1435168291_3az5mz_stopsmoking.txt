I Quit Cigarettes Today - Need Advice

Well, I picked up the habit about 6 months ago, though I've enjoyed hookah and cigars on occasion for the last five years.

Yesterday it poured rain and I jogged to 711. Didn't get smokes for myself, but did for roommates. I went for a slurpee. But noticed half a mile into the jog I was out of breath. Unusual for me, and I realized that between that and the fact I now smoke half a pack a day, I need to break the habit.

So here I am; I practice martial arts daily, and write a lot. Does anyone have any tips that might help? 

Thank you! ^^

I gain weight since I stopped smoking :(

I donâ€™t know if both are related but itâ€™s horrible because since I stop smoking I gain like 2 or 3 kg. I didnâ€™t change my eating habits at all, Iâ€™m just not smoking anymore after I eat , ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ and i think, now my body absorbs more because I donâ€™t torture it with cigarettes anymore after I feed it. correct me if Iâ€™m wrong! This is a bit discouraging :( just a bit

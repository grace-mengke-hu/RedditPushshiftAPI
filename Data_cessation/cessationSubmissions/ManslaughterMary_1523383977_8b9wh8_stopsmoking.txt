Had a cigarette yesterday, but don't want one today. ACHIEVEMENT UNLOCKED?!

Im not sure when I quit smoking. I was trying to quit for about two years, and just struggled over and over. I think about a year ago, I finally actually quit. Don't get me wrong, I think I had a hit of a friend's cigarette maybe once or twice in there, but the cravings are gone. I don't think about smoking anymore in my usual day to day life. I genuinely feel free from wanting to smoke. I can pay for gas inside a station and not think about buying a pack.

I was at my friend's house unloading a bunch of emotional baggage to her, when she told me she was going outside. Like always, she offers me a cigarette, but instead of saying "not this time, thanks" (I struggled with the idea of never smoking again for a long time. I told people not this time a lot because I didn't want to be the person who quit, started again, quit, started again, etc. Jokes on me, I totally was.) I said yes. It surprised me.

She gave me one, and it didn't even taste that great. I kinda felt gross afterward. It wasn't rewarding.  Afterward, I felt kinda bad. I know I can't have just one. I played this game before, the just one game, and I just end up buying a pack. I low key braced myself for a small relapse.

But then I didn't. I bought gas, but don't buy a pack. I honestly don't want one right now. 

I don't mean this post to be some sort of encouragement to just have one. Don't smoke, friends. Your life is better for it.

But what fucking growth, you know? I'm proud of myself for not immediately relapsing. This would have sent me down a spiral three years ago. I'm going to keep not smoking, obviously, but wow. That could have gone really badly, but it didn't.

Maybe I'm just lucky.

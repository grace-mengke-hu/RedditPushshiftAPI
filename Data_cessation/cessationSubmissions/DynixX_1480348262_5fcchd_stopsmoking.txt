As a person that stops smoking every year from November till March here are a few tips on how to stop smoking...

First off, some background about my smoking habit. I've been a smoker for 6 years now, smoking half a pack a day consistently, 7 months a year. 

The reason I don't smoke from Nov till March is because I absolutely loathe smoking when it's cold. You look like a retard standing outside in the rain and cold trying to get a few more puffs. 

Now how do I stop every year, cold turkey and have no problems? First off, as the last pack buy the worst brand of cigarettes possible. For me, this is Camel.  It will be absolutely horrible trying to finish the pack and you'll actually throw away half the pack and you'll hate the idea of smoking another cigarette for a day minimum. Now we're onto the next step, which is staying at home for two days. Avoid contact with smokers. The first two days are crucial. In these two days put yourself in the mindset of a person that will be able to afford that jacket or those pair of sneakers you've been eyeing for a long time now. Another handy trick for not smoking is buying a fuck ton of bubblegum and whenever you get the urge to smoke, just chew bubblegum. It maybe sounds retarded but it's pretty fuckin efficient. Oh and if you're looking to stop smoking I highly recommend stopping during the colder months. Not to mention the extra influx of cash for Christmas and new year ;) 

I've been smoke free for 28 days now and it was piss easy. I probably forgot something and if I did I'll make sure to write it in the comments. Good luck everyone, this is the best time to stop. :)

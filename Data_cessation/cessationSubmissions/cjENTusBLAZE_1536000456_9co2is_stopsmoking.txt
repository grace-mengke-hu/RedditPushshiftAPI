Since quitting , how many packs do you think youâ€™ve smoked ? Be honest.

I quit officially back in March havenâ€™t smoked a cig since (marijuana is a different story) 

Honestly I think I smoked 45 ish packs since 2012 (when I started smoking cigarettes)

And if I do the math thatâ€™s like over 800 individual cigarettes Iâ€™ve smoked ðŸ˜¨ðŸ˜¨


Itâ€™s kind of sickening really

That amount of shit I put in myself consciously is kind of an mental illness 


Iâ€™m FUCKING glad I stopped

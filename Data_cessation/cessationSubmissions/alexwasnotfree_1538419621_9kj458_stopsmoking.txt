Hard time not smoking when going out

I've smoked for about 6 years but the last 2 years but I've cut it down to only smoking on the weekends. I have no problem not smoking during the week but once the weekend starts I smoke a whole pack during it. 

I just can't seem to go out and control myself does anyone have any advise?

I really want to quit this time, I've realized I'm an addict and that I'm actually hurting myself and that I've got to stop

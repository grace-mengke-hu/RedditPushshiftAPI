One helpful thought (at least for me)

Hey guys, I am currently 12 days smoke free and I thought intensively about smoking and its' consequences. One thought, which crossed my mind  , really helped to motivate me. 
I thought to myself that if I was to get sick, I would have to blame myself for my unthoughtful and reckless treatment of my health, all the pain, which my death would cause - I'd be responsible for that.
I admit that it is a very simple thought, but if fully grasped, it can generate enduring motivational power, believe me. 
Hang on guys, you can do it !

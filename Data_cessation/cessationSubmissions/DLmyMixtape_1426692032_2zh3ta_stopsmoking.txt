2 weeks, too easy!

Well, I'm 2 weeks clean. I must say it was easier than I thought it was going to be. A positive mind moves mountains it seems. I got back into running as I mentioned in my initial post, I cleared 6 miles the first 7 days. And I did 10 miles the next 7. 

I've never felt better in my life and I want everyone who is struggling to quit to just do it. Don't finish that pack, fucking toss those sticks in the garbage where they belong. Stay strong brothers and sisters. 

Also sorry for the #humblebrag post, I'm just loving life at the moment.

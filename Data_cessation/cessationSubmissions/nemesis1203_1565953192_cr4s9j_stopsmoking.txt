Stopped smoking. Now I want to drink

I stopped smoking one week ago, and as last time I stopped, I really want to drink. I like whiskey. I already replaced cigarettes by whiskey in the past, the result was a seizure. Fighting now both for the cigarette and for not replacing it by whiskey. Any tips?

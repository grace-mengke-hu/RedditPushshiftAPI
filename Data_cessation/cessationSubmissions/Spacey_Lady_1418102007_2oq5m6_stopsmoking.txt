It has been 14 days.....

It has been 14 days. 2 weeks. I am stressed. All I can think about is having a cigarette. I quit because my boyfriend is quitting and really wanted me to quit with him. Of course the smoker side of me says that I wasn't ready to quit. But I obviously needed to quit. 

I want a cigarette!

Reading Allen Carr's "The Only Way to Stop Smoking Permanently".

I have just started reading this book and am pleasantly surprised. 

I got 60 pages in and started to get impatient, so I skipped through to The Instructions. But Allen Carr anticipated this and warns that short-cuts don't work. He does suggest a list of chapters to focus on for desperate people. 

And know what? Even tho I'd only read 60 pages I already had a sense the whole book was a journey which I needed to take. So I am doing that. 

What really caught my attention is that without any obvious reason, I was smoking less. Not a lot but the urge to smoke is countered by another thought - not just yet. And now I put out the cigarette half smoked.

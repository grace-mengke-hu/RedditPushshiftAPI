To throw or not to throw?

I'm 1 day into it (oh my god, the pain - but i'm trying to ignore it) My question is - Do you think its worthwhile throwing all cigarettes out, OR did you keep a packet in the cupboard? I stopped in the middle of the packed. I've cleaned up the outdoor area, ashtrays, car, lighters etc. BUT i'm going into panic mode and i kept the half packet in a draw, as a safety net i guess - a backup! NOT that i want to have one, BUT the pure fact of having them accessible lessens my panic/anxiety about it. Thoughts??

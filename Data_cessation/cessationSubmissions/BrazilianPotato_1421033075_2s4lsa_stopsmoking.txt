In 1 hour and 45 minutes it will mark 2 years

Honestly, thinking back to being a smoker seems weird and almost foreign to me. I remember how many years I spent defending my use, making excuses, thinking of it as an old companion I couldn't leave, so cliche...

But one day I just picked something and stuck with it. Any reason you choose as the starting spark, hang on to it. For me it became age vs sex. Apparently health insurance doesn't cover birth control if you're still smoking at 35... Good enough for me!

And then mental gymnastics and brainwashing.... convincing myself I could do it, no big deal, just have to be consistent and disciplined. And gum, lots and lots of gum!

Anyway, stay strong guys! I applaud you all for embarking on this challenge. It's possible, even if you don't succeed at first, just keep trying and be confident (or fake it till you make it)

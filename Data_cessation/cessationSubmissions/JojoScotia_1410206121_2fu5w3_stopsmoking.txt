A week: reflections

First: I know my flair says five days. I had my last cigarette almost exactly a week ago, and I chose to quit on Monday.

I have a chest infection, which meant that withdrawal was actually fairly easy because I was feeling crappy anyway. Didn't notice any extras.

I notice I have more energy. Whether that's because I'm healing from the chest infection, or because of the quitting smoking, I don't know. However being happier is definitely down to quitting smoking. Just recently I have hated myself for smoking. Every morning I would stop outside the bus station and think "you know if you have this it will set off your cough for the rest of the day", and then I would smoke it, and it did. I knew I was doing it to myself and that make me feel worse, because it was my fault.

Now, I'm only seven days quit, and I don't want to seem too cocky, but I feel like I've managed to take control of one element of my life, and that's not a bad start.

Tomorrow is my first day back at work since I quit, and I am not looking forward to it, because for me smoking is about routine. One at the bus station. One on the walk from the bus to work. One on my first break, two on my lunch, one on my last break. One when I get home, one before bed. Every day. I need to find something to do on my breaks instead of smoking - last time I quit I actually kept going out to the shelter, because that's where all my pals were, and I was fine - it was after I left that college that I started again - but I don't know if that's a good idea this time.

Anyway, I will stop rambling, thanks for reading.

TL;DR: had my last smoke a week ago. Happier, have more energy, worried about work.

Stress related smoking

I've been following this sub since February where I managed to quit for 2 weeks... And then the stress hit me again and I started up again. I find it extremely hard to quit while I have a very stressful job. It's my relief valve and the only time I can unwind. Stupid, I know. Even more stupid that I'm still smoking while trying to get pregnant again. So, help! 

Anyone here who has tips on how to stay "stopped" which is the hard part for me? What can I do in stressful situations that only take 5-10 minutes but can give a similar relief? Thanks in advance for any tips you might have. I also struggle with my weight a bit, so I'm so afraid to become overweight (normal now, but that could go downhill fast if chocolate replaces cigarettes)

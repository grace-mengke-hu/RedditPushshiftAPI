Day 19 - ReImagine, Rethink, Self talk...

Imagined high stress periods at work where I smoked a lot to cope with late night meetings. Then repeated the lies I use to believe and responded: Smoking does not relax me. Smoking does not relieve stress it creates stress. Smoking doesnâ€™t keep me going it is killing me. Every puff took time away from my life. I will not give up another second of my life to smoke. I will not expose my family or friends to second hand smoke. I am no longer a slave to cigarettes.

Waiting for cab, just out of day-long conference, and not smoking.

I took a few days off to attend this conference for my secret alternate career, been up since 4am, at the airport at godawful early, doing work all the way up to boarding the plane, my boss is pissed at me for not giving a better/earlier heads up, the conference material is completely triggering, and I made it through the day -- including nasty email exchange with the person I broke up with last month -- and now I am waiting for a taxi to my hotel and I'm exhausted and need a huge cry AND I'M NOT SMOKING and that's WEIRD. Because right now is EXACTLY when that would be the most natural thing for me to do. 

Instead of smoking, I am griping about it here, and *this close* to just blowing my stack at anyone, for anything. 

GRR!

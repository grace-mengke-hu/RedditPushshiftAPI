15 days and no smokes cold turkey but scared

This is strange I've smoked for almost 15 years on and off with a few years quitting here and there. Long and short ive always had a really hard time with quitting but this time was real easy so far. I've had like only 2 times were i really thought i was gonna loose it if I did not have a smoke. But other than that I feel great. Anyone else go through this?

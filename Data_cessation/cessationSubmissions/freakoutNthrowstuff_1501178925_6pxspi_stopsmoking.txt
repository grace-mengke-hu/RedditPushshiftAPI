Time flies when you're not thinking about smoking

I never thought I'd get to a point where I am now. Cigarettes take up probably less than 1% of my thoughts, whereas before it was always on my mind. It seems to get easier every day, and I feel SO much better now. 

I can't believe ive made it this far, but I'm so glad I have. It's amazing how other areas of my life have improved after I quit as well. 

Just wanted to check in and say thanks to everyone who posts to this subreddit and have a good day!

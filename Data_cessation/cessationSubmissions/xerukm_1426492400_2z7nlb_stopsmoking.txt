When I wake up, I begin another attempt at quitting, seriously trying as hard as I can this time

Greetings folks,

I never really posted on reddit, but I'm at a point in my life right now that I'm really starting to see the effects smoking is having on me, my wife, and my behavior.

I started smoking in 2010 when I got out of training as a US Navy Hospital Corpsman, I was under an incredibly amount of stress, and I was seeking an outlet, smoking quickly filled that role as I didn't have a lot of friends, was often picked on by all the instructors for being the little guy, and was overall very timid.

I admit it did help me open up a lot, and it helped me make some new friends, but that';s only because I was forced to smoke in designated areas, where it was very hard not to be social.

Now that I'm no longer in the military, I no longer have any need to smoke, I don't get any benefit from it, but yet I still continue to do it.  My wife hates it, I constantly smell, and it's getting in the way of everything I do.  I feel like I need to smoke the moment I wake up, before I go to bed, before I go *anywhere* in the car, etc.

I'm tired of it, I've tried patches, gum, ecigs, everything in the past, and it may last a day, maybe two, and then I go right back to my old ways.  I never really spoke to anyone for help, always wanted to do it by myself, maybe I was too scared to ask for help?  Most likely.

Anyways, I'm here now, I had my last cig already, and tomorrow is a fresh start.  It's going to be hard, but I know it's worth it, for my life and my family.

Thank you if you actually read all this, I'm going to try my hardest to come and talk on here if I ever have any doubts or think I may be slipping.  I look forward to making some new friends here!

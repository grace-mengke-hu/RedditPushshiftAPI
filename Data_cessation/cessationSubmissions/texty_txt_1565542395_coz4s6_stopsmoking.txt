Quitting in 3 days for the first time in 8 years.

Hello Reddit,


Smoke Free app brought me here, I have been a smoker for a little over 8 years now, with only one failed attempt to quit, which lasted few hours 🤷🏻‍♂️, it was 5 years ago, I never summoned enough willpower and courage to quit, always waiting for the perfect frame of mind and circumstances, but this time I am feeling very good about it, I’m planning to quit on the 15th, I can’t wait to open the cigarettes free life package of benefits! 
I am doing this as a part of several other goals in other areas of my life, so I’m feeling scared of the change and success but I will power through it, planning to cut it off cold turkey 😁

I am sharing this to concretize it, because I don’t want to tell my surroundings.

I’m halfway through Allen Carr’s The easy way to quit smoking, and so far it is empowering me greatly to stop, I really recommend it for everyone out there struggling with cigarettes.

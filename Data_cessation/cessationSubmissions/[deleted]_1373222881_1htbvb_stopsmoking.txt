Day Two: So anxious!

This is my second day smoke free.

I cancelled plans to go out tonight, I don't think  I could go and have a drink and not smoke.

I'm trying to keep busy doing housework but all I can think of is smoking!  I keep talking myself out of it, I went out for a jog to relax myself.  But still.  It's soo frustrating.

Everywhere I go, everything I do, I crave my little rituals.

Thanks for listening to me vent.

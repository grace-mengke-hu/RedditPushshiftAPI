I quit smoking today, thanks to my friend

So yeah I used to smoke rolled cigarettes for about 4 years, today my friend rolled from my stuff and he lost my stuff somewhere while we were in a park and I decided to quit then and there because I thought the stuff was useless anyway so no reason to get upset. Also I have a question, when will the cravings go away? I know that the first 2 weeks are tough but I think I'm tougher.

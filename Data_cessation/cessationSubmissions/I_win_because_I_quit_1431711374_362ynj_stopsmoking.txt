Something I just noticed

I am just about zero percent anxious and restless while at work now that I've quit. I usually get up once an hour for a smoke but over the last two weeks, I've gotten up less and less. Today, I haven't been out of my seat once.

I still want to get up and go for my regular walks but I'll need an alarm instead of the nicotine telling me.

This is getting better and better!

Sorry for the teeny victory post but it really is nice getting my life back :D

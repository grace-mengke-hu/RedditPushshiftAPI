To smokers who have quit, are there any of you that have been able to enjoy an occasional cigarette?

I know the deal, and I'm not going back. Almost 5 months now. It's more just out of curiosity, if there are any former regular smokers who were able to end up quitting then enjoying a cigarette once maybe every 2 years or had 2 over 10 years, for example. There have to be those few rare people.

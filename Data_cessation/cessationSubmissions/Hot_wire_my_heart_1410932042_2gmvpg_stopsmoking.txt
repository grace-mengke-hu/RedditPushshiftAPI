I am officially a non smoker!

And I can honestly say this past 30 minutes has just been the best half hour of my life. 

In all seriousness, attempting to quit for what I reckon will be the third time. The first time attempt lasted not even a week, the second about a month...which then lapsed into social smoking and of course before long I was back to being a full time chimney. 

I have a few questions anyway,

1) Which milestones are the best?

2) Will I have difficulty sleeping?

3) At work, what do you do to replace the smoke breaks?

Here I go anyway...just had another while writing this...my last!

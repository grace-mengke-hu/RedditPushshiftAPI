Reasons for quitting?

Oddly enough it's not related to health. I would happily continue to smoke if i didn't find it effected my cardio endurance when running and make my hands/breathe stink of smoke

I find the 4mg nicorette lozenges amazing and can't imagine a life where i'm not consuming nicotine. I definitely think I miss the social aspects of smoking the most.

Note I've not yet managed to completely quit but I am trying. I've tried around 10 times in the past and i'm currently on day 3. It's always after I've had a few drinks that i crumble and buy another packet. It feels like I could only quit smoking permanently if I quit drinking altogether which is a big ask.

I'm interested in hearing about other peoples motivations for quitting.

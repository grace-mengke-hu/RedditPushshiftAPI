Why do I want a cigarette when I find out medical issues?!

Why do I want a cigarette so bad?  I went to my cardiologist today to find out my heart rate is low. Normally I have a problem with my heart rate being too high at times. I have had a cardiac ablation,  which 2 years later my SVT came back, and now my heart rate is low...WTH! I know it is stress.

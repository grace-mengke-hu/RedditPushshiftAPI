I am drunk right now

And I don't feel like smoking. This is a huge victory for me. I started smoking and drinking pretty much at the same time so I really don't know what it's like to do one without the other. I'm on my 5th day without a cig. I started smoking in 2007. I know it's a short amount of time compared to others, but I wasn't sure I would be able to beat this. I have, and I feel great!

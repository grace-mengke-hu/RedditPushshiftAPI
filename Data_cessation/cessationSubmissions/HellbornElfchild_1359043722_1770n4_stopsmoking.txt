500 Days!

Nice Big Old number, I had no idea until I checked here! Haha. Keep at it people.

Funny side note, The other day we were playing frisbee and my roomate asked me to hold his cigarette for him while he took a throw, and I felt like I had no idea how to hold it / what the hell to do with it. It was the most pleasurable awkwardness I've ever felt!

I'm on the verge of slipping

I'm 7 days off nicotine now. My first attempt at quitting. Except for day 3, anything went very smooth.

Usually, I handle cravings very easy, but today is my first time out in the last week. Today is also the day that a very important soccer match (Real Madrid - FC Barcelona) will be played, a match where I used to smoke around a pack while played.

Bring me to my senses, please.

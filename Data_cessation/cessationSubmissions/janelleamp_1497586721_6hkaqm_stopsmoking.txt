Millionth time quitting

Well... that is an exaggeration. But I have quit too many times to count. Been successful for up to 10 months. I always am totally fine until I drink. A couple alcoholic beverages and I no longer care, then Im smoking when I drink, then it's a slippery slope right back into every day. I currently only smoke when I drink again, but I need some help. If anyone with a similar issue who has overcome it feels like sharing how they've done it, that would be great!

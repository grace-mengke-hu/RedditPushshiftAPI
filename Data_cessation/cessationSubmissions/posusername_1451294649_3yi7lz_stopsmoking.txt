Should I ask my doctor for Chantix?

I'm 24 (will be 25 in a week) and have been smoking for almost 9+ years. I'm sick of every aspect of smoking. The cost, the just recently smoker's cough, the smell, the addiction, everything. I've tried the gum before and it only made me nauseous, cold turkey is a joke for me because I have no willpower for it. I made an appointment with my doctor for the 7th and am going to ask him if Chantix is something that will be good for me. Does anyone have any advice, thoughts or stories regarding the drug?

5 days smoke free! Needing some info.

Hello everyone! I smoked for 5 years and quit cold turkey 5 days ago. I honestly haven't had too many intense cravings. A cigarette will just cross my mind here and there. I say no to anyone that offers and I'm very proud of that. But anyway, I've noticed a huge difference in my energy levels. After getting up and starting my day I'm so full of energy then I totally crash. I'm suuuuper tired and find myself wanting to go by 8. Is this normal? I've been chugging water and herbal teas also.

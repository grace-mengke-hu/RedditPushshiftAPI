Day One

Hi r/stopsmoking.  This will be a tough day. I have my 17-day badge over in r/stopdrinking, and I'm motivated by my progress with one addiction for another.

I am 27 years old, and I've been smoking for about 7 years. My lungs feel and sound like shit. I'm embarrassed by the odor, and I wake up coughing my head off nearly every night now. I'm ready to quit, but it feels more daunting than quitting the booze.

I am going about this with e-cigs right now. I have two friends who quit recently and started vaping, and the blu e-cigs are a cheap and easy way to get the same throat hit as a real cigarette. I know e-cigs aren't methods for quitting and it is technically just another form of addiction, but it's certainly better than the alternative.

I look forward to getting to know some of you in this fantastic subreddit, and thank you in advance for your support!

Question about nicotine patches (and similar help)

I was finally done with smoking. 7 complete months I was smokefree. And then I picked it up again this summer, together with weed and porn again.

Today, I'm 14 days clean of weed and porn and I feel great improvements. But now that I'm sober again most of the time (I drink a beer at night if I want), that last burden begins to itch again. Cigarettes.

In my previous quitting attemps, I've had serious withdrawal issues in the first weeks and being in the final year or my masters degree, I don't really want those weeks of having no concentration at all.

So I would like to ask, has anyone had any experience with using nicotine patches in the period after quitting? And did you had any significant withdrawal issues, or were they much less than without the help?

Thanks in advance!

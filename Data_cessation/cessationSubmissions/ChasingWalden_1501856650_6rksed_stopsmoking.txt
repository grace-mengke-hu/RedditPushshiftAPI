17 Days: my daughter asked if I had a French manicure :)

Rewards continue to stack up. My fingernails look so pretty that I decided not to paint them after my daughter's accidental compliment. My smile is definitely getting brighter as well. 

And energy is through the roof this week. Running a 10k in the morning, then painting my great room and hallways this weekend! My house is cleaner than it has been in years. 

Still on 7mg patch, lozenges as needed (same as how I started the quit). No cravings, but I have the "notion" to smoke come up unexpectedly. I worked on a client project for four hours yesterday, and sitting that long at a computer was triggering. I just got up and ate some veggies, changed the wash, etc. 

Motivation is going up, procrastination down. 

The best: I'm more present for my kids and my life. 

Hoping for a PR in my race tomorrow for extra motivation :)

Happy weekend! Don't smoke with me, okay? We got this...none of us are "special" and unable to quit (that was the pouty lie I always told myself). If I can do it after 21 years at two packs...

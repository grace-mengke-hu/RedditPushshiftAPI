The thing that upsets me most about quitting

I never use my patio furniture anymore :-/ even here in Phoenix it's like 60 degrees outside and i'm like "meh, I don't need to go sit outside in the cold" 

:-D haven't sat outside to have a smoke in over a month and this is the only downside i've found.

Just quite

I am 24 years old and i have been smoking for over a decade. At my worst i was 2 packs a day, on average it was a pack a day. I stopped smoking 36 hours ago, the cravings come and go not as bad as i thought they would be. What is killing me is the trigger of going on break at work and not smoking. So my question to everyone here is when do the triggers go away if ever?

I lost

I was smoke free for 15 days, but suddenly and unexpected I started to get very intense and long cravings (2days) non stop. I smoked again and it felt like my 1 st cigarette, I felt the pressure on my lungs. This showed me how much my body healt in 2 weeks. I want to try again soon and need some advice whether its usual to crave more days after a 2 weeks smoke free?

Stop the insanity!

I've quit and started again many times.  Almost every weekend lately im thinking to myself this is the one and I cave.  I have a 3 day weekend now and 3 cigs left.  When they are gone I'm done! 

This summer has been rough money wise.  I smoke 1.5 packs a day and they are $15 a pack.  I don't have that much extra cash amd have been dipping into my line of credit which I hate.  Getting rid of this expense would make all the difference in the world.

27 days smoke free!!!

27 days smoke free!!! Never felt better. Cravings are already gone and I don’t think about smoking everyday as I used to. 
It seems like yesterday when I was posting here about how much i wanted to quit this ADDICTION. 
Really proud to tell that I am a non smoker! I can’t thank everyone enough who responded to my previous story, it made me feel stronger than my fears.

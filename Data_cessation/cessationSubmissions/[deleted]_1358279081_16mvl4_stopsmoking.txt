Old habits die hard...

I've been smoking for longer than a 25 year old would ever like to admit. I've gone through periods of quitting, be it 24 hours or four months, but I always find myself back in it. I'm going to try again starting Thursday. 

The best points I can give for the most success:
1. Stay very far away from bars, drinking, and smoking friends, at least for a little while. Chances are after the first beer you'll be bumming a smoke.

2. Don't tell yourself "I'll only smoke socially now" because suddenly those packs start appearing frequently.

3. Don't give up if you smoke one. Just be angry with yourself for the minute, but don't throw in the towel. You can still handle it.

I know these are simple and we've all had them hammered into our brains a thousand times, but I found they really work. I always fall backwards after a few months and I find myself tempted at the silliest times. I recently started again when I hit a deer and damaged my car. I used it as an excuse to buy a pack and said "just this one, while I'm stressed." and here I am today, still smoking away. I need to tell myself, "smoking is not going to fix the car. What logic does this serve?"

That's my ramble. Wish me luck. :)

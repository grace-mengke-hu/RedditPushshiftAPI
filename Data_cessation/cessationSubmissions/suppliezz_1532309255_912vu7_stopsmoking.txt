Remembering the Why

I've coasted on cruise control for the better part of my adult life, and these days I've really begun to feel the effects of having been so complacent all these years. I often feel utterly ill-equipped to face the challenges of work, finances, self-maintenance, &amp; social life. I frequently doubt and question every decision and action I take. Self-confidence is at an all time low. 

This kind of stress has been cripplingly paralyzing. Most days I have a hard time getting out of bed before work until the very last minute.

I'm quitting smoking because right now this is the ONE THING I know that is absolutely a positive change in my life. I can doubt my decisions and actions in all other respects of life, but I do not doubt this.

I know that by conquering just this one habit, I am slowly but surely building a happier, healthier life.

Good luck and keep up the good fight!

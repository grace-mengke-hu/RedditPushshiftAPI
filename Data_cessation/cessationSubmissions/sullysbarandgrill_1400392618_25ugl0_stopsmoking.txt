first time back in town

So I had to spend about a week in the hospital due to a real nasty case of pneumonia, which I've attributed mostly to smoking a pack a day pretty consistently for the better part of 2 years. After my stay in the hospital, I left the city my college is in and went back to my Mom's house while I recovered and naturally didn't smoke during any if that time. 
Tonight is the first time I hung out with my friends back in my college town who all also smoke and over the course of the night watched them smoke countless cigs and a blunt at the end of the night and I resisted joining in on any of it. It was so hard to not ask anyone to bum me a smoke, but I stayed strong. Tomorrow will be 1 month 16 days smoke free, and thankfully not day 0.

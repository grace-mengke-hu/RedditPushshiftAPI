At a bar surrounded by smokers

I work for the promotions department at a radio station. Tonight, my job brings me to a bar. I have to sit here for two hours sucking up second hand smoke. This is the first bar I've been to since I quit ten days ago. It's put me in the worst mood. I hate being here right now. Someone tell me it's worth it

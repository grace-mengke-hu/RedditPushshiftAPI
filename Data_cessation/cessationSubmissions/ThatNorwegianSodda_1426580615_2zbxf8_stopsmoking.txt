"Forgot" that i quit smoking

Haha kind of misleading title, but no worries. This is a happy post. So today i forgot that i had quit smoking for like... 5 hours maybe? something like that. And it felt so good when i realised! It gave me the hope that; Shit! I can continue doing this! Eventually im gonna lose ALL cravings completely!! 

Im just really happy and i wanted to share, perhaps inspire someone ;) <3

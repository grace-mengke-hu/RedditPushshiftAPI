Day 900

Holy sh*t, I just realized this. 

Smoked for about 15 years. After 2 years of cutting back my habit to social events, I officially quit smoking when I found out I was pregnant. My kids are 10 months now and I am still going strong. Also, I've only had booze 3 times since they were born, and never drunk.

THANK GOD!!!!

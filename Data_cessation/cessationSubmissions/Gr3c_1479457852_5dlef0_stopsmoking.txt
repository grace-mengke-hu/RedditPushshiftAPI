I want to help my teacher quit smoking. Need help !

My philosophy teacher started smoking about a year ago.
I got worried about him and wanted to do something, I'm planning to slip a paper between his books without him noticing, what should it contain ? 

I want something simple, I thought of drawing or writing short words. What should they be ? You as a smoker or quitter, what is it that after you read it or saw it (coming from a student ), you will be able or was able to fight smoking and stop ?

If you have any other advice please don't hesitate. Thanks in advance.

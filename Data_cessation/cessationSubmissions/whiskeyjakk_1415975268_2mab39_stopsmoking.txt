I'm finally quitting.

Alright this is my "I'm actually quitting this time" post. I have tried to quit many times in the last year but have always relapsed as the people around me smoked. Now that I am unemployed I am finally able to barricade myself away from smokers and can actually try and give this a real shot. 

I'm a less than a pack a day smoker for the last 5 years. I quit for 3 months 2 years ago, but relapsed. I'm still kind of mad about that but but hey! Not much I can do about it now except for quit for good this time. 

So here it is, Day one. 7 Hours not smoked, 4.6 cigs not smoked, 1 hour of life regained. 

I can do this.

Quit smoking over 6 months ago

Smoked for 6 years and Quit smoking after New Years cold turkey, the first few months were terrible and I continued having small cravings up until recently where I now have very little thoughts or interest in smoking. Only thing is it's been over 6 months and I'm still coughing up yellow brownish mucus every few mornings, is it likely this is still from smoking and how long can it last for?

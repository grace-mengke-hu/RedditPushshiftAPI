First day as a non-smoker!

Hi all,

glad to have found this sub, it seems everyone is pretty friendly here :) Today is my very first day of not smoking - I have actually never tried quitting before. I used to be a social smoker (so like, every two weeks, 5 an evening) but over the past two years I've been having anything between five a day, to a pack a day. So done with that! I hope I can keep up the non-smoking, I think going out and drinking will def create some cravings...
Will surely come back here often to read about your inspiring journeys!

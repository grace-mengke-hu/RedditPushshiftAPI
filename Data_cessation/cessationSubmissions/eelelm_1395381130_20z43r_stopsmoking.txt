I broke down..

I was cigarette free for over 3 months, but things have started to get stressful, so i went out and bought a pack. I haven't really wanted to smoke until now. It feels like i can't deal with things without smoking. I feel disappointed in myself, but relieved. I know i should just throw it out,  but the pull is strong. Here's to hoping i throw them out tomorrow morning.

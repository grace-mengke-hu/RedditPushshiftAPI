dating a smoker

I was 7 months smoke free and I met a new beau. I am head over heels so breaking up isn't an option, but he's a smoker and I have relapsed. Any suggestions on restarting and staying smoke free while dating someone who smokes? 

He only smokes when he is drinking, and I fell into that same trap, but now I am smoking all the time. I am about to head out of town on a family vacation for four days and won't be able to smoke then, but when I get home I need some heeeelllllpppppp.

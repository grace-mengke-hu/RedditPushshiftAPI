Just hit two weeks and I have a question

I'm a 30 year old male who smoked since I was 15 or so. I would say 4-5 packs a week on average at most. Since I quit I really haven't noticed to many changes. Smell, taste, lungs all that seems to be the same. Is this weird? Also I really don't crave them other than the first day I quit. I would say the only thing that has changed is when I smell one now I think they stick instead of lighting up. I can't stop thinking that something is like wrong with me I know that sounds weird but I haven't seen anyone else with this same kind of things happen to them.

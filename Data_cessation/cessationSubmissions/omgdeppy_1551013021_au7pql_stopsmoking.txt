Went to the park to get fresh air and sun. Unfortunately there were clouds...

The group hanging out next to me had a chain smoker and naturally the smoke goes all in my direction. What a truly disgusting smell. I can't believe I used to be the one to ruin someone else's park experience.

That was the first time the word "smoking" entered into my mind today, 4 hours after I woke up. That's definitely progress.

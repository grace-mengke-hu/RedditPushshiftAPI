Spontaneous decision to quit

I'm 27 and I've been smoking for 5 years (wow, time flies..). On regular days, I smoke 3-5 cigarettes. When I'm drinking or hanging out with smoker friends, I can smoke up to 10 in one hour.
I know I am not the heaviest smoker around, but I can see the damage it is doing to my body - nasty stains behind my front teeth, my skin has a yellowish tinge.. I have to constantly chew gum to hide my bad breath and in the mornings I wake up with a terrible taste in my mouth. Not to mention, my clothes and hair smell terrible. And I can feel the nasty gunk in my lungs when I exercise.

Despite all this, I truly LOVE smoking. There is nothing more appealing than my morning ritual of black coffee and a cigarette. And there are a hundred little rituals in my life that involve smoking - smoking on the fire escape when it's raining, smoking out in nature when the sun is shining, smoking while waiting for the train on my way home, smoking while reading a good book in an outdoor cafe, etc.

But today I decided to quit. In the past few months I have made many life-changing decisions - I have changed my diet and stopped binge-eating, I have started exercising. I am learning to bike and swim, and I want to do a triathlon next year. Smoking has no part in the way I want to live my life. So I am quitting. Today. It won't be easy - I live with smokers, most of my family and good friends are smokers. But I am going to push through it, because I don't like the thought of addiction. I want to be liberated from this nasty habit.

A lot of text, but I needed to share this with someone. So, I just smoked my last cigarette!

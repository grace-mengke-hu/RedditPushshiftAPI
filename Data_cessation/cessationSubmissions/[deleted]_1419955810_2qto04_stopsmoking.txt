197 days and counting

I'm not gonna lie, this month has easily been the toughest one of my life. Lots of sleepless nights, anxiety, panic attacks and temptations. Currently eating 3 different medicine to even get some sleep. 

It's hard to resist but i'm going to survive without a smoke. If i can do it, you can do it!

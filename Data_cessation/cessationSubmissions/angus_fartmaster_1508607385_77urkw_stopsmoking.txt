Vapes worth it or just another vice? (trigger warning)

I *really* enjoy cigs, I smoke 8-12 American Spirits a day and have for about a year (started off 2-3 a day after High School) but I'm starting to feel more and more dependent and shitty in terms of health. I don't tend to feel too winded when swimming or after running or anything, but the effects are becoming more noticeable. 

I have heard a mixed bag when it comes to the efficacy of using a vape to taper off. Some say it works, others seem to think it's useless. I don't want to quit cold turkey because I have a fair amount of depression and a rather addictive personality (taco bell, video games, weed ...) Vaping is also a pretty hefty investment and not quite as convenient for me. 

Any anecdotal arguments from you guys? Thanks.

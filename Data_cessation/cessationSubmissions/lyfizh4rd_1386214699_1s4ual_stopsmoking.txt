Quit 4 days ago, need some advice

So far I have proven I can be places that sell smokes and not buy a pack, I can occupy myself with distractions when I have a craving, and I can even sit out with the smokers at work on our breaks without wanting one.

I am worried, however, about certain friends of mine that smoke. They can be pretty influential and whenever we hang out, we usually drink. My question is; how long should I wait to test myself with drinking, and when I do what are some good things to remember while having a few beers?

I decided to quit smoking yesterday, because something bad is inevitable.

Yestetday I decided to stop smoking cigarrettes. My initial thought was that if I continue to keep smoking cigarettes.. something bad WILL happen. It's not a matter of it may happen. I always hear these stories about somebody and their grandma who lived to be 120 years old and she smoked since she was three kind of stories. And I think it's all just bullshit. I feel so unhealthy. I stay awake at night because it's hard to breathe in my sleep. My throat is killing me. If I don't stop for good, I will hear some bad news eventually. I still could for all I know, but I'm putting an end to the whole charade. I've almost gone a whole 24 hours without a cigarette. Wish me luck.

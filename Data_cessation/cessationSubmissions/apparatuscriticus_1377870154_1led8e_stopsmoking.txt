100 days

Well /r/stopsmoking, I did it. One hundred days. Perhaps today is the hundredth and I've 24 hours to go. 

I attribute my success to:

1) Truly wanting to quit. The dislike of the habit has to significantly outweigh the desire to light up.

2) Food. It has helped a lot to be able to indulge in something to take my mind off of it. It's usually something simple, maybe some vegetables or lemonade with chopped ice.

3) Encouragement from my girlfriend.

4) Willpower.

5) Health. Going to the gym and watching my body recover. 

6) Wanting the stains on my fingers gone. Watching them go was awesome and keeping them gone was even better.

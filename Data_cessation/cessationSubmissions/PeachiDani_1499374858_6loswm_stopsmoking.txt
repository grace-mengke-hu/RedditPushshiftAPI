90 days.

Came to check my flair and I'm so relieved. I have not had the urge to smoke a cigarette in a while. I know many think that vaping is just a substitution, but it has truly helped my fiance and I. We went from 24 mg of nicotine to 0. We finished our liquid a week ago and have stopped vaping all together, honestly because it just became a hassle. We have saved an immense amount of money and thrown it into savings, which has come in handy because my fiance was recently laid off. 

I'm so happy to not smell like cigarettes anymore. Whenever I'm around my dad and he lights up a cigarette, I gag. My three year old son won't have to endure what I did growing up, living in a smoky house, going to school smelling like cigarettes, friends telling him he stinks, friends parents judging his parents for smoking. It was shitty, and the main motivation for me to quit. He shouldn't have to deal with that for such a stupid habit I chose to take back up after I gave birth (still regret that, how pointless).

I hope I didn't offend anyone. If you're still smoking and thinking about quitting, I believe in you. I wish all of you the best of luck in your journey to find the motivation to quit, do it, and keep going. It's not easy. But for me, it got easier.

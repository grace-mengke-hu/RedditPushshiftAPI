1 month in cold turkey and I've finally noticed how bad smokers smell

I quit cold turkey a month ago. Whenever I get into my elevator at work, there are usually people coming back from a smoke. The small space made me really how truly strong that stench was. 

I've also been successfully able to spend time talking to smokers without a cigarette in hand during a break. The smell of it has become repulsive. I can't believe I used to compulsively smoke for 8 years and smelled like this!

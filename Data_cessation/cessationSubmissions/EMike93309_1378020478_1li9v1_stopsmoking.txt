Dumb question, but after 13 years at a pack a day I've gotta ask...

Smoking is such a defining part of my adult life, that it seems impossible to quit. Nevertheless, 2 kids and 17 years later (13 years at a pack a day) I've got a date in mind and I'm planning on calling my doctor for some help doing it right this time.

After a workplace without smoke, my second biggest obstacle is the social aspect; there is literally nothing more relaxing to me than good company with a cigar followed by a couple of cigarettes. Has anyone ever successfully cut their smoking down to, say, once every month-or-two with friends? Or am I kidding myself thinking it's possible to turn a lifelong addiction into an occasional recreational activity?

Edit: Thanks guys, I didn't think so.

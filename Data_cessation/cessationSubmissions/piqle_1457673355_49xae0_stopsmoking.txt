Cold turkey or slow down?

I've been smoking since about 12 years old (I know, I know...) I'm 21 now and I really really want to quit smoking. I've been on and off drugs through-out my teenage years and I can really feel the toll everything is starting to put on me. I'm just wondering was it easier for you guys just to suck-it-up and quit or did you slowly progress until you completely stopped? I don't want to use any alternatives, I just want this to be over with.

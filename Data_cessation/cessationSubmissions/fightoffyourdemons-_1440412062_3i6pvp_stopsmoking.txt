I'm on a coach, an hour into a 4 hour journey

It's nice not being anxious at the thought of going so long without a smoke. I can just sit and get lost in my book, and when I get there I can get going with the next leg of my journey, rather than chain smoking outside the bus station. 

It's the little things :)

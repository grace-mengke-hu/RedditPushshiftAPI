In the car? [Rant]

The time I feel the need to smoke the most is when I'm driving in the car. Closely followed by being bored, which is often, I have a very short attention span and the second I'm bored I go to, "oh, well, might as well smoke."

How do you get past these urges?
So far, its been fine, since I'm currently in a car for no more than 10 minutes a day for ~5 minutes at a time. But I'll be starting a new job soon, so that's apt to change.

The biggest thing at the current moment is the relentless boredom I'm always having. Nothing works. I can't just pick up my phone and browse reddit or something and be fine, because even then I would take it outside with me.

Fiance tells me I need a hobby but every hobby I pick up, I get bored with quickly (that damn attention span) or I get so frustrated that I want a smoke.

I do read a lot, but even then, before I swore off anymore cigarettes, I would just carry my book outside with me. Since I quit, I haven't picked up my book in fear of it making me want to go out and smoke. ):

How do all of you lovely people get past the car rides and periods of boredom?

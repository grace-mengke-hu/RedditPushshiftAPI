One week into quitting and I'm realizing how serious smoking is

I never fully realized the chemical addiction that comes with smoking.

For me smoking was mostly a habit, I liked going outside and smoking, driving and smoking, taking a break from homework and smoking, etc.  So I got a new gf who is disgusted by it so I figured why not try quitting, I don't depend on it for my happiness, it was just a thing I enjoyed.

But now one week into having quit, I'm sitting here with the chills, a cough, runny nose, random bad headaches, and mild nausea.

I did not expect my body to get chemically addicted to cigarettes, like I thought this was reserved for people who get addicted to cocaine or heroin or meth... If anything this makes me want to quit even more, and if anyone is on the fence about it, hopefully this can help push you over before it gets even more serious.  This shit is fucking serious!

Anyway, happy new year everyone!  And if your gonna have a cig tonight, just bum one, don't buy a pack!!

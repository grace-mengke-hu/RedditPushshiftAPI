Just Need to Vent!!

I had my last ciggy at 4am on Sat morning. It has been almost three days. I am going crazy!! I just want to smoke! Really bad! 

I keep thinking about how it doesn't matter, and how much I want that damn cig. I am super sleepy, hungry, and cant stop putting my foot in my mouth!

I just want this all to end. The depression is over the roof. JESUS!!

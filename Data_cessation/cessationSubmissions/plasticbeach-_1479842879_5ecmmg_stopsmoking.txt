Advice on quitting

I'll be getting a new puppy soon and I really want to quit, as I don't want him inhaling second hand smoke. I'm 21 and I've been smoking since June. I used to smoke 1/5-1 pack of Malboro Golds a day, sometimes 2 packs (when I had a boyfriend). Switched to RYO about a month ago and now I smoke 5-10 rollies a day. I tend to smoke a lot more when I'm stressed or socialising with friends and that's what worries me. All my friends smoke and I see it as a bonding/ritual type of thing. 
My plan is to gradually cut down and then either try vaping/nicotine patches or quit completely, but I'm not sure if it'll work. 
I think it's my mindset because I don't want to quit, I just have to. 
Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

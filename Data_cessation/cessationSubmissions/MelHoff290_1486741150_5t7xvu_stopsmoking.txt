Non-smoker and Runner

I'm on day 102 as a non-smoker. (After 19yrs of a pack a day habit) I've also been training for a 5k run. Wow...never thought I would be able to say that!!! I'm pretty proud of myself. But don't get me wrong...I still think about smoking and I still have occasional cravings. But have my given in!

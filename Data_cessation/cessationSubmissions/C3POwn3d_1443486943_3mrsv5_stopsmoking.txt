I broke :(

So I didn't even last 24 hours. I'm a pack a day smoker. I hate this so much, I want to quit so badly. I want to start running again (I ran XC and track in high school), I want to smell again, I want to feel good again. I have depression and am getting back on anti depressants here in a few weeks when I see a psychiatrist. I want to have stopped by then. I know cold turkey is a method but I don't think I can do it. I don't have a car at the moment so I can't go to the store to pick up some nicotine gum. I feel trapped. I just want to get better.

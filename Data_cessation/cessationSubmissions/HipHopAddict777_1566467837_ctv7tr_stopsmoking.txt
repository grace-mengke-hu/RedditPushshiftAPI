Tips on quitting vaping

So I quit smoking cigs regularly about 4 or 5 months ago. I was probably up to a pack and a half a day. I picked up vaping (like most) thinking it'd be the lesser of 2 evils (besides i got tired of reaking of ciggs). So i picked up a vape and a bottle of nic salts and ended up changing my pack a day habit into 3 35mg 2ml pods per day. I feel like i just replaced one with the other. Hearing all this stuff in the news about vapes scares me even more so please any advice would be great! Thank you guys in advance and much love to everyone quitting out there!

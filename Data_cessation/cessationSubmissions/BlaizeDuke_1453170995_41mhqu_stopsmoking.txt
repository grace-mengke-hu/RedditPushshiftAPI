I'm so excited, I finally ran a mile without having to walk any of it!

So I stopped smoking a week ago and its been pretty easy mostly because I got into the gym. 

So the first day I decided to warm up by taking laps around the track (12 laps = mile) to give you an idea of the size. 

Well I made it 3 laps and I was gasping for air had to drink water and walk two laps to cool off.

Well today just 1 week later I ran the 12 laps, wasn't sure if maybe I miscounted but it was at 8:30 so I ran another lap and finished it in 9 min. The amazing part I wasn't gasping for air yet so I decided to run another lap before giving myself a break. 

I don't think I've ever run a full mile straight in my life (granted I hadn't really tried before I started smoking). But I felt so good after this I went and played some basketball with some friends.

I love the way my body feels, the way I can breathe, and how much energy I have. I am so happy to no longer be smoking!

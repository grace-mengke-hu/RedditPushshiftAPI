Update, DAY #7

Well the talk with my girlfriend went well.
All my rules have been followed from no smoking in the cars or house to not smoking after eating. 

I have had only one craving on day 2 (very stressful day at work and got home to more stress) and I took a drag off my buddies joint of marijuana and haven't had a craving at all since. 

My SO is still smoking but now that I'm not and she can't smoke indoors and after we go out to eat, she's cut back from almost a pack a day to about a half a pack. 

Here was my original post, 
DAY #1

So the first week was so easy it was just the first day that was tough to break the routine. An for me cold turkey worked. 
I don't have the slightest desire to smoke a cigarette also the smell of cigs makes me want to throw up now omg they smell like ass. 

My GF will go out side to smoke and come back in and I can't even be near her bc she stinks so bad and now she is realizing it bc I tell her, she can't smell it bc she's smoking still but I sure can and I voice my concerns over the stench..and she's starting to see the nasty effects of a cigarette. 

THANKS TO ALL YOU GUYS/GALS FOR THE MOTIVATION AND INSIGHT!!!! Keep it up we can quit it's just how bad do you want it.

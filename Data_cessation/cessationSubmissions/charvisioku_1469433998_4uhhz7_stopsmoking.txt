First Time Quitter - Tips?

So I've finally decided to quit smoking tobacco after realising today I've been smoking for 5 years (I was convinced it was 2, 3 max) and that I'm ruining my health/bank balance; I'm on day 1 and it's not the easiest thing I've done but I'm finding that it's mainly the "I will never smoke again" thing that's daunting me. It's so final. Any tips on making it seem less intimidating? Weirdly enough, Pokemon games are helping to take my mind off it whenever I crave - online games at home, Pokemon Go at work. I would normally use League of Legends but I directly associate that with smoking (I always smoke & game when it's LoL for some reason) so I think I need to take a break from that too... Anything else I can use as a distraction or 'replacement' when I get cravings? I have access to my fiancee's vape at lunch break and at home so hopefully that'll tide me over until pay day when I can afford my own.

Edit: Thank you all so much, your advice is helping me already. When I get a craving I look at this thread and it really motivates me seeing the progress you've all made because I know it means you're actually talking from experience. I want to get to that point and you guys have made me even more determined.

Great, I've hit Day 10. Fuck, I'm exhausted!

Hey, I need advise: yesterday, I came home and crashed on the couch at 6 pm. My husband moved me into the bedroom at 9. Woke up, tired. Feeling tired all day. I know this is more of the garbage coming out of my body. Any advice? Vitamins, etc. Oh, strange aside: coffee, I used to love coffee, I now hate it (tastes like shit) and I've inadvertently cut back on my Diet Coke addiction. I drink lots of water. I'm sleeping 6-8 hours a night, but damn, I'm exhausted! Thanks!

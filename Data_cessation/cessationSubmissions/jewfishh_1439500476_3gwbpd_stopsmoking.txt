How long do Chantix side effects last after stopping the drug?

My fiance has been a long time smoker with a few failed quit attempts over the years. Recently she was prescribed chantix and she was able to keep from smoking pretty well. I had read about the side effects and discouraged her from taking it but she insisted as nothing else had worked for her. Well she didn't get the nightmare side effects luckily, but she sure seemed to get the emotional and irritability side effects. Anyway, after being on chantix for 1.5-2.5 months she stopped taking it. This was around 2 months ago. I think she is still affected by the side effects though. She can become overly emotional about seemingly slight issues and she can get very very angry at me for things that don't seem to merit that. I never remember any episodes like these before she took chantix. Has anyone here gone through this? Can I expect the side effects to clear up in the next few months? It can be very straining between us to deal with someone who gets disproportionately irrationally angry or upset like this.

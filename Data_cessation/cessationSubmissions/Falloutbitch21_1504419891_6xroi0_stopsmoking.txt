I've been moody and miserable all day and all I want is a cig.

I haven't had a craving in days and now all of a sudden the craving is horrible! I've finally gotten past the "smokers flu" and can breathe and smell better. Why am I craving so bad now? I've been barely able to tolerate my SO today and barely held my tongue at work.

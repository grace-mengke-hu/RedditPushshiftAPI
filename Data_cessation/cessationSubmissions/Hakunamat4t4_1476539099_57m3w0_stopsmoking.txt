made a thread 1 month ago about going 2 weeks clean!

Still going strong! now i never notice any cravings, which is great. my biggest problem is still that i fell like i've become depressed or something since i quit, it's as if i cannot get myself to do the stuff i used to do. because im afraid that the things i did will make me want to smoke again. i like to model stuff in 3d and im used to smoking when i begin rendering so now i've avoided 3d modeling for over a month. watching movies or series i don't do. and another thing i did was i ate weed instead of smoking it. which i haven't quit yet. my plan was to do it for the first month. but i still fell like i have to do it... idk i dont think i will ever start smoking again but for some reason i cannot get myself to do stuff anymore.

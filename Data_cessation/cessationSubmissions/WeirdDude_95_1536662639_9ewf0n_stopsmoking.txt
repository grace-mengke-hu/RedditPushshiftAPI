Almost 7 months free of cigarettes.

And now it's time to break all free from the alternatives , i used nicotine gum mostly and normal gum for the first 2 months , but while going through a really tough time in my life i started using hookah to fight the argue of getting back to cigarettes and now it's time to go cold turkey and quit everything. 

I have gone through most of this subreddit and it really gave me a boost , Thanks guys!

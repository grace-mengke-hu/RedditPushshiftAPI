Recently started, already want to stop

Hey guys, I started smoking 6 months ago, and I'm already ready to stop. I have 3/4 of a pack in my car right now and they're calling my name. It almost seems like a waste to not smoke them at this point, as I'm pretty low on money and disdainfully bought them before drinking earlier. What should I do?

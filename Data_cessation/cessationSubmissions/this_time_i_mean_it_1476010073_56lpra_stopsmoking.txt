The planet is once again in the same exact spot, relative to our solar system, as it was when I had my last cigarette.

I hope this post isn't too self serving. If you'd like to ama, please do.

I quit cold turkey. I wasn't a heavy smoker. Half a pack a day at the most. I was down to 8 or so smokes a day before quitting but it wasn't really a conscious thing.

Not sure what else I can say. I just wanted to have a yeay! milestone. Thanks for endulging me.

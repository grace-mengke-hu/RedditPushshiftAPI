Remembering what got me through quitting smoking so I can quit another vice

I don’t remember my last cigarette. Quitting wasn’t a planned event. I was just ready to be done. I was ready to be healthy.

I remember my first run a few days later. I wore skater shoes and baggy jean shorts. I looked rediculous but didn’t care. I felt something I never felt finishing a cigarette. I felt a huge sense of accomplishment. 

I replaced smoking with running and within 14 months I was sporting a 26.2 tattoo. I’ve never looked back. 

I’m flirting with another stop sub with 52 days away from another vice. I just needed to post here and see that crazy large number. I just needed to remind myself that eventually the days/months/years can go by without thinking about old friends and wanting to visit with them again. 

I don’t remember what it is like to smoke but I remember that I once smoked. I want to be able to say that for every vice, one vice at a time.

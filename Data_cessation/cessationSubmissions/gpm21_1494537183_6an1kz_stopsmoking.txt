Shortness of breath causes

Hello, I've tried quitting once before and right now as well. I always notice whenever I wake up quitting (about 3 days in), I am gasping for air and that subsides after half an hour. There is some mucus but it feels like my lungs have more space in them so I need more breaths. Has anyone felt that before? We did have high pollen alerts and I quit last year at the same time so maybe seasonal allergies?

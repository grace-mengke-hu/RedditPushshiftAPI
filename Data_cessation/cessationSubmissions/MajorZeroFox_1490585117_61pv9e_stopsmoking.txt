Doc Says next time they will crack my chest open.

45 this year and already have 3 stints, Doc says gotta stop smoking the cigs, or be ready for open heart surgery. Damns gals, gals, and it's. Give me some hope that I am not doomed. I fell like committing a felony to get locked up, the only time I was ever successful in quitting for any length of time.

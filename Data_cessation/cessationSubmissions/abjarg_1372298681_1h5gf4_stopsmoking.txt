Day 38, going great!!

I know it's only been a little over a month but I feel like I've forgotten that I was a smoker. Cravings have literally disappeared and I need to log into reddit to find out how many days it's been. To all of you struggling through the first couple of weeks: it gets sooo much easier!! Keep going!! You're doing great! 

I have noticed some weight gain though (not much, maybe 4-5 pounds), but I'm about to nip that in the bud. 

Thanks to this community for all the support and great messages that have helped me come this far. I can't wait until day 50, then 100 :D

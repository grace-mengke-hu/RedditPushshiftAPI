Having a strange time quitting. Can't quite convince myself that I don't like cigarettes.

So I have been trying to quit cigarettes for about a week now. I quit for 2 days then relapsed on the third. Then quit for another 2 days and relapsed again. The first relapse I smoked about 5 cigarettes and threw the pack away. The second relapse I have only smoked one so far. I will quit for a few days and feel great but then get curious if I still like cigarettes and so far the answer has been sort of? How long can this go on? Will I fully relapse or are these mini relapses part of the healing process?

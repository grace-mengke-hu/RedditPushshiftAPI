Somebody should made a stop smoking RPG

That way you have these weird little incentives based on time spent not smoking, urges avoided, cigarettes not smoked, what have you. There could be HP and endurance increases, all kinds of silly things that'd tie the playable character to the real person. Maybe even a pedometer part that'd help strengthen the character's endurance. I don't know, it might help some folks.

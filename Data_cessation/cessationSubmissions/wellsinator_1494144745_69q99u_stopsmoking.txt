On ADHD meds, make me want to smoke so badly.

Meds are too important to stop taking. They let me focus normally at work and not be a manchild. But goodness, these babies make my cravings go through the roof. When I don't take them, my cravings disappear, don't want to smoke at all.

Been smoking for 12 years now and really want to quit. Anyone else go through this/ have any advice?

I haven't smoked in 5 days

I started dating a new girl who convinced me to quit, the first five days were a lot easier than I expected because my job has been working me like a dog and I've spent all my free time with this girl... but today I don't have to work until the night and I'm sitting in my house all by myself and I'm freaking out. I can't think of anything besides going down to the store and getting my favorite pack. I'm having to physically stop myself from getting in my truck.. I need advise.

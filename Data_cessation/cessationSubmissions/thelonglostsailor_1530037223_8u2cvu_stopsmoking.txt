Went out drinking with friends last night

And I didn't have one puff, and I never will again. I got super drunk, am very hungover as I write this. But I don't smell like smoke. I haven't left my bed for a morning smoke. Many people offered, and I turned them down saying "I don't smoke, but thanks!". This usually resulted in a "What?! Congrats man!". People are proud of you not smoking. They want you to succeed. Surround yourself with the right people.

365 days! What a difference!

I quit Fathers Day last year. I did it so I could be a Father for as long as possible. 

It was hard, and for me that meant distancing myself from so very much. 

At times it felt like I was giving up more than cigs, but parts of my life too. Today? I never even think about it. It's a nasty part of me that is long gone.

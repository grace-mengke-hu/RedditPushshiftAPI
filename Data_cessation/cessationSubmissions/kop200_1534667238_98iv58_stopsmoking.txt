It's time to quit nicotine altogether.

Yesterday when sitting at my friends house and chain vaping I realised that I wasn't vaping because I liked that, but because I felt the need to. They enjoyed chain vaping, while I would force myself. Kinda like forcing a meal into yourself in a restaurant. So, before I came back home I threw my vape into a trash can. I'm kind of also doing it for a woman. She's been giving me very careful and light signs that she would prefer me to quit, normally I would ignore that and say vaping is safe blah blah blah. However, she quit smoking some time ago and I feel like I might make her relapse. Wish me luck guys! I wish the best for you. Its going to be tough next two weeks.

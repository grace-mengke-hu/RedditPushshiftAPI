Hello!

Current smoker trying to quit. 

My daughter and my girlfriend both want me to quit. And god damnit I want to. 

Smoking had been the biggest thing to kill. This coming from someone who quit doing things like coke, pills, shrooms etc etc. 

I just need a comforting group to help me quit I think. Somewhere I can update frequently if this is the wrong place. Please point me to the right one. But if I have support here. Help me out.

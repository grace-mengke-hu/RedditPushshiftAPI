On day 2 of going cold turkey, need advice on how to keep busy!

So I quit Saturday.. wanted to stop for a while, and finally decided to do so! Sunday was fine as I wasn't really around any one who smoked.. 1st day at the office, horrible. This morning was bad but now in the afternoon i'm sort of OK. Can any of the people that has quit give me advice on how to keep busy?!

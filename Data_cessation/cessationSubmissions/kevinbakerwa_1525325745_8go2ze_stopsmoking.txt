Worst Feeling in the world

Been addicted to nicotine for about 2 years now (Started when i was 15).  Never smoked a cig but using the Juul and other ecigs.  I came clean to my mom and said I need help.  We talked and im starting Nicolette gum tomorrow.  The worst feeling in the world is thinking about my mom buying that Nicolette gum at the store and how she must’ve felt.  I feel like such a disappointment but I hope I can make them proud by quitting.  I don’t think kids realize how bad having and using a juul really is.  I’ve cried almost every night for the past week because I think about when I didn’t need nic to have a good time and when I didn’t always think about it.  Wish me luck.

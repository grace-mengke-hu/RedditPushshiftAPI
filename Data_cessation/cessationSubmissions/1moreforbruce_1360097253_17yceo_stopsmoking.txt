First post, for advice and science!

Hey all, I'm 27, and I've been smoking since i was 17. Some of you may remember when you turned 27 and the realization that 30 is literally around the corner smacked you in the face. Well, it did for me.

I have quit smoking cigs. I have just dumped my longest companion, my crutch. Everyone I know just laughs or shakes their head when i bring up the fact that i want to quit, so i have not told anybody. I just don't want any negative vibes tainting my process.

I have delicious tea tree toothpicks, 3 days off from work, Netflix, plenny food, and best of all, I want this badly.

Good luck and godspeed all of you beautiful men and women!

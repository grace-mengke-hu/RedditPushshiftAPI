Hey guys, I need your help

I'm currently in an Addictions Community Outreach Program post-graduate. I'm volunteering for a community group called "Smoke Free Kings Nova Scotia" and I've been asked to create a viral video about youth and e-cigarette use. I've come up with a few ideas but can anyone in this sub give me tips, advice or personal stories about e-cigarettes? Do you think they can help with quitting smoking or do they just keep the behaviour around? Any help here is appreciated.

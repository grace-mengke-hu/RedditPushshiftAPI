I fucking relapsed.

It's been two weeks since I last smoked. I used Allen Carr's book, and it was a progress - the first four times I tried to quit I couldn't do more than five days. The first week was actually very easy, but in the last few days, I've been craving so bad and well, I relapsed. I don't know what to do with myself. The cigarette tasted and felt absolutely horrible. I realised that tobacco seems appealing and enjoyable only when you're craving for it, but once you actually smoke, there is no pleasure in it... I'll probably keep this pack for the times when I'm stoned, since that is the only time when smoking actually feels nice for some reason. But I feel hopeless... Maybe getting a vape without nicotine might help?

Edit: also got a mild headache now. Fuck this shit.

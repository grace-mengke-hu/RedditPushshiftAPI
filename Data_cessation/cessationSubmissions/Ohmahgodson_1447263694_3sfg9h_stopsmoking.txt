I remember being overwhelmed seeing all the one month + posts. Now I'm at 3 and it feels great

The first time I checked this sub I was around 12 hours into my quit. Much of the first page was covered with people who had posts about being quit for a month or more. At the time that seemed CRAZY. Who can quit smoking for that long!? Well, apparently I can along with MILLIONS of other people.

Keep your head up everyone. You're doing great!

Thank you again to this sub and Allan Carr's easy way. I feel like a whole new person. 15lbs heavier no doubt, but unlike the stench, cost, and diseases that come with smoking - I can work those off!

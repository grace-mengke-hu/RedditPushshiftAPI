I have been smoking for 8 years now... Which is crazy when I stop and think about it. I am 3 days off nicotine completely.

I am worried about the anxiety factor. I have tried to quite before but I spent about 2 months getting far too angry about every little thing. I was wondering if anyone knows any tricks to help curb this. I don't want to be a tyrant and honestly marital strife is almost worse than the smoking its self.

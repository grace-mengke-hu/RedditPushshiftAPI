Day 5. vacation with the family...

I just quit smoking on Sunday, so still getting a Lotta cravings. My boyfriend quit too, which is really helping. We're using the vape, which I admit kinda feels like cheating, but no cigs in 5 days feels pretty good! Anyway, we're going out of town for the weekend to see some family, and I'm nervous about being in a pissed off mood around family I never see. I'll bring the vape, but I already know my mom disapproves of it because "the FDA thinks it could be harmful", so I don't wanna pull out the vape in front if people and get a bunch a shit. I also don't wanna be short and bitchy. Tips for when you're feeling panicked because all you want is a GD ciggerette, but you have to keep your cool because your also around a damn family reunion?

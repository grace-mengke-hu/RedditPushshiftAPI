Day one done

Hi everyone,
I have been smoking for nine years. Previously I managed to quit for two years around the time I got pregnant and had my second child. After my baby's birth I have started again and for the past one and a half year I have been smoking a lot.My intake got to one and a half pack daily.I have bipolar disorder so that's the added problem as it takes a lot of effort for me to quit. 
This time I quit on March 23rd and for almost two months it was going smoothly.For the past three days I have slipped again.I was just watching someone smoke and had intense craving.On just a spur of the moment I got my self two cigarettes.I thought they will be my last two but the next day I woke up with smoking on my mind.Despite trying not to give in by night time I gave in to cravings as I couldn't deal with them anymore.Comes the third day and from two cigarettes I was now smoking six.Yesterday I knew I am falling into the same old pattern and will just keep on increasing them.Two months ago I put in a lot of effort to quit and I am feeling quit disappointed in myself to smoke again.
Today I am again having these feelings to just go and get smokes but I know I am not going to down this path again.Smoking makes me miserable as the cigarettes have a complete hold over me and I forget everything around me.It's just smoke one and wait for the next and so on.It causes my mental health to deteriorate rapidly.
I am trying my best not to give in and have passed 24 hour mark. Any suggestion from you will be very helpful.

10+ year smoker

I have smoked for a LONG time.  For the past month I've been lurking here and trying to quit.  I've been going usually a day or two without smoking then bumming one or two or buying a pack and smoking sparingly.  Normally at this point I would say "fuck it" and just go back to smoking, but I told my wife and son I quit and sneaking a cigarette even here and there stresses me out even more.  So I just got back from the store bought the 4mg gum and holy shit is it awful!  Just driving back the few blocks to my house I wanted to puke, is it just the Target brand or is it all gum? My biggest hurdle to overcome is the "I don't know what to do now" like on breaks at work, or just sitting it home, I get bored then the craving starts then it goes down hill from there, any advice?

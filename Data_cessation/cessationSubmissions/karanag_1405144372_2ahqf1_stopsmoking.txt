Just finished my last cigarette...need to leave it for good this time

Although I am vastly experienced in the art of quitting (having quit several times in the past few years) I need to quit it for good this time. My Dr. has issued me an ultimatum, quit smoking or be blessed with a serious disease within the next few years. I have a barrage of smoking related diseases right now (nothing serious - manageable with medicines, quitting smoking and exercise)

Having tried everything from patches,gums, hypnotherapy, Chantix, and what not, this time I am trying something that is superior to all of those - motivation from reddit...

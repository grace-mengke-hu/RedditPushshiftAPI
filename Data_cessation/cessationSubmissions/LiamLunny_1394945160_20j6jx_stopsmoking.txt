Is it weird that I don't have any craving?

I'm looking on this page and seeing people who've been clean for weeks and months talking about cravings. It's been almost 6 days and I haven't had any since the day I quit. I'm not bragging, I just want to know if anyone has a possible explanation. I read the first 50 pages of Allen Carr and some of it was useful and some of it was stupid so I don't know if I somehow figured out how to quit the way he did and not think of it has giving up a pleasure but rather escaping. Also, is there anything I can do about this fucking chest congestion? I'm fucking dying over here.

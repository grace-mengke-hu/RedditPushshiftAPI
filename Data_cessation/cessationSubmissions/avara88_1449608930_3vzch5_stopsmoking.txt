44 Days

Well, I'm at 44 days now. I'm pretty sure I wouldn't have made it this far if not for this sub and the advice I've found here. It's funny, 6 weeks is not really a very long time, but it FEELS like I quit smoking ages ago, almost like a distant memory. I see people smoking and most of the time I'm like "Wow I can't believe I used to do that."

One of the reasons I'm posting today is that I suddenly remembered when I was leading up to quitting, and during my first few days, seeing people post with 30+ days seemed like a really really long time. Now it seems like it went by in a flash. I know that sounds contradictory to what I said about it feeling like forever since I smoked. Even though it feels like smoking is something I did a long time ago, the time has also flown by (at least after the first 2 weeks or so). Those first 2 weeks crept by, but time did get back to normal eventually.

I guess my point is, just stop smoking. You can do it. Get through those first few days, then those first couple weeks, and before you know it you'll be nearing 50 days, then 100, etc.

5 days have passed: a look to the future

Now that I feel I am getting past this bad habit of smoking, I am thinking of what I can do next. I want to develop myself as a person and live quite a different lifestyle (with a lot of new habits, but also many things from the past that worked but somehow got lost):

* Reflect/journal every day to understand myself. I have a mentor now and he asked me some great questions - I see that I took care of other people's needs a lot but have trouble giving mine priority. That was also one of the causes why my girlfriend broke up with me a few weeks ago (I have hope that we may get back together).
* Pick up learning languages again, starting with Spanish and German.
* Make a beautiful garden. It's raining today, so I can start digging again (it's heavy clay soil)
* Do a triathlon in a month (training every day, with a break here and there. It's a great feeling to improve my health in this way)
* Organize a rock climbing weekend every month. The first one is in 3 weeks. There's about 20 people who want to come.
* Reorganize and beautify my home. Make it a place where I'd LOVE to be. I have been focussing on work for so long, I want to start living, and having a good place of my own is a good basis for that.
* Create routines. Have breakfast in the morning, and a morning routine (making bed, a bit of reading, meditate). Start cooking in the evening again. Things like this.

These are just some of the things. I will take my time to make this transformation. Doing it step-by-step, but I am glad that I am already making the first one, and perhaps the biggest: quitting smoking!

I think that if I continue this positive change, that the chance of starting smoking again is very small. Not only that, I believe my life (which I already enjoy) will be so much better, I can't imagine what is possible.

All the best everyone!

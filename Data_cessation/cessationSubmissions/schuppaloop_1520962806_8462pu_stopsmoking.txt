You can do it!

I just saw a post from /r/Serendipity and realized I needed to update you guys.

I have tried to quit many times, but it has finally stuck. The last time I used nicotine (in a spliff and cigarette) was December 31, 2016. It's been well over a year.

I feel better, can run faster and farther without getting out of breath, and can taste food better.

What's even better, I don't like the smell of cigarette smoke anymore!

You can do it - just keep trying.

The celebratory cigar

Curious how you all would approach this?  I've had a few occasions where cigars were smoked in celebration of particular events.  But being a smoker at the time, I never thought twice.  As a recent quitter, it isn't so simple.

I'm inclined to treat it like an alcoholic during a toast.  How do you handle the social aspect of it?  Is it generally acceptable to say that you quit smoking and a cigar is not appropriate for you?

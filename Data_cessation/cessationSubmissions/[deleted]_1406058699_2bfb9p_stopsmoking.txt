Starting the journey

I'm counting today as my quit day since it's been more of a gradual progression. I've been trying to quit for a few months now. Started taking Wellbutrin as it's supposed to help and I've been battling depression for quite some time. It did help for a while (on both accounts) until I started getting angry for no reason. It just turned me in to a different person and I didn't like that person, so I quit taking it (gradually as one is supposed to). 

After that I kind of gave up for a bit, but got back on the wagon a couple weeks ago. I started using a e cigarette and that really did help. Today I'm e cig free, but am using a nicotine patch. And today has been a good day. I went on a walk for my lunch break. I've also been occupying my time with My Fitness Pal and Plant Nanny. I've eaten quite a few tic tacs and drank a crap ton of water. But I haven't had one cigarette. Or even really had the urge. 

I'm sure it will get more difficult; but I think if I can continue to find ways to occupy my time and my thoughts I'll be just fine.

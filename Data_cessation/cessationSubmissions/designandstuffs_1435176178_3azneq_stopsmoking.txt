annnd.... again.

I've posted a couple times in the past week. My first post was about struggling with anxiety and how that has made it really hard for me to quit. Here's the thing: i've come to the conclusion that NOW is the time. NOW is always the time. It will never ever be easier than right now. The longer I prolong it, the harder it will be. Today is the first day and I feel like I I'm on the verge of having a nervous breakdown. I just keep telling myself I don't need it, I dont WANT it and that I am going to be so much happier in the end. ugh. here we go. i can do this. I AM doing it. I'm already free.

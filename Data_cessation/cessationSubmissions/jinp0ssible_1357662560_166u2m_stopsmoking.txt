365 days clean.

Last New Years, I set myself the resolution to live a healthier lifestyle.  Thus, after 9 years of smoking cigarettes, I decided to call it quits. Although I was tempted several times whilst out socializing, I never caved in, and because of that I am so proud of myself.

Thought I would share my story with /r/stopsmoking.  

365 days clean.  Cold turkey.  We can do it!

Just hit 4 weeks and the cravings are almost gone...

Last year I signed up for the Great North Run (September half marathon) and used this as my inspiration to quit. I quit at the end of February 2012 and started training a lot.

It went great and I felt fantastic and this resulted in a completed time of 1h: 34m: 59s which I was delighted with.

Unfortunately, once finished and with no new running goals to aim for I ended up taking a break from running and finally I started smoking again in October.

I have now done 4 weeks of not smoking following my decision to take up running again, which seems to be my ultimate way of giving up.

Just this weekend I went for a night out on the beer and I was really proud of myself for staying strong when the temptation was all around me.

I have been using nicotine patches (as I always do when quitting) to help me through and today I have decided to do without and I am feeling fantastic and so determined again.

I just thought I'd share my story and say a big **well done** to everyone who is quitting. **Keep it up!**

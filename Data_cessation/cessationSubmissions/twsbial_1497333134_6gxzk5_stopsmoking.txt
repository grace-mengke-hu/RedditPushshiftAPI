Quitting the second time.

With the helped from this subreddit, I managed to quit before and made it two years smoke free. Until one day I made the biggest mistake that one stick wouldn't hurt (I know I am an idiot), the following day I am back to one pack a day. For two years now I am a nicotine slave. My question is how do I find again the motivation to stop smoking? Is it really harder the second time?

Bad cough 3 months in

So I quit last June 1, and while the wooziness and mood swings were hell (thankfully over those now), I never got sick; only started to get this bad dry cough around early September. Not sure if itâ€™s connected to stopping smoking. It feels like my lungs are trying to expel a chunk of rock at times. Have any of you gone through this? Anything you did, meds you took?

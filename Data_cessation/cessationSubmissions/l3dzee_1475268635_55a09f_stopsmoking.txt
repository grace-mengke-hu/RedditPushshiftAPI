Day 200 tip

It is my day 200 since I quit smoking. I have not smoked 1400 cigs and saved $780. That definitely puts things in perspective.

One of my trick to achieve this was to write 10 reasons why i want to quit and create a weekly reminder for the list. So every monday i read it without fail and went strong for a week. Also i have come so far in my quit that sometimes I forget the original reasons why i quit smoking. Reading the list makes me all motivated again!!!

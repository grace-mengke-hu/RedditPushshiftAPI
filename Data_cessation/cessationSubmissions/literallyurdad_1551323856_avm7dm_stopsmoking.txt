I want to quit

I have been vaping for about a year, (not smoking, but still nic and still bad) and I want to quit this. I've known it's bad but I never cared, not until I burnt a coil minutes after putting it in did I realize I had a problem.

With that realization, I want to quit this and get better, but I don't know how to. So that's where you guys come in. Where do I start? How do I get past cravings and withdrawal? How do I get better?

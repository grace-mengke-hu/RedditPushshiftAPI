Just saying hi. On day 5! Mixed emotions going on.

Quit for 5 years and a few years ago started back up thinking I could get by with a couple a day.  Didn’t NEED to start back up, but did.  My husband smoked and I enjoyed spending time with him, chatting and smoking.  He was sad that I started back up but really couldn’t argue with me since he was a smoker. 

Now he has quit smoking as of 10/30 due to having major oral surgery.  His problems were caused by smoking.  I’ve quit with him in solidarity.  I never smoked as much as he did (never smoked during the workday for example, just in the evenings and on weekends), and I’m never smoking again.

I’ve learned that I can’t just have one or two here and there,  Cigarettes are completely off limits to me.  I feel kind of relieved that I don’t have to smoke anymore.  I feel very relieved that my chest pains and headaches have subsided.  I hope my husband can stick with it. We’re both 5 days in and he’s pretty grumpy.

We’ve gotten rid of all smoking paraphernalia.  

I guess I’m posting here because I woke up this first Saturday since quitting wanting to make my coffee, go outside, and chat/drink coffee/smoke with my husband.  I’ll miss that.  Especially because he’s not feeling well I guess.  So I’m missing the whole package right now.  How can I feel relieved not to smoke but miss it at the same time?  My body’s nicotine free now.  I don’t remember feeling this way the first time I quit cold turkey.  It’s almost like I’m mourning the passing of an era or something.  It’s weird.

20 years a slave...and now I'm free for 50 days.

I've been smoking for 20 years, and before I quit I was pretty much a 30 a day man.  I've been a non smoker for 50 days.  Sometimes, it is still a struggle but nowhere near as bad as it was in the first week.  But it gets better,  And the benefits for which I've previously expressed as [regaining my superhuman abilities](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/37tt3j/since_i_quit_i_have_regained_my_long_lost/) are inspirational for me to keep going.  To anyone on a similar level of addiction, I've this (rather long) piece to say.

I have tried to quit every half a year for 20 years.  I failed every time.   The biggest, hugest, most gigantic difference to my quit this time round, that makes this **the** most successful and **the** most confident quit, are these **ground rules** I set my self.   I learned a lot of these from 'why quit.com' and Allen Carr's Easyway book and most of this stuff from r/stopsmoking.   Thank you to all stopsmoking subredditors for your input and feedback.

**Cold Turkey!**   I just see no way around it.  To supply myself with nicotine in any way, shape or form is just prolonging my addiction.  I have to realise that I am an addict and I **have** to break free from my addiction and I have to prepare to suffer for a short time.  No "1 a day" for being a good boy, no NRT, no vapes, no substitutes, no patches.  Just ...nothing.  It's tough, it's really hard, but I knew what to expect.  After trying to quit so many times I kind of knew this was a hurdle to get over.  I just accept that I'm going to suffer for 3 to 4 maybe 5 or 6 days while my physical dependency lessens.  I therefore prepared my first few days by a) avoiding social events, b) minimise stressful situations (i.e. set the weekend as my quit period, not the start of a working week), c) prepare loads of snack foods  d) embrace the pangs as a good thing that is happening to me.  Guess what happened?  I got through that.  I'm just about 50 days into my quit and growing ever strong.  The first week is the toughest part.  Once my physical dependency is over, the next challenge is to overcome and beat the sneaky mind games that the little nicotine monster within me plays.  There are many mind tricks that i won't go into but many a subredditor here can testify to.

**No Drinking**, well for at least for a month, anyway, at least to a point where I'm confident with myself to reject the temptation of cigarettes.  Alcohol is a great inhibitor of good judgment and number one supporter of bad judgement calls.  It would just weaken my resolve.  This would be difficult for alcoholics.  As a heavy drinker myself and probably a borderline alcoholic, this is tough, really tough.  So effectively, I quit both drinking and cigarettes to help me with my smoke quit.   At this point in time, I now enjoy a drink again, even more than before as I can actually taste what I'm drinking.  A 12 year single malt scotch tastes divine!  On a positive note, I don't drink anywhere near as much as I used to and secondly, I'm confident with my resolve that I won't take a puff while I'm drunk or tipsy.

**Be in the right mental state** - this basically means, know what to expect and be prepared for it.  There are many things to expect and just by being prepared to deal with it, I am already strong.  I also call this putting myself in a zen state or making myself accept what is happening to me physically, mentally, spiritually, whatever.  My body was never meant to be dependent to nicotine and it actually doesn't have to be.  It's just my nicotine addicted mind playing tricks with me.  All those neuro-pathways in my brain were built up out of strong associations and triggers of smoking and just have to be bypassed.  I was a "never smoker" before I was 16 and there is no reason why I can't be one after 20 years.  Only I, only me, could find the resolve within, to observe myself from within, and fight the inner demon and ignore the cravings and ignore the temptations and accept this one simple truth..... **There is absolutely no, not one single advantage and not one reason to smoke.  Never take another puff...ever!!**   

Finding this zen state is unique to each individual but I believe that state of mind is attainable by anyone.  I just had to find it.

As my non-smoking days started to build up, I also learn a lot more about myself, my addicted self and how I can deal with life without being chained to an addiction.  Even after 50 days there are still mental stumbling blocks and temptations.  But I just remind myself, never take another puff.  

There is so much I'd like to talk about and explain and inform all of you, about my experience but then I would have to write a book.  Allen Carr (and other's) has already done that, so read what he has to say.  It really is gospel.

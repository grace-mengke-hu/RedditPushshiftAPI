Day 27 - Not One Puff

Well day 27 is here and this battle is getting much easier but I can't let my guard down. I had a couple very stressful situations over the last week that tested my will power and I won. I've told everyone I know that I will never smoke a cigarette again not even one puff so I have the support. I congratulate myself everyday so I'm proud, this gets me through tough moments. 
What was difficult for me was at a party a lady took a pack of smokes from her purse and they were the brand I smoked then she took one out and to see that cigarette " not lit" was extremely enticing. I got through the moment, yes I could have asked for one but why...I'm a non-smoker.
I watch people smoking now and can't believe I was one of them for 30 years just standing around inhaling and exhaling smoke...why it's so stupid. Sure it was cool when I started (not sure why) but now it's a pain in the ass and crazy expensive.
Ive been saving the money I used to spend on cigarettes in a glass jar and it's nice to see it building.... I'll have a new guitar in about a month from now.
EVERYONE... We can do this together and I would be happy to not smoke with you today!

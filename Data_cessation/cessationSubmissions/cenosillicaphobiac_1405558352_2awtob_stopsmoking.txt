Smokers in the park

It's my wife's birthday, and she wanted to celebrate with a picnic in the local park.  As we were packed up and heading back to the car, we passed a couple that was lounging under a tree smoking.  Now I see smokers here and there, but this one really hit home because not so long ago I would have been one of them, ruining a perfectly good moment in the fresh air, on the green grass, under the sun, by puffing away at several cigarettes.

Even with the difficulty of stopping Chantix and being home alone with my son all day, that moment didn't raise an urge in me at all, in fact, it was quite the opposite.

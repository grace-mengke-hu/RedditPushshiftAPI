Quitting in a house where people smoke inside :/

I have been smoking for a few years now, but never had to deal with other roommates that smoke inside. I know the obvious will be to have them smoke outside but I live in Northern Minnesota and it's not really an option (some days the high is -15f) Just wondering if anyone else has had to go through this? I should say I believe it is agreed upon amongst the roommates to smoke outside once the weather is nicer. Also, I am a dipper as well any smokers have tips on quitting the dip?

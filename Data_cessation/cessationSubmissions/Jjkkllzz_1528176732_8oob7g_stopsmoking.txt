Panic attack

I was extremely anxious my whole drive to work, had to leave work early because I felt a meltdown imminent (I am also congested so I think they just thought a cold), and had a panic attack on the way home. I am five days no cigarettes but only on my second day no nicotine so it is probably partly attributed to nicotine leaving the body. I didn’t smoke. I kept telling myself that cigarettes make anxiety worse. This is true but also true that is one cigarette could possibly have stopped that one attack (even though its also probably to blame for it). It’s all over now and still not smoking, but I know sometimes with bad panic attacks I can get to where I’d do almost anything to make them stop, so I am just hoping I can not have one until I’m fit to handle or somehow I can get through it like I did this one. Maybe one day they’ll go away entirely.

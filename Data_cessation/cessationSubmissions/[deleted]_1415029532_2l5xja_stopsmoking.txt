These withdrawals suck but it is totally worth it.

I "quit" smoking about a month ago. Most of my friends quit before I did which has made it easier. I've gone from a 2 pack a day smoker to bumming about 3-7 a day from various friends who still smoke. I've got an e-cig, but it doesn't really seem to be doing much for me. I guess I'm just looking for some advice on how some of you were able to finally say no to friends who offer you a smoke, even though they know you are trying to quit. I've asked some of them not to bum to me, but I get the same old "Your an adult, you don't have to take it." I'm open to any and all advice, as I want to be done with this now.

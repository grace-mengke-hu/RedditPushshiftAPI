Last night someone complimented my physique!

I am officially now 21 days into my cold turkey quit from cigarettes/nicotine and it is so worth it! Now even people around me are noticing changes, and it's very uplifting. I was hanging with some friends last night and a couple of them pointed out that my skin looked much healthier and that I also looked like I gained more muscle even though I haven't started working out yet! It definitely made me feel very good about my decision to quit! 

Just wanted to share my excitement, and I hope it helps others continue their journey into quitting, because other people will notice your improvement as well!

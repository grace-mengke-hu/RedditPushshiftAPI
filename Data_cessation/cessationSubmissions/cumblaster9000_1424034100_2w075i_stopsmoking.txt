Any advice or perspectives on "cutting back"?

So, i'll quit and then have to reset my badge. I've been having to do this a few times, but i've noticed the extended brakes from smoking has really lowered my tolerance and cravings. People talk smack about weaning off instead of cold turkey, but that's how my parents quit apparently, and i've never seen them smoke a cigarette in my life... So, is it such a bad method?

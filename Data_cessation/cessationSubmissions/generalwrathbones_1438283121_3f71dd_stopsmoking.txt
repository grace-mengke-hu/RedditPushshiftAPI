3 Weeks Today! (Did not quit job yet, for those who remember...)

I bought myself all kinds of treats, a bottle of whiskey which I drank part of and a kayak paddle and facemask and waterproof flashlight and a delivery pizza. 

I still am dipping a small amount but this is the longest I've gone smoke free in about fifteen years. Been smoking since early teens...twenty plus years. It hurts on all kinds of levels to not smoke but the balance has been tipped, it would hurt on more levels to smoke!

EDIT This is my last can for a long while too, have a huge box of nicotine gum to start tomorrow

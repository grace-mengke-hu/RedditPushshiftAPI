Warning about nicotine patches.

I ordered the patches according to how they say to do the program. Step one - 21mg, step two - 14mg, step 3 - 7mg. Since I smoked over 10 cigarettes a day, I started with step one.

They have absolutely helped my cravings for cigarettes, but today (Day 4) I had a nicotine overdose. Only had one of those after chain smoking all day (while under the influence). I forgot how fucking awful it feels.

So, took the patch off today and I'm going to skip to step 2 instead. I did drop down to ultra lights before quitting, so I should have looked into the patches a little more before doing step 1.

On a more positive note; reminded me how instantly harmful nicotine can be to your body. Smoking a cigarette is the last thing I want to do after being reminded about how awful it can make you feel.

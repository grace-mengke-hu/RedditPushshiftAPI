Day 5... my experience and advice

So I am someone who absolutely loves smoking. I read allan car's book and agreed on some points and yet disagreed with others... One of the truest things he says and makes sence... smokjng does absolutely nothing for you. I use to be a chain smoker. I smoked 2 packs a day minimum... sometime 3. I have tried to quit around 5 times. But this time my reason was completely diffrent. I do not want to be controlled anymore. So from 60 sigs a day... to zero. I am now in day 5 and I still get extic cravings. I really hope it goes away soon. I won't ever give in though...I am done smoking. For everyone on day 1,2 and 3... just stick it out. Day 4 and 5 is better.

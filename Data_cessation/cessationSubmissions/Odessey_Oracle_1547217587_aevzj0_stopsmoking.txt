Vaping as a way of slowly phasing out nicotine intake

Hey everyone! 

I've been trying to give up smoking for the past couple of years, but I'm not the most persistent person and I've relapsed dozens of times. I have been smoking for a shorter time than most of you, I think (about 5 years), so as a layman, I would assume it'd be easier to quit than for most smoking veterans who have a decades-long smoking addiction. Due to having relapsed so often, however, I feel like I need a little extra something to transition to a non-smoker. A couple of my friends have managed to quit over the past couple months by switching to vaping. After several months of decreasing the amount of nicotine in their vaping 'fluids' (not sure how to call this), they switched to 'fluids' without any nicotine - they're pretty much non-smokers now. I don't really wanna enter the vape nation as an enthusiast, but if it'll help me quit smoking, I'm in.

I know very little about vaping in scientific terms, but I recall it being way less harmful than smoking cigarettes, so I wanna give it a shot. What are your experiences in using vaping as some kind of support bar for quitting? What are some of the downsides of vaping? Are there any reasons why I should reconsider buying a vape? Thanks!

Went for a run today

Every day has been getting easier, although there are still some key points/triggers in the day that are tough. 

I can't believe how much energy I have-- and now i have the time to do everything!

Got caught in the rain last night with my SO, and we ran home. I was barely even winded. This morning I strapped on my very neglected running shoes and went for my first run in 2 years. It went better today than it ever did 2 years ago when I was running several times a week, but still smoking 1/2 pack a day. 

Cheers to being smoke free!

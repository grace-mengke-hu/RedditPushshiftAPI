Really struggling today!

Hello again! 

Been on this sub since I quit 13 days ago and it's not been too bad up until now.  The last couple of days have been a complete nightmare. I've had a proper shit week at work and i'm starting to feel some right pressure. All I can think about is having a smoke and the craving are brutal at the minute. Either the time distortion is wigging me out a little bit or I'm just having loads of them.

I know I need to stay strong though. Really can't fall back into that trap again so if you have any words of encouragement, giz em ere!

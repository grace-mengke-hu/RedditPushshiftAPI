I already forgot that I was a smoker!

Hi guys, I just wanted to update that I have already forgotten that I was an ex smoker of 25 years. I was a pack every other day, until the last year, when I started smoking almost a pack a day. Since I quit:

- I have saved over $800 so I bought a new video card lol. 
- I've been able to keep up with the guys at the gym at basketball.
- I can now kiss and hug my wife without smelling like an ashtray.
- Everything feels cleaner. My car and my clothes don't stink anymore. 
- I don't have to stand outside in the cold or rain to smoke only to come back inside to stink up my office. 
- No more bad breath. 
- My garage doesn't stink anymore and no more cigarette butts outside the house. 
- Food tastes better.
- With the 20 minutes I gained every day, I now have time to study part-time, and take on extra hobbies.
- My mood has been generally happier than when I was a smoker because I no longer feel guilt with each cigarette.

I feel like I was reborn seriously! 

How I quit: I used a no-name brand 3-stage nicotine patch system which cost the same as 6 packs of cigarettes in total! My advice to all is to not make a "big deal" out of it. Distract yourself. What I mean by this is to stop thinking about smoking, smoking forums, smoking magazines, etc. and think about something else just to get your mind off of it. Distract yourself with something not smoking related. When you crave, look at the clock for 3 minutes and think that if you get past this craving, the next one will be even easier. I am SOOOO happy I quit. You can do it too!

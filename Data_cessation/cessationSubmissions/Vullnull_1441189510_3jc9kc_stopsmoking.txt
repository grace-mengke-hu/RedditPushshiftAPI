Some more help would be great..

Hi everyone! 
I've been lurking around for quite a while, and yesterday I smoked my last cigarette ( that was the idea at least ) 
Since I'm having a lot of trouble, i made an account so that I could receive some tips ... 

This morning started good, I knew to avoid coffee, and I knew that if I wouldn't go outside to company my dog, I could resist smoking. 

But now... 
I work in a chemical plant, so we need to go outside every hour for a 10 minute break, due to the toxic damps and such 

Here is where the troubles began, first break was hard , but I succeeded! Next break, unfortunately I bummed a cig from a coworker. How do you manage to resist at work, especially when I have a break every hour, and where 18 out of 20 people smoke... ?!
And where everyone is sitting outside, together, telling about their week and such. To me it seems way more pleasant if I can chime in on those conversations ( like i always do) while smoking  

This is so hard... Bit still , i felt really guilty about smoking that cig today. 
I have a big jar at home, and a big pack of cigarettes. 
Every evening, before I  go to sleep, i want to crack one cigarette in the jar, and put a note with it. Just as a personal "achievement" or reward... But I already failed today 

I'm also seriously doubting if I can pull this of 
Stupid examples : 

If I play guitar , after a couple hours I smoke , I do it as a reward to myself because I composed something new ( or if I get stressed out) 
Or if you watch tv, and commercials are starting 

This might be stupid and such, but I smoked for ten years now , and I've had astma when I was younger.
So I need to find a way to keep my mind away from smoking , and my willpower failed on my before. Don't want patches, sprays or pills, as many already adviced me that are close to me

Thanks in advance! 
Sorry for bad spelling and mistakes. I'm from Belgium ;-) 

( at least this post kept me busy for 15 minutes, didn't smoke!! )

7 days

While I believe the first days were really hardcore, they seem to me as if they happend years ago. During the weekend I felt my whole body numb and I was easily irritable, luckily I stayed home all week and at work is not expected of me to be sociable. I'm happy my brain is healing, my lungs too and I noticed on the treadmill I can ran faster than ever ( to the point where I thought i'll have a stroke haha). I believe my addiction's root is psychological, relating to having build a strong foundation for myself. Anyway, I read all the posts from this sub and I'm all so thankfull for all of them.

Tomorrow is 2 weeks. No cravings... but withdrawl?

I'm 22 and had my last ever cigarette 2 weeks ago. Any urges I have to smoke are very slight at this point in time which I'm thankful for... but I think/hope I'm experiencing withdrawl symptoms.

It feels like my breathing is shallow. I have irregular, dull pains in my lungs. A few times my hands feel like the circulation is poor in them. From googling about the internet I've seen lots of posts where people are saying that this is normal after you quit and your lungs are healing, and/or that is can be anxiety-related as a withdrawl symptom.

I was wondering if anyone on here had experienced anything similar and could give me some advice. I'm terrified that I've given myself serious issues in my time as a smoker.

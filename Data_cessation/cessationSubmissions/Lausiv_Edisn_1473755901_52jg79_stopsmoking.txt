Quit yesterday

I never really was a heavy smoker, but since high school I smoked on and off, sometimes a pack a day (seldom) or  5cigs/day more regularly .

The good thing, I have no withdrawal when I quit for some time, only in social situation with other smokers I'm often having the craving to join for  a smoke.

But I'm in a certain age now where the risk of smoking rises un-proportionally, so maybe this time I will quit for good.


nonsmoker for 16h now

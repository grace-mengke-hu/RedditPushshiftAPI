I made it a week! *happy dance*

I’ve tried and failed to quit many times over the 15 years I’ve been a smoker, but this time feels different. This time, it feels like something I’m doing to take care of myself instead of something everyone else is telling me to do. 

I’m so proud of myself, and I’m already feeling the difference in my breathing and my tastebuds. :)

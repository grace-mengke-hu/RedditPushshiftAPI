Server problems.

My birthday was last week today (woohoo!), and I decided to make the commitment to quitting this time for real.  So far, I'm at six days cold turkey.  I was a smoker on and off since I was 16; mostly just an occasional social smoker, but at times, a serious chainsmoker.  This summer was particularly bad, and I was smoking a pack every two days.  An embarrassing admission.

I was unemployed this summer, so I think boredom and warm weather outside made the habit much more appealing.  However, now that I'm working again as a server, the cravings are pretty bad too.  I worked 13 hours last night, and you don't even get a break unless you smoke.  I found myself going to the bathroom once every hour or so just to sit down.  Does anyone have tips to deal with this?  Working in a professional environment where everyone smokes, and smoking is actually rewarded (with breaks)?  I was really good last night, suppressing the cravings and drinking water, but it also wasn't that busy.  I'm worried that a busier, and more stressful night might make the cravings harder to resist.  Any tips would help a lot.

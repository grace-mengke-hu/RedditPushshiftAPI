Hot flashes??? ugh lol

I don't remember getting these when I first quit but I went down to step 3 on the patches about 10 days ago, and I've been getting hot flashes. They're pretty annoying to be honest. I googled it - yup, nicotine withdrawal. I was getting worried for a sec that by quitting smoking I might have inadvertently transitioned myself into a menopausal woman (not that there's anything wrong with that!). Like all nicotine withdrawal symptoms, I'm sure this too will pass!

I can see how using NRT really does prolong the agony; it would have been nice to have gotten all this crap out of the way at once. But, for me at least, it was the only way; apparently I need a slow drip of agony haha :)

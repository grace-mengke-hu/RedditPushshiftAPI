Any other sailors here? The smoking culture on ships is horrible.

I'm not sure if this is universal or not, but on ships where I've been on, the smoking culture is really out of hands. Basically if you quit you are alone. And trust me it's hard to be alone in 12 square m cabin half of your life.

Sure you can do other stuff like hit the gym and whatnot... But still alone. Everybody else hanging in the smoker, having a beer and a good time. 

Anyway, i'm gonna make it. But damn is it hard in here.

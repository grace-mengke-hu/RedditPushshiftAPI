7 days now. This shit sucks.

Honestly, I don't even know why the hell I quit, except that I had a really brutal cold last Monday, and by Wednesday I hadn't had a cigarette, and after that I was apparently just curious about how much suffering to which I could subject myself. (Yes, this might be a bit dramatic, but who isn't dramatic when they're quitting?

I carry a half-full pack of cigarettes and a lighter. I figure that every time I have a craving, I have to make an immediate, conscious decision not to smoke. I can't do this thing where I fool myself or distract myself- I just have to confront the suffering of not smoking head-on. It sounds weird, but when you're having a hardcore craving, it's way too easy to autopilot to the store and buy a pack; with the pack I have, I can avoid smoking because having it is an immediate and obvious temptation. I can guard against the temptation of smoking if I know where it's coming from.

God, but it sucks royally. I'm putting up with a craving right now, and it's just... Mentally exhausting to fight off. I remember trying to quit back in college; I made it four days, and then finally had a smoke on my patio. I was sitting on this wicker chaise lounge, and I distinctly remember lighting my cigarette, taking a deep inhale, and all the stress just *dissolved*. Everything was okay again. Man, this *sucks*, and quitting is self-torture, and I can't figure out why I'm doing this to myself. I suppose it's because that which doesn't kill you makes you stronger.

Anyways, there's ny drunken ramble.

Day 5 HOLY CRAP WHAT IS GOING ON?

I quit cold turkey Sunday night after 10 years of Newport 100s.  I've pretty much been a terror, as has my husband, who also quit.  Our house is unfriendly to say the least.  So I've got all the regular things, irritability, headache, etc.  BUT WHY AM I GETTING ACNE, WHAT IS THIS?  GIANT, STUPID zits all over my chin!  

I feel like I've done such a stellar job dealing with this and not giving in, I've noticed my other symptoms getting gradually better, and now I'm smacked with this!  I thought my skin would look BETTER after quitting!

How long is this going to last?

Day 3 and struggling

So it's been 3 days since I quit. I was home enjoying some time off and I decided to take the leap.

Now that I'm at work though, I'm really struggling. I'm very aware of each time that I would have taken a smoke break and I'm not doing it.

Decided to spend some time on this sub to motivate myself. Wish me luck!

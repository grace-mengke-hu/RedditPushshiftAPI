Nicotine withdrawals?

Been a pack-a-day smoker for 15-20 years. 
Used Snus for 5 years. So yeah, I had my fair share of nicotine use through the years.
Stopped smoking cold turkey 3 months ago. Stopped using snus cold turkey 4 weeks ago. Used a nicotine patch for 2 weeks and then I stopped that too.
Everything felt great up until a few days ago when I sort of had a small panic attack because I felt heart palpitations.
I freaked out and headed to the ER one night and then a doctor's appointment the next day.
Bloodwork was done and a ECG - and everything was completely normal.

I didn't make the connection then as I was so anxious about my health but these past few days I've been thinking if it's all because of nicotine abstinence..
Anyone else had similar experiences? Why didn't I feel anxious, heart palpitations and general restlessness the first days? Is it possible that withdrawals began a few weeks after I stopped using nicotine?

How long will this shit last? Can I help myself somehow? Vitamins or something to help me get over this sooner?

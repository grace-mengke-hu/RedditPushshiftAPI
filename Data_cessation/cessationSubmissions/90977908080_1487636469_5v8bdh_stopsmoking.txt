maybe i've finally decided that i want to live

this is my fourth time quitting, decided last night i won't smoke another cigarette ever again. 

first time i was smoke-free for 6 months, then relapsed and smoked once, twice in a week before starting to smoke a pack a day couple of months later. later i tried again, started smoking again after 10 days, last fall i was without smoking for a month.

maybe i can finally do it now. i'm tired. i'm 5'3 ft 99 lb female, i'm honestly surprised i haven't killed myself yet with my drinking and drug use. haven't done any drugs in couple of months now. i'm thinking if i should quit drinking too, once i was without drinking for 4 months and my head had never felt so clear. 

i haven't really given a shit about my health because i hate life but now i feel like i actually might want to live. i don't want to waste myself with a useless stupid death.

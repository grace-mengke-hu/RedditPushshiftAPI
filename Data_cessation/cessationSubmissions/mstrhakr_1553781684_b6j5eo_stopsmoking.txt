Finally did it!

I've been following this subreddit for a long time, looking at all the success you've all had and wishing I could figure out how to achieve the same success. Eventually I decided to just go for it, while it was hard at first, after being a non smoker for almost two weeks it has gotten much easier.  In the past I've been quit for almost 6 months before 1 cigarette and a bad decision to smoke it had me back at a pack a day after just a week. I'm sure I'm going to be successful this time, I have no more doubts about my success anymore because I have no doubts about wanting to be a non smoker. Sorry for the wall of text, I'm just really excited to finally be free!

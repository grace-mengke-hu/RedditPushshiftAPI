I can't help but worry I've done permanent damage to my lungs.

I quit about 6 weeks ago with the help of Allen Carr's Stop Smoking and I have felt a lot better mentally at least. I was part heavy smoker, part casual smoker meaning that when I had a pack, I would chain smoke through the entire thing otherwise I would just buy two for a dollar off of friends, coworkers, strangers, etc. Anyways, I feel like my lungs are damaged. They still feel heavy and I still have a shortness of breath that doesn't seem to be getting any better. I would have thought by now they would feel much better but maybe I'm just being impatient.

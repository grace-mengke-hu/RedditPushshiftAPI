here i am again....

it's like they say, never quit quitting. i will never quit quitting. i am hopeful, strong and am sick of how addicted i am to this shit. if someone was to come up and demand 10 dollars from me a day, and to stand out in -20 weather with freezing cold winds (canadian here, north east) cause they said do, i'd say "fuck off, are you nuts?" but here i am, doing that for cigarettes. it's ridiculous and pisses me off. i am angry, and i want it all to end.

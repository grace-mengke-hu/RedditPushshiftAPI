Need advice for the week 3-4 mark

I am on day 18 of my smokefree life and most of the things are going as planned. However i think there is a critical issue with my mental state about smoking.

I started to get the feeling of "emptiness" and a very subtle depressive mood (dissatisfaction about life etc.). I guess every ex-smoker can relate to these feelings. I guess i am experiencing the thing called "extinction burst".

I failed and relapsed on my last 3-4 attempts around the week 3-4 mark. The problem was the same, feel the emptiness, get disoriented and smoke to run from it.

I am really afraid to fall into the nicotine trap once again. Last year war a constant quit-relapse cycle and it was not pleasant as you can guess. 

I am looking for any advice, thought that can help me. Thanks and take care.

Just posting this here for some accountability.

I've dreamed of quitting smoking for awhile now and now I'm going to actually try. I've told my girlfriend I've tried then a day or two later I show up with a new pack with some lame ass excuse like I bought it out of habit and I might as well since I have it now. I'm done giving big tobacco thousands of dollars a year. Even in my financial state I somehow would find a way to get them. I'm putting my foot down, not anymore.

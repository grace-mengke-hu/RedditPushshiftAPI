A poll of people who have been successful for a period of time

Apologies if this has been done. So I am currently on day three - it’s vaping rather than smoking that I am quitting, quite a hefty nicotine withdrawal. It’s not going too badly at the moment, mornings are tough but then it’s easier. Currently I am using 12.5mg patches. I can’t help thinking that I’m again just swapping one nicotine substitute for another. I am fearful I think, of upsetting my mental health as this is sometimes a little fragile! 

My question is what sort of percentage of people have successfully just quit cold turkey? Is that the most successful method long term or have people found substitutes help? 

Keep up the good fight people!

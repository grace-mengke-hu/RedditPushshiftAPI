Pain in lungs/chest when sleeping/eating?

Hey everyone,  

My boyfriend stopped smoking 3 months ago, after gradually decreasing his smoking frequency since september. About a month ago, he started getting pains in his upper back/lungs and it hurts whenever he swallows his food, unless it's a very tiny little bite; and also when he lies down for a long time. He thinks it's related to him stopping smoking (some cleansing?), and so I'm asking you ex-smokers if you've also experienced this and it's normal or if we should just go to the doctor?  
(boyfriend is very stubborn about doctor visits...)  
Thanks!

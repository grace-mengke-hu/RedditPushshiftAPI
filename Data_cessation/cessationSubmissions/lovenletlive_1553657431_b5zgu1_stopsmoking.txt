54 Days Cigarette-Free... purchased a vape today. Need Advice.

Hey guys/gals. I've had the usual back and forth with quitting cigarettes, and finally got it down. It's been absolutely great, and I cant say I ever want to go back. Today, after completely losing myself to an urge, not even sure it was smoke-related. Maybe it was fatigue? Not sure. 
I spent $200 on a vape with nicotine juice. I know I should drive to the gas station and throw this set up in the garbage. And I will.
Should I feel this terrible about this, or just view it as a learning experience?

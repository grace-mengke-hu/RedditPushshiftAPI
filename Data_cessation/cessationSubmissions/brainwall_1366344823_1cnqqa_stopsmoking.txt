Quitters, how many days did it take for you to really start feeling normal again?

I messed up today. :( I feel like it will help me to know what the average time frame for feeling like crap will be. I'm sure it varies with how long/much you've been smoking, but I am curious anyway. I have been smoking for three years. During the past two summers (physical labor job around a lot of smokers) I was at a pack a day, but normally I go through 2-3 packs a week. Thanks for all your help! You guys are the best quitters I have ever encountered. :)

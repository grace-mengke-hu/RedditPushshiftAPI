New guy. Again.

So I've failed.  Over and over and over.  Half-assed attempt after half-assed attempt.  I'm going to do this, because I want to do this.  I know it's going to suck.  Badly. 

 After 15 hrs of no nicotine, I sat down at 5:45 in the morning to meditate, as I do daily.  My breath was full.  My body was at ease.  When I got up, I went into a partial panic attack.  

But I am going to do this.  Any cool, motivating replies are surely welcome.  Because I will need it.

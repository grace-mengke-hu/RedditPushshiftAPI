Smoking Vs E-Liquids

The key ingredient in e-liquids, propylene glycol, produces a vapor when heated. This vapor does not irritate the eyes, nor does it contain the harmful substances that smoke does. According to the U.S. FDA, propylene glycol is considered safe, and is not known to cause acute or chronic health issues.
I have found that electronic cigarettes have been a great help quitting smoking altogether,what’s more, vapour from e-liquids does not contain carbon monoxide, so it doesn't deplete oxygen levels in the blood. Vapour won’t harm your skin or cause wrinkles. Propylene glycol is present in most processed foods and does not harm mouth tissues. Crucially, e-liquids have no known effect on the immune system.
The better things that will start you on the road to stop smoking!

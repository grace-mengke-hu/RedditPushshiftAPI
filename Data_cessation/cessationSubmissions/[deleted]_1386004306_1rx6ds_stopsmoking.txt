319 Days gone because life got dark.

I personally have no regrets on buying a pack this time. I have been slipping in and out of a nasty depression these last couple months and right now they were just what I needed to hold me off until I get some important stuff worked out.

I am going to finish this pack and be done with it. Until then, I will reset my badge to 0 because I gave into the urge. I think the problem is that I related cigs to hitting rock bottom, and right now they are the only thing that is keeping me going.

I could throw out the pack right now, but... I need to dull my senses a little longer. I am shitty mood right now and need a crutch to carry me through because no one else will or can.

Even though it is an illusion of happiness, I will take it. Then I will have to come back to the reality of the situation.

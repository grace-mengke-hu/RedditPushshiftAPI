First time posting here...

Here in South Dakota we have something called the "SD Quitline" where users can call to get assistance in quitting smoking. I've been wanting to quit for some time, and have tried a few times with failed attempts.

Through the Quitline, we are able to get eight free weeks of Chantix. I've been on it before, and it worked wonders, although the side effects were less than desirable. I follow this subreddit, as well as the SD Quitline on Facebook. I do that as a reminder to myself that I should quit. Yesterday, I had a smoke, opened up my phone and the Quitline was the first thing on my News Feed. Without thinking, I picked up the phone and called.

So... here we go I guess. I don't know why I'm posting here. Accountability maybe? Advice? Motivation? I'm not exactly sure. I suppose I just wanted someone to know.

Smoking my last cigarette in a couple hours after setting time and date for it - getting excited that the time has come!

Been smoking just short of ten years now and just turned thirty a couple of months ago. I'll be back to pick up my flair after 12:11 EST, can't wait to participate in this community I've been stalking for so long.

Cheers!

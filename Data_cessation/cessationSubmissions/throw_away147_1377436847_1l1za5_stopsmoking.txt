7 days smoke free!

I just want to thank everyone here for the kind words and encouragement to help get me through this VERY long week.

I was a 5-8 packs per week smoker for 5 years, but I've been smoking regularly since 2002. My last cigarette was 6:00am last Sunday. I've been carrying a half pack if my favorite blends in my pocket since day 2. Having them readily available has given me a sort of "peace of mind" when a craving hits. It like I can tell my subconscious "chill out dude! They're right here."  Then every craving I kill was because I chose not to smoke, not because I didn't have any and COULD NOT smoke.

Also, I've refused to stop hanging out with my smoker friends. I wanted to face my biggest triggers head on as soon as possible. The thoughts were that the longer I allow the triggers to run free, the longer they will really be triggers. I needed to conquer them as soon as I could. Blow-pops (the suckers with gum inside) helped me tremendously with this effort. They kept my smoking hand busy, I got to chew on the gum after the candy was gone, and I still had the stick to chew on if I got bored when the bad gum lost its flavor lol

Again, thanks /r/stopsmoking

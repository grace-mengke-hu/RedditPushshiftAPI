Putting some things in context

I had smoked on and off for about the last 10 years (in writing that now, it actually strikes me how long ago it was bumming smokes at house parties when I was 15) and decided to sack it in on Christmas Day after I'd finished my last pack. I'll be honest, I had a few beers and took another one off my cousin around half 7ish, but I quit on Christmas Day so it's all grand.

I just installed the Quit Now app and put a picture of me, my girlfriend, and my little sister as my cover photo on it. In seeing that I've already got almost 2 days of my life back to spend with those two really caught me off guard and I got a little emotional. This will be the 2nd proper time that I've quit smoking and I don't think I'll cave this time.

Fingers crossed, eh.

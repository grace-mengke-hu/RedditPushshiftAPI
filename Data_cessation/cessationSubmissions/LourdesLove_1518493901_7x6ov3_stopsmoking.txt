I’m craving the thought of the last cigarette.

I know this is so stupid but I’m craving not just a cigarette but like the idea of a last one? Does that make sense? When I had my last cigarette I said my goodbye but it didn’t feel good enough. I know this is my brain romanticizing all of this to get me to cave. 

I’m posting this because we will tell ourselves almost anything to justify one last/more cigarette. Don’t do it. Right now your brain is like split in two. One side is playing devils advocate. The other side is the good guy trying to keep you from smoking. Listen to the good side. 

You got this!!!

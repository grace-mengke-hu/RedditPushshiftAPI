Tip for people who are struggling with more of an appetite after quitting

Nuts. Seriously. I've been smoke free for a long time now and ever since I've struggled with more of an appetite. In an effort to not over eat, my stomach usually ends up growling at some point. Usually at night.

DO NOT eat too many though. They are very filling and easy to over eat on. And expensive. My best suggestion is to eat a handful or two before a meal. I got one of those multi packs at TJ Maxx that has various nuts and fruits in it, and after eating a handful or two I don't have any more hunger pangs at night.

Cold turkey... yet again...

I've quit before. Last year, before the summer began, I did it cold turkey and it lasted a solid 3 months. A year before that I did the patch and I think the only reason that worked was because it scared the shit out of me with the warnings saying "don't smoke while on this patch".


So I'm on Day 6 now, again, and for me it was always the 72-hour limit that was the dividing line. This time though, because of the long labor day weekend, the true test was going back to work. Holy shit did that suck. I was not productive at all and found myself talking to everyone and chewing winter mint gum like a fiend. Tuesday night I got maybe 2 hours of sleep due to the stress of not getting anything done and the (mental) withdrawl. Wednesday I actually left early because I was just too damn tired; everyone could see it in my eyes. Today though... wasn't that bad. A decent night's sleep did me good and I find myself taking "walks" when I feel a big urge.


Anyway, just thought I'd share my experience thus far in case it helps anyone else.

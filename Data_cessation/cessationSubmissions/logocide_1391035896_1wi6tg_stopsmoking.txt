Depression and Quitting

So I've been dealing with depression for a few months now and I recently started getting treatment (medication/ therapy). I'm currently working on improving myself and one of the things I need to do is finally quit.
I've tried numerous times in the past, and I usually get to the one of two month point and eventually end up going back to cigarettes.

My question is: Would it be more effective to taking part in activities I used to enjoy and bring my self esteem back up and then quit? Or should I quit and then attempt to raise my self esteem?

I would ideally like to do both at the same time, but at this point I don't think I could realistically make that big of a change.

This time will be the last one

Hi Guys !

I tried to quit many times.. the first time I quit for 4 years but then back again to these dirty cigarettes...
This time should be the last one.. 3 days so far, everything is ok, some cravings but manageable. As always very difficult to sleep when  I quit.

I have my target, the NY marathon this year; I did many marathons as a smoker lets see if I can do the first one as no smoker !

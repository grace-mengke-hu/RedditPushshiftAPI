Quitting Advice? Need to outsmart myself :/

I’ve tried several times to quit, with zero success. I seem to have this mental block: even though I hate the taste, smell, cost, feeling like shit, and everything else that comes with being a smoker I just can’t seem to get around my own impulsive tendencies and soul-crushing anxiety. 

I tried cold turkey. 
1st time: Got a migraine and puked all day so I picked up a pack when I woke up from the meds (re: legal drug induced sleep) and the headache still wasn’t gone. 5 minutes after that first cig - headache gone. 
2nd time: had a panic attack 2 days in. Injured myself when I eventually passed out and hit the floor too hard. 
3rd time: made it 12 hours before I got the shakes like a damn drug addict and scared myself (thanks, anxiety) into having a cig. 

I tried a few of those countdown apps - the ones where they gradually take cigarettes away and increase the amount of time in between smoke breaks. I found myself smoking even more with those - it’s like I subconsciously panic that something is being taken away, so I have to get more of it in my system before it’s gone? I dunno. Every time I get down to like 10 or less per day, I get this panicky feeling and the urge to have a cig gets 1000x worse. 

I am SICK of being a slave to this expensive and deadly habit. I have severe anxiety, and I KNOW this isn’t helping. I know it’s a stimulant. I’ve been smoking for 15+ years, but I want to be done so badly. 

Any advice for someone who can’t seem to outsmart themselves when it comes to a nicotine addiction?

Quitting is so damn hard... I feel like I'm making things worse.

I could use some encouragement guys. I've been trying to quit for over 2 years now. Started smoking regularly 3 years ago when I was working with a bunch of guys who smoked and I was going through a stressful time (not a good excuse but that's how I justified it). I was smoking about 2-3 packs a week which wasn't so bad and then a friend suggested I try switching to Juul 2 years ago to try quitting. That was the worst thing I could have done... I was burning though way more nicotine that ever before and needed to get buzzed off that thing every waking minute of the day. For the last year I've been using nicotine gum, mints, patches etc., smashed my juul with a hammer in the spring, but I keep relapsing. I've spent so much money on the patches, etc and I'm at a total loss of what to do. Its just such an embarrassing thing for me that I'm ashamed to ask for help but here I am. If you guys have any advice for what I should do I'd be very grateful. Thanks everybody.

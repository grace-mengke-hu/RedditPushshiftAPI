Trying to quit! Need suggestions.

Hello friends, I'm very much new to this thread (literally just discovered it a couple minutes ago), point being is that I really want to quit. Over the last couple months I created a comprehensive guide on how I plan to quit which included a change in diet, workouts, books, etc. My problem I am facing is the actual start of it, I have this fear. I am very nostalgic when it comes to smoking because I associate it with certain things about myself. Every time I think about quitting, I quickly become a fatalist and think, "Oh man, this is going to be the last cigarette ever" and become sad. Any advice?

Also, if you have any extra advice on how to battle the insomnia and nightmare/crazy dream stage I would also love to hear it. I'm 22 (smoking since I was 12) and in my senior year of my undergrad, so sleep and concentration is very important to me at the moment. Thanks everyone!

I'm addicted to smoking but...

I'm more addicted to having and KEEPING a high score. So keep your score, not smoked cigs, money saved, life saved. Write it down or get an app. If you like smoking more than having a highscore, it wil change after a while. And keep in mind that once you smoke just one keeping a same score is for nothing. So either don't light that one or reset your counter. Tell me which will bother you more, not being able to smoke one death stick or deleting a score of something YOU achieved?

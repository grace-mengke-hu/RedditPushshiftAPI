I relapsed after 3 days, I’m very confused..

Hello,

This is my first real quit, it lasted around 3 days, I felt amazing, all the benefits of quitting were just outta this world, I can believe that non smokers feel that way all the time, I am really envious.

Back to my relapse, I basically did nothing for three days straight except going for a jog, so my mind was all the time thinking about smoking but I coped alright, I felt a sorta low mood and lack of will even tho I was energized, so I couldn’t pull myself to do anything to get my mind off it, today I took this nap and woke up groggy and pissed, so I went out and smoked three cigarettes, I am feeling very disappointed, I mainly smoked because I rationalized the idea of quitting next time, very soon, after I start a job and get busy :( now it looks stupid!

How do you cope with slips and relapses? What should I do now? Any insight will be valuable.

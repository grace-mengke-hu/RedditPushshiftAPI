Day 22: I feel like garbage and if you do too, vent here instead of smoking

I've had heartburn maybe twice in my life. But man, do I have it this morning. Out of the blue. And a nice new hacking, phlegmy cough. I'm in such a horrible mood. And I had felt so good the past week too...ugh.

If you're having a shitty morning too, feel free to vent here.

NOT ONE PUFF EVER. It's not going to make anything better!!

Need help!

Hello.. (English is not my first language I am sorry for my language and phrasing)
I have never visited this subreddit and I never thought i would have to. Here is a small background - I am a 22 year old male. I was disgusted by the idea of cigarettes. I was a kind of guy who took a resolve to never smoke in my life. I used to smoke weed very rarely. I just happened to smoke a cigarette recently and i really liked the kick it gave me the first time. I am the kind of guy who likes to mix pleasurable things with masturbation. So this one time i jerked off while smoking. The result was out of this world. I started craving for it soon. In my head i knew that i should stop smoking cause of its adverse effects but once the regular time of my masturbation peaked, i would crave for a cigarette. I have been doing this daily for almost a month now. I am kind of hooked for the momentary pleasure and instantly regret the decision once I am done smoking. I feel its kind of an addiction now. I seriously want to get out of this addiction and I need any help I can get.

Gave up for 3-4 months at the beginning of this year.


Gave up for 3-4 months at the beginning of this year. Done so well. After drinking just had the odd fag then was back on em full time. 

Iâ€™m trying again, day two and I want to give in. Donâ€™t wanna give up for that amount of time again then to smoke again?!  Thinking FUk it go get some beers and fags! 

The early part for stoping is a complete mental head FUk. Makes you battle ur own thoughts. In 2/3 weeks I wonâ€™t even think like this. 

Soooooo long !!??? ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜¬

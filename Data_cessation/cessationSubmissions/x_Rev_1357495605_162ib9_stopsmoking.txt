Looking for e-cig recommendations..

Hello Reddit.

Friday I smoked my last actual cigarette and purchased an e-cig as a way to facilitate moving away from cigarettes. I purchased a Blu disposable to try out and it not bad. Their  starter kits however seem quite pricey and the reviews that I've seen for them have not been the best.
So now I ask you Reddit, do you have any recommendations for e-cigs?

EDIT: Also if you could, post cost per month and how long they usually last. Much appreciated.

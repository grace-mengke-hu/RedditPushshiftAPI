I'm quitting tomorrow!

Tomorrow is the day that I get off of this disgusting roller-coaster! I've tried to quit in the past using lozenges and other things, but I have never had any success. I've decided I'm going cold turkey, and this time I will succeed!

The top five reasons I want to quit are as follows:

* I want to be able to ride my bike without getting winded

* I want to have a better sex life with my fiance

* I want to save the money that I spend on this nasty habit and invest it

* I don't want to smell like an ash tray all day long

* I want to use the time I normally spend smoking doing more productive things

The cravings are most likely going to hit me at the following times:

* When I wake up

* When drinking with friends

* After meals

* When I get bored at work

* When I get bored at home

I have one more smoke left in this pack, and once it's gone, I intend to stop FOREVER. I'll have to fight the urges to smoke when I'm bored or after I eat, and I'll probably stop drinking for a few weeks until I get the nicotine out of my system. 

Wish me luck, everyone. Big thanks to /u/sstf for the motivation found in this thread: http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/1eu4aj/did_you_know_quitting_smoking_sucks_then_feels/ca3y9zu?context=3

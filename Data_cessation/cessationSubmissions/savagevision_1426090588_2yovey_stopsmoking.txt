Failed Again After 2 Months

I've tried so many times and I'm getting tired of it all.  I just want to not have to try any more.  When will I be able to rid of the desire?  Or will it be a constant, conscious struggle for as long as I live?  I'm not sure when I'm going to try and quit again, but I'm going to have to try something different next time.

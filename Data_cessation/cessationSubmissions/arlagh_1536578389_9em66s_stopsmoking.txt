The willpower!

I have been smoke free for the past 7 days and this morning I almost felt like I couldn't take it anymore . My mind was rushing and telling me that I can always quit later and that a smoke will solve all.of my problems. So i put my sneakers on and got out of the house... You might think that this was it, but it wasn't! I fought and here I am winning one of the harfest battles I ever fought! God bless you guys and all those who read this, man I love you all! Your life is your life so let it be, SMOKE FREE!

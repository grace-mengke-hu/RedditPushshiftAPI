I've discovered one hell of a way to fend off cravings...yoga.

My girlfriend is a yoga instructor and generally a very healthy person. After I quit smoking and realized how good it felt to be healthier, I started making other changes to my lifestyle, like going to bed at a more reasonable hour, eating more fruits/vegetables (smoothies FTW) and, after years of resistance, doing yoga.

I always thought yoga was just some hippie thing because I know so many people who do yoga and talk about it like it's a spiritual journey or some shit like that. My girlfriend talked me into it as a workout routine. It really has been perfect, you work out your entire body at the same time, while also doing cardio. It's like condensing a week's worth of work at the gym into the same daily routine.

The side benefit I've discovered is that it absolutely ANNIHILATES cravings. If I get a craving, I'll just get up, put on some calming music and do yoga for maybe 10 minutes or so. Goodbye to cravings, and also hello to actually having some muscle definition for the first time in over a decade!

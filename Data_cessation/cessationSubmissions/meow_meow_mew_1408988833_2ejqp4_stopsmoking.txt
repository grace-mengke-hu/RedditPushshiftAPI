If I had stuck with it, I would be going on a year smoke free.

Almost one year ago exactly I made this username for the purpose of posting on r/stopsmoking.  It was a week before my 24th birthday and I just decided it was time to stop smoking.  That lasted a couple weeks at most and then I decided that I could be a "social smoker" within about two months I was back to my old habit.  Half a pack a day.  I had completely given up.

Recently I had been thinking about quitting again so today I looked up this username that I abandoned so long ago and realized that it had been almost a year exactly since my last attempt at quitting.  

I'm not really sure what the point was in my posting this.  I just want to say that I wish I had stuck with it a year ago.  I would be posting about how much better I feel after not smoking for a year and I would be proud of myself for accomplishing something that has felt impossible for so long.  Instead I feel weak for letting such a disgusting habit control my life.  

I'll be 25 in a week.  This has to stop.

Sore Throat!!

Hello you lovely lot! 
Quick question. For the last few days the back of my throat has been feeling like I have smoked to many cigarettes. Very sore, no glands up, no feeling crappy. Just this sore throat and very thirsty. I am yet to have the coughing up gross stuff stage. And wondered if this could be the start of it?? Or I could just be getting ill. But don't feel ill! Suppose after smoking for 20 years it may just be taking sometime for the body to recover! Just wondered if anyone had had something similar? As it is beginning to get on my nerves! Thanks! x

Dilemma

So... I’ve given up smoking a few times and for some reason always start back up again. I’m at the point now where I don’t smoke all day and now I’ve started having 2 or 3 in the evening as well. I’m using the nrt patches, I got to the point where I’d even weened myself off them so I just can’t understand why I keep feeling the need to smoke again. I’m not really sure what to do?

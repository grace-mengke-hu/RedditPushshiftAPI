Just found this today.

Not new to reddit but I am new to this subreddit. I quit cold turkey 3 weeks ago today. It has been very difficult and at work I have come off as an intolerable asshole. I don't want to be that guy but after deciding to eat right, exercise, stop drinking and smoking it is alot of hard life changes at one time and is quite difficult. Had I known this subreddit existed, I would have been here much sooner. I know some of you understand my burden, how did you get through it?

What I miss most...

This will sound incredibly stupid when I type it out, but what I seem to miss is that feeling in my throat/lungs as I inhale. Its ridiculous because that is literally me choking myself. But when I am just sitting around, I notice not having that feeling the most.

Also, its been almost 6 days, haven't noticed my taste or smell changing, but holy shit, does caffeine hit me a lot harder. I used to be able to drink 3 or 4 cups a day. Now, after a second cup, I feel like I am about to explode.

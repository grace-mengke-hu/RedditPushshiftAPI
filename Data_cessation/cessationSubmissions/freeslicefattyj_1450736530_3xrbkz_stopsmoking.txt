Didn't realize it was my one year anniversary until making a joke about ash trays to my mother.

I made guacamole for a holiday party at my parents' house and my mother brought out two small porcelain bowls in the shape of New Zealand for holding food (she recently returned from a vacation).  I said, "Huh, if it were about a year ago, I would have assumed those were ash trays."  Then I thought about it and realized it was a year to the day!

Cheers guys, I would have never thought it was possible, and then realized it was something that I wanted.  I also realized that I deserve everything I want as long as I am willing to work for it.  Hang in there and happy holidays!  Gets better every day!

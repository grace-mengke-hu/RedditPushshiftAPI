I know this is a quit smoking cigarette subreddit, but I hope you can support a previous smoker/turned vapor finally trying to quit nicotine all together.

I used a Juul because of the insane amount of nicotine and it being the only kind of vape that hit like a cig and gave me the same buzz. Just quit today. I’m 7 hours in and I feel like I’m going to jump out of my skin.

Has anyone successfully gotten off of a tobacco company mailing list? I don't need coupons anymore.

I still get coupons in the mail once every week or two from Camel. I don't need them or want them, and I don't ever want the possibility of temptation. 
  
Does anyone know the easiest way to get off of their mailing list? A couple of weeks ago I called some 800 number, and after a lot of waiting, I got some person who didn't seem to know how to help me. 

Any advice?

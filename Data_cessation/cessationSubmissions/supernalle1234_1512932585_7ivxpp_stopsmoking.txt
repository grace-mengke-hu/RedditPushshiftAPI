Last cig. Anxiety/Depression sufferer.

I'm about to go out for my last cig. Tomorrow starts my millionth time quitting.
I have anxiety and depression and from what I read quitting smoking will help me in the long run. Short-term not so much. I have been smoke free for 1-2 months before and felt better, but my stupid brain always lured me back in. :(

Made a post a few days ago as well but if anyone with anxiety/depression wants to chime in, then I would love to hear how quitting smoking brought some relief for you.

Thanks guys!

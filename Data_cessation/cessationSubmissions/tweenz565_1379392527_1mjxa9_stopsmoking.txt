I am finally free!

At 12:22am I had my last cigarette EVER!  I am so pumped!  I have lurked stopsmoking for a long time now and am so excited to be free from nicotine.  Thank you for introducing me to EASY WAY and showing me not only that it is possible, but there are a ton of other people to celebrate this with.

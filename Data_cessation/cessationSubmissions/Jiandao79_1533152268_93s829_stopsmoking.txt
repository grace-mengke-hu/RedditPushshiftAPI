Just smoked my last one.

Writing this for me. 

I’ve been a smoker for 24 years (started when I was 15) and the longest I’ve ever gone without was two weeks. 

I never enjoy it any more and just smoke due to associating certain tasks with having a cigarette before, during or after the task. 

I always told myself that I’d give up after having kids, but that happened 18 months ago and I didn’t even try. 

I hate the guilty feeling I get when my kids want to hug me after I’ve had a smoke. I hate the fact that I started smoking in the car and the car reeks of it when I’m strapping the kids into their car seats. 

Going to go cold turkey and determined to do it this time.

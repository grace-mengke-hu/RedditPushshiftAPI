I Really Need Help to Quit

I'm 22 years old. I go to College and will graduate soon. All the stress from school and life got me to smoke. I really hate cigarettes but I quickly became addicted to them from all the stress and pressure. I've tried quitting cold turkey but I ended up smoking again after a few months. I got a vap. but it didnt work out very well. Now I smoke cigarettes and the Vap. I really want to quit and I'm hoping for advice from all of you. 

Edit: I've officially quit since yesterday afternoon. I'm not giving myself anymore excuses because I truly want to quit. I bought the nicotine gum and lollipops to help, but I plan to stop the gum soon. Also I got the book  that one of you mentioned. It seems pretty interesting so far. My only problem is that ever since I quit, I feel like I've been getting shortness of breath, and I feel a lot of fatigue lately.

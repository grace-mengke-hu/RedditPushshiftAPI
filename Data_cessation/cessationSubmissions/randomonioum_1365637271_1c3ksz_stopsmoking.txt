I didn't consider myself a non-smoker until today...

I know that The easy way to stop smoking is suggested a lot here, but... I didn't honestly trust that it would work. I read it today, because I thought why not. I went out, smoked my last cigarette (after getting back on the wagon, resetting my badge after this!), and though, why not, it can't hurt. And, well. It worked. All I can suggest to all of you trying is, even if you think it would never work, its the silliest thing you've ever heard of: Just try it. You're already trying to break a habit, why not read a book too? Give it a go, whats the worst that can happen, at most, you lose an hour or two reading it. And if it DOES work, even if you don't think it will, then the reward HAS to be worth it. Again, I know this has been posted around all over the place, but I cannot stress what an effect the book had on me. Go ahead, read it back to front, and see for yourself. What do you have to lose?

Cold Turkey Fail at 1 week...

Context: New account for privacy. Smoked nearly a pack a day for the last year and change. Have ADD and on Vyvanse. Quit cold turkey last week.

Today I took my meds, didn’t go to the dog park as usual in the AM because of rain, had coffee (don’t usually do caffeine and meds together) and started to work. Then I started to freak out, over stressed,  and hyper focused on work. When I couldn’t take it anymore I went and bought a pack and have now had two and counting...

Thinking I need a self imposed immediate consequence for times like this. My willpower was close to winning but the stress collapsed me.
Any thoughts or suggestions?
Also do I throw this whole pack away?
Ugh.
Gotta get back on the wagon.

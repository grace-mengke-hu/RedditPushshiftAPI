Can't stand reading comments that say "it gets easier"

because even though it might very well be true for many (and probably most) it hasn't for me. After 2 months, I still have cravings literally every 5 minutes and it has NOT gotten easier, not one bit. So whenever I read those comments, I think "fuck you and your lies" in my head. Anyway...just needed to vent...apologies for being a "Debbie Downer".

Meditation / Acupuncture

Hello everyone :) 

I started to experiment with tea a while back. While it gave me that little extra healthy feeling, it couldn't prevent me from smoking. I still drink as much as possible (even bought a tea-flask-thing for work) but I came to the conclusion that I need something else as well. About a month ago I resumed my meditation-practice (I sort of stopped during summer 2016 and replaced it with weed for some reason) 

Do some people around here meditate? Any experiences? 

Also, I started to see an acupuncture-therapist. Today I had the first meeting and asked her to assist me with my quit-project, stress, appetite-issues and low energy levels. After a massage and some needles, I felt quite relaxed and didn't have a craving so far. :) 

Does someone has experience with acupuncture related with quitting? 

Stay away from those filthy things :)

I'm looking forward to your comments :)

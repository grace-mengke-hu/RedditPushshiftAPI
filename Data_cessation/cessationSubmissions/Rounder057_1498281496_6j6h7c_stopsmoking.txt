50 hours in

Well, I am 50 hours in now. Today was much worse on several fronts. I was exploding with rage inside and out. Everything felt like a chore that required all of my focus. 1 can of redbull sent my anxiety into the stratosphere, so it turns out that caffeine is bad. I know that I am a lot closer to getting this over with. I honestly think the worst may almost be over with. No matter how bad it gets,
This is not forever 
This is worth it.

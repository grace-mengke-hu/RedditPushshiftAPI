1 year, 1 day :)

So, as bummed as I was to find out I missed my 1 year smoke free anniversary by a day, I just had to post again into this subreddit to thank you guys for all your encouragement and support.  This sub is truly the SOLE reason I was able to successfully quit a year ago; nowadays, smoking hardly ever crosses my mind, and it astounds me to think I am a former smoker.  For those of you just starting out, stay the course.  It gets more bearable.  I recommend a combination of checking this sub every day, downloading a quit app for your phone, and sunflower seeds! (I still have such an oral fixation that, for long, multi-hour drives, I get very anxious if I don't have several big bags of seeds to chew on). 

That's all I've got.  I wish you all the best of luck in your quitting endeavors, and I congratulate those of you, like myself, that have had a successful and meaningful quitting experience.  Much love guys.

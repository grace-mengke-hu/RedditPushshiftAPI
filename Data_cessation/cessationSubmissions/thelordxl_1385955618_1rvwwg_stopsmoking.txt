I need help quitting

Hey all.  Been smoking for about 5-6 years.

I've quit a several times in the past. Usually for a period of a few months.  But I keep coming back.

I don't really have an addictive personality.  Alcohol, Caffeine, Cannabis don't have a problem with at all.

But nicotine, there is just something about it that I can't live without.  And stress always brings me back to it.  Nothing helps me deal with stress like nicotine does.  Every time something terrible happens or I go though a rough patch, a cigarette is the only thing that can calm me.

I don't even like the taste of it, save for pipe tobacco, which I absolutely love.

My mother died of lung cancer, and I really am afraid of suffering the same fate, but I feel powerless whenever stress grabs a hold of me.  I think of death all the time, and it consumes me because I feel like I am destined to it.  I can't even imagine living without cigarettes because I would just be miserable all the time and kill myself anyway at some point.

How can I get rid of stress being a trigger for nicotine?

The cliche answers have been attempted and they do not work.  I'm also the first to admit that my own willpower is not strong at all.

Like I said, I can quit no problem, its just that I can't deal with my stress and stay tobacco free.

Time flies

Holy shit guys... 195 days have passed since I quit.

I quit when I found out I was pregnant and vowed that I wouldn't start smoking again when I had my son. Well, he's going to be 5 weeks old tomorrow and I still haven't picked up a cig. I want to, but unlike 195 days ago, I have the will power to say no!

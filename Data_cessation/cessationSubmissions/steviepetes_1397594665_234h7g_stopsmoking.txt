Day one...going really well!

I've been a smoker for 11 years and got up to nearly a pack a day. I resisted smoking a pack a day just to make sure I couldn't say I was a "pack a day smoker". I've quit twice before, long-term (2 years, 1 year) and both quits were MISERABLE. Day one I was usually a mess.

Today I'm...fine. Slightly foggy but not that crazy. I went to an acupuncture session around lunch time and it was awesome. I've never tried that! Then I sat in a steam room for a good 10 minutes. 

I think this time I'm just ready and done with it. Re-reading Easyway last night really helped everything sink in! Goodbye, cigarettes. I won't miss you.

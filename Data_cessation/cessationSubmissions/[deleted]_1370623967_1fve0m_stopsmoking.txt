Quitting For Good

I have quite a dozen times. But having started smoking at the age of ten and promising myself I would quit before it had been a decade, it is time. Mainly as it has actually been a decade and a half now...I am 25, and still puffing away. '

Over the last year I have kept my smoking in a 2 - 3 a day range. Sometimes I do as little as 1. With the number so low, why am I even smoking at all? So the day before yesterday I decided not to buy a new pack when I ran out. I am now on day two of no cigarettes. 

What I have noticed is that yesterday was easy. Today is harder and I feel anxious. More so than in the past, when my quitting has been obviously temporary. Knowing this is it has me in a half panic, but I know it will get better.

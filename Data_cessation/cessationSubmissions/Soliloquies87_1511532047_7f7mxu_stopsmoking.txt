100 days smoke free

I made it to 100 days. I don't feel like a smoker anymore, it really feels like a page turned. I want to thanks people on this subs for putting up with me in the first 2 weeks, these were truly the worst phase. After that, though I always wanted to eat something and maybe gained 5 pounds over the course of 3 months, I can tell you it get much easier. So anyone reading this and starting their journey, I say grab a buddy here, someone who stopped smoking at the same time as you, and start writing to them every 12 hours or so. For me it helped a lot to be able to talk about my frustrations to someone who understand (all my friends are non smoker or ex-smokers).

I saved money, my teeth are whiter, my skin looks better, I smell good, I can taste things again and my anxiety dropped dramatically. So do it! It's worth it.

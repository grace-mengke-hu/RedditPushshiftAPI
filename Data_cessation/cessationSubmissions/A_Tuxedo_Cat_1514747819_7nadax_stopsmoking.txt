I'm quitting smoking, and I don't know why

First off, I'm not a long term smoker. I've maybe been smoking for about 6 months, and I never smoked more than half a pack a day at my worst. However, I decided about 4 days ago that I would stop smoking for unknown reasons before I head to university, and it's been a pain in the ass.

Since I've quit, I've already started to feel better. I feel like my workouts are more intense, and I'm excited not to run out of stamina during sex as often. I'm also saving cash and saving myself from the long term consequences of smoking. However, I feel like it's inevitable that I'll pick up smoking again. I never had a real reason to quit in the first place, and I'm really searching for one now. Sure, I feel better, but I loved smoking. It really eased my anxiety, and as a very naturally anxious person, I miss that feeling of calm an incredible amount. I also miss smoking while driving, since I'm a very anxious driver, and even just sitting outside for 5 mins and relaxing with a cigarette in my hand.

So, maybe I'm naive for asking this, but can anybody give me a reason not to start smoking again? Whenever I think of any reason not to, it's easy for me to just brush it off. I don't know how to deal with my nerves, and I discovered that smoking has been a saving grace for me in that regard. With university starting soon, I know I'm going to be a wreck, especially since it's my first time living away from home, too. What else can I do to deal with my nerves? Why shouldn't I start smoking again if it made me feel so much better?

Thanks in advance for all the responses. Maybe I'm just going through withdrawals. Who knows.

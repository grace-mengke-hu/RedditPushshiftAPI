Why is this so hard?

I feel like such a failure. I’ve been a smoker for over 10 years and my feeble quit attempts have never lasted for more than 4 days. I decided to quit, for real, starting on the first of this year. I’ve read Alan Carr’s book. I downloaded the apps. I bought nicoderm patches. I did well for about 2 1/2 days. I had mild boredom-induced cravings here and there but it was much less torturous with the patches than it’s been when I tried quitting cold turkey.
Then today, at work, those really evil cravings kicked in. The insatiable ones- the ones that make you think, “I don’t care THAT much about quitting, do I?”
I have a job where I work with smokers, and I have a lot of high-stress periods followed by really quiet periods... the perfect storm. I’m a hairstylist, so I would always go out back while my clients processed or while waiting for my next one. But now, panic sets in when I’m finishing with a client. Where do i go, now? What do I do? How do I reward myself for all my hard work? 
It’s pathetic. It’s kind of crazy how strong the psychological hold is. I’m already getting nicotine from patches... but the actual act is so habitual and insidious. I KNOW why I’m quitting, and on a logical level, I want to be done with smoking, but my addict-brain overrides that and starts making me think that smoking isn’t that bad, and I can always quit later, and an immediate cigarette is all I need to be happy and satisfied.
I ended up cracking and bumming a smoke (or three) from a coworker. I feel like I’m doomed and weak... do I really have this little self control? 😞
I feel like I just need like some other little thing to do in place of smoking but I’m worried that that “little thing” will become eating, and I really don’t want to gain weight. Any tips?

Made it over a month, booya

It feels good. The cravings are gone for the most part... I mean they still float around sometimes but they're not bad at all. I'm almost a week into quitting drinking too... just really trying to clean up my life and this has been an amazing start. I thought smoking was a way of taming my anxiety, it turns out it was massively contributing to it. When I was smoking a cigarette, sure, stress and anxiety weren't around. But as soon as I was done with that smoke, they would come back with reinforcements. My breathing is incredibly better, I can actually exercise without needing to stop for five minute breaks to catch my breath. My teeth are whitening up and my breath is better, the initial disgusting taste that I and a lot of others get after quitting is gone... and I've been told I look healthy by people who don't know I've quit. One person explained that my skin just looks better, and I'm just a little brighter. I don't know if that means I always looked sick when I was smoking, but hey, I'll still take it as a compliment.

It's amazing how much lurking in forums like this and /r/stopdrinking have helped me take steps to gaining control of my mind and body. Thanks to all of you for sharing your experiences and support, and to everyone who is just a few days in, keep your chin up! Trust me, it gets easier and life is better without cigarettes!

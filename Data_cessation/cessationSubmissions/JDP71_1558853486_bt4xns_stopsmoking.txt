Smoke free app &amp; quit date

A week into quitting, had a slip up after a couple of beers. When you add a craving and you smoked it gives you the option of resetting your quit date but warns it might be demotivating, do you guys reset or just accept it was a blip and stick with the counters as they are (and why?)

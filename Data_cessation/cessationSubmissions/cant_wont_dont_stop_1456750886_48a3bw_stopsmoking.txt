Dealing with lack of breaks and drinking

I quit smoking a couple of days ago (for like third time) and afraid to lapse because of two reasons. First of all in like 20 years of smoking I got used to routine - once an hour I grab a cigarette and go outside to have a smoke. Second, while I don't feel any kind of physical craving while sober, I really want to smoke while even a bit drunk, and I don't intend on quitting drinking. Any advice on how to deal with this stuff?

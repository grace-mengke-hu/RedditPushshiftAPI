Cravings Almost gone.

Stopped for 12 days now. Cravings dropped in half by day 4 couldnt believe it and now i may get 1 craving a day if that! and it lasts no time at all. I know it'll probably come back when i least expect it but ill be ready.
I actually was at work and found 3 cigerettes in a box on the side. Had a smell thought nope not for me and left them there. Obviously becausing taking them would have been stealing haha but i had no feeling to actually smoke one of them at all.

Good luck all and rememeber when cravings occur read some posts on here it keeps you busy.

I have smoked for 25 years and decided to stop before i become a daddy. No better reason to stop not goingtl to make my child suffer.

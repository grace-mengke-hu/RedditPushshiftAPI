I quit smoking, it's day 3.

It's currently 3:32am and I can't sleep. I guessing it's from the withdrawals, but I have a vape I've been using so iuno. Anyways, I've been smoking cigs since I was 17 and now I'm 23. I've "quit" 100 times before, but this is the first time in 6 years I've gone 3 days without touching a cigarette. I'm super proud of myself right now lol. I like being alive, so hopefully this is it.

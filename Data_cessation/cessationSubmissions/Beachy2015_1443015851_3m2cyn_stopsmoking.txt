Has anyone used the kerry gaynor method?

My apologies if I am doing this all wrong.  I have never seen or used reddit prior to this morning.  I came here through a link on my Smoke Free app.  I have been looking for a "social support" group, and from reading some of the posts and comments - this looks to be a really great place for support when quitting.  I think I have over-quit my welcome on facebook.  I get the feeling my friends and family are tired of seeing me post "this is it - i am really quitting this time".  My younger children don't really get how hard it is and even though my husband just quit 4 days ago, he's not the most supportive at these type of things.

Anyways, just thought I would see if anyone in this group has tried kerry's dvds.  I got them and listened to them (discs 1 and 2, as directed) last July, and I know that I quit for at least 41 hours (and was happy about it) from a journal entry I wrote.  But I don't recall anything about why I slipped and started back up again.  This past Monday I listened to dvd #1 again and can listen to dvd #2 on day 5-7 - so that would be Saturday, Sunday or Monday.  I have been planning to listen to it on Monday.

Oh and just for some background on my smoking - 30 years - a pack a day.  I quit once 20 years ago for 3 months, and 3 years ago I quit for 3 weeks.  I have attempted to quit a dozen other times but never made it past day 3.  I have used Chantix, patches, gum, cold turkey, alan carr easyway, kerry gaynor method.

Sorry for such a long post - I am definitely a newbie here - and I appreciate your time.  Thanks!

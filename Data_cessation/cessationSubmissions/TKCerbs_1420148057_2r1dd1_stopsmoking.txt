How can I (non-smoker) help my girlfriend actually stop smoking?

For 2015, my gf, a life-long smoker, resolved to quit for the hundredth time.  We agreed to tandem our resolutions together (mine to be to a fitness based goal) and work with each other on accomplishing them.

It is now 1:32 in the afternoon, we've been awake for 3 hours after a LONG new years eve, and she is already crumbling and asking me where I put the last pack that she had on her last night (I've learned to stop flushing them, because then she just spends more money on buying them).

3 hours in, and she is already giving up on it.  How do I help her?

Relapsed and have some questions

Hello guys and sorry for my bad English. I quit smoking, fapping and watching porn 26 days ago, 8 of March. fapping and porn didn't affect me even a little bit but smoking, this god damn thing ruined my brain. I smoked 2 cigarettes today and feel like shit. And after smoking today, realized that smoking wasn't the problem. the problem is I couldn't replace it with something else. After brakes or before getting started to something, etc. and the urges, they were crazy, man. When I stay home bc. of the midterm exams and other things, I felt urges harder (3-4 hours of urges sometimes). After the two cigarettes, I feel like shit now. And thats what I want to ask about. Whenever I smoke, I feel terribly down after it. Losing my joy and energy to do anything and I don't know why. Usually, when people smoke, they feel ready to do the homeworks or start to study but I feel exactly opposite, lose my joy, happiness etc. Do you know why? Also what weird is when I don't smoke, I feel crazy to smoke before I start to do something. I don't know how to explain exactly but thats it. I don't wanna smoke tomorrow and will try to quit also, do you have any idea about my problem and any advice for me to get this quitting shit easier?

Day 3

I'm on day 3 of no nicotine. I have smoked and dipped interchangeably for the past 2 years. I don't feel many withdrawls symptoms which kind of confuses me. It makes me very nervous for day 5 whenever they reach their peak. What does everyone think of this?  Allen carr's easyway method is the way I'm quitting. If that helps.

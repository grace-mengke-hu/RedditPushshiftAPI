Has anyone quit smoking but not nicotine?

I want to quit smoking, but I never in my life want to quit nicotine. I have 0 desire to give up my nicotine addiction. I couldn't care less about being addicted to nicotine, or spending money on patches or gum for the rest of my life, but I do not want to be a smoker the rest of my life.

I understand that most people want to quit the addiction altogether, but that is just not my desire. Has anyone else done it like this? Is it dumb as hell to even try?

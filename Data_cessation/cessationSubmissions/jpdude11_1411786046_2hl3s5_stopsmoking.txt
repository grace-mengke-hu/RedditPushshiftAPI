I need advice and encouragement.

I haven't been smoking that long, or that much. I started in July, and at my worst it was a pack a week and my current pack (or formerly current pack) lasted me over a month, but I threw that pack away and I'm quitting. Tonight. I'm terrified though. I'm really young (too young to be smoking that's for sure) and I don't want to fuck up my lungs or get cancer and all of that. How can I semi-reverse the effects of smoking thus-far? What can I expect in my future considering the amount/duration I've smoked? Any advice or encouragement is appreciated. Thanks you guys.

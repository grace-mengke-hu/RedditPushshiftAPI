3rd time in a year that I've posted here with the intent to quit. This time I decided to do something differently.

So I've been drug and alcohol free for over 16 months now and have kept a blog about my progress. I've tried abstaining from cigarettes a few times throughout this journey, but keep getting pulled back. 

Today makes 3 weeks nicotine free (cold turkey), but I had some pretty bad cravings yesterday. So I added a post to my blog about quitting smoking in hopes that I'm able to replicate the same results I had with quitting heroin. Hopefully it sticks this time.

Day 1

Today has been okay. Luckily I was able to read Allen Carr's advice last night and it really helped reinforce what I knew deep down. I had to work today, and it has not been as bad as my initial smoking self thought it would. I am cheating a bit and using the patch and gum - I know myself and I wanted to work towards my mental/emotional addiction first. My mind is accepting it and I know this is only the first day and I have a long road ahead before I will ween off the nic and feel "normal" only this time I am truly excited about it--about being a non smoker. And I have full confidence in myself, and all of you out there. WE WILL DO IT!

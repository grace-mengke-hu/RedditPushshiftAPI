This is the day I begin living again

So, I'm a little different than yall because I don't (never have) smoke cigarettes, but I am finished with smoking the plant.

 I previously used it to help me get through a really depressing and anxiety filled time. I took antidepressants and antianxiety medication but they made me either feel really manic then really depressive or made me throw up and not be able to eat anything for weeks. To counter a lot of that, I smoked. I then just stopped taking the medications all together because they were doing more harm than good and I was making good progress in therapy. I would go to therapy, listen and absorb as much information as I could then go home and smoke and think about what I learned. Think those positive thoughts and believe them! It was great. 

Then after almost 2 years of doing that, I realized that it had all worked and I was actually happy for the first time in a very, very long time. I quit going to therapy and I was still doing great! But I still kept smoking. 

These past few weeks I've been wanting to stop but never actually did anything about it until tonight. Tonight was the last time I smoke. I am no longer using it for medicine. It's no longer helping me like it was. 

I AM HAPPY!!!!!!

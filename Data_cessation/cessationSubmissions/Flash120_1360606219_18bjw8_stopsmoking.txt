Went through my 21st birthday without a cigarette

on Thursday i had my 21st birthday, and had friends up from home to visit me. I was shithoused the entire weekend to say the least, but i didn't have a cigarette. I was offered a lit one on more than one occasion and turned it down. 

This willpower thing feels absolutely incredible. I feel like i have a power over myself that i didn't know about when i was a smoker. If i can do it so can you.

Smoked since i was 15, quit on new years. 

Stay strong everyone.

I think I can make it a year without smoking.

Hi guys. To start off, I never thought I was addicted and I still don't. I'm a social smoker and I've been doing it around a year and a half. But I've never had cravings and sometimes my "occasional" smokes are 2-3 weeks apart. 

But anyways, I know how social smokers get addicted very quickly, so I've always been "careful" not to let myself go too much. Last Christmas I had 2 week long vacation with lots of socializing with old friends from my hometown. I smoked around 10 cigarettes a day for 2 weeks straight and got scared that I'll get addicted. So I decided to stop smoking for a year.

My last smoke was December 31st, 23:58. I'm cigarette free this year. I haven't had any bad cravings yet I think. But I hate how I'm not even allowed to have them in moderation. I rarely quit stuff forever, more often than not I just reduce my intake of that thing immensely.

Anyways. I felt like sharing. Thanks for listening to my bitching guys. :)

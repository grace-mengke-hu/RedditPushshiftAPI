First temptations in a while

I quit cigarettes around a month ago only to pick up cigars. A few of my friends still smoke and I picked up a cigarette two weeks ago because the stogie shop was closed. That was the first time in a while I really noticed how bad the tobacco tasted in my mouth, and I could feel it doing damage to my throat as I inhaled. I have quit before only to come back smoking more than I had originally, for the past week I've noticed temptations and for the first time today I felt an extremely strong urge to buy a pack of cigarettes. I've noticed I go back and forth from hot to cold as if I have a mild fever. I can feel acne beginning to break out. And I can really taste in my mouth and throat how bad smoking has been for my breath and throat in general. Just keep going I suppose.

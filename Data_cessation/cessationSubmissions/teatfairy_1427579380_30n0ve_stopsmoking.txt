First day working as a non smoker.

Got into a fight with my boyfriend this morning. Boss was in a pissy mood. I just want to go home and curl up in a ball.

I'm starting to get the feeling that I'm not ready to quit but I can't distinguish between me and the addiction yet. I'm really flusteres and have been on the verge of tears all day. :(

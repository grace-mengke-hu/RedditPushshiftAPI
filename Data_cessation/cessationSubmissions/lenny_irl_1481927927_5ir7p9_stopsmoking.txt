I miss the break?

Hey guys

I don't know how to describe it...but besides obvious withdrawal effects I really miss the 5 minute breaks you get when smoking. Like talking to other smokers when in clubs or bars and/or just watching the stars and thinking when you're by yourself at home.

What can you do about that? Should I just go outside for a few minutes and think about everything? Any tips?

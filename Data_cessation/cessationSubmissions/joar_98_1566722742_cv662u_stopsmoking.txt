Small Experiment

I've been smoking for four years now, never really wanted to start smoking. But movies, books and friends were a big influence. I thought of quitting several times but all my efforts have gone in vain. Also one thing is that friends will always have a negative impact on trying to quit smoking except a few. This time I am using a method, I don't know if it'll be useful or not. I didn't stop overnight. The day I thought about quitting this useless and harmful habit, I had a packet of cigarettes which contains 10 and smoked them all. The next day I had 9 and so on. The problem started when the day of having four cigarettes arrived, don't worry I've kept my nerves straight and today is the last day of this experiment. I'll have one after dinner and that's the last one I am having 'ever'. I hope this time's the last.

My expierence.

Hey, Stopsmoking Community,

I want to share my expierences of quitting and why i relapsed.

My smoking "carrer" started when i was 12. My mom caught me and made it clear that if i continue to smoke she will tell to my grandma/grandpa. Because i loved them,  i stopped. This worked for few years. 

Second start was teenage, rebelous years. And it continued to a time of my studies at university. At some point during studies i started to see smoking as a bad thing. And with my friend we made a bet of some money to stop smoking. This worked for 6 months. Failure of this bet  was due our stresfull exam session, lack of knowledge about smoking itself, friendship and mutual agreement to cancel bet(we basically agreed to start smoke again) 

Third start and the longest period of smoking was my after studies, work and serious relationship era. Stress on all aspects of life made attempts to quit look like impossible task. Me and me ex girlfriend tried few times, but we couldn't handle smoke free life more than a week.

Post break up era (in which i am currently in) is kinda messy. A lot of stress, bad emotions, depression, nostalgia,new environment. Looks like reality of my life got hard on me so smoking was a bad way to cope with bad times.
During this period i managed to quit smoking 3 times:

First time for about 5 months. Restarted at holidays. Urge to smoke striked really hard and i couldn't resist mix of alcohol, good weather and old friends.

After 3 months of relapse, one morning, i decided  to quit(again) . Managed not to smoke for about 3 months, but i started to smoke weed joints (like two times a month, and it consisted tobacco ). It helped with cravings, but i started to smoke them more frequently to substitute cigarette cravings, and after a while restarted normal ciggaretes. 

Current attempt is 3rd time in 2018-2019 to quit this bad habbit, looks like it will be the easiest. So i will write what worked for me and what didn't:

- reddit community - definately helps at a start to a point where you do not come to a group and think you are non smoker and quitted forever. 

- tracking apps - didn't find it really helpfull. It's only a reminder of a thing you should not do in the first place. 

- friends -  try to avoid smokers (at least at start). And engage into more activities with not smoking ones. 

- alcohol - one of the biggest triggers, i would avoid it at all costs. 

- financial motive - you can buy something you want with all that extra money, what motivated me was i could spend more money on better food and supplements. 

- diet - plenty of water helps to reduce cravings, sugary foods triggers cravings. 

- activities - some exercises or outdoor sports motivates not to smoke or shows you how affected you are already (fatigue, etc). 

- health - didn't notice much of a difference in health after quiting, but less headaches, less short of breath during some physical activities, little better sleep.

I lurked here a lot and it helped my mind not to go back to full smoker mindset and all these threads with new non smokers kept that itch inside me and here we go - i'm not smoking for a while at the moment, no cravings, no constant thinking about it. I hope it stays that way. Thank you.

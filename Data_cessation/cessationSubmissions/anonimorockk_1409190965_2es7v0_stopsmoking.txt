10 daya without smoking

Hi people, before I star, sorry about my English. Im from Argentina. I stoped smoking 10 days ago and today I have my first craving, a extremely one. All started because I bought a coffee and it's was and instinct to open my bag to take a cigarette that of course I didn't have it. In the first place I thought that something what's missing, I thing that for a while don't go to drink coffe to hahaha its a bad idea? help me up with the cravings.

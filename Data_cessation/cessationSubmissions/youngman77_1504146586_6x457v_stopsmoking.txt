I think I need help stopping this early on

Hey guys, throwaway account.  I'm a 16 year old boy with what I would consider to be pretty good health.  I run 20+ miles a week and weightlift casually.  But recently I've started smoking cigarettes.  For almost 3 years now I've been religiously smoking weed with friends 2-3 times a week.  I know it's bad, but for the most part I have felt fine, no bad cough or fatigue.  But in the past 3 weeks I've been starting to smoke cigarettes when I don't have weed available.  I started off very very light by smoking 1 or 2 cigarettes a week.  I'd tell myself that I would only allow cigarettes when I'm very stressed out.  But over the past couple of weeks my will power has faded.  I have been smoking 3-4 a day and I can't seem to stop.  My body literally demands I get a smoke in.  I want to know some good techniques for quitting, this is getting out of hand and I can't stop on my own.  Will my lungs ever recover?

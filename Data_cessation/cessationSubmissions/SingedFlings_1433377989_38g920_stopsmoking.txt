Kicked it finally!

I have finally completely gone off of cigarettes!!
I initially joined this subreddit 632 days ago, but failed in quitting but from two months ago I have completely turned it around and can't stomach them anymore. 

I do not understand how, looking back now just how I could smoke it smells awful, tastes awful and made me stink!

It felt like it happened almost over night, but hey-ho.

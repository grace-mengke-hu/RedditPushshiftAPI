Just finished reading The Easy Way to Stop Smoking...I'm not sure if it clicked. Help?

As the title suggests, I just finished the book. I've been smoking a little over 3 years now and I really want to quit. BADLY and SOON. But I don't know if the book was quite the revelation I was hoping for, and now because of its advice I'm afraid to try other methods (NRT and other medicines). What made the book click for you? Do you think reading it again, possibly in a marathon session could help? I just want to be free of this.

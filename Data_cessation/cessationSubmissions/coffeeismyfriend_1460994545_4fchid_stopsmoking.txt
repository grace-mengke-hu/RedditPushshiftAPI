Day 1. Already stopped another addiction, so now time to stop smoking too

Hello all! I have decided to stop smoking cold turkey. I was a heavy drinker and quit drinking in December 2013. Best decision of my life. HOWEVER, I have been smoking A LOT since then. 

My family doctor has been trying to convince me to quit smoking for years. He said the first step of quitting smoking is realizing that you WANT TO / SHOULD quit. I’ve been stuck in that stage for years. 

So here I am! Kind of scared. Been smoking 20+ years. The last few years I’ve had 10-15 cigs a day. I practically chain smoke on my days off. ENOUGH! This is my first time trying to quit.
  
The internet says cold turkey is difficult / I will fail? Maybe I should try a nicotine replacement? Half my friends smoke e-cigarettes. I’m open to anything. But also I’m cheap as hell, so it just seems logical to try cold turkey since then I don’t have to buy anything. 

/r/stopdrinking has been my best friend since 2013...so I know how powerful and helpful the self-improvement subs are. Looking forward to reading posts here!

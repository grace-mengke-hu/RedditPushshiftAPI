Stop smoking by slowly breaking habits?

Hi!
My girlfriend smokes quite alot and she is the last one of her family who hasnt stopped smoking yet. Now since she is with me (occasional smoker) she really wants to cut down or quit smoking. Now our plan is to slowly cut down on habits and cigarettes until she doesnt smoke alot and then at some point maybe stop it completely. For example she used to always drink a coffe in the morning and have a cigarette, but now she stopped that habit and has her cigarette later when shes already out of the house which works pretty well and she says she also has less cravings during the day. Has anyone of you tried to smoke less this way or will the cravings always stay the same (like with Alcoholics) if you dont stop smoking 100% from one day to the other.

TL;DR: is it possible for a heavy smoker to become a occasional smoker by slowly breaking habits?

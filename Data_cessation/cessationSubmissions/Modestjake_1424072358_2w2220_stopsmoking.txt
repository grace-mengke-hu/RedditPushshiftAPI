Decided to quit today.

After a lot of thought, I decided to quit tonight. I'm so tired of feeling needlessly unhealthy. Any advice or support would be helpful. I had half a pack and I rinsed them all in the sink and crumpled the wet tobacco between my fingers. I'm nervous for tomorrow but excited for the obvious rewards coming in the future.

Quitting from today. New to this sub. Help me /r/stopsmoking.

I am 23y/o male from India. It is 12:46 AM IST.

I began smoking in 2010. That's the year I got into college. Got addicted. 20-21 a day.

It has come down to somewhere between 4 to 10 a day now. I have quit various times in these five years, sometimes I didn't smoke for seven days then a colleague/friend offers a smoke and boom goes my discipline, sometimes I didn't smoke for three months on a stretch.

I have noticed that my smoking usually increases when I'm outside, working or tensed.

Tonight I make a pledge to quit smoking for good. I tried Nicorette. That shit does not work. At least not for me. All I have is my mental strength. Let's see whether I have balls for real, well, hypothetically. 

Starting now, this very second, I QUIT SMOKING.

Goodbye everyone.

Quitting Reddit and deleting my account permanently because I believe I will make me more productive.
Thank you all in this community for being very supportive and good to each other.
I relapsed and started smoking again after 3 weeks quit but now I am 24 hourse nicotine free and plan on continuing trying. Never give up if you relapsed quit again until It sticks.
Cheers.

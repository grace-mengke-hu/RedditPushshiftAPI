So ready to do this! 8/10/2015 is my quit date

I know I can do this.  I quit for three years once.  I had a drinking problem and when I went into recovery everyone at the program and the meetings were smoking on breaks all the time and I picked it back up.  My ex wife is quitting at the same time, so we are doing this together.  Today my daughters and I are going to make her a big poster board for encouragement to quit.  I think she is going to have a harder time than I am.  I have been trying over the past few months to quit and I have already gone as long as a week so I know I can do it!  I am down to a pack lasting me 2-3 days.

Good luck everyone!!!

Quit yesterday and already having trouble sleeping.

Lurked this subreddit for a while because it was interesting, and this is my first time posting here. I'm serious about quitting this time. I've tried before. Made it a month at the longest. And I know I can hit one month again. But the amount I smoked a day has increased since then. I don't recall having this much trouble falling/staying asleep. Any tips or help? I work tonight, and getting a decent sleep would be wonderful.

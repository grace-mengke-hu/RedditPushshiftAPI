I did it! My strategy - from *needing* it to moderation

Hi! Here's how I knocked off a mild-moderate habit.

The use of psychedelics helped me appreciate my own health more and encouraged me to quit. Not to mention the aversion to the smell while under the influence. I also perform a certain type of vocals that cigarettes can affect the quality of. Plus, the lady friend whos been a good influence on the way I take care of myself didn't like tobacco smoking and she wanted me to quit. Thus I began the journey to quitting, or at least knocking regular use off.

For some, it may be the nicotine that has them hooked. For others, its just plain habit; it just feels "right" and one may experience anxiety without. For me it was a little of the nicotine, a lot of the habit. I consumed not more than 6 cigarettes on an average day. Not much, but it was still an unhealthy habit that had noticeable lingering negative effects.

I began by counting the number of cigarettes I consumed in a day, and under what circumstances. I noticed my intake increased when:

-Pissed off/stressed

-Under the influence

-Socializing

-Anxious

-Sad/depressed

-Bored

Boredom was a big one. I was smoking just because I was bored sometimes.

I noticed that when in distress smoking a cigarette can help me calm down and take a minute to tame the chaos in my head. I also like them when tripping balls/high/drunk. So I figured, why not save the damage for these occasions rather than for when I'm simply bored?

I began by setting a limit on the number of cigarettes I consumed per day - this limit was determined on how I was feeling the morning of. I struggle with mood issues so I have to account for them and set the limit on the same day rather than in advance. Giving myself a lot of wiggle room definitely helped committing to the idea of quitting easier. "Today my quota is 5 cigarettes." In order to reduce cravings I of course spaced these cigarettes out and tried to smoke them either practically (to relieve stress or calm anger; cool heads prevail) or as a reward ("I haven't smoked a single one up to this point, I think I deserve this one.") **The feeling of having successfully smoked fewer cigarettes than the quota I set for the day was highly rewarding.** No matter how many I had that day, there was typically one early in the day and one later in the day. These were the most important two times to prevent anxiety. As I found myself consistently smoking less than my quota for the day, I set the quota lower and lower. Eventually the effects of minor withdrawal passed and I was able to keep it to a max of 3 cigarettes per day. As more time passed, I smoked cigarettes only "as desired" in response to outside influences, as opposed to simply needing the nicotine fix to feel normal. Before I knew it, I forgot I even craved cigarettes in the first place. But they're still nice from time to time.

I was only smoking for 1-2 years. I genuinely enjoyed smoking - I loved the bold flavors of full-flavored cigarettes. Now the effects on my lungs/throat after smoking have become no longer worth it. A light cigarette can deliver a decent headbuzz again. Too many cigarettes make me sick, as opposed to not enough making me sick. 

Some encouragement helped too! Housemates would joke me for continuing to smoke even after I said I was quitting, but I suppose they're the kind that thinks going cold turkey is the only method of cessation... funny because one of them tried quitting cold turkey and failed after 3 days, of course after experiencing harsh mood swings, crying spells, and irritability. Her intake is much larger than mine.

The lady friend in particular gave me the most encouragement. Her gratitude had a great effect on my willpower to quit - "I can't disappoint her, I have to do this now, she would really appreciate it, and so would my body!" Now she doesn't have to kiss smoke mouth, and I can get kisses whenever I want xoxo. 

To be honest, it wasn't even all that hard. Typically the worst I experienced was irritability in the social context.

The main point here is positive reinforcement! Good luck & cheers folks.

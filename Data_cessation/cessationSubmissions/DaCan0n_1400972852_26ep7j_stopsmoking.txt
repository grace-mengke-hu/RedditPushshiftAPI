I need and want to stop my party smoking

First a small background story about myself and my habit:

I'm turning 28 this summer and had my first smoke when I was about 15 years old and continued my smoking habit about 2-3 years. I then stopped for about 2-3 years to start again for about 1 year, and then stop and now I have smoked more or less a couple of packs each month, mostly when I'm out partying which I tend to do a lot (I'm studying at a university).

I have had moments in my life when I have completely smoke-free but the craving is always there no matter what I do. Why I really want to quit now is because I have a not-so-close friend, but I still know him and used to hang with him, that only has a couple of days left to live due to a kind of cholangiocarcinoma (found it on Wiki, not really sure if that's the correct fucking cancer..). He has lived a healthy life with a lot of physical education etc, and the ironic part is that he is almost 3 years younger than me so I'm getting a bit worried about my health and life span..

So I'm looking for some kind of tip that can help me through the hard parts when I really crave a cigarette. I know there isn't a universal thing that I can do but I would love to hear someones story that might have been in the same situation I'm right now =)

Hope my wall-of-text hasn't been too hard to read, English is my second language =P

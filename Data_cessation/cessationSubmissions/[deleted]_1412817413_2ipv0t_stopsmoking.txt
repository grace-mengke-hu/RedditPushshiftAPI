I seem to have naturally cut down to smoking only part of the week, any advice on how to go from here?

I've been "trying to quit" for about 5 years now. About 10 months ago I managed to quit for 4 months using champix, which is the longest I've ever managed. Then I started slowly (just when I'm stressed, or drinking, or it's the morning and I'm grumpy... or when I'm breathing...) and worked my way up to a fulltime smoker again. 

Then I stopped for about a month, then I started again, then I tried champix again and quit for another two months, and I had a bad reaction to it, had to stop taking it and started smoking again. 

I was getting really frustrated, but then I started to notice I was regularly not smoking for a couple of days and it didn't bother me and it wasn't on purpose. I stopped buying cigarettes just because and started buying my partner smokes and having one just when I felt like it rather than out of habit but not actively trying not to smoke. This week for example I smoked about half a pack on Friday night, then did not smoke again until yesterday (Wednesday) when I had one, and now I'm sort of keen for one but not badly enough to walk down to the shops and get a pack.

I have a set of habits that I've taken on since I started trying to quit, one of my habits is to never drive to buy cigarettes, if I want them badly enough I'll walk, along with keeping my smokes on the opposite story of the house than I'm on, never smoking during work (I only do 4 hour shifts) and never smoking at uni (max 6 hours). 

I guess I've accidentally pushed my body into a routine of smoking on the weekends? We all know that's when the best smoking excuses are. I'm genuinely confused though and curious where to go from here. On one hand I don't want to push quitting and overthink it and have smoking on my mind all the time, and on the other hand I don't want to convince myself this is good enough or cycle back into smoking full time.

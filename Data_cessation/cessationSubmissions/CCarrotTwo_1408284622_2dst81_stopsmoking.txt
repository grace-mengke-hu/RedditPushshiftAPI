I'm picking the hardest time to quit.... help me

I'm 18 and have been smoking three packs a week for the past five months. I have tried quitting before and I couldn't last two days. Now I am working a tech theatre job at Cape Cod. Being around so many singers has reminded me how much I hated ciggarettes when I used to sing. Plus my allergies and asthma are triggered by dust, and anyone who has ever worked in a theatre can tell you that theatres hold a lot of dust. So I haven't been breathing well and I'm being constantly reminded how much one can do with proper breath, I need to quit. Going through the reasons this will be difficult seems like it will make it more difficult but here goes: I'm working 16 hr days with other smokers, on this job quitting or even cutting down isn't a thing people do, and I have almost no access to the internet so I don't know how much support I can get from this sub. 

But I'm about to start my first shift of the day and I'm feeling good. I left my ciggarettes at the house and I've got four hours of power tools and paint ahead of me. 

So help me out here. How do you think I can quit while working this hard? What should I do to make sure that I can stick to quitting?

i'm ticking towards 1yrs smoke free.. but withdrawal symptoms..

this could be my perception, hence want some opinion on this.

I quit almost 10 month back, but in general i observed i'm falling more sick post stopping smoking, is it just a withdraw symptoms?

physically i became more skinny and feels lack of stamina , opposite to what i expected. I don't have any health issues as per recent medical test i have gone through. 

can someone shed any light on this.. if this is withdraw symptom, how long shall i expect it to continue ?

thanks.

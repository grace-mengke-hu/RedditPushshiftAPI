The Illusion of Seeing a Smoker

Every one of us has experienced those moments where we see a smoker, whether in real life or in a movie, and we get jealous of them being able to smoke. A lot of times this can cause us to relapse.

Seeing a smoker is like seeing a man holding a knife when you're looking, but missing the part where he stabs himself in the leg repeatedly when you turn around.

You're only seeing the illusion of what a smoker is. You're not seeing how they feel inside. You're not seeing their thoughts about their addiction. You're not seeing their breathing. You're not seeing the disease and issues forming in their body. You're not seeing that they wish they weren't a smoker. 

Smoker's aren't able to smoke; they can't escape it.

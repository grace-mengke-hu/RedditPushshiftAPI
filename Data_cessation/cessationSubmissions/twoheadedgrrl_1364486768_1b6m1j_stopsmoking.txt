I never imagined it would be this hard...

Today is my 2nd cigarette-free day and for some reason I can't stop bawling. I feel like shit, I'm literally just sitting in my cubicle, sobbing as quiet as I can. Living in a big city is killing me even more because EVERYWHERE I walk I see somebody smoking, I get a whiff of second hand smoke or pass a convenience store where I know I can grab a pack. 

Yesterday I was just being a crazy bitch, today I'm just really depressed. I've been a heavy smoker for 6 years, which I've used as a crutch for anxiety/bipolar disorder/and as an appetite suppressant. I'm so stressed out right now literally the ONLY thing I want right now is a cigarette in my mouth. I know this is so fucking stupid but I literally never expected to react this way to quitting. 

Last night I after completing my full first day without a cigarette, I was looking in my jacket pockets for my chapstick when I find a haggard Belmont pack with a *single* cigarette. Just one fucking cigarette. At midnight. What the fuck kind of cruel joke was that? After staring at it for probably 5 minutes, I threw it out. Fuck, was that hard.

Any tips for a fresh quitter? :( I'm starting to lose hope already....

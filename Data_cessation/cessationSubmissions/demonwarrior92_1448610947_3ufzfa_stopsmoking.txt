Acne and Dreams

A bit of background, I have been smoke free for 20 days now and have a few pimples as a result. I have been taking nicorette lozenges and I'm wondering weather this from the nicorette or the not smoking itself. Also every night I have vivid dreams about smoking in addition to bad nightmares. Has anyone else had this experience with nicorette?

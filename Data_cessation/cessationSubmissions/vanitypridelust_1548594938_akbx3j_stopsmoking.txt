How long do the insane dreams last?

I never realized how little I was dreaming until I got sober off of everything, but stopping smoking in particular launched all my dreams into overdrive.

Every night for the past three weeks I have had dreams so vivid it's like I'm living in them. Some of them are kinda disturbing, some are kinda fun, but they're sort of exhausting to experience. I wake up feeling discombobulated and like my brain has been doing gymnastics. I kinda miss falling asleep and then just having it be morning.

From what I've read I understand it's the result of my brain repairing connections and learning to deal with having real serotonin again and lots of oxygen and the whole mess basically indicates healing. 

But seriously when does it balance out?

Feeling so good

Tonight at midnight Eastern Standard time will mark 1 month I have been nicotine free. I quit cold turkey after having cut down to four cigarettes a day. I smoked for ten years, from age 20 til shortly after turning 30. I work at a convenience store, where I work alone, feel sometimes intense stress, and am constantly surrounded by all forms of tobacco. I always planned on quitting smoking at some point, but never genuinely thought I could. But hey, here I am, a non-smoker!

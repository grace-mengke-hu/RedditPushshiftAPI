Trying to help my girlfriend by getting her to quit

Please please help. She tried to stop about a week ago by Vaping. She used to smoke a pack a day. The thing is that she smoked a few and she lied about it. She admitted to lying about it last night after I asked her. Look she really needs help but at the same time I don't really trust her anymore (only with quitting). I'm going on leave for a week to spend time with her (I see her every day it's not like I'm deployed). This week has been super stressful for her because of her best friends wedding and everything is cluster Fuck. Is it normal for people to smoke 1 a day briefly after they try to smoke? Please give me ideas because I love her and I want what's best for her.

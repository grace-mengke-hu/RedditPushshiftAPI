I'm seriously having doubts about my quit...

I've been on the patch and took it off three days ago. The feeling of prolonging my nicotine addiction felt dumb. I know I'm just detoxing from nicotine but damn I fucking want a cigarette. My brother just came by and he smokes. My friend just went outside and smoked one. AHHHHHHHHHHH. Will this get any easier or am I just not doing it right what the fuck. I can't concentrate for more than 30 minutes without thinking of a cigarette.

Beware of vapes/e-cigs

I was addicted to cigarettes it took a lot of attempts to quit. The longest I “quit” was since February because I used the juul the whole time. I have been chain vaping with the juul everywhere from when I get up to when I go to sleep, going through 1-2 pods a day, I never even smoked the equivalent of that in cigarettes so I am getting nicotine overload. I stopped smoking the juul today and now I’m struggling with another addiction I’m trying to quit. Also I’m still thinking about cigs. Do yourself a favour don’t even bother with e-cigarettes unless you really need to, just adds another bad addiction to your life that is hard to quit.

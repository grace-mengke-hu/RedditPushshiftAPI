New quit yesterday

Hey y'all!  As the post states, I quit smoking yesterday at midnight so it's day 2 and oh glorious me I CAN'T SLEEP!  Of course I know, insomnia normal.  I've tried to quit I don't know how many times, hoping someone out there knows what I am going through.

I stay at home, don't work which isn't hard.  I fill my day taking my husband to work, cleaning house, working out, taking care of my mother, and well to boot dealing with bipolar disorder. All of this on top of quitting and I know no excuses, so I've been hitting the gym more and using the nicotine patch.

Otherwise, as you can tell from my username, I live in the devils playground.  It's hot, sweaty, boiling, roasting, I hate summer Kansas! I know attitude is everything right towards quitting?  Who can honestly have a good attitude when it's a heat index of 110 and you have to peel yourself out of your car? lol

Nite everyone, will respond to posts asap!

Day one

Just finished rereading easy way. These cravings are mild as fuck, especially when compared to nofap. The only thing is the weird compulsion where you're on autopilot and you start going for a smoke and need to stop it. Hopefully that doesn't last more than a month or so, because that might get annoying quick.

I probably won't update this but if you comment I'll reply

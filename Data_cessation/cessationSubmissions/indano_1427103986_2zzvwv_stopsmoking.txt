60 days! Wow!

I just wanted to thank all of the encouraging people in this sub. You guys are great. I have visited daily for the last two months and it has been very helpful to read all the positive comments about reasons behind quitting, how to detect triggers, how to cope with craves and tonnes of perspective. Life is short, let's be as a healthy as we can and let's not smoke today!  Cheers everyone. 

PS - the first week was tough. It became progressively easier but tough again at about 45 days! Now I don't think about it as much. I think about it when having coffee occasionally. Best decision ever. I have noticed a marked improvement in my self-confidence since quitting.

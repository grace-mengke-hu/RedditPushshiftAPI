Back on track!

Starting my new job kind of messed me up because I was having trouble getting back into the swing of things after being out of work for so long, but now I'm back on track! I have adult onset asthma, so I can't continue to smoke or my symptoms will only get worse and I don't want it to get so bad that I can't work. I'm not going to let cigarettes take another job away from me and I'm not going to let them mess with my health anymore. I just have to keep reminding myself that it's not worth it and I think that's good advice for anyone trying to quit. Just keep reminding yourself that it's not worth the money/health problems/whatever.

Did anybody else get this feeling?

Okay, so, after a few false starts I'm ready to quit again. I smoked a couple this morning, and I've spent the rest of the time reading this sub...But it seems like now that I've decided to quit, the urge to smoke is much greater than it would've been had I not decided that. Like, my brain knows I'm going to quit, so it's trying to throw as big a stumbling block as it can. It's really getting me down.

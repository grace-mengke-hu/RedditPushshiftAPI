3 months today

I can't believe it's gone by so quickly. Really proud to say I feel like a non-smoker more and more and less of an ex-smoker. I now see smoking as something I no longer like or care to do.
The triggers for smoking have still been there (stress mostly) but I'm just learning to cope better and I understand now that the answer is not and was never in a pack of 20.

Strangely enough I haven't thrown away my inhaler or refills, despite not touching/using them. It sits in my bag and I see it occassionally. Maybe so I don't become comfortable. I don't know.

Tonight, I feel great!

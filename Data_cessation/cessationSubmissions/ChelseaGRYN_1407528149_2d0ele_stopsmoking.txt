25 days without a death stick and I noticed something weird.

Smoking! How have I never noticed before.

So I'm sitting outside my work on the picnic table just getting some fresh air, and I notice some smokers come out to the smoking area (where I used to smoke). As I'm watching them my brain begins to fathom just how absolutely fucking weird smoking is. Think about it..
First you put some dried out poisonous plant wrapped in paper to your lips and set it on fire. Then you inhale the burnt particulates that the filter doesn't filter. You hold them in for a sec so the molecules enter into your bloodstream. You do this repeatedly. Then after 5 minutes you flick the butt in a special bucket made for them (smokers pot) so you don't litter. then you go back to work smelling like absolute shit. You do this in ritualistic intervals throughout the day and repeat it every day! The weird part about this....you don't think any of it is abnormal or weird!!!       

I think for me the ritual of smoking has been the hardest part. after lunch, while driving etc. etc. I find myself feeling sorry for other smokers but don't say anything to them, encouraging them to quit, unless they ask. Do you guys feel the same for smokers? Or are you indifferent? I've also just now started coughing up stuff...wasn't that supposed to happen in the first week?

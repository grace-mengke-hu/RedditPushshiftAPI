First time posting here, not my first time quitting, but looking for some help and advice...

Ok, so, I started smoking cigarettes when I was 17...it was after I learned that they make you feel awesome after smoking a little weed, but once I quit smoking weed, I couldn't quite smoking cigarettes....I smoked them until I was 23, and that's when I learned about e-cigarettes.

After I started smoking e-cigarettes, I only smoked regular cigarettes like 3 other times, and only because I was out of liquid and it was still a new thing and you could only buy it online at the time.

But I know the e-cigarettes still have nicotine, and I've tried to quit, but I never get more than a week before I give in and buy more...I mean I'm glad I was able to quit real cigarettes, I feel disgusted just being around them now, but now I'm addicted to e-cigarettes and they're even harder to quit since they taste so damn good with all the different flavors.....

And I know they sell nicotine free ones, I tried them, and i couldn't stop because I couldn't get the fix; ended up going through a full tank in one day...

I'm currently trying to quit for real this time, I really need to, and it's been 4 days now. And I am really hurting. 7 days ago I tried to quit, but gave in and bought a disposable ecig. It ran out after 2 days. For the last 4 days, I've been sucking on an empty disposable ecig just for the feeling, even though I'm getting nothing out of it...is this a good way to quit, or should I throw this thing away? 

When I get seriously tempted to buy more, I just suck this empty one and it calms me down, but I don't wanna rely on this forever...I've already thrown out my pricey kits that I used for vaping, so my only temptation left is buying disposables or buying another $150 kit, and I don't want either...

Has anyone been in this situation before that can offer some advice? I really need some help and I don't know where else to turn...

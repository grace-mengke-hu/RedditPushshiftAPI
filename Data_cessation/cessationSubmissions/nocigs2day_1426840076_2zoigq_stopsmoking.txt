Dare I say things seem to be better today?

11 Days in and things seem to be getting better, slept pretty well last night, dont feel like I have a cold today, nothing has pissed me off yet.
I know I still have a long way to go but just wanted to state that today has started much better.
Must be the eclipse!, OoooOoooO

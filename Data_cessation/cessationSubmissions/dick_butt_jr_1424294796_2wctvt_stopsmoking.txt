So I've decided to quit.

I've been smoking since I was 16 years old. I'm a college student and now 21, and for roughly the past 3 years, I've wanted to quit. I just got a new job where I'll have to move and have a lot more responsibility. I think it'd be a good idea to get a head start before stress gets worse. Any tips on stopping for good? I've tried and tried in the past but I always break.

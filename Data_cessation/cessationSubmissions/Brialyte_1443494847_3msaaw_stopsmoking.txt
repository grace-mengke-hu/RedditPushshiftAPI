Day 12

I haven't lit or smoked a cigarette in 12 days. Every single night I have major cravings and what I do to deal with them is I step outside with a cigarette (same one since day 1). But I don't light it. I sit there and do some deep breaths, enjoy looking at Facebook and Instagram as I always would do when I smoked, and hold the unlit cigarette As if I am smoking it. Maybe going through the motions makes it easier since I quit cold turkey. Either way, I haven't lit/smoked a cigarette in 12 days and I feel really good!! Keep fighting the good fight, friends

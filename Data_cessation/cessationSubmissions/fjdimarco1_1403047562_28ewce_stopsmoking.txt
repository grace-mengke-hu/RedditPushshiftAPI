I'm so done with having an addictive personality!

I get addicted so easily to everything. People, cigarettes, food, feelings, places. If I find something I like I just have to keep it, no matter what it costs me. 
I've gone two weeks without smoking and I honestly feel great about it. My singing is better, my wallet is better, it's very good. That's not to say I don't miss it, I do. I miss coming out of the tube station and grabbing my cigs and lighter for the walk, I miss having something to do with my hands and mouth. 
Do these things ever go away or will I be fighting them forever?

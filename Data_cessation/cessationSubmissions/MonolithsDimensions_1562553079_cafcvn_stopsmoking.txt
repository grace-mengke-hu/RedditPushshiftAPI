Tomorrow’s the first day of a new life

Unfortunately I waited too long. A month ago I learned I have bullae in my lungs and likely have COPD or emphysema. I’m 51, and started when I was a teenager.  I go for a lung function test in 3 weeks. When I initially found out I did stop but slowly made exceptions etc etc. Thankfully someone here shared the Allan Carr book and that’s made all the difference .  I’m trying not to dwell on the fact that I’ve come so close and failed in the past .  I’m determined to make the best of my health moving forward and get my lungs as strong and clean as possible. I am scared, because I’ve clearly badly damaged myself but I can’t dwell on that as it makes walking away from this stupid addiction worse.  Being angry at myself doesn’t help either.   

I’ve just told my 21 year old son (who’s just returning from a semester off in France) and now I’m pretty emotional. He’s been wanting me to quit since forever, I’m pretty heartbroken having laid this on him.  My family and some friends know , but I haven’t told my Mom , who has COPD for the same reasons and is on oxygen all the time. She has enough to deal with.  On the positive end of things my heart / blood pressure are good and my diet / weight are ok.

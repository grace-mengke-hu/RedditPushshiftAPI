I made it through work today!!

I quit smoking on Friday last week. I work as a cook and generally do prep at night but work the line on Sundays. We were closed last Sunday so today was the true test of will but I made it!!


 The fact that I came down with quitters flu yesterday probably helped as I never smoke when I'm sick. That being said I'll probably use this hellish retribution of sore throat, runny nose, sore muscles and exhaustion as motivation to never touch the cancer sticks again... Good luck everyone, we got this!

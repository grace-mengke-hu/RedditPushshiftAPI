I missed my year by a day. That's how easy it is to forget you used to be a slave.

Holy shit, 366! I don't even think much about it anymore. And I drink still. Starting a new job tomorrow, anxiety's running high, but smoking is not the first thing I think of to solve this. So, those of you just starting, keep in mind... it really does get better.

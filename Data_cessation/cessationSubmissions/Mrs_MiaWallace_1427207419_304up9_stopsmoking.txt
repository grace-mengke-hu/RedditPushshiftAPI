Anyone else notice a difference in dreams after quitting?

I haven't had a cigarette in 2 weeks now (yay!) and I've noticed ever since then, I've either had really weird dreams or dreams where I am smoking and then wake up relieved that I didn't actually smoke. It's also weird that I didn't have dreams about myself smoking when I was a smoker.

Is this just due to sleeping better without cigarettes? Did something similar happen to anyone else?

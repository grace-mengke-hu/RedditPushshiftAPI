Parents of Reddit: How did you Quit?

I'm a stay at home mom with a 4 month old and 16 month old. I do want to quit, I just don't know the best way..I don't want the withdrawals to make me bitchy toward my kids..its not their fault Mommy is going temporarily insane. Husband smokes too..and before its suggested, we found out the hard way we are NOT built to quit at the same time.

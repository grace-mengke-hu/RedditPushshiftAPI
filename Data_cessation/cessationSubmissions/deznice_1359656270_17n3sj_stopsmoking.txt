Quit smoking 2 nights ago

and I am tweaking for some nicotine. I can feel the need for it under my skin..... GODDAMNIT. /endrant. Sorry keeping it from family and friends b/c everytime I "quit" and tell people, I go back to smoking. Life works best for me if I keep some positive things a secret as I work through them.... BUT DAMN I AM jonesing.... Going for a walk. FU PARLIAMENTS YOU CAN SUCK MY D***

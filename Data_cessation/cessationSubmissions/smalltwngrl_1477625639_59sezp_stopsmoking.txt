Quit 48 Hours Ago

I feel like one of those moms who says thier baby is 74 months old. 

I started smoking when I was 17 and I'm now 26. I am starting a new job, at a smoke free campus, and wanting to have weight loss surgery next year so I figured now's the perfect time to save some money and put them down. Tonight was the worst cravings so far. My SO and I were watching TV, not even talking to each other, and I was so irritated I said "I am so freaking mad at you right now and I don't know why." He thought this was just hilarious. He quit dipping 14 days ago and has taken it like a damn champ. The craving passed soon after and I'm sure the next ones will too. Keep up the fight, peeps! WE CAN DO THIS!

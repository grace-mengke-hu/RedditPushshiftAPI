I'm dying.

33 days in and the fucking cravings are getting worse. I am nearing my limit. 

Let's start off with some exposition. I started smoking in the summer of 2016 at *cough* 23 because, indeed, I am retarded. Like who tf starts smoking at 23, so dumb. I had a panic attack and wowie zowie, these cancer sticks really did the trick. Since then I've been a regular light user. I smoked every day but I never went past 5 or 6 cigarettes regularly. I have tried to quit numerous times in the past but I never succeed. It feels like my head is burning with exasperation and I'm super pissed off at everything. I found quitting cold turkey pretty much impossible while working full time. I can't afford to lose my shit at work. So I tried nicotine patches.

They started me with the 21mg patch for some dumb, uneducated reason. No shit it was too strong for me, I was a quarter pack a day smoker. Then they gave me 14mg patches. These were great. I still had cravings to stick shit in my mouth but they weren't overpowering. At the least, I was able to keep my cool throughout the day. Here comes the 7mg patch. Noticeable difference. Now I am on no patch and realize that the physical hold Nicotine has on you is infinitesimal compared to the psychological hold. It doesn't matter if you have no nicotine in your body. You WANT it ALL THE TIME.

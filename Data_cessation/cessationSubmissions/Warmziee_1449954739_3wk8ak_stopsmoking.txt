How do you handle the urge to smoke when drinking alkohol?

I have not touched anything with nicotine for around 2 years now but every time I drink I feel the urge to smoke to the extent that I stay at home instead of having fun with friends.  
  
How do you handle the alkohol/nicotine connection after you quit?

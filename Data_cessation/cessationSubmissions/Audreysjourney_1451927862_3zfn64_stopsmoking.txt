No more excuses

Hi all. I've tried to stop smoking on and off for years. Thought I had done it when I swapped to vaping for nearly 2 years. Initially I felt the benefits but about a year and a half on the vape I had a constant cough and started to feel breathless. I had a chest infection in October and quite literally thought my lungs were going to collapse. Got inhalers, antibiotics, steroids and sent for breathing tests. Results COPD. Went for patches and thought "I'll just cut down" thought I was doing ok then major exasperation and could hardly breath again. Broke down in doctors and she said if I stop smoking I would get so much better. The thought of going through this every other month was too much. I promised myself that day I will never smoke again and no matter how bad a craving may be it will never be as bad as gasping for breath just walking up the stairs. Thought I would post this to encourage others who have found it hard to commit to stopping not to wait till your health is affected. I am hopeful the future will be brighter. I'm worth more than wasting my life and health through smoking.ðŸ˜€

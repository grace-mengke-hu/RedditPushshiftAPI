Back to day 1 but I'm forgiving myself this one

So yesterday I was on day 13 of cold turkey, I was kinda crazy but I was doing it. Then my much beloved, sunshiny little ten year old cat fell suddenly Ill. She was admitted to hospital with sudden kidney failure and I was basically told to prepare myself for putting her to sleep today. I was beside myself with misery. Eventually, while waiting for the call from the vet and trying to keep it together at work, I crumbled and bought cigarettes. I had 5 or so in about 5 hours and they were disgusting and I feel thoroughly sick. Then I got the call from the vet-turns out she is defying all expectations and has improved enormously and will probably be okay! I was able to throw out the cigarettes. I'm not going to beat myself up for this. I think it's okay that I couldn't cope with the idea of losing my best mate without cigarettes after only 13 days without them. I'm starting again from now. As long as my other cat doesn't suffer organ failure in the next two weeks I'll probably make it this time. There's no real moral to this, I Just wanted to share. Ps sorry for formatting, on mobile.

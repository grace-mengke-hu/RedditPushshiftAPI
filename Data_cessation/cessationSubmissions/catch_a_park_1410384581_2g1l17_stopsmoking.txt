Still smoking ...

... and I must quit. I know I must. I am having a little trouble tho. It's not easy. I have cut down by tearing my cigarettes my im half and cutting down the number of smokes per day but I feel like I need to take the final step.

I have been smoking for 15 years, starting gradually in high school and was up to a pack per day until recently when I started cutting down.

If anybody has any helpful advice or can share their experience, that would be great! I'd like to get some idea of what I'm in for.

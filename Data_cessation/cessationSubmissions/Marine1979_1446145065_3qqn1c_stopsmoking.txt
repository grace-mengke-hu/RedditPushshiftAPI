I made it 4 weeks

This forth week has been to toughest one for me because of some shitty days at work and yesterday was one in which I would have  smoked extra cigarettes because of the extra stress. But I keep telling my self smoking is not going to relieve the stress. To hell those little white heroin sticks they lie to you. Today is my day off and I feel great, am breathing easier my energy is through the roof.

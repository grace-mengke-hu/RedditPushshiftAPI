Day 1 of weaning off nicotine. Vaping or smoking, it's all bad.

I don't remember when I first started smoking, probably 15-16. I did it on and off all after that. I was actually completely nicotine free for a year and a half, until my \*wonderful\* influence of a friend introduced me to vaping. I learned vaping is even harder to quit than cigarettes, because you can just keep doing it, and you don't realize how much you're getting. That was December of 2015 (I remember because I bought my E-Cig on the day I saw Force Awakens). I recently decided to quit vaping with cigarettes, I only intended on doing it a few days, maybe a couple of weeks at most - That was 4 months ago. The first few days, I had reality hit me how much I was vaping. Because cigarettes taste like ass, and vaping you can do indoors, subconsciously I kept going back to the area in my house where I'd normally kept my E-Cig. I did it A LOT.  I also had a bunch of old vapor juice bottles I originally kept to use for mixing paints and stuff. Ultimately I never used them, and they just sat there. I know I had bought more than the ones I had, but there was still a good amount of them. While throwing them away, I kept an estimated tally of how much I spent.

The grand total came out to be $1,156.

I know I spent more than that, as I threw most of them away. I didn't even include the 3 other used bottles I had in my room, which I used for ink wash. Including those, it would have made the total roughly $1,237. But that being said, some of those bottles dated back to 2015/2016.

I am mostly just writing this as a way to keep my hands and mind busy, as the withdrawals suuuuuuuuck. But hopefully this was enlightening to at least some of you.

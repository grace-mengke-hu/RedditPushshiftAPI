#EX-SMOKER: Can I run 5K in a marathon in 6 weeks?

One of my biggest motivators for quitting smoking is running a marathon. I realize it seems too ambitious at first but I am ready to train hard. The upcoming marathon is in October and I want to be able to run a 5K. I have started jogging every day for about a week now but I simply can't go any longer than 1-2 minutes without losing my breath.  
Are there any ex-smokers who have successfully adopted a healthy lifestyle and might have specific advice for beginners? Thanks!

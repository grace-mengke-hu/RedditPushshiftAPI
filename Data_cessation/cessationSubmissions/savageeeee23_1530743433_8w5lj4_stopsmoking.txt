Addicted

I am 18 years old and i have been smoking for 2 years now. I really want to quit but when i think about that a “voice” in my head keeps me telling that what are you going to do without smoking a cigarette in certain situations for example in school breaks,hanging out with mu friends or just sipping on a cup of coffee for mu self. Anyone has experienced that when they thinked about quiting?

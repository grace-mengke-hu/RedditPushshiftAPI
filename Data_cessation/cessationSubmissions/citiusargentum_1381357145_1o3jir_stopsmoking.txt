How do I avoid a relapse??

Its been nearly 3 weeks and suddenly I am getting this real strong craving for a smoke. I am not able to concentrate on work, there's this general feeling of boredom, apathy and lack of interest all rolled into one. The work is piling up and all I can think of is going to the corner store to pick up a pack.

there was this scene in friends when chandler is explaining how to smoke to Joey as " don't think of it as a cig, think of it as something that's missing all this while"

any inputs would be truly appreciated.

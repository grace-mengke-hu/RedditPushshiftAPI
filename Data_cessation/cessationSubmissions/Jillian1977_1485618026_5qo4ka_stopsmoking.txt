Best stop smoking info

I read the other day that when you've quit smoking and your body is uncomfortable, know that this is your body healing itself. 

That hit home for me to help get through cravings. Kind of like I'm sick, but eventually I will heal and feel better. 

Funny videos are also my best solution to get through a craving. Along with some hot gum (peppermint or cinnamon). 

Hope this helps someone!

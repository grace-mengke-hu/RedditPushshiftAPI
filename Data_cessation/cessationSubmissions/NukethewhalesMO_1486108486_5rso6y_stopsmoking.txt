I'm quitting starting today and I need some tips.

Two days ago I told myself I'd quit when I finished a fresh pack of cigarettes that I hope will be my last. I smoked the last one earlier tonight and I intend to follow through with quitting cold turkey. I thought about switching to a vape, but I don't really want to taper the addiction; I want to end it since I have a fairly addictive personality.

I won't lie, I picked a bad time to quit, the stress in my life is piling up and I'm currently living with my brother who is also a smoker and has no desire to quit. I don't want that to deter me though; I feel like shit all the time, smell like shit from dawn to dusk and due to an inherited predisposition for heart disease and high blood pressure, I'm basically a ticking time bomb of healthcare catastrophes even without cigarettes.

I'm just looking for ideas to help me stay sane when I'm at the peak of withdrawal a day or two from now.

Day 5: 24 yr smoker, cold turkey

Really starting to think i have smoking licked. Im going to stop chronicling my experience every day unless i have a relapse or things dont continually get easier. It is getting easier. If youre still smoking while you read this, Im going to reiterate what others have said. All you have to do is get through the first 2 or 3 days cold turkey. Youll still think about it a lot but the cravings are very manageable if you stop to think and rationalize for a second.

I still think this forum is an excellent resource for thise trying to quit. I will continue to read daily, but i'll post agai. At the 2 week mark....which is only 9 days away!!!

Good luck taking back and extending your lives, friends.

One week quit! Takes a whopper illness to finish it.

Smoked last cigarette last Saturday because it felt like it was burning through my lungs.  Two days later I was admitted into the hospital with pneumonia.  I had no cough or other symptoms.  After three nights in the hospital which was scary for me (I'm only 41).  I had a roommate that was 48 that was a smoker that now had extreme asthma.  It was kind of a glimpse into my future....keep smoking maybe I could end up with asthma.  We all know all the other terrible things smoking causes too.

I'm almost glad I got this pneumonia to wake me up to the realization of what I have been doing to my lungs before I damage them any further.

I have quit smoking 15 times.  I always went back because I thought that it was just so enjoyable.  Now I feel like I know the truth about what those damn things have been doing to me.  Its so easy to think those things will never happen to me.  If your still a smoker I wish you luck in quitting before you get as sick as I did.

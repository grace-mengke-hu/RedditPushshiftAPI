Hello, i recently quit cold turkey. 4 days now

So i smoked since i was 13 i am now 28, i've always had this way of getting addicted to stuff, and being able to quit it cold turkey without real problem at all. When i was younger i use to smoke weed everyday around maybe 4-5 grams a day, one day i just didn't feel like it was doing anything for me anymore so i quit after maybe 2-3 years of it, when i turned 18 i was introduced to alcohol which i was hitting pretty hard as well i ended up drinking maybe 3-4 days at a time in a week for maybe 2 years. Until one night i just didn't feel like going out and drinking with the same people over and over everytime.

So this past weekend i was sitting in my room and i had my last smoke in my last pack for the night, i meant to just go buy another carton of cigs the next day, usually my smoking would varies from month to month sometimes i would smoke half a pack a day other times it would be 2-3  day one time i was on 1 cig a day for a couple months. anyways i digress, as i was getting ready to go buy smokes for the month i seen a post on facebook from one of my friends saying how hard it is to quit smoking and other vices, so i replied about how i quit everything except smoking, then she asked me how i quit everything, my answer was simple i just didn't drink or smoke weed simple as that, she didn't believe me, so i told her i would quit smoking like she was trying, she told me to try.

Day 1: no really cravings just one time at night when i seen people smoking outside a store where i live lasted about 4-5mins not a big deal

Day 2:  nothing really to report, had some kind of dr pepper gum so that got me throught the day without much problem 

Day 3: i generally didn't notice since it was tv show night i found that plus with a snow storm going on i was kind of glad i didnt have to go outside to smoke.

Day 4: today, i noticed i didn't really have any cravings the past couple days and wondered if i should just quit (this was just to see if i could go a week without smokes) we'll see how i feel tomorrow.

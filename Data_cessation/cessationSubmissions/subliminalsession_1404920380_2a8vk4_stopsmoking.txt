a month today (help)

it doesn't feel like it's been a month but today marks a month since i quit cold turkey ... today is a really difficult day for me, because i keep wanting to smoke loads. i find that after three weeks, cravings generally GO. but then you have good days and bad days. i didn't think about cigarettes at all yesterday but then i've had quite a few shit things happen to me today and all i can think about is how good a cigarette would feel. i miss smoking. i hate staying inside when all my friends go out for a smoke. i hate cuddling up to my s/o when he smells like smoke. i hate not having a crux when i'm stressed and need something to fix it. i hate having to be in constant control of myself on nights out, during stressful moments, and having to decline cigarettes on an almost daily basis from people who forget/don't know i've quit. lord help me is there a simple way through this???!

I'm starting to cave in...

Well, it's been slightly more than 24 hrs. since my last cigarette. I know I'll be going out for drinks tonight and I am already telling myself to go buy a pack to "just get you through tonight".  Any suggestions to help get someone through a night out without a cigarette?

Quit last week.

So yeah, i tried to quit several times, i'm 22... And last month I had nose surgery and after that I just noticed how awful they smell... 
So... I've felt really sick at work last Thursday, went home, had like 13 cigs in pack , threw them away, and went to sleep! 
So hopefully this time will be for good!

Anyone know how i can quit without wanting to kill myself while working and getting bored?

So i'm just asking...i tried this like 3 times aldready and at work i just want to either kill myself or someone else if they piss me off while trying to quit at work. I suffer from deep depression and anxiety and all other kinds of bullshit and i think that i just solve all my problems with smoking. I just want it over with...it's controlling me.

I quit for 2 years around 3 years ago and started again last year out of stupidity...now i can't remember how i did it. I just know i wans't working and i could afford just staying in and hurting for a week or so. Now i don't have that luxury to stay home and just ride that pain...i have to work and i can't afford to be angry or whatever because noone will understand me.

Anyone got any tips?

Is zero-nicotine, flavored e-cigarettes safe?

Hello Reddit, For the past 15 years, I used to smoke 10-15 cigarettes a day. I have never tried e-cigarette. Today is my 15th day without cigarette. I have intense cravings today, and I was wondering whether I can go for an e-cigarette with zero-nicotine, flavored e-liquid. Is it safe? Thanks in advance for the answers. :)

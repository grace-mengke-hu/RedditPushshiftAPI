Coughing stuff up...? gross description inside

Sitting at work, and I suddenly feel the urge to cough, it's the closest to having a hairball that I can imagine. I hacked into a tissue and it looked like....pesto sauce. kinda. Should I be concerned? I've read that it's normal to develop a cough after quitting, but I'm not sure if it's normal to produce...green slime.

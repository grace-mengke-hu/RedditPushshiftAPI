Traveling for the first time since I quit / need a reminder of why I'm even doing this

I'm in a new city and it's lovely out and instead of enjoying it I'm super depressed because I can't have a cigarette. It feels like I'll never enjoy anything as much again because I quit. I'm inclined to assume everything will feel this way forever. I know that's not the case, and what's more, I know that when I was smoking I was depressed tooâ€”maybe even more so. I'm a depressive person in general, as so many of us are on here. But I need a reminder of why the fuck I'm making things hard on myself when it feels like everything sucks no matter what and depression is the baseline anyway. Why take something that gave me a tiny punctuation mark of enjoyment and "control" away from myself?

My urges start weeks/months after quitting cold-turkey

I consider myself a social smoker. On a weekend with my buddies, I smoke when I have a drink in my hand, which is to say about 6 - 8 cigs on any given weekend night. I might even do 1 or 2 cigs on a weekday, usually after dinner. I've done this for about 10 years now, sometimes less, sometimes more, but never like a pack a day or anything like that. 

When it comes to quitting, I've quit a few times. One time for 6 months straight, most times for about 4 - 12 weeks. Contrary to what most people say and have written here, I have no problem going cold-turkey for the first few days or even a couple of weeks. I usually stop after I've smoked too much (like the Pearl Jam concert I was at this Tuesday) and the night that followed. So I quit cold-turkey after that since this Wed and have had no urges so far. But my problem is always the few weeks after I've quit; that's when I feel like I need to have a smoke and it usually starts with one that I bum off a buddy and before I know it, I'm buying a pack. 

Does anyone have this problem? Gum, patches, etc. all work completely opposite to what I go through, so I don't want to try those. Why do I keep going back to this after such a long period of non-smoking?

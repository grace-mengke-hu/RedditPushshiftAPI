Quit on Tuesday, 350km bicycle in 4 days but

in the evenings it still feels like hell. Missing it so much every night, can't sleep until 3 or 4 o clock, because there is simply nothing which can replace the big hole in my body which wants to SMOKE. 

I thought with cycling like hell (tent and sleep mat included), i will just loose the demand of smoking while keeping blood pressure high all day. It works for the day, muscles, lungs and everything else in my body demands air and enjoying nonsmoke. So it is basically working, i managed to kill 4 days now without cigarette. But especially the feeling on the evening / night = sitting under the summer sky full of stars and wait until sleep comes, i would give so much to enjoy the taste of a nice self rolled cigarette. It's not getting away, it feels even stronger every night. Starting to think that somebody which knows how good it feels to smoke self rolled tobacco will never stop to miss it

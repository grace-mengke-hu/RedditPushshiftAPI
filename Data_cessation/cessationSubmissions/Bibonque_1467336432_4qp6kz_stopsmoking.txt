Quit again Sunday

I've been smoking since last September and decided to quit again. Longest I went was 3 weeks in April. Haven't bought any all week but I bummed 2 yesterday at my old job where this all started. Wish I hadn't but I think I'll be fine. Just venting cause I really want one right now haha. Anybody else quit after less than a year? How tough was it?

Cautionary Tale

Don't be like me.   I had quit for 1 year and 4 months.    Right before Christmas I went out with some friends, had more to drink than usual and thought I had smoking beat and I could just have a few and go back to not smoking again.   After all, I have a coworker like that.  He can just have one here and there and has never gotten hooked.   
WRONG. 
 A few turned into a pack, just so I could have a few more naturally, and that turned into another pack and another.    I am back up to smoking half a pack a day.   I tried to make yesterday my quit day, but I rationalized buying another pack today.     For the love of God, if you get this beat don't ever think you play with fire again and not get burned.    This sucks.    Resetting my quit app from 1 year and 4 months to zero was the worst.    It just isn't worth it.   Maybe there's some people out there that can do it, but I have learned hard way I'm not one of those people.      For me at least, I know now that I can never let my guard down again.  Now I'm stuck in the familiar cycle of setting and breaking quit deadlines.   Destroying cigarettes only to go back to the store to buy more, etc.

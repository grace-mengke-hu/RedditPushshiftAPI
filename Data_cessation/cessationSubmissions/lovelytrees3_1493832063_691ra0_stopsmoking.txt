Back to Day 1.

A lot has happened since my last go at quitting. . . Grandma was just diagnosed with Stage 3 lung cancer and we don't know how long she has. You think that'd be enough to get me to quit, but addiction is funny like that.

The 15 days I was successfully quit were the happiest 15 days I have felt since I was a child. I was singing, dancing, breathing, smelling everything, smiling, going to the gym. . . then sadness and depression shoved me off course. How did this happen? How was I so resigned to slipping back into the life of feeling dirty, coughing, smelling bad, unable to breathe, lethargic, on edge, shaky, smoking?

Am I assigning blame for my unhappiness to a habit? Probably.
Is that a way of dodging accountability? Definitely.
Perhaps it makes it easier to disappoint people when you can just blame your addiction.

Pardon me for rambling on. 
Thank you to everyone who encouraged me before, and thank you in advance for encouraging me now. You are all such a wonderfully inspiring group (even the user who told me that I hadn't accomplished anything great after 5 days!).

Have a wonderful rest of your day.

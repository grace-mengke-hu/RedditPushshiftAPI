Can you quit smoking by not smoking because you're sick?

I've tried to quit smoking a few times but never worked. Now that I'm dossed with the flu I've been coughing very heavily for the last five days. I was wondering that because I'm not smoking due to the flu will i be able to stay off them when I'm better. So far I've quit 2 days.

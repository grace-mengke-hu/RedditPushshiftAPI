Tomorrows the day!

So. I'm stopping smoking tomorrow. Had my date planned for a week now with months beforehand spent thinking about it. Got the gum. Got a couple of apps now got you lot too. Scared, excited but mostly scared I'll fail. Brace yourselves for loads of drivel from me! One hour till tomorrow where I am .......

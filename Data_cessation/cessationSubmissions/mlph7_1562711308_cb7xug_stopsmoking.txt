Second day

And I messed up and had one this morning. Just one and didn't go buy a pack or completely derail myself so I'm not feeling too terrible about it but wish I hadn't done it. 

Redeemed myself this afternoon when a friend came by and she went out to smoke. I didn't even think about it and went out with her and when she asked if I was out/needed one I told her I'd quit.  Overall not such a bad day really. It'll get easier eventually.

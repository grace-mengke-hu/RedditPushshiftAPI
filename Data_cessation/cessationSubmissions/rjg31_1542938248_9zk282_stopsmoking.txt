Mental Health/Addiction Subreddit Survey

Hello there!

My name is Ryan, and I am a Counselling Psychology graduate student at City University of Seattle (Calgary Alberta campus). For my thesis, I am really interested in levels of belongingness and stigma attitudes on mental health/addiction subreddits, as well as offline. I would LOVE to have your input regarding your experience on mental health related subreddits! The survey will only take about 15-30 minutes, and the results will hopefully help inform future research and clinicians about the world of Reddit. Each participant that completes the study will be entered into a draw to win a $50 gift card (2 available) to Apple or Google Play (whichever the winner prefers). Two winners will be chosen from the reddit usernames provided in the survey. Thanks for your time everyone, I greatly appreciate it!

I will be sure to provide an update after the study is complete, so everyone knows how their participation impacted mental health research.

Here is the Survey Monkey link to the study: [https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/SNYN33Z](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/SNYN33Z)

Please contact me if you need more information, and I will gladly answer any questions you have!

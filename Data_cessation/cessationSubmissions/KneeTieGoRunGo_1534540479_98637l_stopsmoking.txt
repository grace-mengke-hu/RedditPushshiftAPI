I wish this Dead Ex-Smoker Knew KneeTie

54 year old a blond and her husband is sitting there by her two kids.  Her CT is positive for blood, a subarachnoid Hemorrhage(SAH). Her bp was 270/40. 

Daughter 1: 'Is she going to make it?'

Kid 2: Sigh. 

Husband: 'Why is her blood pressure so high?'

Me: 'I don't know, is she on blood pressure medication?'

Husband: 'Yes.' 

Me: 'Oh..'.

Husband: 'She smoked so she had high blood pressure, but its never been this high.  She was trying to quit for so long. I wish she had quit.'

Me: 'What happened today?;

Husband: 'She was at the store, and all the sudden she dropped to her knees with a horrible headache.'

Me: 'Did she vomit? Or black out?'

Husband: 'I don''t thinks so, she just couldn't move she was in so much pain, and but she was dry heaving.'

Me: 'The CT shows she has a bleed in the brain.' 

Husband: 'What does that mean?'

Me: 'It means there is blood, the white stuff that should be dark CSF, in the brain. Its a SAH.' 

Daughter 2: 'She is going to be ok right?'

Me: I hope so, I wish she knew KneeTie.

Husband: Huh?

Me: Nevermind. 'God Bless Her,  I hope she does well.' 

She was transferred. 

Two weeks later, I learn that she was trying to quit smoking for two years now. But she could not stop. Her blood pressure went up so high. She died in the ICU of infection, and vasospasm, and multiple infarcts thereafter. 

I wish she knew about KneeTie. Maybe she would have been able to spend some more time with her kids.

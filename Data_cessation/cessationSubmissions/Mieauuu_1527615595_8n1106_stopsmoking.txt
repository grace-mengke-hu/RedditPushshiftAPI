4th attempt. Always fail after 1.5 days. What now?

I've almost smoked a pack a day before, and now it seems like i can go pretty exactly 1,5 days without smoking before i get cravings that i can't overcome anymore. i would really like to quit completely. i want it so bad. does anybody have any ideas or tips how i can go past that mark?

Long drives

One of the hardest things about quiting is trying to not smoke during long drives. I travel for work sometimes and I'm on the road for a long time, and I generally would like a smoke when I'm tired. I've been trying to find ways to replace that. 

So I thought to replace that habit with something that actively satisfies my oral fixation. So far I've learned to unshell multiple sunflower seeds at a time, and unwrap starbursts with my tongue. So....ladies....

jkbnr, it works and i'd go hours without even thinking about it. Just thought I'd share.

24-hours in and I'm smelling cigarettes everywhere in my house.

It's a gross smell and I'm happy I no longer have to inflict that on the people around me.

24 hours was pretty easy. I stayed home from work, didn't leave the house, and got high to distract myself. 

Tomorrow will be different, though, as I'm going back to work and will have smokers around me. Also, the half pack I left at my desk (rather than take it home) will be there waiting for me. I know I need to get rid of it, but worry I'll want to take one out before I do, just for old times sake. Silly. 

I've gone 24 hours, I'm doing good, and can continue to do good if I just keep relying on the program I developed.

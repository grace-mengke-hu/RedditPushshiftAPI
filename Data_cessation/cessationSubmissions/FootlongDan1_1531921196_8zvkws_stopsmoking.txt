I used to smoke to cope but now it's a habit, I've previously quit for 3 week (my longest), however I'm now fully aware that it's become a problem for me.

A little bit of background, I'm currently 26 and began smoking at 20 socially and to cope with my anxiety in jobs. 6 years onwards I'm a full time bartender; a job given my past dealing with anxiety I thought I could never do due to how stressful it can be. I know in myself I don't smoke to deal with the stress of my job as I'm competent enough to deal with most of the situations this job can throw at me. I now just smoke, of a morning walking to the bus SMOKE, when I get off the bus SMOKE, get to work SMOKE before starting, when it's not busy in the work SMOKE etc. I also never used to smoke when I wasn't working, however I now just smoke for the sake of it and not particularly spaced out. Has anyone in a similar position/lifestyle kicked this vile and controlling habit who can offer me advice please?

Sincerely, Me.

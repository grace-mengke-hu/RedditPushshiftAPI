Had a cigarette, now am anxious

Hey guys. I've gotten myself down from 30 cigs a day to just one in the last 5 days. 

One at the end of the day before bed. 

Kind of a backwards reward for not smoking all day. 

I know, I know. 

Anyway, I smoked my one cig about an hour ago and am feeling really weird. There was the initial high of the nicotine, but then came the guilt, then depression, then anxiety and finally depersonalization. I know there's nothing wrong with me.... I just kinda wanna know if anyone else has slipped up and felt the same way. Just don't wanna feel alone in this right now.

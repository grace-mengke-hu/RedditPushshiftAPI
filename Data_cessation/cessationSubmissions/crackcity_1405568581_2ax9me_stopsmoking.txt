Had my last smoke Sunday night, struggling right now

I'm 20 years old and have only been smoking for 2 years, but even in those 2 years, I've spent so much money and time on cigarettes and I've felt the effects on my body. This is the second time I've tried to quit, first time was a couple of weeks ago and I only made it 5 days. I have 3 cigarettes in my car right now so it's really an ultimate test of will-power. I've even taken one out intending to smoke it, then decided against it and put it back. I'm using those as a fall-back, because otherwise, I'm afraid the same thing that happened a couple weeks ago will happen and I'll just say screw it and buy another pack. I've been chewing gum, drinking lots of water, and singing to try to ease the urges, but tonight I'm struggling. I feel like I'm going to cry. I've cried while at work already, which is super embarrassing, but I still haven't caved. I want to so bad right now. Reading about everyone's success is helping, but I'm still having a really hard time not screwing this up. AHHHHHHHHH

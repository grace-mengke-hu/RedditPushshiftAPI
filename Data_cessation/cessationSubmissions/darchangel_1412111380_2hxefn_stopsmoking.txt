1 day-ers: you can do this!

I just passed by 1 year mark and to celebrate I just gave gold to everyone I could find on here who is on day 1. I hope it helps encourage you in these shitty early days. (If I missed you I'm sorry -- I did all I could find and all I could afford.)

Lest this come across the wrong way: This isn't about me. It's about them.

It's about you.

It's about all of us.

I give this sub a lot of credit toward my success in quitting and I wanted to give something back. Please, everyone continue to give each other the great support I felt a year ago. You are helping make a real difference in the life and health of others on here.

Thanks to everyone here who made a difference for me.

First Few Days

Hey there everyone! 

I finally made the decision to quit when I was flipping through pics of my wedding gown shopping trip. I saw my teeth and just knew I would never forgive myself if my actual wedding pics looked like that. 

That being said, quitting is not easy. Not only because of the actual addiction, but because of the routine. I'm only four days in, but that means I'm through the worst of it. Further, in those four days, I've worked three shifts at a bar where smoking is allowed, and 90% of the people there smoke. 

1. I'm sure most of you are using the Smoke Free beta app which is whstbprobably lead you here. If you aren't, it really helps! Having something tangible at your fingertips to track your progress (and money saved!) Is a true motivater to stay on the Smoke Free side of life. 

2. This one is a bit weird, but for some reason worked -- a tablespoon of baking soda in an 8 oz. Glass of water twice a day for a week. I personally messed up the first glass and added waaayyyyyy too much baking soda. Made me sick as a dog.  For the next two days, when I had real cravings, my brain auto corrected to that taste and nausea and I did not want to smoke. It's supposed to be based on chemistry -- neutralizing the acidic stuff we eat/drink which makes us crave cigs. I just made it work a different way I guess. 

3. Set SHORT term goals for the money saved. It's one thing to see that you save $2000 a year, and to set a long term goal with that. It's completely different to have something obtainable within the week. For example, I really need a haircut. I'm not allowing myself to get one until I've saved enough cig money.  So 9 days smoke free and I can take this mane!!

4. Ive been using my e-cig to get me through my long commute. I get bored, I smoke. Even the empty one helps a bit because I'm chewing on that instead of grinding my teeth at the bad drivers. 

I hope some of this helps!

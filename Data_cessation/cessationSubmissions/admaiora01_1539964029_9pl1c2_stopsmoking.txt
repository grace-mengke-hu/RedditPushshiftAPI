My mom started smoking again

Hey guys,

we've all been stresses lately in my family, my mother especially, and I think this took a toll on her. She stopped smoking cold turkey around 10 year ago after like 30 years of smoking, but today I found a cigarette butt and since it's only the two of us here I know it's her. Should I confront her about this? I don't believe a cigarette every now and then it's that bad but I don't want her to be addicted to it again...

Only 3 days in and having some intense emotions

I'm on my third night nicotine free and feeling very depressed. I already struggle with depression, but since quitting I break down crying several times a day. It happens very suddenly, and I'm just generally feeling overwhelmed. The best part is, the crying fits make me feel like a weak piece of shit since it's only been 72 hours. I feel like I child pouting over no dessert. 

I just need to hear that it gets easier and that I'm not completely over reacting. Anyone out there experiencing similar things?

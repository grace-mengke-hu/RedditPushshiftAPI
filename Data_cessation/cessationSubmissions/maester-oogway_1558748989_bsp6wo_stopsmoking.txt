30 days smokefree but losing will power..

So I just found this sub because I have been experiencing a large lack of support from my friend group (they are 90% smokers). This is my first time quitting and today marks one month without a cigarette but after a relationship breakdown this morning I am having the worst cravings since the 72-hour mark.   


I appreciate any support or tips to prevent me from caving in. TIA

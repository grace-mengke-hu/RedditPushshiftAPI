I smoked a pack in two weeks, but now I quit. What should I expect?

Despite knowing the risks and dangers, I've had a strange craving for smoking since I was a kid.

Just this month, in a moment of novelty seeking, I bought a pack and tried. It was alright, but I mostly enjoyed the physical act of smoking. Really, it made me dizzy and have a headache.

Now, I threw away the beginning of a new pack after being tired of it.

What should I expect in the next coming days? Will I get a lot of headaches? Or feel moody?

Made it through day 1... feeling proud but just wish I could sleep...

I've officially made it 27 hours without smoking... it's the first time I've done this since I got my wisdom teeth out 4 years ago so I'm feeling very accomplished. The only thing that's breaking me is the sleep deprivation...

I actually shed a few tears on the subway this evening simply bcuz I was feeling so tired (I'm embaressed to admit this, but it's the truth)... yet, now it's 4 am and I haven't slept for a minute... have to wake up in a few hours for a full day of meetings and I'm starting to panic. 

I'm looking for reassurance that it gets easier and some suggestions on sleeping better. I only have one cup of coffee per day.

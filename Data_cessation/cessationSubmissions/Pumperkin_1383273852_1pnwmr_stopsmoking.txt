slowly ramping up

My real adventure in quitting began about a month ago.  I (much) later learned through Allen Carr's book that the spark was created by a time of high stress (read: low income).  As the stress disappeared, so did my desire to quit.  However, as my education and subsequent motivation increased, so did my desire to quit.  No lie, there have been disappointments and setbacks along the way.  This is not an easy thing I am up against.  I am finding my own path.  This path may not be the most direct point from A to B, but it is my path.  I accept that somewhere along the way, this path will divide between smoking and not.  I would rather walk the path to freedom than be pushed into imprisonment and certain death.  Once again, my favorite quote from this sub - "Quitting is annoying for a while.  Smoking is annoying forever."  I hate making these struggle posts... it's embarrassing to myself.  Lucky for me that on the internet, no one knows that you're a smoking dog.

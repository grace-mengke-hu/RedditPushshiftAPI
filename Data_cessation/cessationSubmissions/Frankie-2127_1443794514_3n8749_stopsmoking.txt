Is depression common? Help....

I quit 6 days ago, and although I've quit many, many times before, I was determined to quit for good this time. I smoked for 28 years and now that I've stopped I feel like I've lost my best friend. I'm having a hard time looking at the positives when I feel I'm in a depressive funk. Anyone else feel this way? When does it get better?? At times it feels like quitting isn't worth this anguish.....

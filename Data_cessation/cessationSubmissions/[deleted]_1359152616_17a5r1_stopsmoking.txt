I quit last sunday

So as of now I am smoke free for 5 days. I already have more energy and feel great. I have hid my smoking from my parents for the last three years. I noticed this year I was up to about a pack a day and started doing uncomfortable math, amount my much money I was spending, how many cigs I had smoked in total, stuff like that.  How do you guys deal with the headaches?

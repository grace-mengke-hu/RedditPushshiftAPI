day 3 cos of Alan Carr

Hey everyone, I attended Allan Carr's seminar on sunday. I went out that night and drank a ton and got many strong cig cravings but my parents were around so I managed not to smoke, also I paid 400 bucks for the seminar so I wanted to go for at least a month without having a cig. That obviously isn't the only reason I want to quit. Anyway, my question for anyone who quit a month or more back. How's the weight gain???? Can I do smething to stop my metabolism from going down?

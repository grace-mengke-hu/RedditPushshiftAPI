2 weeks today

Went home over the weekend and the trip to and from without cigs seemed longer than usual. I was such a chronic clumsy car smoker, the liner next to my window looks ridiculous BUT if I keep this up I can actually fix it cause I know I won’t burn another hole it it lol. 

It’s funny how I wake up like “Yes! I get to smoke today!” and then remember “oh shit! I actually don’t do that anymore!” but I’m in too deep now for it to feel the same I think.

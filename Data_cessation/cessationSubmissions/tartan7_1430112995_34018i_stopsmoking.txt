Social anxiety

Today I didn't wear a nicotine patch just to try it out and it was fine. I exercised a lot today. Went grocery shopping and ran into someone I knew. I felt like I broke out in a cold sweat or something. Having to deal with just saying hello made me want to run straight out of the store. Is this normal? Has anyone else experienced this? I feel very anxious.

4 weeks today! It's been the easiest time yet, but I had a bit of help.

I've felt really good about my quit! I've tried a number of times in the past, but this time has been a breeze. The thought hardly even crosses my mind. I've successfully been out drinking (my no. 1 trigger) a number of nights without ridiculous urges and walked away smoke free. I am so happy!

I've had help with Wellbutrin (aka Zyban), however. A few weeks prior to my quit day I started seeing a therapist. I've been having trouble managing my stress and was diagnosed with depression. My doc said Wellbutrin should do a nice job aiding my way out of depression as well as battle my addiction to cigarettes. So far one thing is for sure, it's the best thing I've done yet to stop smoking.

On my quit day, after about 2 weeks on Wellbutrin, it was the easiest first day I've ever experienced. Even a few days prior, cigarettes really didn't feel or taste the same. And the smell. Oh man the smell was awful and still is. The smell is even more repulsive now that I ever remember. I didn't notice any of the normal withdrawl symtoms I suffered on other attempts. Everything, as far as no more cigarettes goes, was just so much better. My depression is another story, but I'll save that for another thread.

I'm looking forward to writing another update in 4 more weeks! :)

Day 15 no smoking..

Using a vape, but at 0% nicotine. Breathing better and more energy but I swear I’m so much more anxious, feeling nervous and overthinking things. Didn’t have this anxiety until I quit. Now I feel like I’m crazy. Glad I quit, just wishing I wasn’t nuts and didn’t suddenly become insecure and start saying stupid things. Almost 40 and feel like I’m in high school again.

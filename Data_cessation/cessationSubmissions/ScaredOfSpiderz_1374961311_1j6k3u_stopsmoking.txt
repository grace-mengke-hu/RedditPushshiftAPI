There really is no such thing as "just one" is there?

Just drags you right down that f*cking hole again. And what's so good about them anyway? They're just making me miserable. And they're so cheap in this country, no financial incentive at all. 

Other people can smoke just one or a few when they're out. Not me. I'm right out there the next day buying a single cigarette (300 pesos, very little) from that nice guy on the corner. Small talk and cig, why not? I'm gonna quit anyway. Now I'm back to substituting breakfast with two cigarettes and a cup of coffee. 

Man, and breakfast tasted so good when I quit. I would experiment with different fruit combinations in the morning. This country has a rediculous range of exotic fruits I'd pay a small fortune for in my own country if I could find them at all. Now it's the mundane flavor of dried up burning tobacco and I'll eat some roasted shit from a sidewalk restaurant when I get hungry. Bland, boring and far from nutricious. Why do I care so little about my health? I used to be athletic. Long time ago.

I wanna lose this ball and chain, this chemical and mental slavery, this burden on myself and others around me.

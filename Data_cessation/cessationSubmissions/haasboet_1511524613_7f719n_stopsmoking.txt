Stop smoking for good

I have been struggling with smoking for the last week after a period of good abstinence with only small flair ups.

I am the type of smoker who has gotten into the habit of quitting and restarting so frequently that quitting, in some sense, loses its meaning. 

Right now I need to get over these first few days of struggling. (sometimes its effortless mind you) but i'm not really in control of that. In a way if it is difficult and I pull through it, its more psychologically meaningful.

I am going to try to be involved in this community and continually share where i'm at with recovery from smoking addiction and its associated multitude of problems that it causes for me.

I will try to empathize and be supportive of other people on this journey. 

This afternoon I committ, for better, or for worse, to non smoking.

Tonight the same.

Tomorrow I commit to non smoking and on Sunday too.

I commit to non-smoking and will recommit if necessary, too!!!!

Hypersomnia and smoking cessation

Okay so I quit 5 months ago and that quit lasted 3 months before relapse. I am now on my first full day of cold turkey again (smoked last cig at around 5pm yesterday). 

Both these cold turkey quits I have been suffering from hypersomnia. For example I just slept from 11pm - 2pm so 15 hours sleep. I typically suffer from insomnia. 

Did you guys experience excessive sleep when quitting cold turkey? 

I guess I am lucky itâ€™s been slow at work.

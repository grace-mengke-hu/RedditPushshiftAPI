One month in, and never felt better about it. Quitting was different this time.

I smoked for about 20 years. I'd say it was a pack a day or more for at least ten of those years, and I'd attempted quitting many times over the last five years with no success. This time it's been different and I haven't struggled at all. 

I think I owe a portion of my success to downloading and listening to Allen Carr's audiobook.  What he says makes a lot of sense and helped me rationalize my smoking and how to stop in a concise and easy way.

I've read through a few threads in this sub today and I'd recommed listening to or reading Allen Carr's book for anyone who is struggling daily, hourly, or by the minute with smoking.

I don't have any cravings.  I don't have any mantra I repeat to myself a thousand times a day.  I don't count the time it's been since I've last smoked (a friend asked me how it was going with not smoking this morning and I had to look it up again). I don't calculate the money I've saved. I don't consider myself to be an ex-smoker, and I knew from the minute I extinguished my last cigarette that I would be a nonsmoker.

I went off on the weather man :( (I guess I am still Highlander Angie part of the time)

So I had a bad night and ended up getting up again at like 3:00am.  I don't know what time it was exactly, but the local weather guy comes on TV and starts talking about our "impressive" temps.  We are very unseasonably warm and we have no snow pack.  It's a bad drought situation.  Meanwhile I am half asleep, and dying for a smoke and so I go to this poor guys FB and totally go off on him saying that these "impressive" temps are killing us here and the rivers are drying up and blah blah blah.  The I fall asleep on the couch like right after.  I felt so bad, he replied and explained what he meant, which would have been obvious had I not been half asleep and having a nic fit.  He is such a sweetheart I felt like Godzilla.

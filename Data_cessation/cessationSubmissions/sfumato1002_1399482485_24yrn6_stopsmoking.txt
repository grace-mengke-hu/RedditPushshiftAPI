90 days!

For the most part i have this undercontrol, somedays are better than others. But I still have the lingering thought of smoking again. Sometimes I walk by the tobacco store and there is that inner voice telling me "hey look!, its open, want to buy a pack?" Of course I ignore the voice and just walk on by. I enjoy my sense of smell...I did not know I had that sense LOL. I feel good and I don't cough or spit green stuff anymore. My health has improven a lot. Here is to another 90 days!

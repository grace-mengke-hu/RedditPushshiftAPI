Day 10 w/out smoking. Unable to motivate myself to do anything but eat.

I am going insane. I feel like I have no motivation to do ANYTHING. Smoking was my reward. Now all I want to do is eat and sit motionless at my PC. My spouse does not understand. He has been militant that I quit smoking and he has no understanding of what I am going through. He goes,"Yeah I understand addiction, I love bad food." He doesn't get that while every once in a while he can lapse and visit McDonalds but I can NEVER SMOKE AGAIN.

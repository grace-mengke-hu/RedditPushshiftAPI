What would be the result of quitting smoking for at least a week at a time and returning to smoking repeatedly?

i.e. What would happen if you only smoked during the first and third weeks of the month

Would you experience the same quitting symptoms ad infinitum, or would it start to get really easy to not smoke during weeks 2 and 4?

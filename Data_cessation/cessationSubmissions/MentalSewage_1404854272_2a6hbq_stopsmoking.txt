Quitting the second time, is it always harder?

Back a couple years ago I managed to quit smoking by smoking Lobellia instead of Tobacco (Rolled my own, no nicotine but the body thinks Lobeline is the same thing.  No nic fits, repairs taste buds, regular tobacco tastes REDICULOUSLY gross, etc).  Within a week I went from being a pack a day smoker to smoking 1 lobellia cigarette a day without a single urge to smoke cigarettes (Because the couple I had in the time left me gagging).

I was completely smoke free for two months and never felt better... then life decided to smack me with layoffs, baby mama drama, and lack of dating.  I went on break with a couple smoker friends, and found myself more and more often bumming a cigarette despite the immediate gag reflex that Lobellia gives you, eventually tolerating it and finally buying a pack.

My life has significantly improved and I want to quit smoking again.  Only this time, the Lobellia is in no way satisfying and I can't seem to talk myself into switching again.  Cold turkey lasted all of 4 hours.  Has anybody else noticed that the second time quitting is even harder than the first?  And does anybody else have experience using lobellia that might know some tricks to keep my interested in it?

TL;DR: Quit once using Lobellia, lasted a few months, life smacked me, started smoking again.  Can't seem to quit near as easy this time.  Common occurance?

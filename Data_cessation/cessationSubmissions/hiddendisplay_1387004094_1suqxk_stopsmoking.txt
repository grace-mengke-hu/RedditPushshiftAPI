I thought I was in the clear..

And now I'm having those ridiculous dreams where I'm smoking.
It even feels unnatural in my dreams, and I remember thinking "Well, I just won't inhale all the way.."

I wake up in such a panic every time, thinking I've wasted 60 days of effort.

Any one have any experience with this, or know when these dreams will go away?

My mother and I are quitting together.

She smoked before she had us kids, and started again last year (after 30 quit) and I've been smoking for almost 5 years. We're both pretty bad about accountability with things like this (tried to quit caffeine a few years back- same issue) but work well with reward systems. I've created my monthly chart by putting away half of what I would've spent on cigarettes- so half of $50/week. I'm all set and eager to quit now that I've got my "carrots" lined up (boots I've been eyeing but haven't had the money for, a nice dinner out, and a small tattoo for month 3) and we've agreed on a quit date a week from now (so our synced periods don't line up with the first week.) My main concern is that she isn't going to keep going with it. Having someone to quit with has always seemed important to me, but come next week I'm quitting with or without her... any tips for maintaining accountability? or living with a smoker while quitting?

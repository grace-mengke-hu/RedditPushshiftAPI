Two weeks in, really struggling

I've been a pack-a-day smoker for about 15 years, and finally quit two weeks ago, cold turkey, after reading Allen Carr. 

The first few days went better than I expected - I honestly didn't know if I was capable of not smoking. But two weeks in, the basic physical cravings are gone and I feel infinitely worse. My brain is off, I feel super depressed, and it all seems pointless. 

I've read 3-6 weeks for your brain to start to recover from this, but frankly all the timeframes are BS. No one can really give me a serious idea of when I'll start to feel better, and in the meantime, my life is a disaster. I'm not working well and not getting anything done. I can't afford to just check out of my life for another month. 

I don't want to fail, because I don't know if I'll be able to work up the courage to quit again. These two weeks are a huge step for me, but I don't know if I can make it. Help!

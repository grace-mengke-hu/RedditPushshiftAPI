I only want to smoke when I drink alcohol, and then I buy a pack...

Just as the title says, I only really crave cigarettes when I drink alcohol. Lowered inhibitions cause me to buy a pack, and then I just smoke them throughout the week. By the time the next weekend rolls around, I'm out of cigarettes again, and I inevitably buy another pack. Also somewhat hurts that a lot of my friends smoke, so there's always cigarettes around.

Anyone have any experience with this sort of cycle? I'm really ready to quit, I just need strategies to combat cravings when I drink.

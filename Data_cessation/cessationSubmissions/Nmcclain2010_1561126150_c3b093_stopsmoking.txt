I gave in ðŸ˜”

I hit the 3-4 month mark &amp; gave into a craving that I had been fighting off for weeks. Now I've been smoking for a week. I made the choice to forgive myself &amp; start my non-smoking journey over. I'm very disappointed in myself. My spouse doesn't really make it any better because instead of trying to look up with me &amp; start over, she wants to be mad at me for smoking. So that's a bit stressful &amp; hurtful but I'll make it.

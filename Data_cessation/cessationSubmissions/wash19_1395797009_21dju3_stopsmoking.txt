So, I'm aiming for a quit date, post-US summer. Can you guys give me a few tips to slow-burn (sorry) the quitting process?

I've been smoking for 13 years, at around half a pack a day, and I'm 26 (I took my parent's divorce hard). Any tips for quitting slow? I've tried cold-turkey, and I just smoke again a month later. Oddly enough, I think I need closure, time to bid farewell to the habit as it were.

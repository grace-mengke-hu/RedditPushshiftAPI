6:20 mile.

Since May of 2015 I've quit and quit and quit again. I started smoking when I was 17, which didn't make sense because I was a really good runner, wrestler and swimmer before then. I joined the military and, well, smoke 'em if you got 'em. I continued smoking 1/2 a pack to a pack a day until May 2015. I set a goal to run a local race (a hilly, brutal 7 miler) and so I used running as a good motivator to quit. I did okay in the race and then by September 2015 I was smoking here and there. I smoked again until January of this year and then I got fed up and started running again. This time, I was really running. Training hard. I ran a pretty fast 5k and I was proud of myself. Then I got cocky. I'm stronger than cigarettes, I thought...wrong. In May I started smoking again. Then I decided to quit and train for a half-marathon. The training helped me not smoke at all, since the mileage was more than I'd ever run before. Things were great...then I got injured. I didn't run for 4 weeks so naturally why not start smoking again. I smoked up until the day before the half marathon. I ran pretty well considering my injury, lack of cardio and the unexpected heat. It's been 2 weeks since I had a cigarette and last night I ran a 6:20 mile. Running and setting goals are what keeps me from smoking. Find out what works for you and try your best to stick with it, and remember, just ONE can send you back to being a smoker.

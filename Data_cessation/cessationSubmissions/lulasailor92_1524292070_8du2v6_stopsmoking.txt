Bronchitis 4 days after quitting date

So I had planned on quitting smoking for 2 weeks, doing it gradually, reading Allen Carr's book, preparing myself mentally and practically - my quitting date was set on April 16, 2.40pm. It's now been 4 days and I have bronchitis! I usually have it when I smoke a lot, I don't understand why I'm having it now! Has it happened to you guys, did you feel ill when you stopped smoking?

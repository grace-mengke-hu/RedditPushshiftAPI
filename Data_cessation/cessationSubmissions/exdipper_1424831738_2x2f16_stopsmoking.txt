Cold turkey vs NRT, very difficult situation.

So I am a Heavy dipper and smoker. I absolutely hate being a nicotine addict. My mind is never at peace, I can never focus, I can never be happy, before during AND after nicotine consumption. 

When I quit, I go two days max before I cave. I come up with lame excuses that I believe, like "you realize you are going to start up soon, might as well get it over quickly and have another now so you can give it up for good the next time." On my quit attempt today, I just woke up and said to myself "Fuck this" and was at 711 in my pajamas. 

As much as I hate to do it, I feel like I should get some gum or an ecig and try again after the semester is over. My gums CANT stand anymore dip. My teeth are going to fall out. I've almost stopped smoking cigarettes and have been dipping more because I can't stand the smell and dirty feel. At this point I feel so hopeless I am practically begging for some sound advice to point me in the right direction. Thank you.

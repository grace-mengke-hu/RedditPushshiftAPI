Day 4 and I need a fucking smoke

All I could think of when I woke up this morning was how much I "needed" a fucking smoke.  I laid in bed for like 5 minutes and took deep breaths and let the craving pass.  

I was ok until after I finished my workout at the gym and all I my mind keeps yelling at me how much I just need one fucking smoke and it will be ok.  I know that this is false, I just need to get this off my chest (no pun intended).

Eating instead of smoking

Sorry for bad formating, first time posting. 
So, I've been smoke free for 3 weeks today. I would say it was surprisingly easy, with little to no sideffects. Except eating. I feel constant need for food. Especially sweets. And it makes me sick how much I can and want to eat now. Also, it hits me really hard since I used to be owerweight and now, I'm slowly gaining that weight back. I have seriously thought about starting smoking again, just so I would not feel hungry all the time. Does anyone have any advice to help me with cravings, like what can I do not to feel hungry. I tried drinking water, and i did not help.

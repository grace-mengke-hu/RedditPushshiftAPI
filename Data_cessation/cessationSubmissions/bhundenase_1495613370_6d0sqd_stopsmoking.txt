4 days i guess?

so after my exams were over, i decided its time to stop doing stupid things. havent smoked a cigarette since then, havent smoked weed since then (i used to smoke 3-4 times a day, even during exams). its getting easier now i guess, i do get super restless some times but i listen to  any of my favourite music, by the time the track ends, i feel better about the craving, its still there though.

the thing is, i dont know if i'll be able to keep this up for toolong. the college starts again in august and im pretty sure im going to smoke then. i may remain strong for some time, but my mind is a real bastard. it somehow will convince me that its ok to smoke that cigarette because of this stress. or maybe smoking weed isnt that bad if i only do it occassionally but guess what? thats the start of the cycle and ill be down in the gutter all over again.. lets see what happens...
PLEASE GOD dont ever let me even touch that shit again..

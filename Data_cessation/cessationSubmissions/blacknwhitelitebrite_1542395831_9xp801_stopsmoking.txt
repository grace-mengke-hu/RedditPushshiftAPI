Day 30! Proposed menthol ban triggering cravings?

Just wanted to share my thoughts! I made it to day 30, tobacco and nicotine free thanks to inspiration from the Allen Carr book, this subreddit, and the app. It certainly hasn’t been easy. I’ve been a pack a day smoker for 10 years and never have I made it this far.

I feel I’ve strayed quite a bit from the Carr method, as I still find myself wanting to smoke. The nicotine withdraw is practically gone, but I’m just not convinced that I never enjoyed tobacco. 

The proposal to ban menthols has me really craving! I know this is silly, but my addicted brain thinks, “You may never get to smoke your brand again!” I shouldn’t be thinking this way, since I never want to smoke again period, but it’s somehow easier knowing that if I want to go back, I can. 

Anyway, I’m not too worried, as my desire to stay a nonsmoker is much stronger than irrational fears of losing my brand. I’m not losing anything! I’m gaining a healthy, nicotine free life!

Hope everyone is well.

I helped shame a girl for being a smoker and instantly regretted It

Yesterday while walking, I saw people basically shaming a friend of theirs for smoking. They saw me and said “smoking brings all the AIDS, right?”and I said yes. Thinking to myself that I’m happy with myself that I’m almost a year into my quit.

I then realised that I basically help her friends shame her about her addiction!! And I feel horrible for it! I wish I said things differently to her and to her friends. When I smoked I know how much smoking hurts, I know I should quit. It’s a terrible feeling of being helpless. Not to mention that previous quits. A few people literally laughed at me for relapsing. 

All I wanted was support at the time and I got it through this lovely sub. And yet I did to this poor stranger what others did to me when I smoked. I’m just disappointed in myself. 

I really wish I could apologise to her.

So close to a year, my biggest trial

My husband left me 2 days ago. I'm feeling rather destructive, but luckily I have an amazing support system that refuses to let me do stupid shit, including smoking cigarettes. So for now I'll just chew off my finger nails and bite my lips like crazy (ouch btw) and cry randomly throughout the day. I think the fact that I am now car-less and literally can't afford it is a big help right now.

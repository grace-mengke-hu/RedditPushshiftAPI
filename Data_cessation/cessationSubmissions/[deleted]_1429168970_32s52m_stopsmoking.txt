Smoking makes me feel like shit

Don't mind my badge, I'll reset it soon. 


Smoking always makes me feel worse. I try to quit and always start again and I feel worse than I did before.... 


Why do I keep going for a cigarette? 


I read Allen Carr twice and it seems like it doesn't work for me. 


I just got another pack and want to quit after this one, how do I not fail this time? 


I have quit for 2 years before and during that time I never had any desire to smoke, I even felt relieved. It seems like I can't get into this state again... Please help me.

Chicago just raised the smoking age to 21 so now is a good of time as any

Just got denied a pack of cigarettes today for the first time since I turned 18 in Chicago. I'm 20 y/o and i've been wanting to quit for a while. I mainly smoke out of stress, due to working 2 part time jobs and studying statistics in school. On top of that I take vyvanse every morning, which makes chainsmoking so nice. But, I have noticed that I gag more when I smoke, and my parents caught me smoking and were very disappointed, so I have been wanting to quit. I exercise daily but it actually doesn't make much of a difference. I tried the gum but I realize that I love the routine of smoking just as much as the actual nicotine. So, I am now ready to put myself in the full mindset of quitting, I just don't know how to dodge the intense cravings.

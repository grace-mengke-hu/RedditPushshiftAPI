Unsupportive friends

Excuse the rant.
After 2.5 years of smoking I quit. I'm on day 6, and honestly I've been feeling really good about myself. I haven't had any panic attacks, crying fits, or anger issues like last time. 
That is, until I met up with my smoking friends. In the few hours I spent with them, they were very unsupportive and kept making me question my decision. It's so hard, because this is the time I'd need them to be there for me and not blow their goddamned smoke into my face. Does anyone have any advice on how to deal with this kind of bullshit?
I kept strong though, so onto day 7 we go.

I've been lurking for months. It's been 2 months since I quit and I think it's time to start celebrating!

I quit smoking May 8th 2013 and I didn't tell anyone other than family and close friends.  

Honestly I was afraid to tell anyone because I was afraid I might fail.  I know that may sound ridiculous and negative.  But, I was afraid.  

After so many failed attempts, I didn't want to disappoint myself and others.  

My husband is so happy and loves to kiss me, now that I don't taste like an ashtray.  I wanted to share my excitement and to thank /r/stopsmoking for the motivation and help.

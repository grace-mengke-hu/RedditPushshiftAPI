Caved after 405 days, words of wisdom??

I quit cold turkey 406 days ago after a wicked migraine landed me in hospital with suspected TIA (mini stroke). I was 21 at the time and terrified. Now, I've lost all the motivation/discipline that kept me going in the first place. Shit hit the fan in my family recently and I didn't know what else to do so I had a smoke. Then I woke up had two more over the course of today. I fucked up and I don't know how to stop myself. It's like i'm watching myself do it but I just can't put it down. I keep thinking maybe just one more today then I won't have any tomorrow, like a last hurrah or something.. Wait for it to get out of my system while i'm sleeping then start fresh. But I know that kind of thinking is dangerous. I'm trying to go easy on myself because I do stupid things when I start to get down on myself but shit, I just don't know what I'm doing.

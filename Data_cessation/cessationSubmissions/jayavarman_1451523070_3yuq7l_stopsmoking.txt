I can't live another year like this.

I smoke, I drink too much, I let my compulsive behavior control my life. I refuse to waste another year living life a complete idiot, and I have to deal with smoking first. I resolved to just smoke black and milds a few months ago and I was doing well for a while, usually one a day. But today I had four. I got hope and immediately vomited. I can feel smoking actively killing me, and I can't let myself do this anymore.

Day 1

I'm quitting smoking today.  My life has been a pretty big mess and I am trying to fix it.  I quit drinking 2 weeks ago.  It has been a struggle but I have been doing good so far.  I told myself if I made it 2 weeks without drinking, I would quit smoking as well.  So today here I am.  

I feel so much better after quitting drinking just after 2 weeks.  I know that is only going to get better by doing this as well.  Wednesday really solidified my decision to quit.  We got about a foot of snow and I had to shovel for about 2 hours.  When I came inside I coughed so hard that I actually threw up.  

Smoking is bad for my health, costs way too much money, makes me stink, has made my teeth yellow, and has made me lazier.  It is so easy for me to sit at the computer and smoke half a pack and dick around on the computer playing games on Facebook rather than doing something productive with my time.

I'm going to start a diet and exercise program on Monday as well to keep me motivated.  I just want to stop making excuses and being lazy and make myself a better person all around.

I was watching Pursuit of Happyness last night on ABC, and a quote really hit me hard.  **"When I was young and I'd get an A on a history test.. or whatever.. I'd get this good feeling about all the things that I could be. And then I never became any of them."**

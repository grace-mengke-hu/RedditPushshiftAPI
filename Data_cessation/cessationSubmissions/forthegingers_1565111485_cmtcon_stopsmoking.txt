i resisted an urge

on day 10. last night i was craving badly and feeling pretty upset at the world but for someone reason i kept repeating to myself “i don’t actually enjoy cigarettes. i am not deprived by not smoking”

i ended up making some tea. playing guitar. and going to bed with a smoke. very thankful i have a solution to my problem today. and very grateful i didn’t return to hell last night

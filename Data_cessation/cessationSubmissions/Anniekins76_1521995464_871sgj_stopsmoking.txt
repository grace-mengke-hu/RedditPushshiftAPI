One month today!! Thank you all SO much!

Really would have struggled without this sub. Thanks so much for all your support and advice, and just for being here to hang out and read all your posts when the cravings hit. I’m absolutely LOVING being a non smoker and albeit that I regret having my “just one” in January and having to reset my counter from 1 year 3 months to zero... I’m actually glad it happened as I’m armed with the knowledge that just one is never just one, AND it makes you feel worse not better. So I KNOW this time is it and that I’m a NON SMOKER FOREVER! 😊❤️ thanks so much everyone xx

Cravings

I quit smoking on February 15th and haven't smoked a single cigarette since. Recently my girlfriend broke up with me. We were only together for two months but I miss her so much. I really thought she was the love of my lifeðŸ˜”Anyway, I'm having terrible cravings now. I don't want to start smoking again but it is so tempting right now.

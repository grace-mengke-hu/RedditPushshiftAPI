It's weird when cravings strike this far in

So at 113 days, it's weird to get an overwhelming thought of "holy mother of.. I want a cigarette"

I'm thankful that I'm at a point where the process of cheating would require me to actually go to the store and procure those smokes, and that I know I won't do that. But arrrg. 

This too shall pass :)

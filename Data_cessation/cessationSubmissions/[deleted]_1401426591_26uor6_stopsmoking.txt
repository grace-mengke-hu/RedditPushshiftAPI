1 month!

Almost gave in today, but I realized that its just not worth it. If I was able to put up with serious cravings for a month, I can continue doing it. I'm in the process of preparing for a 400km bike ride from Toronto to Huntsville and beyond, loving that i'm no longer huffing and puffing when riding my bike around the corner, or getting winded while out with my friends. I'm feeling great, and I'm even trying to get my brother to quit and get him on here.

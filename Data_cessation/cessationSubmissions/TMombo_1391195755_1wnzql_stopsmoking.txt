What to do to replace smoking?

So as the title says, I probably don't need the assistance quitting as much as I am curious. Some backround on me,

I'm a 20 something university student, smoked cigars in high school, started at parties bumming them and escalated as it always does to buying my own and then eventually cigarettes. I have smoked 1-3 cigarettes a day for almost 3 years. Nothing crazy, have quit for a month here or month there and just started again because I got bored or whatever self-destructive reason was applicable at the time.

I find myself smoking more often then not just to kill some time so here I pose the question: What would be a reasonable 5-10 minute replacement for smoking that can be done between classes, at the train station, on a walk home etc.

Not really looking for "Anything would be better, you're killing yourself".

Genuinely curious of the responses 

Cheers

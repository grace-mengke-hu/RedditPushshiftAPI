Cold-turkey VS quit-aids. Best way(s) to avoid relapse?

Thanks in advance, and power to you all.  
  
1st time quitter here, using the all-natural (CT) approach. Smoked since I was 18, so a 7-year self-abuser!  
Things are going well so far, but cravings are sneaking up on me as idle thoughts and daydreams; “I’m clearly over the hump now, so why can’t I start smoking again.” - “Maybe I’ll just have a smoke a few times a year, on special occasions.” - “What if I could…?” etc. etc. Ad nauseam! I know it’s just my resolve trying to weasel out of quitting whenever I’m not paying attention. But I’m dreading a relapse and have questions:  
  
  
Firstly, will my brain subconsciously flirting with nicotine behind my back become less frequent/powerful?  
  
  
Secondly, at this stage, does it sound like I should be using aid/supplements?

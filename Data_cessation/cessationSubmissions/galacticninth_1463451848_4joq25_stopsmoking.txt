Do you ever stop wanting to smoke?

I came to this subreddit and I am floored by all that you guys have accomplished. I just wanted to ask you guys if you ever get to a point where you don't like smoking. Like do you ever get to a point where you wouldn't smoke even if some magical cigarette was invented that wasn't toxic? I've quit a few times for months sometimes and I always come back because I always want to. Way after the physical addiction is gone I am still psychologically addicted. I always want one. Do you ever get to a point where you stop having to resist urges? Ex smokers often tell me (when they see me smoking) that they haven't smoked for years but the smell is still delicious and they wish they could have one. Does that ever stop? or are you addicted for life?

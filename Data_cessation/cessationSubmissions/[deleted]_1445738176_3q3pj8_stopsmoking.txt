My quit smoking blog age 24. Please give me support.

Okay so I'm on day two of no smoking. Mood is shitty right now. I've been pretty irritable but it is good for me in the long run. I can't let people I love down and ruin my health for these stupid things. I will post updates every so often. The updates will become gradually less and less as I quit.

Right now I almost caved. I went to the store to buy some snacks to get over the craving but I didn't buy any cigarettes. How did I even start? How did I get to this point of addiction? 

I just need to make it 3 more days and it will get easier. Good luck guys.

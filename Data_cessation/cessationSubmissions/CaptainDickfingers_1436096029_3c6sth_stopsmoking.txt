Only been smoking for 6 months but I gave up recently and have acheived a week without cigerettes!

The cravings are becoming less and less... last night I had some beers and it was really strong but I resisted. My main reason for giving up was that at my first rugby preseason session I felt very unfit compared to the previous year and I think it is connected with smoking... even though I smoked about 3-5 a day. Can already feel the health benefits... I have stopped coughing and have no flem anymore and my breathing feels a lot clearer.

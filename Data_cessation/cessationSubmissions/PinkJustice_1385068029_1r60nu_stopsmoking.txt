Hanging my head and resetting my badge

I fucked up. I quit smoking while in a bad relationship and it gave me something to focus on during the breakup. Post break up I was happy, going out and having fun with friends. Well fun led to drinking which led to smoking. I made it about 200 days smoke free. :/  I am currently in a great relationship with a woman who hates smoking and I can't keep hiding it from her and ignoring my own health!  I believe I have learned from my mistakes this last time and I will remain a non smoker starting today! 
   I'm happy to be back in the community and hope everyone is having a great day!

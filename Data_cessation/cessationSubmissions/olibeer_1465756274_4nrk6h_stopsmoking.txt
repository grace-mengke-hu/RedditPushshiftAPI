I went to a disco last night...

With a group of 6 other people, all smokers. The disco full of smoke... everybody smoking. Got half drunk aswell. The desire was there, but i didnt smoke.

It helps a lot to have a firm mindset and focus on not smoking. For those struggeling and having a hard time with temptations... it helps to trust yourself... trust yourself to no have fallbacks.. Do not give in... not one smoke. Not a single one.

Its a thought that helps me through.

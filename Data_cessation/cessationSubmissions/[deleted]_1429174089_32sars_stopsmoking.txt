Quit in the morning of Jan. 1st 2015. And still on going. But beer makes a lot of problems.

So far easy going. First 1 week was hard. The rest easy.
Problem is that i canÂ´t enjoy a beer anymore. As soon as i take 1 sip i immediately want a cigarette. No problems with other alcohols, just damn beer.
Anyone same experience?

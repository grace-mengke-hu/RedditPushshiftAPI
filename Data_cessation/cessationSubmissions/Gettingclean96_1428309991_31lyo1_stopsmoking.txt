Do you actually feel better?

Hi all, have smoked for about 3 years on-off, was on about 20 a day at its worst (end of 2014), and have been on 5-10 since although have had a few days off here and there. I am currently on day 2 clean.

What I would like to ask is do you actually feel physically better after quitting? I'm young which probably helps but I've always felt fine - will I notice a change somewhere along line and suddenly have a lot more energy? What have your experiences been?

I know there is information about benefits of quitting but hearing some first hand accounts would be good. Thanks

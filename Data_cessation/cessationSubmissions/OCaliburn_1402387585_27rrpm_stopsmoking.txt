So I thought I could live without smoking ...

But I think I'm gonna cave. I don't smoke tobacco that much, only when I have a bit of drink in me I'd be puffing like a chimney. I switched from follies to cigarettes 1. Cause they taste nicer and burn faster 2. Because I'd even smoke less of them. On Average one box would last me a week. Some of my friends smoke a box of Rolling tobacco in two days and  others would smoke 2 boxes of cigarettes a day !!!

Basically I've gone cold turkey for the better of two weeks. I had a restless and stressful day u
Yesterday but I managed to hold off. Now I'm sitting on a bus to the coast and I feel the second I the bud stops I'm gonna have to get some john player blues. 

Tell me how long until the cravings go away ?? And is it normal for the cravings to be this bad even if your a light smoker ??? I bought some gum but it's not helping ..

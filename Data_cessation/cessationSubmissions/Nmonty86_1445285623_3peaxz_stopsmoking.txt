70 days smoke free=709 cigs not smoked

Sayy whatt!!  Smoking almost a pack a day since i was 18 and im 29 now, my husband and i quit together.  COLD turkey and ZERO nicotine replacement.  I've read daily on this section and have loved all the encouraging stories! First 3 days sucked but we quit before so had bags of lifesavers candy stashed where our cigs use to be including in the car and we crunched on one each craving.   No one wants to be a smoker, i hated it.. mind over matter. . Best of luck to all you quitting!!

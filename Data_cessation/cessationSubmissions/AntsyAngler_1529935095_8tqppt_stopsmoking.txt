Magic of 4 weeks

I'm in that special time of the 4 weeks badge, which will only last a couple of days before the 1 month badge.  I have to admit, while I don't usually love Mondays, looking forward to seeing another week without smoking accomplished has been a Monday perk.  I'll try to always remember that at least Monday means that I've made it one more week in my life without freakin' cigarettes. 

I'm still having some intense cravings out of the blue sometimes, but they pass really quickly and feel more like little moments of panic over nothing.  I just dismiss them as soon as I identify the feeling and move on.  I know I can do this.  I am a non-smoker folks.

Starting stopping, again, part duex

Second time around, went a month solid the first time, moved back home with my smoker parents and it was the hardest test that I failed.  I was on quit smoking level 2 and I skipped all the way to the final boss, being immersed in smoke 24/7.  

SO here is to stopping again, and hopefully for good this time.  Got my nicorette gum and snacks for days.  Wish me luck...again

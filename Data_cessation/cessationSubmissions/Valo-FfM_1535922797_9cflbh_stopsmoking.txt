33 Days Already!

It´s been 33 days since my last cigarette and I just threw the last one away that was still laying around my desk which I used as a comfort to know that I could start smoking again if I couldn´t stand it anymore not to (which worked for me).

One month was a special goal for me and I reached it and now I´m more than twice as long into not smoking than I´ve ever been since I started smoking.

Doing sports is on my priority list now and I started riding the bike for fun, since I don´t get out of breath or get nasty leg cramps anymore.

The first days of this month of my quit have been incredible easy and are no comparison to the first days of the quit.

It really is worth it and I want to encourage anyone to push through the tough first time.

First Time. 24 Hours In... Thee Possibly Irrational Fears I Have About Quitting

Long post ahead. Also, misspelled "three."

27, spent the last 10+ years smoking (Good ol' drivers' ed). Spent the last month weaning, and had my last cigarette at 13:20 CDT on September 6, 2017. 

So I got through the first day, and I get that it's only going to get harder over the next 3 days. Nonetheless, I feel with the help of Wellbutrin, sunflower seeds, and this stress ball, I can handle the first wave. 

However, I have a few worries about the present and the future (I get that it'll be hell, yet I feel blessed that coffee is not a trigger for me. The newly developed road rage, however, may be an issue).

**Issue One**
*TL;DR:* Smoking has created a schedule, and allowed me the ability to mentally block my day. Should I keep with the schedule now that I've quit?

*Full Text:* My first worry is the entire productivity thing. I've spent the last 4 years at my job going out at 11, 1, and 3 to smoke, and it's become kind of a modified Pomodoro technique in such that I can block out my day into quarters to get stuff done. During the past few weeks, I had been weaning off my intake, and the shift to 11:20/1:40/4:00 became an issue. By the time I moved to a single 1:00 in the last 3 days before quitting, I had already lost my sense of timing, and I'm already having issues getting stuff done. 

Should I still take a 10 minute walk three times a day (it replaces my "lunch"), knowing very well that people have complained about this, and knowing that now I don't have an "excuse"?

**Issue Two**
*TL;DR:* All my former smoker friends have become a-holes to people who smoke. My biggest worry is that I become one of those preachy or passive-aggressive people, catch myself doing it, and end up hating myself so much that I take up the habit again.

*Full Text:* I grew up with a lot of smokers. Some of them still smoke, some of them have quit. 

I feel like the ones who still smoke will be somewhat accommodating, at least in the early stages, but I'm worried about when I join the group of people known as "former smokers." 

In my experience, any time people make a major change in their adult lives, they take on this preachy or passive-aggressive persona (e.g. born-again Christians, CrossFitters, my friends who have quit smoking). 

My biggest worry is that I might become one of those people that will mention how disgusting it is to smoke, or passively aggressively cough at a group of smokers. I don't have many friends left, and if I become that guy, I'll lose the rest of them (the smokers, at least).

I'm worried that the first time I catch myself coughing, I'll become so annoyed with myself that I'll fall back into the habit. Has anyone had this experience?

**Issue Three**
I have a beard. I'm worried I'll end up plucking a bunch of hair out. Should I save myself the patchiness that will undoubtedly come over the next six to twelve weeks of fighting the hand-to-mouth urge by shaving it now?

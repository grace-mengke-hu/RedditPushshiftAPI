I quit smoking today, too.

Today I quit, too.  I can't afford it anymore (I was up to 2 packs a day.)  I lost my job about a month ago.  My g/f is a non-smoker and refuses to move in with me until I quit.  
I've quit about 5 times now ranging from a few days to about 6 months.  I always make the mistake of thinking I could have just one.  Usually when I go out drinking and partying.  This time, it has to stick, though.  It's making me sick, making my dog sick, and my girlfriend hates it. I'm trying to maintain an objective purpose.  A goal.

My problem is that I can't focus on crap when I don't have nicotine in my system.  I can't do a job to save my life.  Currently, since I don't have a job, I don't have to worry about that.  I'm a graphic/web designer by trade.  My work relies heavily on attention to detail.  Something I don't have in my current state.  So looking for a job and detailing my resume and cover letters to fit any particular position is out of the question for the time being.  So I'm going to kick back, attempt to relax, play the hell out of Fallout New Vegas, maybe work on some drawing.

One of the things I've always heard is that one of the best ways to quit is to avoid activities that you used to do while smoking.  Well, for me, that's everything except sleeping.  I'd smoke while driving, playing video games, hiking, canoeing, kayaking, walking, watching movies, drawing, painting, and I confess, even while taking a crap.

This time, I can't make the mistake of going back.  
Any suggestions from anyone who hasn't smoked for years?

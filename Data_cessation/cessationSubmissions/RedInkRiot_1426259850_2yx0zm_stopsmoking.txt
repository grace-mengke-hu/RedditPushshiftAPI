70 hours down and finding new ways to still enjoy "smoke breaks" at work

The last 70 hours have been a roller coaster, as you all know. I was riding high on the enthusiasm of quitting all day yesterday, but this morning I woke up feeling much less excited about things. It's a beautiful spring day and I keep looking out the window from my cubicle thinking, "I'm doing myself a disservice by not smoking on this beautiful day! It would only make this day better!"

Well obviously that's my addiction talking, and I know that. So I told a supportive coworker I was struggling a little bit and she came outside with me for a "smoke free smoke break." We stood where I normally would if I was smoking, we bitched about our boss the same way we always do, but this time I just took deep breaths of fresh air. I tried to emulate the breaths I'd take while smoking, because I thought it might be calming, and it was!

Went inside and sat down at my desk feeling *EXACTLY* like I do after a smoke break - less stressed, more focused, ready to get back to work - but this time I didn't smell nasty or completely fuck over the last 70 hours of hard work to quit!

Just thought I would share. It motivates me to share my story, and maybe this will help someone else who is struggling today!

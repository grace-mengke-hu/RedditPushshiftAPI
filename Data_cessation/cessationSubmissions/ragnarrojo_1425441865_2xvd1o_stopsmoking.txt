Having trouble quitting even with vape

I would love to WANT to quit. I am 32 years old and have smoked for about 15 years. Got a wife and 2 kids that need me healthy. I bought a vape and used like a 22-24 nicotene level. Problem is, its like my brain knows it's not the same as a cigarrette. it's like it craves the crap ton of other chemicals in a cigarette besides nicotine.  So...I found mtself smoking still, and vaping in between cigarettes. Crazy I know. Has anyone else experienced this, and if so, any advice on how to deal with it?

2 months...fuck yeah!

A year ago, I would've totally doubted my ability to completely stop smoking and give up nicotine.  I liked smoking too much!  Or so I thought.  Now, I realize it was more like in Soviet Russia...smoking liked me!  It liked me spending my money, wasting my time, chipping away at my health, keeping me isolated from all the non-smokers.  In the end, there wasn't much in it for me or the ones I loved so I made the decision to quit...but I really only want to ever quit ONCE, if ya know what I mean.  I don't want to stop & then start, fail & try again.  So far, it's worked.

So, if you're on the fence and thinking it's not possible for you to be a non-smoker again, think twice...or thrice.  You can do it!!!

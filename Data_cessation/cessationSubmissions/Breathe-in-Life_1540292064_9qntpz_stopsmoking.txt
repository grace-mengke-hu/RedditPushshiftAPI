Time for self-respect: I extinguished my last cigarette on 11 October at 13:30 after almost 30yrs as a smoker and feel great. Aside from being able to breathe easier I’m amazed at how much more time and energy I have so early on.

Last weekend I set to cleaning and tidying my house and powered through it for hours without a break. I felt good about myself for not smoking and for getting things done. 

As a smoker I’d have been stopping throughout for a smoke and a cuppa and probably got lost in some online nonsense on my phone. I might have gone for little lie down because I was feeling tired. Almost nothing would have got done and I’d have been left feeling dispirited with all the work still to do. It’s not like that today. 

I’m calmer, more focused and productive and not trying to fit my entire day around opportunities to smoke. I don’t miss the agitation of wanting my next nicotine fix. It took stopping for me to be able to see just how much of my life smoking consumed. 

Glad to be living life to the full, free from one more addiction. One day at a time, using all the tools of support available to me.

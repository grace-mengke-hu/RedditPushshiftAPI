I did not buy cigarettes today.

I’m 5 days smoke free today. Cold turkey. I have been avoiding a certain general store close to my house, because it’s where I would usually buy my cigarettes. All the employees know me and usually would have my cigarettes ready to go or at least have the key to the cigarette case ready when they saw me in line. 

I went today, got what I needed and got in line. Got held up behind a couponer and I know I was staring longingly at the cigarettes just behind the cashier like an idiot the whole time. When it was my turn she rang me up and asked me if there was anything else and I said “no” paid and left and that was it.  

I went home and ate the Valentine’s Day chocolates I bought instead. 

Seeing my pack really upset me. My SO smokes, he leaves his lying around all the time, but he smokes menthol and a different brand than I did, and although it’s hard having his around, it was nothing compared to seeing “mine” Seeing my brand, my flavor, and that oh so familiar pack just front and center there made me want to buy it so bad. I’m actually surprised I didn’t cave. I might have, if my daughter wasn’t standing in line next to me. I would of been too ashamed to have her see me buy a pack.

Do not give up.

I know the struggle everyone in this sub has faced. Stay strong and remember cigarettes need you more then you need them. Save your money, save your health, save your senses! I know everyone here is capable of overcoming this ugly addiction. Stay strong and PM me if you ever need anything. God speed to all of the people here strong enough to make the first step.

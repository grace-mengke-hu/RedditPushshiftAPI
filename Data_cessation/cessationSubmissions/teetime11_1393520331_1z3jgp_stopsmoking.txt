Is it possible to eventually be able to have other forms of tobacco in a rare casual/celebratory setting? Like a cigar for a big occasion or hookah?

I have been wondering this recently, because aside from smoking cigarettes which I have not done for 22 days now (and feel amazing about it!), I used to have to occasional celebratory cigar or smoke hookah with some friends once or twice a year. I don't ever want to go back to smoking cigarettes obviously, and I know any tobacco right now is dangerous of bringing me back to a relapse, but I am wondering if eventually it would be possible to have these rare forms of tobacco without it causing a relapse.

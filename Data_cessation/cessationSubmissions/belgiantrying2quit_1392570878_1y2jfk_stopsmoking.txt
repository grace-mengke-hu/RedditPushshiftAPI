Not smoking for 7 days, 18 hours, 9 minutes and 27 seconds

I have quit smoking several times in my life, but now I sort of want to do it for real, let's say without asking for a smoke now and then...
Since I took this decision it feels like it has never been so hard as now!!! The problem also is that I feel like smoking in the evening. During daytime I even don't think about it... NOW I CANNOT THINK OF ANYTHING ELSE !
And I've never seen so many smokers in my life!

Me and my homemate are throwing a farewell party to our schoolmates

We are going to throw a home party tonight because we are graduating. It is my 11th day. My girlfriend smokes like a bloody Turk yet i found it even vitalising for myself for not to smoke. It is not that all my college friends are heavy smokers. Yeah, all 5 of them are heavy smokers. It is the melancholy and the blues i feel makes me want to smoke tonight. 

My girlfriend is smoking one and i don't even have to force my will for not to smoke. It is relatively easy for me when someone smokes around. But tonight, there will be booze and sadness. And i don't want to fight for it tonight. I want to spend my -most likely- last night with my fellas relaxed, with my smoke around. 

When i am sad i want to smoke. And i don't know how to resist tonight. Help me out please. Thanks, in advance. Good luck to all of you.

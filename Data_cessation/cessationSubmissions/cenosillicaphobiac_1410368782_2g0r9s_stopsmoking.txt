When I started

All this talk about money saved had me reminiscing.  When I first started smoking, in 87, I was in the Army stationed in the heart of tobacco country.  The result is I could give them $1 at the PX and get a pack of Marlboro and a nickle back.  One time, as I was preparing to head to the field, I got a whole carton of generics for $5 and it had a 3$ coupon attached.  $.20 per pack.

There was also the time I decided to quit on a field exercise, that was miserable, I ended up paying a dude (who didn't even smoke) $10 a pack for 2 packs.  He would bring a carton to the field as a money making venture.

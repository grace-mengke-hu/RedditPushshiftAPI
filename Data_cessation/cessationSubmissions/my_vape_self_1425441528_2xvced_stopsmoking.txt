My generation had better music.

I am trolling you.  

About six months ago.   I got [this link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocTijYhFP-Y) in my thread.

I honestly don't remember who sent this.  Was it /u/everybody_leaves_if  or was it /u/cenosillicaphobiac  or /u/red5Standingby.  It was not /u/drpinkswife  but she might know.

But we had better visuals.   You guys ready to step it up?

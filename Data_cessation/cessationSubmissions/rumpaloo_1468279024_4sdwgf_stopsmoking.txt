Bachelor Party Success!

Was at a bachelor party over the weekend.  Nothing crazy...we rented a VRBO, drank and played pickleball.  Many of the attendees were casual smokers and had brought a pack for the weekend.  I hadn't mentally prepared to be around people smoking and there were a couple of times Friday night that I thought for sure I would crack

Whenever I thought I was about to give in, I just told my self "5 more minutes, you can do this."  Then after 5 minutes I would do the same.  Using this method really helped me stay strong.  Even if the urge was still there after 5 minutes it was less strong and helped me to keep pushing.

After the first evening I was able to coast the rest of the weekend.

Proud to be at day 111!

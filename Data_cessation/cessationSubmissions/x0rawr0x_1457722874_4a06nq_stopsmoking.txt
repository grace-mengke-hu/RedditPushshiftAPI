I'm on day three. So proud of myself, and so pleased with my current mindset.

So I've tried half-assed quitting before, the whole "I still kinda wanna smoke but really can't afford it so I guess I'll quit". It doesn't last, and I cave.

This time, I was going to the shops to buy more cigarettes, saw the e-cigarettes and had this "eh, fuck it" mentality and got one.

When I get a craving instead of telling myself I can't have a cigarette ever ever ever, I say that I can have one if I feel like I'm about to die without it, but really, to just ride the craving out and see how it goes. Now I'm on day three and the whole thought process of "I want to keep up my streak" is also coming into play.

Walking past people smoking now smells different. I can smell smoke on my jackets, which I couldn't before. My lungs feel a little clearer and when I walk to work I'm not gasping for breath.

I'm feeling pretty damn good. It's early days, it'll get harder, my 'symptoms' will get better. I might relapse, I might not. What will be, will be. And I think this relaxed mindset is what is really helping me this time.

Edit: further thought. When I was a teen I gave up chocolate for lent. It was really difficult, but I succeeded. As soon as it hit midnight for Easter, I excitedly ran downstairs, grabbed my easter egg, and ate the whole thing in one go. I felt really dejected afterwards because I'd been looking forward to it for 40 days, and felt really 'meh' about the situation. That's what I think about every time I think about having a cigarette. It'll be a sense of relief for a few seconds, then the guilt and disappointment will set in. I don't want that.

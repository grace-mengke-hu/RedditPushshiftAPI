The worst part about quitting has been the mornings.

So ever since I quit, when I wake up every morning I feel like I'm having a full blown panic attack. After it subsides I feel normal for the rest of the day but the initial hour of the day when I wake up is absolutely awful. I think I may be feeling this way because the first thing I did every morning was smoke a cig. Has anyone else felt symptoms like this? How did you deal with it?

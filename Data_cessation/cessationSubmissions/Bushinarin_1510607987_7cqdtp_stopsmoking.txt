I fucking relapsed, and I'm mad.

See title.  I hadn't smoked or vaped since June, but I had a particularly bad day and bummed one from a stranger.  I couldn't bring myself to finish it, and I don't ever want to do it again.

I'm just so mad that I gave in to a temporary feeling, and it almost makes me feel like I have no control over my impulses.

I really won't go buy a pack, and I guess I just wanted to vent.  I feel really stupid.

Anyone else having a rough day?  If so, let me be your example.  Don't be like me, haha.

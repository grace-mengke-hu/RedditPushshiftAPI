I'm shedding tears for the first time in a decade

2 packs a day guy here, 10+ years, finally managed 4 days smoke free, every couple of hours I get extremely emotional but I think I have enough power to do this, this is more brutal than anything I've ever experienced. I want to thank everyone on this subreddit for making things easier.

Edit: will have to do something about that old badge lol

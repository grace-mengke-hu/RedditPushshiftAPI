I'm quitting smoking - diary entry, day 0 (introduction)

I hope no one minds me writing here about personal beliefs and reasons. I don't mind if 1000 people or 0 people read this. This is mainly for me.

Why do I want to quit?
First of all I don't think smoking is that great. The fantasy is, but not the reality. I don't like the smell nor the shitty feeling I get when I smoke. It is a drug addiction, nothing more. The only reason why I am smoking is to stop the withdrawal. Anything else is bullshit rationalisation. I'll smoke one right now and describe how I feel about it.

- light up
- that feels good
- the smoke is burning in my nose
- I don't care about smoking my cigarette anymore, no good feelings about it but also no bad ones
- I feel kind of shitty now
- I wish I can finish it already 
- getting annoyed with smoking.
- feeling poisoned
- ugh when am I done with this
- extinguishing cigarette
- I feel kind of bad now.

This is going to be my reminder how a realistic cigarette feels to me.

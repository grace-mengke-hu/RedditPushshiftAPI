Helping my dad stop smoking. Looking for resources, facts guides that I can present to him to begin the process.

My parents have been chain smokers for years. I want to present something to my dad to help him consider stopping. He's 54 years old and works a lot in a stressful environment. His father also died of a heart attack which I'm nervous will happen to him. 

What I'm looking for is something I can print out and show him about why/how/benefits of kicking the addiction. Maybe even other forms of getting his fix.

Any ideas or suggestions? I am pulling sources together myself but anything you guys can point me towards or post will be much appreciated!

Thank you! :)

An idea for an app to help smokers stop

Hey everyone, I'm an app developer and I've got some ideas i'd like to share with, tell me what you think about it.

I think quitting is a hard thing to do, and it's even harder alone. Quitters need a community to reinforce one another in hard times.

1) What do you think about an app that has an `emergency` button you can press whenever you feel a craving for a cigarette and immediately get support from other quitters to help you overcome the craving?

2) Most of the apps i've seen provide nothing more than statistics about your quitting (eg: How many cigarette you avoided, how much money you saved, etc...)
How about an app that tells you when to smoke and gradually tapers the smoke breaks off until you don't smoke at all?

3) All of the apps that have a `community` feature provide nothing more than a simple chat. Do you think there is room for improvement there? How can we build a better more engaging community inside an app?

I would love to hear your thoughts! 
thanks in advance.

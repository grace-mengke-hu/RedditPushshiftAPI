Just quit... When does it get easier?

I just finished up day 4 without smoking, and it is probably the toughest battle I have ever fought. I started a Chantix regimen about two weeks ago and it made it much easier to cut back drastically, but nothing could have prepared me for 0 cigarettes.

I feel a constant anxiety, mood swings and I'm so angry all the time! I'm almost sure my teeth are grinding down to nothing. Tonight I cried my eyes out on my drive home from work because of how frustrating it is and how awful I feel for wanting a stupid cigarette so badly. 

I'd love to hear from anyone who has felt the same and has gone through this as well! If you used Chantix (or did not!), what was your experience like and when did the cravings stop? Any tips or tricks that helped you? How long was it before you no longer thought about smoking?

I sincerely appreciate any insight!!

Update: thank you everyone for your kind words and advice! It really helped to hear from others who have been through the same. It is now the end of day 9 for me, and I know it only gets easier! I hope everyone fighting their own battle the best of luck, hang in there!!

Can't stop smoking ?

I've been smoking about 10 cigs a day since I was 16, I'm now 25. My parents smoke, my friends smoke, my roommate smoke.

Even though I've always known that stopping would be the best thing that I could do to myself, I haven't, in the past 9 years, managed to actually stop for more than 2 months.

I always find the same excuses : "I don't deserve to stop, I'm not good enough.", "I don't have any willpower.", "I'm stressed all the time so it'll make it worse", but these days I can't help but hate myself more and more for how I play games with myself just not to act on it. It just can't keep going like that.

I really REALLY want to stop but I have absolutely no idea how I could manage, so I'd like to ask if you have any tips for me ?

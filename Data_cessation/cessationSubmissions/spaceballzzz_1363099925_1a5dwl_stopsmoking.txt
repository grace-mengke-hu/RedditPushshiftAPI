Ready to quit...

So this is my first time posting on reddit and thought this would be a good first post. I have been smoking since I was 16 and now turning 32 this year. Its time to give it up. I'm at a pack a day now. My SO is buying the patch for me and am going to try that out. I have been on Wellbutrin for a month or so, but don't think its helping any. For whatever reason, I have in my head that I feel like I can't quit. I don't know if it is because I'm scared that if I try, I'll fail at it or what. Any tips on how to overcome this "fear"?

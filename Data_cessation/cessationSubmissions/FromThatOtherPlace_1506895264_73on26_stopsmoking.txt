How Game of Thrones helped me quit smoking.

I quit smoking in 2011 when game of thrones season 1 was airing.

I wanted to be free of this addiction so badly, that I used role play in my head. I pretended I was Khal Drogo during the heavy withdrawal period, and tried to respond to them like he would. He was a total badass in the show, and something like nicotine withdrawal would be nothing to him. So during that first week I convinced myself I was Khal Drogo and I laughed at the withdrawals.

R.I.P Khal Drogo, your strength helped me.

Here we go....Again

I was supposed to stop smoking April 20. Started off fine, got rid of all cigarettes, made it through one whole day....and then started sneaking “just a few puffs”. Hated myself for that! I had told everyone I was done with smoking.So I hid the smell after sneaking ( that is a lot of fast work...lotion, perfume, toothpaste and so on) going for a drive at work to sneak so not seen smoking, rush out for a couple of quick puffs after my partner would leave ( I would be so happy when they had to go somewhere and I would get my moment to sneak) etc. Then the quick fixing for the smell so no one will know. And meanwhile I am hating myself more and more for not stopping and having to sneak.

I have reset quit for tonight at 10:00 pm. I am now pissed off!!! These cancer sticks are not only killing me health wise...but now they are taking my self esteem and making me be something I am not, deceptive. ENOUGH is ENOUGH!!

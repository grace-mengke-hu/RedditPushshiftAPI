Please help me, reddit

It's scary. Because I look at posts like these, and it makes me sad. Because I know I want to stop. I want to with all my heart and soul. But I just can't... It's ironic actually, 3 hours without a smoke and I feel like I'm suffocating. So I have to suffocate myself to stop suffocating. Irony at its best. 

I just don't know what to do anymore. I've tried ecigs, cheap and expensive, I've tried patches and gum, I've tried idly sucking on a straw, I've even tried the Easy Way by Alan Carr. I don't want to be a smoker anymore. It's killing me, it's making me struggle financially, my gf hates it too.. Please help me reddit, I don't know where else to turn.

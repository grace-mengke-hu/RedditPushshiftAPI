Scarred to drink alcohol

Itâ€™s been 2 weeks since I quit which is longer then I have ever gone in a long time. Iâ€™m going to a big party this weekend though and Iâ€™m terrified Iâ€™m going to start smoking. I havenâ€™t drank at all since I quit and I know that alcohol is defined my biggest trigger. Any tips to get past this point? Iâ€™m terrified ðŸ™ˆ

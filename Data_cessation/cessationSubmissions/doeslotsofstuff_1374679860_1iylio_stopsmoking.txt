Day 2, the struggle begins, and I have 3/4 of a patch left

I need some motivation! My half-marathon goal isn't good right now because I fractured my shin bone. I have 3/4 of a patch left. I refuse to buy patches or supplements because I have tried everything, and I remain addicted and end up smoking again.

WHY IS IT SO HARD?!?

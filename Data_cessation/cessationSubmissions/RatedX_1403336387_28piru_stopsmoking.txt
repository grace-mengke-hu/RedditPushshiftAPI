Today is the day

My quit day is today. It has been something that I needed to do for a long time. I quit last year for about 8 months. I started a new job and was getting stressed out and that led to smoking again. I had gotten up to about a pack and a half to almost 2 packs a day. I'm going cold turkey again since the patches and ecigs don't really work for me.

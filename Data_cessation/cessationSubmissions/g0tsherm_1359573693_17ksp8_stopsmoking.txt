Day 3: keeping on keeping on

Day 3 of no cigs is coming to an end, and it feels like its getting harder and harder. I've quit cigs before for one month, with the occasional puff of an e-cig, but after nearly five years of up to two packs a day, enough is enough. Cold turkey; no gum, no patch, definitely no e-cig since that only made picking up a real one that much easier, and from what I hear, the first three days are among the hardest.

Also, I am travelling around Europe at the moment, where smoking is way more accepted than in the US, so I feel like it might be easier to relapse.

One thing I started doing while trying to quell the urge for a smoke was I took a pen while walking around Munich the past couple of days and made a tick mark on my left hand any time I wanted a cig. When I got back at the end of the day, I did ten push-ups for every tick mark. Day one: fourteen ticks. Day two: seventeen ticks. Here's to day three!

Coming up to three weeks; feeling good

As many here, I’ve smoked for a long time, stopped a few times and had many failed attempts. In my late forties now and have never been as determined not smoke as now. I am using patches and that’s ok as I have used them successfully before. I managed all the triggers so far, hardest was at work. Still avoiding social events where I know will be booze and smoking involved. This sub has made a huge difference for me and recommend it highly to anyone addicted to smoking. Thank you all.

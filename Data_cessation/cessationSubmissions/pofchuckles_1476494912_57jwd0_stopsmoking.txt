I have gained a lot of weight

I have been reading online what people expect to gain when they quit and for me I cannot stop. I was 220 when I quit I am now 260.  I didn't care what I eat in the first month as I was quitting at all cost but in the summer I have hiked, played soccer once a week and I am this big and it keeps rising. Is it possible I have another problem caused by quitting?

Huge victory last night.

My last smoke was one week ago today. I've been really impressed how well I've been doing. Just a few cravings here and there, and they were really easy to shrug off. I just tell myself that I don't do that anymore. Anyway, last night my girlfriend and I had some friends over. It was the first time I've hung out and drank with friends since quitting. I was worried that I would break...

...but I didn't! Beyond stoked!

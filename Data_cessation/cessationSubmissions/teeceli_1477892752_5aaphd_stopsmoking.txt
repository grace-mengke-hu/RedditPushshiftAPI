Light smoker for 10+ years with a question

I've smoked 1-2 cigarettes a day (never more never less) over the past 10 years. I smoke mainly because I enjoy it and it winds me down after a hard day at work. I definitely smoke more when drinking. Do any of you have any experience quitting with this kind of habit? I don't think I smoke nearly enough to try the patch or pills or anything. I'm really interested in how you were able to cope with ditching the habit. I can't really "ween" myself off either because there's not really any room to reduce. Also, I realize most people here are much heavier smokers trying to quit so please don't say "Your situation is super easy, just give it up". I am definitely still addicted, maybe not so much to the nicotine, but the habit is definitely deeply engrained. Thank you

**Edit** I've tried vaping as what some people believe to be a more healthy alternative but it didn't really scratch the itch.

2 Days without smoking, no cravings yet... this is going well

or should I be worried? 

I think after watching the Allen Carr '4 Myths of Smoking' Video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgvkSoYGeS4) alongside finally really wanting to stop something that is doing me no good at all, that I can finally live my life without needing a cigarette to keep me happy.

I guess, in the end, the only reason why I needed a cigarette wasn't to relax me, it was only to quell the addiction. That's the truth of it that I ignored for so long, but I don't smoke to relax, I smoke because if I don't I'll call up into a ball like a baby.

That's my take anyway, I'm only 2 days in, and I hope you're doing well on your journey

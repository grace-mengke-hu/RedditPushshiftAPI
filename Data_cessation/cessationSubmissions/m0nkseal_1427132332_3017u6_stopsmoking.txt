24 hours in, thank you!

I posted [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/2zvsxm/has_anyone_tried_quitting_by_gradually_reducing/) yesterday asking how to quit using the easy way. Turns out there is no easy way and the only way to stop feeding the addiction is by completely cutting it off. 

I remembered why I started smoking in the first place. I was depressed and I wanted to kill myself, apparently it doesn't work that way. I had forgotten about it and in the process, made my body a slave for nicotine. 

I woke up each morning with a blocked tingly nose, smoked everyday without giving it much thought because everyone around me did it. After meal smokes became so frequent that they became a part of my lifestyle. 

Only 24 hours after quitting I've realized how bad smokers stink. I don't think any amount of forcing and persuasion by your friends is going to make you quit unless you realize what you're really setting yourself up for. 

I'm yet to grab a hold of Alan Carr's book, and I expect it to be a good read. Thank you to everyone who commented on my earlier post and to everyone who posts their stories here.

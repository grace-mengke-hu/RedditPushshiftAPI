FOUR YEARS!!! My advice: try Allen Carr (again)

With all the e-cig stuff in the news, thought I'd share my cold-turkey success story.  The Allen Carr book was essential, even after a couple of failed attempts with it.  

Also, this year I got my weight back down to the non-overweight BMI where it was when I was smoking (-35 pounds, thanks /r/keto).

You can do it!!!  Hell, you can probably do it better than I did.

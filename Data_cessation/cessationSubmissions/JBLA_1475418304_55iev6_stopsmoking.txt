Still Not Feeling Great

So my first week off smokes was amazing.  I had this great clarity, more energy, and could breathe better.  After that initial boost wore off, I've felt kind of crappy.  Don't get me wrong, quitting has been the best thing I've ever done, but when do I feel better?  

I feel like I'm more short of breath now than when I was smoking a pack a day.  Sometimes I become really aware of my breathing and it seems difficult to do so.  I've had allergy type issues that I didn't have before.

Is this normal?  Part of the healing process?  I would love some input from other quitters.

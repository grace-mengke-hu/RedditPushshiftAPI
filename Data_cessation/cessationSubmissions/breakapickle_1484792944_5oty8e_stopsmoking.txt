On an exercise high!

2 weeks quit celebrated with a 2 mile jog in 17 minutes. Other than the fatigue during the day,  i'm feeling great and it's getting easier to resist cravings. I'm winning every battle against the addicted liar in my head. 

Thought i'd share to keep me motivated and hopefully motivate others that might need it.

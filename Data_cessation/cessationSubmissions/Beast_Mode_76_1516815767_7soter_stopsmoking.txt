I got a cold, but it's not that bad

Every cold I've had in the past 20+ years has been awful.  Like seriously runny nose that just won't stop, congestion that feels like my head is going to explode, extreme fatigue, and just feeling miserable all of the time.  

About a week ago I started feeling a cold coming on, and this was the first cold I've had since I've been a non-smoker.  But it's barely even a cold.  My voice sounds stuffy, and I have a little bit of the sniffles but that's about it. I don't even feel that tired, and I've been to the gym like 5/7 days of the past week.  

Is this what it's like to get a cold as a non-smoker?  Or is this particular cold just not that bad?  I swear I get a cold once or twice a year for like 40 years and I've never had one this mild.  And the only thing different is that I don't smoke anymore.

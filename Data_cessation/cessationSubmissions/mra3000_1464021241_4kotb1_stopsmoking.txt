Made it through Monday morning

This is my second Monday in a row smoke free. One of my biggest triggers is the beginning of the work week. I repeated what I did last Monday (long walk plus hot shower and water water water). The physical cravings are nowhere near as bad - although mentally I am still totally hooked. Staying positive, keeping busy and not letting the addiction have any space or opportunity to grow. Still a long road ahead but I'm not worrying about it. Today I will not smoke.

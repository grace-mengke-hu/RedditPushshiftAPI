20 years of smoking. 6 days into quitting.

I've 'quit' smoking like 10 times. Sometimes for 2 weeks and sometime over 3 months. But now I'm old and I need to get my shit together.

I've got a patch. An app. Wrote a list of reasons to quit and put it in my wallet. I'm sweaty and cranky and holy shit I want a cigarette, but I'm holding in there. Had 2 glasses of wine last night and didn't smoke - which was crazy good.

Anyhow - I'm all in. Full throttle. Givn'r to stop. So thought I'd throw my hat in here. Any tips that aren't drink cold water? - cause that's not cutting it. 

Ok

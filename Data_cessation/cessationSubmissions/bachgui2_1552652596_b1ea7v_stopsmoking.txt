We decided! Stoping "cold turkey" starting monday!

Me and my wife decided to stop together, because obviously is going to be harder for any of us to stop if the other doesn't. We decided to stop starting monday.
Before anyone say that is better to stop right now, we decided for monday because in weekends is when we smoke more, when we're in the house doing nothing that the consumption of cigarettes almost double. So it would be unwise to pass the first days right in the weekend. 
So, monday morning I'm going to "wash" in the sink every tobacco we have in the house, and try to keep up with our lives.
Any advise for us? I think that for her is going to be easier, as she smokes less and she has weed to smoke as well, and i can't smoke weed because of my anxiety problems. 
What things you guys do to help passing the cravings? Any advise will be really helpful!

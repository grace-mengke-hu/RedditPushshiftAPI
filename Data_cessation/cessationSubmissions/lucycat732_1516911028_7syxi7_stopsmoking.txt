Has anyone dealt with gum issues?

Hey guys! 25 days clean today. But I've had a terrible pain in my mouth for about a week, so I visited the dentist this morning. Turns out I have gum recession in a couple spots, and my dentist said it's either from brushing too vigorously or from smoking for 10+ years (or a combination of the 2). 

Has anyone else dealt this this? And does it seem to get better the longer you stay away from cigarettes? It's a bummer that this side effect is coming to bite me in the ass AFTER I've quit, but in the grand scheme of possible smoking side effects, I suppose it ain't so bad.

Made it to the 3 week mark!

First post! Though I haven't posted anything, you all have helped me reach this milestone. I checked this Reddit a lot the first week or two, especially at night while lying in bed craving a smoke. 

It feels like forever ago since I had my last cigarette. A part of me remembers the drags a bit longingly, but the majority of me is so happy I finally did it. I go a whole day without even thinking about smoking, unless I have a particularly stressful moment at work. I even joined a gym last week and have been going 4 times a week. Man, if you wanna smoke just go for a gym session and think of how gross a cigarette would be afterward. It feels good to breathe. 

If you are reading this and you are just starting out on your quit or haven't even begun, know this: you can do it, the way you feel the first few days is not forever, and there is light at the end of the tunnel.

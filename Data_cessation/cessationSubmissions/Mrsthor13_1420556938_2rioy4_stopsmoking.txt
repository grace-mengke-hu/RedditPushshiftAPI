Coughing/sore throat/ headaches.

So I've been a smoker for almost 12 years now and finally decided to quit as my new year resolution. Original right?! Haha well since about day 3 I've been coughing and hacking and plugged up and had the worst headaches of my entire life! And I'm only on day 6! The worst part about all of it isn't really the coughing etc, it's the fact that I've been thinking if I smoke a cigarette I will feel fine! Great logic right? Any tips or tricks to help with the pain and cough? I've tried yea with honey and lemon and some pain relievers (ibuprofen) anything else??? Thanks!

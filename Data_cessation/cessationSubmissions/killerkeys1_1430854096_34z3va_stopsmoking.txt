Hey guys! My group of friends are trying to help one of us quit smoking, and we are going to reward him with 'prizes' at certain milestones. Can you help us think of a list of low-cost but motivating prizes?

I guess I could ask this to any subreddit, but I feel like you guys would be most willing to help with ideas!

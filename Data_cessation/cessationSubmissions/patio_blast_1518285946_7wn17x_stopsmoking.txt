Vivid dreams, brain fog and disassociation [day 3]

To clarify: although this is my third day, my nicotine use has gradually descended over the last few months.  The week prior to day one I was only ingesting 0.5mg of nicotine gum per day, or maybe a few drags of tobacco.  So, effectively, I might be further into the process than the title would lead readers to believe.


At first I was amused by my sense of smell coming back to me.  Also, I was very irritable and anxious.  Those symptoms have mostly disappeared now, only to be replaced with new symptoms: brain fog, vivid dreams and mood swings.


This has made my current life very bizarre â€” I wake up from these dreams only to be uncertain whether it was a dream or not.  Recently there was a super-blue moon or something and I'm not sure if I dreamt that I saw it or if maybe I really did wake up and take a peak out the window to see it.  Last night I dreamt I was riding a vehicle over ocean waves and I figured it might be a dream, but it seemed completely logical to take a picture so that I could show my friends and family once I woke.  So I woke and was disappointed and went directly back into the same dream, or maybe waking was part of the dream.  It's hard to tell.


In summary, I'm experiencing a mix of brain fog and vivid dreams that seem to disassociate me from reality and it is very beautiful and exciting to experience.

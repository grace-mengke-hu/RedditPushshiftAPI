(Yet Another) Day One: Taped motivational scrawls to the apartment walls. What else y'all got?

Deciding to usher in my 29th birthday with yet another "final" break with that lil delicious nico-demon to which we all, at one point, were held hostage, I wanted to get creative with this latest hiatus. Because, persuasive as the health reasons are, I've more or less understood those since I began my smoking career: age twelve. 

Of course, they motivate me still, but in efforts to obliterate my previous quit streaks (the longest stood for 18 months), I wanted to tap the collective wisdom of all you Quitters for more abstract and/or ethical rationale to deal this dragon a Doom of Valyria-era "final" blow.

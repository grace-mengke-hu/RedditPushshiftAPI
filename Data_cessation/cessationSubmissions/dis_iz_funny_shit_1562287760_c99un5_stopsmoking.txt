4 days cold turkey

Never smoked my entire life until about 2 years ago.  Between divorce and other stuff it just happened.  I quit cold turkey a couple months ago then just grabbed a pack of smokes one day and almost enjoyed the process of smoking again.  4 days ago I finally said enough and threw my last pack out in the toilet. Quitting freshly in the morning has always been my thing.

So here I sit 4 days again.  My girlfriend smokes and I worry it’s going to be less we have in common.  Smoking is killing any chance I had at running or going to the gym or any other physical activity.  

I’m tired of having a tight chest and random pains that I always assume are the worst.  Piss on you big tobacco

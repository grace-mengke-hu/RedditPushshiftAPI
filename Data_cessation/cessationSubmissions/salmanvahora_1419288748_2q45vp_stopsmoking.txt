Day 6 here. Been pretty easy. Here is my advice to beat cravings.

Hey Guys! Im at day 6 but I know ill never smoke again. It has been easy and I only experience cravings five times a day. Whenever I feel a crave , i go outside and breathe in large amounts of fresh air. I stay outside for 2-3 minutes and return to my tasks. 

Quick Question: How long was it before you noticed your stamina and breathing during/after exercise improved?

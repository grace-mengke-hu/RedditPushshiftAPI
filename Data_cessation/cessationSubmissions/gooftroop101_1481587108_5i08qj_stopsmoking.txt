Planning to quit soon - any suggestions?

I have been smoking for about 9 years and it's time to stop. I am in the military and they offer a smoking cessation class which I plan on attending after the holidays. I have quit before and lasted about  4 months, after which I went back home between assignments and started smoking again (EVERYONE back home smokes). I'm now in Virginia and have started hanging out with the smoking crew at work and it has just gotten progressively worse. Anyway, if anyone has any advice on what to expect, let me know. I know it's going to be difficult, but I want to do this.

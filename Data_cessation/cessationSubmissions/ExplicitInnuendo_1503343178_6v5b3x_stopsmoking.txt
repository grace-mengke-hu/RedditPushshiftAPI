The time has come.

It's finally happening. Today, the day of the eclipse, is my 40th birthday. And I've decided to give myself the best gift I possibly can. As of midnight tonight, after 15 years of smelling like an ashtray, I'm no longer going to be a smoker. I've waited too long, making every excuse I can to not quit. 'Life's too stressful right now', or, 'I don't want to strain my relationship with my husband, who's also a smoker' 'I only smoke half a pack a day, what's the big deal?'

No. I'm done. I can't let this continue. I won't let this continue.

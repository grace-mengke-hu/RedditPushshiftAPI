How did you do it?

I'm sitting in my car, anxious and worried about my new found attitude. I noticed that I was very short tempered and rude to my family, isolating myself in my room for most of the day. I have a broken ass cigarette sitting next to me in the car. (I crumpled it up last night).

I want to start making healthy decisions and improve my physique. However I'm worried my attitude will carry over into the workplace tomorrow, and the job requires a more than positive attitude (I'm a living instructor for disabled adults). The clients have a much stronger intuition than most  and can feed into my emotions.

How do I go about being happy/less intense through these heavy withdrawals?

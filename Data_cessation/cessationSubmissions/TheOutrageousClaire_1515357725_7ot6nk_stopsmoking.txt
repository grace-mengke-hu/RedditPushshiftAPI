I SUCK AT EMOTIONAL REGULATION

Took off the training wheels last night. Tried to go to the 7mg patches from the 14 and felt like shit. Told myself I'm not going through this bullshit for a third time. This is the last time. Took the patch off. 

It's been 45 days since my last cigarette. 

HOW DO YOU REGULATE YOUR EMOTIONS WITHOUT SMOKING???????????

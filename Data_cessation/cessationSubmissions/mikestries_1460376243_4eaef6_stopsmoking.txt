Want to give up smoking but have no idea what to replace it with?

I really want and need to give up smoking. I've been smoking nearly a year and am becoming paranoid about health conditions; since I started my health has observably declined: I get sick more, flu and colds are worse, I cough like a motherfucker, I can barely walk 1.2 miles from the train station to work without breathing heavily through my mouth and wheezing, I get frequent headaches and I can just generally feel my body degrading.

Problem is I love it, and having a habit that I can fall back on comforts me (it's the habitual nature of smoking that I'm really addicted to, honestly). I gave up cannabis with ease and only smoke every few weeks when I can be bothered to and I've recently cut sugar out of my diet because I've had some dental issues. However smoking is one son of a bitch that I have a serious emotional attachment to.

It comforts me knowing I can have a nice ciggy after lunch,  during an ad break when I'm watching a movie or with a nice glass of red wine. It comforts me knowing that I can dash out of my boring ass job every couple of hours for a quick, stress relieving cigarette that gives me a nice little buzz. What's more, I'm an absolute bastard when it comes to chain smoking in social situations. 

It's reassuring and I've very dependent on it.

So is there anything I can replace it with? I can't bear the though of not being able to leave the office for a smoke, or have something to look forward to with a drink or a meal at a bar. Honestly, the idea of going out and not being able to social smoke or use cigarettes as a way of avoiding conversations with people scares the crap out of me.

If you have any recommendations for what I can do instead or how to tackle quitting it would be much appreciated! Thank you.

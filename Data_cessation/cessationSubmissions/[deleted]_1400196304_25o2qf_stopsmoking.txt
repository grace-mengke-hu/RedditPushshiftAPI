This is getting fucking ridiculous.

I just don't even understand how I let this happen. 

I mean, I do. I understand *how* I'd addicted and *why* I'm addicted. I guess it's more a feeling of disappointment in myself. A grieving sort of feeling. Or something.

I quit drinking almost 8 months ago and never looked back. I've quit cocaine, I've quit pills. I've been able to completely stop abusing lots of substances. Please don't think I'm gloating or glorifying it. I'm not. Of all the things I've *stopped* doing, why do smokes have to be the one I can't?

I mean Jesus. I just feel so entrenched in it. On the drive home from work, I dropped my pack under my seat before I could get one out and had to wait like 10 minutes before I could have one and I was freaking out. I was obsessed. Completely single-minded about having a cigarette. It was strange and kind of alarming. Patches, e-cigs...this is getting fucked up and it's starting to freak me out. 

I want to get that Allen Carr book and I ordered a used one from Amazon but I didn't realize, like an idiot, that I'd ordered it from a company based in London. And so it never made it here and I got my money back and said fuck it and never ordered another one.

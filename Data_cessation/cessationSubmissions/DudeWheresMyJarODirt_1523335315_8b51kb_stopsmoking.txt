I smoked a cigarette, and I’m ashamed.

I found my cat in my yard, dead. He had been hit by a car, and I’m guessing the driver just threw him into my yard. I was really upset, tears and everything. This was what I came home to after spending hours at a local shelter adopting a dog. 

I ended up buying a pack and having one. I’m really ashamed, I hadn’t smoked in three days and thought my craving was finally gone. As I’m sitting here typing this, I’m thinking about going to have a smoke break from work.

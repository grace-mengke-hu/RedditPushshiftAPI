Tomorrow is the big one! Some advice for anyone thinking of quitting..

Hello, fellow non smokers, trying to quitters and not really quit but wanting to be-er's. Tomorrow marks my one year quit (I smoked from age 13 to age 31) I smoked around 12-15 a day and when I drank or roadtripped I smoked a solid pack - two packs. 

I went out one day and bought a vape pen with zero nicotine e-juice and just threw away my smokes (except for one, which I kept in my glovebox of my car, without a lighter or matches) 
Being an anxious person, I decided that leaving a smoke in my car would mean I would have ONE if I was freaking out that I "didn't have smokes" and I wouldn't go buy a new pack. It worked. The vaping was fun and if I shut my eyes and cranked up my tunes, it almost felt like I was smoking. 

I will tell you right now, the best part is not thinking at all about your next one. I run a restaurant and every single person on staff smokes. The servers, the cooks and the rest of management ALL smoke. The NOT wanting to go have a smoke, the NOT being worried about how many I have left, the ZERO stress about if customers can smell it on me or not - is just the best. 

I always thought it would be a lame thing, but holy fuck do I ever love not smoking. 

To any of you out there thinking about it, stop thinking about it and just toss out all your smokes and lighters and just stop. Yup, it'll suck for a few days. Yup, then in like 5 weeks you'll want one REALLY BAD for a whole 30 seconds and it will be really annoying but you won't have one because you're stronger than that. Yup, you'll have dreams about smoking long long after the cravings are gone and you'll be able to taste them and remember how gross they are. 

Just be done, take it from a 18year smoker who LOVED smoking, just be done.

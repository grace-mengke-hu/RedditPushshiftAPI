Wondering if you guys have any advice for someone that's strictly a social smoker.

I've smoked for years and was at one point smoking a pack a day. But for almost two years, I've only been smoking when hanging out with people. It helps cope with my social anxiety and many of my friends smoke, so it makes me want to smoke. When alcohol is added to these situations, that is by far the worst trigger. So I smoke anywhere from half a pack to a pack on the weekends, but absolutely nothing Monday through Friday.

I'm proud of myself for getting this far, but I still *hate* that I smoke at all. It smells terrible, makes me feel like shit physically, and my boyfriend hates it as well.  Any advice?

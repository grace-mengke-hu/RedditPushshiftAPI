In need of perspective. I had quit for 21 days then bought a pack. Now I'm teetering back and forth.

After 21 days of quitting with use of an E-cig, I foolishly bought a pack of cigs after work one night. At first, I didn't really like the cigs but ended up smoking 16 cigs over three days. I destroyed the last four cigs of the pack and was clean for two days. However, curiosity already appears to have killed the cat. With my morning coffee, I thought to myself how delightful a cigarette would be and bought a pack. I've smoked five today. 

At this point, my problem appears not be one of will-power or cravings but rather of attitude. I'm aware of the personal benefits of quitting (long-term health prospects, not smelling, better breathing, etc) but I'm not really motivated by that stuff right now. I don't doubt that I could quit again once I get my fix from the pack but the question will be of my desire to do so. If any better can understand my predicament and has been in a similar place or can otherwise provide perspective, I'd highly appreciate it. Thank you.

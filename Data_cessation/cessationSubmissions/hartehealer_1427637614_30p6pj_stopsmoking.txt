late-blooming irritability

I think my dream was prophetic. I just know that I was cursing people out and exploding with irate emotions in this dream of mine (I don't curse at people when I'm angry in reality) and today marks my first early morning work day/split shift without smoking. That talk of emotional upheavals I've seen, I thought I'd been spared since my first three days were relatively easy to get through but Sundays were grating before; today I'm feeling apoplectic. Just another day to get through.

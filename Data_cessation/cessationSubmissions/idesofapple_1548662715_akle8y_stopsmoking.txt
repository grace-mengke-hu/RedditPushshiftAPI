How do I stop?

Hey guys, I’m at a party, people are smoking, I’m drinking and I really wanna smoke. What’s the point when we’re all gonna die? I struggle with this thought every day. When I’m tipsy I can’t remember why I stopped in the first place. I’ve almost reached a month free of smoking. I only social smoke. Why the hell shouldn’t I?

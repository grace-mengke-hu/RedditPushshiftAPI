Just reset my smiley-star badge :(

I don't even remember why, but I started smoking again what seems like a few months ago, but realistically much longer ago than my brain is willing to rationalize. Somewhere between 6 mo and a year. Fuck, probably longer, who knows.

All I remember is buying a pack and smoking one every now and then, and next thing I knew it was a part of my daily life again. I even started rationalizing not-quitting again until recently.


I recently moved from the middle of nowhere to a large city where I actually have neighbors. I don't have a garage anymore so there's no indoor smoking area. I *could* step outside to smoke, but it's inconvenient enough for me to put it off. I guess being super lazy has at least one benefit. I developed a light cough after a couple weeks here and realized my lungs were starting to get rid of that crap since my smoking had basically been cut in half. I knew what I needed to do.

No Chantix this time, just plain old cold turkey. The timing worked out, I smoked my last cigarette at 2pm yesterday, a week before my birthday. My first goal is to not let myself down so I can see that 1 week badge notification pop up on my birthday at 2pm. I've done this before, I can do it again.

**Tl;dr:** Not one more cigarette, not one more puff. I took that mantra for granted once, hopefully I will be mindful enough to have learned my lesson.

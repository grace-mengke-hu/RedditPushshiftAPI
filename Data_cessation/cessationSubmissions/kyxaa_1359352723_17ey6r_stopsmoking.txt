Thank you Allen Carr for allowing me to see what I've been doing to myself. I wrote a short tid-bit about my last cigarette.

As I smoke my last cigarette, I feel the paper between my fingers. Paper that contains the drug that has had it's grip on me for almost 4 years. With one hand, I roll the paper tube to loosen the material inside so I can watch the drug fall from it and disperse with the wind, I hold one of it's brothers in the other hand, burning and producing something that I have allowed to enter my lungs for so long, smoke. As I watch the poison fall to the ground, I can't help but to notice how fragile the dried leaves are as they become nothing but insignificant pieces of trash. This trash, that I've allowed to control me for much too long. Once I am confident that the paper in my hand is nothing but a piece of paper containing no more poison, I flick it away from me, and grab the next of its kin to do away with in the same manner. I put it's flaming brethren to my lips and inhale, tasting the awful taste that I have forced upon myself with no obvious gain to myself. I feel how the smoke fills my lungs, a feeling that I've craved, is now perceived by me for what it is, suffocation. I finally empty the package that I've seen too many of, littering my living space, filling my trash cans, emptying my wallet, and think, "What a waste." I take my last inhale of the deadly drug, flick the ember with the hand that just did away with the other carriers of poison and know, that I am now free.

Acceptable amount of time to smoke occasionally again?

I haven't smoked in 30 days, and I feel relatively good about it.

I know this is probably a bad idea but has anyone had any experience with smoking on occasion after quitting and being successful with it (i.e. not buy multiple packs a week again). Is it possible to have a cigarette a week or even 1 every two weeks and not get right back into it?

How do you take your mind off of it?

What's going on r/stopsmoking ?

I've been smoke free for five days after a five year addiction (which started freshman year in college). Previously, I was smoke free for four months. 
I used cinnamon toothpicks from a local food co-op and a ton of shit fuel (coffee). 
After I graduated and the stress got heavier, I got back into the habit. 
I want to quit for good this time. 

Toothpicks with coffee was my little trick, what was yours r/smoking?

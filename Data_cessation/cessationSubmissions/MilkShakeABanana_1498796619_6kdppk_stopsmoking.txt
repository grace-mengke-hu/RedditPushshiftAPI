2 days in and getting pain in chest.

I went to the doctors and he said that it's something a lot of people quitting smoking feel and should last up to 2 weeks. When he listened to my breathing he said everything sounds normal but i'm going for a blood test on Monday to be safe. Still kinda worried.

Here's my accumulated wisdom on quitting, relapse and staying quitted.

Hey people! Ive smoked weed and cigarettes for 15 years, quitted many many times, to a point where people laughed at me when I declared to have quit. In 2016 I quitted, in 2017 I ran a full marathon. I'm at a point where I cannot imagine smoking again and don't care when people smoke around me. Yes, I realise it’s just a couple years and even I am not yet out of the woods. However, here's my accumulated wisdom on quitting, relapse and staying quitted. It's from personal experience, stuff from various quitting methods, what I've heard from others and a bit of psychology/addiction theory. This is mainly about smoking not about weed. And about quitting without substitutes like vaping or patches.

**1) While you're addicted, you're never ready for it (or whatever that means). You have to make yourself ready for it.**
Don't wait to be ready for it, or to be sick of the addiction. You don't know when that happens, maybe never. Instead, while you smoke start to see tabacco for what it really is: *a product that is designed to sneakily keep you addicted, to extract money from you and eventually kill you, and in the meantime reduces quality of life*. Yay...
So instead of waiting to get ready, you have to make yourself ready for it.

First of all read up on what is in tobacco. You won't be able to know everything because the tobacco industry keeps it a secret what is in there exactly. Here's [a bit of info](https://www.compoundchem.com/2014/05/01/the-chemicals-in-cigarette-smoke-their-effects/), read it carefully. Also realize that this is a product designed to keep you addicted: the industry puts extra stuff in there that is addicting, and the industry engineered the cigarette in [such a way that you get more addicted](https://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/content/11/suppl_1/i40). Last but not least, take a good look at what [you get in your lungs in a month of smoking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HD__r66sFjk). All this is important because you need to get rid of the romantic idea of what that cigarette is. It's time to see what it really is, and see what it does to your body. Take the time to watch and read about, and while you smoke, take a good look at your cigaret from up close. Listen to the crackling sound when you inhale the smoke. Take a whiff of smoke from some burning plastic or a fireplace. Do you enjoy that? Ofcourse not! You probably cough or feel sick. You only like the smell of cigarette smoke and inhaling it because there are addicting chemicals in there and it became a habit. You don’t cough from cigarette smoke because there are chemicals in there that suppress your cough reflex. Inhaling smoke is not natural, this smoke is engineered to make you forget that.
Don’t skip this phase ‘because you know smoking is bad’. Really take your time to read up on what’s in a cigarette, how it addicts your mind and the industry created a sophisticated product that is designed to keep you addicted. 

**2) Analyse your addiction**
An addiction is never just the request of your body for a substance. Especially the smoking addiction is connected with many more aspects of life: you smoke at certain places, with certain people, at certain moments. You might feel like smoking more when you’re tired, hungry, emotional or drunk. Try to recognize for yourself when, where, with who and why you typically smoke. These are things you should remember as risky situations. These are circumstances that your brain has connected to the smoking habit
Also try to think which cigarettes you TRULY enjoy and which are just an “*in between because I have to keep my nicotin levels high*” cigarettes.

**3) list your pro’s and cons of smoking**
Have a sheet of paper and note down all the pro’s and cons of smoking. Divide them in short term (less than a week) and long term. Be very honest here. Dont have to note everything in one go. You can come back to the list later and add things. Here’s [some inspiration](https://www.verywellmind.com/the-pros-and-cons-of-smoking-2824462).

A question on the advantages of smoking: did you need or experienced these advantages before you started smoking?
Many advantages of smoking are related to *getting rid of the withdrawal symptoms of smoking*. In other words: they are only a positive because you are addicted to smoking and the negative that is negated is caused by the addiction. 
With this list do two things: convert all the cons into positive phrasings and note them on a small cheat sheet. (e.g. change “I taste less” &gt;  “I’ll taste more”, “my breath smells bad” &gt; “My breath smells much better”, etc). Also note 2 or 3 things that really motivate you to quit. This is your cheat sheet you keep with you for the rough times.
On another sheet try to come up with other ways to achieve the pro’s of smoking. E.g.: It makes me relaxed: what other things make your relaxed? It keeps me thin: how else can you lose weight?

**4) Time to quit!** 
Ok, so by now you have learned what cigarettes really are, you know more about your addiction and you’ve got a cheatsheet with your reasons to quit. This was to make yourself ready, instead of waiting to get ready (never).
For me the hardest times where the first two/3 weeks. They say 3 days, 3 weeks, 3 months and 3 years are all crucial times you have to go through. Anyway, the couple most successful quits, including this one, for me have been when I *cheated* the first two weeks.
Either I got really sick, so bad that I didn’t want to smoke or I booked a vacation to some place where I was unable to smoke (hike in the mountains, very hot climate I then dislike smoking). This made the first two weeks much easier. So that’s what I recommend you: if you get sick or are unable to smoke in your home-environment for some reason, then grab the opportunity and just decide after some time that you’ve quitted smoking. Or plan the vacation trip in the outdoor for 2 weeks, then you can pick the date yourself.
I didn’t do anything special the night before, just went to sleep and when I got up I tried to not make it very special. Ok I’m done with smoking, today is the first day of a new life! Let’s go do outdoor stuff.

Now we’ll get a little bit psychological, but these things certainly don’t hurt, and I believe do help.


1) Don’t take this lightly. You’re working on a HUGE change in your life and have decided to quit. Be very serious about it to yourself and promise, that you really do give it your best BEST.

2) There’s no “just 1”. One cigarette immediately activate the entire addicted system in your brain. Just 1 cigarette makes it MUCH more difficult.

3) Don’t say to yourself “I’ve quitted smoking”, instead turn it around to a positive: “I’m so glad that I’m losing this addiction.” Don’t think “quitting is hard”, instead think “I’m getting so much from this! [*grab your cheatsheet and reread all the positives that you are gaining*]”. Also actively enjoy the benefits: smell the fresh air, taste the food, kiss your partner/kid without hesitation, buy something nice with the gained money, start working out. Celebrate your new, much better life! And realise that it takes just 1 cigarette to blow it all.

4) Especially the first period you’ll have to support yourself by not going to places/people or do things that you used to do when smoking. You can do that later when you are further away from the addiction, not in the first phase. If that's not possible, then realise that these places/people/activities will give you cravings.

5) Allow yourself to quit the quitting, but not on a whim. There will be times where your will to quit is overshadowed by the cravings. You may smoke, but not in the next hour. At least wait out the hour, and honestly since you’re about to throw away all those positives and your process, wait until the next day. If you still want to smoke, then go ahead.

6) Don’t get into a discussion with the [still] addicted part of your brain. You will get cravings: physical unrest or thoughts that explain why it is a good idea to smoke. **This is not you** that wants to smoke, this is the *addiction* that is panicking and tries to lure you back in. Try to look at it like that: *that pathetic addiction crying and kicking, coming up with short term nonsense trying to make you think that you want to smoke*. How cute… you know better and reread some of your cheat sheet reasons to remain free. The fact that you’re going through cravings means that you are making progress. Be amazed about your brain spouting this nonsense (*you’re a grown man, you can decide if you want to smoke, buy them!*, *lets have some well deserved me-time*, *there’s no better time than smoking and gaming, you know it!*, etc), feel sad that your brain has been enslaved for so long, be happy that these cravings pave the way to freedom. These cravings get less severe over time. Now go do something productive and you will feel euphoric that you won that battle.

**5) Relapse**
I’ve relapsed many times over the course of ~5-6 years. So often I fell for the trap: *things are going great! Quitting is easy! I’m so far away from my addiction, I’m a new person*, *maybe I can be a partysmoker*. At first it was exciting to be quit, but the will to quit slowly fades while addiction can take years and then at some moment you no longer look at you cheat sheet and then there’s that moment where you’re caught off guard: heavy emotional state, alcohol, or some other “good” reason. Hint: it’s never a good reason, it’s just a moment of weakness where you forgot HOW IMPORTANT AND BIG IT IS WHAT YOU ARE DOING!
Ok, so you smoked one cigarette, probably tasted good, because it’s engineered to tickle your addictionsystem and that tells you “yeaaahhhh gooood”. Or maybe it wasn’t good. And what a surprise, either way, *you don’t feel like smoking another one at all*! So you can smoke just one! So you have become that partysmoker! So you can just keep it at one or two cigarettes when going out. So I am stronger that nicotin, haha! Fast forward 2-3 months: you’re back to full time smoking again…
So if you slip and do smoke a cigarette, then treat it very seriously. Regard it for what it is, a disaster that has put you back A LOT. You have to get back at it 100% again and maybe you’ve dodged a bullet.
Oh and one last thing on relapse: you’re never actually happy about having smoked again the day after. Never. On the other hand you’ll feel euphoric the next day when you felt weak, but decided not to do it.

**6) Remaining quit**
After the first euphoria of making it for longer than a couple months you have to remain motivated. First of all remain very cautious and realise that there really is no good reason to start smoking again. Perhaps helpful to some: promise yourself to NEVER again bring your hand with a cigarette to your mouth, no matter what. It’s that simple, really.
What really helped me was taking up sports. I’ve had a relapse while training for the marathon. I immediately felt I could no longer run 10km in one hour. True or not, if I wanted to run that marathon I had to remain quit. By now I do other sports and condition-wise cannot afford to smoke. And I know 1 cigarette means the end of all that I have gained.
Find something for you that is worth a lot to you that is directly affected by smoking: saving for something special, not getting cancer like uncle bob, your kids, whatever.

**Some myths about smoking:**

* *I had an uncle who turned 96 while smoking, and I know a vegan that never smoked who died of lung cancer*.

Yes, that’s possible. But think of it like this: Life has a lottery, the Cancer Lottery. It has many prizes where you get some kind of cancer that you’d rather not win. Unfortunately we all play in the lottery with some free tickets while we grow older: spontaneous mutation? +1 ticket. Living in a city? + 1 ticket/day. Live next to a highway? +1ticket/day, etc. Smoking? +1 ticket for every cigarette you smoke. Some people play the lottery with just a couple tickets and win the jackpot, some people play the lottery with tons of tickets but never win anything. Do you want to significantly increase your chance to win some kind of cancer?

* *I’m a free man. If I want to smoke, then so I shall. I’m not the person who is told what to do, you know?*

You’re not a free man. You’re a slave of the tobacco industry. Every day you must go to the story and buy cigarettes or else you get anxious. Every time you buy cigarettes Philip Morris and sons thank you, the useful idiot, from their private island with their pools and helicopters.
Look around you and see what kind of people smoke. So often they are coughing, smelly, ugly poor people. Do you want to be one of them? You might be strong now, but wait another 10 years and you’ll be a coughing, smelly, ugly old person. 

* *You only live once. I rather die at age 60 while having lived a grand life, than die at age 90, alone, and with parkinson.*

There are several problems with this. First of all your overall quality of life is worse: less money, less taste, less smell, less condition, more often ill, people who don’t like interacting with you because of the smell (from your mouth that you don't smell). So the overall quality of life is worse.
But also the non-smoking 90 year old probably lives a healthy life, then gets sick at some point and dies, usually within the span of a couple years. The 60 year old smoker dies after years and years of sickbed, or some really unexpected cancer. And take my word: 60 looks far away now, but at age 60 you would love to have another 20 years!

* *One last anecdote that motivated me*

So I used to frequent a bar where the barmaid was a heavy smoker, like most of us. Lets call her Kelly. I did not fancy Kelly as she wasn’t my type and to me unattractively overweight. She then quitted smoking, good for her. Then after 3 month or so, Kelly came to work, and she looked different! She had a healthy, vibrant look! I still didn’t really fancy her, but she gained 2 points on a ten points scale easily! That’s what also kept me focused: *do this at least 3 months and live a new, healthier live and be like Kelly, you can do it man*

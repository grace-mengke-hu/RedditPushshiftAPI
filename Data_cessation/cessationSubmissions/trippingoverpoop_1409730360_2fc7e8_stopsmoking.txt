First day down.

I put all my leftover cigarettes in a jar of water to sit and soak so if I ever had a craving i would have to take one out and let it sit forever to dry out which my craving would end and is put it back in the jar. I've been a bitch. I looked everywhere here for candy cigarettes just to have something to use for a oral fixation but they are nowhere. I could use some advice I have a job interview tomorrow and have bad nerves to begin with. What do you guys do to calm down ?

Trigger Conquered: Car Breakdown

So, my car's alternator took a big fat shit this morning. First the speedo and tach went out, then the ABS, the lights dimmed, and finally there just wasn't enough juice for the spark plugs.

I pulled into a market's parking lot, which has about 5 spots total. In my frantic 'get this fucking thing of the road' state, I managed to take up two spots. I am an ass.

I have pens on me, so good, I can write a note. Frantically, I flip through my glove box for paper; any piece of paper. And what falls out? That half a pack of American Spirit Blues that I thought I had thrown out.

I stuff those bitch ass cigs in my pocket, write a note stating what had happened to my car, and that I'll be back later for it.

I call my co-worker, for I know that he'll be driving by soon, and that way I can grab a ride the rest of the way to work.

I get to work and call the market after they have opened to explain the situation to them. They tell me no problem, just come by after work and get your car.

Upon arriving to my work area after the morning set up, I notice a different co-worker of mine is a bit stressed. I pull out those American Spirits, and throw them at him. He gives me a hi-5, covering both the fact that I haven't smoked in 8 days, and that he just came up on half a pack.

Here's to healthy futures.

Edit: sentence structure.

Update: I fixed my car after work. Swapped out the alternator for a new one. Gotta love warranties. Car is now strong as bull.

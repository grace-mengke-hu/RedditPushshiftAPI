Just had my last one

Really hoping this is it for real. I'm sick of smelling like crap. I'm sick of not being able to enjoy social situations. Sick of running outside after a meal to truly finish the meal. And of course I'm sick of choking myself every day just to feel normal (thx Mr. Carr) 

Hoping no praying this is it. Any words of encouragement from those who are further along this journey than I would appreciate. 

Love the positivity in this sub and helping others quit. Thanks!!!

200 Days in and a coworker who smokes, that's been making fun of me, finally asked for help.

Right, when I quit I had a coworker I used to smoke with always kinda make fun of me or poke fun at me. I didn't pay any real mind to it as I was prepared to quit and had the holy book of Alan Carr to back me up.

Anyways, yesterday, as I was leaving the office he would normally give me a "hey! want your dreams to come true! I got a smoke right here!" and instead he gave me this look like "man, I need help."

&amp;#x200B;

We ended up talking for like 30 minutes and he thanked me. He wants to quit this next upcoming vacation the office has, kinda as I did over 6 months ago. He quit for 5 years before, but picked it back up 2 years ago, so I know he can do it.

I'm curious to see how he comes out. I offered my continued help, if he so chooses.

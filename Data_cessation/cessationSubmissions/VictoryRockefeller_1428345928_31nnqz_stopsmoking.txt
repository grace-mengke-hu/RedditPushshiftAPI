I just had my last cigarette!

After spending the best part of the last seven years (since I was 16) on 20 a day, I have officially had my last cigarette. I wasn't even planning on quitting today but I stumbled upon this subreddit by accident, and a fair few posts mentioned Allen Carr's EASYWAY book so I spent this afternoon reading an online publication of it and... Well here I am!


I kicked the habit for a few months last year and I'm looking forward to getting back my sense of taste and smell!


Goodbye 'Windsor Blue Superkings', you were disgusting.

Anyone else struggling with an obsessive overthink of a smoking cessation plan?

I tend to be quite obsessive with planning behavioral changes. And when it comes to quit smoking, I feel like I'm overthinking it. Thinking about quitting makes me very anxious, and designing my 'plan' reduces that anxiety, while not actually having to deal with abstinence itself.

I spend hours and hours researching all kinds of things to "be prepared". From how to develop coping skills and strategies to deal with emotional triggers to how I should approach the smoking behavior in the last days of being a smoker.

But I feel like the "kickstarter" itself is missing, I never feel "ready". Anyone else feel or felt like this?

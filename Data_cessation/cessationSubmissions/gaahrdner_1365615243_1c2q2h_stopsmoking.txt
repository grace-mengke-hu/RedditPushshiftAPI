You CAN do this!

Hi quitters!

I just wanted to take some time to let you all know; you can do it. As a smoker for 12 years, working up to about a pack a day (many many more when drinking!), if I can do it, so can you.

Today marks my 1 year anniversary, and I'm pretty excited about it. It was not easy though; I tried nearly everything under the sun.  I read Allen Carr's book, and it didn't work for me.  I tried the patches and they didn't work for me. Same with the gum.  I went on Chantix and, while it worked for a bit, the side effects nearly killed me one depressing day on the highway, so, that didn't work.

I've lost count of how many false starts I've had, but if I had to guess I'd say it's easily above 50.

But, I did manage to quit smoking, and cold turkey even.  Looking back, I found that the key (for me at least) was that **I finally, truly, did want to quit**, and there was no turning back at that point.  There was nothing left for me to do but quit! So I picked a day sometime in the future, thought about it on and off, enjoyed my time until that day and then just quit.  All my other quits failed because my mental state was not one of me actually desiring to quit.  This probably sounds hokey to some, and maybe it is, but I wanted to share.

For those of you quitting; it will get easier, I promise.  There will come a time when you won't even think about cigarettes anymore.  It's not all roses of course; that "pull" never truly goes away, it just gets extremely weak to the point where it's not even a regularly occurring thought. And then you don't even think about cigarettes at all, except for that random Tuesday once every 2 months, and then that fleeting thought is gone once again.

It is so, so worth it.

I wanted to let you all know I'm rooting for you. You can do it!

Let's do this

So I've just done the hardest part, telling my smoking SO I'm quitting. I figured I would stop when I finished the pack and a half that I have left, but part of me is saying screw it just do it now.

 I started smoking when I was 12 and I quit for 7 years while I was having children. Two years ago, I was trying to lose weight, and did lose a lot of it, but instead of putting food in my mouth I stupidly put a cigarette in there instead. And I wasted thousands more dollars in smoking again.

I want to be able to spend money on other things, like the tattoo I've wanted for years. I want to not smell like cigarettes. So, bottoms up, here's my last one.

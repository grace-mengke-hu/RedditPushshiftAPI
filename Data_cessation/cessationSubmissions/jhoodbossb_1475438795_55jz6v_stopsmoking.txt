I want to buy the book written by Allen Carr but...

Hi,

I am currently living in Seoul for 4 months. I want to quit smoking and I want to read the book by Allen Carr to help with that. I look up the book on Amazon and I find it has 272 pages: https://www.amazon.com/Allen-Carrs-Easy-Stop-Smoking-ebook/dp/B0051XSN50/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1475438611&sr=1-1&keywords=stop+smoking

Then I look around on the internet and the top hits are pdf's with 100 or so pages. Why is it so much less? Why are the pdf's so easily available without copyright infringement? I would like to buy the physical book but since I am in this new city (I'm European) it's going to be hard to get it.

Hope you can help me out!

Cheers

Im better than you, cigarettes.

Dear cigs,

Fuck you. I hate you. I wish you never existed. Im above you, better than you, and i no longer need you. You are nothing to me. You smell nasty, taste like shit, and just plain ugly. As you fall into the garbage in pieces, remember that i wont miss you.



Without love,
Wolfy



So today is the day i quit cold turkey. I cant take it anymore. I feel like crying everytime i smoke or think about it. I feel so guilty... i believe its time to quit, right?

Sorry for the cheesy post. Im just so ready to quit. Ive smoked for 6 years, 5 to 7 a day.

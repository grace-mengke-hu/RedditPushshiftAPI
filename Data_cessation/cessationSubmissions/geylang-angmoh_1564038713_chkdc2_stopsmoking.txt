An infection reassured me that I made the right choice

So I had a bit of a cold recently, nothing serious, no full blown fever, no taking any medical leave or much pills. I pulled through just by drinking more water and strepsils.

When I was a smoker, an infection like this would scale up to a two-week episode of tonsillitis, high fever, maybe 2 or 3 courses of antibiotics and other pills, and I would really need to take time off work for recovery.

Instead, it was just a minor inconvenience and I’m back on track. With cigarettes, my immune system was considerably weaker, I definitely had higher risks of complications, and I can really feel the difference.

Thanks for all the support of this sub, I am at my second month now, and deleted the app. Wasn’t using it much anyway, and I am sure I won’t need to reset the progress date ever again. Not another puff, stay savage!

Joined the 100 Day Club

Totally missed my 100 Day mark!! I'm truly thankful for this subreddit, and all the great advice and the people I have commiserated with!

Despite emotional drop-off, I have started making healthier choices in life BEYOND quitting smoking.... but it has all started here. ðŸ˜‰

Much love to my fellow quitters! Get away from that nicotine, and on to a better life!

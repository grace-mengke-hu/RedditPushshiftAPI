It was my 100th day in smoke-free life. But i've smoked one 10 minutes ago.

Hello quitters and people who want to quit. I've quit smoking 100 day ago. I've had really bad finance and i realized i only could run for 10 minutes or less and i decided to quit. But only after 100 day, today i bought a package smoked one. 

I'm a little deppressed these days i also started to drink again. Still sober but it doesn't matter...

edit : I'm smoking since i was 15 y.o. i'm 21 now.

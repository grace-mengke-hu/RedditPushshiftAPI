Day 3 and freaking out. Any advice?

Hey guys,
This is actually for a good friend of mine. I quit smoking at the beginning of the school year (September) and I've been going decently strong. (haven't bought a pack, but have an occasional cig with a friend). However, my friend has decided to quit completely. Cold Turkey.  He was a pack+ a day smoker, and has a history of addiction issues. He is currently 3 years clean and is working towards his degree in drug and alcohol counseling. 
He has been reaching out to me for some advice on quitting (although with an occasional cig, I don't think its fair for me to say I completely quit). He enjoys smoking, loves the taste, the smell, the ritual. Coffee and a cig once he wakes up or else he can't function. 
I told him to chew gum, lollipops, anything to get his mind off of it. But with school starting back up, and him working 12 hour shifts on the weekends being surrounded by smokers its proving to be tough.
Sorry for the wall of text, but any advice? Thanks! 

Tl;dr: Friend LOVES smoking but wants to quit. Advice?

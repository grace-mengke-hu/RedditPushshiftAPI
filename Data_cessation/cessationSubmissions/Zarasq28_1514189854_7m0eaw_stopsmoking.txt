Struggling a little bit

Is anyone else freaking exhausted? Like, all the time? I'm on day five of my quit and for the first few I was using my vape but got very drunk (Ozzy O level drunk...it was my birthday) and left said vape somewhere in the pub I think. Since then, I've gone cold turkey and it's been a bit of a struggle but I'm doing it. I'm just feel like I've never been so tired I'm my whole life. It makes sense as there's no more nicotine left in me but can anyone tell me when this stops? 

Also, Merry Christmas everyone!  Xx

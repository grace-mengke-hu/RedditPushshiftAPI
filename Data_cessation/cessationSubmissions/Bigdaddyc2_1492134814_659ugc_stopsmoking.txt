New born non smoker

I'm on day 4 of non-smoking!  Cravings are strong when I drink coffee, alcohol, drive get stressed, make the kids lunch lol pretty much all the time!  I downloaded this quit smoking app that track a bunch of different things, actually pretty cool. This is one of the things it told me to do, so here I am:) went to watch the Edmonton oilers playoff game last night with a bunch of drinks and I stayed strong!!! Every time The cravings get really bad I say the name of my wife and kids out loud and take a deep breath and it seems to pass.  I have smoked for 18 years and have quit before up to 6 months and have went back.  I really want this for myself and my family!  Saving up for a Lexus should have one have one in about 18 years lol

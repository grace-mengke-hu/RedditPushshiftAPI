2 months cold turkey

I am 2 months smoke free today. I have done it cold turkey. Its been exceptionally tough and I had the resurrection of horrific cravings last week but I have got to this stage without one puff. I am so proud that I have done it as all my friends smoke but the benefits of not smoking far outweigh having one.

I have started running doing couch to 5k
I now smell other smokers and think "jeez did I used to smell like that"?
I have so much more energy
I now don't have trouble breathing or get out of breath
I have saved money
I haven't had to stand outside freezing my ass off just to have a cig

Just one thing to sort out now and that is I just can't stop eating crap. I know that I'm compensating for not smoking and it's the lesser of 2 evils and will deal with that in good time.

I class myself as a non smoker now rather than a former smoker üòÅ

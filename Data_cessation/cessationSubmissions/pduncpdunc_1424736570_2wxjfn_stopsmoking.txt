Set my quit date for March 1st. What steps should I take to ensure that I fully succeed this time?

I have smoked about a pack a day for around a decade now and have tried to quit multiple times, with my longest hiatus being around 3-4 months. I would really like to quit smoking cigarettes for good this time, and I think I have put off trying to quit for a long time because I am afraid to fail again. 

I set my quit date for March 1st and do not want to smoke cigarettes after that date. I plan on buying nicotine gum and an e-cig to help me stop and cope with my triggers (as this has been relatively more successful in the past) and to try and cut back how much I smoke up until that date so it's not so cold-turkeyish (which is relatively less successful for me).

I am a musician and tour frequently, and I worry that my lifestyle is very conducive to being around smoking (long drives, lots of hours at bars and venues with lots of smokers, and being around lots of friends who still smoke). If I can't eliminate being around places and people that are triggers, how else can I cope with them? How can I better prepare for successfully quitting for good? What methods have you find to be personally effective for you? For those who have quit but relapsed, what techniques helped you quit for longer and what caused you to relapse? I appreciate anyone who takes the time to try to help!

TLDR; Imma quit for good this time; advice?

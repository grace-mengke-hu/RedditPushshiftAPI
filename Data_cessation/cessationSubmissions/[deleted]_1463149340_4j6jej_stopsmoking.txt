Do people really quit?

My husband has tried or at least pretended to try while lying to me and sneaking around behind my back several times. He doesn't seem to really want to quit. Because of all the deceit, I grow more and more resentful and less and less attracted to him. Is there any chance he can actually quit or am I fooling myself by continuing to hope for it?

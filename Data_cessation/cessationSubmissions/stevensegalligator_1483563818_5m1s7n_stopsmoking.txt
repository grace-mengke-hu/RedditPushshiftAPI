4 days in with questions.

Quitting as a new year's resolution and trying to make it a permanent change. A little background: 4 year smoker, about 2-3 packs a week, more when stressed. 

Former smokers, what gave you the final push? 

How do you avoid the weight gain (I mean obviously exercise but more foods and eating habits to avoid)?

What were the biggest "humps" to overcome? For me in the past its been 3 days, 1 week, 17 days and then I usually feel much better after that. 

I'm in grad school and as the work load piles up I get more and more tempted to indulge. Any student suggestions? 

Thanks for the help r/stopsmoking!

This sense of smell is redonkulous!! and a quick question about some body responses to quitting.

so it's been 4 days since i stopped smoking. today while i was driving, i asked my sister if she put a new freshener in. she said it's the same one that's been in there for a month, and she requested that i change it cuz the car was starting to smell stale again. i told her she was crazy cuz that air freshener smell was strong. she said i was crazy cuz the smell is almost dead. so crazy how my sense of smell is coming back and it's sensitive to a lot of different smells i never smelled before. (so much smell)

next, went to gym today for first time ever without smoking. let me tell you, i couldn't work out very much.  I ran way too fast on the treadmill. my lungs were feeling great, and i wasn't out of breathe. unfortunately, my body isn't used to utilizing this much oxygen, and i actually felt kind of nauseous. decided to just end my workout with a run so i don't over do it.  

also, this question is kind of gross. but has anyone seen an increase of phlegm the first couple days? like i spit out some huge pieces of nasty shit in the morning, bigger and nastier than the ones i spit out while smoking. however, they are a lot less constant and really clear my airways and sinuses. also, anyone else kind of had the runs? idk if it was something wrong with my stomach, but it went on for a couple days and just ended today. I was hoping these were just like symptoms of my body detoxing as to something being wrong with me.

3.5wks &amp; I'm starting to get overly grumpy every day

2:30 rolls around and I've been turning into what resembles a niccotine fiend. What I'm experiencing feels exactly like I just smoked a pack yesterday &amp; I'm dealing with the psychological addiction all over again. I KNOW I don't want a cigarette - so avoiding actually buying a pack is not an issue. But I'm so. fucking. grumpy. I'm short with the people I work with. I get to the point where I think everything they say is stupid (it's not) and I can't clearly communicate or make eye contact. Like mega, mega grumpy. I've never had anger issues in the past, so this is uncharted territory for me.

I can calm myself down by smoking a bowl of weed and having a beer -- but obviously I can't do that at work, haha.

Has anyone else experienced this grumpiness at this stage?

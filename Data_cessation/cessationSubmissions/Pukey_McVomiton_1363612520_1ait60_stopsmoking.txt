Just realized that I made it a month. 

I was up to 3 packs before I switched to the e-cig. Then with that, I upped the game. I was puffing half to a full on carton of cigarettes worth of nicotine a day. Fucking craziness. 

Honestly, I thought quitting smoking was supposed to be easy. Like a few days of being bitchy and that was it. This month has been absolute hell and I should have gone to a doctor and got mood stabilizers or something. It's been one of the worst experiences I've ever been though. With the amount of nicotine I was using there's a chance that this is might last for a few more months. 

Not really sure what the point of writing this was. I finally feel clear headed and calm today and wanted to share.

Tips to curb cravings while driving in a smoke-infused car?

Long time lurker, first time post, you know the drill. I’ve been mustering the willpower to quit for a few weeks now, and today is the day. My only concern is I almost exclusively smoke while driving, so my car smells like an ashtray. Almost instantly I crave one when I get into my car or while on the road. Any other ex-car smokers have any tips to cut that shit out, or tips to make the car smell better so it’s not a super trigger when I get in? Thanks in advance, all of your success stories give me strength to kill this habit before it kills me.

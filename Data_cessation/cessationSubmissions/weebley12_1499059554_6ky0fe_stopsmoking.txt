Quit for surgery, feeling resentful.

So, I quit for surgery. I went from 1+ packs per day to 3-4 smokes per week and then nothing. I have quit plenty of times. All cold turkey and no issues stopping. But because it feels like the choice was made for me, it has been especially tough. It's been 4 weeks. 2 weeks until surgery. I have found it particularly difficult to watch tv or movies where people smoke. It makes me angry, jealous, and resentful. Has anyone else experienced this?

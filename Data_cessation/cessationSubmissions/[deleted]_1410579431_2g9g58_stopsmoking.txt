My secret life as a smoker

(Warning: Venting)  
Believe it or not, I've been able to hide that I smoked from my wife for the last 4 years. I only smoked when I was at work or when she was at work. I was able to pull this off wearing a specific shirt/jacket that was only for smoking and before I would come home, I would stop by my parents and wash up.  
  
Hiding this from her has really put a damper on my relationship because I would keep a distance from guilt and from fear of her finding out. It has also hindered my creativity and my social interactions with people (like I'd rather stay home and smoke while I have the chance instead of going out with friends).
  
  
I've consistently smoked 4-6 cigarettes a day, but today is the day that I stop with the help of my own will and this subreddit, I hope to never smoke again.

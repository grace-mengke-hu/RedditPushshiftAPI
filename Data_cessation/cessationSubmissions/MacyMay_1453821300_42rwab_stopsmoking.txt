365!! Woo Hoo!!!

I remember when I first quit and got my badge thinking about how it would feel to make it to 365. I knew I would do it, I was and still am determined to be a non smoker for the rest of my life, and now I have made it. I am a very happy lady right now!

This sub has helped me a lot. Especially in the beginning.  You guys were a big part of my arsenal of positive reinforcements to quit and stay quit. It is a great feeling to hit this milestone. It has been a great year! Thank you to everyone on here. This is a wonderful supportive community which has been an integral part to my success.

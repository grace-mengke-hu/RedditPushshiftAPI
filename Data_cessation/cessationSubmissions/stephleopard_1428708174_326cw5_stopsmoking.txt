An awesome app bring me here!

So, I decided to go cold turkey beginning on April 1st, I was feeling horrible and one friend of my work recommended me an app to quit smoking with missions for each day. One of my missions was to spend time in the company of quitters and if it was hard to do it on person you can do it online and they add the link to this website. I have to say it is wonderful to see a lot of people helping each other with this struggle! I only have been 9 days without smoking and I feel terrible each day with cravings almost every 2 hours but I haven't smoke a single cigarette.

Can't believe I ever smoked

Every time I pass by people smoking, I feel disgusted, absolutely disgusted. The smell is absolute garbage, absolute poison. I feel sick smelling it that I have to cover up. Now I know the pain I caused others with my smoking. I feel disgusted that I smoked for so long. How could my mind play such tricks on me? 
I'm certain that I will never smoke another tobacco product again, nor will I ever take anything that has any nicotine in it. 
Once you rewire your brain you see smoking for what it really is, and not for what the nicotine monster inside you makes you believe it is. 
I just feel really disgusted with myself. I don't want to even be around smokers. I feel like tobacco is worse than heroine or other harder drugs at this point. At least people who use such drugs keep it to themselves, and don't go around smoking whenever they feel like it, and are not out in public doing it (most of the time). I wish tobacco was in the fringe like those harder drugs. It should be. It is at the top of the list of one of the dumbest things you can do or engage in. Just wanted to get that out of my chest. Tobacco and Nicotine are absolutely disgusting. And I will never go back. I am sure of it.

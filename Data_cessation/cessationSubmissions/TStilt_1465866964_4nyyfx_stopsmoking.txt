Ill be two years clean off heroin next month. But I want to Stop smoking

Just as the title says, quitting drugs and alcohol really wasnt that hard, they drove me to quit by ruining me. But i need to quit smoking and i want too... but i cant bring myself to do it.
Does anyone have any suggestions or ideas.

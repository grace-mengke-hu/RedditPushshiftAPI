Haven't smoked in six years. Here's my advice.

I had my last cigarette in April 2010 and haven't had a craving at all in over five years. Here's some food for thought from my perspective:

1: Don't be discouraged if you fall off the wagon. If you go a week without smoking but then give in and have one, you haven't fallen back to square one. On the contrary: you've gained a week of non-smoking. Go as long as you can without it, and if you have a moment of weakness just start again. It'll be easier the second time and you'll be able to go for longer.

2: Consider jumping into situations that normally make you want to smoke. If you can get through it, you'll help break the association between that activity and nicotine. A lot of smoking cessation is conditioning; you have to retrain your brain to no longer crave tobacco.

3: Everyone is different, so there's no telling how long and how much the cravings will persist, but it does get better! I was tearing my hair out the first two weeks, but after that the worst was over and I've never gone back. Now  the desire to smoke never even crosses my mind. Keep the hope alive!

Good luck! You can do it. I'm pulling for you!

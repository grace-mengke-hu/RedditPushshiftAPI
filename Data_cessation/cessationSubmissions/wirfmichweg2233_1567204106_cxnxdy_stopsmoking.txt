I smoked at a festival(on quit day 14) and it was disgusting

I kind of knew that it would be hard to withstand the urge while being drunk and in that social setting. But when I smoked my second cigarette I noticed how it didnt really feel good and the guilt made me extinguish it. I also had to bum both and the second one was a thin menthol cigarette that was absolutely disgusting. 
Now, about a week later and after going through the withdrawal again I can feel my lungs starting to heal and it hurts. I am way more concious of my body/pain and feel the need to exercise. 

The problem is that my right eye is infammated rn  and my doctor suspects that it might be caused by Rheumatism. Felt like I needed to get all that off my chest, cause I feel super anxious and tired since I quit.

If not for you...

I have had so much stress on my plate. I live alone, I'm 24, my boyfriend of 10 years left after he stopped working a few months ago (he just stopped going to work and stayed up all night playing video games and slept all day, so we were solely living on my income), I have Crohn's Disease and have been admitted to the hospital several times this past year for about 5-7 days each time, my school says I am on academic suspension (even though I have a 4.0) due to an error with my financial aid so I am unable to take classes this semester (I've tried talking to them, it's unlikely it'll be fixed in time), and I can't pay rent this month and have three days to come up with rent (plus a grand in late fees and legal fees) in three days or I'll be evicted. The owner is unwilling to make arrangements.


Even with all of that, here I stand at 20 days without a cigarette. I am staying active, toning my body, losing weight, focusing on my art, my goals, and not smoking. If not for the surge of motivation I find in this subreddit I don't know how I would have been able to do this, let alone maintain a cool and level head. 

To anyone who thinks a 'bad day' warrants a quick smoke, you're better than that. You're strong. You're amazing. You don't need that smoke, you need to focus on what you can do to make yourself the best you possible.

God dammit, thank you.


//whoever golded me, it may seem like a small thing but you made me all teary. Thank you so much. Now I need to figure out what gold does!

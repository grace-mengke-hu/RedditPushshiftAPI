How do I help a loved one stop smoking?

My girlfriend wants to quit but is having trouble doing so.  It's been around a month since I last spoke to her about it and just found out she still smokes around a pack a day.  She says she hates it and wants to stop but is afraid of doing so. I know asking her about it and being pushy will only frustrate her... I wish there was something I can do. I smoke socially with her, this is the only time I ever smoke.  I'm going to stop doing that as I feel I'm supporting it. She's been smoking for about 8 years now.  I really love her and hate her feeling ashamed of it and I hate that I feel ashamed of it. I want her to try.  How can I be supportive, what are the best ways to help?  Any advice is appreciated.

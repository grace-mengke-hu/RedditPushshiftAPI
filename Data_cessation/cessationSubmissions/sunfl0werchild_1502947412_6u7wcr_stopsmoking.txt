Difficult emotions...

Today was really hard. What are some suggestions you guys have for dealing with difficult emotions? I'm not just talking about the occasional getting angry or irritated. I'm talking about when s**t really hits the fan. Not trying to be a total buzz kill, but like someone close to you passes away, you're financially screwed, a close friend leaves, etc. I'm doing my best to not have any reservations this time, but I definitely need some coping mechanisms for when things get tougher than normal and chewing a piece of gum or drinking water just won't cut it. Thanks in advance for your help and for being here.

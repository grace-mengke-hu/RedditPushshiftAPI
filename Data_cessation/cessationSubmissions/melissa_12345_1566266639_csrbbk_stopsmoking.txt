Things that have helped me stay smoke-free!

Quit day 19 mission: things that have helped keep me smoke free!

1.) Saying the mantra “Not another puff, no matter what” oddly has helped me the most. I think because it diverts my craving thought to why I’m quitting.

2.) Swimming- I’ve been swimming everyday and this has helped so much with any anxiety, thus cravings, and it’s just relaxing.

3.) This app has been so helpful. It gave my brain something to do besides wanting to smoke and cigarette and reconfirms why I want to quit.

4.) I didn’t know about this group on reddit. It has helped immensely reading what other people are doing and feeling. I may not post very often but, I read a ton.

Quitting again after relapsing

I'm Male, 19 and live in England.

I quit smoking at the end of 2012 after reading 'Allen Carr's easy way to stop smoking' and I found it very easy, after quitting I enjoyed smoke free life immensely but I did miss it, so from time to time I'd have a cig at a party or whatnot but I mainly stayed away from it. At the beginning of this year I relapsed badly, buying some cigarettes and I haven't stopped since and I really want to quit again. 

See the thing is, I hate smoking when at home and in every day life, but then when I'm with friends I find it pretty enjoyable.

I want to quit for good and I don't really know where to start this time. 

Thanks everyone, I'm new to this subreddit so sorry if there's anything wrong with this post.

Started two months ago, need to quit before Wednesday

With the college stress in addition to a lot of relationship stress, I started smoking two months ago. And I enjoyed it while it lasted, but on Wednesday I'm going back to my family and I need to quit practically cold turkey. I tossed out my pack last night, and lasted 18 hours. Then I bought another pack and I feel like shit for it. 

I know two months of smoking is not much, but I already regret the moment I reached out for that first cigarette. 

What are some tips you guys can give me?

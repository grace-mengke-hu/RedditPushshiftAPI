Everything hurts.

Well I am at 126 hours and my entire body still aches, weird pins and needles in my legs and a constant headache and I don't even want to think about my chest right now, it is just slow deep ache.

Is this normal? because honestly guys I am scared. 

EDIT: Update! I am feeling a little bit better today, I have been sleeping a lot more and not stressing out as much as I was before, still having headaches but I called my doctor and he said I should see a decrease in headaches in the coming days, thanks for the advice guys!

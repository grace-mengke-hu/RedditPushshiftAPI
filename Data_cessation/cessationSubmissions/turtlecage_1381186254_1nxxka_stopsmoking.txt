I had my first smoking dream

Or should I say nightmare. 

In the dream I was just hanging out and talking to a friend when all of a sudden, I noticed I was smoking a cigarette. I was PISSED! I threw the cigarette on the ground and yelled, "I'm so stupid!" 

I even changed my badge back to zero in my dream. When I woke up and it wasn't real, I was so relieved! 

Thank you so much for the support and motivating posts. Hooray for 43 days :D

Finally, I feel free!

I am currently on day four of quitting cold turkey. This is my second attempt in less than a few weeks, the first attempt failed miserably. I made some changes from the first go around and it really helped me succeed in quitting. 

First, I added a prayer request in my Sunday School class since it would hold me accountable. I've tried and failed so many times, being held accountable by family just wasn't enough. 

The first two days were absolutely miserable. I cried so many times. I didn't sleep well at all. But I resolved myself to not quit. Wednesday I even started an argument with my husband, usually this is when I give up and go running to the closest gas station for cigarettes. But I held firm. Later, my husband asked what he could do to support me, I asked him to keep forgiving me every time I act irrationally. 

My brain still feels a bit foggy. Concentrating takes a lot more effort than before but it's getting better. 

There were some improvements I expected to notice but others have pleasantly surprised me. My breathing, taste and smell are awesome! It feels like I have super senses. But I truly did not expect the absolute elation and energy that has bombarded me. I'm a stay at home mom so cleaning has been my outlet. I have cleaned and organized things that I have been procrastinating for forever. My anxiety and depression, gone. I do still get mental cues to smoke. Like I just ate and would typically smoke, instead of focusing on the feeling of wanting, I clean. I play with my kids. My God this is marvelous! I am so over run with joy and thankfulness. Thank God for the strength, this sub and the smoke free app to finally rid myself of this death.

Quitting again!

I used to smoke a packet a day and then I quit for six months. Went for a trip with close buddies two months back. I thought "I know how to quit, I can manage smoking in this trip." However, that didn't happen. I had failed "Not one more puff, no matter what!". I have started smoking a packet a day again. I want to quit starting now. 

Some of my triggers, reasons and steps I am taking:
1. Hunger: I smoke whenever I feel hungry. I live on my own and cook myself. I am lazy at times and substitute food with smoke. I have decided to get lots of fruits and berries that I can munch when I am hungry.

2. Stress: We all have stress. I am trying to find a better way to cope with it. I am moving towards listening to music, talking to friends, and exercise. I also love studying, especially when I write as I read.

3. Water: Drinking slightly cold water helps reducing the craving. I keep them in the fridge, fill a glass full and drink slowly. Keeping hydrated helps a lot.

4. Exercise: I have decided to continue with trainer and exercise more often. This helps in improving the heart and lungs, and also to deal with stress. Moreover, I know I might be eating a lot more at this stage.

5. Blood flow: Nicotine reduces the flow of blood by constricting the blood vessels. Moreover, the lungs are not able to pump in as much oxygen as they could. The combined effect is catastrophic on health. Fun fact question: what body part needs a sudden flow of lot of blood to do its job well (for males)? 

6. Mints: they help a lot to keep the mouth busy.

7. Nicotine gum and patch: I had used them last time successfully. I am trying cold turkey this time. However, I still have them from last time and I will use it if required.

Let's try to quit together! Not another puff, no matter what!

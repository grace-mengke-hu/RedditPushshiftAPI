44 Days

One month and 14 days in! Never thought I’d get this far without cracking but I’ve been able to pass up every chance I’ve had to relapse! 

The cravings, when they do happen, are quite strong, but I’m able to breathe through them.  

Had a pretty HUGE craving today.  I spent an impromptu 15 hours at work.  Was so so so very tempted to bum a smoke from one of my coworkers as a treat because there was nothing I enjoyed more as a smoker than coming home and having that well earned cigarette and a beer, but managed to talk myself out of it.  

I’m still having that beer though.

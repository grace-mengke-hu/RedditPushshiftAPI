Looking for beta testers for an app to help you quit smoking!

Hi /r/stopsmoking!
       
 

We are [accountaBull](http://accountabull.io), a team of recent Stanford grads rapidly developing a mobile app centered around kicking bad habits and forming good habits through social and monetary incentives. Recent research has shown that people are more likely to achieve their goals when these types of incentives are introduced. 

 

Our app allows users to create goals for themselves for some stake, and holds users accountable for completing their goals by automatically enforcing the agreed upon stakes. We allow for both monetary stakes -- for example, putting down $100 to commit to a week without cigarettes -- as well as social stakes such as sharing your (lack of) progress or an embarrassing post to Facebook. We envision building a community of users that support one another in achieving their goals and that hold one another accountable when they do not.

 

We want accountaBull to be centered around our users, so, we are looking for feedback regarding our concept and potential directions forward. We are also searching for users to download and test the beta version of our application, which will be going live in the coming days -- **if you join now, you could have a big impact on the upcoming versions of the app!**

 

Learn more at [our website](http://accountabull.io) or send us an email at: `noah (at) accountabull (dot) io`. Of course, feel free to PM us or comment with any interest or feedback. 

 

Thank you for your time,

The accountaBull Team

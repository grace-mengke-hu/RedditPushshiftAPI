14 days. Trying nicotine free again today.

I'm proud of not smoking for two weeks even though I still feel pretty yucky.  That probably isn't just bc of not smoking though, I have severe allergies and have been using nrt still, which I think is dragging out the withdrawal.  But it was pretty unbearable without nrt before bc of my anxiety and PTSD.  Hoping today is day 1 of zero nicotine forever.

Reading and posting here has really helped me stay the course, and distracted me when I needed it.  I have a ton of nervous energy but when I try to put it to good use, I have no stamina and end up taking a nap.  I'm really kind of fascinated by my body's addiction and withdrawal reactions.   

Now, I need Smoke Free app to give me my 2 week badge, lol.  I earned that badge already, and I want it!  Hope everyone is hanging in!

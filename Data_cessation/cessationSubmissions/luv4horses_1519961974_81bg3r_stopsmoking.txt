After 2 months of not smoking, I relapsed

I'm so upset at myself. I worked so hard and fought so hard to stay quit but failed. I smoked last weekend with a friend and bought a pack on Tues. I was a smoker for 30 years and I was still fighting the urge everyday to not smoke. I don't know how to quit. I thought I had it this time. I used the patches at first, then the nic gum. I got sick of chewing the gum on Tuesday and said screw up, I'm having a cigarette and it was awesome. It felt great but now after the third day of smoking, I have a headache and don't feel as good as I was. This really sucks. I don't know what else to do. I feel like I have to have help to quit. I have failed many times with cold turkey. I had also read Allen Carr book. What else is there. Why can't I quit?  This is so depressing. Am I just meant to be a smoker?  Ugh!!!

another attempt...

this has ought to be about my four-thousandth attempt at quitting smoking, but one of the few that i feel totally committed to.  using the nicotine patch since yesterday afternoon and so far feeling pretty good about it.  trying to convince myself that my willpower is stronger than my craving for nicotine.  i don't want to wallow any longer for the power that a substance has over my will.  i want to take back control.

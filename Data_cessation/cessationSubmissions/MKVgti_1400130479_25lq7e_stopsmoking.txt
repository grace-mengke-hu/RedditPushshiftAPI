I am known because i buy a different pack every time, today i figured out why.

I absolutely must buy a different brand of cigarettes every time i buy a new pack, i just thought of it as something i did just because, but what it really is, is a subconscious choice, i smoke every day, about 10 cigs on a bad day, but it can go up to 12, i smoke them throughout the whole day, since i awake, until i go to bed, every time i repeat a pack, is as if im repeating the whole day, every time i light that same cigarette, it feels as if i had already lived through that recently, and it all feels so repetitive, something that affects you on a unconscious level like that must be so terrible. I just wanted to write this somewhere.

Relatively light smoker- Can I continue smoking at the rate that I do without significant health risks?

Usually I will smoke 10-15 cigarettes over the weekend (Friday evening to Sunday evening)- mainly because I will be out with friends and such...  Monday thru Friday I may smoke 1 per night, some times I am busy and won't have one. I guess it averages out to about 1 pack per week. I've been smoking at this rate for about a year now. I don't have any urges to smoke during the day while I'm at work, some times I do when I get home from work, but it will only be 1 smoke a night at most. What do you guys think my health risks are?

After months of lurking on various accounts, I’m on day 1

Love reading posts in here and I’m really not excited about the next few days but I’m almost 24 hours without a cigarette. I’m using the lowest dose patch right now to get through the week then nothing. Since I just quit drinking, too, I’m out of (physically) bad habits!

I finally have the motivation to quit

Like most people, I decided that it would be my new years resolution to quit smoking. I haven't succeeded for the last few days, and was going to actually continue until last night. I went out drinking and when we ran out of cigarettes, we started smoking chewing tobacco. I am extremely grossed out by myself. I never realized how much nicotine controlled my life. 

So from this day forth, I will be coming on this subreddit each and every day to ensure that I can really quit.

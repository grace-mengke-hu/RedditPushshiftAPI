Stopped smoking but need help!

So it's been 24 days since I last smoked. Currently I've stopped having cravings and it really feels great.

However, I guess I reward myself too much, so I've gained weight. So, is this normal to gain weight?

The other thing is, after quitting, I am now worried about the teeth stains. Could you guys recommend something to get rid of those stains!

Thanks

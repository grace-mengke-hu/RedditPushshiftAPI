a HATE a DAY #3

3 days ago, I made a promise to post 1 thing I hate about smoking everyday. 
...day 3

My smokes! has anyone seen my smokes?! ok, where's my lighter?! who the @#!!& took my lighter?! where is it?!

I hate "NEEDING" my smokes before I go anywhere. sometimes it'll take me an extra 5 minutes to leave the house because the damn things will be hiding from me! after tearing the roof off trying to find the them things, I would often find myself frustrated to the point where others would feel bad and just start helping me look for them....oh there they are :) ...on the patio hidden by the ashtray :( 

I don't have to worry about that now, a lil less to stress about. I like it!

3rd times a charm

I’m only 25, but I’ve smoked cigarettes on and off since I was 12 years old. It didn’t become a real habit until I was 18 however because it was easier to get ahold of it. I quit when I found out I was pregnant at 22, (cold turkey and because I was pregnant had a good motivation and was already sick so it was pretty easy). Then when I was 23 I ended up back smoking because I went out for the first time since having my baby, I drank, which once I drink, it’s almost always a game over I will smoke. Then last year I got the flu, so I stopped smoking to make me feel better and after a week I just figured why not try it again. It only lasted a month. A lot of my friends and my boyfriend are smokers, when I’m around them, even though I don’t like the smell, I miss it. I’m only three days in my third real attempt at quitting, I’ve been congested and sick, so it makes it easier to quit. This time is really different though. I still have a half a pack stored in its place, and it’s so easy for my brain to be like “ just one won’t hurt”, but I enjoy looking at the pack every day and see that I haven’t smoked any. My cravings, however, are worse on day three then they were on day one. I really wanna quit, I wanna be healthy, I wanna not smell like that, especially since my son is now 2 and will realize what I’m doing. I don’t want him to think it’s ok for him to smoke when he is older because I will whoop that ass lol. I wanna watch him grow old and get married and see my grandkids, and I can’t do that if I’m not taking care of myself. But with all this motivation, why is it still so hard!!

I feel like there are 1000s bees in my head

and they are all buzzing and pissed off because they all want a cigarette. This is day 1, yesterday I cut down to 2 smokes, now I'm trying to go to 0. This is what's keeping me going: "Remember that there are only two good reasons to take a puff once you quit. You decide you want to go back to your old level of consumption until smoking cripples and then kills you, or, you decide you really enjoy withdrawal and you want to make it last forever.  As long as neither of these options appeal to you - NEVER TAKE ANOTHER PUFF!"

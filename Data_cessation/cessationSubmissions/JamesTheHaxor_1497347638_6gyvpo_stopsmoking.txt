When you're stressed, or agitated, during quitting what things get on your nerves the most?

What winds you up the most when you're in an agitated, or stressed, mood during quitting?

For me it's the TV, or loud background noise. It boils my blood to the point where I have to go for a walk. Another one is people wasting my time with small talk and beating around the bush. I feel like saying "I AM TRYING TO WORK HERE! LEAVE ME ALONE! I DO NOT CARE FOR YOUR FACEBOOK ARGUMENTS!".

Now, the question is did smoking make me more tolerant to the things I hate, or is this just a phase that will pass? Prior to quitting I was fine. I'm hoping the phase will pass. I don't want to be hot headed monster all my life :( I also find I can be argumentative and politically correct a lot more than before.

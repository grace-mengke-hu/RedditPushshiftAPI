First night trying to quit (marijuana)

So I'm not sure if I belong, if not, I'll quietly see myself out. I just wanted to share with someone. I figured Reddit would be the best place since everyone is so accepting. I'm trying to quit smoking. I've been smoking every day for 4 years now. I haven't noticed any decrease in lung function, but I still feel like it's an unhealthy habit. Anyways, tonight is my first night, and I am really nervous! I've been smoking before bed for at least a year and a half. I'm afraid I won't be able to sleep tonight. Anyways, wish me luck!

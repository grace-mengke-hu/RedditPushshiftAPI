I want to get my parents to stop smoking.

My dad quit for about 5 years after having smoked all his life, my mom has never quit (except during pregnancy, probably). My dad started again like 2 weeks ago and I really want to get the to stop. Dad is 50 and mom is 49. Any tips?



Also, I just got done having cancer (~3 months remission) and I found out that second hand smoke is a potential cause of the cancer I had. Should I bring this up at all? Or only as a last resort? They smoked around me a lot when I was a child and only stopped when we found out I had cancer. Now that I'm not getting chemo anymore, they're smoking in the house again. I don't want to lay a huge guilt trip on them, but after smoking for 30-40 years, they're well overdue for some health problems.


Thanks ahead for any help you might give me.

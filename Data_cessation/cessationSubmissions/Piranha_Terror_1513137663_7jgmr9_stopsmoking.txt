Cleaned out my ashtray today

14 days 10 hours 57 minutes since my last cancer stick. I admittedly don't *really* feel like I'm quitting; I traded the packs in for a vape. But damn, the other day I ran out of battery and I was *not* about to blow $10 (California is so expensive) on a pack when I could just wait it out. Ashtrays are fucking gross.  I'm 21 years old and I'm getting ahead of the game. I'm done smoking, I'm going to ween myself off nicotine, and I've quit drinking. I will not be my family's heir. I will inherit recovery, not futile addiction.

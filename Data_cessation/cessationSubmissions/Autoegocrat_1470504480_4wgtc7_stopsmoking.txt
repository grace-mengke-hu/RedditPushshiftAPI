Day 4: 24 yr smoker, cold turkey

I keep cigarettes laying around to test myself. I have two packs left that i havent given away yet. One is in my car and the other in my living room. Not once have i reached for them. Feeling like throwing away my couch and getting new carpet because i smoked in the house for 4 years. 

No problems to report! Easy peasy :)

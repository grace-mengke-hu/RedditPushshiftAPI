17 days, 18 hours & 9 minutes since I quit smoking.

I posted not too long ago regarding my experience quitting with Zyban. Nothing really new to say about the prescription, though my sleep patterns still aren't quite what they were.  

Here's some exciting little things from not smoking that I've noticed! 

• I'm applying for new places to live/rent and don't have to lie about being a smoker. 
• I catch myself worrying if I smell like cigarettes when standing close to coworkers, clients, etc... and realize it's not necessary. 
• I *feel* cleaner. 
• I can't remember the last time I coughed. 
• One of my smoking buddies at work asked me today if I'm still going strong & I didn't know what she was referring to. 
• Then when I realized she was asking about smoking, I had to check my app to tell her how long it's been. 

I've gotta good feeling about this.

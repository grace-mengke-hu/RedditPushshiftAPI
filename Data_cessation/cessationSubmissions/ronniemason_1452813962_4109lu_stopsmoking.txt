Day 6 and Feeling Good!

This is my first post after many years lurking on reddit. But I found this subreddit through the "Smoke Free" app for iOS. My last cigarette was on Friday night, and here we are at almost one week. This is my fifth time to try quitting, and this is it for me. One thing that has helped me the most is not trying to "forget" that I was a smoker. That might not work for everyone, but it has certainly helped me. I know what lies ahead for me tomorrow, that statistically the cravings double on the seventh day before doing back down and then gradually tapering off ... and that's why I'm here. I don't have much to offer yet, but I wanted to welcome myself to the community, and anticipate the amount of help that awaits me tomorrow, and the continuing days ahead.

I'm 30 years old and have smoked a pack and a half of cigarettes per day for the last 10 years. My mother passed away less than two months ago, on November 28th, due to smoking related issues. That was it for me, I knew I needed to quit. I'm doing so with the help of Chantix.

So, that's all to this post. Just here to introduce myself, and to tell anyone who might be currently craving or is struggling to quit, stay strong.

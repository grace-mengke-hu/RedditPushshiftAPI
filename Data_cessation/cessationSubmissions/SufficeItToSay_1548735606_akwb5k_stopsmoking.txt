I feel like I've done some pretty awesome things in the past few months, and it's time to finally do this.

I went from being mostly vegetarian to vegan. I've lost 30 lbs. I taught myself to cook and meal prep healthy food and went from eating fast food several times a week to never. I went from never drinking water to drinking some every day. I'm proud of myself for what I've accomplish so far, but there's always this lingering elephant in the room of my smoking habit. 

And I'm just... I'm tired of being my cigarette addiction's b\*tch. I know that's not a classy way to put it, but that really is what it feels like. Especially after today. 

A few weeks ago I told myself I'd smoke what I have left, and then buy no more. I thought today was the day, I had run out. I gave my husband (who is also a smoker and *not* quitting) all my lighters and tried not to think about it too much. I only lasted a short time until I had finished my first meal of the day and that urge to smoke immediately tapped on my shoulder. I thought maybe I still have one pack left in my car. *And I did.* I had never felt such a sickening feeling of relief mixed with regret and dread all at the same time. I smoked and hated myself. I beat myself up for submitting. "I can change all these other things in my life, why can't I do this? This is *insane*."

I'm trying to stay positive. Today didn't go as planned, but I will try again tomorrow.  I have to face facts that it's not going to be as easy as I hoped it would be, and I'm just going to have to dig in and learn a whole brand new set of coping skills and strategies to get through this one day at a time.

Wish me luck!

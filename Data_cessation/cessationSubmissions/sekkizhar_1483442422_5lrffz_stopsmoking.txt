69 days and counting...

Used to smoke 1-3 sticks every day for 10 years. After many attempts, I have successfully reached 69 days. Is it normal to have a phlegm buildup in the throat and sinus during this period? 

This feeling of not being addicted to something is amazing. I am more energetic and the return of the sense of smell and taste is working wonders. To any new quitters here, I have certainly gotten better in the 69 days so far.

I stopped buying cigarettes, but I still bum them every day

I stopped buying cigarettes over a month ago, but there are so many people around me who smoke.  They all know that I stopped buying cigarettes, so they always give some to me for free.  This happens 1-4 times every day.  I'm sick of it.  I told myself that I was going to quit.  I justified this to myself because I don't spend money on cigarettes anymore.  That's not quitting.  That's not what I wanted.  I told myself that I was going to quit.  I'm going to quit.  I bought some nicotine gum.  I'm done smoking.

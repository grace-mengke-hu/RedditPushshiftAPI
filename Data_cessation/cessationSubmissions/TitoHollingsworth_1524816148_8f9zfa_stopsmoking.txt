Need advice to quit

I want to quit. It's expensive and makes me smell bad. I quit cold turkey when I was pregnant but had a serious reason  why. After I weaned her from breast to bottle and formula. I started smoking again. I need a plan to cut back and then cut back again etc to wean off gradually.

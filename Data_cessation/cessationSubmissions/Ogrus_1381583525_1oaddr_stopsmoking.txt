There and back again

No, I'm not a hobbit. I'm not new to quitting at all - I quit smoking last year for **six** months straight and couldn't believe how many positive effects there are to quitting. Sadly, I chose to use a difficult period in my life to fall back on my old crutch this last January. A couple of months back into the habit and I'm smoking 10-20 cigarettes a day. I hate that I gave up. I'm short of breath when I want to run, everything smells, I have to go outside while temperatures are dropping fast and generally don't feel in control about myself anymore at all.

So consider this a third and final farewell, I won't ever look back. I have a couple of sticks left for the weekend and as of Monday, I'll be a non-smoker. Good riddance. I'll be sure to come back here when the urges are strongest. Thanks for being here, quitters!

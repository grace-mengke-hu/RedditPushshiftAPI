Teenager stopping, need advice

Hello everyone. 
I have smoked at parties since I was about 14 years. Last year I started my higher education. I was 16. Here I began to think it was fun to smoke settled, we smoke during breaks. I've always felt bad from nicotine very quickly and could not smoke as much as the others. One year after smoking I 1-5 cigarettes a day and about 20 when I'm at a party. It's rare I feel like i need a cigarette, maybe once in a while in the morning. Otherwise i smoke most cigarettes when I'm with the others from the school. I have always been a sporty person. I now have stuck to an e-cigarette the last few days. I feel like I can easily stop. The only thing that keeps me smoking, is that I love to sit and be emotional and listen to music. I also love the smoke and to play with it. I also like trying new brands and researching about the brands. I feel you are successful with a cigarette, that is, it is fashion. I am reading Allen Carr's book. I'm 17 now. need your advice now. It's like saying my third day without and have no desire for a cigarette.

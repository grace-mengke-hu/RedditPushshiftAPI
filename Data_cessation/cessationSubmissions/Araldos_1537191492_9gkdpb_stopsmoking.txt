Problem: Spending the evening in pub without a desire to smoke.

Hi Everyone,

I love going to pub and have some beers with my friends ( and I don't want to stop this ) and for the longest time it was connected to smoking. Sitting outside with beers and smoke with friends = dream after everyday struggle. 

I was never a heavy smoker, just casual to average. I stopped smoking and I can manage quite easily everyday situations. The only problem is the pubs, bars with friends.... I know that I will get a very strong temptation, desire to smoke in these situations.

So I would like to ask some general tips or experience on this.

AND ask the non-smokers who had similar problem, if the temptation ever gone away. (because I'd love to hear it, but I cant imagine it... enjoy beer without a single thought of lighting a cig).

 Thanks.

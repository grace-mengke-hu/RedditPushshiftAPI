If I got through this past week, I can get through anything.

I'm truly amazed at myself. I've had a really rough week; bad news followed by issues at work, financial worries, stress over health concerns and to top it all off, my dog passed away.

Guess what, though? I didn't smoke.

I. Did. Not. Smoke.

I even went out for a couple of drinks with friends last night. They all smoke and so I had the option of stay inside alone, or go out to the sheltered smoking area with them. I went with them, I sat for an hour as they and everyone else chain-smoked, and I didn't smoke. I was offered frequently (and mocked by some random stranger) but I didn't do it. 

Day 15 was where I messed it all up last time. I was terrified of ruining it all yesterday. But here I am, on day 16 with even more resolve than before.

I think I can officially say I'm a non-smoker :')

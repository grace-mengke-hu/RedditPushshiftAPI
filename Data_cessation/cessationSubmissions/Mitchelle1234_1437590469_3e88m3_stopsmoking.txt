Day 30!!

Just wanted to say have been reading the posts on here they have helped me out a lot!
Thought I'd be brave and do a post of my own and share one of my smoke free milestones. I've made it 30days!! feeling accomplished and beginning to believe I am once again a non smoker! :D practically one month down. Hope it gets easier from here onwards.

Voice became higher pitched after quitting, and its annoying me

Hi guys, honestly I don't know if this is the right place to post this, but it seems like it atm.

I've quit smoking over a year now, without relapse, and the one thing I hate about it is that my voice became a bit higher than it was, and it's honestly annoying the sh.t outta me.

Anything I can do to regain/keep that low pitch I liked?

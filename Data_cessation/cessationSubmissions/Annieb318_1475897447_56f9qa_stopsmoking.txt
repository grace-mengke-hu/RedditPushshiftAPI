Depression and quitting

I quit smoking 7 weeks ago and I am using the patches. I have suffered with clinical depression all of my adult life but finally got to a point over a year ago where I could control it without medication. The first week of using the patch and no cigs, my anxiety was sky high and I was certainly moody. But after that first week was over I felt great! Well since going to the 3rd and final step on the patches- the 7mg, a week ago, I feel different. Moody as hell, depressed, can't concentrate, angry outbursts, and sometimes just empty. I've also been craving cigarettes a lot more, again. I went 5 weeks barely even thinking about them! And now this.

My question is, will this pass? Today hasn't been quite as bad as the rest of the week. But if this does pass, will I feel the same in another week when I finally stop the patch? Will I feel WORSE? If I end up feeling worse for more than a week I don't know that I won't start smoking again. Has anyone ever had experience with clinical depression and trying to quit. I really need some help.

If there's one thing worse than the poison of a cigarette,  that is the poison of your own mind/brain turning against you in the form of mental illness. I have also dealt with and still sometimes do deal with chronic anxiety, panic attacks, and derealization/depersonalization. All of which team together. The depression was/is the big one for me though.

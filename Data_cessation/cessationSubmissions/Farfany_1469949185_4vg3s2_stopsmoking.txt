Wow, I passed the 14 day mark without noticing! The change in desire is amazing.

I really don't feel like smoking right now. I mean I do, it would be kind of nice, but I know where it would lead and that knowledge trumps my desire to inhale nasty smoke. 

I know that if I bought a pack I would regret it on the way there, in the gas station, on the way home and for the entirety of the duration of my cigarette. I don't like feeling clogged up, or smelling like cigarettes, or wasting money on a pointless addiction that brings me very little pleasure other than, truthfully, some sort of fucked up self-harming comfort. 

I don't need cigarettes and right now, I know it. Stay strong my brothers and sisters.

Advice request

Hey all, 

I'm usign patches this time as I can't take a month off work to get over withdrawals. Plan to stop using patches when I can afford to take a month off work maybe next year. 

Issue:  when I first started  using them approx  2 months ago, they were very effective, indeed I felt more productive and happy, they were nootropic. 

However, now they seem less effective - is this my brain adjusting to the nicotine level (there's a word for this) and down-regulating?  

If so can I just put on an extra nicotine patch? 

I recall allan car mentioning that your brain basically maxes out at about a pack a day's worth of nicotine, hence more people smoke a pack a day. What would this be in terms of nicotine patches? I'm using 21 mg nicabate invispatchs.

Any experience on long term NRT use would be appreciated. I know you're meant to 'step down' and eventually stop using nicotine patches, but I'm addicted to nicotine and really cant afford the time off work at the moment to quite it properly, nor can I afford the lack of productivity quitting cold turkey would cause (tried it, almost felt asleep most days, the lethargy killed me).

Relapse

Hi all. I love this sub, and reading everyone’s stories helped me (28yo from Utah) quit smoking after two years at a pack a day. 

I was off nicotine for three months after reading Allen Carr’s book and taking Chantix. But I kept having urges to smoke, particularly in the last three weeks in the buildup to a big business trip. 

The day before I left for the trip, my girlfriend (who has been an amazing support in helping me quit/stay off smokes) had a panic attack that was super emotionally taxing, and I was so stressed before going to the airport that I broke down and bought a pack of smokes and smoked two. 

I felt bad, but assumed I could just ditch it after getting to Argentina. I was wrong, and kept smoking while I was there. I got back home and was too embarrassed to tell my GF, but have continued to smoke one here and there in secret. I’m now starting to feel the same cravings I felt before quitting, and the embarrassment and shame that has always accompanied smoking for me have returned. 

I don’t want to be a smoker again. I hate coughing, I hate getting tired while playing soccer, I hate the smell, I hate being unable to taste things, and I hate having to leave my desk every few hours to get my brain back on track, but quitting full-stop again feels daunting. 

For those of you who have quit, fallen back into the trap, and quit again, what helped you get back on track? I’m planning to re-read the book this weekend and spend as much time with my GF as possible (I don’t smoke when I’m with her), but any other tips you have would be most welcome. You’re all inspirations to me.

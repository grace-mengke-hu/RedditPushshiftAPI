Just wanted to share today. 8days in this thing 🚭

Just needed to hop on here and say how bad my cravings are right now. I know they will pass. They always do. But still hard non the-less.  I’ve been trying to keep a watch on what I am doing at the time of my craving and then alter that behavior. So, here it is Saturday. Time for family and relaxing time. My mother in law is in town and that always brings me stress.  Usually when she is around and the air becomes too think in the house, I would pop outside for 15 mins or so. Smoke a few cigarettes. Reboot. And then had back in. I’m sure I would do this quite often throughout the weekend. So today, same issues. Just now I’m dealing with them as a non smoker. I decided to go outside anyways. Not to smoke. But to soak up some sun. Deep breath!!! Have some me time for about 15 mins.  Then back inside. Did this, felt great about it. And then proceeded to argue with my husband about the stove setting to cook something 🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️ At least I didn’t smoke! Now, how to channel these urges into something other than pissing people off. Stay strong my fellow non-smokers!!!

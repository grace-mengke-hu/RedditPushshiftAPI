Mouth pain?

It's been two months and as of two days ago, I've noticed that my mouth hurts. The roof of my mouth, my gums are tender, I have to chew a bit softer. My tongue feels fine. I don't see anything in my mouth to be concerned about and I haven't eaten anything out of the norm. I've read that smoking kills oral bacteria...is this just my mouth coming back to life?

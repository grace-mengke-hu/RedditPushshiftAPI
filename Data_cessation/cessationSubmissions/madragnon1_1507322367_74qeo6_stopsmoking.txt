22 days in!

22 days in now and feeling like this might FINALLY be the time I quit for good. I spent the past year telling myself I'd quit as soon as I finished this pack/made that deadline. Was going to quit for my birthday/my kids' birthdays/my anniversary/etc. Then I got super sick and was like enough already, I don't want to live my life like this anymore. Being sick made the quit relatively easy since I could barely eat, never mind smoke; had my first craving last night at 22 days, weirdly enough, but I was like, "Not today, Satan!" and made it through ;)
Smoke free app has been a big help; I didn't use nicotine replacement this time around but have in the past. I switched to a different gas station than the ones where I usually bought ciggies- also helpful. And I stopped drinking entirely, because in the past that's always been my downfall. Onward!

Let's Do The Damn Thing

About a year ago I fell off of the wagon after three years smoke free. I got out of graduate school and started drinking pretty heavily a couple of years ago and had myself convinced I could be one of those guys who could smoke when they drink without going back to a pack and a half a day. I was wrong. I'm three days deep now and I have no doubt that this is far from over, but I've already had small victories along the way. My badge is almost to 1800 and I'll get back up to that (I requested a reset for three days).

I just got dumped about a month ago and realized I needed to do some self improvement for myself, not for anyone else. I looked back at myself from like 2012 and 2013 and realized that guy was motivated as fuck. The guy I turned into wasn't. I'm giving up alcohol for the first month of this as well and I'm actually going to reassess if I want to go back to drinking after this first month. So...let's fucking do this. Fuck cigarettes.

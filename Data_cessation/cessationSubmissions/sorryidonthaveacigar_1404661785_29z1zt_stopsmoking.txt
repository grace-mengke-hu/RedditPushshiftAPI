Angry as hell

It has been 10 days. So far, so good, not easy but it has not been impossible. Yesterday night I got home, had dinner, watch tv. When I was about to go to bed everything started to go wrong. I dropped a glass of water on my bed, couldn't find my pills. Anyway, I stared to get very angry and frustrated. I stared to smack stuff around me. I yelled and cried. I think this is they way my body found to get that frustration out but I just wish I could come to peace soon since I really hate this anger inside me.

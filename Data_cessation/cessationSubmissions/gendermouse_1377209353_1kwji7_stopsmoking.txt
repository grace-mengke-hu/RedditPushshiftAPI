15 days. Friends impressed/inspired/supportive.

Friends and I had been smoking for long time and we tried so many times to quit that is a sad joke.

This time though, I have pushed through 2 weeks.  My friends are happy for me.  In previous attempts to quit, they used to laugh and pressure me to start up.

So this time I stayed locked up in the house for a number of days, and kept my movements out of the house restricted.  When I started seeing them again, I did not smoke saying that I just had a smoke.  After a few days, they realised that I wasn't smoking and asked me about this.  So I came clean.

Surprisingly, this time around, there was no laughing.  They were genuinely happy for me.  They are asking me how I have done this.  And they are actually looking inspired.

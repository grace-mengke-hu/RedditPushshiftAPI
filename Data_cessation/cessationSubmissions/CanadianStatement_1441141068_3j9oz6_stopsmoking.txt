I'll be seeing a lot of this subreddit in the next while, 3 cigarettes left and determined to quit.

Looking forward to corresponding with you. It will not be easy.

[Update: Girlfriend had to go out and buy a pack due to my behavior and is now rationing me like a squirrel.
She talked to her aunt (Nurse who specializes in helping people quit) and said a pack a day is too much to go cold turkey. 4 or 5 a day until it's not so rough on my body.]

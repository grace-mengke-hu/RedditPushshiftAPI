a new beginning

have been a smoker for 10 years and hate being one. Been trying to stop for about a year without success mainly due to making the same mistakes over and over again i.e. giving in when stressful situations occur or having that "one puff" when going out for drinks with friends...but now I'm sick and tired of an unhealthy lifestyle and therefore have decided I will stop smoking for good. No excuses, no fallbacks, I'm all in.

Trouble with sleeping

Hi, just wondering .. So after 10 years of smoking (it came to a point of smoking 20 cigs a day) i dicied to stop. I'm trying to cut down slowly and slowly... I'm now smoking olny 2-3 a day and over weekend 4 a day-(i started less than a week ago)  which i'm proud off because i thought i would never be able to do it. Anyway... Does any of you had trouble with sleeping ? Sinc i've start smoking 2-3 a day i can't sleep... I'm waking up 4-5 times because of my dreams ... Not scary.. But they are wierd :) hehe.. Sometimes it feels that i rather go back fully smoking and have a proper sleep than not having at all and feel tired.. would much appriciate if any of you had the same problem and could give some tips and help me with this so i won't break and keep going on cutting down to 0 :). Thanks :)

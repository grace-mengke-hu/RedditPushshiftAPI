Rubik's Cubes

Hello, I was looking for a cheap hobby to substitute for my addiction and love of math and computers. I found the Rubik's Cubes and twisty puzzles. You can find a lot of guides on Youtube and of course Google on how to first solve it. Or try a 2x2, it's easier and is how I started. Just search for the Beginner's method and you can find algorithms and how to solve it.

Then, look into CFOP for the 3x3 or other methods. Speed solving is a sport a lot like professional gaming, but I guess it's a lot older. Reddit has a subreddit called r/cubers (not sure how to link). It has a wealth of information and fun things to do with twisty puzzles that is pretty helpful.

I've been looking for some cheap hobbies to substitute my smoking. I tried writing, and I just began writing whatever, then kept looking and downloaded a Rubik's Cube app. I first figured out the 2x2 then moved up to the traditional 3x3. Then went out and bought one from Walmart, then bought a few advanced ones and here I am. It's been fun, my record is 40 seconds now. I really like my Megaminx and 2x2, and my 3x3 has magnets and lube that makes it work good.

Anyways, I hope this helps anyone with an addiction like mine. Cubing is a ton cheaper than smoking, as you can find some cheap cubes online for less than ten dollars. Good luck, happy quitting!

Quit 7/19 without even planning it.

So I've been looking at this sub for a while, seeing all the great posts and support. I had even made a quit day for myself back in April, though I never saw it through. So this Thursday night I had my last cigarette of the night, which was also my last cigarette in the pack. The next day I woke up and knew that I didn't have any to smoke as I always do first thing in the morning. I decided, NO, I will not smoke one now, and spent the rest of the day not smoking, now it's been a really really hard day because of this. I've been a pack a day for about 14 years at this point, and there were points were all I could think of was a cigarette, and when my brother mentioned smoking a cigar I think I literally salivated.

So I've made it through day one, and it's going to get harder before it gets easier, but I think I want to stay free of this for good. I have all you to thank for this, even though I lurked you still feel the camaraderie, and know that everyone here knows exactly what you're going through. Thank you guys!!

5th time trying. Just hit one month 20 minutes ago

They say it takes many tries to quit. In my case "they" were correct. I've been trying to quit for 10 years. This is my 5th and final attempt.
I've learned a lot from my 4 failed attempts which I think has helped a lot so I'm going to share my own experiences in hopes it might help others. I tried the gum first, then the patch, then champix and then tabex (with a few years smoking in between each attempt). I quit with tabex again this time because it is non NRT, all natural and way cheaper. Plus champix messed with my head a LOT. Below are the main things that helped me a lot this time.
1: You can lie to others but not yourself. All my quits I told my wife I hadn't smoked. And I was. You can lie to others but not yourself. Probably the most important lesson.
2: Having "just one" or "cutting back" makes is 1000 x WORSE. Trust me. Cutting back is terrible. You crave and crave and count minutes and seconds for as long as your "cutting back" phase lasts. I did it for 7 months a few years ago. Pure torture.
3: Just do it. I learned that I can't lie to myself. I learned that even 1 puff will not help my withdrawals at all but make them 1000 x worse and last longer. My "quit" where I was a closet smoker for 7 months? 7 months of hiding, and sneaking and of pure hell. That has motivated me big time to not cheat, not sneak in a puff.

I've been a long time lurker here... commented on some posts but never started one. Thank you to everyone here for letting me read your posts and encouragement :)

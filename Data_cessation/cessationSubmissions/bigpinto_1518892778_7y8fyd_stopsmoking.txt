lot of runny nose and sneezing

So its been four months since I quit and all the cough is gone, but still getting runny nose and sneezing - pretty much all day off and on, but its worst in the morning when I get up when I have to clear all the runny nose collected from night.

I have started walking briskly everyday too and it seems like all the walking I do recycles air through my lungs which makes me sneeze and blow nose a bit more after each walk.

My runny nose is clear except for specks of yellowish stuff every once in a while (and some blood every once in a while).

Wondering if this is just lungs continuing to clean themselves and how long it may last?

--- Still looking on the bright side - my bad luck is very good ---

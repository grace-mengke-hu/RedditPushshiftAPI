NEED SOME HELP!

I've been smoking for almost 5 years now, around 4-5 cigarettes a day. Tried to quit on multiple occasions, but failed. Yesterday I began yet another (and hopefully, final) attempt.

Can you guys tell me what's the best way to go about this? I'm trying cold turkey and damn, is it hard! Mostly after mealtimes, and in the night I have these sudden pangs of craving. I even have thoughts questioning whether it's all worth the trouble. Lighting up is just a small step away!

So, any advice would be appreciated!

Tomorrow is implant day!

I'm getting my implant tomorrow morning! Then we just wait 3 months for THAT to heal and then I can get my tooth.

Just wanted to say thanks to everyone who'e offered kind words and support through the last 47 days. If you hadn't all helped me quit, I never would have been able to get this implant. *group hug*

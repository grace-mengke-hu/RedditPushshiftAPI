Back to Day 1

So I broke today. December has been really hard and I'm 6 months into a career transition with no traction...

But I'm not giving up. I had one slip and that means I just have to quit smoking all over again. If I end up only having two in 365 days, that's about 3,000 less than before.

It is a struggle, but I'm confident this is on the way out. I just have to remember why I'm doing this.

Thanks /r/stopsmoking. You've been here in good times and bad times, and here's to making it past 169 days again.

Will expired Nicotine patches hurt me?

A bit of backstory - skip to the bold text to cut straight to the chase: 

I've been a smoker for over 15 years, and quit a number of times. The first time I managed to quit successfully for about 4 years. I used nicotine patches for about a month then just went cold turkey and replaced my habit with vigorous excercise. 

Due to increasingly tough personal circumstances around about the time when the GFC hit, I fell off the wagon and became a smoker again. After about a year or two of that, my body sent me several warning signs with hypertension, so I quit again, using the patch again. 

Here's the thing - I've been on the patch for around about 3 and a half years, for complicated reasons, but I'm not here to talk about that (unless you have questions). 

**My real question** :

**I just came across some old Nicotine patches from the first time I quit that are still sealed and unused. The packets, however, show an "Expiry" date of October 2004.  Can I use these without ill effects?** 

The dosage is the same as what I'm using now, but since patches are kind of a slow burn I don't want to find out slowly that they'll fuck me up. Any advice?

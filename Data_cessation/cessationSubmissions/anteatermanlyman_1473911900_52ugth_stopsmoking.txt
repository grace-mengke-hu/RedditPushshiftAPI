Venting about my total relapse

So, I don't know if you guys remembered me, but I was in the closet about a lot of things. I'm on a very low fixed income, have been for years, also paying rent on a room in a shared house. I'm also gay, and have been in a great relationship, but I've been open about that.

Anyways, the problem with trying to quit in these places is very difficult. There's always someone who doesn't know how to control their spending by always buying smokes. I have found smoking an e cigarette stops the smokers from offering cigarettes after a month or two, and twice I've gone without nicotine for a month and a half at this place. I smoke it in my room without anyone knowing with no damages and save money. I still hate not having any money though and end up quitting for a while, like I said.

But man, this last time was really bad. I was getting to the point where my boyfriend could control it and would give me smokes when I was about to buy a pack. One of my house mates just started handing me them to me one after the next. I had five cigarettes in an hour, and became so hooked. Now just a few days later, I'm sitting outside my boyfriend's house chain smoking the night away and what little money I saved from not smoking :(. I feel so dirty and poor again. I'm trying to sleep but the urge to smoke is defeating that.

And telling someone like this no is really hard. He's a fellon with lots of drug charges, and apparently he quit three years ago on all the hard drugs, so he doesn't feel like cigarettes are bad. But omg, he treats it like a drug deal, I can't stand it.

I'm gonna probably end up buying another e cigarette. Pisses me off that I'm doing this but I can't afford to smoke.

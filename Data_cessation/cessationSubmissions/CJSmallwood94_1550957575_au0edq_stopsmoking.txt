Out drinking with friends right now, and really want to smoke...

I've been out drinking for the last 5 hours or so with friends (a lot of them smoke) and I keep gettting a huge temptation to smoke a cig. I'm sure I'll feel guilty if I will,, but it's hard to shake the feeling that I want to.

And I really dont want to reset my Smoke Free app!

what happened to this sub?

this sub has been great, but lately does anyone else feel like we're getting much more new people in here who don't care about the community. I see a lot of badge-less people posting snide remarks that get upvoted all the time. no one really supports anyone anymore, and it feels like the ecigg crowd is spilling in here like crazy. i thought this sub was about kicking an addiction, but apparently i might be wrong. 

Just felt like ranting after what i've seen lately and was wondering if anyone else felt the same.

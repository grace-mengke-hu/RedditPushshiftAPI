My mother-in-law didn't know I was quitting

So she did the normal thing is she sometimes does and bought me a pack of cigarettes. So guess what I did? I smoked that damn pack of cigarettes and they tasted horrible and had been almost an entire week since I quit and now I just feel horrible and I'm sitting or crying almost and now I've got my Vuse e-cigarette and I know it's 48 mg per millimeter of nicotine but it's getting by and helping me a little bit and I'm smoking it only and is hurting my but with water I've got it figured all out . I'm sorry to rant about it's just I don't know what to do I'm miserable and ashamed

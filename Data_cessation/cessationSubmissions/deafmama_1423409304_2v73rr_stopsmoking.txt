Bragging rights

I find myself wanting to tell everyone that I've quit smoking. ALL.THE.TIME. I know there were several people who don't believe I'm going to stay quit, and others that are just tired of hearing me talk about it  yet AGAIN. On one hand, it's great that most of my friends and family are supportive. I'm shocked at some of the negative responses I've gotten, considering its coming from the same people that have given me so much crap for being a smoker! 
I know I can't expect everyone to join my parade, but I have been surprised by the few negative nellies so far. I'm staying  quit for me but there's a little part of me that wants to stay quit just to prove them wrong!

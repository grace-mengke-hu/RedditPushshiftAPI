Already caved before even hitting day 3, where should I go from here?

I feel awful, not sure why but something compelled me completely out of the blue to go buy a pack. I blame it on the fact that I have to cram a fuck ton of work in this week before a midterm for college. However ultimately it was my willpower that failed. Hopefully I can figure this out its to the point where I'm getting really fuckin sick of being controlled like this. What do you guys suggest, do I just act like this didnt happen? Or should I just continue until exams week is over when its a much more calm opportunity.

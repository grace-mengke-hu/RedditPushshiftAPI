Caught me by Surprise

Wow! Almost a month of quitting nicotine; Cravings and triggers was at its bare minimum past week all was going well and then boom I woke up happy today doing my work and the trigger just hit. It’s so so strong, Got so bad I could see myself going out the smoking area and getting a couple of drag. I’m just seating on my office desk and doing some deep breathing now. Really did not see this coming, wow

Does vaping count as not smoking?

I’ve quit smoking cigarettes over 2 weeks ago, but have recently started vaping to deal with cravings. It helps me a lot and at this point I’m convinced I won’t be going back to cigarettes (I don’t even miss smoking them). However I’m definitely still dependent on nicotine and wonder whether that means I’ve not made any real progress at all, and many of my friends haven’t taken my quitting seriously and commented that vaping is pretty much the same. Am I kidding myself that I’ve quit smoking?

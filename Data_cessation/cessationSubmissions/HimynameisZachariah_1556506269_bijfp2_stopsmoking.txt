One week tomorrow, feeling extremely depressed

Tomorrow I will have quit smoking for a whole week. This week has been tough and on my third day I felt terribly depressed all day. The same thing happened yesterday to a less extreme and on and off today. I don't know if this is because of not smoking or not but I used cigarettes as a coping mechanism for a lot of my emotions. Just curious if anyone else has had a similar experience and maybe had some advice.

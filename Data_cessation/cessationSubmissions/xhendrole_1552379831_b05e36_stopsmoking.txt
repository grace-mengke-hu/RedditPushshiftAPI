First couple hours.

I decided tonight to finally quit smoking. A couple of hours ago I opened a new pack of cigarettes and had one, and instead of waiting until my vacation next week to quit, I decided to give the pack to a coworker and stop then and there. I've gotta say giving up that pack and my lighter was much harder than I expected it to be. I just hope I'm ready for the long journey I've set out on.

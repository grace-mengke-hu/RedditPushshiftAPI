Okay I'm doing it.

Sorry pointless post but if somehow reminding myself I posted on reddit about it can help me fight the urges, there's still that. This is my last cigarette. Ive said it probably 500 times already but this time it's the actual last one. 

Good luck to you if you're quitting, I sure am right now.

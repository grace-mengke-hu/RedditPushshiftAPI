Every pack of cigarettes you buy could be a blanket made for Project Linus.

Fleece runs as low as $5 per 1.5yards at Joannâ€™s. Thatâ€™s the exact amount used to make a no tie blanket. So once you are smoke free and as long as your home was smoke free (the full rules are listed [here](https://m.projectlinus.org/app/faqs/2062513/36/) then you can start making blankets for sick and traumatized kids. If just doing it for your heath or to save money isnâ€™t enough motivation then do it so you can participate in charities like this one! Youâ€™ll also be keeping your hands busy when making them! Good luck on your quitting journey! ðŸ’š

After 10 years of smoking I woke up this morning and I know today is the day to stop, again, but for real this time

So far I have washed all of my clothes, bedding is next, I am cleaning everything in my house and car to get rid of that smell as much as possible, every time I want to smoke I go outside where I normally smoke and walk around taking deep breaths and thing about why it is time to do this. Today is day one and I know the excitement of choosing to stop will wear off and that this is going to be hard but smoking a pack a day is killing me and I need to be done. Any tips, advice, links to info is appreciated. Thank you all for being here and reading this,

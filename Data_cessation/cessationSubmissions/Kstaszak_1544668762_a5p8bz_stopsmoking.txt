Starting over.... yes again... I'm stupid... Day 1

So I made it to 21 days, then I decided that having a few on the weekend wouldnt be bad.... it wasnt bad.... it was horrible.... ended up in a bad mood on monday and decided to get back on the wagon.... I'm just passed 24 hrs now,  this isnt anything.... no cravings. I dont even know y I go back,  it doesnt do anything for me.... it's the memory I miss more then anything.... memory of fun times being young and care free.... that's not going to happen again so y do I torture myself with such thoughts?

First Night with No Cigarettes!!

This fucking sucks yo. I have been smoking cigs daily since July 2016 and this is the first night I don't have any.

I wont bore you with the details but I like to smoke weed and cigs together I feel like nicotine makes the high better or whatever.

Craving is a 10/10 yo.. right now feel like every 10 thoughts is one about cigarettes.

But lets do this shit! No more under the influence of substances just our normal selfs men

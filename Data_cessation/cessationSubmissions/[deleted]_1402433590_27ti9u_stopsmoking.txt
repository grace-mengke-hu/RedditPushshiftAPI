Day 5... and my E-Cig breaks.

Well this fight took a turn for the interesting. So now I can either cut my dependency altogether or I can get a new one... this will be the fourth e-cig I have ever owned that has crapped out on me so I think the time has come to just stop altogether... this only gets harder.

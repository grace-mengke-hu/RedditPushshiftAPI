Been about two weeks and I want one so bad.

A few weeks ago I got very sick. Smoking just made it worse so I had to stop until my throat healed. After 3-4 days though It seemed idiotic to light one up after the longest break in years... So I quit. Honestly it has been very easy. I think being so sick just completely scrambled my brain and I really don't have much for cravings EXCEPT for when I lay down to go to bed. Which is where I am now...wanting a smoke. I'm not going to but, talking about it helps a little I guess.

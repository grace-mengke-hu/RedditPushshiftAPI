Closing in on my first 24H and feeling pretty good!

Although i had some minor setbacks (maybe a total of 4 small drags on a friends cig, had a very stressfull day at work, i'm just proud i didn't break completely)

Positive side, was sitting at home, with some very strong cravings, so i took a 45 min run, i was coughing wheezing could barely breath, but i managede 3 km of switching between running and walking.. (used to run alot 8 years ago, even as a smoker my lungs weren't this bad, real eye opener) i even started doing sit ups and pushups when the cravings hit, honestly it works wonders for me, i feel at ease, relaxed and the stress decreased immensely.. 

Hoping for a better day tomorrow, definately gonna keep running every night..

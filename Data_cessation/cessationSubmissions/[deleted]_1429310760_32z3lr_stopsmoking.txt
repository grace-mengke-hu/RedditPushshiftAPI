Week two :)

Hello! Popping back in - I forgot all about updating my badge and all that good stuff. My quit day was 4/3/15. I switched to vape that day, and used 10mg/ml nicotine for four days, then 6mg/ml for 8 days, and cold turkey for the past two. My 0mg/ml juices came in today, so now I've got something fun to pass the time while I'm home from work.

I was a pack-a-day smoker for five years and it took me just two weeks to switch to something that not only smells and tastes better, but is better for my health, too. 

Plus, I get to fog up my apartment. :)

7 Days, the perfect start but ... smoking dreams?

I've quit smoking a few times before but I don't think I've ever felt so sure of myself as I do this time. I had been trying constantly and one night I decided to just get pissed, smoke a pack and plan EVERYTHING. I planned days, routines, alarms for every daily event with my own voice recordings and all sorts. So far I haven't had to rely on them, the main thing that has worked for me is waking up and doing yoga first thing in the day. But now I know that I have all of these things to fall back on, and voice notes to myself, I know that I don't have an excuse if I smoke again.

One thing I find weird though; I've never had smoke dreams before. I dream every night about dreaming about smoking, then I dream about waking up and feeling so empty because of the progress I've thrown away. Then I wake up and feel weird because it's a real dreamception. But I just wonder what other's experiences are with regards to smoke dreams; I don't crave at all, I'm thoroughly enjoying smokefree life, but these dreams are weird!

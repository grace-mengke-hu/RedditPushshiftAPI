My night cravings seem to be the only ones left, but they're pretty intense.

So every day is starting to get better, I can go to work and go home and rarely think about smoking, but as the sun goes down its like Jekyll and Hyde! Suddenly I REALLY want to go out and smoke! It's so weird. One night it got so intense that I finally bought that Allan Carr book and started reading it. The book helped a little but even reading the word "cigarette" was rough. I chalked up that really rough night to a bad case of PMS and stress, but the night time is still a rough time for me. Anyone else? How do you deal?

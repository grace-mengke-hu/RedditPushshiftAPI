Is this the right time to quit?

I’m feeling so miserable today, I’m at work (far from home) and fighting with my husband. Have been married for less than a year and it seems like isn’t going to work out. I can’t talk to anybody right now and I’m sitting in the bathroom crying and thinking about a damn cigarette... been smoking free for 1 day and 11 hours... sorry for all the bs, I’m just lonely and desperate

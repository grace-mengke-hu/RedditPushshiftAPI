Smoking and alcohol.

I stopped smoking on the 31st December and up until today hadn't touched a cig. Today while out drinking at a bar the more I drank the bigger the craving, I borrowed a cigarette from someone in the smoking garden. I'm so disappointed in myself, but I'm hoping it was just a drink thing. does anyone have any tips or advice for getting through a night of alcohol without smoking I'm have a girls night out coming up next weekend and I don't want to slip up again especially because thinks a propper night out not just a casual drink with colleagues after a meeting/training course with work.

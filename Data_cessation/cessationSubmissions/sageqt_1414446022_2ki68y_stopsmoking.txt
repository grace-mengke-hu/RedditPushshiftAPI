I want to quit again.

I feel like it can be tougher for me as I raised in a household of smokers.

Through my adolescence both my parents smoked (two households because of divorce). So I was exposed to second hand smoke through my youth constantly.

I'm 30 now and live with my father and I socially smoke with him now, I've been addicted again around two months.

It can make it difficult cause while I am at home I can step out in the garage and have a smoke break with him and I think he is too stubborn to quit.

I like Alan Carr's method and cold turkey but I feel like instead of constantly restoring the addiction like this.

** = craving
&& = relief

I think it's more like this

and the goal is this (nonsmoker)

Anyway I just ended up caving as I still have a pack of Newports in the garage. I lost a LoL match and there was arguing and ended up caving to a stress craving.

I'd like to make this my last pack and stop on the last one.

I can keep my badge if I finish before midnight. The white one for last...

If I ever have kids there is no way I would want to expose them to this habit.

Do people consider seeing cigarettes on TV as a trigger? I've been watching HBO series often and there is typically smokers on most shows.

Also like others I highly recommend the quitnow android app. 

Hopefully I can break free after 12 fags.

My worst cravings:

* After a meal
* After a ranked video game match
* After waking

Congrats to all those who made it to the care free zone (1 year+).

No more romance - today is the day.

I've been a social smoker the past few years; rarely ever buying my own pack. But the past few weeks have been rough. I started seeing a therapist and on antidepressants, but during the day, particularly at work, I get stressed. I started buying a pack every other day and going outside throughout the day to smoke when I become too stressed.

I'm not going to lie. I love smoking. There's a romantic association that goes along with smoking. i love the way I feel, instantly better, for a few minutes, but that's all it is. It's not a solution. It's also demotivated me from working out and jogging like I used to. I jogged today for the first time in a couple weeks and I couldn't believe how much better I felt. 

I quit as of this afternoon. I feel fine now, but I'm worried how I'm going to stand up to the stress of work or my own mind. Wish me luck.

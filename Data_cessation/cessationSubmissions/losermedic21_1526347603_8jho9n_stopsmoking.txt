6 and a half months and blew it

I made it 6 and a half months and blew it one night at work. Had the worst day I’ve had in a long time. It was one of those beautiful summer night where you just want to sit and smoke outside. So I did. I threw the pack away but now it’s all I can think about. Came so close tonight to smoking again. I’m going to keep going.

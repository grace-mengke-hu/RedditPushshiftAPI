3 weeks in after quitting cold turkey

and I'm fucking dying for a cigarette, hookah, anything... The first two weeks were surprisingly easy for me because I was also going through severe alcohol withdrawal. But now that my alcohol withdrawal symptoms have lessened I'm starting to crave a cigarette.. I watched girl interrupted with some friends today and was like, "good god is there any scenes in this movie that don't involve smoking??" Fuck, sometimes I wish I lived in the 60's, when smoking was good for you.

Quitting smoking = increased sex drive?

I quit smoking around a year ago and moved onto the e-cigarette. I've gradually weaned myself from 1.2mg strength to 3mg and 2 days ago to nothing. So far I don't feel too bad...I tried to quit from the 1.2 strength a few months ago and felt absolutely insane! This time around the main things I've noticed is I have a lot more energy..kind of nervous energy. Not anxiety I actually feel more positive strangely but like I have too much energy and its mildly uncomfortable. This has kept me from sleeping very well and I've had some very vivid dreams. 

The other thing I've really noticed is my sex drive is through the roof! Is this normal for nicotine withdrawal? I didn't get this when I quit cigarettes but I just feel extremely sexually frustrated despite any relief. I think my husband is a bit freaked / exhausted haha...sorry if too much information! I just don't ever remember this being a thing, if anything I'd expect low dopamine to = low sex drive?

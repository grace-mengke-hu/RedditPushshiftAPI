Day one complete, thanks to you.

I just watched the movie version of my fav book that I've been waiting for decades to see, prozac nation by elizabeth wurtzel. Very emotional, which is a trigger to want to smoke. Also people smoking in the movie, another trigger. So I decide to post here and share my feelings, rather give in and be a cig slave. Thank you sub, with your love and support, I really feel I can do it this time. Oxoxox

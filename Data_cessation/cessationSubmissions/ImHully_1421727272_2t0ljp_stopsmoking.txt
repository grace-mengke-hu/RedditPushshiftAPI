I've finally had enough, 8+ years ends now.

I have one cigarette left, it will be smoked right before bed. When I wake up tomorrow I'm done. I wrote the words last pack all over these Turkish Golds to prepare myself. I'm tired of being out of breath, I'm tired of stained teeth, I'm tired of not being able to smell or taste anything, I'm tired of spending over $5 a day on a terrible habit, I'm tired of my house and car and clothes smelling horribly, I'm tired of needing this crutch to live my life. I don't care how hard it is, I don't care how much it hurts, the side effects, the cravings, I don't care. As of tomorrow morning I'm smoke free. Fuck cigarettes, fuck nicotine. I've tried to quit so many times before, but I'm at the point now where I want it to happen so badly it hurts. No more games, no more I'll quit eventually, no more I'll quit after this or that happens. I will not be a lifelong smoker, I'm done. I'm so fucking done.

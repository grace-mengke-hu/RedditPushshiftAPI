How to eliminate the smell off my clothes?

This post isn't really about cessation of cigarette smoking, as I don't actually smoke cigarettes myself. I do however, live with someone who is an avid smoker (my mother). Growing up, I had a lot of trouble with smelling like cigarettes, as she'd always smoke in doors, and all over our apartment (including where my clothes were stored). In the last five years however, she's retreated to her room, rarely goes out, and smokes almost entirely in there. I figured this was the end of smelling like cigarettes, as most of the walls in our new place are not yellow. However, recently, someone asked me if I smoked. Apparently, they smelled cigarettes on my clothes. So my question is, can cigarette smoke travel across an apartment, even if you smoke inside a room with the door closed 95% of the time? And if so, how can I keep my clothing from smelling like cigarettes? 

EDIT : I forgot, she also kind of smokes in the bathroom. Not nearly as much as her room, but it's still consistent.

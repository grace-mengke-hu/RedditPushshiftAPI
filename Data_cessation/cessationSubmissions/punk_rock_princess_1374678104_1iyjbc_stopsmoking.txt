Day 4 and needing some advice.

So I am on day 4 of no cigarettes. I started last Thursday technically but Friday night I broke down and smoked :-/ But since then, I have not had a single drag. I am very very proud of myself, but I also worry. I am doing great thus far and I really don't want to smoke but I have about 4 friends that are not smokers or are ex smokers. How do you handle everyone in your life smoking when you are trying to quit?!? Even my boyfriend smokes, and I am trying so hard not to ask for drags or anything. Hints? Tips?

Good job

I just wanted say that on my quitting journey I have stopped in here many times.  I had started smoking again after almost three years of abstinence.   It can slowly creep back up on you.  I started a program that is offered for free where I am which has helped so much.  Also reading everyoneâ€™s encouragement to each other here has helped a lot!  just over three months free now!  I feel really good.  My 5k Time has improved so much!   Thank you everyone and keep supporting each other!

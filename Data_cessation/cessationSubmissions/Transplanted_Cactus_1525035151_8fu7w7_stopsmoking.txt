Is there a "better" time to quit?

I've smoked half a pack up to a pack a day off and on for 18 years. I'm moving back to my hometown in four months. I was considering making my quit date my move-in date. Fresh start, ya know? I'm incredibly happy about this move. But am I setting myself up for failure that way? I just feel like I've ran through all the quit smoking techniques, with poor results. 

Medication hasn't worked (I respond poorly to many of it, making my C-PTSD symptoms worse). I won't try Chantix knowing the side effects, I don't need *more* nightmares or suicidal thoughts. I've worked too hard to get those out of my life. 

NRT makes me nauseated and jittery, even at the lowest dosages. I've tried gum, lozenges, and patches. 

Vaping worked once, years ago, but I find it a huge hassle and money pit this time around and I still will, if given the choice, take a cig over vaping. 

I have no issues breathing, no smokers cough, so it's hard to think "Well I'll feel better if I stop." Never had any noticeable increase in ability to smell or breathe when I've quit in the past. 

History of serious drug, alcohol, and nicotine addiction on both sides of my family. Thanks, genetics. 

C-PTSD and all the fun that comes with it (anxiety, panic attacks, etc).

I'd like to not die of cancer, but so far, the addiction has won out over my fears. I've even tried having a disgusting cancerous lung as my phone's background.

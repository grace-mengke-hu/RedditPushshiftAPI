DAE starts getting cravings only after hitting a time mark?

Hi all,

I have been tobacco free for 112 days, the beginning was surprisingly easy. However recently been getting some CRAZY cravings. I want to smoke so much!!

Because the beginning was easy I didn’t have to learn to manage cravings, also didn’t write down the reasons why I quit. Now I can’t think of any specific reasons of quitting and I DID have tons of them!! Should have written them down, other people pls don’t make my mistake!!!

I started smoking in early teenage years, and for the new year I want to start learning things for a career change. All my past learning has been done with the help of nicotine. Now I can’t start learning, feel stuck and want to smoke! Help!!

Any advice would be highly appreciated!! Thanks in advance!!

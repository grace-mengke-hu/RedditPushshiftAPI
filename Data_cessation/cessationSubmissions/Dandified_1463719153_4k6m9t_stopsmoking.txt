Birthday Presents

In a week I will turn 35. I started smoking when I was 15 and with some minor interruptions have smoked since.  I quit about 6 days ago and things are going great so far. 

I keep imagining that day I started. And how ridiculous it would sound to say "OK, I like this, I'll give it 20 years then that's it"  What an insane amount of time. Well, that time is up.  20 years. If I don't stop now...when? 20 YEARS!  

I'm done. Feels good man.

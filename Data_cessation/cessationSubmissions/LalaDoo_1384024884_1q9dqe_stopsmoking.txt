Four Days in...

The past four days have taught me that I am very emotional without cigarettes which was definitely not the case while i was smoking. My SO called me today to tell me he finally found a job after being unemployed since June and I started crying. That's completely out of character for me and all I wanted in that moment was to smoke to mellow myself out. Thankfully, I don't have any cigarettes left. The wifi where I live doesn't work in my room so I have to go outside to use the internet. Outside around the smokers. That's proven extremely challenging as well. I am definitely proud of myself for not giving into the temptation and I want to thank all of you on the subreddit for your encouraging words and posts. Knowing that strangers are going through the same withdrawals and having the same thoughts as I am definitely is making the journey easier.

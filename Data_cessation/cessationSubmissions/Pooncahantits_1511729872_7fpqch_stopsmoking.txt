How to help a loved one quit

Hey all, thanks for checking out my post. 

My SO has been smoking since he was 15 - more than 15 years. He was at a pack a day before he started to quit again this weekend. 

He has spent most of his time in bed. I've seen people go through withdrawals from opiates and honestly it looks like he is in the same place. His body and throat hurt, he is frustrated and restless and also has food cravings.

He has to go back to work tomorrow, and I don't know how anyone could possibly function like this. 

How can I help? Are there supplements that can help ease his symptoms? I'm assuming a lot of you are experiencing or have been through this. Is there any way I can make his journey easier?

Thank you so much! Very proud of him and everyone on this board who are trying to better themselves.

7 days from a month cold turkey...

I started the year went 6 months no smoke. Picked up on my Mary Jane habit around June, dropped it about 2 weeks later, but kept the Black and Mild habit until October 12th. Since then I have been smoke free but it has been a struggle.

Many times I have almost tricked myself into one more Black and Mild but I have endured the temptation. I woke up from a nap a little while ago and Makers Mark with a black and mild was on my mind. I almost gave in. Then I got on the computer and found this sub reddit.

So here I am. Sharing with you all with the hopes of gathering the strength to make it 1 year, then 5 years, then 10 years, to infinity and beyond without that 1 more black and mild. 

To everyone quitting and that has quit be strong and of a good courage!

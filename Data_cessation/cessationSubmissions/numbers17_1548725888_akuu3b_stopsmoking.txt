I havent quit smoking yet, but I want to. I was hoping for some tips.

Let me give a breakdown. 

I've smoked for 10 years and I feel like Ive tried everything. 

My wife and I had "the talk" again about me quitting.  I'm aware what it does to my body, our money, and what kind of role model I'm showing the kids.

Ive tried gum and that didnt really work at all.

Ive tried patches and that's a non starter cause I have a bad reaction to it.

Outside of actually just taking chantex I feel like I tried and it like the beast on my back that digs its claws in even harder if I even think about quitting. I hate smoking. I hate having to take a break from my family time just cause that beast has dug in its claws. I feel weak because there are so many people who have done it and I feel like my efforts were half assed at best. I even picked up that book the "Easy Way to Stop Smoking" but I barely gave it a glance. I think a part of me doesnt want to give up that comfort ( though I know that comfort is an addiction and a lie). 

The acknowledge and logically think that yes it'll be hard and yes there is nothing that will make it easy. That's my weakness is just not wanting to go through that. 

Anyway, I hope this can help cause I think I need to set a quit date and I just need to be done. Cause there can't be one more ever.

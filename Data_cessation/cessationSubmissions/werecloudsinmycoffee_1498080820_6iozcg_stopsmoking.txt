Relapse and those crazy emotions

Hi Reddit!

I quit smoking on the fifteenth of May this year and what followed was almost exactly two weeks of insanity. I was incredibly emotionally volatile, quick to anger and cried quite a lot. I read a lot about how nicotine withdrawal can cause you to be a little unbalanced. 

All that cleared up and the next two weeks were fine, unfortunately I relapsed for a few days afterwards. I smoked every day for about a week. 


I've since quit again (one week today, woo!) and I'm wondering if I should expect those intense emotions to come back again after a relapse? I've been a little up and down but also have a lot of other stressful factors in my life right now!

Also to anyone thinking of quitting, once you get through it and the fog clears, its worth it!

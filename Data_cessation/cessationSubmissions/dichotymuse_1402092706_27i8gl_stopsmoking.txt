Unforeseen side effects of not smoking

Hi there! Thanks for all of the support, it helps to browse this page to remind me of why I quit in the first place.

There is another upside to quitting that I didn't even think about: every activity that I participate in feels more leisurely now. I am never in a hurry to finish something so I can go have a smoke. Never realized how much my life was being controlled until I quit! I don't need some silly useless product to tell me when I am going to start or stop doing something. Never again! 

Have a good, smoke-free day guys.

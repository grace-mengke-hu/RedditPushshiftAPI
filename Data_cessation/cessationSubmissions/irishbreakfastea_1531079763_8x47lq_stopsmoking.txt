I am committing today to never smoking again

I began this journey back in January.  I have had so many slips I have lost count.  I am sick of going back and forth.  Today I threw all my cigarettes out.  Its such a waste of time smoking, I wasn't even happy when I was doing it.  All of these slips have taught me an important lesson, smoking is never worth it.

I have nicotine gum on hand, but I honestly don't want to use it.   I have had bad experiences with quitting cold turkey so I suppose I will allow it if I must.

I can't keep going on being a smoker.  It's effecting my relationship.  My fiancee and I want to have a child and she is refusing to go through with having a child with me until I quit.  That makes me feel pathetic.  I need to do this.  Not tomorrow, not in an hour.  Now!

Just wanted to share my commitment.  I know logically that having slips in the past is not a predictor of my future success.  I have quit before in my life and it took a hell of a lot of tries, but once I really committed to it I was able to quit.

My life is on the line guys. I'm doing this.  I quit!

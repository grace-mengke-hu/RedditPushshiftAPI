craving a cigarette when quit

I've not had a cigarette for 10 days now and I've had cravings but none as bad as today I really felt like going buying a packet but I knew it wasn't worth it I thought it would get easier as days went on but today has definately been the worst. I just feel like there's something missing all the time lol I know it sounds stupid ! does anyone else get like this?

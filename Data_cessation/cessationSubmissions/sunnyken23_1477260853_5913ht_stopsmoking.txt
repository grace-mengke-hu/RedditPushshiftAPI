Anyone quit weed and cigarettes at once

I quit weed for 7 days but was unable to quit cigarettes although I did cut down a lot.  I relapsed on the weed on the 8 th day and with that started smoking even more ( for 9 days ) at least 12-20 a day  .  
I don't know really why I wasn't able to quit last week , but I am at the end of day 1 for the weed , I smoked 4 cigarettes today. I can already feel the longing for tomorrow's morning cig. 


 What to do ?

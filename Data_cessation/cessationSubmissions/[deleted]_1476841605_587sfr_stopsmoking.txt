I wish I could impart my experience on you all so you'd understand that there is a light at the end of the tunnel. I remember quoting, it was maybe the 100th time I said "this is it" but it happened. I wore a nicotine patch for a week then went cold turkey. I had trouble for about a week or two, but I managed to get over it. It's been 3 years, I want you all to know that it gets so easy that you forget you ever even quit, you forget you were ever even a smoker. You can smell the scent of a freshly lit butt and enjoy it without feeling attached or craving, you can get drunk without falling back on it (though I wouldn't recommend doing that for a while) it gets so easy that you won't even care anymore. The single defining factor to your success of quitting is really simply a matter of "are you serious?" I really did "quit 100 times", I thought I was serious each time, but the last time I meant it. I didn't do anything different, there aren't any tactics or distractions that you can abuse to alleviate the stress, I just dealt with it. It only sucks for about a week, honest to god. Don't look for a way out, don't look for a substitute, don't make excuses, just accept responsibility for your current stress and let go. You have to stop clinging. If you're really struggling - remember it's never as satisfying as you imagine it will be. It always seems like it's the answer, it seldom is. Be patient, it's already almost over.

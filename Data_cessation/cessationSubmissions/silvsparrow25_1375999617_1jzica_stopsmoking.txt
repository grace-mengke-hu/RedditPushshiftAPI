Quit attempt #3456....er somewhere around there!

Hello all, just subscribed to this thread on my quit day. Hoping to find some support and ideas as I am hoping to stay quit on this attempt for as long as I possibly can. I've tried all sorts of methods in the past and this time will be using nicorette gum only for strong cravings with a blend of diet change and exercise thrown in for good measure. 

Suggestions for what will help the first week are very much welcome!

Tips for making it through moments of struggle?

I've started to quit countless times but I am very good at picking some negative (job, family, life, etc) thing that happens in the following days and focusing on it until I give in and smoke again (as if that's going to help). 

Does anyone have any good tips on how to pass through these periods of negativity and get through to the next one?

50 days check in

Hey guys,

Just wanted to let you know about my progress. 

This is the third time, after almost 6 years of pack-a-day smoking that I reached 50 days. There was always a 1 year gap of smoking between those attempts. I'm 21, in case you are curious.

The first time I did it because I wanted to see just how much I can last. Apperently about two months. The second time it was because my girlfriend *asked* me to (note I said asked, not forced) and I wanted to be considerate. Then we were at a wedding 2 months later and she said that I could smoke if I wanted to and that's all the motivation I needed to start smoking again. 

However, now it's the first time I quit because *I wanted to* and I honestly have no intention to start smoking again. The previous times I always felt like I had to, I secretly hoped I would have an excuse to start smoking again. Now every time I have a craving, I think "I'm not letting *5 fucking minutes* of pleasure *ruin almost two months of progress* and get depressed because of it, it's retarded".

Almost forgot, always cold turkey, no help, no just a puff, nothing.


A few points and suggestions:

- Don't avoid other smokers, you can't avoid them forever, learn to live with them.

- Don't avoid drinking because you are afraid that your drunk self will want to smoke. Your drunk self is still you, being drunk is not an excuse to act stupid. 

- Your house, clothes and breath don't smell like shit anymore, but you will need some time to be able to smell just how horrible smokers stink. Jesus, is that how I smelled all that time? That's emberassing.

- The only reason to stop smoking is because *you* made that decision and you decided *why*. You will be torturing yourself if you are quitting for the wrong reasons.

- The money isn't really a motivation, because you will always find something else to spend them on, but while you may not "save" money, you will find yourself "having more money around". Basically you will spend more money on other shit, but at least it won't be cigarettes.

I guess that's it, if I think about something else I will edit and add it.

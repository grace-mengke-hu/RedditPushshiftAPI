Day 17 - Sore throat, coughing, and hacking shit up.

So for about ten days, I have had a sore throat, runny nose at night, and super bad cough throughout the day and really bad at night.  I wake up in the morning and just hack so much nasty shit out and occasionally drops of blood.  Just wondering if this is normal, am I sick, or what.  I have a follow-up doctor appointment this Monday, but I thought I would see if this happened to fellow ex-smokers.

Thanks guys :)

THANK YOU! I don't think I would be where I am with my quit without all of your help on this sub. I check here every day and you guys have seriously been a tremendous help. I was a pack a day smoker for 9 years and quit cold turkey. Never would I have thought that I would make it 3 weeks without a cig. I already have no desire to go back to the filthy habit.. So again, thank you guys, we can all do this. Cheers to a smoke free life!

Went camping without cigarettes!

This might sound dumb, but I was pretty worried about this Yellowstone camping trip.  Not so much on the trail, but around the fire late at night.  Sitting by the fire with a cigarette is still on my list of favorite memories, and I was sooo relieved to discover that it was, indeed, not the cigarette that made the time so enjoyable.

It was so lovely to know that I was smelling so much more than I usually would - though holy cow the smell of campfire on our clothes is overpowering!!  The crisp cold air in the morning smelled so clean and delicious, I was proud and happy to get to experience it properly.  I've never (even before smoking) had much of a sense of smell, but going from smoker to nonsmoker has definitely brought some of it back!

I was also surprised at how few people were smoking in the park.  I had my vape, and stood by the smokers posts, but rarely saw anyone else there.  Saw literally noone who spoke english - all the very few smokers were foreign tourists.  


Three weeks tomorrow - ain't that some shit!

Just here to say hi and give everyone a positive thought!

After almost 600 days of quiting smoking, I wanted to post here again.
Still going strong and no need for cigarettes back in my life :-)
Last weekend my dad had a minor heart attack and it was again the biggest reasson to not smoke.

Let's start 595 days ago:
1st of October (Stop-tober). I had enough "courage" to stop smoking and less good reassons to continue smoking. So that day I quited.
First days were like everyone experiences but I kept my mind on the advantages of not smoking anymore.

Now back in the pressent: I don't feel a lot of advantage except when I notice that I have quit a good condition. I started fencing almost at the same time. I train 2 times a week for a couple of hours. I also go biking if the weather allows it for good distances.

So in the end:
If you really want to quit, you can do it!
If you have quited: stay strong. Always remember how you were while you did smoke and how your doing now.

And once in a while, come back here to help out others with their journey.

Here we go again....

So a week before my two years of quit (June 1st) I started smoking again. Not just one here and one there, full on 1 to 1 1/2 packs a day. My breathing got crappy again quick and the nasty taste in my mouth was back. So today I put the patch on. I feel fine. No real cravings except when I was driving I thought about one. 
So I go to the college, as I am almost 30 and sick of being poor, to check on my financial aid. I find out that it's very unlikely that I will receive assistance as my husband and I made too much last year. We don't make the same amount now as we moved back to our hometown. So I am bummed. I'm not really wanting to smoke I'm just pissed off. Plus I have a staff meeting at 8pm tonight, on my only day off this week. Just in a pissy mood. I know smoking won't make it better and I am rather proud of myself for realizing that. 
I am hoping it stays easy. I have only been smoking for 2 months. Fingers crossed that the non smoker me didn't go too far away! Thanks for letting me vent!

Once more.

Hey there, fellow quitters. I've done this a couple of times before, but have always slipped back into the tar pit.

What's different on this time around is that I'm going into this with the Easyway method. It seems to make the most sense of all methods to me.

This is my day four. Had my biggest cravings so far, seems to be related the weekend. You know, relaxing - not stressing about minute details like whether you smoke or not. ;-) I find the closest I am to a relapse, my mind goes into this "it won't work. It never did and it never will"-mode of thinking. I have to really struggle to beat those thoughts down and replace them with 1)reasons I just effin quit!:D(which just disappear on those moments) and 2) the purely logical idea that whatever happened before does not dictate what happens now.

So I'm so far so good I think. My biggest trials will be the times I get drunk... It's always involved smoking, so there's a habitual preference towards it and also the effects alcohol has on impulse control and all-around sensibility make those times tricky indeed. So I'm trying to avoid those situations for a while now... :)

Hope everyone is going strong. Keep at it!

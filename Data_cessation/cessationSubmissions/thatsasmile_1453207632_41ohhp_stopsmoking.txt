I am ready to quit.

I am a smoker, a serious one. First thing I do when I wake up is light up a cig.
I smoke alone, I smoke with other people. If I can't smoke in a pub or at friend's home I just rush outside to have a cig here and then.
I am a smoker since I was 18 (now I am 30), it makes 12 solid years.
It is time (again and this time once for all) to stop this awful, deadly, unpleasant addiction.

I know every pro of quitting, I know how to do it because I've already did once (for 11 months!), I just wanted to share with you that this decision is on and as many of you I am starting this path to be healthier ;)

Cheers

St.Patty's day

As the saying goes "I can resist everything but temptation". So I've been holed up avoiding social situations where I would be tempted to smoke (managed work well so far), but kinda going stir crazy & it's St.Pat's. 

I guess what I'm asking is what do you do to not smoke when out at the bar with smokers?

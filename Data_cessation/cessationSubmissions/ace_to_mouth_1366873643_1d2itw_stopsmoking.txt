I went 16 days and then I broke

It had been 16 days up until yesterday. Everything seemed like it was going so well, but then the stress of final exams caught up to me and I broke down and bought a pack. I felt like such a failure at the counter asking for a pack and I regret it now. Hopefully tomorrow will mark the beginning of the actual end this time.

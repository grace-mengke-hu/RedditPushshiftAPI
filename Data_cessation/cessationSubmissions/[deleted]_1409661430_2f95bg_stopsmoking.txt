Today marks 7 days of not smoking!

About 2 weeks ago I broke my jaw and a last Wednesday I had to have surgery to put a plate in. Ive been a smoker fr about 6 years and I wasn't allowed to smoke for the first few days after surgery but since then I just haven't picked it back up and all of a sudden its already been a week. I have kinda replaced it with pain killers but im sure I can get off them when I need to.... haha anyways thought id make it official to keep myself on track!

The time away as a non smoker

Flying as a non smoker means you arent self conscious about how you smell to your neighbor.

Upon landing you are not one of the people on row 28 standing up impatiently while people in first class are wrestling bags from the overhead bin- cursing them under your breath for being so slow. 

It means you can deplane and look for the way to you're hotel, not a safe and polite place to smoke.

It means that after a flight, a subway ride, a seven block walk with luggage and an elevator lift to the 12th floor you can just sit down and enjoy the view- no annoyance that there isn't a balcony or need to travel up and down for a fix. 


It means that when you wake the next morning you don't have to shamefully head down to the ground floor before a proper coffee or dress. 


For all its struggles, there are definite perks. 

Hope you all will not smoke with me tomorrow.

This time it's the real deal.

Okay, so I know at time of posting my badge says 505 days, but I have reset it to 6 days. Honestly, I stopped browsing this sub, and returned to smoking. About two months ago, I decided to get serious again. I bought a nice vape (thanks everyone in /r/electronic_cigarette!), and went from a pack-per-day to one-per-day overnight! On the 19th, I smoked my last cigarette before going to bed, and then left in the morning to fly out to New York City to visit my family. While I was there, I was surrounded by smokers, and I even drank (which is definitely a huge trigger for me). I didn't even have a single craving to smoke a cigarette while I was there. All I did was vape when I felt like tasting that delicious blackberry liquid. So far, I'm feeling great! These last two months (the last week especially), I've felt the best I have in years! Just wanted to share, and let you guys know, you're awesome.

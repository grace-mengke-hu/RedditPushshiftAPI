Cravings, but only certain times of day...

The cravings are worse in the early mornings, before dawn. When I got up this morning, and by morning I mean the middle of the night, all I wanted to do was go outside into the dark and smoke. It’s easier in the day when the sun is out, and it’s always sunny here, especially when the weather gets warm. It’s kind of like Hell. I hate the sun, I have no desire to get any sun or go out in the heat (anything over sixty degrees is hot to me) to smoke. During the day it has to be very cloudy, stormy, something like that and then I want to go out. But it rarely rains here, so I am not worried about that.

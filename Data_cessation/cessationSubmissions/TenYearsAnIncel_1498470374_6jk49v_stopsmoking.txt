First time poster. One month in.

Hello,

I've been lurking here for a few months and recently I finished reading Allen Carr's book. I've quit now for a month so the nicotine is definitely out of my system. Last week I had a very stressful week and had a strong desire to buy a pack but I abstained. Just wanted to share my success and hope.

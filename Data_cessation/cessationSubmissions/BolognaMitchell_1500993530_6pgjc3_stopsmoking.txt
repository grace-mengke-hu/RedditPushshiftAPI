Slightly more than two week check-in

I'm feeling good about this quit. Just got back from a 3-day whitewater rafting trip with a bunch of people I went to college with, most of them were smoking the whole time and I made it through the whole trip without even stealing a drag off of someone! I only really thought about it a couple times all weekend. I'm pretty proud of myself for that.

Also, I was worried that not being able to smoke would ruin my raft trip, but instead I think it actually made it more fun. These things are a lot of work -- you have to haul a lot of gear around and you're in the blinding sun all day, but I felt like I had more energy than usual. I know that's because I wasn't smoking.

Quit three days ago

I've been a back a day smoker for about 5 years now(27 now). I feel like I'm young enough I can recover, but either way getting winded when I was playing with my nephews was just a huge wake up call. I've tried to quit before but have always slipped back into it since I didn't have a good reason to quit.

The cravings are intense, but I'm fighting through it. The insomnia is kicking up for me but I know that there's a light around the corner where it's going to be better. I want this post to help me be accountable for my actions, I think it will help me.

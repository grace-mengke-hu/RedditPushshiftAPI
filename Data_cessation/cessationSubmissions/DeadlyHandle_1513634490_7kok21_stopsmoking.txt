I smoked today

I've been smoke free for a little over a month. I did break down and smoke a few on day 7 and had one I got from a friend a week ago but when I had one marb menthol today(this was my cancer stick of choice) I noticed how disgusting it tasted and how much it hurt to inhale. I can't believe I was doing a pack a day... I couldn't taste it's nasty flavor or feel it's rough texture on inhalation because I did it so much. I never really noticed my sense of taste or feeling coming back but wow have things changed.

The only problem is how much better I felt emotionally. I'm kind of a wreck without it to relieve stress &amp; anxiety

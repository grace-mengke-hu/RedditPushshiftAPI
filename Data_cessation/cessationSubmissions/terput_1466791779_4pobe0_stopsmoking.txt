Just saying "hi" b/c I think announcing it will help me in my efforts

Hey y'all.  Just a hello/ hi/ thanks for this community.  I quit 11 days ago, and I bought a vape the day I quit.  I've been using it since and it's actually working WAY better than I ever thought it would - besides a craving when I was pretty hammered last weekend, I have had zero desire to smoke. 

I have tried to quit in the past, though, and it was exactly this feeling of being "freed" from cigarettes that ended up trapping me in the end.  I managed to stop for a few months and then thought "oh, it's cool, I'm not really a smoker anymore, 1 won't hurt." The cigs snuck back and got worse and worse. 

I am scared this time because I really want this to be permanent.  I know a lot of smokers try several times before succeeding, and I am joining this forum so that I can be reminded on a daily basis that this is a battle that will go on for the rest of my life: I can never say "oh, it's cool, I'm no longer a smoker" before taking a drag of a cigarrette.  I must always think of myself as at risk for starting again.  I must always remind myself about why I am stopping and why I must continue to not smoke. 

anyways, that's all.  I'm so glad this resource is here. 

EDIT: Thank you so much for all the comments!   the encouragement is awesome!  definitely bookmarking the page.

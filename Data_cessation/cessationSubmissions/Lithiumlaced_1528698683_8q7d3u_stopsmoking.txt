Day 0

I told myself i would quit when i had my last assignmenr done. Its done, but not submitted (ill do that later tonight). Here in New Zealand my usuals are now $24.50, i smoke 3 packs a week. I'm all out now, i threw out my lighter too. What's helped you get through the first few days? My biggest concern is what will i do with all my free time?!?!? Weird, i know, most people love the extra time

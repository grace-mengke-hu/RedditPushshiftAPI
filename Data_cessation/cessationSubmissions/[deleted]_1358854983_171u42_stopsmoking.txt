Over a month! Relatively easy indeed but still miss the activity. Now on to /r/leaves!

The counter says 38 days now! I stopped a few days before I found /r/stopsmoking and the Easy Way book but after reading it I found my motivations aligned well with it: that smoking does nothing good for you.

I'm happy with the result so far, the only thing I miss a bit is the option of instant gratification in moments of lameness. Used to be so easy to light one up when I felt bored, which happened a lot. 

Probably because I still kept near-daily evening toking, now instead of big tobacco boosted joints I switched to pure. Amsterdam weed is strong indeed so they got to be small mini reefers which limited the long luxurious toking experience of before. 

With that gone as well it made me more then aware of how stupid a habit toking is so it got to go as well. Maybe the extra energy from quitting tobacco did it! :)

So it's on to /r/leaves! They don't have the badges like we have, maybe I'll get me a 'dont break the chain' type of printed calender instead, seems to work.

Oh, I'm a coffee junky now, I think about the stuff and have to manage it. And nuts and dried fruit mixes, chomping bags of it! Though I was terribly underweight before I now gained 8 kilo in these 38 days. Still under 'normal' BMI but it needs some attention as well, it would suck to switch the likely-cause-of-death from lung cancer to heart disease. 

It's always something innit?! :)

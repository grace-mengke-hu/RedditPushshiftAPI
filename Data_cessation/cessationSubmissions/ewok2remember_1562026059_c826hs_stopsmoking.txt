How do you deal with the smell in your car?

I'm only a couple of days into a new quite. I'm really struggling, but desperately want it to last this time, as I graduate college in a year and want to be free of cigarettes for my last two semesters. Anyway, to the point of the post, how did any of you manage the smell of your car? Mine smells like an ashtray. Shame, because it's not a bad car. But the smell drives me crazy, making me both disgusted and craving. Any tips for making my car smell better?

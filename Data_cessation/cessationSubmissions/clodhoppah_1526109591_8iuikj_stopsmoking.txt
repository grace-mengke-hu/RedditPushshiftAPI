25 days and 18 hours

This week seems to be the hardest. Iâ€™m craving more than any other week for some reason. I thought it was meant to get easier as time goes on?! ðŸ˜– 
Had a little get together last night for my partners birthday and I was the only non smoker there. There was about 15 or so people. It was difficult but I didnâ€™t have one and Iâ€™m pretty proud. 
This afternoon my partner has some mates around to watch the football and they all smoke too, the smell of smoke wafts into the house and it stinks really bad. I jumped in the car and went for a drive just to give myself some time out.

Finally able to not smoke again and it feels wonderful.

Okay, so here it goes. I just want to put this down in text to kind of get it off my chest. I quit last year for a year almost to the day. Well, sort of.  I would smoke a cigarette every now and then when drinking but still considered myself a non-smoker. I had smoked for 10+ years previously so one every now and then didn't count in my mind. Then I went to New Orleans over Memorial Day weekend this year and was like fuck it, I'm smoking. I'll stop when I get home. I smoked probably six packs in four days while I was there. When I get home I couldn't stop. I'd sneak a couple smokes every day, then I decided I'd just smoke at work. No big deal. Yeah right. Well that developed into my old 1.5 pack a day habit. I had to quit. I just can't control myself with cigarettes. I had stopped enjoying running, I was getting out of shape again and just generally feeling like shit.

My mom's best friend's husband was diagnosed with brain cancer at the beginning of October. He went through surgery for it. Then my fianc√©es dad was diagnosed with lung cancer on Monday and went immediately into surgery. I was in shock. I smoked the last cigarette of my life on Tuesday. I know I can't control myself. I know there are consequences and see them with my own eyes. Fuck these things. 

The main thing I know from quitting smoking a couple times now is how little you enjoy things while smoking. Your concentration is on nothing 100%. While not smoking you want to be smoking and while you're smoking you kind of wish you weren't. Everything is kind of muted. It's the worst, most fucked up habit I've ever had and I'll never touch one again. I'm already feeling back to myself from last year where I didn't smoke. I'm already enjoying running again and I'm not even thinking about smoking that much. Anyway, good luck to anyone trying to quit. You're better than these death sticks. You can do this.

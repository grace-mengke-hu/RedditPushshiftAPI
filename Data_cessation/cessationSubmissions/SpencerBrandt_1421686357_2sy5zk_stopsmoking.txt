Day 2.

So this sucks. I've got mood swings and random spurts of energy. I woke up this morning and my throat hurts like I smoked a pack in an hour. I'm hungry but can't eat, and I only got a few hours of sleep. 
But I've been reading other people's stories, and knowing I'm not the only one feeling like this? Fuck smoking. I can do this!!

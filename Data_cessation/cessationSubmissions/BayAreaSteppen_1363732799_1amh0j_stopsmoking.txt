Recommendations for other "oral fixation" substitute for a Pipe Smoker. 

My dad want't to quit and confesses a lot of his pipe smoking simply has something to do with having something to chew on while he's reading/writing etc. I'm thinking there is gum, I've herd those disposable dental floss things are good, I'm not trying to get the guy hooked on hard candy. Any idea's? I'm thinking of getting him one of those e-vapes in pipe form.

35 days smoke-free - thanks /r/stopsmoking

35 days ago, I quit smoking with the help of the "Stop Smoking" app and electronic cigarettes.


I've been tempted many times and almost caved once when, very drunk, I asked a mate for a roll-up. Fortunately, I'd told him that I'd recently stopped smoking and he Jedi-mind-tricked me:


Me: Please will you make me a roll-up?

Him: You don't want a roll-up.

Me: I don't want a roll-up...Please may I have a drag on yours?

Him: You don't want a drag on mine.

Me: I don't want a drag on yours. 

Him: You want to smoke your electric thing because it tastes like raspberries.

Me: ...I want to smoke my electric thing because it tastes like raspberries.


I don't cough when I wake up anymore. I don't wake up in the night with a tight chest. I don't run out of breath climbing the stairs. 


I *do* notice the smell of smoke on people when they've been out for a cigarette, and I always thought that I didn't smell after having a cigarette...apparently I was wrong.


Food tastes better.


Hangovers are less debilitating.


I've added three (comfortable) semitones to the top of my vocal range.


I will decrease the nicotine strength of the vape (as I feel like I'm 'cheating' at the minute) and eventually stop all together.


I've not posted much in here, but I don't think I'd have done it without this subreddit. Reading everyone else's struggles and successes has made me feel less alone in the journey.


So...thank you :)

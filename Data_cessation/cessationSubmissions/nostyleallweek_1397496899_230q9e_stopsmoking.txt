21 Years a Smoker - 7 Days 20 Hours 24 Minutes clean

I just turned 34 a few weeks ago, and a few weeks before that I'd realized that my smoking habit had just had its own birthday and now was old enough to drink.  I initially started "quitting" - or at least making an effort to do so - about two weeks ago with the aid of Nicoderm CQ.  Between birthday drinking and the habit I'd cheated by buying a pack of smokes, taking a few drags of the first one, and then throwing the pack away; but this didn't last long and soon enough I stopped throwing the packs away and was back to a pack a day.

I'd tried Chantix and Wellbutrin previously with mixed success, but the longest I'd ever been smoke-free was five months.  This time around I'm sticking to the patches since they definitely do help with cravings / withdrawals (the only two times I *really* want to smoke are when drinking or when I forget to put a patch on in the morning), and I'm using the Smoke Free app on my phone.

My jaw is sore from all the gum I'm chewing, but I can already breathe a little easier. My tongue is less coated throughout the day from smoking drying out my mouth, people have told me my skin looks better and that I don't reek of stale smoke anymore.  Honestly the only gripe I have is looking at this damn app and seeing that it's *only* been 7 Days 20 Hours and ... 31 Minutes.  I want this to say I've gone a Month, a Year, a Decade smoke-free - like, NOW.

With that said, given that my habit was roughly $10/day if anyone has a time machine they'll sell for $70 - $80 please contact me yesterday.

Got drunk last night

Got drunk at my cousins wedding last night, and didn’t smoke! Didn’t really get an urge to either. Everyone’s different, but when I first stopped smoking, I didn’t drink for almost a month, and now I just have a few beers here or there (with the exception of last night lol). I wanted to give myself time to get used to not smoking, so when I did drink it wouldn’t really be a thought to step out for a smoke, and it seems to have worked! Just wanted to share in case this might help anyone else :)

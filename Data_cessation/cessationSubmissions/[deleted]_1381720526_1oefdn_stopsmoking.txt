I had one...

I had one cigarette...

I had a bad dream, really bad. I heard that it was common after quitting, but I underestimated just how real and vivid the dreams really would be. It was terrible. I woke up and was shaking, I was so upset. I was tired and overwhelmed, and I caved and had one.

It tasted awful and smelt even worse, but at the time I didn't care. I thought it would help--and sure, it calmed me down for a moment, but I think that was just the comfort of the familiarity. After I put it out I immediately regretted it and refused to have another and went back inside.

I wish I never had, because I feel like I am back at square one. I came so far... it seems silly, especially seeing all these other people with hundreds of days, and I feel so happy just having a week under my belt...

I really don't want to remove my tag... I don't want my whole week to be for nothing just for one lousy cigarette. But if you guys think I should remove it, I will. It seems weak to want to hold onto it so bad, but I don't want to see that number one next to my name again.

I don't know why I am writing this, even. Just wanted to get it off my chest.

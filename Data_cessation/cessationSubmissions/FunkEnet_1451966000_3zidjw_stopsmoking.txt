Happy quitting folks!

I read Alan Carr's book over 3 year ago and its one of the best things I ever did for myself. From there I decided to lose weight and get into shape. Now I am 60 pounds lighter, can run a half marathon, and am hoping to run a marathon in the next year and hopefully a triathlon soon after that. 

If I never made that decision years ago to get tobacco out of my life I would never be at the level of fitness I am at today and wouldn't even dream of the goals that I now wish to achieve. I wish you all the very best, if you succeed you won't regret it.

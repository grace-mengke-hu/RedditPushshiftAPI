Any tips for the panic?

I have a fairly intense history of anxiety attacks and, although I have the gum which helps, I can't help but feel very nervous. The fog reminds me of dissociation and I swear I heard something like a walkie talkie in my ear earlier, despite the fact that there was nothing.

I'm at least aware this is anxiety and can practice some grounding techniques, but does anyone have any tips or is this just something I have to sit through for a few days?

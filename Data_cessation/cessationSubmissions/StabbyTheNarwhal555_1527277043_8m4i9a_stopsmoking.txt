What is the best way I can support my best friend quitting?

Hey y'all!  My best friend is fixing to quit smoking. He's smoked for over 30 years and currently smokes two packs a day. I wanted to ask y'all how can I support him and help him succeed? I want to help him the best way that I can. I do not smoke, so I do not have very much insight on this. Any advice is greatly appreciated!

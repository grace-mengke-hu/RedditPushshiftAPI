26 days in but feeling worse than ever

So as a little background I had been smoking ~15 a day for the last 6 years and decided to quit seeing as my gap year after university was coming to an end and I wanted to start my professional career smoke free.

The initial 3 weeks were somewhat breezy, obviously I had a few serious moments of thinking this isn't worth the hassle. However, on the whole I managed very well up to last weekend. 

Whilst I was away during my gap year the family moved home and therefore many of my craving routine remained in the old house which I think made it much easier. Until last weekend when I went back to Manchester to visit university friends, this is where many of the cravings came back in full force. Since I was going back to the pubs and houses I spent a lot of time at drinking and smoking it was really difficult and I had to leave early on one occasion because I just wasn't enjoying myself.

Now I am back in my home away from all of those triggers I thought I would be feeling better however I can't say I've felt more like smoking since the first few hours after quitting, I'm feeling very down a bit lost. 

Is this normal? How long do these sorts of cravings last? seeing as the last bit of nicotine is far gone from my body it must just be psychological but I was wondering if anyone has had similar experiences in the past? At the moment I am feeling strong enough not to give in purely for the fact I've done almost a month and feel it would've been all wasted if I started again but I'm definitely feeling more closer giving in than ever before.

It's my first post on here so I'm sorry if I've made any mistake, I'll be happy to amend any mistakes. 

Thank you, 

Morgan

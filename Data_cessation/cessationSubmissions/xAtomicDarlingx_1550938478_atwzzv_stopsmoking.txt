4 Months and Not Quite Safe Yet

Next week will mark 4 months having quit smoking after 16 years and two failed attempts. I’ve been having a lot of smoking dreams over the last couple of weeks which goes to show how deeply that addiction has buried itself in my brain. 

I used Allen Carr’s Easy Way (for Women) and mostly I do find it easy. Like most people will tell you, the first month is the hardest but it gets better from there. For me, it got better and better, then drastically worse in the form an ocean of depression so deep that I just couldn't get my head back above water for two weeks. I’m finally back up and treading water.

But I’m smoking in my dreams.

One week

One week since my last cigarette. I made it through a tough night shift tonight with some Vape and nicotine gum 👍🏻 got a wedding at the weekend which will be difficult however I’m sticking to it! 

My brother had a heart attack a few weeks ago. Early 40’s. Fit, healthy and doesn’t smoke. Scared me enough to actually stop and stick to it this time! The hardest thing is to break routines I’ve found. 

Next mile stone - 2 weeks. Here we go....

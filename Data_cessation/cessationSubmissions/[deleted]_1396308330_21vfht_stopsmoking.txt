need some advice

I'm not a heavy smoker(5-6 a day) but I'm looking to kick the habit. However the last time this happened I ended up sleeping 11 hours a day and being tired all the time. I took the habit back up because I am much too busy to be operating at anything below 100%. So is there anyone who has had this experience who has a good way to fight this?

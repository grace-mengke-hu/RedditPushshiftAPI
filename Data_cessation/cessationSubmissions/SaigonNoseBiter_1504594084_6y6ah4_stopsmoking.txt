I had a planned cold turkey quit of not only tobacco, but also weed, alcohol, and adderall. Day 5!

This probably wasn't the best way to do things (4 substances cold turkey), but it was the only way I could do it.  Day 1&amp;2 were kind of easy because I was so jacked to quit because of how I motivated myself.  I just slept or ate any time things got rough, and just ignored any bad thoughts, as I knew my mind would be playing tricks on me for a bit.  I didn't even give them the time of day, where before I would get into a mental debate.  I have very large motivating factors, but I didn't have a 'rock bottom' event.  I fear that this fact may be a problem in the future to stay on the wagon.  In any case, day 3 and 4 were FUCKING BRUTAL!  Insane anxiety and overall uncomfortable feelings, and even a bit physically sick.  I just couldn't chill out and be at peace.  I went to a friends' house for a while who offered me weed and booze 4 times 'by accident' just out of honest mistakes of being nice.  Had to leave there.  Day 4 I went to a bbq with about 15 people boozing and smoking hard.  That was a close one, but I feel I need to remain involved in those events so as to not feel like I'm missing out on life just because I want to be sober.  Eventually someone who lives there showed up later on who is also on the wagon, and that helped tremendously.  I got into a huge argument with my best friend over the board game Risk (I tried warning him that would happen).  But in the end it was a good night and I stayed strong.  Now it's day 5, and I feel like I'm finally over the fucking hump!

Weed and tobacco are closely linked in my addictions because I smoke spliffs.  I could always quit one or the other, but not both.  I feel like making past day 4 is a huge milestone for me.  

Just wanted to tell someone how proud I am :-)  Cheers!

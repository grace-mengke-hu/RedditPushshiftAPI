Sensitivity in the work place?

Quitting has left me a bit depressed lately and my sleep just sucks. Came in late today and tried to explain my situation, not expecting to be excused of my tardiness, just understood what quitting has done to me mentally.
My supervisor then says, "well I didn't force you to quit. It's not my fault you decided to smoke in the first place." Etc somewhere along the lines with that. I just thought that was a shitty comment to be made. Sure, my attitude hasn't been the greatest, but my supervisor is making it seem like quitting isn't that big of a deal and I should "leave my problems at home."

I hate using quitting as an excuse for my behavior... But it's a major factor at the moment.

How do you deal with the mood swings and the tears and lack of sleep?

Quick question can second hand smoking trigger withdrawals if you have recently quit smoking

I was at an enclosed place yesterday where a lot of people were smoking. I didn’t take a single puff but my shirt ended up smelling like cigarettes that’s how bad it was. Next day I started to feel nauseous again... could it be because of the second hand smoke? Has anyone else experienced something like this?

Went drinking without smoking!

A few friends called me out for a quick midweek beer yesterday, they're all smokers. I smoke like a chimney when drinking, and was scared of going yesterday for fear of lighting one up (decided to quit sunday afternoon, haven't had one since). I don't know how, but I managed to get through it without having a single drag! I feel great! My gf is out of town, and she's a smoker as well, I guess that'll be the next test. Here's hoping I get past that too!

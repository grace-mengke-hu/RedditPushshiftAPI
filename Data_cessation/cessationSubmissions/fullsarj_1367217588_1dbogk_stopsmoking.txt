Hard to quite as I'm in Saudi Arabia

Here's the situation - I never smoked that much in the States, but since I've come abroad, the boredom, and lack of any other way to "relax" has me smoking over a pack a day. I tried to limit myself to just a couple, but found I'd already conditioned myself to do everything with a cigarette in hand. I'd like to take a break of a week or two, then allow myself to have a pack around for the occasional social cigarette - as it really is the only "vice" or recreational chemical available here. What do you think? I'd appreciate any motivatin, support, or tips.

Decided to quit smoking. Joined Reddit because I saw this sub.

I decided to join Reddit after lurking this sub for a bit. I'm 27, been smoking a pack to a pack and a half a day for about 6 years. Tried to quit several times in the past and never made it past a few days.

I've recently used SmokeFree with mild success, but in the past I've found myself ignoring the timer or just pressing it anyway.

My fianc√©e and our two boys recently got an apartment together and I'm renewed in my want to quit, but the stress of the move has me smoking more than I had been. 

Now that things have settled down, I'm still stressed, but I've started SmokeFree again and am doing my best to stick with it. I've considered going cold turkey, but I have a bit of a temper already and am afraid of how I might act.

Last night, I noticed I don't like the way I feel after having a smoke. About halfway through it (I smoke 100s), I start feeling... "off". My muscles feel a little achey, my neck feels tense, and I get a slight headache. This alone has pushed me to quit, but at the same time I'm scared of the withdrawls.

So I come here, my first post on Reddit, asking for help. Advice on how to go about this. What I'll face, how to cope, etc. I enjoy smoking, but it's terrible for me, makes me feel bad, and is a hemorrhage on my money.

Any advice would be appreciated.

P.S. I'm not too keen on trying a vape, I'm worried that will end up as another habit I'll need to kick.

TLDR: Pack a day smoker for 6 years, looking for tips, advice, etc. to help quit and deal with withdrawals.

I'm over a month at this point and...

Feeling really good about it. It was difficult at first, but I'm not fighting the mental "I want to smoke" so much anymore. Its happening about 3-4 times a week instead of 7-8 times a day. I am also very happy to report I have used my no nicotine vape very sparingly. At a bonfire, at the bar, at a night drinking with some friends at my house. I do not reach to it like a crutch except in situations where temptation and access to a cigarette is easy.
My irritability has gone down, stress has gone down, I don't smell bad all the time, my teeth are whiter, I don't have to stand out in the rain to smoke, and I don't have to make extra stops anymore to buy cigarettes. LIFE IS GOOD.

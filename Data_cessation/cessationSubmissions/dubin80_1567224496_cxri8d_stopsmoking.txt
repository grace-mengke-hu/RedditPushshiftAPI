Transitioning to Step 2 of the patch

Beware that the cravings will intensify a bit once you transition to step 2 of the patch. But they aren’t as intense as when you first quit because by the time you get to step 2, you’ve almost completely kicked the psychological habit (at least I almost have). 
So be ready for it and stay strong!!!!

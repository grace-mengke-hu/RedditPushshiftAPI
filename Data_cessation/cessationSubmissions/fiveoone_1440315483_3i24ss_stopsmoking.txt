Stop smoking on holiday, what to do when you get back to normal life?

Hi everyone, first post here. 
I've decided that I will never smoke tobacco again. I've been smoking for 7 years and smoke about 10 a day. Now I'm on my 3rd day and even though I still trigger withdrawals (after food, after coffee, after wine, getting a bit stressed, before bed, after bed..) I can manage them easily here because I physically can't buy any cigarettes.

Things are going great.

But what will happen when I get home? Most of my friends smoke while drinking but not really otherwise. They seem to manage this without any problem but I know it's not something for me. I'm sure  as soon as I open the door I'll have a bunch of triggers waiting for me to just have one. I'm not gonna start again. 

Do you have any tips for me reddit? How can I get rid of my stupid thoughts about going home?

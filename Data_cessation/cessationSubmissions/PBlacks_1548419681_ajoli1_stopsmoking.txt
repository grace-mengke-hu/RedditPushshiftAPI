Has anyone here who's finished a full patch regime had w/d symptoms?

I have really severe w/d symptoms, including the quitter's flu turning into a lupus flare-up, severe mental health problems (worsening anxiety, depression, mood instability, PTSD), and akathisia. 

I'm currently on week three of using nicotine patches, so I can taper off nicotine more gently. I'm doing it by the book (on 14mg for 6 weeks, then going to do 7mg for 2 weeks and quit) and it's working wonderfully so far (just some mild depression, fatigue, and anxiety) but I wanted to know if anyone has had serious w/d when going off the last step, the 7mg patches, after doing it the recommended way. I want to know what to prepare for.

If only I had found reddit sooner... :)

I'm new to this site and I keep finding subreddits I can really relate to. I've been smoking a pack a day to a pack and a half a day for 4 years now and I've tried to quit 3 times. The last time I tried I went to a doctor with my mother actually and we both got "zapped". A lot of people said it worked for them but sadly it didn't for my mom and I. That was last summer. I feel like if I had found reddit then I could've had a better chance of quitting and living through the cramps and aggravation. I believe the next time I quit it will be for good. If I had found reddit sooner I also might have kicked my oxy habit sooner than I did. If I had found reddit sooner I would have realized that I have a fapping problem too. Anyway, i'm glad i know of its existence now and am open to talking to anyone. :)

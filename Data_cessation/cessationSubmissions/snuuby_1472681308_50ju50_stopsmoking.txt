Tips on staying smoke free at parties?

So im going to this party on friday, and so far i've been smoke free for about 5 days (badge is wrong). Its been pretty tough so far, and i fear for the party. It's outdoors, a lot of people smoke and i will be drinking, so that kind of scares me. Do you guys have any tips on how to avoid smoking on such occasions?

Thanks :-)

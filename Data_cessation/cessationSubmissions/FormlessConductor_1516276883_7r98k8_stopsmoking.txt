Start counting from today

I've been a smoker since 2002, and I was smoking at least 1 pack per day, some times 2 or even 3 when things get stressful.
Quit for 3 times before, 8 months, 8 months, and 1 and half months.

After been struggling for a while, I've finally came to the point to make this commitment, that I will never smoke cigarettes again.

I will keep updating this post until I lost count, and hopefully I can get some mental support from you guys.

Briefly, for most cases, it's a habitual behavior where our brain tells us to do the things we used to. So I will just keep bending my mind until it get used to this new life without cigarettes.

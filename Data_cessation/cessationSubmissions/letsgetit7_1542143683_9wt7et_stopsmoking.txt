Finally made the decision, Any advice?

I'm relatively young (mid 20s) and have been smoking for about 6 years now. In the start it was just one or cigarettes here and there (like it is for most of us). Recently, however, I had become pretty dependant on it. I used to think that I'm not addicted but I recently decided that admitting it was the first stop to actually quitting.   


This is my first post on here, and I decided to post after having not smoked for 7 days. Which I did successfully. However, I smoked 1 today since I was with a friend to whom I did not want to explain the whole charade of quiting to him (yes, he is not a great influence).  


Any advice on how to get through cravings better?  


Thanks in advance!

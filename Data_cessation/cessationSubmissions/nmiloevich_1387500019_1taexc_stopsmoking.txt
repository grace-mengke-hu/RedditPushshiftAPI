11 year smoker - trying to quit after going to Emerg this week at age 23.

I started smoking when I was 12, and have been smoking steadily ever since. To make matters worse, I was diagnosed with asthma around the same time. As it goes for most smokers/asthmatics, I got a cold a few weeks ago and my asthma flared up. Normally when I get sick, I quit smoking for a few days/to a week to try and not get any lung infections (I have had pneumonia multiple times). This time I was cutting back but still smoking, I just had to have another smoke! Long story short, I went to the doctor got put on serious steroids. Still woke up in the middle of the night every night struggling to breathe. This tuesday I was sitting in bed thinking, that's it, I can't take another breath, its too hard, my muscles can't do it. I went to emerg, got a nebulizer, and more steroids. I am 23 years old, and my lungs are giving up. I haven't had a smoke in 3 days now - but I also haven't left my bed. I Find my cravings always get worse after a week or two, or after a drinks. It doesn't help that my partner smokes - that realllllly is pissing me off. So...end rant, but if you are so kind - would love tips on how deal with not smoking when you have a partner that smokes, and how not to smoke when you have a drink! I need to do this for my health!

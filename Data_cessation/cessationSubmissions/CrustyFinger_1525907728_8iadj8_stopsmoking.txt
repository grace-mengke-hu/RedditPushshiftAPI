First Cigarette in 5 months

It happened this Monday as I was coming out from a concert, still buzzing I thought there would be no better way to end the night than with a cigarette so I asked the nearest smoker for a roll. I smoked about half of it before I stubbed it out because I felt sick, i think the idea of it was a lot more enjoyable than actually doing it. 

The fact that It made me feel I'll isn't really the point of this post, although I am a little surprised my body rejected it. My point is that although my streak was broken, a lapse doesn't have to be a relapse. Previous attempts have had the first cigarette always be a domino, with the that mentality as soon as I break I've failed. That's a load of bs, lapsing doesn't negate all the progress you've made, it doesn't make you a failure and there is no reason for it to stop you from quitting. 

Huge shout out to this awesome subreddit btw, the solidarity, the success stories, the boundless encouragement every single one of you gives. It's really cool. 

Well wishes to everyone readiing this, whatever stage in this journey you're at. You can do it!

I almost gave in, almost. DAY 1.

Day 1 went well.  I was going strong today at work, staying the course, keeping my mind occupied when a craving came, it's when I got home that things became worse.  Suddenly I had no work to keep me occupied and before I knew it, I found myself on the couch staring at my girlfriends pack on the coffee table in front of me. Looking mighty friendly I might add. I thought to myself, "one more wouldn't hurt, I've done great all day, reward yourself" it was tempting but then I realized that this wasn't me talking, it was my trusty old friend Mr Nic, we'd been through a lot, my divorce, my car accident, my bout with homelessness but despite all this I came to the conclusion that I had to bid adieu to good old Nic and find some better, healthier friends. I didn't give in, I really wanted to but I recognized a pattern from why my previous attempts failed and did something a little different this time.  

Hopefully I keep recognizing that this isn't me anymore.  I'm on Day 2 now and if today is like yesterday I think I'll be okay.

Views on eCigarettes?

Hello all, I hope this is the right place to post this!

So I've finally decided to quit smoking again... and this time, I've been 2 days successful with the help of eCigs.

But I was wondering... is quitting smoking with the help of eCigs the same thing as drinking an non-alcoholic beer for an alcoholic? Many alcoholics say no way to NAs because it's a slippery slope for us once we start drinking non-alcoholic beer because somehow it convinces us that we can have REAL beer again one day. Which, for the most part, isn't true. 

I guess my question is, are eCigs = NA Beer in terms of quitting my smoking habit?

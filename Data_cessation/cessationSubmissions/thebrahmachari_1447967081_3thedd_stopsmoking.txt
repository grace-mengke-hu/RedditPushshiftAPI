How long does it take for cigs to damage your health?

I've smoked 6 cigs in my entire life. I am only going to continue smoking until I lose about 20-30 lbs, over a max 6 month period. I would exercise but I can't really get to a gym or get out in the neighborhood I live in, so I'm just smoking and not eating. If I quit immediately afterward, will I have really done any damage?

Suggestions to quit vaping?

I started vaping to quit smoking. A little bit of a background, I was an occasional smoker (smoked only with friends and while drinking) 

My motivations to quit smoking were

* The after smell - I used to hate how my lips, finger and clothes smelled after I smoked
* Wanted to smoke in places I couldn't - Since I always chose to keep my house smoke free, I could never "enjoy" my cigarette. I used to feel the urge to smoke while having my morning cup of coffee and watching the news, while having a drink or while reading a book on the couch
* It kills you - I like to live a healthy life and couldn't bear the feeling that I was killing myself after every cigarette I smoked


Since I started vaping I could pretty much do all of the above (except the killing part which might be debatable). The great thing was that I could also vape in bars/indoors. As long as you don't rip clouds, no one really cared. I used to discretely vape my juul. Hell, I would even go to the bathroom and vape at work, get my nicotine kick and not have to worry about stepping out in brutal cold or my clothes smelling.

My motivation to quit is that I am now vaping constantly. I definitely get withdrawals when I havent vaped. Also, because I only vape closed tank systems (i.e. you dont need to fill in e-liquid, change the tank/atomizer blah blah) it gets expensive pretty quick. 

Has anyone successfully quit vaping and can share their thoughts/experiences? Would really appreciate it.

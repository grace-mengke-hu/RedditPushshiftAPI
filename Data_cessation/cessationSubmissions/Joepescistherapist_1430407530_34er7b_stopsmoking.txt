I cracked

Yesterday I knowingly went to my cousins house knowing their entire family smokes and that their house is always filled with smoke. I broke down after a week and to be honest I feel alittle guilty, but at the same time I'm proud because I'm not craving it anymore. I put it in my head to stick to working out and getting healthy and it's working out great. Who else is working out like a monster to get over smoking?

Quitting, what about Tobacco/weed mix?

So i'm gonna go at my first attempt to quit for real. Been smoking about 5-15 cigarettes a day for 3 years and never really tried to quit. Thing is i don't have any desire to stop smoking weed, i do this like once a week mixed with cigarettes cause of money. Will this completely fuck up my cig quitting? I mean will it just make me relapse when i get the little nicotine through the joint? Also, how good is nicotine gum really? I feel like i'm mostly addicted to the routine of going outside and de-stressing with a cigarette but that's probably the nicotine tricking me :p

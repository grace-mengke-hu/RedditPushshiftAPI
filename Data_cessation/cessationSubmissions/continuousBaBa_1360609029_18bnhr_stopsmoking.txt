Made it the first 7 days

I started when I was 15 years old and I turn 35 this week. The last day I had a cigarrette was last Saturday 2/2. Since then I have been around it many times and have not cheated. I am pretty comfortable.

I've tried to quit in the past and it was always a nightmare. I don't know exactly what is different this time. I have two kids who I love and they hate that I smoke. It has been making me feel like death lately when I smoke socially while drinking with friends. I think my body just changed, and I realized this was my crossroads. I can either quit and maintain my current health level, or I could continue and start rolling the dice with all of the health problems smoking brings. I'm pretty happy so far to be quitting. I use an app on my phone that reminds me of how long it's been, how much $ I've saved, etc and I find that helpful too.

1 Month 8 Days In... the cough from hell!

Hi guys

Feeling great from my quit, been using a vape with 6mg of nicotine very occasionally to help me on nights out down the pub once a week. Working on cutting this out completely now and being nicotine free. No desire to smoke a cigarette ever again. 

But my lord above, the cough I have. It’s terrible, it comes in waves but is worse early morning and after eating. Getting rid of a lot of tar so I’m not too worried,but Jesus I want it to stop, it’s so irritating. 

So, anyone else have any experience for how long it took for their cough to improve? I need a little bit of reassurance that there’s some light at the end of the tunnel.

For reference I’m 23 and smoked near a pack a day for 3 years. But had been smoking on and off for 7 years.

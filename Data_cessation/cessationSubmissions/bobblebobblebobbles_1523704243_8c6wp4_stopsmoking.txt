Change the Habit of Smoking

Hi friends,
I'm on day 6 of a decade long daily one or two cigarettes. I've quit before and have thrown out many packs after only 1 or 2 were smoked but I've always eventually lit up again and because I could quit for long stretches of time, I tried to believe I wasn't actually addicted for the longest time.
Since finding this thread and seeing the amazing app y'all are using, I downloaded it too. Wow... Logging those cravings is EYE OPENING. My cravings aren't strong but I have basically no self control so as soon as the thought of a smoke has popped into my head before, I would indulge. I became a very well trained dog.

The duhigg book on the power of habit has me doing a few things that I think are helping me. It's an interesting book that explains how habits are formed, how powerful they are and how to change them. Long story short, we respond to triggers with behaviors and then the behaviors are rewarded. 

So for example, I am arriving home, where my cigarettes are. In the past, I've usually always smoked at home. So like Pavlov's dogs, now, whenever I'm getting near home, the thought of having a cigarette pops into my head. The reward to smoking is that relaxed feeling. 

The way to CHANGE our behavior is to make plans for engaging in DIFFERENT behavior when we experience those se triggers. The new behaviors also should lead to some positive reinforcement. For example, I log the craving in the smoking app and then am rewarded by seeing the app's feedback or how my health is improving the longer I go without smoking. I also take 10 short deep breaths really fast because that gives me a similar feeling of being relaxed immediately, similar to after I've taken a drag.

I hope this helps someone else...we can do it!

A question about high pressure situations

I recently decided to quit again, and was feeling good about it. However, two days in, I found myself in a situation where I was at the pub with two strangers who were both smoking. This, along with the mild social anxiety which comes with hanging out with people you don't know, led to me smoking as well.

My question is: is it better to keep yourself away from these high pressure situations and face them a bit later on when you've quit for a while? Will it be easier to go to the pub later on and resist the temptation to smoke?

No Bronchitis for Me This Year

I've been smoking 1-3 packs a day for 8 years. I've tried to quit more times than I can count, my longest 'quit' lasting almost a year. 

But this time is different. I've had a slight cough for the last few weeks and keep thinking how it's going to ramp up into this years bronchitis, hoping it wouldn't turn into pneumonia again. I'm sick of waiting to get sick, expecting it every year, month after month. Smoking is what is making me sick, only lung related infections while I keep up a healthy level of exercise (and then some) and eat like a champ. 

Why would I keep choosing to life healthy in every aspect of my life except the most important one? Why do I not run (though I love to) because of the fear of the pain in my chest when I do? Why do I put up with the smell, the loss of energy, the nausea, the anxiety, the awful lung capacity, the infections, the fear?

Yeah, no answer. I'm fucking done.

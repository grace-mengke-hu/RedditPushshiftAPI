What ideas do you have or what do you actually use as cigarette "substitutes?"

I need a badge reset because my current one is a lie :( I put this shit off way too long and would like to get this silly habit out of the way -- I used to use gum but while practical in some ways, I'd like to have options in what I use to substitute for cigarettes in times where I would generally go have a smoke? Any ideas or input?

THANKS!

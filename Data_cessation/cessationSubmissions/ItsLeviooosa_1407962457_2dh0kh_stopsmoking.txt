First trip to town.

Today I have to go to town (we live in the country) by myself for the first time since I quit. I used nicotine replacements a little for the first 5 days then yesterday was the first day with no nicotine whatsoever. All I have to do is drive (!) to town, go past all the shops, buy the shit I need, and go home. So many shops! I'm going to bring the nicotine spray with me in case I get really bad cravings but I won't use it unless I'm really tempted to buy smokes. Wish me luck!

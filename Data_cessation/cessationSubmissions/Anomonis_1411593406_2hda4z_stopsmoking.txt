My latest attempt to quit

Hello /r/stopsmoking.
I have tried numerous times to quit this year, about 8 times.  I used an ecig for awhile, but it didn't allow me to quit.  I've also read Allan Carr's Easyway book, which didn't help me quit though I did get some good lessons from it about frame of mind.

Now, today, I've destroyed/thrown out all my smoking implements and am making a big push to quit. I have quite a bit going on in my life with school and all, but I really feel a strong need to get this done.

If anyone has any advice for a 29m 13 year smoker trying to quit again, please share, and thank you all!

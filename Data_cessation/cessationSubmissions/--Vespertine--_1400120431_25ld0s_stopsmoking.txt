Those of you who had acne or other skin issues-- did any of you see any changes when trying to quit/after quitting?

I've been smoking for about 6 years and have horrible acne. Nothing I have ever tried has worked-- and I've tried nearly every medication, I've been on birth control, I've tried natural methods, exercise, etc... 

Just wondering if any of you who struggled with acne noticed any difference in your skin after you quit smoking. I know that smoking generally can lead to skin dehydration and the like, but I'm curious to hear what others have experienced with skin changes at all.

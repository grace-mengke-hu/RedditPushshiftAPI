Advice please anyone?

So I'm on day 17 of my no smoking journey, everything has been fine up until now. So me and my partner have been staying at my dads (a no smoking zone) until this evening when we returned to my house, until I gave up we used to both smoke in the house, only thing is now I've quit and he still keeps lighting up in the house. I understand he probably doesn't feel the need to ask as it was fine before, but tonight this has really bothered me. How do I bring up that this isn't what I want and it's not ok anymore without him getting defensive and thinking I've changed my tune because I've quit? Any advice here welcome please..

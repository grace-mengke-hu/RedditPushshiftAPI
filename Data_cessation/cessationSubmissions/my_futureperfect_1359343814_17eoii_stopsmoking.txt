A Month in the Making

For the last month I have been trying to quit smoking, but for some reason I couldn't get the ball rolling.  And then, yesterday morning I woke up feel horrible.  I was in a better mood and felt physically ill.  These coupled with the terrible feeling I got for smoking made me think, I am done.  Later, at work I told my co-worker that I had had enough.  I quit!  It has been almost 48 hours and I feel great.

This is not a slip, is a full on relapse

Got mega stressed last night. Huge drama and bla bla bla. 

Anyway, I was weak and failed! Horribly. This morning I couldn't stop smoking, I've been smoking the whole day. I think if there's anything worse than withdrawal, is the dissapointment of failing, today was my one month quit free, WAS. 

I'm going on vacation tomorrow and I don't know whether to carry on smoking during my holiday and quit again when I return, hopefully more refresh and relaxed, or try to quit again tomorrow. But I dont know if I'll be too weak to resist at the beach, I haven't taken a vacation in two years.

I'm afraid, I'm afraid I won't be able to stop smoking, like those relapse when suddenly cigarretes because your master and you can't seem to say no. That's how I feel at the moment. 

My willpower just feels so weak right now. 

Any advice would be helpfull

Dry mouth and excess mucus - how long before it goes away?

The most annoying side-effects to smoking were always the permanent dry mouth, irritated throat and mucus production I had.  

How long after quitting have those of you with the same side-effects noticed that they went away?  I'm on day 6 but still wake up with the same dry/irritated throat as when I was smoking, and I'm still horking up white mucus (whether from my sinuses or from my throat or lungs I don't know).

What's strange is that I know heavy smokers who say they don't feel discomfort, but I smoked half a pack of lights on work days and 3-4 cigarettes on days off and always felt that way pretty much since I started smoking 7 years ago.

Can I expect these things to go away relatively soon, or does it take a good year for the necessary parts to rebuild themselves first?

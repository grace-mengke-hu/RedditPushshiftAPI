Nearly 6 months nicotine free!

I just want to motivate anyone that is in their early days with quitting smoking. It is so hard! I found 3 weeks the worst, I was just pacing my house and it was touch and go for days. 

I will be 6 months free from smoking at the end of March and it has been so worth it. I still can't believe that after 22 years of smoking I am now a non-smoker. 

If you are in the early days, just focus on not smoking just for that moment... these moments add up and before you know it you will have made months without smoking.

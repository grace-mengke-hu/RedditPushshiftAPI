Did you have a lot of “I’ll quit really soon”s when you first started?

Aggghhh I don’t know why I started this. I’ve had problems with weed and alcohol but tobacco is a whole different beast. My dad smoked for 1 year, used chew for 10, and has now used nicotine gum for 20; he runs marathons so he’s kind of a paradox. My brother has chewed for 7 years, he recently quit but only lasted like 10 days and started again. I don’t know if it runs in the family or if that’s just a coincidence, or if I have a penchant for addiction.

I started mixing it with weed bowls 3 months ago (I quit weed 2 mo.’s ago) and then a month ago I bought my own first pack. It lasted a couple days, I quit for 5 days and bought another, so on and so forth. I’ve thrown a few of them away with half left because I know I shouldn’t keep it up. So back to my title, were you like this? Did you keep saying “I’ll just do this for now but quit soon?” I don’t want to deepen my psychological connection to it obviously and should quit before I really get my neurological pathways Pavlov’d into it. It’s been a couple days now and I’m sober from weed/alcohol. Potato chips help me fix the oral fixation a little bit. I guess I’m just bored and single, haven’t dated for a long time, so it’s like I’m looking for respite from the loneliness in disregard of my health. I walk and lift a lot but I’m too tired to exercise for dopamine all the time. 

Sorry for the rant, I guess I’m just avoiding buying any by writing this.

Going on 3 weeks non smoker. Food tastes SO good!

Itâ€™s like Iâ€™m learning flavors all over again. Fruit, juicy and sweet. Lemonade is amazing. I no longer have to dump salt on food. I can totally get why some people gain some weight. Everything tastes so good now. Donâ€™t even get me started on a nice cup of coffee. Mmm!!

That alone will keep me a non smoker for the rest of my life.  

Merry Christmas everyone ðŸŽ„

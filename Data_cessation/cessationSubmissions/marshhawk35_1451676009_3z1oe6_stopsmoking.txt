Day 19 - and a smoke free New Year's Eve!

Just popping in to say HOLY SHIT I made it through New Year's Eve without smoking (and I was out partying till late, too). New Year's Eve was apparently some sort of trigger milestone because I craved all day yesterday. Today, I feel like a huge weight has been lifted from me. 

To all the new ex-smokers today, you CAN do this. Like many have said, read Alan Carr's Easyway Book and Joel Spitzer's books on whyquit.com. I found the combination of both books was what I needed - they take slightly different approaches towards the same thing. And come to this sub often. Reading stories from others is really inspiring when you feel stuck.

Next stop, one month!

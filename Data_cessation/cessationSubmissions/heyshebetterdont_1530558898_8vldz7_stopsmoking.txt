How can I help my husband?

I am a non-smoker and my husband is quitting after 20+ years....he has to for a surgery coming up, but he has also wished he could for a very long time. today is his first day and understandably, it sucks for him. I want to do everything in my power to be supportive but not annoying. Does anyone have any advice? Thx in advance!

attempt # 5?

To anyone who have successfully quit smoking.. Advice pls?

I seem to have inadvertently quit recently coz I've been really sick, and felt so gross after having a cigarette. It's hard.to continue smoking when you've got sinusitis and bronchitis.

I'd like to take this as an opportunity to quit, but here's the thing. The last time I tried to quit I had an extremely short fuse and got angry really quickly (mostly with family). 

Smoking is my go to when I'm pissed off or upset or stressed. So as soon as I get pisses off or upset (which happens a lot coz I live with my mother and she does my head in) the first thing I want to do is have a smoke. Any suggestions on how to deal, without feeling like I'm gonna murder someone?

I cracked, and let me tell you how scary it was.

I was smoke free for a solid two months, the last month without cravings. One night I was drinking with friends, and in my drunken stupor, I took a few drags. The next morning I bummed a few cigarettes. The next day I bought a pack.

The path to being smoke free is long, difficult, and painfully memorable. The path to going back to smoking is less of a path and more of a fall; you don't remember the blurry seconds as you were falling, and you feel almost as if it were completely out of control. Yet you sit in pain wishing it never happened. 

Let this be a warning to everyone who quit and is still going strong. Watch where you step or you might fall. It happens so quick and easy, it's scary.

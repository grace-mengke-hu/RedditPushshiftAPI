Started Smoking Again After Quitting for 9.5 Years

Hey all, wanted to share my story to emphasize how important it is to stay vigilant.  Up until about six weeks ago I hadn't had a cigarette since November 10, 2007.  At the beginning of 2017 I decided to give up drinking.  I've been really stressed at school this entire semester, and one day in early March I just said, 'Fuck it. I'm not drinking anymore, I can afford to have a smoke.' Well, I think everyone probably knows where this is headed.  Moderation did not work for me, and after almost a decade COMPLETELY smoke free I feel like I'm starting all over again. Cravings are as strong as I remember when I quit before. The point of my story is to stay vigilant. If you're anything like me having just a single cigarette can derail your commitment to quit. At least that's how it was for me.

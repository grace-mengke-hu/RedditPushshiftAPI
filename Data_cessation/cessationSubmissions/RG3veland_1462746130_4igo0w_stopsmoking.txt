Does anyone else have anxiety? I'm 90 days in.

Today is actually day 90. I've saved tons of money. I breathe better. I feel great when people at work are fiending for a cigarette and I feel fine. But man, this anxiety has not stopped.

I swear it wasn't like this when I was smoking. I'm the most stable I've ever been in my life financially, I'm single, I'm debt free for the first time in years. My life is great! But I always have this feeling of... impending doom? Or these feelings of "oh god why did I do that" and blah blah blah. I'm anxious as hell. Any time I'm alone. I shrugged it off at first but man, it's been 3 months. I can't keep feeling like this.

Anyone else experience anxiety or depression that stuck around?

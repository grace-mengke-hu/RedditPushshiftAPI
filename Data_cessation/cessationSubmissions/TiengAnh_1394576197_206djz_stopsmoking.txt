What unexpected benefits have you gotten from stopping?

I have looked over the benefits of smoking cessation on whyquit.com - and they sound great. But in my case, I've already noticed some other good things happening. I used to get [shin splints](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shin_splints) when walking. It was so painful that sometimes I had to sit down on a park bench or something for a few minutes.

 Today I noticed that I wasn't getting any!
Since smoking seriously influences blood circulation, I figure stopping has something to do with it.

So I'm wondering, what surprising but good things have happened to you since you've stopped?

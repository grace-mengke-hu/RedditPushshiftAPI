I feel free...

I am writing because I feel I should thank everyone here. Really, people, just coming here and reading about other people's struggle helps a lot. I didn't think it would, but it feels so nice when you realise that you really are not the only one to experience this feeling! 
I have been a smoker for the past twenty years. I only quit once before, but it was forced and it was a fake as I secretly smoked one or two cigs every day. It's day nine today but it feels final. I don't ever want this filth to define who I am again. I don't even feel cravings any more. It's just the memory of the habit. 
But at times I'm overwhelmed by a feeling of sadness I can't explain nor fight. It's as if I actually lost something dear. Other times I get angry at others who seem entitled to do something that only I had to quit! 
I call these moments and these thoughts "Nikotine Talk" and I tweet something silly about them. I try to laugh at my stupid psychological addiction. Or I come here and read. And it just gets better. 
You see, we all started for a reason. Maybe not the one we say, but there was a reason. And we all believed we enjoyed it. And we're all afraid we're not going to make it. And we are all going to make it in the end. There's a day in our future when we will automatically say "I don't smoke" when we are asked and we'll mean it. 
My first post, sort of a confession! Sorry, and thanks everyone. Keep fighting the good fight.

New to vape.

Have been smoking since I was 16. (13 years) To think all the damage I've done has been slowly starting to give me anxiety as I get older. Every time I quit, I'm successful for a few months but then relapse. Finally decided to give the vape thing a try and so far it seems to be an interesting move. It's only day 2 but my lungs are feeling a little better. I keep getting urges to not really smoke, but do the things that accompany that habbit like going outside after I eat, rolling down my window when I drive, checking gas stations to see if they have my kind, but not really actually smoke since I'm still getting nicotine. Any advice from anyone successfully quitting will help. Or even vape advice. I have no idea what I'm doing but my entire life smells like peach slushy instead of stale tobacco smoke so I think that's  better lol. I just want to ride my motorcycle for the rest of my life since it keeps my mind off it haha.

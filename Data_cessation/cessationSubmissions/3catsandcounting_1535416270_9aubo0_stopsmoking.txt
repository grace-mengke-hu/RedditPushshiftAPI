Tomorrow is THE day

Hello everyone! Pack a day, sometimes two smoker on the eve of my appointment to get some help tackling my smoking. I’m nervous and excited as I’ve spent my entire adult life as a smoker. When I called to set up a doctors appointment I didn’t expect they would be able to get me in so soon, I made the appointment and began to try to talk myself out of it, I didn’t and I feel it’s the first hurdle I’ve overcome. I know there are going to be many more and that’s where the real fight begins. I’m hoping I can slip away from them as easy as I fell into them. Either way the posts I’ve been reading are encouraging and provide hope!

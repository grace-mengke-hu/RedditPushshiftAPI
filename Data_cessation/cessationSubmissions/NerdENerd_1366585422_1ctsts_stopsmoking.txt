Feel like I passed a milestone last night

I went out and got drunk last night. We were sitting inside when my friend suggested that we sit outside. I was a bit hesitant to go outside because that is where all the smokers were. I didn't have the slightest craving at all once I could smell the smoke. I feel like that is a milestone as most times I have failed is when drinking beer.

So close.

I'm at day 25. I'm so close to a month it's driving me crazy. My job has also been rather horrible. Just trying to take it day buy day. The majority of my craving is over . It is mostly when I get super stressed or mad. Still haven't drank any alcohol. I'm scared I will start again. I can do this though and keep telling myself I will not fail.

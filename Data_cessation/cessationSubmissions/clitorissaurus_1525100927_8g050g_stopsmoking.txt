It's time to respect myself

I have tried to quit before. I've been smoking for almost 10 years; sometimes less, sometimes more. Where I live, a lot of people smoke. My parents smoke, my co-workers smoke, most of my friends smoke. I smoked a pack a day for a long time, which equates to about 330$ per month. WOW. 

It's about time I respected myself, my body, and the environment. I want to prove to myself that I deserve better. That I can lead life healthily, and prove the haters wrong. I deserve my money, my time, my health. I want to be stronger. 

I need support and want to become implicated in this community.

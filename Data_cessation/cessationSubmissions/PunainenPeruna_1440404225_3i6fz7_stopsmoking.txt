Two weeks !

So end of today it will be 2 weeks of not smoking. 
I had a dream that I smoked one cigarette for no particular reason and when I woke up there was so much guilt . But I'm happy that I had that dream to kinda test myself how would it be if I smoked . 
There is times I don't think about it but now that I'm in the hospital that is kinda all I can think of but I don't want to smoke . 
And I'm feeling a lot better now so I can keep going strong :)

How are you doing non-smokers ?:)

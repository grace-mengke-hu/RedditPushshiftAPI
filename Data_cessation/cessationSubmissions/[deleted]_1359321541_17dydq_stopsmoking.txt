A week in and I must admit I cheated once

Everything was fantastic until yesterday, when one of my buddies came over and he is a very heavy smoker. First thing I noticed, WOAH THAT FUCKER STINKS! I could smell him from a mile away and had a moment of "Wow, I used to smell like that." But as the night progressed with him smoking and me puffing on my e-cig I tried a hit of one of his cigarettes. I know this is bad, but here's the miracle of it all, it tasted freaking horrible. I don't know how I used to think cigs tasted fantastic, but after just one hit all I could taste was ash.

I think I'm through the hard part now as (most) nicotine is out of my system and I can actually breath/workout again. It's a great feeling, here's to many more weeks like this!

My smile is amazing!

Its been 22 days since I had a cigarette and for a second today I really wanted one.

But, I've made a point to smile at everyone I spoke to today (which was quite a few people because I took my daughter to a festival).
I used my big teethy smile- the one that makes your eyes look happy and I am so proud of my progress. Smoking made me ashamed of smile. I love not feeling that way anymore

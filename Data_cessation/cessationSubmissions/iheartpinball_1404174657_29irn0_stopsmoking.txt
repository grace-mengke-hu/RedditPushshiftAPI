Day 1 almost complete...

22 hours and counting. I'm jonesing pretty hard, and using all the coping mechanisms I can think of. Eating, tv, checking my app, going outside, napping, redditing, chewing regular gum. I picked up some nicorette but am doing my best not to use it. Kept the receipt so hopefully can return in a month when I've kicked this thing. Encouragement welcome.

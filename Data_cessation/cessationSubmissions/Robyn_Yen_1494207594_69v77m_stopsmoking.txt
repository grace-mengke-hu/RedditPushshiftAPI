TWO WEEKS SMOKE FREE

Two weeks! That's a fortnight! That's 14 whole days! I am overwhelming pleased! Came off the patches, now just on the gum. Continuing to make myself proud every day! It's easier not to smoke, I know I'll be so disappointed if I do. I can sit in the middle of a group of smokers and feel nothing!

Situations I am worried about;
 Being drunk
 Panicking if I crave 
 Getting bored whilst driving

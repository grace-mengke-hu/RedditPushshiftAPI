3 weeks!!! (+when do i quit chewing gum??)

Three weeks ago on this day I had my last smokes. And I am SO happy I made the decision. The days up until now were so hard, I would never put myself through that again. The cravings I have now are very mild and very rare. I do feel moody at times, but I try not to blame it all on the cigarettes. That way I don't think I'll get happier if I smoke. I try to find the actual problem instead of just adding up my anxiety by smoking. It works. I don't think about smoking all the time anymore. I really feel good and look forward to just feeling better and being completely free, feeling happy about everyday life without it. And that doesn't feel hard anymore. Sometimes I think about smoking, of course, but it passes quicker and quicker every time. So. That's all great! 

The actual thing I wanna discuss is the fact that I still chew gum. Sometimes two days pass without it, some days I chew 1-5 of them. I hate the fact that I'm still on the nicotine. I don't like that I fall back on it, I want to be entirely off the addiction. Should I quit them entirely and just see if I can do it? Or is it too soon? I'm not so afraid of relapsing right now, but maybe that's naive? What do you say? How did you do it??

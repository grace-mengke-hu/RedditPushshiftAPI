3 Weeks ago, I had no idea I was smoking my last cigarette and had no intention of quitting. But, I am glad I escaped my addiction.

Today is week 3, and I feel great! I smoked for 8 years and had no intention of stopping any time soon. I got off work at 5:30 and sucked down a cigarette on my way to visit my sick grandmother.

For 8 years I hid my smoking from my family up until that day. My grandmother smelt the smoke on me as I arrived, and being an honest person I admitted to being a smoking. She was so disappointed in me and lectured me in front of my whole family (my parents, siblings, aunties, uncles, and cousins)... it was my worst nightmare come true.

My grandmother asked me to stop, so I did. She told me I could, and that she used to be a smoker to. She told me if she could quit so could I. She said there would be a voice with a big list of excuses to smoke another cigarette, but I needed to just tell myself to S.T.O.P.

My grandmother is gone now, but she gave me the kick in ass, motivation, and all the tools I needed to quit. I have not looked back since, and am entirely grateful for this final life lesson and gift she has given me. I am so happy to be free of my addiction and to be a non-smoker!

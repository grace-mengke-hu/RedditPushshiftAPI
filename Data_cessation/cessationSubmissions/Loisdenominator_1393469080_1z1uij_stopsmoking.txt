Other than the cost of the actual cigarettes, what other financial costs did/do you incur from smoking?

So today I enrolled in my employer's benefit plan as a non-smoker. Wow. I can afford more coverage. Whereas before I was getting a payroll deduction, the allotted credits now cover all I need (Canadian healthcare system here, this is for prescription drug, dental and other incidentals).

I also used to drive to and from work so I could have the 'freedom' to smoke at my leisure. Cost: gas + downtown parking+ time. I now take the train.

I'm sure there are other such costs. Having to drink more coffee to get the caffeine effect...am I overreaching here? Haha. Just giddy with the excitement of ticking off that non smoker box.

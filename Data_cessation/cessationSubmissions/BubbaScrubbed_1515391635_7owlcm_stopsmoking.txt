70 days smoke free

After smoking for approximately 17 years and many attempts to quit, I finally feel like I have nailed it, I went cold turkey 70 days ago and I haven't lit up since. I don't intend to look back on it or to go back to it ever again, it gets so much easier as time goes on, I never believed it when I was still a smoker, but I realized it's kinda like a faith thing, and truly, if you have faith that it does eventually get better and you take it one minute at a time and then one hour at a time and one day at a time, eventually those minutes seem less important, then the hours and then the days and then it's been months and you have no idea how you got there.

within the first 7 days every time I had the urge, I went for power walks, I must have taken 20+ walks a day, it was a wild ride but I am so glad that I am no longer lighting up. 

Now I live for the gym and I joined the local Rugby union and for the first time in what feels like forever I can keep up.

"I smoke, but I'm not a smoker"

I alternate between not smoking, social smoking, and fiend smoking, and yet somehow I never came around to describe myself as a "smoker." I feel like I could take it or leave it... but recently it dawned on me that I've had this mentality for FIVE years now. Making this post for a bit of accountability (telling my friends lost its weight a long time ago), because this time I want to LEAVE IT for good. 

Cheers! We can do it!

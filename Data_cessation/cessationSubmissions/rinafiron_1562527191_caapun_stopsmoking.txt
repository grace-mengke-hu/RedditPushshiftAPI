Just finished a pack. Words of encouragement to keep me from buying another?

Been trying to quit for a couple of weeks but always come up with a reason why it’s ok to buy a new pack once I finish one off. The “not one more puff” mantra seems helpful as do the badges in the Smoke Free app, but is there anything else that’s been helpful for y’all?

Tonight is the real challenge

Hi. So I have been off cigarettes for 5 days and it is going great so far. Tonight I will be drinking and I think it may be a challenge. Cigarettes and alcohol have been an inseparable pairing for me over the past 5 years and  I fear it may trigger some cravings.

I could avoid drinking for another week or two but I will have to do it at some point ( unless I give it too) and tonight my friend is having a party that I feel I can't miss.

Any tips for avoiding failure in a situation like this where my inhibitions will be lowered and I will be surrounded by smokers?

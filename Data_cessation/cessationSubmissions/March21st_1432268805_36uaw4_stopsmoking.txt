I'm 17 and I started smoking almost 1 year ago...

And I want to stop. As it stand, I only smoke once or twice a week, but when I smoke I smoke maybe half a pack or so and I've been slowly but surely smoking more and more as time goes on. Already the idea of a night out in a pub or club seems impossible without smoking. The only thing stopping me giving up completely is that I seem to get anxiety when I have gone a few days without one, and I'd rather just smoke than have the constant anxiety. I'm kind of scared to be honest, because I know I could quit this addiction before it completely consumes me, but I'm afraid to in case my anxiety goes through the roof. Why I ever started smoking I don't know, just to experiment, but I did and I'm here now and I'll just have to deal with it. 
Thanks to anyone out there who might have read this

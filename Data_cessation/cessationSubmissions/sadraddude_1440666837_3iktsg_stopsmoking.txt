36 days free of E-cigs!

I know it's unconventional to post about E-cigs here, but I started smoking E-cigs when I was 15. All my friends had one so I figured I might as well start smoking because they did it. Fast forward 3 years, I'm now 18 and E-cig free, and it feels great to be free of the electronic ball and chain!

HOW I QUIT SMOKING WEED

so i know most of the people on here are probably addicted to smoking nasty cigarettes, but my smoking problem was with weed.  now i just vape wax out of my wax pen.  its wayy cleaner and doesnt fuck up my throat or taste like shit.  the next step is quitting thc all together, slowly but surely ill wean myself off.  its hard though after smoking weed everyday for almost 6 years. 

also,  why does anyone smoke cigarettes at all.  ive smoked probably 5 cigs my whole life and they have all tasted 100x worse than the shittiest of mids weed i could find.  just the taste and smell alone of cigs make me want to throw up where im standing.  when people smoke cigs in the car it makes me feel like i cant breathe.  how does the average person honestly want to smoke cigs? or feel like its a good buzz?  because if we are being honest cigs smell and taste like shit and give u a shitty buzz.  

it would not be hard at me for all to quit cigs bc they are already so dam nasty and harsh.  weed is different because it makes u feel great other than burning your throat when u smoke.  it also tastes good and to me it smells wayyy better than cigs.  

i wont date girls who smoke cigs, and i dont hang around people who do.  they are disgusting.  little cancers prerolled and put into a box.  i really dont understand how anyone could get addicted to them.  i understand how people get addicted to weed but not cigs lol.

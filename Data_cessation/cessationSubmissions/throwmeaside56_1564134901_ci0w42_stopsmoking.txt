Wow, not smoking when drinking pretty much makes the hangover only quarter as bad

Usually even just 4 pints would have me horrible all the next day. Last Saturday i had 6 pints and woke up not too shabby. Last night i had 4 and a half pints and feel absolutely fine!

Can't believe how much smoking contributed to hangovers.

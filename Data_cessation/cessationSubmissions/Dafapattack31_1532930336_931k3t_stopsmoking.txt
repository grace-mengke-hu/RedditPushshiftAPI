Well almost 160 days under my belt

Before you go off giving me praise let me tell you I'm not special. I have my ups and downs and sometimes I still want to smoke badly but I don't have to anymore and I love it. I can breathe again and taste again. I've been riding my bike and running hell I dropped close to 45lbs after I quit just being active something I would've avoided completely when I was a smoker. Hats off to those that just quit, those that stayed quit, and those quitting again. I'll breathe comfortably tonight because of this community, cheers.

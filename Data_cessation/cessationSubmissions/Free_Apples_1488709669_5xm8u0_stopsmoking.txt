Checking in at 1500 days. Quitting as truly changed my life.

I haven't been here in maybe 1-2  years at least. Randomly saw a post on my feed and saw my flair at exactly 1500 days. Can't believe it!

I remember around 1500 days ago was January 2013 and I had just moved back in with my parents not knowing what I was going to do with my life. I was at my lowest of lows and absolutely depressed. My *childhood dog* even passed away not long after I moved back in. I remember being jobless and out of my mind and decided I had to do something -- just anything at all -- that was positive and would better myself. So I quit smoking. It was the one thing I could assert control over in my life at the time. And that first big step eventually snowballed into so much more. Here I am now in my own apartment about 4 years and 1700 miles away from my parents' house, and I'm about to graduate from college with an engineering degree.

It's truly been a crazy 4 year journey and I don't ever plan on slowing down. Hope everyone out there is pulling through, all you have to do is make it until tomorrow!

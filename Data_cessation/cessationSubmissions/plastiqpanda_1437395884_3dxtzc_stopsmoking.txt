I feel like it is different now

I started smoking when I was 12. Next year I complete a decade on cigarettes. Wow, it seems like yesterday. 

I do not smoke since Sunday, but I only decided to stop right now. I look back on how I was when I was 16 and I miss almost everything about my physical condition. I want to reach (and be better than) my old self, not only by quitting smoking, but training, losing weight and starting to play a sport, like football. 

And about the title: I quitted many times. Many times. But that is the first time I really want to quit. And I know how strong my will is when I want something. I hope I am stronger than the habit. 

Thanks for this great subreddit!

The biggest shame

I WAS a social smoker. I quit smoking during pregnancies and breast feeding. I had to quit breast feeding my youngest early due to medication I needed to take, so the past 2 years I slowly started smoking with morning coffee, work breaks, going out for drinks, etc. I'd say an average of a pack a week. June 11 2014 my then 3 year old daughter was diagnosed with leukemia. You'd think a mom would immediately cold turkey cigs upon this information, but I smoked MORE. My daughter has seen my mother in law smoke, as she is a heavy smoker-- she had never seen me smoke until recently. After I'd smoke while my daughter was up, I'd run inside and wash my hands furiously, shower, and brush my teeth. Anyway, I finally decided what I was doing was horrid and quit 8 days ago. Day 3 of my withdrawal  I was grocery shopping with the kids. They were eating lollipops, and here my 4 year old daughter in cancer treatment says "I'm pretending I'm smoking". So much shame. So. Much. I can not ever go back, so I found this group. Thanks for reading.

I failed but I'm not giving up

Last night i finished the Allen Carr book and i felt like for the first time that i can actually quit.  I have failed after 12 hours but I'm not discouraged.  I feel like I'm actually going to kick this monkey off my back.  Im sure that Allen Carr probably gets recommended a lot here but I'll just say it again.  He book does (and in my case will) work

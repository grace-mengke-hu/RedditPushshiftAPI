Question : How long after a quit before your body stops feeling weird? Not the urge to smoke. Just the stupid pain.

Is it a week? a few weeks? my last proper quit was really successful. more than 500 days. this time im quitting because im kinda bored of cigarettes. theyre really not all that. yea sure theyre fun. but its a lot of work... paying to kill yourself. smelling like shit. getting sick and then having to smoke. so wonderful....

i really enjoyed not having cigs in my life and here we go again. 

just curious how long before i stop feeling strange. i dont care about the sudden urge to smoke a cig. because i know that can last years. you will always be tempted. yea sure the first few months are harder than the next few years. but its really a decision you make to not go back that can be broken at any time. there is no magical lure after a year.

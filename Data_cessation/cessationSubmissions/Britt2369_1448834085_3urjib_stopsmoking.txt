Hey guys, looking for a specific app.

Hey, I've been doing some searching for some apps to help with quitting. Most of them all to have the same concept, and all seem great, but there was one I read about that has little 3-5 minute games you can play when you are having a bad craving, only issue is this app is for android only. Anyone know of any iOS apps that has something similar? I feel like the little games that only last a couple minutes could be a great distraction during a craving!

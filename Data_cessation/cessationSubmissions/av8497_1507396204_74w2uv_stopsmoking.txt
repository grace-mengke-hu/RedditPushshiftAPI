Day 2

I'm a light smoker, a social smoker. I've been smoking one cigarette a day for about 8 months (stopped smoking for 4 months in between) if I'm in university and I smoke two on the last working day of the week. But when I'm at home, for as long as I am at home, I never feel the need to smoke. I had summer holidays for about 4 months, did not smoke at all. As soon as university started, I was back at it again... One cigarette a day.

I want this to stop, and I know it's really doable... I'm at a semi-stressful stage in my life and I know smoking isn't gonna help me relieve it, but god I love the buzz half a cigarette gives me. I've never felt the need to increase the number of cigarettes I consume in a day in the past 4 months I spent as a smoker.

I just don't want my family to find out that I had this phase, I don't want it to show up in any X-rays or CAT scans or whatever...

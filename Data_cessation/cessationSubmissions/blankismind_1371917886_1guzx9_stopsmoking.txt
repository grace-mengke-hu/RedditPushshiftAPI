Day25: Things About Smoking I Don't Miss

The one thing I will not miss the most about smoking is when winter rolls around. No matter how warm I would keep my feet, when it was cold out inevitably they would start itching and feeling funny. I found out after this kept happening it was because of lack of blood flow due to the constant cancer stick puffing. When I feel tempted now, it's only been 25 days since I was re-born out of the ashes as a non-smoking phoenix, I like to think of how much that sucked.

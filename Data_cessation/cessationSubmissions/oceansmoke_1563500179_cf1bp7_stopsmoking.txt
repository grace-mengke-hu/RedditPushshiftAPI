I love you but I can't do this anymore.

We've known each other for 15 years. You're the oldest and truest friend I've ever had. You have been with me for every 5 am morning, every heartbreak, upset and moment of stress. You have stood by me when I've lost friends, family, pets. I wouldn't say you're cheap but you're value is immense to me you're quiet and dependable, loyal and consistent. 

You're bad for my health but good for my mental health. You'll kill me but I don't know how I'm going to survive without you. You give me time for quiet contemplation and have never judged me, hurt me or let me down. Getting off a flight or a train I look forward to being with you more than anything. 

I've got to leave you, it can't be just a break it has to be forever, it's not you, it's me... I love you so much that even though we haven't been together in 4 days now, you're all I can think about. It's 2 AM and you're the only thing in my head. You're the only thing that's been in my head for the last 4 days. 

I know I'm doing the right thing, it feels like the weight has been lifted off my chest and I'm finally  breathing clearly for the first time in years. I used to swim ( I could do 50m breaststroke underwater no breathing easily, I could really hold a note on the sax) I gave up a lot of things I loved to be with you. 

It still hurts to leave though, I'll always love you but we just can't be together anymore. Hopefully this time I've got the strength to make it be  forever.

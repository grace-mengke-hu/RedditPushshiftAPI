Hopefully the last time

I've tried quitting before and going cold turkey only lasts up to 4 months before i cave and buy another pack. 

My habit is ruining my marriage and frankly making me depressed. But no matter how hard i tryn i just cant quit for good. So this time i'm gonna buckle down. Grab my orange juice and sunflower seeds and buckle down for the long haul.

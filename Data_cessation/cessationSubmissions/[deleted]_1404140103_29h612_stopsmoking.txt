So can I have just one ?

It's been about 3 weeks using the patch. I find it keeps my mind off wanting to smoke. However, sometimes I just get this feeling that I just want to smoke one. Just one then, Go back to not smoking ! 

When does this feeling subside ? 
Is it ok to have one? 

People that have quit for a while now do you ever think about having a smoke ? Or does it not phase you anymore?

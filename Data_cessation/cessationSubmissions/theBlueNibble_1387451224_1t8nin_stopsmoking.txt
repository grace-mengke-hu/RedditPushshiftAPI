I am done. Again!

I cant breath. I put off going climbing with friends because i dont think i can hack it and dont want them to find out how bad it is. I smell terrible. I think my procrastination has got a lot to do with smoking (i will start the task after the next smoke). I have put on weight. i am miserable in general.

I will read the Allan Carr book. And never smoke again.

(this isnt meant for any one in particular, just wanted to put it here so i remember why i am quitting. but thanks for reading :) )

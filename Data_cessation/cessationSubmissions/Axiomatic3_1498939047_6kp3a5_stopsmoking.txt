What's the best way to try and get a loved family member to consider quitting?

So my Dad has smoked his whole life, from the age of 12. I've been on and off cigarettes for most of my adulthood, but a few months back quit using Allen Carr's book & video, and I think I'm done for good now. I would love to get my Dad to see how easy it actually is to quit and how good it feels to overcome the nightmare. The thing is I don't know how to tactfully address the subject without seeming like a disrespectful upstart. I hate watching him hurt himself like this and just want him to know there is a better way to live. 

Any advice on how to school a parent?

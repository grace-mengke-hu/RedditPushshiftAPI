Agony atop agony

So a week ago my girlfriend of over a year broke up with me. We both smoked during our relationship but I had never had a problem with cigarettes before. I have smoked for about 4 years on and off and never had any withdrawals or cravings. Now that things are over between us I decided it would be best I quit smoking and try to get my life more organized. Problem is I can't tell if my anxiety is because of the cigarettes or the break up. My question to you all is should I wait to quit until I feel better about my situation or just trek through it. I am writing this in the midst of an anxiety attack so sorry for any bad grammar

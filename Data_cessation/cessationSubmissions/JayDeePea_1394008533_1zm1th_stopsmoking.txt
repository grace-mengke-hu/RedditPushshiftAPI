Stopped cold turkey a week ago... Stress at work is driving me insane.

Ended up having a smoke last night because of stress at work... My head was killing me, eyes sore and damp, in my desperation I had a smoke... How can I handle these stressful times to prevent me from lighting up?

I was like that for a good 20 minutes before giving in... Felt instantly better.

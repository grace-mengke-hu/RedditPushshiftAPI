Hit my two week mark today! Feeling great!

Hey everyone I hit my two week mark today and I am feeling great! Yesterday was the first day that I did not have any noticeable cravings. to celebrate I went to go see oblivion. By my reckoning I have saved $98.00 so far so I decided a treat was in order.

I know I have a long way to go still but I can finally see doing this instead of just resisting clawing my eyes out until I break and buy a pack. All your posts have been extremely helpful and I hope you all are doing well with your efforts.

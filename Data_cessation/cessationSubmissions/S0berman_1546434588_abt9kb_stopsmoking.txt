A post for myself that I can read when I feel like giving in.

S0berman, you want to be healthy, active and happy.

Smoking does not give you health benefits. It ruins your health. You feel lethargic after smoking. Your lungs are suffering with each puff.

Smoking is not in align with your values. You want to be the best version of yourself. Smoking is destroying your body and your mind. It is poison. Please, anytime you get a craving please reflect a bit. The cravings will be easier to handle after a while. 

Smoking costs you around 10€ a week. In a month you'll save 40€. In a year you'll save 480€. 

You are not a smoker. You've been lured into a chemical and psychological trap by the tobacco companies, the society and your addiction. You are not meant to die of illnesses caused by tobacco. You used to run 15 km on one standing because you enjoyed the feeling it gave you. Now you don't even run anymore cause you can't.

You are meant to be active, healthy and happy. Please: do not smoke just for today.

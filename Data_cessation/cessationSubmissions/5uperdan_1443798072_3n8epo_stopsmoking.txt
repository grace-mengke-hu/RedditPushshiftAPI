Thank you /r/stopsmoking

So I posted here a fortnight ago asking for quitting advice. 
I followed your advice and read Allen Carr's book and finished it last Tuesday. I haven't had a cigarette since. I've had no cravings, no desire to smoke and absolutely no regrets. 
I know I'll never smoke again, period. 

I can't thank you guys enough for the feelings of freedom I currently have. I feel so much happier and relaxed. 

You guys are awesome.

Just started my second attempt

After transferring money from my savings account for the 6th month in a row, I was so done with not making the end of the month with my money I decided to give it another go and quit again. With some quick maths I figured out I can save up to 300 euros a month, which will come in handy. 

Just felt the need to share my story. 

Wish me luck.

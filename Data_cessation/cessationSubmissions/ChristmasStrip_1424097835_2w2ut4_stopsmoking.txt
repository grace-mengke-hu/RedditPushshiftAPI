Two Years Today

Two years ago, today, I stopped smoking.  I was a 1.5 - 2 pack a day kind of guy and loved every one. I truly loved them. But today, I am very thankful to be tobacco free.

If you use tobacco and would like to be free, read this little book.  Allen Carr's East Way to Stop Smoking.  Link Below.  Keep using tobacco when you start, but by the end you will be an ex smoker/dipper/chewer/etc. No scare tactics. No, just use your will power crap. The book will teach you will reason your way to freedom. And you will be done.  It is that simple.

I know you can do this.  You know you can too.

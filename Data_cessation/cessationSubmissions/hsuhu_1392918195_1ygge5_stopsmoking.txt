Seriously, how are you guys doing it?

Ok 

I've been trying for the past month to fucking quit this shit. My record has been 4days. I managed to abstain sometimes for 1 day, sometimes for 2 days. But the craving just gets to big. 

The funny thing is I feel so good when I don't smoke. But everytime I think about how nice it is to not smoke, I want one. I've read allen carrs book multiple times, but I just can't do it.  

I tried to stay busy, as much as possible. But there will always be times when I will have nothing to do. Sometimes I get those strong cravings in the evening, sometimes in the morning and that's when I usually fail. It just gets so overwhelming. It feels so dumb. When I try to quit my life circles around smoking, when I am smoking I curse myself and think about how I wish I could just stop. I feel doomed. 

I just can't even imagine how some of you guys manage to go for a whole year. Even for a couple of weeks. I feel like if I could just go for a week it would get easy for me. But I can't even do that. Even when I feel so good without cigarettes I can't help but miss cigarettes. 

Ok, I understand I don't actually like them, it's just addiction to the nicotine. But that doesn't really help me. I'm craving for one anyways.
I tried to write a diary, I tried to do some voice massage, telling myself that it's not worth it. But it doesn't seem to work. 

PLease tell me how you guys are doing it. I don't feel like I can quit this awful habit. I feel like I am forever doomed to be a smoker all my life.

I also, don't really try any of those patches or gums, they kinda disgut me. 

MUCH respect for you guys, who managed to quit. Please pass your wisdom on me to help me quit this shit.

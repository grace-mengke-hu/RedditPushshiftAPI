Today is one year!

Last year on this day I was sitting in a hospital parking lot smoking the last cigarette that was in my pack while waiting for my mom who was at an appointment. I did not tell anyone I was trying to quit. I was using chantix to help. But when I got done with that cancer stick I said that is it I am done. No thought process was involved I know you are supposed to pick a date but the times I tried with a date it never worked. This time i did it on my terms. Today I was so happy to get the one year trophy. It has been a hard road but I was a smoker longer than I have been able to drive a car. If you got this far and are trying trust me you can do it!! You just have to know do it on your own terms don't try to live up to someone else's terms or process because everybody's different.

Quitzits...did you experience it?

I've read most people went through it. Anyone here with good skincare regime even before quitting and still suffered quitzits? 

I have a pretty strong skincare regime, daily chemical exfoliation (AHA / BHA),  facial laser rejuvenation on a quarterly basis plus been on a ketogenic diet for years now (no sugar and carbs), 

Would taking Zinc and Niacinamide supplements help? Saw somewhere that when we stop smoking, our zinc level goes down...? The more I read about quitzits, it's seriously disturbing my head...I know it's definitely better than cancer and all that fatal crap cigarettes can give you. Just seeking out some thoughts and tips...

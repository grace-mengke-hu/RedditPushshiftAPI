I've been smoke free since July. I had to delete my quit smoking apps because all they did was remind me that cigarettes exist and how bad I wanted one. When I got rid of my reminders, I slowly forgot about them.

Of course, I can't escape *every* reminder that they exist - of course TV still glorifies smoking, and drinking is a temptation to say the least. But when I'm able to get into my own mind and remind myself how much better I can breathe, I can exercise better, I'm losing weight, I smell better, food tastes better, etc... The benefits of quitting seem way better than smoking.

Getting across that little borderline between "Damn that sounds amazing" and "Damn I feel way better" is tough, but once you cross it, life gets a little nicer.

I hope you are all doing well on your journeys of smoke-free living. I know I am. I love you all.

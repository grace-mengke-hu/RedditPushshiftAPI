How do I get my dad to quit smoking? He's 68 and been smoking since college. He knows it's horrible, but does it to relax. He won't try nicotine gum, or prescriptions.

Any ideas (other than guilting him - doesn't work)? I was successful in getting him to give up drinking. I almost feel bad trying to get him to quit smoking as well...help?

I smoked one single cigarette last weekend. Am I screwed? I feel like I failed, even though I haven't had another since.

So last Saturday I had a few too many drinks and had one single cigarette after weeks of cold turkey. I had a few cravings Monday, but now I feel back to normal. I feel like a failure though. Will the cravings keep coming back? Have I ruined the past few weeks of not smoking?

EDIT:
Thanks everyone!  I think the reason it messed with my head is because I started realizing that the reason I smoked the cigarette was because I viewed it as a "reward" for not smoking for so long.  I didn't realize it at the time, but I can see it now in hindsight. 

It's strange how your own brain can lie to you, and how manipulative you can be to yourself by justifying anything, haha.

Anyway, thanks again for the support everyone!

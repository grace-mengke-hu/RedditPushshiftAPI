Third Attempt

Hello

This is my third attempt tryna quit smoking.

First attempt was very unsuccesful. I don't even remember.

Second attempt lasted a year and four months.

For the dumbest reason I went smoking in my new house again. It was cool in the beginning, thinking it was just for a short time, had to finish the pack I bought and now I'm back to a pack a day.

Oh yeah I made up this character in my head who just begins smoking after quitting again because quitting feels so good. 

Weird eh, addicted to no smoking.

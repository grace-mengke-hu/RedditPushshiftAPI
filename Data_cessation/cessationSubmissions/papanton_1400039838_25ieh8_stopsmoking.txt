Smoking leads to self loathing.

I have a little ritual. When I go to sleep I promise myself that the cigarette I just did was my last. I set up the smoking counter in my phone and go to sleep thinking of all the bad effects of smoking. I am resolute in my decision not to smoke and I feel good about myself. 

Fast forward 6 am. I wake up, I convince myself not to smoke. I eat my breakfast and somewhere between 7am and 10am one of those little bastards are between my fingers and hot smoke is flowing through my lungs. The first one is excellent, almost every single one that follows is filled with self pity. 

I come home reminding myself of my lack of strength. I spend about 20 mins in the shower thinking about how this is the last day. I smoke my last cigarette and throw the remaining of the pack away. Set my "since last cigarette timer"  and I fall asleep. 

Rinse and repeat. 

I hope one of this days my resolution will be stronger. That the  bag of gym clothes I carry everyday to work are going to be of use. And that I will finally be free of my little tormentor. 

If you reached until here, thank you for reading my gibberish, I just had to vent somewhere.

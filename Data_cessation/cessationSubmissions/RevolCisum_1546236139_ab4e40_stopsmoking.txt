29 Days

Hit my 4 week badge, and not a single drag.  I'm still using nicotine lozenges, but I'm getting tired of them, so may work on stopping those soon too.  I just gained a lot of weight on my last quit and was trying to avoid that.  So far, my weight is holding steady.  I feel pretty good.  

I like seeing everyone's days increasing!!!!  All of us breathing better.  And smelling better!

Survey: Emotional/physical effects of Chantix

Hello /r/stopsmoking community!  My boyfriend is starting Chantix tomorrow.  I would like to hear some stories from people in this community who have used Chantix.  How did it affect your mood?  Did you notice any physical effects from the drug?  I want to be informed and ready for any changes in his character.  I know how difficult quitting can be.

Smoking - advice needed

Hey folks

I'm 24 years of age, and have been smoking 10-15 a day for 5 years now.

Unfortunately my health during this time has declined rapidly from a healthy state to bordering on severely ill.

Severe asthma, eczema and even a bout of pneumonia at one point have affected my mental and physical state severely.

My longest quitting period has been for just one month.

The motivation for better health is driving me at the moment. 

The anxiety of quitting smoking is heavy though.

Any and all advice would be very appreciated.

Thanks.

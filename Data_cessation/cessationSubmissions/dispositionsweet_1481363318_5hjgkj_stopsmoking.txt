I'm drunk, haven't smoked in 3 years, went to a party and had half a cigarette. How screwed am I?

I haven't smoked in 3 years. Have had urges, but never wanted to smoke. I haven't smoked in 3 years and I was really proud of it. I'm in school to become a nurse, I mean come on! I never thought I would smoke again, I mean it was a never ever want to ever, and then I just did it! Wtf. I'm powerless after a few too many beers. I haven't been to a house party in awhile and I guess it got out of hand. Am I cancer prone already just like that? Man I'm disappointed...

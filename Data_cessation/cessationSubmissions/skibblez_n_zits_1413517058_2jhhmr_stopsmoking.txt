Just realized it's been 2 years...

Was having dinner with my girlfriend the other night and realized it has been two years to the day since I quit.  Believe it or not I had actually *forgotten* I used to be a smoker until we were talking about setting goals and I remembered the dirty little habit I used to have.

Just wanted to drop in here and say thank you to everyone on this board.  I couldn't have quit without the help I received here and this is such a great community and a great resource.

For the record, I was a pack (or more) a day smoker for over a decade.  I started in my late teens and quit when I turned 30.

My quit date was Friday, Oct. 12th, 2012, and I smoked an entire pack that day, and not a single one since.

Alright, here's my two cents/advice/things that helped me, etc...

1.  **The badge.**  If you don't have a badge, get one.  I know it seems like a silly little thing, but it really helped me in the beginning.

2.  **Find a distraction for your mouth and hands.**  Me personally, I carried around a small box of toothpicks (about the size of a pack of cigarettes) in my pocket, and I would pull one out and chew on it when I needed to... which was constantly at first haha.  I was like a puppy, I was chewing on everything!  Eventually it goes away, but having something in your hands/mouth besides a dirty, nasty cancer-stick is a necessity.  A lot of people seem fond of e-cigs.  Me personally, I never did the e-cig, but it might work for some.

3.  **Do not be afraid.**  In my opinion, this is the most important one.   Fear itself is the single biggest obstacle to quitting.

I remember thinking stuff like "Oh God, what if this is the last cigarette I ever smoke?  How can I go the rest of my life without ever having another one??  What if I go to my grave having never smoked again?"

Bullshit.

Your thoughts may or may not be that extreme, but you get the point.  Negative thoughts of desperation like those are simply ridiculous.  The fact is, **millions and billions** of people on this planet, just like you, wake up and go about their lives everyday and never even think about touching a cigarette...  cigarettes do not even factor in their lives or minds at all.   I am now one of those people... and you will be too.

Okay, that's all I got.  Best of luck to you all, I know you can do it!

Week 3 - Brain Fog

I am on day 16 and I am still experiencing major issues with 'brain fog'.  I am having trouble focusing, remembering things, motivating, and just feel 'disassociated'.  From reading, I see this is common in the beginning.  Has anyone else had issues like this going into week 3 and longer? Any coping mechanisms that you might recommend?  Btw,  I quit cold turkey - no NRT so I have been going through full nicotine withdrawal.   Thanks in advance!

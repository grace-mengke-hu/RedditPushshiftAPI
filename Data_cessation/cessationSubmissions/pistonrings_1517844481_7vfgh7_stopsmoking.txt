Two weeks.

I'm still going.  The first week was really tough.  The second week, two days were hard and the rest manageable.  Also I never know when I'm getting a bad day because it's kind of random now.  I know any day I get will never be as bad as the first day and I'm not going through that again.

Well done to anybody who stayed stopped.

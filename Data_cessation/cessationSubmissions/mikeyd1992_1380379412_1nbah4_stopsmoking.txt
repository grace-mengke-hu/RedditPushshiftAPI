For those of you on day one, and those of you on day one thousand

Don't give up. I hit my magical number. 3 Weeks. Scientifically my body has been clear of nicotine for a few hours. In three weeks I have regained my appetite, my sense of smell, and like I said before, food has a whole third dimension of flavor I never realized was there. If you are on day one, you can be here. If I did my math correctly, I saved myself $274.00. You can do this! It is okay! All your cravings will go away even when you don't smoke! And to those of you who have reached day 1000, look out, because I only have 979 days in between you and I!

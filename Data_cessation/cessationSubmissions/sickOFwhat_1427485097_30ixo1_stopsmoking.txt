The Alcohol / Tobacco Combo

I'm only 24 and have been smoking since I was 19.

4 of those years were as a solid pack a day smoker.

With pressure from my family, then myself I managed to quit for a about 7 months.

I read books, had lazar therapy & good old running --this seemed to work.

the last 2 years however the tobacco demon slowly took over anytime I drank alcohol, or smoked marijuana.

I wrote them off as isolated incidences and never let drag me back to a pack a day smoker.

As so addictions go, I convinced myself cigarettes were fine so-long as I was never sober while smoking them. 
I now find any excuse to get drunk or stoned so long as I have access to cigarettes.  

If it weren't for my job responsibilities I'd be drinking way more than just weekends V.S. A year ago I couldn't imagine drinking more than a beer here or there.

I don't know what I'm asking but this is what I'm going through.

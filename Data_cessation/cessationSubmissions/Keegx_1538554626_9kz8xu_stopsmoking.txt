Champix + personality disorder: possible interactions?

Hey guys, so this morning I went to the doctor and got a prescription for Champix which I heard about from a mate. Since I missed breakfast this morning I decided to wait until tomorrow so I don't have it on an empty stomach.


Was scrolling through threads on Reddit about it out of curiosity, and aside from crazy sounding vivid dreams, it popped up a couple times that its not recommended to take it if you have bad mental health issues?


I didn't specify this to the GP because I didn't think it was relevant, but I have Borderline Personality Disorder, and of course with it all the extremes in moods (brutal depressive episodes, brutal anxiety episodes etc.). Should I be taking this stuff in this case?

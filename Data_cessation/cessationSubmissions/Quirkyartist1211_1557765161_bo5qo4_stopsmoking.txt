I made a dumb decision and started vaping because my friends were all doing it. Now I can’t stop.

I’ll try to make a long story short. I was diagnosed with clinical depression relatively recently, but my parents refused to get me help. My “friends” told me that vaping helps them with their problems, and out of desperation, I started vaping in the hopes that it will make me feel better. It did not, and now I’m addicted. I’m fifteen years old, I don’t have the time, funds, or energy to continue living like this. What’s the best way to quit, and what’s a good way to minimize the effects of withdrawal?

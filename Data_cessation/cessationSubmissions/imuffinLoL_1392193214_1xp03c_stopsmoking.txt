Help me to not start again... i am desperate

So, i stopped smoking 7 months ago. I had 2 cigarettes since then. The first was when my girlfriend got lost, and it happend that i had one i rolled for a friend... well i nearly puked from the taste of this cigarette.
The other one was while i was sitting at 4 a.m. on my rooftop and watched the city slowly wakeing up... didn't taste much because i was drunk as shit.

So the point is, i feel like shit. I know smoking is bad, and i really got to know the benefits of not smoking (i have much more money, can run longer, feel better, food tastes better ect.) but i have recently the desire to start smoking **again**. I recently got told that i maybe loose my job in half a year, my girlfriend is super stressy, and i feel like i fall back into a depression...

Help me :(

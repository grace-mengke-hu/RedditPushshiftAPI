Chest pain/discomfort

Hello! This is one of my first posts, and I’ve recently started my stop smoking journey. However, I have some pretty serious concerns that I was wondering if anyone else has/is experiencing as well. For starters, I’m a 25 year old man. I smoked off and on since I was 15, but I’ve been smoking heavily since I was about 20 or so. Like a pack a day kind of heavy. I’ve tried to quit a couple times before but with little success. This past weekend, I decided to get my head out of my ass and make a genuine effort to stop. I put my last cigarette out Saturday morning and it went well for the first day. But come Sunday, I start having extremely strange sensations in my chest from light pressure, to heavy pressure, to sharp pain, to dull pain, etc that jumps around all over my chest. It’s now Tuesday evening and I’m still experiencing these things, a big concern being pressure around my heart and fatigue. Is this a symptom of withdrawal? Anxiety from lack of nicotine? I fully intend to get a doctors appointment made, but I fear I may be over reacting. Thoughts?

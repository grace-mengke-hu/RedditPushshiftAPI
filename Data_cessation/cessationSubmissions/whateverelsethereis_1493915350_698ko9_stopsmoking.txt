I'm going to become a non-smoker today!

Last cigarette was yesterday. I'm 20 and i've been a "social smoker" since I was 13, but for the past year or so it's been a few cigarettes a day. I told my mom this week I was going to quit and she told me that since I only smoke 3 cigarettes a day that it doesn't matter, and she lets me take her cigarettes for free...so yeah she's not very motivating. However, im doing this for me not for my parents and even if being a light smoker isn't "that bad" I know it's not good for me so I will not smoke today!

50 days

I was chain smoking with no desire to quit at all.  Lost my job which just made it worse.  Doctor put me on Chantix.  I was skeptical, since I have failed in the past to quit when I really wanted to.

But damn, Chantix is magic.  I just finished my 2nd box.  No desire to smoke after the first couple weeks, and most importantly for me was NO ANGER

Previously the anger was a problem.  Now I feel like I did before I even started.

1 box to go, I'm hoping quitting chantix is easy

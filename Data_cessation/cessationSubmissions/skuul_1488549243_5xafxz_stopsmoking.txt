I quit! Also a question.

For the past 6 months i've been trying to quit. But this time I am serious so i'm writing to you guys. I haven't smoked any cigs since yesterday morning but I am using 2mg nicotine gums. I tried without any subs before but I can't function, i get headaches and i constantly try to clear my head so that i can work. But with gums it's easier. What is the feeling towards gums around here? I am planning to try to reduce my usage till the end of this month and quit that too if i can.

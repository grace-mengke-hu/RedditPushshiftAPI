My throat kills!

Today is my forth day without smoking and I have been super sick the entire time. My throat hurts so much, there is mucus all down my throat and chest and I am so tired. My head is constantly hurting as well . I read that a lot of people get "quitters flu" when they quit and it can be pretty full on but it's so unfair. Quitting is hard enough and now I get to deal with feeling like shit for god knows how long which makes me stressed which makes me want to Smoke !!! Why do we get punished for trying to do the healthy thing !

3 days right now.

Not much I can say as I have tried to stop before but haven't wanted to. I've discounted the ways to quit. But it's day 3 for me right now. It fucking sucks. The cravings haven't stopped.

I did the typical thing and wanted to wait when things would get easier. But I was in college at the time, not anymore. Shit's never going to get easier and I need to keep this shit up. 

I feel my triggers. I'm working my hardest at not acting on them. I have an e-cig but with zero nic to at least indulge my physical habit. Helps a bit, but not as much as I would've hoped.

Anyway, this is just a rant that I needed to get off my chest. Thanks all

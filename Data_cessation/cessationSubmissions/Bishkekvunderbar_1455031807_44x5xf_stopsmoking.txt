Day 9 (again)

I made it a month in January before breaking down and having one after a fight with the gf. I decided to reset, cause I'm seeing my badge as 'days not smoked'. Still the same quit though (not seeing it as a relapse), so I haven't reset my no-smoke apps. Sort of upset at myself for breaking down, but all the more determined to go further this time!

Thanks to /u/cslish, /u/gerardo2015, /u/FakoPako, /u/my_vape_self, /u/scenecunt, and /u/detroitdiesel for their support and advice on the reset. I do think resetting the badge comes down to a personal decision. This sub rocks.

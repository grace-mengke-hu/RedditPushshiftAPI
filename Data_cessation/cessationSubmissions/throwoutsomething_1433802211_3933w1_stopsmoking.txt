I am going to quite literally kick your ass.

What have you ever done for me? I thought you were there when times got tough, when I hit breaking point - and yeah, you were there for the first few weeks, but sure enough as I started to rely on you, what did you do? you screwed me; you took more and more money away from me - something you and I both know, was something I needed - something I am only now just recovering from.

Look at all the shit you took away from me - I was losing weight, going to the gym, even dieting for fuck sake, I was finally down to about 180 pounds just to have you come along and break my stride, now look at me - I resemble that chubby fucking teen I was not that long ago.

Fuck you man, fuck you hard. I thought you'd relief my stress, having dealt with far far too much for anyone’s lifetime what am I now? that barely 18 year old who was living on a friends couch just a couple years ago? No. Fuck no. I am a fucking man. I am a fucking adult. I have a great job, I had a promotion for Christ sake! Finally I've started to have enough money to just scrape by for payments on my rental - Oh and what are you doing? holding me down, slowing my ascent from the pavement.

I am done with you - if this medication is worth its salt, which with the way I've been feeling recently, It really is, I will never let you into my life again. I am a stronger person now than I ever was, 6 weeks ago id have come crying back, now? nah, you're out for the count this time.

I am ready for whatever you fancy throwing at me, because I can promise you - I am gonna hang you out to dry. Bat you straight out of the park; you’re gonna be nothing but a black mark in the ashtray that was my old life.

Nic, you’re a good for nothing piece of shit, and you have ruined too many good peoples lives to not take a beating. 

I am coming for you buddy, day one starts today and oh I have my gloves on baby, step into the ring whenever you’re ready...

Quit again after relapsing after pregnancy

I officially quit again today.  I had quit two years ago while I was pregnant with my son for the entire pregnancy cold turkey.  It was a lot easier when you have a life inside of you.  I started smoking again around the time he was 3 months old.  I had really bad post-partum depression, and my husband still smokes.  Let's be honest, I leaned on those excuses to go back to smoking.  


I'm nervous because I know these next 3 days are going to be bad.  I'm already dizzy and a bit disoriented.  The irritability is manageable as long as nothing annoys me and my day goes smooth.  



My son turns 1 at the end of December, and he's my main reason for quitting.  I just hope I can make it.

Shit living situation making quitting ten times harder than it should be

I initially quit two days ago. I have my patches and I have my son staying with me for the next few days. I was happy. I was feeling positive. The sun was basically shining out my arse. And today destroyed everything I was building towards. 
I'm currently living with my aunt and her three kids and this is my problem. My aunt is basically one of those parents where her kids parent her and fuck me they are so stress inducing, her youngest in particular. They drive me up the fucking wall and they are always causing trouble. Whenever I try to step in to either shut them up or put them in their place my voice is essentially useless because it isn't backed up with that of their mothers. Today they broke me and my cravings got the better of me and I smoked. I feel pathetic and I feel like I've lost all self confidence in quitting. This sub inspired me to quit in the first place so now I am looking to you guys for more inspiration. Help me redditors, you're my only hope...

A little over 4 months nicotine free... Do the cravings ever go away?

I'm 4 months and 5 days free of all nicotine. No cigs, dip, or ecigs. 

I was a pack a day and quit cold turkey one random day just to see if I could. 

The money I'm saving is amazing (my marbs were 9.50 a pack here in NY) 

But ..

The cravings don't seem to ever go away. Some days I make it through without a thought of smoking. But most days I'm just "joansing" I have skills now and new routines but it doesn't seem to matter. 

I won't cave... The money is too good. But will these cravings ever end? They drive me loco.

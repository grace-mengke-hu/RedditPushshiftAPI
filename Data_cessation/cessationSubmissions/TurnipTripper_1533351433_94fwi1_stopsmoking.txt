Taking a leap

Hello reddit! My journey to become smoke free started about a week ago when the seed of the idea really took root in my mind. Since then I have identified my triggers, found people to support me, and made a list of alternative activities when cravings come. 

To be honest, I'm scared. I don't know what these withdrawals will do to me mentally, and I'm scared of how I will react when they come. I know that I alone have to do this, and my chances of success are low... BUT, I have to try.

Reddit, I have lurked this sub for a few days, and you made me realize the potential I have. I know I will reach out to this sub again in the coming days, and read all of the new posts to this sub for inspiration. Thanks for being here for me.

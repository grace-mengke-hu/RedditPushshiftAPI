Day 51: fuck tobacco

Just wanted to check in to remind everyone of how much smoking sucks. Amazing how my mind has shifted: I don't want that inhale that burning cancer. I don't want to wake up coughing and feeling like I'm 50 years old when I'm 22. I don't want to be a walking ashtray polutting the air with cancer fumes. I don't want to inhale chemicals used for insecticides and cleaning products. How did I ever want to do it though? I don't even know, the day tobacco ceases to exist and the tobacco industry is nailed into a coffin and buried deep into the ground I will piss on its hypothetical grave.

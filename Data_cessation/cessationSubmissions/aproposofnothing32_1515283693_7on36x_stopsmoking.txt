One Week to Quit

January 13th is my last day of work for five weeks. My best luck quitting has always been accompanied by major change in routine so I'm hoping this can be the catalyst for the real one, the long haul. 
I'm mostly posting this (long time lurker) for accountability but maybe you guys have some advice for how I can better prepare myself? I haven't been cutting back  (I worry that will make each cigarette feel more like a reward) but I have been thinking hard about my quit every time I light up. 
I'll get rid of the ashtray on my balcony. Anything else? 
TIA

Looking for a non-nicotine substitute

Fell off the wagon on the weekend, and I've been having a really hard time fighting my cravings. I've tried e-cigs and vaping before, but I was wondering if anybody has ever had positive experiences with a non-nicotine vape or e-cig? I'd like to try it out to simply replace the habit, without ingesting nicotine while doing it. Thanks!

Day 0 - Anxious as hell, but I'm a'gonna do it.

So ceremonial the "get rid of all remaining snus (it's like chewing tobacco) boxes" has been done. I've struggled for two days on this decisions, a hundred times of "Just one more box?" thoughts, a thousand "You can't do this, you'll be a mess!" worries and so on so forth. 

Tell you the truth, I'm not too optimistic about the whole withdrawal bit, but damned I'll be committed. I've tried and failed before but then I didn't tell a damn soul of my attempts just in fear that if I fail it'll be a bit of a shame, mark of weakness and so on. Silly thoughts, but still it feels monumental enough for me to tell folk about it this time. 

So here's nothing, people. Wish me luck!

I've been cigarette-free for 6 months as of today! Don't give up!

I feel better than I have in years. I breathe more easily. I don't stink anymore. And frankly, the smell of a cigarette makes me want to puke. But most importantly, I am happy with and proud of myself.

Don't give in! You can stay quit! :)

Day 4 - No Smoking / Vaping

After 18 years of smoking (I'm 32) and many attempts to quit, I'm finally ready to say goodbye to this nasty addiction and the lies that I made to protect and hide it.
On Sunday I finished Allen Carr's "The Easy Way" and Monday was my first day of not smoking. Days 1 and 2 were difficult  but yesterday was easier. It feels as though I'm coming out the other side of my nicotine withdrawal.

My issue is that for the last month I switched to vaping and it actually tasted good. Yesterday I was tempted to buy some nicotine-free vape but I called my wife instead.

I feel that I need some accountability partners, so I am going to commit to this group and will post a couple of times a day to check -in.

Thanks everybody and good luck with your own paths. I look forward to reading about them and being there to help too.

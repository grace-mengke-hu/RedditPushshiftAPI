Worked a 9 hour day without a break and it wasn't a big deal.

I had my first day of work at a new job and I wanted to make a good impression.  I ended up working all day without a break.  The old smoker version of me would have been crawling out of my skin by noon, snuck off to chain smoke as many as I could in my time off, changed my shirt and washed my hands and face to try and get rid of the smell and come back to work for a few more hours, constantly checking the clock to see when I could cut out to smoke again.

I have to say that I did get a little stupid craving as I walked home after the work day, but I shot it down and was excited that it didn't hit until after work.  I worked right through lunch.  I'm so happy to not have the constant distraction of a nicotine jones.  I know I still have a long way to go, but it's already getting a bit better.

Hang in there new quitters.  There's hope!

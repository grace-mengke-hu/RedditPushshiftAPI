Day 14 - hit the 2 week mark

I feel like I should've had a better day today. I did not feel the same level of excitement/accomplishment as I did when I hit other milestones (for example, I was ecstatic on day 3 and 1 week). Today, I had more cravings than the last few days combined. Almost felt as if I regressed... Maybe I was just too cocky about my ability to abstain in the earliest stages and this is a simple reality check.

Has anyone further along in this process experienced something similar? Any wisdom about what to expect down the road is deeply appreciated. I'd like to know how it feels to be 1 month down the line, 6 months, 2 years etc...

In the Gym this morning

So one of the reasons I decided to quit smoking was because I'm into an exercise routine to get fit and I figured if I quit smoking I should be able to push myself a little harder and get fitter faster or at least ripped faster. 


So this morning I went into the gym and I improved my BEST rowing time with fucking 21 SECONDS!!! And this is a record that I previously thought I wouldn't never be able to improve on. Then I started jogging and I managed to jog 2 whole minutes without feeling like my body is breaking and coughing my lungs out. That right there has already made it worth it for me :D

Anybody else get chest pains? (26/m)

Hey, folks. Reposting this from r/medical. So I'm 26, I've been smoking for four years, and today I just got the crap scared out of me. There's a dull, persistent ache in the left side of my chest, and it becomes especially pronounced when I take deep breaths. Has this every happened to any of you, former and current smokers? Please be gentle. I'm terrified. 

Also, needless to say, it's time for me to get serious about quitting.

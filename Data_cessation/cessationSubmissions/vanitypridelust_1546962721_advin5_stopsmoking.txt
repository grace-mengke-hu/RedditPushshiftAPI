Purging the paraphernalia!

Today's goal is getting rid of all my smoking stuff. Found an empty pack in my purse this morning and found myself checking if there were any forgotten cigs inside and my brain went NOPE! So it's time for a good clean.

Adios old packs, adios ash trays, adios matches. Adios to rolling papers and a tin of loose leaf. Coupons in a drawer for Camels and Kools? I don't think so. 

My first week I told myself I should hold onto a couple things. Hubby still smokes and so do some of my friends. Seems like a dick move to get rid of perfectly good stuff that others can use, right? Well, I'm thinking not. They can all make do and supply for their own habit. 

The only thing I'm saving is the sand-filled coffee can on the patio so nobody is dropping ashes everywhere when they're forced outside by their addiction, because no one is lighting a damn thing in my house anymore. I can't believe I ever allowed that to begin with. It was only on occasion so I never thought it was *that* bad, but now that my nose is clearer I can smell the musty sour grossness every time I come in from outside and it makes me feel ashamed.

This weekend I'll be scrubbing the walls and ceiling with vinegar and shampooing the carpets. I want a clean, smoke-free house that I can be proud of. I want a clean, smoke-free life that I can be proud of. And I will do what it takes to get it.

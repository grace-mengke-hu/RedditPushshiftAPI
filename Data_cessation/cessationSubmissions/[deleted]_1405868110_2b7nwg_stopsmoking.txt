Had a 2-5 cigs a day habit for less than a month, am I experiencing withdrawal?

I had a very casual habit of a few cigs a day for less than a month and now circumstances cause me to be without nicotine for a few days.  It's been about 3 days now and I felt the peak of my irritability this morning and had horrible insomnia last night (however, i usually slight insomnia anyway and I'm without my meds so it could just be that).  I'm assuming it's withdrawal, my question is, how long will this last.  I'm not concerned with cravings or anything like that, I have decent self control and I most likely won't relapse or anything because my habit isn't too strong and I'm not feeling serious cravings, it's more about just wanting to feel normal again but smoking to feel better is out of the question.  

TL;DR 2-5 cigs a day habit, feeling what I think is withdrawal, how long will it last? What can I do to curb the symptoms.

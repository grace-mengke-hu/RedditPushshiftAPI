Made a badge, but I forgot to make a post, felt I should update how I feel to urge you guys to continue to thrive in your endeavors!

Was a pack (newports) every 3-4 day smoker since 17, except for the weekends where it was more like pack a day, whilst bumming them out to friends/co-workers. I'm a DJ and I use to believe it helped with the associated stress that comes with that. 

Anyways i'm over a month into quitting and I don't even remotely think about smoking. My sense of smell is amazing, I can step outside and really smell things again.. it's great, but on the same note I can notice a cigarette smoker from distances away now. I also went to the casino not too long ago and gagged at the blackjack table when the guy next to me was smoking, but it was cool.. I knew at that point I had made it.. The day I quit, i didn't make anything fancy out of the situation, I just did it cold turkey. It's hard, especially the first few days... What really motivated me to quit was this sub and looking at the benefits of quitting asap. i started as a social smoker, but i knew that when i picked it up I wasn't going to live my entire life as a smoker, and the day has come when that part of me left. Thanks guys <(-.-<)(>-.-)>


 I do vape now though.. I have an ipv2 box mod with an atlantis tank (including this info just incase you guys want to check out what has really helped me to avoid cigs, not for promo purposes). I know most people don't think this is quitting, but I do. The juices I use are mostly fruity flavors and low in nicotine (3 mg) which has just enough of a buzz for me to enjoy it and it not be too harsh.  you can msg me if you want for flavor recommendations, i want to avoid too much product placement in this post. 

Edit: 21 now

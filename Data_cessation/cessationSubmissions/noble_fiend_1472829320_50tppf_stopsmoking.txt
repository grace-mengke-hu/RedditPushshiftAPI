Thank god it is trash day!

So I woke up this morning and decided I was not going to smoke, is this a daily decision I have to make?  Rough wake up, first thing I thought was, "I have snipes in the trash!"  I quickly threw that trash into the large trash can.  Has that happened to anyone else?  I am sure it has.

Thank god it is trash day.  I plan on keeping myself busy today, I am going to go mountain biking!  I haven't done that in 3 or 4 years.

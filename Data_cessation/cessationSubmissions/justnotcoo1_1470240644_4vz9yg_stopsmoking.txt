26 yrs Enough, day 2 here I come!

I want to thank everyone who encouraged me through out the day yesterday. I pulled my phone out everytime I thought about quitting and I read your messages.  The euphoria of actually accomplishing a day without cigarettes has worn off. I am left with annoyance. My SO is in grave danger today y'all. I have not lashed out, but I want to scream at the poor man. I am aware that this is only temporary and I usually actually like this guy. I have quarantined myself in living room till I get over the fact that every little tiny thing he does makes me want to smoke. He is supportive and understands that my self imposed hiatus from the bedroom is only to shield him from my saltiness. He is totally undeserving of my irrational, in withdrawal brain. (I am telling you this so that I can remind myself btw)Someone yesterday told me I had to basically commit to being a bad ass in order to beat this thing. He wrote something like "no excuses." At the first read, I thought, "man, what a dick." (no offence dear human who wrote that) Today, I feel that! I am digging deep for this day already. I am working on my bad assness. I think about sneaking one drag. I have a hundred excuses. Man, my mind is making up all sorts of shit to rationalize why I should sneak into my garage and light up. Just one. But then I remember"No excuses" guy and my ass stays glued to my quarantine couch. Day 2. Let's do this.

I can't believe I smoked :(

I was doing my hourly stairs run in the office, you know, just to get my lungs pumpin' :) Got myself a little tired and I though:" Damn, I can't believe I smoked! I can't believe I smoked for that long!" Since I was 16-17 years old! That's 23-24 years!!!That's more than half of my life, I been blowing money and polluting my body. I really hate to think about what my lungs looks like if I could open up my chest. The only thing that makes me kind of happier is that in few years, I will be able to say that I was non-smoker for more than half of my life. What a waste that was. I regret it so much right now. It is so easy to fall into this trap and start destroying your fresh body, but it's so hard to get out of it, not to mention, hopefully reverse the effects. 

Ughhh...keep at it everyone! You can do it!

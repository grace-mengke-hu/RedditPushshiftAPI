This Bit From Allen Carr's EasyWay Makes Me Nervous

**"When smokers cough it is because their lungs are trying to get rid of the cancer-triggering tars and irritants contained in tobacco smoke. When they don't cough, the poison remains in their lungs, and this is when they can cause cancer and the many other horrendous diseases associated with smoking."**

In my 16 years of smoking, (10 or so cigarettes per day, lights) I never had the "smoker's cough." And since I have quit... 74 days now... I have not coughed up any goo or anything else like many other quitters do.

There's no real point to this post. Haha. Obviously Allen Carr is not a doctor, and everyone is different. (I hate that answer). It's just... somebody make me feel less worried about it! =D

I need to quit but I can't

I go to uni and I get so stressed I can't resist having a cigarette. A lot of people on campus smoke so it's really hard to resist when it's all around me, or when my friends offer.

I have to quit smoking because I've started HRT and if I continue, it can cause some pretty big health problems.

How do you guys handle temptation? I feel like if I can make it through the first few days, it will be a lot easier. I just can't seem to do it.

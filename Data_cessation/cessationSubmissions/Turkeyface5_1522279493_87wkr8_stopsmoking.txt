How did you guys substitute going outside/leaving a noisy place to have a cigarette?

If you're like me, you'll enjoy stepping outside of a party/pub to have a cigarette now and again, just to get away from the noise or have some privacy for a few minutes. Any advice or experience from others on how they substituted this when quitting smoking?

On day 10. Today was weird, but doing okay.

No smokes starting on a Saturday morning before a vacation. Vacation flew by with not even a thought. After work today felt awkward, and actually considered buying a pack and having 'just one'. It's passing... Sort of. I try to drink beer through cravings, but not so much that I get stupid enough to buy a pack or bum one. 

I started using a pedometer on my iphone and riding my bike regularly which is kind of the best. Also, always have headphones so I can listen to music during walks to/from the subway.

So far so good... Stoked to almost be in double digit days. Oh and holy crap the city smells amazing!

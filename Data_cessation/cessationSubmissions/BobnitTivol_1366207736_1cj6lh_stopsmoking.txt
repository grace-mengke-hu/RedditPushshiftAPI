Passed 8 places to buy smokes on my way into work this morning.

Had last cig' at about 4:30pm yesterday. Have been building up to this for a long time (years). A bit tetchy but not too bad so far. I hope no customers, vendors or co-workers piss me off today. This writing about thing might actually help, who knew! I'm not normally a touchy feely sort of person.

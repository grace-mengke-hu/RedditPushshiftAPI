I’m afraid of giving up something so familiar to me

I’m turning 30 this week and have been smoking for about 12 years. I know how awful it is and how much better my life will be once I quit, but I have this weird sadness of giving up something I enjoy so much. I love the intimate conversations and conversations that come up when going outside to smoke with a small circle. It’s such a part of who I am, and I want to quit, but it also makes me a little sad. I know how dumb that sounds, but I needed to get it out there.

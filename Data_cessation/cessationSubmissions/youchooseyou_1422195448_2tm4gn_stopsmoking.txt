Day 11 so far so good

I decided to quit for the New Year but failed. I finally made the decision to go cold turkey starting Jan 15th and I'm smoke free until now and counting despite being surrounded by people who still do. It's an everyday struggle and I take it one craving at a time.. divert myself by reading, drinking water, deep breathing, jumping up and down, and I feel so fortunate for stumbling on to sites such as this one. Thank you for the uplifting words of encouragement and support from previous posts. Having people who cheer you on really do help, virtual or not.

Quit via Vaping?

I quit smoking 2 days ago with nicotine gum but find it is making my jaw sore. I tried the nicotine lozenges and they made me sick. I also vape now and then but always used no nicotine juice. Now I am wondering if using nicotine juice in my vape might be the way to go. Any one have experience with this? Thanks in advance.

No tobacco challenge for 1 month.

I started smoking in Nov. 2016, an average of 20-25 fags a day. Day before yesterday i was talking to a friend about how i was trying to cut down with the help of nicotine chewing gum and we had a discussion about why i smoked etc. I said to him that i liked the act of smoking and even if i didn't smoke like crazy someday, I'd still have an occasional cig. He rebutted by saying that I have never tried to quit smoking and should try to do the same for a month at least and see if I would feel the same way about cigs. This is not easy and at the very same time feels like a piece of cake. I've been seriously depressed and my mind is foggy and Ive had some really violent dreams which have left me a broken man. I will regardless see this challenge through. Just want to know what smokers like me trying to quit/cut down or smokers who have issues with the idea of smoking but still enjoy it feel about this or have been through similar predicament. I cant talk about this shit with other people that i know in real life simply because i dont want to. i want to know what strangers think. Please feel free to share your insight/thoughts on this bs. Your comments will be appreciated. Thank you :-)

Horrible shortness of breath. Is it normal??

Ever since I quit I noticed I was breathing fuller, deeper breaths and it's been great. But then suddenly, I spent all of yesterday feeling like I couldn't fill my lungs with air properly. I haven't had a cold or flu like symptoms since I quit, but I'd never felt this horrible feeling - like I needed to yawn very forcibly to feel I was breathing properly - not even while still smoking heavily. Do you know if this is normal?

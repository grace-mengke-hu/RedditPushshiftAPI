T-Minus 6 days to Quit Date...

Here we are again, approaching a new year with another opportunity for new year resolutions. Last year, I quit Starbucks. It has been 360 days that I have not been to or in a Starbucks for any reason what-so-ever. As a previous, 5 out of 7 days a week visitor who spent an average of $40 a week on coffee and high calorie treats, I'm totally proud. Granted, instead of Starbucks I go to 7-11 for my coffee now, but hey it's cheaper.

But now we are approaching 2016. 16 being my favorite number my whole life, I feel a magical power being granted to me this new year, where I will have the power to do whatever I want to make myself a better person. Will power has nothing on your favorite number.

So, how do I choose to use this power? To stop doing the one thing I have been doing everyday for the last 20 years. QUIT SMOKING CIGARETTES.

And I am scared as fuck. This will be at least the 4th time in 20 years that I have seriously quit smoking. "3rd times a charm" was two too many quits ago. I am struggling with making sure I am in the right mindset for it, fearing that if my motivation ducks aren't in a row in the next 6 days, then I am screwed and won't make it out of the first 24 hours. So, here I am...reaching out to The Internets for help, support, and kind words to help me in my fight. In return, I pledge to support others when they need help, and post to you - good or bad - as I make this journey.

So far, I have the following lined up to aid me in a successful quit:
-Chantix, started last night.
-Quit date, the magical 1/1/16 date in sight.
-Knowledge of past quits, what to do when to make sure that I stay quit. ie. what to do with my hands, what to do with my mind, what to do with the excess stressful energy.
-Kick off quit-smoking celebration of a Venti Carmel Macchiato from Starbucks. ;)

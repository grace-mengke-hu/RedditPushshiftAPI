5 months smoke-free and a quick message for the guys that are trying to quit right now

I stopped smoking 5 months ago and then I quit alcohol 3 months-ish later. Before I quit those two addictions, I used to lay at home and watch movies/play games all day, not exercise, no job. Pretty much useless besides doing house chores. 

My head has never been so clear since I quit cigarettes. It has definitely helped with my crippling anxiety/stress and I have become MUCH more confident. Skin cleared up and is starting to look like a babys bumcheek. I don't have to go to bed in complete silence and listen to my wheezing. The amount of fkin' money I spent on just killing myself for a few seconds of relief was embarassing. So people out there, you will suffer a bit, maybe a lot when you start off but the pay off is worth it, in soooo many ways.

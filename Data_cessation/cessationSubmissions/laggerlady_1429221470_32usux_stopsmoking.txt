first time ever!!

Today I mowed my front and back yard and did a bunch of weeding in the garden. Then I poured myself a tall, cold, dark rum and coke and sat out in  the lovely spring sunshine. I DID NOT WANT A CIGARETTE!!!!! After 40 years of smoking, this was the first time that I can remember just sitting and enjoying without needing to light up. I could even smell the fresh cut grass! Just to let all you guys who are just starting up  know that it does get easier. Not everyday and not all the time but today was just a gift. Don't smoke today, its really not worth it and you miss too much of life.

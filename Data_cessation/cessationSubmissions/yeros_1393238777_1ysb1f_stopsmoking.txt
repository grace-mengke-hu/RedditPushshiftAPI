My friends mom has picked up smoking, only when others smoke

So,  recently my friends' mom is seeing someone and he smokes. She used to smoke and has quit on and off for longer periods (years). I don't have a problem with it but her daughter (my friend) does (asthma). She's not picked up smoking but only smokes when he is, which is a bit stupid. Her mom's really cool and i wish her all the good things in life, but this is not necessary. How can i help?

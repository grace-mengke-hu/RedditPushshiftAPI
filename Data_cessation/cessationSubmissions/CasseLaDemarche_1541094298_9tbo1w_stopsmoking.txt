Quit smoking and joint :)

Hi All,

&amp;#x200B;

I've been off smoking analogs since 7 days now - and I feel great, it was not as complicated as it sounds (1 pack Red Mrl smoker for +10 years) 

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is that I smoke 1 or 2 joints mixed with tobacco every evening, I know that's not good and I plan to quit it very soon as well.

&amp;#x200B;

Are those 2 smokes a day will ruin all the benefits from quitting ? I'm sure that it wont totally but can I expect to see further great improvment in my overall health even keeping this bad habit?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks !!

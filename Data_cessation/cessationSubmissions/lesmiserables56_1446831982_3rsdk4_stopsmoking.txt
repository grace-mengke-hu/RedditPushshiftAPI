slipped up yesterday, but made it today!

Had a rough morning. I forgot how hard mornings are when quitting. Getting up with no patch on yet and getting those cravings where it's all you can think of. But I used my e-cig and go through it! Yesterday was my quit date and I slipped up and had two, but today is a new day! Remember guys, never give up even if you slip up. Just start fresh the next day. One day at a time!

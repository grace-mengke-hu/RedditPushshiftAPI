24h in and I feel like I am going to lose my mind

Yesterday (just about 24h ago), was my last cigarette. I cleaned the house of all smoking related products and plan to do as much cleaning/laundry as I can to get the smell out of clothes and other areas tonight.

That said, I want to smoke so badly. it's all I can think about (I have OCD so once an idea gets going, it goes for a long time).  Luckily cleaning can help with my OCD thoughts, so maybe tonight will kill two birds with one stone, but I know that cravings/desires peak a few days after quitting; really afraid if it's this bad one day in, the next couple days may be compelte and total hell.

Any ideas for getting through this first week would be amazingly appreciated.   At the point, the best motivation I have is that I know if I relapse, I get to go through all these again, and quite  frankly, fuck that.

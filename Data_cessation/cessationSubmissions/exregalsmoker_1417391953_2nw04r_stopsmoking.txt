Started smoking again

The cravings were so bad i caved in on friday after doing so well 4 months without one puff. I dont smoke that much tbh only had 15 cigs to this day 4 all day today.I will quit again  thats for sure i can go 8hrs at work without 1 and im hoping to stop again this week either with champix or gum as Arnie would say i'll be back (smoke free) for good this time

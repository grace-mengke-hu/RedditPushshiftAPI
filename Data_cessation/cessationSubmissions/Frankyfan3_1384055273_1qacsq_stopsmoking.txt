Tried a few drags. But, it was a good decision (for me)

Only been quit a couple months & I'm on vacation with a bunch of awesome people, some of which are still smokers.

I've been resisting cravings like a boss but this morning I was way hung over & ran into a person who was smoking "my brand" and was compelled.

It was a really good slip up, though because I only had about 3 drags & then handed it off to another smoker.

I've been glorifying the flavor I thought I missed when getting cravings & **it was so gross!**

It was great to get the affirmation that quitting was & is what I want.

So, that was cool. I just wanted to share. Might not be a good call for everyone, but I'm glad I gave myself a taste of what I thought I was craving to drive home the fact that I'm craving a false memory more than an actual smoke.

Bipolar but made it one month!

1 month down! Incredibly challenging but I feel this really made me stronger, more resilient as a person. I can tackle other goals too now. I have bipolar disorderâ€”from what I understand that makes it even more unlikely that I would quit. Pushing through all of the emotions that come with withdrawal have been intense. But what the hell, here I am!

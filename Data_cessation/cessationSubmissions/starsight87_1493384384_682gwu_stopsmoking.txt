Day 4

So I decided after a few weeks of nicotine replacement that I was ready to take the plunge and get off of everything. It has been 4 days and I am feeling reasonably well at this point.

Some strong cravings, headaches and feeling irritable but feeling like I have a grip on things. I was a smoker for 6 years, about a pack and a half - 3/4 at the end of it. 

I decided to quit because of the loss of my aunt, a lifelong friend and teacher to me. She smokes all her life and after a courageous battle with CPOD she passed away late last year. 

Also, I am 29 years old, not getting any younger and want to focus on my health. Hopefully this group is something that can help and look forward to hearing your stories as well.

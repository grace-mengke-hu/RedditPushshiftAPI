A little over two weeks ago was the last time I smoked. This has been my experience thus far

**A little back story:** I've smoked for the past 12 years or so, about 2 packs every 3 days. Throughout highschool and college I used to buy bags full of 200 smokes from the native reserve for $10. They were really rough, but what I was able to afford.

For the past 7 years I'd been smoking Belmonts which is a more premium brand which have gone from $8 a pack to $13 a pack over the past 7 years.


**How and why I quit:** Basically I got extremely drunk and chainsmoked all night while watching the NHL season opener. We're talking beer during the game, then whiskey, then a couple of bottles of red wine. My SO's birthday was coming up and we had rented a cabin for 8 days up in the Bruce Peninsula in the middle of nowhere. My SO has been wanting me to quit for years, and the gift that I had been negotiating with an antique seller for had fallen through, so I was left empty handed. I woke up the next morning and the smell of my shirt almost made me puke, and I couldn't even think about smoking, this lasted all day. The next day, I was still feeling pretty rough, but was kind of impressed with myself that I didn't smoke all day so I decided to keep it going that day too. By the third day I had decided that for the sake of my girlfriend and my own health I was going to quit. The next day it was time to go to the cottage in the middle of the wilderness and I just didn't bring and smokes with me.

**What I've noticed so far:**

-Not smoking made me constipated. I've never really been constipated before except the other time I tried to quit. I didn't shit for 5 days, it was a doozy when I finally did.

-I was getting headaches for the first couple of days, ibuprofen helped with that though

-Hiking/kayaking was a lot easier, even after just five days of not smoking compared to last July when I was out there

-After 5 days I can actually breathe through my nose all the time now

-After about a week I was smelling stuff again and I could taste more things

-A week in I started dreaming about smoking. I dreamt that I started back up again, and when I woke up I was kind of panicky thinking I had messed up

-I've been over seasoning everything. Everything I've been cooking has been too spicy or salty or garlicy or oniony. I need to tone that down a bit.

-I had some drinks a couple of times and it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. I felt better in the morning than I normally would after a night of drinking.

-I found myself drinking more actually. Throughout the night I would think to myself "Smoke time" and have to internally remind myself that I don't smoke any more. So instead of heading outside for a smoke I would head to the fridge for another beer.

-I'm currently searching for a job and felt better during an interview today because my suit didn't stink like smoke because I wasn't smoking til the very last minute

-After two weeks I'm still much more easily agitated, hopefully that subsides soon.

-I've found that I don't really buy a whole lot. I was spending most of my money after my bills on smokes. It's just sitting there now. I'm going to buy Bayonetta 2 tomorrow.

-Over the past week I've still been coughing stuff up, but for the first time in a decade it hasn't been a gross shade of brown. I've just got a bit of a cold I think, I almost kinda forgot that sick people could cough up phlegm that was white.

**In conclusion**: Giving yourself a massive hangover to induce a cold turkey quit is pretty dumb, I wouldn't suggest it, but it'd worked for me so far. If you can book some time off, I do strongly suggest getting out to nature in the middle of nowhere. I was kind of forced to not smoke because there weren't any stores in a 40km radius of the cottage. I think I'm going to eat a pineapple and try to convince my SO that my spunk probably tastes better now.

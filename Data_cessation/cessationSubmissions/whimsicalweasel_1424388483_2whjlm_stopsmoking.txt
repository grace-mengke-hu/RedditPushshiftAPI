Day 8: this was kind of an accident...

So I didn't actually mean to quit smoking, but here I am on day 8 anyways. The story is that I never smoke around my boyfriend and I spent 4 solid days with him. Then I got sick with a nasty head cold, by the time that cleared up it had been a whole week and I didn't see the point of getting a new pack.  I've been smoking for a decade and I haven't even had any cravings. Oops. Well here is to a new healthier me!

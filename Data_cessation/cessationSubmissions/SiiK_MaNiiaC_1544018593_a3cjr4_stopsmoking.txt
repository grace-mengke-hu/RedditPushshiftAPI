1 day and counting

So I managed not to smoke yesterday at all even after coming home from work which I find it really hard not to do. I had some cravings but this time I told myself there’s no way I was smoking this time. Went for a jog with my dog, went to bed kinda early and I didn’t smoke, feeling much better this morning that I didn’t smoke and promise to keep it up

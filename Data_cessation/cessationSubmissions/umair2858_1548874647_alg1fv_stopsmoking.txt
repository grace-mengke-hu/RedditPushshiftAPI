Smoking dreams

I've recently gave up the dirty habit (been about 5 days know) but last night i had a surreal dream where i was smoking a cigarette i remember feeling so relived but anxious in the dream needless to say, i woke up feeling disgusted and disappointed in myself. Are these dreams normal? And if they are, how do i prevent them from reoccurring?

Only 4 days, yet super proud

So I've tried to quit before, lasted around 3 hours each time before having a cigarette. "Cutting down" I would say, this is progress! I'm not even addicted I just DESERVE a cigarette.. it has been a whole 3 hours after all... 

My mindset has completely changed, I realised that you can't quit for anyone else (girlfriend), you can only quit for yourself, you're the one going through the pain. 

I learned that quitting isn't a process, you're not "in the process of quitting", you either quit or you don't, "quitting" is a middle ground that will lead to failure. Quit. 

Cold turkey is the only thing that's worked for me, it's fucking hard, I haven't slept more than 3 hours a night and I constantly want to kill myself and everyone around me. But it's so fucking worth it. The feeling of pride when that awful craving passes. 

If you fail, good. Use that feeling. When I really decided to quit I lasted two days before I took a cigarette from a friend and I fucking cried after. Accept the feeling of disappointment, you failed. It's the worst feeling in the world and I swear to god I wouldn't wish that on anyone. It's been 4 days since that hiccup and I'll never revisit that place.

I don't know Reddit I think this post was a little ranty, it's my first time drinking after quitting and I think I just had to vent. I've found so much support by reading the posts here, merry Christmas to you all.

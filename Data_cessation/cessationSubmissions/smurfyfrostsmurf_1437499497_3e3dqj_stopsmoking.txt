Smoking as a procrastinator

Quitting has really helped me solve part of my problem. I've always used the "after I smoke a cigarette" excuse to delay what needed to be done.

Quitting also taught me to be more persistent and a better person overall. I use the fact that I quit to drive me to do other things and take initiative.

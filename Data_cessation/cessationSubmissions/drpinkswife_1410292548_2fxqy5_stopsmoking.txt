Ramble

Had to go into London today. Came out of London Liverpool Street station at 13:15. I swear everyone and their brother was out on the streets smoking. It was such a beautiful day and it stunk. And I had to get to an interview for a new job and I was trying to navigate my way and get there without ending up smelling like those poor saps smoking everywhere. It's not called the Big Smoke for nothing! Very happy to be smoke free today!

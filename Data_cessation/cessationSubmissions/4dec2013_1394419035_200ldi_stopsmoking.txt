Remind me. Whats the harm in smoking every one week or so? Shouldn't you reward yourself?

Lungs have self-repairing mechanism, right? And you inhale atleast as much smoke in the city anyways. Why does it has to be quit forever, why can't you just smoke once a week or so to just get it all out of your system? otherwise you keep thinking about how much you miss it and end up spending more time missing it than you would've if you just lit up making the overall time wasted (including reducing your life) far less. Doesn't that make sense?

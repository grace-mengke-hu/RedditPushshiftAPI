Thanks to smoking

Needy Nancy & slutty Susan have been masquerading as triggers & craves. Both of them are part of a failed marriage. I named them to manage feelings. This was before I stopped smoking but I used the same principle to help with quitting. Worked out pretty well. For the past 2 weeks though almost every night & some mornings a cigarette need slams me. Stays just a few seconds but it's a real slam. I shouldn't really complain, those thoughts & needs used to be elephants that sat for a minute or 2 but I should be past this. I awoke this morning with crave/trigger, Susan & Nancy. It occurred to me they are all the same, they feel the same. Not worried that this would jeopardize my quit, it won't, but it makes it quite miserable on a regular basis. 

I put this here for a few reasons. To say some things out loud instead of in my head, to expose triggers & craves and to say I really do think uncovering the things you allow your addiction to deal with makes you a healthier person. There is another thing though. We talk about this addiction monster. I've seen a lot of names. Truth is the power of it comes from us. It's not so much stealthy, deceitful or lizard like as it is that we know ourselves & formulate the best tricks. I do think we have to find better ways of talking to ourselves & our addictions. Susan & Nancy are neither slutty or needy. Maybe now they will leave my quit alone.

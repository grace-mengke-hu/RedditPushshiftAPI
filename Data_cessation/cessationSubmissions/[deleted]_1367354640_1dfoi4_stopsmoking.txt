1 month down!

It's actually been quite easy.  I always heard people say, "When you want to, you will."  I always thought that was bullshit, but I guess they were right.  I've always known I needed to quit, but I finally wanted to, or wasn't afraid to.  Smoking becomes ingrained in your life which makes it scary to quit.

I've pretty much been cold turkey, though a couple weeks before I stopped I was smoking a pipe.  That cut down my cigs quite a bit, so I don't know if that has anything to do with how easy it's been.  "Easing into it" if you will.  Regular old sugarless gum helped with some cravings.

The day I stopped, I had an extension ladder slide out from under me which sent me to the ER.  Had to get 6 stitches in my hand, which rendered it pretty much useless for a while.  I just healed up to the point where I could get normal use out of it, so I'm thinking that it's going to be even easier going now.  I didn't smoke that first day, and I'd have to say it was the worst by far.  After that I knew I could make it.

Observations thus far:

**Triggers:**  My usual triggers aren't nearly as strong this time.  Coffee isn't really a trigger for me anymore, though I am drinking way more of it.  Alcohol is still a bit of a trigger, but I don't really obsess over smoking, it just feels like I'm a bit closer to breaking.  I've gotten quite sloshed and ended up at strip clubs and casinos, and I've still held strong.  So, I haven't caved even when I've been beyond the point of losing my inhibitions.  I did get quite a bit of practice in at home, though. :)  After meals.  Still a big one, but it seems to be fading.  I've noticed that it helps if I don't sit around, and get up immediately (I mean immediately) after I finish a meal.  I jump right on those dishes, and then take a walk.

**Appetite:**  Dear lord, am I a fat pig.  I've never had this much of an appetite, even before I was a smoker.  I've always had no problems putting the fork down when I was full, but it seems I don't get full now.  I've put on 5 lbs, which isn't terrible, but I've got to stop.  Boredom may have something to do with that.  It also doesn't help that for the first few weeks I basically ate take-out every night due to not being able to really cook or wash dishes.  Once you get into that routine it's hard to get out.  Luckily, it's getting warmer and I always eat less and drink more water when it's warmer.  Honestly I don't really care about all this.  I'm not smoking.  That's all that maters right now.

**Cravings:**  Cravings aren't as intense this time around.  They come and go pretty quickly, where as previous attempts had me obsessing over smoking, or rather my inability to smoke.  Now I just get a quick feeling that something is missing, or that I should be doing something.  It seems to fade just as fast as it comes in.

**Health:**  I've noticed it has gotten a bit easier to breathe.  I'm still coughing a little (cleaning out) so hopefully it will continue to get better.  I haven't been exercising very much minus some walking around, but I'm ready to get started.  Hopefully by my next update I'll have good news on that front.  Food is delicious.  Damn is food delicious.  It smells good, too.  I smell good.  I always hated the smell on me.  I've noticed a lot more girls smiling my way these days as well (that could totally be mental, though).

**Money:**  Cha-ching!  $150 saved.  Nuff said.

I hope this helps some people out there.  My experience has been unusual, even for me.  I smoked for 15 years, and I had stopped 3 or 4 times previously, but I would barely make it a week.  That was with patches.  I could say it was because I eased off cigarettes with the pipe, but I dropped them both the same day, and I had tried doing the same with e-cigs before.

I work from home, so I haven't really been around it much at all.  I haven't hung out with my smoking friends at all.  That may have helped.  It was always hardest for me both at work, and at the bar with friends.  If you have to disappoint friends, I'd say do it.  Explain to them that you aren't smoking anymore, and don't want to be around it for a while.  Reading this sub has also helped big time, so I thank you all!


**TL;DR:**  That wasn't so hard.

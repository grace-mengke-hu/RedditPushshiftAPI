I think I'm done here...

Farewell my fellow quitters. It's been a hell of a journey. I did not think I'd ever quit smoking, I kid myself and thought I don't *want* to quit smoking, or worse I don't need to quit smoking.

Yet here we are, 73 days in and not a single puff or craving or a memory of life before I quit. I watch my friends smoking when we party and I don't even remember I used to be one of that group. I watch random strangers on the streets, and I pity them. I have bugged and pestered friends and family and have been able to successfully bring them aboard our merry band of quitters. I have begun running and just finished a C25K plan and successfully started a journey of fitness.

I don't want to unsubscribe from the group. I want to stay here and support others who are new, like I was supported when I was. Although I haven't participated much in the discussions, I have spent so much time reading everything here that I feel I know many people personally. 

And yet, the only reminder about smoking I routinely get is from this community. I'm not sure I want to be tested that way. There are others who have been here for years and keep supporting new members and write many an inspirational post on important milestones. I am not one of them. I am not as strong as they are.

This community has been the single biggest support group I have had and I cannot thank you all enough. Just reading your stories and words of encouragement every day and checking the group every hour was how I kept sane when I began. Knowing that I wasn't alone on this journey made the path a little easier to tread.

Fuck cigarettes and fuck nicotine. I'm rid of them and I hope I'll stay away for life.

To the people who are beginning now, I congratulate you on your decision and wish you all the best. This has been the greatest place on reddit for many a month for me, but now is the time to move on.

Good bye and good luck

I just hit the 7 day mark! I'm so bloody proud of myself.

YES, I've done it. 7 days without a cigarette at all. I feel freaking wonderful. My taste and smell are coming back I do believe.

On top of this, for the people who are trying to quit right now. Buy a couple of e-cigarettes without nicotine! They're fantastic, and the cravings will ease a lot. :)

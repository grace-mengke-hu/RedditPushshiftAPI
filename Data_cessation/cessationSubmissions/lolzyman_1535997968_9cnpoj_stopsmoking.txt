Six months in and feel like life is boring without smokes

I try to convince myself that its all in my head. I know taking up smoking again will not make much of a difference but I cant shake off the feeling. I am not sure why I'm even making this post, I guess I just need to tell someone and this seems like the right place.

Every occasion seems boring without smoking. Even the weekend parties that I used to love don't excite me anymore. When I quit smoking I imagined six months would be completely opposite of how it is right now.

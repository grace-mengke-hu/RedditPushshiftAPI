Day 1: I have to make this work (long)

Hello everyone, 

Today is the day. No more excuses. I have spent years telling myself every night before bed I will quit tomorrow, but never have. I'm 32 and started smoking when I was 14. I always said I would never smoke cigarettes, but boy was I wrong. 

The first thing I smoked was marijuana and then someone told me if you want to make sure you don't get caught smoke a cigarette after. Being young and dumb, I listened and bought a pack about a week later and have everyday since. Both have continued for the last 18 years. I know people think weed isn't addictive, but I beg to differ. I think it depends how much you smoke, and I've smoked a lot. Yeah I don't get the shakes, but if I haven't smoke marijuana then normally by my second bite of food I have to throw up before I can even swallow it and feel stuffed. I'm tired of smoking controlling my life, and destroying my bank account. 

I was burned as a kid and was on a lot of morphine from 11-16 because of surgeries. Smoking was my escape to clear my mind. Doesn't make it right and not looking to make excuses, but it is what it is. I doubt anybody will read this, but I had to get it off my chest. 

I said tomorrow yesterday! I have to pull this off for my family and I.

Relapse after 2 months

Hi all. I'm new here,  I browsed through the topics some time ago but never posted anything, until now obviously. 

So anyway, after 2 months of not smoking a relapsed 7 or 8 days ago and I'm almost back to where I were. I was out with friends, got drunk, had one, then two, then 5.. And I'm at probably 10 a day now..  I just decided to try and quit again, for real. No telling myself I'll quit but I won't stuff. I remind myself of why I quit in the first place, and remember that great feeling of having a clear lungs and a clear mind. It's really an awesome feeling, one I've forgot about. So it makes me sad to accept the fact I'm back to day one. I'm resetting my quit smoking app and trying anew. 

That's why I'm writing this. In hopes I'll come here every day or so, read my post, read the other posts and remind myself of why I should quit for good! 

To all of you, I wish you luck in staying smoke free! :)

Finished reading EASYWAY

I haven't smoked since finishing that book, It's only been 24 hours but it's incredible how effective it worked. I am currently rereading it and plan on rereading it for at least 3 weeks. (Might be excessive) I feel like this book is honestly a very powerful tool in helping me quit. Just an update: This is the longest I have gone without a cigarette in 3 years and It's incredible how little I feel any withdrawal pangs. I recommend this book to every smoker.

My personal tip to everybody who quit smoking

I quit smoking for like 2 weeks now, and I must say I haven't really been thinking about cigarettes. 

Why?

I just act like they don't exist anymore, I act like they don't sell them anymore like theyre totally banned from my country. Like they are nowhere to be found... Like theyve dissapeared the very next day and Im forced to replace my cigs with something else.

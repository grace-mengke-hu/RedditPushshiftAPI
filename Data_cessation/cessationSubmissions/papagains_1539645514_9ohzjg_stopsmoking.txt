I'm using my environment as an excuse

To give you some details..I'm a 24 years old and have been smoking a pack a day since 18. I was raised by a single mother who is a very heavy smoker (I don't blame her) so I grew up with it all my life. Seeing the negative effects smoking has first hand, I promised myself I wouldn't have the same addiction. Lo and behold, here I am. 

There have been some exceptions to my addiction, I held to my new promise that I would never smoke in a car or house because I knew the consequences. At a few of my previous jobs, I was only smoking half of a pack at most each day since my opportunities were limited. (Still didn't quit though)

Fast forward to my current job; My mom had a great deal of success in starting her own company and eventually hired my brother and I to work for her. This is absolutely great! Except for the heavy smoking. 

We have a seperate building we use as an office, and all of the work we do is done on the computer. Smoking inside buildings is something i've dealt with my entire life so I should be able to quit smoking and deal with it. But I can't...half of the cigarettes we light burn half smoked in the ash tray because we light them, take a few drags and then set it down to continue working. It's a non smokers nightmare. I've tried to quit while working here before but I made it absolute hell for my family and it turned into a huge fight i'd prefer to not have again.

Do you have any suggestions? Quitting my job isn't one unfortunately.

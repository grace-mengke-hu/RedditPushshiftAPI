Picking up smoking is my biggest regret in life .

I’m 2 months and 6 days free of smoking. It’s been really hard lately , all I seem to think about is going out to buy a pack. I know if I did I would have a lot of stress and anxiety about failing and also how I’m back to killing myself with each puff so now I just feel stuck and miserable . Miserable I’m not smoking , knowing I’ll be still be miserable if I start up again. I feel like I’m doomed to be stressed about smoking or the lack thereof for the rest of my life and I feel really pouty about it this past week.

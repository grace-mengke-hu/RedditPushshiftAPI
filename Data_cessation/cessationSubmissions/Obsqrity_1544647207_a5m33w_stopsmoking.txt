2019 here we go!

So I've had this in my head for a long time and it's time for me to quit smoking cigarettes! I'm going to quit coming 2019. It's the most disgusting habit I've ever picked up. The good thing is my company offers a year long program that if I quit and pass the random nicotine testing they pay me $500! So I think it's a pretty sweet deal. Just signed up today, wish me luck!

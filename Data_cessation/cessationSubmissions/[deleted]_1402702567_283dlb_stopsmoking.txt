Day 8... never realized how crappy Taco Bell food actually is

Some of the affects I am starting to notice are that food is tasting more vibrant. As such, when I made my Taco Bell run today... man... I forgot why I liked that crap in the first place! lol. But anyway, taste is just one of the long term rewards I am experiencing from quitting along with better breathing as well as scent. These things I had to my list for quitting.

Words don't come easy. Rejecting Cravings Hurts Mentally.

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrrrrggggggggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!

My business partner had a really gentle vapestick, it was lady designed, unsmoky and she quit before me on the New Years EVE. It broke yesterday and today I was in the car and she used her emergency vaper..... fuck my old boots, I felt my brain twitch to the nicotine going in as the clouds of smoke from this 1990's dried ice machine started spewing out. I have just dealt with four hours of proper nicotine cravings as a result of accidentally deep enhaling this shite. I was so close to letting my bastard subconscious win I am angry at myself like hell!

S'ok tho I won:) Fuck you subconscious drug addled fucker: I WON!

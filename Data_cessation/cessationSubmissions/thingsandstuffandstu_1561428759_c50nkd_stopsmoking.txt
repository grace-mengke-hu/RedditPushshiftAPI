Anyone else using vape pens to help quit? If so, are you having the same feels as I am...?

I have a small one with replaceable cartridges so I'm not having to refill or change coils and what not, so it's a pretty easy system. I'm at 12 days without a cigarette, which is GREAT - this has been the longest time without in over 15 years. I am REALLY FEELING this quit! Because the pen gives you the same "resistance" feeling of pulling on a cigarette while also giving you nicotine, I seriously have not had ONE craving for a real smoke since I quit. My lung capacity is growing, I'm finally getting some better sleep after the first week or so, and I'm feeling energy levels returning. The company is reputable, so I know what the ingredients are, and trust that it's all on the up and up. It's also drastically cheaper, which is also great... but I *still* have this nagging voice in the back of my head - "Yes, you've quit smoking cigarettes, BUT you're still smoking SOMETHING and are also still addicted to nicotine," which is kinda jamming the good vibes that I feel I should be having about The Big Quit. 

I've mentioned this to some of my friends (who are all non-smokers, and some of whom have researched vaping / quitting as a way to help support me), and they're all "NO WHAT, you're crazy! The fact that you've quit smoking is all that matters, vape away."

Is anyone else going through the same thing...? I'm torn between being sooooo happy about being an official non-cigarette-smoker, but I know this is all tied to me vaping. Looking into studies on straight nicotine, yes, it's almost as hard to quit as heroin, but on its own is not cancer-causing or excessively harmful. I'm confused about my feelings about this quit, but am still 100% committed to never puffing a CIGARETTE again...!

Is anyone else feeling kinda similar...?

Well, here we are.

I don't have very much to say or any concrete advice. Only thing I know is that time went by stupid fast.

However, one day I was getting sick of waking up with a throat made of concrete and other shit. When you think about it, you're just inhaling poison, literally, what the hell.

One thing that seemed to work for me was reading The easy way to stop smoking by Allen Carr. Take what you want from it.

[this](http://imgur.com/6uD0UsC) is what I've saved in two years. 

Thanks guys and stop that shit.

Edit: Feel free to ask me any questions.

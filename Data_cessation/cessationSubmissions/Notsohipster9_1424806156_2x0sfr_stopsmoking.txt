Almost caught fire...first time poster

I was driving up the NY Thruway the other night at around 70 mph smoking a cig and without thinking I just threw the butt (still lit) out the window. It went out the window and came right back and while trying to keep the car straight I trid putting out the butt in my car. Alas I couldn't find it, and figured I had put it out.

About 30 seconds later I see smok start rising out of my car, and there is no shouldr for me to pull over to. I keep searching high and low while holding on to the wheel but I still smelt the burning of something in my car. Finally a shoulder opens up and I get out of the car and check everywhere in my car, but I couldn't find anything. I then noticed the car wasn't smoking anymore, I was. So I pat myself down but couldn't find anything. Finally I throw my hood up and out falls the butt. It burnt a hole through my hoodie and nicked part of my hair.

This scared me half to death in all honesty, just because I NEEDED this little fix of a cigarette. I need to quit, I Just need to. Is it worth potentially causing an accident while im making a simple drive, or even the further health risks? No it's not. Any suggestions would be amazing

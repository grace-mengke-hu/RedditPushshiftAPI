Quit 13 months ago, still severe stomach bloating and pain

I won't give up and start again, I just want to know does anyone have any solution to this? Searched everywhere, nobody seems to have an answer other than "It should pass", just questions from ex smokers with the same problem.  
I can't even do abs exercises, because then my stomach gets tight and bloating starts pushing against my spine, so it hurts even more.  


Most of people say "I started smoking again, and my stomach is OK now", but I really don't wanna do that.

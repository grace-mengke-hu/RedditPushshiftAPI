The things about smoking that remind me why I’m quitting.

- That gross feeling when I’ve had too many cigarettes in a row.

- How all my clothes reek after a cigarette and how it smells 100 times worse to everyone around me who doesn’t smoke.

- The shame when I’m out with a group of friends who don’t smoke and I’m the only one who has to constantly leave to go outside and smoke.

- How I can’t walk up one flight of stairs without heaving and wheezing after.

- The bad breath that smoking gives me; no matter how many times I use mouthwash and pop gum it’s useless against cigarette breath.

- The $300 wasted every month on cigarettes instead of being saved for the future or used to treat myself to something I’ve always wanted but couldn’t because of smoking cutting my budget. 

- The alarming fact that I can’t even remember who I was before I started smoking.

And many more...

There’s also about 100 reasons why I COULD continue smoking but they’re just fake, selfish reasons I make up in order to justify a disgusting addiction. As difficult as this journey will be, I’ve got to remind myself of the few things I hate about smoking that trump the 100 things I love about smoking. With that thought, I’m throwing out my last cigarette and I’m ready to become the person I was before smoking.

Quit smoking two weeks ago but having emotional issues

Hey guys,  
 I have been on this subreddit for a few months now and the testimonies ib here have helped me quit so thank you. But even two weeks after quitting I am still having random anger fits and I'd straining my relationship with my girlfriend. How do I overcome this and think rationally like I did when I smoked?

Do any of you only smoke when you drink or do drugs?

Just kind of curious.  Every time I go out on the weekend and drink I smoke throughout the night.  Now the amount I smoke depends on the group of people I am with.  I have some friends that don't touch cigs, then I have a group that smokes all night.  I love cigs when drinking (not trying to trigger anyone) but let's say I go out Saturday and have cigs leftover Sunday and throughout the week.  I don't crave a cig at all when sober.  I'll be sitting around home bored and I just don't get a craving like I do when alcohol is involved.  There will be times where I'll go two weeks without drinking and don't smoke a cig one time in that duration but the next time I drink I get that urge again.  Was just wondering if anyone else is like me in this situation.

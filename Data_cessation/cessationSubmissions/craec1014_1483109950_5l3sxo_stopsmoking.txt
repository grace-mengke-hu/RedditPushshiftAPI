Day 7

At the end of today it will have been a week since I've smoked my last cig. I quit cold turkey, but last night I hit an e cig like twice (it had a very low nicotine dosage)... but regardless I'm kind of feeling like I've messed up by even doing that.

So far, it's been pretty miserable...like each day my cravings get worse and worse and I feel very anxious. I feel like my breathing has gotten worse and I have been experiencing chest tightness and coughing. Yesterday was particularly hard... but I hung out with my friends who are smokers and was drinking so maybe that is why it was so difficult. I don't have as much trouble when I'm just at home or spending time with non-smokers. Maybe I need to take a hiatus from drinking and hanging out with my smoker friends until I get used to and feel more confidant about being a non-smoker. Hopefully this will all get easier with time. 

People who have been smoke free for awhile- does it ever get easier or is smoking still something that you think about all the time??? If so, any words of encouragement or advice on how to deal with the anxiety and stress of feeling like you "need" a smoke?

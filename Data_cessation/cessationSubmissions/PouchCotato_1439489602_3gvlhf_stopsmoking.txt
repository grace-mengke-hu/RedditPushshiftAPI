I am a non-smoker

I don't feel like smoking anymore but I can't stop reading this sub-reddit either. Gives me some sort of comfort going through all the posts in here. 

I am going strong but I just wanted to see my own post. Last time I slipped because of over confidence ("I've done it for so long I can probably have one and not get hooked").

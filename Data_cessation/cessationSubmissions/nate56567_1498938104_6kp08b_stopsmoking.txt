How long will I be coughing up black mucus?

So I switched to an e-cig about a month and a half ago, I've been coughing black stuff up daily. It seems like my lungs are doing a good job cleaning themselves up, judging by the stuff I'm coughing up. It seems to have died down last week but the last few days it's back to the normal amount. 

How long should I expect to be coughing black mucus up before I should start to consider if it is from a lung infection or a dusty home?

I have never coughed up blood or had coughing fits and I haven't had any chest pain. It's usually dark grey but every once in a while it's brownish.

My girlfriend always gets bad allergies when she comes to my house but I'm 99% sure she's never coughed up any dark mucus, she would tell me if she had. 

Also, slightly off topic, do e-cigs harm the cilia in the lungs? I've read the it's the nicotine that paralyzes it but that seems like misinformation to me. I feel like my cilia is deffinitly healing after switching to the e-cig because when I smoked I did not (as far as I recall) cough the dark stuff up. I'm pretty sure that they've proven that nicotine by itself is no worse than caffeine, but correct me if I am wrong.

Thanks!

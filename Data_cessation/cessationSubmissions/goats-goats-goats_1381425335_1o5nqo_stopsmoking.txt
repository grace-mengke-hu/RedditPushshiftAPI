Struggling to quit when most of my friends are smokers. Any suggestions?

I have had the same best friends since I was three years old, I am now 25, and we are still inseparable. We have done everything together, including starting to smoke in high school. While away at University I was able to kick the habit (more or less). Sadly upon returning from University the more or less became more, much more. The vast majority of my friends smoke with no desire to quit. With many failed attempts under their belts (and my own) I see this venture being something I do on my own.  What does reddit have to say about dealing with the temptation of smoking when often surrounded by others who do? I have never used aids to quit like the gum, e-cigarettes or the patch. Maybe this might be helpful?

As a girl who loves her beer and coffee, cigarets have always been their accompaniment. Does anyone have any tricks or strategies for enjoying my favourite beverages without giving into the cravings?

NRT and Nausea

Not too far on my journey but I seem to be responding badly to...something. I'm  using the patch to gradually lower my nicotine, but all day today I've felt nauseous. It was something I noticed yesterday once or twice but it wasn't bad so I took some tums and went back to work. Today I cut out at lunch because even the smell of food makes me gag. Is this normal, with the patch or just when dropping nicotine content in general?

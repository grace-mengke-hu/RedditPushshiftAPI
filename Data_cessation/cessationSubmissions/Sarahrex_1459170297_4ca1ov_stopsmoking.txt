Day 24, no ciggies

 This time feels a little different. I think what's different is that I made decision not to smoke. In the past it's felt like I was depriving myself of smoking and was jealous of other smokers.  Almost like I was waiting to cave in.  Waiting for something bad enough to happen where I felt like I deserved it.  I found that the strongest edges I've had have been when I was feeling self-destructive.  it is taking a mental shift for me to realize that I deserve to be healthy and proud of my actions. For a while there I thought smoking defined me.  I think I am finding the middle ground between the crazy partier and the healthy Yogi.  Not smoking eating healthy and drinking lots of water feels more genuine and my thoughts are not constantly on how we can pathetic I am but rather how amazing I am for taking care of myself.  Things that I've worked for me I depraving, drinking a ton of water, rewarding myself with something every week I don't smoke, and journaling about the thoughts in my head when I think I want to smoke. It is helped her mind myself the cravings are not a command and the last that I feed the soldiers telling me to smoke my mind the weaker they become.

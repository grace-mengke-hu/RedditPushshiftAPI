Mission help needed!

One of my missions is to state why I like to smoke and research why they are bad for me. One of my reasons for smoking is it's the only time I get a break from work. If I don't smoke after a service I have to load the vans back up while everyone else smokes and takes ten minutes... otherwise I get lunch and that's it all day because it's so busy. Any ideas on how to make this bad reason? I'm paid to the minute so loading the vans ten minutes slower isn't a bad thing!

6 months wow i did it random thoughts and benefits

Thanks for the help in the beginning.  The pain has mostly gone away and the mucus and wet lungs.  And i quit drinking beer and 1/2 sugar.   Feel so much better.   Many worried about my alcohol abuse but it helped me to stay drunk for first 3 months.  Luckily since the pain stopped and i am calmer it all seems to have worked out.  I havent drank more than one beer in a month.  Im not quitting completely just not drinking a 12 pack a night.   Anyways it works it is possible there is light.  A painful journey but one we must take.  Also about sex.  It has gotten so much better.  I remember at one month when the blood was flowing down there again.   Wow now it feels like i grew 2 inches and i can feel every muscle of my wifes vagina.  Amazing sex and prolonged intense orgasms make quitting ciggarettes so worth it.  It may be the best benifit thus far. Thanks and good luck peoples!

What day of the week did you stop?

A new study based on google searches suggests Monday is a popular day to at least show interest in quitting. News article [here](http://www.ctvnews.ca/health/quitting-smoking-it-s-probably-monday-1.1518990).

Fwiw, I quit on a Saturday of a long weekend (I had Monday, day 3 off). My last cigarette was extinguished at 10 am Saturday morning and it tasted like shit.

What about you?

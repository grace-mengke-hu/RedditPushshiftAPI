Started the quitting today, seriously this time. Is it normal that quitting makes you sort of manic?

After messing around for the last month, always telling everybody that I'll be done with smoking after school ends, I finally stopped finding arbitrary dates in the future and went with the simple "now".

You know what's weird? I sort of enjoy quitting, in a way. It does something to my neurotransmitters: I always get super hyped up for the first day or two, maybe a bit easy to stress out, but it feels like I'm more productive and think way faster, maybe even better. Emotions are more intense, too.

I have not been diagnosed with any mental disease and the effect is mostly reproducible.

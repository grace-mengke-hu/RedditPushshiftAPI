End of day three and coughing my lungs out

Anyone have suggestions to subdue the cough that comes with quitting? I'm at the end of day three and all day I am violently coughing. I work at Starbucks and am seeing someone that I don't want to cough in the face of if I want to kiss him (he is extremely supportive and I would not have gotten so far without his support). Any tips? Like tea or something? Or do I just have to wait it out and smile apologetically to customers after coughing fits?

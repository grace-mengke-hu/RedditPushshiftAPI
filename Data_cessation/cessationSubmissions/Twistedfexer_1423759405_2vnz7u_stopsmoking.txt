Quit smoking yesterday morning, looking for tips/advice!

Have been smoking for 9 years, heavily at some points and yesterday morning I finally made the decision to better my life by ditching this nasty habit. 

What I am asking is what are some things to help get your mind off smoking in general, I am not a fan of the whole E-cig or nicotine gum etc,
Any ideas would be greatly appreciated as I feel like I am going insane..

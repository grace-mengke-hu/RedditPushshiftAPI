I’m the one who bought a pack but didn’t smoke the other day. Well... that didn’t last. Need support.

The other day, I made a post about buying a pack during a stressful week. A kind coworker helped talk me out of that craving. But a few days later, the cravings came back just as hard and didn’t go away. I caved. I’m posting here because I’m feeling pretty down on myself. 2.5 years, resetting to zero. I need support to pick back up on my quitting journey after this setback. 

Moral of the story: don’t buy that pack! It’s so much harder to resist once they’re in reach.

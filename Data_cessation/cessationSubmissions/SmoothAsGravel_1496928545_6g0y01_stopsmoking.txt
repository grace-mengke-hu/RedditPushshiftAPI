I'm quitting again and this time for good.

After more countless attempts I'm going again. This time I'm doing it for myself, my body, mental health and future. I have no reason to be smoking I've proved to myself there isn't a single thing I need cigarettes for in my countless attempts. Now I only have one challenge the addiction. The little voice inside of my head in going to kill it forever. No more just one more cigarette. No more quit tomorrow or after this rough patch I know it not gonna do anything so here I go and wish me luck :)

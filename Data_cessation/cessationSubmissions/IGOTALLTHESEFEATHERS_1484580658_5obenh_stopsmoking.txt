After 91 days I smoked

And I feel so bad this morning. I stink and I have a massive headache. I have been through a very tough time lately (a miscarriage, dog got hit by a car while I was on a short trip) and last night I learned me and my husband are going to have to move from a family friendly 3 bedroom house to a single room in a small house. This means delaying starting a family again. I regret smoking so much, it didn't solve any of my problems and just made me feel even more like shit. Thanks for letting me vent.

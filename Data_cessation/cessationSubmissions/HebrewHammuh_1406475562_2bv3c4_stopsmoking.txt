Any tips on quitting when EVERYONE in your life smokes?

I quit once, out of highschool, when I joined the Army. It was all good, and I didn't even care about it any more until I got to my first unit, and almost everyone smoked. I started up again.

Now, three years later, I'm fucking sick of this shit. It's expensive, it's harmful, my girlfriend hates it, and god dammit I don't want this anymore. My question to you guys is this: how do you deal with constantly being around smokers, and cigarettes?

Tips?

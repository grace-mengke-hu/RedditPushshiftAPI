4th day and having a hard tim

4th day in and I'm having a bad day. Yesterday was much better, went running and already noticed a huge difference. Today ever since I woke up all I want to do is buy a pack and a bottle of whine and empty them both tonight! It would feel so great!! But I will also have to start again... ğŸ˜®ğŸ˜‘ğŸ˜Ÿ

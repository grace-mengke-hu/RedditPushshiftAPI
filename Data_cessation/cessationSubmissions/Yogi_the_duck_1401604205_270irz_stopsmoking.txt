So it's day 3 again

I have a severe case of strep throat. I feel like shit. I can't swallow anything. I can't sleep. I can't eat. I can't drink. 

But I caught myself reaching for my pack today. 

This shit is fucking scary guys. I want out. I want this to be done. 

I'm on mobile but I'm sure my old flair is still on here. Don't be fooled.

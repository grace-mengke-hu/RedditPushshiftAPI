5 days without a smoke. I finally feel ready to abandon this awful habit forever.

Made it to the 5 day mark today. Cravings are getting easier to mitigate. Been smoking for the past 5 years (since age 14). Prior to this quit attempt, I'd been smoking 15-20 cigs a day, sometimes even more.

I feel so ready. I feel physically better now than I did last week. But I know I'll have to remain vigilant for the rest of my life. This is such a strong and insidious addiction, innocent slip-ups years down the line can pull you right back in. I quit for ~6 months in 2012-13, and casual bumming off of friends quickly took me off the wagon. And here I am, 2+ years later, starting over with my quit attempt. I'm far more addicted now than ever, but ending my addiction to nicotine means so much to me.

Anyways, here's to everyone's success! It's so freaking hard to quit, but seeing as I've just made it more than I've gone w/o nicotine in over a year, I can't let all this effort go to waste.

Stay strong everyone!

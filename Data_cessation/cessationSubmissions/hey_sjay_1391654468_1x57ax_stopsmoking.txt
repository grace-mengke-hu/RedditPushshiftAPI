Today's finally the day.

I've been talking about quitting so much that my boyfriend no longer believes me when I say it.  I've never been a really heavy smoker, like a pack every 3-4 days, but I'm tired of the way it makes me smell.  I'm tired of the way that it makes me feel.  I'm tired of my bathroom smelling like a cheap motel room because it's been cold, so I've been sitting in there to smoke.  I'm done.  Today is finally the day.

I just got out of the shower, so I smell great.  I'm about to wash my jacket so it won't smell anymore.  It's going to be wonderful not smelling like this.  Not being a slave anymore.

I had my last one on the way home from work, almost 4 hours ago.  It's nice to see that others quit today as well.  I like knowing that I'm not in this alone.

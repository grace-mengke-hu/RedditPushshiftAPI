Anyone else deal with this?

I'm in the process of quitting gradually now, and I don't think it's working. I'm vaping and reducing real cigs - which went well for some time until it didn't. 

The reason I don't solely vape is this: I did if for 2 days and got emotional. This got me thinking about the last time I quit: I had been clean for 9 months, and all that time I felt horrible. I loved that I didn't smoke, it was easy not to smoke. But I was depressed. I have had bad days or weeks all my life, but these 9 months I was a mess all the time.

I started dealing with my problems - ADD, insecurity, overthinking - and I got better. I'm not perfect but my life is good now, for the most part. 

But I got better during the time I started smoking again. I realised that in the period I didn't smoke, I was overemotional and couldn't decide on a single thing. Stuff like which brand of coffee to buy paralized me. I just went home without the coffee, thinking, fuck this, I'll deal with it later. This wasn't like 1 week in. I had been smoke free for months. 

Since then, I've been wanting to quit again. I'm just so afraid the depression will come back. My life and way of thinking are much better now, but I'm convinced that quitting will make me emotional and indecsive again. I mean, it was 9 months. It can't have been effects of withdrawal for 9 months.

All the other reasons to not quit I have eliminated. Miss the habit? Vape at 0 mg. Want to smoke hasj? Use tobacco replacements without nicotine. The quitting itself really wasn't that hard, unless you count one party where someone left their cigs on a table. And I resisted the urge then. So I could really do it. If it weren't for the fact that even a small thing could set off my feeling depressed again.

I'm sure I'm not alone in this. Please, any story or other response would help. 

And a big congrats to the quitters on this sub. You guys are awesome!

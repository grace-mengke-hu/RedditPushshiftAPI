Giving this another shot.

I made it almost 3 months before falling for the old "go out to the bar with friends and decide just one cigarette can't hurt" trick. Been off the wagon for almost a month, but today I'm getting back on. It's weird being able to feel the change in my body after starting smoking again. Everything feels awful! I don't know how I've been living like this for the last 15 years. So here we go! Kind of excited about it this time around.

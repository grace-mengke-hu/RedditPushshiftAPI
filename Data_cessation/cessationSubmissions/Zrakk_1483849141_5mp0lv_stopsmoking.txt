I don't know how but this is my third week without smoking. How did you feel at this point?

Usually did 2 packs per week and while studying for my exams easily could do 1 pack a day. I'm a really anxious guy and right now I can't differentiate if I am nervous because of my personality or because I stopped smoking haha. 
Any comment or advice would be truly appreciated.
Thanks!

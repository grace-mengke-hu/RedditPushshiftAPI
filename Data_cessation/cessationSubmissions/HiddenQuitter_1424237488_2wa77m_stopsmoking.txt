Something amazing just happened to me (Day 1)

About an hour ago, I was finishing up a several paragraph post here about how pessimistic I am about quitting (AGAIN,) and how sure I was of relapse. I was posting as a last ditch hope to stop me from giving in...less than 24 hours after quitting. I've been smoking daily for 7+ years, with a few more years of "social smoking" before that. I've "quit" maybe 3-4 times, and each time I've relapsed. 

 

Each time I relapse, it's because of some taxing emotional/stress related incident. It's stupid because it's usually months after quitting, after the worst of the withdrawals/cravings have passed. But I have ALWAYS used smoking as a crutch for stress and emotional issues. 

 

So, here I was, thinking about how futile it was to quit again and how goddamn badly I wanted a cigarette. (I'll confess that I have an "emergency cigarette" in my house...) Then, right as I was re-reading my post before submitting, I got a text message from a friend of mine. It turns out that the person I was dating, the first person I've had feelings for since I broke up with my ex (long term relationship - we lived together) almost 2 years ago, the person who had turned suddenly distant recently, had asked out a mutual friend of ours on a date last week. 

 

Oh fuck. Bad timing, right? My first thoughts were to:

* Scream
* Hit something
* Pour myself an enormous drink
* Oh yeah, and smoke about a million cigarettes.

 

There was about 5 minutes there where I sat in front of my computer, vacillating back and forth between being 100% ready to throw in the towel (that emergency cigarette was right there, but I was about to hop in the car and go buy a whole pack) and repeatedly telling myself to calm the fuck down and just breathe.

 

So I went and took a shower. I thought about it. I thought about how I didn't want to be weak anymore. I don't want to be unable to cope with negative things in my life without being self-destructive. I want to fucking grow up and deal with my problems. I don't want this person, who doesn't care about me, to be the reason I relapse AGAIN. Not for some vindictive "fuck you" but because it's OK if things don't work out "right" all the time. I deserve better than being with someone who doesn't reciprocate my feelings and I deserve better than numbing myself with cigarettes.

 

And now, after all of this, I've made it past the 24 hour mark, and am feeling so optimistic. Maybe I'll relapse again, maybe not. But last year I relapsed after MONTHS because I failed an exam. Today, at my lowest low, in the thick of a godawful craving, after getting an emotional punch to the gut, I resisted. 

 

Here's to DAY 1

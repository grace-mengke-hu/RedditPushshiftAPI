I broke free.

Dear all,

Just a short note announcing that I have break free.

This is not my first attempt, but surely the most well-prepared one. I got myself pretty well educated on this quitting business for the last several months, but my last several attempts still failed. Today, I spent the whole day re-read and taking notes extensively from the Easy Way book of Allen Carr, then organize them accordingly to best prepare my quit. 

One of my task in this attempt is to engage actively with this community and Livestrong community as well. Even I'm quite inactive online, I feel the need to interact to keep a positive mind, to share my understanding on this and to remind myself about the knowledge found. In the following days/weeks, I will do my best to contribute something to this community with any information I have.

Wish you all an enjoyable route to breaking free.

Best,
Du

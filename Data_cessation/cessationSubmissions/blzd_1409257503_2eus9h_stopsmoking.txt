Morning of day one... The itch is real.

I watched the Allen Carr video last night and smoked my last cig before bed and I must say, I am excited to quit. But this is the hardest part for me, the morning. I know I'm strong enough, but the little nicotine monster just keeps saying, "go get a pack and smoke one...", "you don't have to quit the morning cig right now, just quit the rest..." , "this is already hard enough, imagine tomorrow!" I don't want to replace cigarettes with anything else. I do use cannabis, and one of my special cigarettes is right after I toke. Idk why I'm saying all this, mostly just to rationalize it in my mind that I AM DONE SMOKING, I AM NOT A SMOKER, I HAVE ALREADY QUIT! Starve the monster! Here's to day two...

I Quit... this sub

Seeing as this is r/stopsmoking, I figured that it would be a supportive place for anyone who wants to quit smoking by whatever method they choose, including those which have been statistically shown to be more effective than cold turkey.  I never hear complaints about people who use nicotine gum or nicotine patches, yet anyone who vapes gets told that they're still a smoker.  Fuck that.  I'm out.  Best of luck to anyone who chooses to quit smoking by whichever method they choose, but if you use vape as a quit smoking aid, you're better off seeking support elsewhere!

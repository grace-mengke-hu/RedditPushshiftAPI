I LOVE my star! Gratitude.

On my phone I don't get to see the star badge by my name. So I am so delighted to log into reddit today and SEE that fancy badge. oh yeah! 

I'm proud of myself every moment I don't smoke a cigarette when I crave one, and every day that I move forward. I can't wait for the continued freedom and good feelings that come with this life altering decision. 

Way to go everybody on your fortitude, willingness, commitment, and for keeping getting back up no matter how many times it takes. Thank you to everybody for your inspiration and support! Very grateful to myself and to everybody that has supported me. each breath I intake without cigarettes is a freer breath and a freer me! Each craving I resist strengthens my brain and body and reprograms the old channels. This is terrific!

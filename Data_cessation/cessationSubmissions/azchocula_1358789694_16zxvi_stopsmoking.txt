I've set my quit date and told my family and friends. What else do I need to do?

I've purchased an e-cig and set a quit date of February 4. I've prepared my wife for the impending irritability and told my other close friends. Are there ways that you folks who have been successful have prepared yourself mentally/emotionally for the big day? What have I not planned for? As a side note, I have tried quitting twice before. We have a baby on the way, though, and I am determined to make this one stick.

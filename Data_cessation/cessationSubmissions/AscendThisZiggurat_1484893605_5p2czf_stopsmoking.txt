1 month!

I'm not really sure what I'm looking for... I guess support and reassurance that I can continue kicking this habit's ass. I'm 30 years old,  and started smoking a year and a half ago (you read that right, I'm the idiot who started smoking after 25 even though no one does).

I had an extremely difficult year in 2015, and after the death of a family member, I took up the worst habit I could have chosen (next to heroin).

This isn't an excuse, and for the last 6 months, I have struggled with the reality that I had finally found my vice. 

2016 wasn't any easier, and came with a slew of health issues and hospital stays. I was consistently able to stop smoking when I was otherwise engaged, and never really smoked more than 10 a day, but I was clearly addicted. 

In December my health slipped even further, and though it had nothing to do with the habit, I know it didn't help. I had planned on Jan 1 (resolution and all that) but Dec. 19th, I just stopped.

It hasn't been easy, but it hasn't been as hard as I'd assumed (it is so sad that we are made to believe quitting is just too hard). I feel genuinely lucky that I only smoked for such a short time, I know that made a difference. Yep - I quit,  cold turkey, 1 month ago today, and more than anything I am amazed I had the strength. 

I'm still very ill and stressed, so it feels like a constant battle, though one getting easier every day; I just need the strength not to relapse. 

If you're lurking, and *thinking* of quitting -- even if you've smoked for 20 years -- today is always better than tomorrow.

22 years old, smoker for 5 years now, is quitting really worth it? Will I feel better?

Hey everyone,

I've been a half-a-pack-a-day smoker for around 5 years now. I enjoy cigarettes, I smoke because I want to, and I feel like the pleasure I get from each cig makes quitting not worth it. I'm completely aware of the detrimental effects of smoking, but I still do it because I don't know how good quitting feels. Being that I'm 22 & not a long-term smoker who has no noticeable damage to his health, if I stopped right now, would I notice any improvements in my life? Part of me says to myself "I'll stop smoking before I'm 30", am I being stupid?

Does anyone else get painful cravings?

My final goal is to never smoke another cigarette again but these pains i get in my body are horrible. It's like my chest caves in and I cant think anymore. I know smoking is bad for my health but I feel like these cravings wont go away... Tell me I'm not alone.

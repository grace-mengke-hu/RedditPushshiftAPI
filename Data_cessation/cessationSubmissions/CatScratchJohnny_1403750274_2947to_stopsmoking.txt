I've been smoking for over 9,000 days (25 years). Now I'm working on day 1 of not smoking. Glad you guys are here.

My problem hasn't been failing to quit, it's been failing to even try. I've been smoking for more than half my life (I'm almost 40), and tonight is the first time I'm planning on not having a pack at my disposal. Thinking even a few hours ahead just makes me so uncomfortable. If smoking is my enemy, then anxiety is my fucking arch-nemesis... so this should be interesting. Minute by minute, urge by urge is all I have.

I'm currently wearing a patch, and plan to use any reasonable aids I can. I have an e-cigarette in the car, but honestly I hate the damn thing. It seems to irritate my lungs more than exhaust fumes do.

If I fail this time, then so be it, I'm not looking that far forward. Anything is better than not trying. I'll grab a badge once I hit 24 hours. You guys know the drill, I'm just putting this here to vocalize my attempt.

Like I said, thanks for being here.

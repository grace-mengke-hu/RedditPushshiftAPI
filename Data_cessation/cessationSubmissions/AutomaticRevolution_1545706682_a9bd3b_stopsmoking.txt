Dad ex smoker saw me smoking

Hey, I'm not sure if this is the right sub..
I'm just worried. Im trying to quit for a while now and I've been trying to hide that I smoke from my dad bc he's an ex smoker so Im afraid he will miss if he sees me smoking and get back on.
Well he just saw me smoking but didnt say anything about it, just acted strangely as if he didnt see anything... should I be worried that he'll go back? Or is it just something in my head? 
I would feel terrible if he started smoking again.
Thanks and merry xmas.

Thats just about live

...thanks guys. I ve read your comments and there are some really good points in it. Even for me!
Really I am usually fairly good at this stuff. People and realtions I mean. (not my own) ;)
And when you start believing "you know everything" then you meet people like you saying just this one more sentence which Can make the difference.
I see cigarettes like any other problem in live. Its Your choice. And yours alone. And like in moments when we feel real bad its very difficult to start having good thoughts and the will to do something to treat yourself. Ciggies ist just one more of tge bunch you can start getting done. And dont worry. If you havent learnt dealing with problems and always did run away its just another test for you starting now.
Every problem is a opportinity to grow.
THEY are making us to the persons we are. Because THEN we make decisions not from the cozy little couch but in moments to step out of your comfort zone.
Those which mateers to us!
Ciao

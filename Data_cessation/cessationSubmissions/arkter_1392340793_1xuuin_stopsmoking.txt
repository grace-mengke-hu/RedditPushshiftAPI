Why do I still feel like a cigarette?

I don't get my brain at the moment. I haven't been smoking for 3 weeks now. When someone at the office walks past me after going out for a cigarette they smell disgusting and repulsive. I know that smoking is catastrophic for my health.

Why do I WANT a cigarette every now and then? It doesn't make sense to my logical side, yet I'm sitting here thinking 'Fuck, I really want a cig'.

Talking to myself, rationalizing another hit. Help.

I'm 21, smoked various substances for more than four years, quit smoking on the 1st of January, and I felt great (no cravings, not a damn thing) until about an hour ago, where the most intense bout of lethargy hit me during my workout at the gym - I felt suddenly like having a smoke, or a nice deep hit of dokha (which I've been addicted to for the past year).

I happened to run out of both cigarettes and dokha on the 31st, and resolved not to purchase some in order to start the new year better. 

About an hour ago, I swear I was momentarily hearing *actual* voices in my head telling me to go buy another pack, or how I can smoke and just taper down until February, or whatever other argument that these 'voices' presented that I determined was my addiction trying to get the better of me.

I've never attempted to quit before. It took **everything** in me to finish my workout, stay awake, drive home, not buy a pack, not buy a bottle of dokha, not bum a cigarette, not take the detour, not buy a pack of Nicorettes, not eat some garbage to stave off the cravings, and just make it back home in one piece where I know there's nothing to smoke.

I'm currently trying to stay awake, have downed two cups of black coffee, and puffing away on a vaporizer full of glycerin (to satiate the oral fixation), dying to get some nicotine in.

Does anyone have any advice? I'm pretty sure I've attempted to punch way above my weight, since I quit drinking sodas at the same time, and there may be some component of caffeine and sugar withdrawal to this as well that's compounding the difficulty. Please help. I can't think straight.

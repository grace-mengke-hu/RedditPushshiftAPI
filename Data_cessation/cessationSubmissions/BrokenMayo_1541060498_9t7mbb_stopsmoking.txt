How do you avoid smoking whilst drinking?

I am managing very well to not smoke whilst sober, I am not worried about that, my problem now is figuring out how to avoid smoking when me and my friends go drinking.

I've thought about not going drinking, but I'd be giving up my entire social life, and my friends wouldn't be too interested in doing anything else with their money (( students I guess ))

Is the answer to drink light and have water between drinks?

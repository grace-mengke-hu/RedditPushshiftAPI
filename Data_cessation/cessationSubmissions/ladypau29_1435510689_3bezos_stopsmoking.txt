Major progress. First time I can post here with positive news. :)

I know there's a lot of hate about vaping sometimes but I really wanted to share my progress because I've been struggling to get to this point for a year a half now. 

I finally got myself a proper set up for my vape and somehow, without noticing, I got to the point that I find cigarettes disgusting. The few times I've made the mistake of thinking I wanted one, I've turned it off or given it away after a single puff. The taste left in my mouth is so gross and I can't stand the smell left on my hands. When I step into an elevator that was previously used by someone that just smoked, I can't stand the smell. 

This is huge for me. As little as a few months ago I was still battling cravings and my e-cig was not cutting it for me, as much as I wanted it to. I'm slowly decreasing the nicotine levels in my juice but I'm so happy!! I can feel my lungs work better and my sense of smell is back. Sorry if I'm rambling, I'm just so happy to be getting to this point. To stop smoking tobacco was my step one, but it was major for me. 

Thank you so much for inspiring me to keep pushing through this. I don't think I could've gotten to this point without this sub. The work is not over but I feel soo motivated to get to a completely nicotine free point.

Warmer weather bringing on cravings from hell at 3 1/2 months smoke free.

Quit 3 1/2 months ago in the dead of winter and lately over the last month my cravings have been getting worse but holy crap they’re terrible now. With it nice and warm here in NC I’m spending more time outside and it’s like my brain is screaming at me to smoke. I use to do the majority of my smoking outside during the spring and summer months so I’m guessing thats what’s triggering it. This is getting hard to resist. Anyone have some advice? I’m trying my normal routine to try and sidestep the cravings but it’s getting tough. Never had them this bad before!

3 days smoke free (using low nrt). So far so good.

I posted 11 days ago about how I was considering stopping smoking after nearly 10 years. Well I finally decided to do it and I had my last cigarette at 2:15pm on Thursday. I didnâ€™t even enjoy it so I think that helped. I gave my remaining tobacco to a friend and threw away all my ashtrays. 

I have been using an e-cigarette. Iâ€™m using 0.6% juice so itâ€™s pretty weak (I think?) and Iâ€™m only trying to use it every 2-3 hours. The first 2 days were so difficult. I kept getting excited because my brain kept telling me it was cig time. I even automatically reached over for my non existent tobacco a few times. I got pretty emotional and just wanted to smoke. Even told myself I didnâ€™t care if I got lung cancer! But I havenâ€™t given in yet. The cravings arenâ€™t as bad today. Iâ€™m not feeling like I should be doing something all the time anymore and Iâ€™m not waking up dying for w cigarette. 

Iâ€™m a bit restless in my sleep. Iâ€™ve been waking up a lot. Iâ€™ve also been dreaming of smoking and I canâ€™t recall ever dreaming of smoking before! Oh and Iâ€™m also feeling really tired. Idk if thatâ€™s cos I keep waking up or what, I had like 13 hours sleep last night and I feel exhausted and itâ€™s only 3pm. 

Iâ€™m feeling good though and proud of myself. Itâ€™s only been 3 days but thatâ€™s the longest Iâ€™ve gone without a cigarette in 5 years (I tried to quit 5 years ago, didnâ€™t have the will power and caved after 3 days)

Has anyone successfully quit smoking using an ecig and then weened off the ecig too? I only bought one of the old pen looking ecigs I didnâ€™t wanna pay a fortune for the high tech ones when I donâ€™t want to vape for a long time.

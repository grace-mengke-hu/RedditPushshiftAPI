Day 12, who am I even??

So I’m going onto day 12 of not smoking. I read Alan Carr’s easy way to stop smoking and honestly it helped get me motivated. But I went into this thinking it would be WAY EASIER than it is. 
All the apps I have, all the reading I’ve done; I thought that by now I’d feel great! I’d have so much energy! I’d feel so happy and relieved to be a non smoker! 
First of all, this taste in my mouth reminds me of smoking and all I can think about is cigarettes. I have no energy, all I want to do is sleep and sleep. And I have to lose 2 inches in 3 weeks to fit into my wedding dress. I was doing great and decided to quit smoking because I thought I’d be able to run so much further. Negative because I can barely get off the couch. Unfortunately salads don’t help either lmao. I’ve jokingly wondered if I’ve snuck some nicotine in my sleep or something because day 10/11 felt like day 1/2 all over again with my inability to function without crying, yelling or just wanting to curl up and go to sleep. I have 2 kids and a fiancée so sadly this doesn’t work for me. 
It doesn’t even feel right to me to say I’m a non smoker. I’ve smoked since I was 11, it’s always defined who I am and been my escape from social situations. Where people used to use smoking as a social lubricant, I used it as a reason to excuse myself. 
I really need this to get easier. I keep telling myself over and over that it’s just the nicotine leaving, it’s just me getting over a literal drug addiction , there’s nothing appealing about smoking, it was all about nicotine from the beginning and nothing helps. 
Thanks to anyone who reads this. It’s my first time on here and I’ll appreciate any support I can get!

1 month Cold Turkey no it's not easy!

Day 1 I was so depressed that I cried.

Day 2 and 3 I was so nervous I wanted to kill someone.


Couple days after that I was felling dizzy I couldnt take that much oxygen. It was new to me.
For this 1 month my imune system gone crazy. I had couple diarrheas, herpes infection on lip, and now I have tonsils infection. And I can say that I get sick like one time per year...

But I'm smoke free, happy and bether man :)

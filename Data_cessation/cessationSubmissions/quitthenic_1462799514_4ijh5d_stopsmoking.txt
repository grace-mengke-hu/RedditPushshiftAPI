Day 1

May 9, 2016, 8:40 AM, just had my last cigarette.  Nervous, scared, but I've got to do this.  I've smoked for 30 years, mostly at a pack a day. 

About 13 years ago I quit for two years. But....relapsed.  I'm so pissed because I was soooo past nicotine.  But a cigar at a wedding was the beginning of the road back to addiction.

So here I am again.  Walking up stairs leaves me somewhat winded.  Any time I have to do physical activity I tire way to quickly.

Just decided today's the day.

Wish me luck.....please!

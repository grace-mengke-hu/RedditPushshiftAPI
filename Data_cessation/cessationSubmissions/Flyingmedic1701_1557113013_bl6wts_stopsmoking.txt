A big day + Questions on exercise

I am a bit over 2 weeks smoke free and this is the first day where I hardly thought about smoking and didn't consider driving to the gas station to buy a pack several times. Im very happy about that. Hopefully it keeps getting better.   


That being said I would like to start exercising at some point and get even more healthier. However, I have been wanting to give myself time to get free from cigarettes and let my lungs clear up a little before I start working out. Im not planning any crazy intense work outs. But when do you think would be a good point when I could go for a light jog and not feel like I will die? haha.

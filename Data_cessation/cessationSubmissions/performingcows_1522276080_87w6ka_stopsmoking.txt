can't get past 72 hours

So I started trying to quit a week ago. Twice now, the first two days have been fine, then on the third i bummed a smoke off someone. I never bought any and always got back on track the next day, but it just sucks that I can't stay completely off. Any advice on dealing with the urge to have one after the immediate resolve has passed and it's just so easy to get a cigarette from someone? Pretty frustrated at myself.

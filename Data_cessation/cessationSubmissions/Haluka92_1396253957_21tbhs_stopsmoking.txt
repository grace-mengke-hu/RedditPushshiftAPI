On my 3rd day! Yesss!

The first two days were absolute hell, looking around for something to smoke, something to ease the cravings but I didn't cave in! On the 3rd day today and this just seems easy from now on.

I've been using an e-cig, and I'm just plain amazed at how much its helped me! I'm doing this for myself. For the first time in about 6 years I woke up without feeling horrible, not pain in my body, didn't feel like my lung was about to explode. 

I'm just so bloody proud of myself right now! :D

Today's the day!

I ran a half-marathon in April, and stupidly picked smoking back up basically as soon as I crossed the finish line.  I had been about three and a half months of mostly quit (maybe three or four cigarettes a week) during my training program.  Since then I've been lazy and gotten back up to smoking about a pack a day - more than I've ever smoked.

Today I say fuck that shit.  I have my ecig (I know you guys have mixed feelings on this, but I think it's the best option for me right now) and I'm ready to do this.  Tonight I'm going on my first real run in several months and I'm going to get back in shape.  I'm so looking forward to waking up without that horrible taste in my mouth, and running without my lungs fighting me.

Cheers to today!

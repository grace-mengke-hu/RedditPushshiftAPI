Super sore throat?

So i've been smoking since I was 16 (5 years) at anywhere from 10-30 cigarettes a day. I finally decided that I need to quit! 

It's only been 2 days, but I feel good, no real cravings yet. But I have noticed that my throat is extremely sore. I may just be getting sick, but I was curious if a sore throat could be related to quitting, if so, what causes it?

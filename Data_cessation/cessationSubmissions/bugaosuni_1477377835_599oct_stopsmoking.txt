Wife and I just had a (minor) fight. She found me outside late at night looking at the sky. Asked me "are you smoking again?"

Feels so good to not only not be smoking, but to **know** that I don't stink of tobacco.  I just confidently shook my head no as she approached me, with the full confidence that I don't even want to smoke.  Yeah, I wanted to clear my head or whatever, but in no way did I want to smoke.  Hell no.

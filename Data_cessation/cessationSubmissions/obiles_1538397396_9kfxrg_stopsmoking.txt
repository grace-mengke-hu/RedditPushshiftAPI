I'm quitting smoking.

Hi all,

This is such a strange thing to write. I never realised how difficult it will be to quit smoking. I'm 26 and I started smoking this year. I wonder why I started. Before cigarettes I always thought I'm a strong person who can deal with everything and I was judging my mother for not being able to stop smoking, oh boy how wrong I've been! It's funny how from someone who never touched a cigarette, not even as a teenager, turned into a pack a day compulsive smoker and having such a difficult time defeating the urges that comes and feeling so weak for not being able to do so. 

Apparently it takes a scare to provoke someone to think about themselves. I had periods of feeling scared because of a step throat or something similar and then a couple minutes later I would be smoking few cigarettes in a row. This time, again with the help of Uncle Google it determined that my stiff neck and swollen glands are probably cancer (although there are more common things it could be like a viral infection or the fact that I spend 10 hours in a hair salon without being able to move my neck..) but I'm going to my GP tomorrow to see what they say. But it's just ridiculous how these things can make someone re-evaluate their life. I don't think I'm ready for the anxiety and the withdrawal symptoms and being mean to the people close to me. But I have the determination this time around.

I really hope this subreddit will be guiding me through my smoke free days.

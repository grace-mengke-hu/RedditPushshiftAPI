One year smoke free (after 27 months of effort)!

Started my journey in May 2016. Made it 10 months smoke free and then I faltered. I had a very stressful life event happen and I went back to my old friend the cig. I hated that I failed after 10 months. Spent the next 6 months mostly on/off smoking before I got really upset and decided it was time. I kicked off my new journey one year ago today and can officially say that I am smoke free for one year officially and In reality, smoke free for the last 24/27 months.  Someday I will acknowledge that I have been smoke free for mostly 2 years but today I celebrate 1 official year, 365 days straight!

During this last year, I have not thought about smoking really at all with the exception of a few nights here and there (maybe 10 times total). I have switched my mind set that slipping isn’t an option. In the early days, I allowed myself anything else to avoid the triggers - being lazy, no exercise, lots of exercise, good food, lots of sweets etc. I gained weight. Not a ton but a good 5 pounds which is the heaviest I have been outside of pregnancy. I am now working on losing that.

I set out on this journey to change my life and to make my young kids and husband proud. I didn’t want my children seeing me smoke. My dad smoked. I smoked. I wanted to change this trajectory for my family. I smoked on and off for 15 years. Stopped during pregnancies and restarted each time. I was a closet smoker to most people. My husband had no idea how much I really smoked - a pack most days. 

Today, I celebrate. If I can do it, you can too!! Best of luck to those starting on their journey. It’s not easy, but the feeling when you cross the finish line is truly amazing. If I can do this, I feel like I can accomplish anything! You can too!

NEED to quit, prescribed Chantix

I've been smoking for just over 7 years now. In this week so far, I have begun having trouble breathing--feeling as if I can't catch my breath or need to breath deeply but can't. I've never experienced something like this and I feel that either smoking has created this or it's a contributing factor.

I was just prescribed Chantix and the script is waiting for me at the pharmacy but I am hesitant to pick it up and start it because there's a lot of cautionary side effects and archived posts of this subreddit mentioning personal experiences that went badly. I'm already on an anti-depressant/anti-anxiety medication and I'm worried it will conflict.

Cold turkey has been a struggle of mine. I have yet to quit cold for more than six months. At this point I'm willing to try other quitting options but perhaps I should try things like vaping, patches, or gum before I swallow down Chantix.

Suggestions? Recommendations? Cautionary tales? I really need to attack quitting but I want a plan before I just cold turkey again.

Change your perspective to make quitting easier

Complete self control is a virtue. In my opinion, it shows real strength. A man who controls himself and resists urges exhibits the very definition of manliness. 

In my quest to become a better man (working out, reading, working at school, etc) I realized there was something holding me back. A daily habit I've had for years that completely controls and masks my emotions. I realized one day that I didn't control my self, a chemical did. To completely embrace my masculinity, that chemical had to go. 

I quit smoking on Monday. There is a huge difference between quitting with the idea that smoking is a guilty vice and quitting with the idea that smoking is an ugly weakness holding me back. Every time I crave a cigarette, the man inside me (the one who pushes me to do 2 more reps than I did last time I worked every other day for the past year) laughs and calls me a sissy. I haven't even considered smoking.

I have self control. I am strong. I am an ex-smoker, and I am a man.

(Obviously, this applies to women as well. Rather than trying to be the best man you can be, be the best woman you can be! Being a man, I wish to emulate the "male" qualities I find appealing. I want it to be clear that I'm not sexist, nor am I a "bro". Work with me here :) )

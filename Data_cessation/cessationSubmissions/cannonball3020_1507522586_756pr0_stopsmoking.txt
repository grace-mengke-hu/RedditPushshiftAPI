Day 9 today after 10 years of smoking. It was the worse one yet. Does it ever get easier or do you just get used to always wanting a cigarette?

I fell like I’m a schizophrenic. Like I’m not me. I’m depressed, blindly angry, and feel like I’m a monster. I’ve never been so angry for such a long time. I feel like my negativity is only alienating me from anyone who wants to help. Today was the worst day yet and I’m broken down with nothing left. When will this affliction end? When did it end for you?

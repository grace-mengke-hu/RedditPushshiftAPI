I still WANT to smoke.

You know how they say "you'll quit when you're ready?" Well that's not the case for me. I did WANT to quit...in my 20's, when Quit #1 lasted 6 months. Then I WANTED to quit again about 3 years ago, and that time, I made it a whole year. And I wish I never smoked "just one" after that, because ever since, I've not felt the desire to quit. 

I don't WANT to quit...I HAVE to quit. I think my addiction just got so embedded into the very fabric of my being, that WANTING to quit is no longer an option. Does anyone else get what I'm saying? But good grief! If I waited until the next time I WANTED to quit, well I'd probably be dead from some form of carcinoma. 

Like I said, I HAVE to quit. After years of putting it off and telling myself I'm fine, my body finally hurts from this addiction. I could feel myself rotting from the inside-out. And the destruction to my self-esteem is paralleled by the destruction to my health, for what self-respecting person would continue to slowly kill themselves when every cell in their body is screaming to stop? 

So that's why I'm here...because I HAVE to be. I wish I WANTED to be, but the honest to God truth is I don't. I miss smoking. I feel empty without it. I want to kill everyone around me (although I've learned the past 4 days that I'm a great actress, for if I truly said what's on my mind, I'dve been fired already, lol). 

I hope, however, to get to the day where I want to stay smoke free.

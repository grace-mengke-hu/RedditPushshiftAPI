2 weeks in, feeling great!

Its officially been two weeks since ive had a cigarette! It was mine and a buddies new years resolution to stop smoking. We decided to go to this vapor shop that our boss recomended. We spent maybe $50 on a vaporizer and some flavoring that had nicotene in it. We puffed on it for the day and both decided we never wanted to go back to cigs. In the two weeks weve been free from them, weve bought maybe 6 or 7 of the hundreds of flavors they have, and have gotten sick at the smell of a cigarette. I already feel 10x better, I can breathe better than before, im sleeping better, and im just all around happier! Im so glad ive been able to quit thanks to this $50 vaporizer!

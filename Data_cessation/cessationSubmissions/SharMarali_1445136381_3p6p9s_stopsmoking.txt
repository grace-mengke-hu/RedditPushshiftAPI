Was pointed over here, thought I'd stop by and say hi!

I made [this post](https://np.reddit.com/r/self/comments/3p6c0g/im_a_packaday_smoker_because_of_a_terrible_cold_i/) about an hour ago over in /r/self.  It's pretty short, but the gist of it is, I caught a terrible cold a few days ago.  My breathing was so bad initially that I was completely unable to smoke even if I wanted to.  I thought "hey, I'm already through the worst part of withdrawal, so why not just keep on going?"

I do feel like I'm cheating, because I was *unable* to smoke for the first couple of days, and I slept through most of the withdrawal.  But I'm serious about not wanting to start up again.  Every time I get sick, I end up gasping for air a lot, and every time, I think "I should really quit smoking."

For whatever reason, this time, I decided to actually do it.

So uh, hi!  I'm not great with introductions.  I like stuff.

Fantastic support thank you

8 days and counting and it's getting easier! I have been reading the links from this site for the last 8 days and have just joined all the way from Watford, UK. If it wasn't for the support everyone gives each other I would be back smoking by now.

Keep up the good work everyone and thank you :)

Just found this subreddit and have been looking for a reason to quit

I've smoked for about 3 years now. Since the end of my junior year in college (I was always stressed out in school). I smoke a couple cigarettes a day, sometimes close to a pack if I've been around a lot of people. And I hate it. 

It started as a stress-reliever and now it's a way for me to escape for a couple minutes at a time from work, or a party, or whatever. I look forward to smoking not because I want the actual cigarette but because it gives me some time to lean against a wall and look at my phone, though there are definitely times when I get a "craving".

After seeing this subreddit, I'm throwing out my pack and really trying.

Just wanted to make this post to make it more real and to try to get any advice any of you can give me.
Thanks

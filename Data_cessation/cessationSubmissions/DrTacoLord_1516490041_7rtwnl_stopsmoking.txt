An advice for everyone alike

Damn. i hope that that title doesn't make me sound too arrogant, cause that's not the point, I am like you someone who struggles sometimes with urges to smoke, even if I quitted almost three years ago.

To say, or even think ' I won't smoke never again for the rest of my life' is a pretty daunting and terrifying thought, and sometimes we might feel 'that's too long, idk if I could carry on that much time'.

Well, I cope with this with a simple idea. Just like that old GOT meme "not today'. The very first day I quitted smoking for good, it was only for a day, then the next day I told myself, 'well, not today either, and I went on until today 895 days of Not today, and I'm sure that tomorrow will be another "not today"

TL DR.. instead of thinking I won't smoke never again, start every day with 'not today'

This quit attempt feels different

I have quit a few times in the past, never for more than a couple of weeks/months at a time. The longest I have stayed truly quit for in my roughly 8 years of smoking is about 6 months. I quit just over 3 weeks ago, and while I wouldn't say it was spur of the moment, it certainly wasn't meticulously planned. 

There is one thing, that until now I hadn't noticed, that makes me think this quit attempt will be the one that sticks. I just realised how little I think about smoking this time around. Over the past 3 or so weeks I have had a LITTLE bit of trouble sleeping, and have found myself frustrated at work or at pointless things at home, but I have never linked these thoughts to not smoking. It is only now that I have realised that the lack of nicotine is probably what has caused these affects on me. Usually when I quit, cigarettes are all I can think about, but this time, it truly has been at the back of my mind and very rarely do I really want a cigarette. My brain hasn't even been making the link between irritability and sleeplessness with the lack of nicotine. 

I even bought Allen Carr's book, but I haven't even opened it yet, I haven't felt the need to and now I'm not sure if I should start, it may cause me to think more about smoking!

I just felt urged to share how happy I am with my latest quit attempt, this one really does feel different. I feel like I have just subconsciously decided to block out all thoughts of smoking, even when over half my office go out for frequent smoke breaks. I even went out with them once just for fresh air, and I realised how ridiculous I felt just standing outside, and then I thought that's how non-smokers must feel.

I'm not sure how well I've expressed myself or if I'm just rambling, but I definitely feel good and extremely motivated to continue!

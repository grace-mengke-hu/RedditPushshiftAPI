Craving. First serious one I've had since I quit.

I'm at a Holiday Inn in Portland, OR and I just finished a meal and three insanely delicious Ninkasi Total Domination IPA's. I want a smoke. I can absolutely say that I will not have one. But I want one. 

I haven't felt this way a single time since I quit but I wanted to be honest with you all and I think maybe it will help somebody, somewhere, to know what I'm going through. 

My mentor, Captain Awesome, would be so disappointed if I smoked. I won't let him, or the rest of you wonderful folks, down. 

Cheers.

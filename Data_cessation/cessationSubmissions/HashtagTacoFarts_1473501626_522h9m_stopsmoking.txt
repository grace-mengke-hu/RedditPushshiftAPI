Giving up cigarettes and need support.

I started smoking when I was 13 and now I am 22. I live at home with my parents, my farther is a smoker and he has always bought me packs. Since he is a smoker he understands the crave. I have just recently written him a note asking not to buy me any more packs or give me any cigarettes if I ask. I have quit once before when I was 20 but as soon as I turned 21 I fell back into it. Now I am feeling the damage it is doing on my lungs and I want to quit for good. I am to insecure to ask my family for support so I turn to this community to help me through this endeavor.

Smoking Nightmares!!!

Past 7 days or so I have been badly affected by nightmares.

Most of them are related to smoking... and yes if you guessed correctly every single dream was about relapsing!! It does not sound great to start from the scratch and literally gets on your nerves! ):

Anyone with such prior experiences, any sort of explanations ? Mostly any resolutions anybody is having?

Please suggest.

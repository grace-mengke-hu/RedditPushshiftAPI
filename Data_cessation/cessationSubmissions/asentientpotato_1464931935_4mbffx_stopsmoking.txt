Today has been 5 months for me

The first week I felt irritated, then anxious. It got worse from there.

I got violently ill. I cried for weeks over nothing.

Kept going.

I became apathetic. Convinced myself life could never be as good as before. I became a shell.

Kept going.

Thought about ending it all. Mentally checked out. Lost interest. Lost hope.

Kept going.

One day to my surprise I realized I was alive. Dunno what happened.

I was breathing. I kept breathing and it felt damn good.

You can do it too.

Goddammit Its gonna be the worst.

You'll hate every second of it. You'll wanna faceplant a machete everyday for a while. Ignore that, find some cool shit to occupy yourself. Keep going.

Like so many things in life, you will inevitably reach a point where this shit just gets easier. You'll start to feel okay with just existing. Give it time.

That's where I am.
Feel really good today. Felt like sharing my story, thanks for reading.

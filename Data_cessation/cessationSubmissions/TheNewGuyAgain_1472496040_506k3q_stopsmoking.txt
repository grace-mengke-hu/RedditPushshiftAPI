6 days in and I'm still having strong cravings

Is this normal?  I started smoking 13 years ago and the last 4 years I've been averaging 2 packs a day.  It's been 6 days since I quit cold turkey (with the help of Allen Carr's book).  I'm still getting really strong cravings which I've been able to fight off with positive thinking.  I have also felt very fatigued and disoriented which makes this harder.  To top it off, I woke up this morning with what seems like a cold.  Is all of this normal?  I thought I was supposed to feel better after 6 days, but I feel like absolute crap.

Alright, time to quit....again

I know this seems to be a running theme here ("here I am..quitting again") but after finding this subreddit I feel like I can do it this time. What can I say? You guys have inspired me :P

I've tried heaps of times to quit and in different ways (cold turkey, vaping, even champix didn't seem to help me) but just seeing this community and seeing that there are others out there trying really hard and even failing a few times along the way gives me hope 

I'm 24 and I've been smoking for 6 years. Never has smoking caused me nothing but problems (financial burdens, feeling unfit and unhealthy in general) 

I bought my last pack this morning and have decided that will be my last

So I guess I just want to thank you all for giving me hope! And I hope I can report back with a bit of a success story :) 

And if anyone has any tips that they are willing to offer I'm all ears!

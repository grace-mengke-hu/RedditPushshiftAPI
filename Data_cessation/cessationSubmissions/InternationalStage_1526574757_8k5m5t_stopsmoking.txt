Just thinking is it worth stopping right now

I'm going through a stressful period, my relationship of 5 years is coming to an end. Also I'm opening a bar soon, in which I will work for most of the week. Most of the people here smoke. 


I haven't smoked for day and a half and it's not a big deal - I can manage it. But in two weeks, one evening I'm going to be buzzed in my bar with my friends and there's a huge possibility that I will relapse, so I'm wondering is it even worth quitting now? I don't know, no one does I suppose, tnx for reading.

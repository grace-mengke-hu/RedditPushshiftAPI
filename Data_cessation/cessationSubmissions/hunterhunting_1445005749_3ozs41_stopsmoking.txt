I love this subreddit.

I'm on day 12 (yay!) and sitting at work. I wanted to take a day off, but sadly because of circumstances beyond my control, I'm at the office. There's loud construction above my head, my boss is driving me crazy and I have a horrible headache. Basically I can't adult today.


I was thisclose to running to the store and buying a pack. Instead I decided to read some posts. Feeling strong again + I'm not going to smoke today.

Day 3 going ok, these things are helping...

Now on day 3 without smoking. 
It's getting better I think. 
These things are helping me...

- Reading this subreddit 2-3 times a day. I usually find something that resonates with me to keep going. 

- Still reading the WhyQuit.com eBook (usually after work). Also bought the Kindle edition

- Made a list of 9 Recovery Motivations that I carry with me (in my notes app)

- I got the Smoke Free iOS app (free) - the one with green branding. It gives some nice stats about the benefits achieved already.

- Remembering that, after 22 years of addiction, within a few days from now I'll be able to function normally without nicotine in my system

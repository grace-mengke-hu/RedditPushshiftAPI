Hey guys! It's time to quit. Not only for me, for YOU too.

It just sucks so fucking much.  I'm bored of being tired and lazy all the time, I have zero motivation towards anything, can't even run 50 meters without getting exhausted. It gives me nothing at all, I'm just a pathetic drug-addict, but it has been enough. More than enough... Time to quit that shit. And if you are reading this post, and hesitating, if you should quit, just remember: don't fucking lie to yourself! You WANT to quit, you wouldn't be here if you were happy with smoking. NOBODY is happy with smoking, they just fear quitting. Remember there are no advantages to smoking and no disadvantages to quitting.

So you know what? We're gonna enjoy quitting. Every single one of us. You are gonna enjoy the mornings every day, because you won't smell like shit, after brushing your teeth. Enjoy the sun, enjoy the people, enjoy your life, enjoy your freedom. FUCK CIGARETTES

Good luck!:)

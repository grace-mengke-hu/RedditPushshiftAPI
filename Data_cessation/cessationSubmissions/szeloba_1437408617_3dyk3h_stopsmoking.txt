For a millionth time... And the last time.

Hi! I needed to make an announcement in the hope it would help me. I was trying to quit for over a year now, with a success of 1 month of abstinence. I smoke since I was 19 years old, now I have 23. This time I feel like it is the right time. My family has a great chance of lung cancer, also in my country pricing of the cigarettes  are enormously high... I want to spend on better and more interesting things.
That's all. It would be really hard because I am social smoker and my friends are smokers - but I would try to eat small things instead. 
It is the last time I quit.

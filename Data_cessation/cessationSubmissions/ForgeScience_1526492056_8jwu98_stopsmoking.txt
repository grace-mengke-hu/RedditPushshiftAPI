Day 3 realizing everything fucking sucks.

I quit like 9 months ago, it nearly killed me and then started again when I got my new job (4 months ago). On day 3, after the past two long ass days, realizing how much everything fucking sucks. No amount of mental bs makes it easier. Only thing keeping me going, much like last time, is jesus fuck this has been so fucking heinously shit that I don't want to do it again.

Please fucking kill me, and to top it all off I'm going into fucking shit work today with a mind full of demons on top of my vicious craving cycle.

FUCK EVERYTHING.

OMG The Dreams

It's been since Jan. this year that I haven't smoked and I have 2-3 dreams a week about smoking. I still get grossed out by the smell of ppl who smoke, and the thought of the taste but the feeling of smoking is the hardest to get past, for me! It feels like forever ago that I quit so I wish these feelings would go away!!

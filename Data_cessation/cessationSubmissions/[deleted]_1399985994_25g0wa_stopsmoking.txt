Three Days Away

In three days I will hit my two week mark. Holy moly! I can't believe I have made it this far. I was thinking about smoking the other day, but not in terms of wanting one. No, it was the stupid crap I had to go through to hide it. Always carrying around body spray, gum, breath mints, etc. Anything to mask it, but it never truly worked. I hated how my mouth tasted and how I felt after. I was lethargic, grumpy if I couldn't have one, and just plain blah. Now, almost two weeks later, I feel 100 times better. I've been running again. I can climb 6 flights of stairs without feeling winded. I can kiss my boyfriend without worrying if he can smell the smoke on my breath. I generally feel more awake, refreshed, alive, and happy. I'm not saying I don't have my bad days, but at this point, those bad days are due to my own attitude towards it and not because of the lack of a cigarette.

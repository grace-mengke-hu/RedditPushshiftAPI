I slipped again...need some encouragement and tough love

I had a bad morning with my two year old daughter, and after dropping her off with my father in law, I caved and bought a pack. I told myself I'd only have one and had a bad day at work and ended up having three. I slipped a few days ago, and I let that get me back into the nicotine habit. I'm willing to try again tomorrow.  I am just looking for words if encouragement and also some tough to essentially help me pull myself out of this slump. Please help!!!!

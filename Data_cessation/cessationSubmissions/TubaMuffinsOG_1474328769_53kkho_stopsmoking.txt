I just ran a half marathon

At about 7.5 months smoke free and with 3 months of consistent training I ran a half marathon this past weekend. A year ago I didn't think this was even in the realm of possible for me, a pack/day smoker for 13ish years.

I can't even see myself as a smoker anymore and I enjoy every day I remember to check the app to see how far I've come.  This is to say, if you want it bad enough you can do it. You are better than any cigarette and you deserve a healthy life. It really is worth it. It took me 4 or 5 serious tries of quitting over a few years to get it to finally stick.

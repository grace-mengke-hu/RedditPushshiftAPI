Best approach to the Allen Carr method?

I have heard on this sub that  it is recommended people smoke while they read the book. Is this true, and is it all that important? I really think I need to read this book, to ensure I quit for good this time, as I have not faltered for 11 days, which is the longest I have gone without cigarettes (or any other form of nicotine for that matter) in 10 years. Will the effect be lost on me if I have already gone this long without smoking?

EDIT: Thanks for all the responses! I have taken the advice you all gave me to read the book and not smoke, Currently on chapter 17. I really appreciate the support. I don't think I could have made it 11 days without the help of r/stopsmoking!!

Doing it for the family!

I've been a smoker for over 25 years and tried giving up many times and failed. I have 2 children they are 7 and 5, getting to that age when they are aware of what i do is killing me. 

When I opened my wallet on Tuesday i found a letter it redd:

To Daddy

Alfie, Daisy and myself love you we do not like hearing you cough first thing in the morning. We want you to be our big strong dad and husband and we do not want to be visiting you in hospital. We depend on you to keep our family strong. We know you have the willpower to quit! We believe in you for a better life xxx

As you can imagine this made me cry. The feelings of being so weak with cigarettes yet so strong with other things was driving me crazy.

Anyway that morning I threw away my fags and have not touched one since. I must do it I must succeed.

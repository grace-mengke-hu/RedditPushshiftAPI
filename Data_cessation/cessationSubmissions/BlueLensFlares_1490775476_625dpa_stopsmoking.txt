I know I should quit - there's something I'm worried about

Hi all,

I'm new to this subreddit. I've been a smoker for five years - I quit briefly in the middle for about a year and a half, came back on a year and a half ago and I want to quit again because cigarettes are very expensive and I'm worried about longterm health effects.

Something that has worried me about quitting is that I feel like I'll lose an important part of myself. It has become a nightly ritual that I go outside on the porch, smoke about 4/5 cigarettes in a row, listening to music or watching the news on my phone.

I do this because during the time, I pace back and forth thinking about different things - school, work, my future, money, the news, politics, and people I'm attracted to. I often have inspiring thoughts, breakthrough moments, moments of intense energy as I'm pacing back and forth.

I feel like I can't do that anymore, since I'd be pacing back and forth with no activity and no purpose.

Honestly, I can't really remember life during the time I quit. I imagine I must have been the same personality wise, but I don't remember.

What do you think I should do to substitute this?

Thanks!

Writer's Block

Hey guys, quit smoking about 12 hours ago and I'm already losing my mind. This will be my 4th or 5th attempt. Some of those attempts have gone a few weeks, some only a few days. What always draws me back in is my job. I work as a copywriter for an advertising firm and I constantly have to come up with creative ideas and advertising headlines. Nothing, and I mean nothing, breaks up writer's block like stepping outside for a smoke. I can't tell you how many revelations I've had between puffs of a cigarette. So I always wind up breaking and buying a pack, rationalizing that it's "the right thing for my career." What can I do? I've tried gum, taking a walk or a run, etc.

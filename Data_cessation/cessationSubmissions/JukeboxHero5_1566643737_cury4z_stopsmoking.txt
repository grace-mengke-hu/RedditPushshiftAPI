Word of warning

This is to anyone who "still smokes now and then", like I did. 

Smoked ten years, quit about a year and half ago. Started smoking at parties, realised i had no cravings the next day so i kept smoking at parties. Still identified as a non smoker. 

You can already tell where this is going. 

I was fine, no problems. Started going out more often, because partying is fun. At that time i didn't understand that i went out more often because i wanted to smoke. 

Two weeks ago me and my girlfriend of five years back broke up. Still good friends but that appareantly made breaking up worse. 

Been drinking whiskey everyother night to numb the pain, by myself. 
3 days ago i went out for a walk and got a smoke from a stranger. Fuck that tasted good. 
2 days ago, did the same but got a hold of two. 
Yesterday i bought a pack, smoked four before i passed out from the whiskey. 

Woke up this morning and saw three empty bottles in the sink, and the opened pack of smokes on the kitchencounter. Same brand i smoked as a kid. 

Wtf. Cried a little. Sat down and realised im a smoker again. 

Threw everything away, even the rest of the spirits and broke the smokes in half. 

If you read this and could identify, please be cautious. It creeps up on you and then, at first sign of weakness, it pushes you over. 

Going out for a jog now. Stay strong.

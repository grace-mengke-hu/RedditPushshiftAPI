Hi /r/stopsmoking! We're Stanford students working on a platform to help people find accountability partners. We'd love to hear your input!

Hi /r/stopsmoking!

We're a group of Stanford students working on a project that uses accountability relationships to help people make lifestyle changes. The idea is to connect someone trying to make a positive lifestyle change to someone else who is going through or has gone through similar struggles. 

Naturally one of our main demographics is people who are trying to quit smoking. We are particularly interested in your community because it is a place where people seek accountability from one another. We've noticed there's been an emphasis on this kind of relationship in this community, and we were interested in effectively digitizing it. 

We'd love your help with two things:

1. Please PM us if you would be willing to test out a prototype of our app and give us feedback.

2. Currently, we're imagining an app that connects you with someone based on the following factors:

* Whether you are looking for someone earlier on in the process for you to give guidance to, someone at a similar stage in the process for support, or someone further along who can give you guidance.
* Whether you are looking for someone who is close to you in age.
* Desired frequency of communication.
* Whether or not you want someone of the same gender.

Once you are connected with someone, you can chat as frequently as you'd like, but the app will prompt you to reach out if you haven't been on in a while. 

We'd love your thoughts on this general mechanism.

We will at no point monetize any of this and we're just trying to make something that will help people, so we'd really appreciate your feedback!

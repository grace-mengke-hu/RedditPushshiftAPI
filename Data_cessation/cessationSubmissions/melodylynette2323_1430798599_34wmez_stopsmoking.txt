You can do this!!!

I smoked for 10 years. Here's some tips that really helped me:
1)Pray and give it to God. Read your bible.
    God is so good. I went to my church and layed my last pack of cigs on the alter and said this is it. I have been smoke free for 19 days tomorrow. Praise God. Philippians 4:13 says "I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me."
2) Eating sunflowers.
    This works because part of the habit of smoking is bringing your hand to your mouth. So eating the seeds is such a big help!
3)Going for walks.
    Wow I actually want to be more active! Now that I can breathe I can be more active. Plus im losing weight. So it's a win win.
4)Using my smoke beta app.
    Journaling my diary everyday really puts everything in perspective. I can actually see how much I'm saving each day. Even better than that...you can see your health statistics improving daily. It's awesome!!!

You all can do this. Don't give up. Keep on going no matter what. If you slip up try try again i have faith that anyone who is truly ready and willing can and will succeed. GOODLUCK on your journey.

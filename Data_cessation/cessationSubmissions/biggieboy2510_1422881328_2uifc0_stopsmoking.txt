I quit caffeine last week, today I quit smoking.

Since I have an anxiety disorder, I decided to stop with possible triggers. Quitting caffeine was fairly easy, I hope this will work out too. I'm being guided by a tabacologist (a doctor specialized in quitting smoking), and she prescribed me nicotine patches. Because of my anxiety disorder, I can't take medication to quit, so some good ol' willpower will be needed as well. 

Anyways, thanks for reading!

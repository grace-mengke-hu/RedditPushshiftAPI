Quitting smoking with a husband who smokes?

So I've probably been smoking for nearly 4 years. I know its not long in comparison to most people but still. I started because all of my friends were smokers. If we went for drinks I'd be left sitting in the pub whilst they went outside to smoke so heck, I joined in. 

The first year I wouldn't say I was addicted. I'd only really smoke in company of smokers. Last year I didn't smoke for 6 months. It was due to me moving back home for a while so the change of location, circumstances and company made it so easy. And I had no struggle at all.

Now, my husband is a smoker and has no interest in quitting. I don't really care because I can't force him to want to and I'm not trying to. But how on earth do I quit when he's smoking near me all the time!? It's almost our ritual, I get home from work and we have a smoke together, before bed we have a smoke together. He will be supportive of me if I decide to quit but, it'll be so easy for me to access a smoke again.

Any tips?

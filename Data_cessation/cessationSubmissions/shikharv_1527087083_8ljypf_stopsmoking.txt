Looking for a specific quit smoking video

I saw someone posted a video about quit smoking. It was not the Alan Carr video but made on the same theme. In that video, host will ask viewers to watch the video till the end. Also, there was a group of 5 people who was with him the while time in the room. In the end, host even asked the viewers to smoke their last cigarette. If anyone can identify what video I am talking about and have the link, I would really appreciate it.

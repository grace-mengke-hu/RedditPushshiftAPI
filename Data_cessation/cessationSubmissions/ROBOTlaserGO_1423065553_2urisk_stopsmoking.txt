I quit for 2 years and have been smoking for the past 6 months. Please help.

Before when I quit I used nicotine mints for a month or so and was able to stop successfully.  I have been on and off the mints again but continue to buy packs And regret it every time I buy a pack and feel like shit about it.  This time I want to just quit smoking cold turkey but the cravings are so bad I get anxious and somewhat depressed.  I don't know what to do.

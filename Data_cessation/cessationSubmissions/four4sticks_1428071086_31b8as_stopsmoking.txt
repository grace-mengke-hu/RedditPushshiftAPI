Barely started, but I need to stop

So I just returned from a 15 minute rescue mission to pull the full pack of cigs I threw away out of the garbage can, and even as I lit up I was hating myself.

I'm 21, and have been smoking since August/September, usually no more than 6 or 7 a day but sometimes up to 10. I'm currently studying abroad, and so many people smoke in Europe. A friend of mine just died at 25 from lung cancer, and for the past week I've been excessively focused on my own mortality.

What's more, cigarettes have started to make me gag. Not the smell, or the taste, I just gag, and I don't know why, and I hate it, but I can't stop. 

I've got a plan, and a date (May 31), to quit. The day I go back to the states. I figure I'll get some gum or an ecig, and since I work long days with my dad it will force me not to smoke for at least ten hours out of the day. 

But I'm still scared. I need help. I don't want this to become a thing I do even for a year. Am I overreacting, turning to a support community already?

Day 3 HELP

Honestly I feel like caving. I'm at my favorite local bar trying to distract myself with their random books but 'The Art of Deck Planning" really isn't doing it for me. I'm so used to stepping outside and smoking here. I guess I'll just head home and hope for the best there. Could anyone share some tips on how to strengthen myself mentally? 

Any tips or tricks are a big help!

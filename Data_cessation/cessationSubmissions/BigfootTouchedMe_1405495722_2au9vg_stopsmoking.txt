Went cold turkey. Found this sub. Now I want a sandwich.

I smoked ~1/2 pack a day. Before that I had periods of not smoking or only smoking when drunk or even smoking heavier for very brief periods. I have quit many times. But here is why this is it for me. Quitting was way harder the last time I tried (1 month ago) and I caved in after 1 week. Prior to that I was able to stop very easily, I was actually scared. I don't want to smoke my entire (shortened) life. My cunning plan - never to buy smokes and never accept any if offered.

Edit: Felt like smoking and looked at this post instead. Seemed to help.

3 years!

I have just hit 3 years! Time kinda flies by after year 1. I smoked for 20 years before quitting. 

I quit using the patch and Carr's video on stop smoking. I used the patch for the full 10 weeks. It was itchy but it worked. I had vivid dreams on them though I remember, not sure if it was the patch or not smoking. 

Either way I made it and I couldn't be happier and I wanted to share the joy and say, anything is possible if you are ready and put your mind to it. This was my first quit attempt by the way. I don't crave cigarettes, matter of fact they kind of stink still. Every rare moon or so it will smell good, but I don't give in.

Good luck out there!

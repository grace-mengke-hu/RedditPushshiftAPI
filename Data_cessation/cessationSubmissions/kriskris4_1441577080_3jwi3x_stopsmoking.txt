My life revolves around smoking.

I gave up smoking weed. I stopped drinking alcohol cuz it would lead me back to weed and other drugs. The only thing I have left is smoking. 

I stopped today 5 hours ago. I have a headache from not smoking. I'm a Marlboro red pack a day smoker. I've those things. Every time I'm about to do something, or have done something, or have idle time I smoke. I don't watch tv, I don't read books, I go on IRC on my phone and chain smoke until I feel I've smoked enough. I do study though for school so I'm not that bad. 

The main thing is that my primary mode of pleasure is smoking cigarettes, or vaping, which makes you smoke even more. i do take psych medications and ashwagandha to cope with the rest of the stuff. 

I'm willing to cut down on my intake until it just remains as just water and maybe a supplement here or there.

Please give me hope to quit smoking cigs. Thanks.

Unexpected smells without smoke covering them

I'm on day 12. Day 13 in 45 minutes. Lol

So I love love love that I can smell flowers on the breeze and my delicious hair products! I'm super grateful for it.

But now I can also smell the awful thing my upstairs neighbors call food. I swear I looked around my apartment for 5 minutes thinking one of my dogs had pooped, just to walk under the air vent and BAM!

What else have you guys smelled that was unexpected?

98 day progress report.  

I almost had my first real setback a few days ago.  I was getting into some shenanigans with some friends and they lit up.  I was under the influence of [substance] and I just really wanted a cigarette.  

I asked my friends to give me one, and they refused.   

I was kind of pissed off at the time, but by the next morning I really appreciated what they had done for me.   I'm working on realizing what else could possibly trigger me.  They said that they were proud of how far I had gone without smoking and that they were going to try and quit too.   

Great friends.

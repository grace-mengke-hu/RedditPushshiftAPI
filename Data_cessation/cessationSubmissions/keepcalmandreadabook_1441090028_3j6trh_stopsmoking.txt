Don't quit quitting.

I can't even afford rent. I have a great job, don't get me wrong, but I smoke so much money away that could be used towards debt (up to my eyeballs). And I hate not exercising/yoga/meditation all because I smoke, and I feel they are contradictory. **I am so fucking sick and tired of being a slave to a small little cancerous object.** I have failed at this ten thousand times.

Here's to quitting and a new badge. I once heard a quote, "Don't quit quitting." I like that.

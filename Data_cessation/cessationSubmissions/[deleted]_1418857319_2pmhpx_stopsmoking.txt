Oh shit! The holidays mean drinking and being around a bunch of people?

I managed to quit by getting rid of all the things that make me want to smoke. I stopped drinking (does it every time), stopped smoking weed (every time), and I've actually been pretty anti-social too because most of the people I know smoke.

Now Christmas time is coming, which for me means I'll be around a lot of people who are drinking. It would be easier to not drink (and therefore not smoke) if I hadn't gotten so used to being alone lately, because I'm going to really want something to take the edge off. Plus there are the people I've always smoked weed with when we get together.

I'm thinking I need a zero tolerance policy on everything, otherwise I could find myself smoking again in 2015. (Which is a big deal -- my badge says 18 days because I messed up, but I've been more-or-less off of cigarettes since September.)

Anyone else facing anything like this?

I'm back

The last cigarette I had was Tuesday morning. For a couple days prior to that, I just wasn't actually enjoying smoking, so when I ran out of cigarettes Tuesday morning, I decided it was a good time to quit. So now it's been two days and almost seven hours. I'm not enjoying this, but I'm determined to stick with it. I'm using the Smoke Free app and texting all my badges to my partner, my best friend, and a coworker. I'm also using meditation apps to help me relax when I start feeling too aggro. Anytime I feel a really strong urge to smoke, I go outside and eat skittles.

I'm having surgery in six months and I'm required to quit smoking for at least two weeks prior to the surgery. That is helping me stay on track right now because since I have to quit in the next six months anyway, it would really suck to have to go through the initial withdrawals more than once!

I'm looking forward to saving money, not feeling dependent on a substance, and not being self-conscious about smelling like cigarettes.

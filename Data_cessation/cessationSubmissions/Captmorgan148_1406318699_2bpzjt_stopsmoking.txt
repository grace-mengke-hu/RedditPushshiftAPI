hope this can get someone through another day

To everyone struggling with this it's okay. It took me about 2 years of actually trying to quit going a month or two at a time and falling off. Never beat yourself up too much about it, it's a huge event trying to overcome smoking. The thing that you must remember when quitting is that it is going to suck, a lot! It wont be easy and it is going to be draining mentally and physically. You must remember why you are doing this, remind yourself this everyday and try to hold on to how you felt when you decided to quit. Apart from trying to curve physical cravings with gum, lemon drops, ect. the real struggle is the mental aspect, for me at least. I constantly questioned myself asking if I really wanted this, if I was making the right decision during the first few weeks. Your cravings will come and go in waves, in the beginning they will last longer and be stronger, but the more you fight through them the easier they will be to overcome. Always remember they will go away, and you can beat them! At first denying cigarettes is painful and leaves you craving, yet after a while it becomes empowering to start to turn people down and say you don't smoke anymore. It's a day by day process of rebuilding yourself and it can only take effect if you want it to.

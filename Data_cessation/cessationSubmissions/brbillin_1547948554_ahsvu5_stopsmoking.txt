Opportunity to quit smoking, looking for advice

Iâ€™m a long time lurker of this subreddit. I (21F) have been smoking for 2 years now. I have struggled to quit smoking in the past, but I recently saw a good opportunity to try again. I tested positive for the flu yesterday, having symptoms one day before. I have not smoked in 2 days now, as my last cigarette sent me into a coughing nightmare. Being afraid of triggering another coughing fit, I have not had as much of an urge to smoke. I just want to get well, and I know that smoking will only prolong my discomfort.  While I am on a 2 day streak of no smoking, I plan to continue this streak and quit smoking for good. I do have concerns about my quitting, though. I have extreme anxiety, if I am not smoking I am picking at my skin or chewing on my fingernails. I have a bad habit of chain smoking when I am stressed or upset. I worry that cutting smoking out of my life will worsen my anxiety and I will find another bad habit to replace it. I also live with 3 other people who all smoke, and smoke inside of the house. Living with people who smoke around me constantly has made it very hard for me to resist cigarettes in the past. I am looking for any advice, tips, tricks, or anything that can help me break the habit and lessen my anxiety.

My last cigarette was on June 21st.

On that day I happened upon [this video](http://youtu.be/RP1ykPUTk_Q)  submitted by /u/laboratorian.

Edit: I changed the link after finding a working video on YouTube. It's still in English but has non-english subtitles.

Now I know that our brains don't all work the same, and maybe I'm just very susceptible to suggestion, but this video changed, in a *very* fundamental way, the way I think about cigarettes.


In the past I was able to quit smoking for about 3 months cold turkey, and almost 6 months after using Snus for a couple months. The cravings always came back though, and I would eventually cave to them and then hate myself for being weak.


After watching this video, I still have occasional cravings, but they're so weak compared to what they used to be, and I can easily overcome them just by confronting them head-on and telling myself something along the lines of "you know it will taste absolutely disgusting and won't help you with the stress at all anyway." And then I'm over it.


I guess why I'm trying to say is that the way smoking and nicotine addiction is explained in that video makes it incredibly easy for my rational, logical mind to overcome the irrational, emotional cravings. I can definitely see this as a permanent change, and I urge everyone to go watch that video if you haven't yet seen it.

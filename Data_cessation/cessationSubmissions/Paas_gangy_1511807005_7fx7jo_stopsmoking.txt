I think I have found the underlying psychological trigger for relapsing even when I have no nicotine left in my system.

This is quite personal and may not apply to everybody, I hope still it inspires somebody even a few or a single person.

Recently I posted on my voice loss because of smoking.

I believe in a concept named chakras, they are supposed to be some nebulose wheels of energy through the body. I believe they are the main centers of somatization.

One of them is located on the throat. It feels good when comunication flows and feels weird (akward, aching, smothered, blocked, tight) when comunication is not flowing or when you are not telling truth or at least not your personal truth.

This wont lead to disease pers√©. It can lead to coping mechanisms. Such as smoking imo. 

I had this revelation as i was thinking I smoke because my life is shit and it helps to cope with shit. I was also thinking earlier, my life is shit because I don t say what I have inside. 

Could be that smoking is a oral fixation? Since I don t tell what I have in mind I breath deeply and exhale smoke because I am too afraid of talking?

Nicotine wont help, sure. But, hey, i might have to practise radical honesty or something because I seriously have speaking out issues:

- I avoid sounding smart to have friends.
- I never say politically incorrect things dispite I really believe some.
- I am too apologetic and avoiding.
- I speak softly because my real voice is too deep and manly.
- I have on occasions avoided to speak out in defense of the weak.
- I dont want to mention talking girls.
- I constantly agree to keep friends.
- At times I could have said I love yoj and never did, I wish I could cry now.
- Being ambiguous to protect myself.
- Above all. Smoking so I can start a conversation :( with other smokers and make friendshipness.


Smoking is cowardice. And my cowardice comes from the lack of honest speech. I dont measure my value as a man by strenght, muscle, money or popularity. I do it by speech: it may not sound like in english, in my language I can be quite eloquent. And I am ruining it by smoking.

I am only lying to myself. This whole issue with communication is nothing but being unauthentic and disrespectfull to who I am and how I should stand. Smoke is not protection.

I hope this helps somebody. If not I am open to your opinions.

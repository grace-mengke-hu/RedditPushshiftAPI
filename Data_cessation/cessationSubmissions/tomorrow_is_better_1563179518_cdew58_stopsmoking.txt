I quit this morning. Didn't take smokes to work. Not a single craving yet, I am surprised

I thought today would be awful at work going cold turkey. I am alone at work this week so there is nobody from who I can bum a smoke when the cravings hit.

Four hours in and still no cravings, feeling good! For a first time in a long while I feel like I can actually do this!

Any positive stories from quitting using Vareniclune (Champix/Chantix)?

I've currently got a initiation pack of Champix. I've not started taking them yet however will be starting today after I've slept to thus make my quit date 22/02/2018.

I want to quit and obviously speaking to my GP and getting this prescription has been the first step. Also a clinic I have to go to has told me I need to quit this year for my treatment to progress faster.

I also like the idea of saving Â£200 a month. 

I just worry because I've been smoking for over a decade and I've got into the habit of having a cigarette as soon as I wake, as soon as I am on break at work and just generally to divide my day up.

Has anyone got any success stories which they would like to share using Champix? Or any insight to dealing with habitual side of smoking and coping with that?

I'd be grateful so I can prepare ready for 22/02/2018.

Any app suggestions that have helped would be great too

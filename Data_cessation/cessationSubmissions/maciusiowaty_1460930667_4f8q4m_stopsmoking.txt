I just quit smoking

Hello, im 17 years old ex-smoker who was smoking for 4 years.

Tomorrow im going to boarding school and that's where are my worries.

My plan is to take a little amount of moneys (5-10$) only for drinks and maybe some snacks to not afford cigs, on school breaks i'll camp under my class and wont go with friends outside (at least for first weeks)

Im actually in home and wasnt smoking for whole 2 days.

I need some tips how i can not go smoke with my roommates (all of them are smoking)

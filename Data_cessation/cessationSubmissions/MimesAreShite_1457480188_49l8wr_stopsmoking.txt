43 days, apparently

Just came here because I actually lost count of how long it had been. For the first week or so I counted in hours. After that, days. Today I realised I had forgotten how many weeks it had been. I love that smoking is slipping further and further from the front of my mind (a place where it was lodged for about the first month), and is become more and more cemented as 'something I used to do', rather than something I am trying to give up.

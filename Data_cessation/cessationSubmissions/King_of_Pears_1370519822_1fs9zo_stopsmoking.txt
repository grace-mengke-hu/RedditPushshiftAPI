Thoughts on 100 days

Thought I'd throw stuff out there about how things are going after 100 days, particularly in terms of symptoms as there has been a lot of discussions around those. It's not been as bad as I thought for cravings, thought please note I'm still on NRT, so may not be quit quit. 

**The Good**

* Exercise is becoming easier, in that it's painful, but a less painful kind of pain. The sort of wholesome, muscle aching, sweat slicking pain of exertion rather than the pallid, gasping, throttled effort of fighting through smoking. 

* Libido is building up (or coming back?). Like, a lot. I can't remember when I last had such a feeling of raw, primal lust when I was smoking. It's amazing.

**The Bad**

* Mega mucus. A million tons of mucus. I feel like [this fucker](http://i.imgur.com/pn2LyW2.png) is loose around my sinuses and likes the place so much he's invited all his friends in to crash. Literally all the colours and flavours of mucus are present in various quantities, tones and qualities. I could open a mucus emporium to suit all seasons and personalities. My favourite is the colourless yet cloying proto-mucus, though I have to say the ball of sticky, green glob makes me fondly remember Melf's Acid Arrow from the original D&D.

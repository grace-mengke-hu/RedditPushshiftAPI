Thanks for all the encouragement yesterday!

Back for another post to say thank you so much for all the encouragement yesterday. I've been really grouchy all day haha, so reading your comments is getting me through. :) 

I woke up with a serious crick in my neck. Which kind of helps because I know smoking would have been annoying today anyway. It's Saturday though and Saturday is clean the house day and concentrating on cleaning is helping me put smoking from my mind. 

Cleaning is good but one of the things I miss the most about smoking (even a year into my quit I missed smoking) because it's a time to be still in the day. To go outside where it's quiet, maybe have a cup of coffee and just turn my brain off for a few minutes. After quitting I'd take my coffee outside and that was nice but it wasn't as good as smoking. Has anyone incorporated other quiet, five to ten minute breaks in their day that have nothing to do with cigarettes?

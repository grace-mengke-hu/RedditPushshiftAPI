22 and a brand-new nonsmoker. Fellow longtime lurkers: Stay subscribed!!!

Almost 24 hours down and I feel so good right now. This community has helped me find the motivation I always knew I had but couldn't muster up.

Backstory: I was (feels so good to type "was") a smoker for about 4 and a half years. I picked it up my freshman year of college for fun and never really thought about it as a problem--I was around smokers all the time and it just felt normal, something my friends and I just did without questioning. By the time I was 20 I always had a pack on me but I always found reasons to not think of it as addiction. Told myself I would quit when I graduated, just kind of assuming that I would automatically wake up the day I finished college and not want to smoke anymore.

Fast forward over a year now, I've been at a "real" job in a new city away from all of my smoking friends but was still stuck on 5 American Spirits a day. Told myself at first that I didn't smoke enough to be worried about it, then I got bronchitis in both lungs on a miserable rainy weekend and still walked down 5 flights of stairs every few hours to smoke. Told myself I was too young to think about quitting. Signed up here and just read and read without doing anything.

Eventually a light came on for me: it's not that I'm too young, I was smoking to make myself feel like I was young, when it was actually making me feel old. 22 (going on 23) isn't an age I get to redo and I'm going to do it without cigarettes. Bought my last pack this weekend (sick of the kid behind the counter there recognizing me as soon as I walked in and pulling the blue Spirits out without me asking), smoked my last one today, and didn't even think about them until I sat down to right this.

To r/stopsmoking: you guys rock. Every time one of you quits, it inspires a bunch of us lurking here to make that mental leap. And to my fellow lurkers, keep reading--today was my day, tomorrow might be yours.

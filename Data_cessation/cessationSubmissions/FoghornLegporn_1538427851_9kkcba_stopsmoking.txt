Psychological effects can be worse than physical. Quitting made me a psychopath.

Ok so maybe not a psychopath but I did have a serious few weeks of shitstorm.

July 31, I quit nicotine. I was vaping the equivalent of 1.5 packs a day, getting my dopamine fix nearly constantly.

My marriage of 9 months had been less than optimal but I had a lot of pent up resentment that I was trying to mediate and just get through what I thought was some marriage growing pains.

Oh, I was soooo wrong. The irritability of the withdrawl took the gloves off any sugar coating and I let it all out over the course of about 3 weeks now. 

I finally saw a couple doctors and was diagnosed depressed, vit D deficient, and low testosterone. I'm on Wellbutrin now, Androgel, and a high IU Vit D supplement. I'm feeling much better but the damage is done, made my first appointment for the divorce lawyer today.


I guess my warning is to be sure you are healthy and ready when you quit, no telling what this addiction will throw out at you.

Heard a quote today "It's not an excuse, but it sure could be the reason"

Thanks for listening. 2 months FREE.....yay?

Anyone quit drinking to quit smoking?

I am nearly 39 and had my first cigarette at 14. Of my group of friends - I was the only one who wasn't fully addicted by 18. I have definitely smoked my share over the years, but I never crave one unless I am drinking. I would say I average 15 cigs a week. But, I have definitely been stressed out recently and have seen both habits slowly start increasing. I guess Ill have to just quit drinking and kill 2 birds with 1 stone.

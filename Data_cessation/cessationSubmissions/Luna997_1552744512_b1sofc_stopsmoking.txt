Started Zyban today/ tell me your success stories

I started Zyban today, took it this morning on an empty stomach at 9am. I haven't felt any different, is this normal?  
Smoking is affecting my health, so my doctor recommended this. I don't really know what to think about it? Or how it's gonna stop me from smoking. But yeah, not sure if not feeling any difference is normal.

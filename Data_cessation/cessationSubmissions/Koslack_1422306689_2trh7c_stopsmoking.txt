Did you feel the physical effects of smoking?

I always knew, like we all do, that smoking is bad for you. But as we all know, there's a difference between knowing and KNOWING something. 
For me, it was the last few months. I had a cough, and it took months for it to fully go away, and it was one of those bad ones where a fit would involve hacking and wheezing and being unable to breath in.
I've also been noticing a heaviness in my chest that made deep breaths impossible. It's a big reason why I finally found the will to quit for good (41 hours without a cigarette!)

20 days no smoking but still feel guilty :/

I've done 20 days without a cigarette even living in a house with 3 other smokers! I'm on nrt (patches etc) but I have a e cig and it helps a lot.. but I can't stop feeling guilty because it still feels like I'm not completely quitting the habit but the e cig gets me through the day and gives me that hit of nicotine I need especially when I'm around other people I live with who are smoking as I'm constantly around smokers other than when I'm at work. is there anyone else dependant on e cigs or has been? I'm proud I haven't had a cigarette just can't help feeling guilty at the same time :/

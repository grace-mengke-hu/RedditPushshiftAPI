6 days....6 BLOODY DAYS NO DOKHA!.... SO HARD. Gotta stay stronger for Ramadan


It's so bloody hard !!!!

lol I swear it's some crazy drug that's beyond basic human understanding I don't get it ! I posted on here 6 days ago and I was more optimistic than I was now :P lol... Though right now it's not too too bad. Now that Ramadan has started for me (day 2), I hope to cross the 36 day mark of no smoking at least.

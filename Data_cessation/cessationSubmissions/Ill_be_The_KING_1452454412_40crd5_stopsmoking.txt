FINALLY STOPPED!!! Got some questions though...

Hi there.

On 31th of December i smoked my last cig and threw away my last pack. Since then i'm smoke free. It's not much but i'm going strong and i do not have the urge to smoke anymore.

However i'm dealing with some very strange situatin.

Since i quit my life became somehow strange. 
I am feeling super powerful at moments and super dizzy/lethargic at moments too.

Is that normal?

And what concerns me more is that for a few days now i have some constant pressure in my head like my blood pressure is very high. I have a headache in the back of my head in the morning and for the rest of the day my head feels like full of blood and my arms too. Is this normal and when it's going to go away because it's super annoying.
My head gets super red in the gym when i try to squeeze the last couple of reps at every exercise.

Cudos!

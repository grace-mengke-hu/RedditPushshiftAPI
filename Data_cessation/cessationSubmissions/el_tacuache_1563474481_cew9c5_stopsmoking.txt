Broke up with my boyfriend. So angry I want smoke a whole pack but i won’t.

I have five days not smoking so far. We broke up yesterday. Every time I think about how manipulative he is and how crazy he made me feel I want to scream! It’s really making me want to smoke, but then that makes me even angrier. I won’t. It will pass. And so will his memory. He’s just another unhealthy habit I refuse to engage in anymore. Thanks for letting me vent and talk myself out of a bad choice.

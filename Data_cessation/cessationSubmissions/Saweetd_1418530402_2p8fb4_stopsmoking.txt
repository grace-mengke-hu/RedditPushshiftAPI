I smoked my last cigarette on December 8th at 8:30pm

I'm using zyban after attempting numerous times with other methods. I had originally set my quit date for December 15th, but my last cigarette was the end of my pack and I was already in the possession of the zyban, so I thought, why not.

I am happy to say that I have not smoked at all since I quit.. And I have only had cravings once or twice. The hardest part was the nicotine withdrawal but I think I am close to being past that now. I smoked for 19 years.

Just wanted to reach out to this sub because you all seem so supportive and whilst I haven't had a terrible time quitting thus far, the support is always appreciated!

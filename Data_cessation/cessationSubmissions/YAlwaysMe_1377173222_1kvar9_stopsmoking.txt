Does it ever stop?

It's been 200 days today and I feel healthier and happier than ever. I don't feel the need to smoke anymore, all cravings are gone.
Even if I drink, drink too much (which was a bif problem for me in the first few months) or am under severe stress I will not smoke - under no circumstances.

However, there are some times here and there during the week, when I think about smoking. It's neither a craving nor is it disgust. It's more a slightly regretting thought of "oh that's a situation in which you def would have smoked...".

I know I would never take another puff - I know I am on probation for the rest of my life - but I wonder whether these thoughts do ever go away. 

I have spoken to some friends who stopped five and more years ago, and they all said that even after that period of time, sometimes after a good meal in a good restaurant, they think about smoking .

Do you have similar experiences?

This is a tougher journey than I've believed

I want to quit smoking for good but its just provong to be difficult and very demanding.

I'm 24 and been smoking for 7 years. I dont smoke cigarettes but a pipe with tobacco (midwakh) popular in the middle east.

I've been feeling my health dropping the last couple of months and I've attributed it all to smoking. so i decided to quit smoking cold Turkey.

worth mentioning is that i successfully quit smoking twice for 1 month each and then returned back due to my weak will and scoial smoking.

but now i realized all of my freinds dont smoke anymore (some do cigarettes but i dont really crave them). buy the pipe things is all over my house and the craving sometimes is too strong and i feel like my body moves on its own. 

my father and my big sister smoke, so the abundance of it in my house is troubling. i talked to them and they are trying no to smoke infront of me and hide the stuff away. but i sometimes search like a crazy bastard for them and unfortunately do find them.

this struggle started last week, the maximum time w/o a smoke was 1.5 days accordig to an app. And i really hate the rationale behind the craving, i somehow convince myself everytime to smoke. 

i picked up jogging and been doing it surprisingly without stopping for a week. but the smoking is really hitting me hard, making me feel weak and stupid. 

I need any tip possible, ill try the cold shower starting today. hopefully I'll quit for good. god help me.

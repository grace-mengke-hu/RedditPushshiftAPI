Day 3.

I want to cry, rip my hair out, and hurl my own fecal matter at everyone. 

Been a smoker for 8 years, 20-30 cigs a day. I've reached day three of quitting, and I feel like my life has become a parody of Trainspotting since Sunday - minus the hallucinations / weird baby scene. 

The only thing that helps is food and masturbating. It's like I can't get through the day without my genitals or a mars bar in my hand at all times.

I want to smoke a bunch of homemade cigarettes made with Allen Carr's book as rolling paper. I called my dad a dirty pirate hooker today.

Is it supposed to be this hard?

Am I just a giant infant, incapable of dealing with even the slightest annoyances in life without puffing on these death sticks?

I will persevere. 

As Kerouac says, "Go climb that goddamn mountain."

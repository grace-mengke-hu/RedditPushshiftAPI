5 days and cravings are high

I've quit or cut back significantly a few times, this time the cravings are through the roof.  not just today, since day one.  i use nioctine lozenges but not enough.  

i really need to quit for surgeries, surgeries i need.  i also intend on putting the money previously spend on smoking towards a new car, my 20 year old car just doesn't cut it anymore.      

I am motivated just looking for a way through the cravings.  looking for suggestions on cravings

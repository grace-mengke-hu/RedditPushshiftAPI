I just keep not smoking in-spite of myself

I thought when I finally quit it would be two weeks of cravings and thinking having one would be so satisfying and after that it would basically go away and I’d move on. I have found that is not so almost daily I have to choose not to smoke. Even when I give myself permission, while driving, to stop, buy a pack, smoke just one, and throw the rest away... I don’t, I continue on. Even when I found half a cigarette I had saved at some point, I fully gave myself the okay to smoke it because it wasn’t like I had more but instead threw it away and went to bed. I have found that my mind is my worst enemy, highlighting so clearly that this is, indeed, an addiction I’m fighting and for now I have to just keep not smoking. I know it gets better... but I thought that better would happen faster.  I smoked non stop since I was 12... I’m 35. Today I am one month, four days and seventeen hours smoke free. I am totally committed to just keep not smoking until I one day become a non-smoker in mindset AND behavior.

3 weeks in!

So I'm three weeks in and, not wanting to tempt fate it's been quite straightforward oddly.  Lot of cravings but talking myself through them has really helped. Also monitoring the smoke free app is helping. Showing me how much I am saving is blowing my mind. I can honestly say I am now at a point where I have gone the longest time without anything tobacco related in my system. Looking forward to getting to one month.

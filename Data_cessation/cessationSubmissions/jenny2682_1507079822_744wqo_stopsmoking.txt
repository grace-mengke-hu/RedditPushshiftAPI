Help! Feel like death but not giving in!

I signed up with a program to quit. I’m on day 13. My smoking was disgusting. I mean I smoked 2 packs a day AND used lozenges. I think I had nicotine in my system 24/7. I would pop a lozenge in to fall asleep.

I am doing the patch because my doctor said I was probably getting 100+mg of nicotine a day and if I am getting 21mg from the patch my body will adjust better.

I am in a permanent brain fog, can’t concentrate, I want to burst in tears, exhausted but can’t sleep, headaches etc. I feel so out of it-like I have had a few glasses of wine but haven’t drank.

Does anyone know how long this lasts? I am getting scared because of the brain fog.

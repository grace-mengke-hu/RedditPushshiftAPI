I'm quitting next week, how can I help prepare myself?

So i'm planning on quitting next Monday! i'm just wondering if anyone has any tips on getting myself ready to finally quit. I have a few parties this weekend which is where i usually smoke a tonne, so i'm a bit concerned that i'll end up keeping it going. I have such weak will power, but I really want to do this.

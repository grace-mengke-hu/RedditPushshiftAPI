I just read Allen Carr's Easyway

Well, I listened to it on tape. And I didn't get through all of it. After 5 hours comes chapter 40, where he says this is the last cigarette. If you're not sure you will succeed, or if you are not excited to quit, re-read/listen to the book. 

I'm a bit disappointed, because neither of those things apply to me. The book is extremely redundant, and at times, seems patronizing. Has anyone else dealt with this? I'm going to re-listen, in hopes that my opinion changes.

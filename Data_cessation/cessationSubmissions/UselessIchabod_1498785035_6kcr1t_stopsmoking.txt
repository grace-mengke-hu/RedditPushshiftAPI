25 days with no cigarettes

I decided to stop about four weeks ago.  Got the nicorette lozenges and cut back.  Caught a cold and just stopped.  Afterwards I just didn't care about smoking anymore.  Don't get me wrong I've had cravings but not like before when I've "tried" to quit.  All my friends smoke around me I can let it go without asking for even a drag.  Physical reactions attributed to withdrawal are pretty brutal but the battle is mental.  I'm sure this has been said before on this sub but I feel accomplished and set to continue a new life free of cigarettes or tobacco of any kind.  Reading posts on this sub really, truly helped me come to this mental state of leaving the addiction behind despite the stresses of life.  There was even a death in my family 8 days deep and I didn't despair and run back to smoking.  Not sure if this will help anyone out there but thank you all for your positive posts and testimonies that got me to this place of calmness without smoking:)

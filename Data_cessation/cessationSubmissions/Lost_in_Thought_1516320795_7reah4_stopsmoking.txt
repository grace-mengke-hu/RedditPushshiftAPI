3 days in, and I feel liberated

Hello everyone! Smoker for 8 years. Started when I was 20.

I've been wanting to quit for years now - I even found this sub and tried to quit last summer. That didn't work.

I quit again 3 days ago (roughly 72 hours when this post goes live) and have so far had no issues sticking to it. My roommate is with me, my will is well, and oddly enough I'm actually excited about escaping.

It started with a cold snap here a few weeks ago. Going outside to smoke sucked (-10*F at most) so I smoked less and less. We went out on new years, to a club and then a house party the next day, and even though I was enjoying some "extracurricular" things, I still didn't really want to go for a smoke that much. I enjoyed being in the moment at a party or on the dance floor, and didn't want to interrupt that to feed a habit I didn't like anyways.

I realized that after a weekend of partying hard, I still had the original pack I bought on Friday. Not only that, it was half full! Over the next 2 weeks I bought 2 more packs before I finally found myself in the right mindset to drive home from work and just... Not buy a pack.

Then I did it again, and again. And every time it's getting easier. I'm looking forward to being able to enjoy myself in the moment, and not feel like I have to break away to feed a demon. It's liberating. 

Another facet to my story: I worked damn hard to ensure as few people knew I smoked as possible. I'd always been ashamed of it. I teach prek, and never wanted to bring that smell to work. I don't need to worry about that anymore! Woo-hoo!

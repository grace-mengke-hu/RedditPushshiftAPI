How I quit.

Im not sure how long its been over a month maybe. I went on to an E-Cig for months. One  morning before work it broke so I was like fuck it Ive quit. I bought some nicotine gum used about 4 peices in a 2 days and never used it again. It was super easy compared to cold turkey. Good luck reader its so unbelievably worth it and it gets easier with every good decision you make.

Another New Year's Resolution...

Hello! So as the title implies, I've decided to join the quitters! 

I know this is going to sound like just an excuse to keep smoking for the next few days, and it totally is, but I'm planning to wait until after the 1st to actually go cig-free. I've been cutting back for now, basically just trying to break out of my routine and not smoke at my normally scheduled times. Usually, I have 2 on the way to work, 3 over the course of the work day, 2 on the way home, and about another 3-5 between getting home and going to sleep. Now, this morning I was not very successful in breaking my routine because I had both morning commute cigs. It's now almost noon and I've just had my first work day smoke. My immediate goal for today is to not have another (or at least only 1) before I leave for the day, and only 1 on my way back home. Reading some of your posts seems to help, but also reminds me of how badly I want to run outside and have a few drags. Any advice, fellow quitters?

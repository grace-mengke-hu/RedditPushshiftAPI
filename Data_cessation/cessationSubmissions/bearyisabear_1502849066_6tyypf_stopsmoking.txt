Almost 3 days and still feel like crap

Have been smoke free for almost three days and I still feel horrible. Nauseous and can't sleep worth a damn, plus this lump in my throat feeling, like an anxiety feeling kind of lump still comes and goes( not an actual lump and I can breathe just fine). Anyone here experience anything like this? I'm never going back to smoking, feeling this bad isn't worth it and I only smoked for 6 years. I'm just curious to know how long any of these symptoms lasted for anyone else.

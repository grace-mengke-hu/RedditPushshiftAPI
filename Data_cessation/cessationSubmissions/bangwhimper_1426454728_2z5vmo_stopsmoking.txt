I'm Ready to Join -- For Good

I've been smoking for 7 years now. I've tried -- and failed -- so many times to quit. I've been lurking here for about a year now, reading posts, telling myself I was 'building up my confidence to quit.' But I've realized I just have to go for it. That's it. And I'm ready to join this community, because I need to be accountable. Help me hold myself accountable, /r/stopsmoking!

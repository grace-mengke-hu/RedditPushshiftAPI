Has anyone used the Smoke Free app?

It's pretty great. It shows you how much money you are saving on a daily basis and how many years you are adding to your life. It's also a great distraction during cravings because you can log a diary entry until they pass. 

Good luck to all of my fellow NY resolutions people. I am still going strong at the end of day 2!

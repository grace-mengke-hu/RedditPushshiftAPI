Two years since I quit smoking and I can't recognise myself

Hello everyone! I thought that maybe writing about my whole smoking and quiting experience would be of some help to some of the new people here that are just starting the fight. It's a pretty long post in which I tell my whole story. ***If you just want advice*** skip the first big chunk of the post and scroll down. I wish you all power to overcome this. I did it, so anyone can.

***MY STORY***

**As a smoker.**

I am a 25 year old male. I've been smoking since I was 14. It quickly became part of my personality (you know how kids are, wanting to be cool, you start to skate or play the guitar just to be cool, smoking falls right in that category) and quickly came to one pack a day going out with friends drinking and making fools out of ourselves all day, pretending to be cool. It's important to say that both of my parents were, and still are, smokers. My father still sometimes smokes two packs on a bad day. So I was pretty much passively smoking all of my life. Also in my country, back then, smoking in bars, caffes and restaurants was legal, and that didn't help down the road at all. At 16 I've met my current girlfriend (also a smoker) and we're together ever since. We afterwards moved together at 18 to another city for attending university. 

I started studying architecture at university so my social life went downwards because of the shear amout of work. I was almost exclusively socializing with smokers. Also, I was under the impression that smokers were somewhat cooler (so wrong!). Little by little I was entering a narrow psychological space fed by my preconceived ideas and vices (smoking but also drinking almost everyday). Of course, I wasn't realising this. Shitty stuff was happening to me, like old friends we're not keeping in touch with me any longer, my projects we're not going well at all, my relationship with my parents was also degrading. I couldn't figure out the real reason why all of this was happening to me, I thought that maybe this is just the way things were, people drift appart and things are sometimes bound to get shitty ("That's life!" I was saying back then, in a super pessimistic way). I was wrong. By my third year of university I was smoking a lot (a pack of 40g of tabacco for hand rolled cigarettes in less than 1 week sometimes - this was way cheaper than packs - also the low price didn't help back then), drinking beer every evening, eating a lot of junk food and binge watching TV series. I was very depressed, started to think that maybe I did a massive mistake choosing my field of study since it wasn't a pleasure anymore to work on projects. Everything was grey and gloomy and days were just passing by being all the same and boring as hell. Sense and purpose started missing from my life and all I could do was smoke a cigarrette every time I felt bad. 

By my fifth year I had enough. I knew I needed a change. I started to guess what was wrong. I've wanted something to challenge myself so I enrolled in a different design studio of an architecture professor that I totally respected and tried to give my best, to overcome my limitations in design thinking and culture. Things were going slightly better but still something was holding me back, still having the same addictions. Often times I just had to go for a cigarrette when I was feeling super pressured from the competitiveness in the studio and the complexity of some discutions with the teacher and assistants. I knew that I was mentally blocked. My mental space was so narrow and so locked up that I needed a major change in my lifestyle. Luckily enough my girlfriend was experiencing sort of the same thing, and on the 1st of January 2017 we decided to quit smoking. 

**After I quit.**

Since then I've changed a lot. Now, in 2019, after two years, I look back and I wonder how could I do this to myself. I was locking myself up in a cage. 

At first it was horrible since I was so used to lighting one up everytime I felt a bit stressed. I needed a placeholder for a while. So I've started drinking black tea (no coffee, since that was a massive trigger). Everytime I felt pressure and needed some time off I would drink some tea. I've told all of my friends that I quit so that they won't tempt me, offering me cigarettes or smoking next to me. This is super important since all of my socialising was pivoting around smoking. They all understood but slowly I wasn't going out that much. I started to better focus on my work and my studies and I started doing so well I even got a scholarship for my final year of university. 

At home we both started to make changes, pay more attention on the way we are living, eating, just taking care of ourselves and our apartment better. We started to cook our own meals, make healthier decisions regarding diet, paint our walls, buy some furniture and clean up more often. Our relationship became a lot better, we started having long discutions about interesting topics, getting to know each other way better than before.

Just in 2018 I accomplished so many things that before I couldn't see myself do and that I am so grateful for. I travelled a lot, saw some parts of Italy, and lived and worked abroad for 4 months in Vienna. I bought an electric guitar and started to learn how to play it. I started jogging once every two days (doing it even in cold weather, that's a big wow for me). I lost weight since I've also made some changes in my diet such as not eating products with added sugar and avoiding wheat as much as I can. Now I am also trying to quit drinking alcohol. 

Sadly I cannot say that two years ago I had my last cigarrette. Since then I had one brief moment of "fuck it" (when I started working abroad, I was lonely and stressed out and sadly I gave in...), but I've been able to overcome it and now I'm much stronger psychologically.

**What I've learned.**

**Smoking is a prison.** It keeps you locked in a small mental space where your thoughts and feelings are always small and numb. You can't taste life to the fullest while being a smoker. Everything is desaturated, and you're in a constant state of confusion. The ugliest thing is that it messes up your perception. Often times you can't say clearly what's real and what's just in your head and because of this symptoms of anxiety and depression come lurking inside your head and soul. Quiting was the best thing that I could do to change my life for the better. I've come to realise that I didn't know how to live properly, I wasn't feeling the true intensity of emotions and couldn't act on them properly being always stuck in some kind of anxiety. Now I am much more aware and present. Also I am more honest and serious about life. I've lost touch with many friends because of this but the relationships that I still do have with people are of a much higher quality. 

It's important to feel free. Free to express yourself, free to produce thought in a generous mental space. Free to feel reality just as it is, with no false veil of perception produced by your broken, addicted self. **To quit smoking is just this: you are offering yourself freedom.** No one can ever offer it to you, you have to reach out and take it.

**ADVICES**

Have faith that you can do it. After a while it gets easier. I would say that there are definitely some important milestones that mark progress and a change in your overall health and behavior. The first month is the hardest, since this is the time you break from the habit. Then the 3 month mark is like a revelation, you realise that food and coffee taste better, that you're not that tired anymore and many aspects of your life seem more positive. After you realise how better your life is the chances of slipping back into the habit are minimal. So, here are a few things that worked for me personally:

* **If you can, get a friend to quit at the same time and support each other.** This was a big thing for me, since I quit together with my girlfriend. Everytime I craved for a cigarette she was there to talk me out of it and vice-versa. It's like having a sponsor and being one.
* **Quickly create a placeholder.** Quiting leaves a hole in your behavior that needs to be filled. If not, you will return to the habit. It won't go away so easily, you have to push it away. For me the placeholder was black tea. Everytime I craved for a cigarrette I drank a cup of tea. It's so much better to feel the softness and warmth of the tea going down your throat than feeling the toxic taste of tabacco. In time I didn't need to drink so much tea instead since the cravings went away after a few weeks.
* **Let it be known that you QUIT.** Tell your friends, tell your family, tell the internet, tell everyone. Brag about it. It's a big thing you're doing. The world should support you for doing this big great thing for yourself. Also, shame is a very big factor in human behavior and you can make this mechanism work in your favor. After you tell everyone that you quit it would be a real pitty to light one up...
* **Identify triggers and avoid them at all costs.** This is very important, since the habit is very often identified with activities, places, people or times of the day. If you will not avoid triggers you will fall right back in the trap in no time. Make a list, seriously. Take for example the morning coffee. That's a big no-no! Avoid the places you used to smoke. Try to explore, find a new pub or restaurant. When you go out with friends ask them not to smoke or to do it somewhere else (if they are true friends they can do this for you). Avoid drinking! Alcohol was a major trigger for me, especially beer. I switched to wine because of this and in a way smaller quantity than before, I was enjoying the taste also. You'll se that in time your whole behaviour will change because of these avoidances. **The biggest trigger of all is stress.** This is much harder to avoid. But you can do something to avoid this, check out the next point.
* **Build up a general good mood.** This may be tricky because mood is a lot of times contextual. But nothing is more important for motivation than a good mood. Start some new habits that can help you with this. Start eating differently, cut out the junk food that makes you depressed and try something healthier instead, there are a lot of options today. Start working out or going out for a run. There's nothing like those endorfines to help you get in a good mood fast. Even now, whenever I feel down I put on my jogging equipment and go out for a run. By the time I get back I feel like a million bucks, ready to conquer the world (or maybe just finish that tedious task I was postponing for days).
* **Imagine yourself as if you've never smoked, ever.** This is sort of a jedi mind trick. Everytime I would crave a cigarrette I would say to myself "*That's stupid, why would I want that? I never smoked in my life.*" Of course it's a lie but it somehow builds up confidence and helps you resist. I recommend trying this out after the 3 month milestone for mild cravings. Definitely don't try just this at the beginning since you won't be able to play along. 
* **Be mindful and analyze your emotions instead of repressing them.** A big problem when being a smoker is that your perception is totally f\*\*\*d. You get angry and lash out at people for almost no reason. Or you get lazy when you have a complicated task at hand. You get irritated easily for almost nothing. You don't think about it, you just go for a smoke and forget about it. Reality is much different than your deformed representation of it. So, changing your perception is important, but it's one of the last things that you will be able to do in the process of quitting. You probably won't be able to do this easily in the first few months so don't beat yourself up. I recommend just staying alone with yourself for at least half an hour a day thinking about moments when you felt angry, sad or irritated and really get to the core of the thing that made you feel this way. I often realised that my representations were often times wrong and my behavior wasn't justified. Also, you can use guided meditation to help you along the way (apps or other stuff). I also recommend reading some stoic philosophy, especially Marcus Aurelius Meditation (really, look it up, it's cool only to see that even a roman emperor had problems comparable to yours).
* **Learn from the experience of others.** This is basically why I am writing this post. It helped me a lot to read the stories of other people who quit, from this sub and other places. It's useful to build in your head the image of the non-smoker since you haven't been one for a very long time, it's hard to imagine how it is to be this totally different person. It will soon become something you desire: to be more active, to feel better in your skin, to eat healthier, to breath properly, to be able to stay calm, to see things clearly. Often times people's experiences are completely transformative. Realise that you will go through the same changes and your life will change forever for the better. 

All of these being said, I wish you all good luck on your journey if you are just starting, and keep living the awesome non-smoker lives for the ones who have made it. 

Cheers

question regarding teeth/gums/dentist...

Hi everyone! I have a dentist appointment in about a month, and I'm curious, for those who have regular dentist visits (every 6 months or yearly) how did it go? Did the dentist say anything to you? Offer you programs to help quit? How bad did your dental hygiene get? How has it improved since you quit? How long did it take your mouth to get back to normal?

I'm just curious, because I've been a casual smoker for a while now, and my dentist never commented or indicated there were signs of smoking. In fact, he always praised me for healthy teeth and gums. Since I've been smoking a fuckton more in the past year than I ever have in my life, I'm pretty sure this will be the year he says something. 

Just wondering what your experiences have been. Thanks!

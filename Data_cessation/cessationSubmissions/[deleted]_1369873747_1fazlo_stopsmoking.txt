5 days.

Things are past the really bad part.  At least I would like to think so.  Nothing new to say I guess.  Just taking up ink on the net.  My sense of humor isn't where I would like it yet.  I'm so serious about stuff.  I would get so upset easily last week.  I hope that's all behind me.  I am back to my regular sleeping pattern.  God still loves me.  My lungs are starting to clean themselves out.  At least I hope.  They sure are taking their time with it.  I felt like killing people days ago.  MY thoughts are still scattered.   I avoid Facebook.  I avoid a lot right now.  I am not taking any chances.  Yesterday I worked 13 hours.  It felt really good.  I couldn't have done that 4 days ago lol.  I like to ramble.  As long as I am going in the same direction that I was 5 minutes ago then it's the right direction.  Who cares if anyone reads this.  No, it's cool if you are and I appreciate it.  I hope that you pull some inspiration out of this or take something away from it.  It just helps me to get it out and see it in front of me.  This is more or less my throwaway account anyway.  I am sort of ashamed of the smoking habit that I had.  I hated it.  I never liked doing it in public.  I did but I still hated it.  I hid it.  Anyway, that was the past.  The future is a much better place and always will be.  I"ll make sure of it.

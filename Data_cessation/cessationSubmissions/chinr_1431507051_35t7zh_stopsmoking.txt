Odds of staying quit and how to improve them

Everyone is probably aware that the chances of successfully quitting smoking are pretty bad at the start of a quit but once you've been quit for a while it starts to be more likely that you'll stay quit rather than relapse. I was wondering where the tipping point is so I'd have something to aim for and found this paper (http://whyquit.com/studies/1992garvey_lapseequalsrelapse_95_percent.pdf ) which had a few findings that I thought I'd share in case it helps motivate people. 

First off, us self quitters start all this with a mountain to climb. In the study above 49% relapsed in the first week, 62% in the first two weeks, 76% in the first month. So if you've got yourself to the one month mark you've beat the odds and things start to calm down a bit. Give your self a pat on the back. 

But it's not over yet. In the study there were 57 people still abstinent at 1 month but only 30 of those would make it to the finish line without smoking. Just over 50%. If you can make it to a month you're just a coin toss away from being smoke free for good! (almost).

By the end of the year long study 87% of the original group had relapsed, but we all knew it was hard. 

But what we all want to know is what did the 30 people who made it through have that the others didn't? 

Your longest previous quit attempt was a factor. So keep trying and keep learning. Attitude made a big difference, those who knew they would do it did it. No surprise that increased alcohol consumption was associated with relapse. Social environment also matters, not a single person with a smoking spouse and a social circle of mainly smokers stayed quit. Finally, reflecting the conventional wisdom round here, almost everyone who smoked at all after quitting ended up in a full relapse, so I'm afraid you really can't have just one. 

Obviously, this is just one study. What else do you think helps to stack the odds in your favor?

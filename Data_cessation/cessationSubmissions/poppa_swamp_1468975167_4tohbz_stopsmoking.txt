Day 2...

Holy shiet. Forgot what it was like to quit. My mind feels foggy as hell - I'm fatigued and can't concentrate. If this doesn't clear up by the time school starts I'm screwed. And my eyes keep watering up and I could just ball my eyes out for even the smallest sad thought. 



Day 2 without nicotine. I've been off of cigarettes for a couple months - finally dropped the e cig. These fucked up withdrawals remind me why I need to get over this addiction. I thought that my e cig was healthy enough and I wasn't doing myself any harm. It's gunna be a long road and a lot of rewiring, but I know it'll be worth it. Good luck everyone.

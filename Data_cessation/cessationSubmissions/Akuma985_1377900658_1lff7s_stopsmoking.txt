ok I'm nearly two weeks in and...

ok first off don't mind the badge since I had a smoke two days ago and I reset it.

I used to smoke 20 cigs a day for over 15 years. I'm In since 19 August and to this day I smoked just two cigarettes. I feel in total control of the carvings, I can make them easyly go away by doing pushups, or running, or eating something extra (it's ok beacuse I am bit under my right BMI).

the problem is I noticed that carvings are not diminishing and I fell I had no major changes in my life since I quit. My breath is still bad (no more smokey but bad), I'm always tired, i have short breath. What's going on? is it normal?

2 Weeks! Hoozah~

30 minutes away from 2 weeks and a day. I still get cravings but they last as long as it takes me to say F*** That. I've sold my tobacco plants (I loved my own blends). Champix worked amazing too. Absolutely no side effects on my end but I may have cheated by prepping for the side effects *(thank you med school)*. Here's my 2 weeks log. Copy pasta'ed from my end of day log ~notepad~. Bold is recollection.

1. Meh this is easy. What's all the fuss about?

2. SWEET MOTHER MARY WHAT A FUCKED UP DAY. F*****g CRAVES. **<- I almost went mad here**.

3. Niece's birthday. Had lots of drinks. Resisted Smoking. **<- This definitely helped to make it easier to live normally without dodging any smoke triggers**

4. Easy day. Some stress, no urge. Went out and got thoroughly wasted. Did not even ask for a puff. 

5. Getting used to not smoking. Habitual cravings from post-meal & Sunday boozing. Did not give in **<- Thank you Day 3**

6. Heavy craving after paying for car repair bill. **<- Day 2, BMW + Flood = Tears**. Developed rageful chewing gum habit.

7. Car's back, weather was good, hit 1 week. Stress free day. No crave after meal.

8. Drank with clients. They smoked a lot. Felt like slapping them. Smelt so good freshly burnt but smelt absolute shit in between their smokes. 

9. Drank with clients again. Craving was strong today. First victory drink without cigarettes. Felt weird, but breathing well was a motivator. 

10. Drank with friends. I have amazing friends. Chain smokers did not smoke the entire 5 odd hours of heavy boozing.

11. Launch event. Had 5 rocks worth of amazing Islay Whisky. This triggered the living hell out of my craves. But the amount of taste coming out of the Whisky that I've never tasted before was enough to kick the crave to the curb **<- I'm an avid Islay drinker. Have always associated it with tobacco.**

12. DINING IN THE DARK! I AM SO DAMN GLAD I STOPPED SMOKING. Called out a huge part of the ingredients correctly. Herb to Vege to Meat to Fish Types. Smokers have no idea what they're missing out on! Had dessert and some sweeetttt Kronenbourg beer. Tasted even more of what I didn't taste before.  **<- My last day of cravings. This very event single handedly destroyed all my cravings. It was eye opening**

13. Swam today. 20 laps of pure goodness. No crave.

14. Cycling machine today. Managed 3.5 KM in 5 minutes and 8 laps of running in the pool. No crave.

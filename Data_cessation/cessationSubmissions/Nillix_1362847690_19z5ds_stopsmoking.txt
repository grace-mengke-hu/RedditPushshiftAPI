Surprise Cravings 

So it's been a little over two months for me. New Years quitters, go!  Anyway, last night I was having dinner with a friend, and suddenly I got an intense craving that lasted for almost an hour. Haven't had one that bad in almost six weeks. Is that a common occurrence for people? I didn't cave, but it caught me a little off guard.

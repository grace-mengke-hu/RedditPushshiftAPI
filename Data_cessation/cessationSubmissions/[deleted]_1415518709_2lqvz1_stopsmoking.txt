I done messed up.

Hey /r/stopsmoking,

I just found you guys and I could use some support. 

I quit smoking in December of 2012 and other than a few slips here and there, I've been able to stay quit. However, my girlfriend and I broke up last Friday and I smoked a cigarette that night. Then I smoked one the next night, and then again on Tuesday. On Thursday night, I bought a tin of Skoal and then I dipped maybe 10 times since then. (Throughout my tobacco use I used cigarettes and dip interchangeably) I don't want to get sucked back into this and so I'm hoping that by posting here I will summon some motivation.  

As a sidenote, I've also been sober for a little over 2 years and I know that these kinds of behaviors could precede a relapse and I really would like to avoid that. By reaching out to you all, I feel like I'm taking a step towards correcting my behavior and hopefully you can help me get on the right path. I just flushed the remainder of tin of Skoal down the toilet. Hopefully I stick with it tomorrow.

Thanks for reading.

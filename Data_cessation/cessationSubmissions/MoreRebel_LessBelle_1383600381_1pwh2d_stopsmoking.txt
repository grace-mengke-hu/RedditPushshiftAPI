Smoke free campus :)

Over the weekend, I was teaching a class at a college campus. On my way out of the parking garage I saw a sign saying it was a smoke-free campus. 6 days ago (before becoming a non-smoker) this sign would have made me feel angry, anxious, and like an outcast. Now, though, this sign made me feel happy, relieved, and societally-accepted. Yay :)

Analogy for quitting process

Hi,
With all the information i've bombarded myself to i think i came up with an analogy that best describes this period (at least for me). Its like installing a rather large software on your computer. There is an estimated time information but its not reliable. so you dont really know when the installation will be complete. During the installation , you constantly get exceptions (errors). If you react the installation is almost always is interrupted and you have no choice but to start over. Then you learn by experience and from others experiences that all you gotta do is to ignore the errors. It wont have any effect over the installation process. The error messages doesnt tell much. they just keep popping up on the screen with some goofy looking symbols. You dont know why they keep popping up but its just that you want to click on them to close cause they are annoying. The cravings are not as intensive as it once was but this helps me alot. Just wanted to share

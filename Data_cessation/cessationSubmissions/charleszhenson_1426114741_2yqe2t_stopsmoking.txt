Been lurking here for quite a while and have made a decision...

I'm going to quit. My grandpa is in the hospital for heart stuff. This reminded me that heart disease runs on both sides of my family. I've started exercising the past few days and think I can make exercise a habit that replaces smoking. 

I've tried quitting before and have failed. I'm hoping that this is it but have no idea if I'll make it or not. 

What do I do to ease cravings? I've heard things about mood swings and a larger appetite. What works and what myths do I need not worry about? Does it help to tell anyone or should I tell as little people as possible?

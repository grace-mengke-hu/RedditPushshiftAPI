Turned 18 today.

Today I turned 18.  
    For the 5 years that I have been in a relationship with cigarettes, I looked forward to this day as when I could purchase my first legal pack of death.
    Well I walked into my local supermarket this afternoon and purchased the first step program of nicotine transdermal patches.
     I am making a vow, not only to myself, but to my family and friends that have witnessed my struggle with nicotine addiction.
     I am making a vow to be able to rid my body of the toxic impurities that i have ignorantly been pumping into it.
    I know that 2 hours is a small feat for most, but to me it is the first step to being able to smell, taste, and enjoy all the scents and food that I once loved.
 I am 18 years old.  I am making a choice, not for anyone else.  I am making a decision that will benefit me from this day forward.  I am free.

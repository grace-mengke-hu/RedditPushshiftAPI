Reset my timer 4 times today

I've been smoking fulltime since I was 13, I'm 35 now. Honestly, quitting scares the shit out of me. I made it 17 hours, but the urge to smoke in the morning is just brutal. It is finals week, and the idea of sitting through 3 hour symbolic logic lectures craving is not appealing. I'm going to stop again tonight, wish me luck. I didn't figure a forum would be a support system I could embrace, but it is awesome seeing everyone giving it an honest try. (Also, QuitNow! Pro doesn't look as cool as the IOS apps. ;-])

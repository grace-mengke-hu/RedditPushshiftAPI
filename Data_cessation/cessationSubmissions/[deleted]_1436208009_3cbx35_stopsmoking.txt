silencing that little voice

Hi everyone! I'm subscribing to this subreddit with hope that reading it daily will help me in my quitting quest. I have only been smoking since May, but my dad died of lung cancer so the guilt and anxiety it causes me is a big factor in wanting to quit. I feel like my biggest challenges in not smoking is the ready availability of cigarettes when I am at my boyfriend's place and when I am out for drinks with friends. Also, going out for a smoke is so romanticized in my mind that I always want to go and do it. I've always had a bit of an issue with that "little voice" telling you, it's no big deal, just do it" So i am hoping to learn to silence it through quitting smoking. Any advice at all is welcomed.

Still difficult at time

So it's been a little over a month of being smoke free, nothing, nada not even a single puff. It has gotten much much much easier. Most days I don't even get even the slightest craving. However, once a week or so I get this overwhelming desire to smoke a cigarette. I say desire not craving because it's just that. It's not a craving I don't need to smoke I just keep thinking/feeling man it would be great to have a smoke right now. Anyone else have similar urges or any words of advice? I don't fear relapse just looking for help dealing with this annoyance.

Almost One Week In...

Smoked for nearly 6 years; this is my second time trying to quit.  
  
I had no intention of really quitting. I'm kinda just rolling from 'Eh I'll buy a pack tomorrow morning'. So I basically stopped from pure laziness. This time, completely different from the last, has been nearly a breeze. Although, I've been avoiding catching up on Mad Men and Boardwalk.  
  
Cool things to note: 1.) I smell like my body wash - ALL DAY LONG.  And my room is beginning to air out and smell like damn candles.  
2.) My breathing is getting better every day.    
3.) I don't wake up with a sore throat and shitty taste in my mouth.  
4.) Mo $$$.

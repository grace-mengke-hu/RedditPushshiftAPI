Reset my quit date

Really struggling. I don’t seem to have a problem not smoking when I’m with friends, going hiking all day long - as long as I’m busy. It’s just when I’m home alone or in awkward situations like dates that are boring. Seems like I use smoking to connect with people when I usually wouldn’t want to connect with them otherwise - ie. boring first dates, negative coworkers. Aaaarhh!

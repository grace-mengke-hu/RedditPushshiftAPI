I will stop smoking — then end up having one or few when drunk. How can I end this mindset of it isn’t that bad every now and then?

I have gone 4 days no smoking. I feel good. No need for a smoke. Cravings here and then but I can overcome them.

Now I do this ALL the time lol, stop smoking for 5 days then the weekend hits, I go out with some friends and half the people smoke, I end up having one when I’m outside chatting to a friend because I think, what’s a few gonna do on the weekend really? But really smoking altogether is bad so I need to find that way of not smoking when drunk. Any tips?

3 Posts in One Day - I know - Shut Up Already

Off Topic

So... I do laundry like every 3 days. I can't stand the smell of cigarette smoke on clothes, so I never wear anything twice. (Not kidding: I announced on FB that I quit smoking and someone said; I never knew you smoked?!)

The point being and I know I'm rambling, I spent the entire day doing laundry. Why? Because I've not done laundry for 2 weeks! Because my clothes don't stink! So I didn't do laundry until I was getting short on underwear and socks. I'm saving water and electricity too!

Now after I spend a small fortune on dry cleaning, I'm really going to be saving money. I just noticed when putting away the clothes and all my nice 'dry clean only' stuff smells like a thrift shop. 

Not ADHD!, but another perk, is that I enjoyed ironing today. I put a little lavender in the water bottle and everything I ironed smells delicate.

I'm done.

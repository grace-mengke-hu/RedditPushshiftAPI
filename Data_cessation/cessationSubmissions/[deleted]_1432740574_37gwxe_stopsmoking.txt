Travel. Smoking. What's the connection? I feel like a different me with no accountability. Dangerous.

I'm posting on this again just to keep me straight. I've done 9 solid days of non-smoking, doing quite well. Day 1 in the Big Apple went pretty well but Day 2 is going a bit tough, especially first thing this morning. Why does travel make me want to smoke? The stress? The excitement? Funny, but I think it is the fact that I just feel like a different me when I travel, with no accountability. Dangerous.

I know, don't smoke, I get it. No excuses. But I struggle. I will be okay, but I struggle. Writing this helps. Any feedback welcome.

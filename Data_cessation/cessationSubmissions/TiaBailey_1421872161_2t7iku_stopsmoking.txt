10 days & counting but struggling

Hey, well I'm coming to the end of my 10th day & I'm quite proud of myself. The physical cravings haven't been too bad after about day 4 but I'm struggling mentally now in that I'm missing it - well the feeling of fitting in - most of my friends smoke you see & I'm missing the little catch ups over a cig. I also dont feel any better for quitting 2 days after stopping I came down with the worst cold i've had in months & have still got it. So i'm struggling a bit to stay motivated any ideas?

Screw the patch, I've been doing better without nicotine.

The patch help me stop smoking for a few months about a year ago, so I decided I'd try it again. On the second day, the thing fell off after about 6 hours and I decided not to use it any more. 

I've found cold-turkey to be even easier to manage than the crutch that is the patch. The cravings for nicotine won't start until the nicotine flow stops, and the patch seems to postpone the one thing you're trying to break free from. 

So far everything is good. I've been riding my bike every day, eating healthier, and spending time making improvements to my home. Rather than "filling the void", I've thought of it more as "look at all this extra time I have to get stuff done". 

Just wanted to share. Thanks for reading.

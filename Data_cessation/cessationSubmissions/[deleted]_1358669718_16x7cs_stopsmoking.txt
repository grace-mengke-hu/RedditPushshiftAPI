Quit smoking 8 hours ago.

20 January 2013 . I hope I can resist the first 72 hours. Wish me luck.

Edit 1 : I'm very calm and not a bit anxious about my decision.I already feel better. Thanks for your support.
Edit 2 : Found this [site!](http://www.quitmeter.org/main/page/zhinn) and it's a plus for me and my girlfriend is supporting me too. I wish you all good luck.

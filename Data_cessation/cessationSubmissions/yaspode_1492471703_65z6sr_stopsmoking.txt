Been in a bar tonight...

...where smoking is allowed. Sat there for two hours with four smokers in a serious discussion. Didn't want to smoke at all. I came home with a head splitting headache and reeking of smoke. I don't remember what it feels like to want to smoke anymore after smoking a pack a day for 16 years. The cravings have completely vanished now, no more nostalgic thoughts about smoking, just sadness about waiting so long. Not drinking alcohol anymore since January really helped to stabilise the quitting process as well as never taking a cigarette into my hand or mouth since September. 

So stay focused, everyone and thank you for all the input in this sub. It really helped me many times through a hard day to read your quitting stories and learn from your successes and failures.

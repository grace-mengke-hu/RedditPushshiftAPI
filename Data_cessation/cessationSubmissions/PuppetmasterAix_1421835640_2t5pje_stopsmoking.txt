Let's do this - Day 8

As of now i haven't had a cigarette for 6 days, 13 hours and 41 minutes. And it is getting much easier. My subconsious has given up on trying to trick me into smoking, it is also no longer the first thing i think about when i wake up. My routine used to be, wake up, put on pants, go outside for a smoke, then do the shower, breakfast, go to work stuff. Now it's wake up, stay in bed for a few minutes enjoying the fact that nothing is pushing me to get up right this minute, then shower, etc.

I have also stopped using the nicotine spray, because a) it really is disgusting and b) i don't want to get addicted to it. I was afraid that i go through this fight of quitting smoking only to then have to go through it again to quit the spray.

Anyways I am feeling good today, let's not smoke today!

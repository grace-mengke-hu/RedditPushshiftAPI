Vaping

So I have quit for the first time in 15 years, I am on my 4th day cold turkey.
This sub has been extremely helpful so thanks!
My plan is to get completely off nicotine but when it comes to drinking/going out I know this will be the hardest part for me so I want to get a vape with nicotine free oil just for nights out.
Has anyone done this and does it fill the void at all?

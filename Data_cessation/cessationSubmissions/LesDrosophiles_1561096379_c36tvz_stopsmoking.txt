I did it, 25 days. WTF, I did while through work meltdowns and hard times with my SO. Every Day is good news!

This has been one hell of a rollercoaster, everything that had to go wrong took it's toll on me. I am 50 yo, smoked for at least 35 years. Guess I owed a lot of rollercoaster time. Anyways, hang on everyone! Every Day is good news!

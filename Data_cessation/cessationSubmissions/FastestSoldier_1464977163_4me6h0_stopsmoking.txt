First week completed

This week has been pretty easy. The first and second day is as usual pretty bad, but apart from that I've had very few cravings during this week. 

I've been crushing many triggers, but I still got a lot to overcome. Including the worst one, alcohol. The worst day for me was probably day 4 as I just couldn't sleep that night. I also didn't eat well that day. This is on of my worst triggers when little sleep and little food are combined and where it would always felt good with tobacco. But I pulled trough. I remember all the times in the military on exercises where we ate little and slept little and tobacco would be the most precious thing on earth. Apparently nicotine activates the flight or fight hormone which release carbs and fat into the bloodstream to be burned. That's why it helps when you're hungry.   

Remember to eat well and regularly, drink lots of water and do a little bit of physical exercise each day. Helps a lot.

Re smoking

I’m 54. Quit again. Now 15 days. 
My observation; there is not a single smoker who honestly does not wish he or she can quit for good; on the flip side however, every ex smoker every now and then has thoughts of how nice it will be to have just one……
That is the curse of nicotine addiction!!!!!
Be strong myself.

I decided to quit smoking!

I've been smoking for the last 6 months and finally decided stopping it! Generally I smoke about 4 cigarrets dailly (I buy tobacco and silk then make my own cigarrets). The date I chose for definitively stopping is january 10.

I hope this subreddit helps me, I'll follow it from now. I'm also using the app "Quit Smoking", which is a Free Software (free as in freedom) and is available at F-Droid. Good luck for us all!

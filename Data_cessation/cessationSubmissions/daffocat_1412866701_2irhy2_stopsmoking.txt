20 days and having light headed, dizzy and vague episodes.

Has anyone else had light headed, dizzy and vague episodes? I expected to have light headedness the first couple of days after stopping but its day 20 now and I am getting worried that I am some sort of brain problem. It comes on without warning and it happens a few times a day at the moment. Yesterday I had to lie down at work because I though I was going to pass out. I am eating fine, having fruit, lots of water etc. Some advise would be much appreciated.

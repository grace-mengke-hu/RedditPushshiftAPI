Something dumb I tried that actually helped me!

So, I know this is going to sound dumb, but hear me out!

 I found one of the really relaxing parts of smoking is it forces you to slow your breathing. You cannot take quick deep breaths, but are forced to suck air through a small tube, right? So, what I did: I cut and filled a regular soda straw up with cotton balls I took from Q-tips.  I filled it until it had a similar draw as cigarette. Whenever I have really intense cravings, I just simply take a draw of my "cigarette" for 5-10 minutes while I'm driving or on break. You just gotta make sure that the cotton doesn't come out into your mouth; I actually used a cigarette filter I had to prevent that but you could probably be more creative than me :) 

It obviously doesn't feel identical, but it does force you to suck air through a small tube like a cigarette and does allow you to keep your hands busy! It sounds dumb but the slowed-breathing and oral fixation really helped me, maybe it could help you too! Just an idea I had :) Cheers.

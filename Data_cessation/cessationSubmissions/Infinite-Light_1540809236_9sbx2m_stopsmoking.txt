How do I unsubcribe to the Smoke Free app? I didn't realise it was costing me money

I realised I was paying 99p a month for it. I don't actually need this app anymore. It was literally just to track how long I had stopped smoking for but didn't really help with anything else. I can't work out how to stop giving them money.

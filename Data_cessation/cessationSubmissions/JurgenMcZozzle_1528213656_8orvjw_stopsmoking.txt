questions about vaping

hey, I thought about getting a vape just to ensure that I wont come back to cigarettes.

now my plan was to basically get a vape with one small bottle of juice without nicotine just to make sure I wont get drunk and buy cigarettes or something \(yes I know its dumb to buy a vape only to throw it off like a week later but if it will help its worth it\) and I got a couple of questions just to make sure the plans fine.  
1\) does the nicotine free juice satisfies the cravings? or do you just feel like you took a breath through a straw?

2\) can you get addicted to vaping nicotine free juice?

3\) is vaping really harmful? i've been looking online and couldnt find any harmful effect of it, not that I think its any good to go from one addiction to another, but quitting cigs for me seems like a lost fantasy, if its possible to smoke without the bad effects of cigarettes then its fine by me.

4\) more specifically, does it effect my cardio performance? because its kinda been the main reason i've quit ciggies.

5\) if so, which vape should I get? \(if you could link a site that you could order online from that would be cool\)

thanks

I took the leap and just did it!

I took the leap today and just quit. So far it’s been 12 hours (Australia Timezone haha). I’ve already had a coworker try and offer me a cigarette, my husband also as soon as I got home. 

I have to say, I never thought I could just take the leap and do it. I’ve been smoking 30+ cigarettes a day for the last 8 years.

I had 3 packets left from a carton later last week and a promised that once I got to the last one there was no turning back. 

I reminded myself often that the last packet will be the last packet.

So far so good, I just reached the 12 hr Mark. I have this empty feeling in the pit of my stomach and it feels like I’m hungry but I can eat with no satisfaction. What is this and will it make me gain weight?

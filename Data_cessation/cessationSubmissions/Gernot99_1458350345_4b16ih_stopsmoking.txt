22 days done and just wanted to share that I feel GREAT today - let's do this guys, it's SOO worth it!

Just want to give you guys who are currently struggling with cravings a heads up that it does get better!!!! 
I am on my 23rd day right now and it's the first time that I really enjoy not smoking. No big cravings, not missing to smoke even whilst doing my habits (coffee break etc). Feels actually really good!
Let's not give in, let us not have the nicotine monster winning over our will power, let's continue to be non-smokers. It's AWESOME! 
Spring is kicking in here in Europe on top of it, pure sunshine, nice temperature - off to a trail ride on my MTB tomorrow morning, can't wait to experience my increased stamina thanks to not smoking. 
We can do it guys! ✊🏼✊🏼

Desperately want to give up smoking, but nothing seems to work, help!

I've been smoking for about a year now, and started as I started dating a girl who smoked so I just gradually fell into it, and we've been together since. 

I enjoy smoking, I'm not going to say that I don't, however I do have a very heavy conscience about it. I recently watched a video which gave me a palpitation at the end, [Very interesting!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRL7o2kPqw0&t=192) , but I also have a heart condition, and my father did die of cancer of an unknown primary (riddled so much as an autopsy would yield little results) when I was young and the multitude of other reasons to give up smoking. 

I can't seem to stick to stopping though. with my girlfriend smoking it makes it difficult even to cut back, e-cigarettes didn't agree with me, they just didn't.. work or hit the same spot a cigarette would, patches just made my arm itchy as all hell. I've tried with raw willpower, however I quickly fall back into a routine of smoking whenever I get the opportunity.

And so I decided to make this post, totally bottom of the barrel just wanting a bit of guidance or something, I don't really know, I just don't want smoking plaguing my body / mind any more.

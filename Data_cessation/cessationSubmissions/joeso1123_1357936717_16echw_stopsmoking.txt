Wisdom teeth helping me quit

I'm 24, been smoking for 5 years. Eight days ago I had my wisdom teeth out. I haven't had a cigarette since the night before that. I hadn't really planned on quitting, it just sort of happened because you aren't supposed to smoke during the healing process. Now that I've come this far I'm thinking I might as well quit. Tonight will be the real test. I haven't been around anyone smoking, haven't drank alcohol, haven't smoked weed since the surgery. Those are the only things that might cause me to light one up.

After 28 Years, I have officially QUIT!!!

I started smoking at 15 and I've been a faithful "employee" of cigarettes ever since... I've smoked everyday, all day, rain or shine, happy or sad and never took a sick day from cigarettes- not even the two times I had severe bronchitis... I never got a vacation from them, not once, in 28 years... there was one time I tried to resign and within 36 hours, they were calling me back in to work! And like the dutiful and dedicated employee I am, I went right back to smoking...

It is 7 degrees outside right now, with a windchill factor of -15... the zipper just broke on my coat and I went out to smoke an hour ago and nearly froze my lungs shut! I've smoked outside in blizzards and in heatwaves and in much colder weather, but for some reason, this morning was the last straw... 

I had 4 cigarettes left in the pack and I destroyed them. 

Time to quit this thankless job... The sad thing is, I don't get any retirement benefits or a farewell party from RJ Reynolds.

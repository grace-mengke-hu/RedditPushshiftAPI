YOU GUYS are the reason for my success

Okay. So, I'm at 11 days now. Tonight was mighty difficult; reasoned w myself many times to have a smoke. But I didn't. Why? Cause yall hold me accountable as I do to you. I don't know any of you, but I will judge your mettle, as I expect you to do for me. ONE SMOKE. ONE DRAG. Don't ever forget this. ONE DRAG IS ALL IT WILL TAKE. Best of wishes to all of yall.

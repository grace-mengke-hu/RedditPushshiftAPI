I accidentally started my quit without thinking. After months of trying.

I have been trying to quit for a while now. I haven't been able to push past the first three days of cravings. I gave into the first craving that struck in the morning. It was really getting me down.  The EasyWay didn't work for me. But then today, suddenly, I refused to give in to a craving. It was only one but it showed me the method. Acknowledge and shrug off the craving like thoughts of a bad ex and get on with the day. Since it clicked, I am grabbing the opportunity fully. I got this!

Also someone here posted quitting smoking means not living a lifestyle that tolerates smoking. I have been more disciplined this week, perhaps that has something to do with it.

All set to quit smoking..i hope!!

Woke up today morning and thought to be free of smoke.. i have been smoking for 10 years now and its high time i should stop. Planning to join a gym too which i guess will ease my cravings but am not sure about the stamina part though. You guys got any ideas for not relapsing? I used to smoke just after waking up, after meals and on my "my time" at night..probably 10 cigs a day. Please advice!

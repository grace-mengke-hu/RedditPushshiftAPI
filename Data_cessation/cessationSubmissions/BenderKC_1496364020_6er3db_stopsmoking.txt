8 Days quit. Feels good, but...

...I have been waking up with the most terrible night sweats and anxiety attacks. I have not been able to sleep through the night since I quit, and have been struggling through the days exhausted. When i say night sweats. I am talking, like, sheets completely drenched through with sweat.

I am assuming this is a physical withdrawl symptom, which would not surprise me based on the sheer amount of nicotine I was taking in on a daily basis.

Has anyone else experienced this before? If so, when will it go away?!

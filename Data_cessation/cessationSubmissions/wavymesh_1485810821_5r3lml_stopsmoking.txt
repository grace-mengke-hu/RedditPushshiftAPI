Day Zero

I'm one hour in on day zero.  Being a near-chain smoker for close to 20 years has hurt my wallet and my ability to walking up steep hills without losing my breath.  I'm broke now and can't even afford a pack with the insane taxes where I live.  When I started it was 1.99 per pack back in '98.  I tried quitting about 10 years ago and made it 30 days or so.  This time, I will do it!  I will stop poisoning my lungs!  

What do you all think about e-cigs?  The way I see it, it's still nicotine and addictive/poisonous, but "not as bad" as cigs.  When I tried to shift to those before, they just made me want to smoke more.  Also, they dry out my mouth so I won't partake those anymore.  Congrats to you all who have made it already.

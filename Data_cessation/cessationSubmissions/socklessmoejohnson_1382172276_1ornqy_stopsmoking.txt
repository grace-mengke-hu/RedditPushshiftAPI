A little bit late but it's been two years on October 10th!

Thank you /r/stopsmoking. It doesn't really seem like a big deal anymore but I like to celebrate my quit date to remind me that it actually totally fucking is a big deal.

Anyways this sub is a great resource for inspiration and quitting tips.

I'd also like to make the obligatory hat-tip to Allen Carr's Easyway, without which I imagine this would have been far more difficult.

Kind of feel like I'm losing my mind, but not giving up.

Seeing that I'm at 125 days already is ASTONISHING, but I never want to go through this again. Ever. 

The level of depression I keep cycling through is morbid. It feels like I'm in a state of grief and am suffering emotionally. 

So I need some encouragement, folks. 

Also, I quit a day after I started seeing someone and I just realized what an awful mistake that was. I like the guy, but I feel so bad for him, as I'm either snapping at something, crying, or just generally miserable. I have some good moments, but physically, emotionally, and mentally I feel drained. 

I'm also rapid cycling a lot. I told him I needed three days to myself, three days I requested off from work as well, to just stay in my apt and retreat from society. I'm not even craving cigarettes at this point, because the shittiness I feel outweighs my desire to smoke. And I've never gone this long without one. Again, I never want to go through this literal anguish ever again, so I'd be massively disappointed if I caved in at this point. No looking back now. 

Sorry for the vent, and possibly over-the-top level of melodrama in this post, but there has to be several of you out there who know what I'm referring to. Tell me what week do I start feeling myself again. Ugh.

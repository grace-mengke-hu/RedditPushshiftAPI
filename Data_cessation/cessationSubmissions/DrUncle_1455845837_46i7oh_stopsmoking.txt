Finding quitting caffeine more difficult that tobacco ...

I prepared myself to quit smoking and when I did I was pleasantly surprised that it seems relatively easy.  Four months later I decide to quit drinking pop and man it's way more difficult.  I think about it all the time and feel deprived.  The difference is - if they told me the world was ending tomorrow I'm pretty sure I still wouldn't smoke, just don't want to, but I'd crack a pop in a heartbeat.  I wish they had an Alan Carr-like book for food.

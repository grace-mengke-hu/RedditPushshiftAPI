12 days smoke free and wondering why this is so easy?

i've tried to quit several times before with various methods (ecig, patches, cold turkey, lollies) but i've always failed before i've hit the two week mark. i've been smoking for just about ten years now, so i figured that's why, but this time around i just haven't wanted any, even after meals (big trigger for me). i know i haven't hit the two week mark yet, but this time into previous attempts i've been clawing my eyes out with the cravings. 

did any of you have a moment of 'nope' or is this just a weird response that will eventually turn into 'haha fooled you!'

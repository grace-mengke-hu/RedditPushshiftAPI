2 years clean, then relapse

Pack a day for 7 years, then my SO and I decided to stop together and I've been clean for a little more than 2 years. 

I was recently accepted to a competitive law school to get my JD, and I guess I never really figured out a way to deal with my stress and anxiety. After having a panic attack while doing assignments, I relapsed, bought a pack and for the last 3 days I've been smoking. 

I know the stress is only going to get worse and I've been hiding it from my SO. I'm scared because I know that this is going to evolve from 2-3 cigs a day to a pack a day when I actually start attending classes next week. I really have no idea what to do, I'm more afraid of my crippling anxiety then quitting smoking and I know to quit I need to prioritize quitting above all else. 

Also, to make things worse, I know this school has a very heavy smoking culture, almost all the students smoke, and I just know I'm going to get sucked in. 

I keep telling myself that this is only for 1L, and that when things relax and I'm on track that I can quit again, but what if I can't?

It sucks because part of me doesn't want this, but the other part knows that continuing to smoke will make things easier for me. 

Tl;dr Clean for 2 years. Recently relapsed to deal with my crippling anxiety. Attending law school. Don't want to jeopardize my grades but at the same time don't want to fall back into the cycle.

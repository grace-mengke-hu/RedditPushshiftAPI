I got a cold and decided to quit smoking

I get a couple colds a year and the older I get, the harder they are to bounce back from. I hate being down any length of time, it feels like such a waste. Smoking isn't helping. Plus, I'm tired of all the extra coughing, especially at night; not being able to breath and just enjoy a nice walk like a non smoker; I'd like my hair and my clothes to smell nice again; and I really don't want to die of lung cancer.

So, I got the worst of the withdrawal over while I was my sickest and I don't feel too bad today. I've enjoyed reading materials about what happens to my body as I start to mend. I feel pretty happy and lighthearted.

I haven't told anyone yet - Reddit! You're the first to know! And I don't know that I want to outright announce it to just anyone in my world. I work in a bar and people just assume that if you've quit, you'll give in. I don't need that. I'll just stay quiet for now and take it as it comes, see how it goes. If I need a hand, I'll reach out here.

Thanks for listening, folks. Have a nice day :)

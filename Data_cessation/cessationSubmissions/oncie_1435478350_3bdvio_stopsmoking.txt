I want to stop, but I'm worried...

[context] I have been smoking about a half a pack a day for 2-3 years now...and it's getting to me. I want to quit but between my job in a factory where if I'm not fully aware i could get fired(working nights at that) and my kids (1,3,5) getting the raw end of my frustration, and the fatigue idk who else to turn to.

so smokers/ ex-smokers of reddit. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE tell me what you did to replace, avoid , and to stop smoking once and for all

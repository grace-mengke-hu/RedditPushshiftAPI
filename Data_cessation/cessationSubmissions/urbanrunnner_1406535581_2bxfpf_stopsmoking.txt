This time it feels different

I've quit dozens of times. A few months here and few weeks there. Patches, ecigs, Carr, lozenges, hypnosis and many more. Some of these methods worked for a bit, some didn't. 

This time I just really wanted it. It's weird ... I honestly never thought I'd be that guy you hear about who smokes for twenty years and then just stops. But that's what appears to be happening. No cravings, no irritability. A few times I've though "I'll just do this thing after I've had a smoke" ... and then realised I don't smoke now ...

I guess the nicotine is out my system now. Is this really it? Am I free?

my 4th day, so close

Good day to you all

i smoked heavily for 7 years, almost 30 cigs a day, in 2 hours it will be my 4th day.

yesterday was hell to me, i really mean it, i stayed up from 2 to 4 am convincing myself not to give up.

today, i can't describe how painful it was, these past 4-5 hours i was really close to smoking one, i'm super mad, weak and lonely.

speaking of being lonesome, i'm not used to that, it's just that all my friends are heavy smokers (both cigs and weed) and i'm afraid me getting around them would make quitting harder for me.

do you think i'm doing the wrong thing? by isoliting myself not telling anyone about my pain?

by the way i'm trying to keep myself busy, i'm not completly dying, i went for a 30 minutes run yesterday and i'm willing to do that again tomorrow, i play league of legends (video games) and i eat alot, i really enjoy eating and what???? suddenly i feel better writing this out.. this is weird

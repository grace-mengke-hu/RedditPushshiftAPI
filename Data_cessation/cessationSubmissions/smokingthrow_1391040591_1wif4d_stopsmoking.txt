Had a (mildly) humiliating experience; dangerously close to falling off the wagon

(Vent ahead) Smoker for a little over a year. Four days ago I decided I was tired of wheezing and smelling awful and generally being out of shape, so I decided to quit smoking and replace the habit with exercising. It was going really well; I was surprised by how motivated I was and I genuinely felt a bit better. I even went to the gym and briskly walked for an hour yesterday! But today, in my high school (I know) gym class, we unexpectedly had to run a mile. About a third of the way through, I had the worst burning pain in my chest, and I couldn't breathe/ felt like I needed to spit up and ended up walking and finishing nearly last. My face was blotchy and beat red and people started to notice. My gym teacher even pity-sat with me afterward and I just wanted to cry/ throw up. I used to be pretty good at running.  
  
I know this should really motivate me to get my shit together and be a turning point but I just feel really small and sad and not nearly as happy and driven; I'm worried I gave myself asthma and I'm dreading going back to class and I have the situational craving for a cigarette. I'm not sure if this belongs here but I just needed to get this off of my chest because I'm really too embarrassed to say something about it to anyone I know.

And on the seventh day, she needed help.

Hey Reddit,
It's day seven. I've waited to post until I was serious. This time, I know I need a support system. I've quit drinking as well (I work in a bar), so it's been a weird week to say the least. Today was particularly aggressive and stressful and I found myself to be snappier than my usual naturally sarcastic self. I don't want to be *that* broad who quit smoking and is now terrible to be around. Any words of encouragement or advice?

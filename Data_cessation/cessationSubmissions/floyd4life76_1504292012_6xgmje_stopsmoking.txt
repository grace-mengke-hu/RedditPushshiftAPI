Need help to stop smoking in my car

Hey everyone! So I made the decision to quit starting September, and now we're here. I just need help to know what to do when the craving hits me. 
I have a job as a drug rep and I'm in my car all the time, and I always used to smoke in there. 

What are some suggestions to do instead of smoking in the car? Thanks so much!

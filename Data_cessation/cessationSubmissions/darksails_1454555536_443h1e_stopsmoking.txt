Had to reset my badge :(

Hey all, 

I had to reset my badge. I quit for about 50 days back in May.  After a night of drinking I fell into the "just one" trap, convincing myself I could control my addiction.  It didn't help that my drinking buddy brother loved smoking along with my husband. 

In a strange turn of events my brother quit over 40 days ago. So having him as a supporter is helpful. But in the end I realize this is my choice, my body, and my life. 

Top three reasons I want to quit:

-I hate supporting the greed behind the corporation leadership and shareholders. Tobacco and big food... Serious disdain. 

-I want to stop allowing a chemical to have so much control over my life.  I often chose not go out with work people because I need to get home to smoke. 

-I want to die from natural causes!! 

So there it is, badge all reset, on day three... Sipping juice once in a while and mindfully progressing.  Thank you guys in this sub!

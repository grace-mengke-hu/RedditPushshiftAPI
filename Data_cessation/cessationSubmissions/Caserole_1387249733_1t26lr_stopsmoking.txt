Thoughts while I approach Day 2. A lot of firsts happened today!

I get these waves where all I can do is punch my hand and wish I could actually enjoy my last cigarette.

I quit randomly, so the last cigarette I smoked was just a regular old cigarette. Day 1 went O.K. I am 4 hours away from 2 days smoke-free and I notice some weird withdrawal symptoms:

1. Mouth is very watery. 
2. I feel like I didn't have any coffee today but I did. Very spacey, unfocused.
3. I can't keep track of time. Right now it is 10pm but I feel like it's 6pm. Today went by slow.
4. Small fits of rage and annoyance. I punch my open palms when I get pissed about never having a cigarette and all the nice times I have had with them.


I am a beer and cig person. I had a beer with my boyfriend last night without smoking, which is an accomplishment for me. But, I feel terribly paranoid about drinking in the future. I camp a lot, too, and the best feeling in the world is a cigarette and beer by the campfire. Just typing this is making me angry. I need some support. My mouth is craving it again.


Here were my firsts:

1. Driving to work with smoking
2. Going on my meal break without smoking
3. Did not go on a ten-minute break at all
4. Went shopping a bit after getting off from work and didn't buy a pack at the newsstand.

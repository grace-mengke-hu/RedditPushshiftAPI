1 week barrier, u mad?

7 days in, thankyou /r/stopsmoking, first quit ive ever done cold turkey, usually ill be feigning over mints and patches, cold turkey is far more enjoyable, thanks for getting me onto easyway as well!
book made me stop halfway through reading, the same night i got drunk with uni mates...didnt smoke, next night drank with uni mates...didnt smoke, noticing more stamina in the bedroom - chyeah, like my erections are more solid! my gums are bleeding less so hopefully that problem will go away, eating like a pig, hitting gym, less lethargic in the mornings, early starts are a joy rather than a strenuous task...my heart doesnt feel like its about to explode when i blow, benefits just from 7 days, cant wait to see whats to come
-withdrawals are pretty consistent yet mild
-ill have alot of intervals in my night sleeps (every 2 hours) ill just wake up, but dose back asleep again, so big fucking deal
smoke my dick ciggs

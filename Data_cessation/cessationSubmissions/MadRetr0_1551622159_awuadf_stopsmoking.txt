Well, I fell off the wagon

I fell off the wagon yesterday. I managed to be smoke-free for over a week! I went to a bar for the first time since I quit, and smoking has always been part of being in a bar. I was pretty drunk and I smoked 3. The utter DEFEAT when I checked the smoke-free app after I smoked and It said "smoke free 8 days". I felt terrible.

The good thing is, I have absolutely no desire to go and buy a pack. I thought that even if I smoked one, I'd fall back to the habit again. But that didn't happen. I won't give up, I'll still try to stay quit. Atleast I now know that I have to be more careful next time I go drinking. The reason why I shared this here is because this subreddit has seriously helped me quit, and you guys are awesome!

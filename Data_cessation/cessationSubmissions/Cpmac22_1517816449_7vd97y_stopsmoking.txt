Day 1

26 y.os and have been On and off smoker since early college. I managed to quit for a year and a half but lately the life stressors are overwhelming me. I cant shake this monkey clawing into my back. Im starting to show symptoms of chronic cough, irritated throat, sensitive gums/teeth... I have FUCKING had it. I am not going to be a slave to a chemical binding itself to receptor in my brain telling me I need this. Last time i quit, i just got so pissed off at cigarettes it wasnt a problem then. Yet it didnt provide a lasting solution. 

I talk a big.game now buy by tomorrow my resolve may be weaker... I pray not. But this relationship/battle with cigarettes will last the rest or a good portion of my life. I am sure of it. I am asking the community for support and I will support those needing me the best I can. Feel free to DM me. Social support will be our greatest weapon to overcoming this addiction and those top 1% greedy individuals profiting off our cigarette purchases. Lets stick it to them! LETS GO. Day 1. 

Thank you for providing me a place to vent all. Sorry for the word vomit.

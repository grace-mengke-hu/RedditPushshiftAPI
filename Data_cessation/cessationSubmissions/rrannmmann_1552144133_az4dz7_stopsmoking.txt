Starting to Quit using Chantix

So I started taking Chantix to quit smoking last Monday.    I have not had any side effects from the meds but cigs taste horrible now.  I am trying to set a quit date.  The instructions say to pick a day from 8 to 35 days from when you start taking the meds.  Anyone have experience with this?

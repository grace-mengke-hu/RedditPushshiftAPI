Triggers and how I deal...

I just breathe or walk quickly through trigger locations or just dont pay attention. I also keep myself distracted if we are in a shopping location or restaurant. I tell myself that it is a trigger as I am currently NOT craving it, rather it is just a trigger. Also I NEVER keep ANY cigarette near me, ever. Never have and never will. Those fuckers are just too tempting if I kept ANY near me, which I don't.

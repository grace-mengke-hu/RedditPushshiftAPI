Day One

Hi everyone!
I'm hoping that today is the day that I'll finally kick the habit. Maybe talking about it with other people who are going/went through the same thing will help.

I'm sick of the smell, the cost, the coughing and most of all: being out of breath after a small effort.

I've tried to quit before: only smoking in the weekends. But this doesn't work. I'll smoke on Monday, and sometimes Tuesday, as well because I've got some left. It doesn't take long to evolve into smoking everyday again..

Any tips or tricks to improve my chances?

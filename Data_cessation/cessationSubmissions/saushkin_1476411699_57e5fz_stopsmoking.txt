70 days

If someone wants to follow my doings, i decided and quit cold turkey on holiday and got drunk that very night and did not smoke :).(so for me the hardest road).  i was focused on having a good time just living the moment while i was this man on an important mission. I did do it while my best friend was around since he is a non smoker and that helped. First i felt like i was free falling and afterwards as if someone took great burden of me. Bottom line in my opinion if you really want it deep within and think its beyond important to do so you will quit . How i feel now? Much calmer, more energy, happier, better sleep, stronger,  and the most importantly- free. So my advice is let go and go on a smoke free life adventure and once you are back you will decide whether you want to smoke again or not.



i hope that will help someone  im not much of a story teller and engl. not my native lang. And ive been here reading for months big hug to all.

I dont like being an addict.

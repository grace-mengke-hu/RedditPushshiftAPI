Made it all the way through Feb!

The star with a one in it! My decision to quit was pretty spur of the moment and I've felt this whole time that I was in a very tenuous position, that it would be too easy to just give up on giving up, that I couldn't really trust myself to succeed at this.

Reaching a milestone like this is an insanely good feeling and has made me reassess my potential for success. Ich bin ein non smoker!

Soooo Tired --- is this normal?

So far,  I have not found quitting to be overly difficult, but yesterday I was really spacy and tired, and today I am just flat out tired.  I am battling a cold, which was my 'springboard' to quitting, so I guess it could be that?  

Also,  I can't sleep at night -- what's up with that?  

I used to go home and enjoy my glass of wine and smoke, not smoking has made me not want the glass of wine -- I am not even a little interested --  

when will life be more 'normal' ?

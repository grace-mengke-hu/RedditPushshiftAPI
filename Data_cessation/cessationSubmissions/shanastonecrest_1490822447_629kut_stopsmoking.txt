Day 10

So I've been a smoker for 12 years and have said to myself it was the last pack for about 10 years.  I've quit for a few days at a time but always came back.  It won't happen this time. The real difference between then and now is working out.  Over the past few months I have been pushing my workout routine and have gone to places I didn't think I could reach.  The more I reached those impossible points the more I saw them as possible. Now when I get the cravings I tell myself well anything is possible and I can get thru them

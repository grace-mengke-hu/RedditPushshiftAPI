Beware using E-cigs to quit

I used to smoke maybe half a pack of cigarettes a day, usually less - I always needed at least *one* cigarette a day to kill my cravings. I switched to an e-cig 2 years ago, and never smoked cigarettes since. Don't get me wrong, e-cigs are absolutely better for you, they feel better, they don't make you smell terrible and have bad breath, and I could even use them while getting myself back into shape (including building myself up to being able to run outdoors for almost an hour and a half straight). 

But that's almost the problem. It was so enjoyable, with so few ill effects (if any), that I began using it at every opportunity, all day. Just constantly vaping away, whether it be for an hour straight with coffee in the morning, my entire drive to and from work, every break and lunch, hours on the weekends, I could go on an on.

Now I'm quitting nicotine altogether, and it is much worse than when I had been trying to quit cigarettes before the e-cig. So don't get me wrong, if you're already smoking 2 packs a day, or have no problem with nicotine itself - by all means, get an e-cig. They are fantastic. But just keep in mind, that if independence from nicotine is your ultimate goal, e-cigs may not be the way to go.

Any advice for someone trying to quit when their spouse is still a smoker?

I’ve tried to quit dozens of times but my husband is a smoker and isn’t ready to quit. This means I have to say no to smoking constantly and constantly reminded of how easy it is for me to do. I feel bad because sometimes I resent him a little for being a smoker since I know I would have quit for good by now if it weren’t for him wanting to continue the habit. Any tips?

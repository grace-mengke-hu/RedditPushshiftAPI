I guess I'm being more irritable than i realize, and it's making it hard not to smoke

I'm on day 4 of not smoking. I'm not being actively mean, but I guess I was being irritable and really upset my girlfriend. I picked her up and she immediately started smoking. I didn't say anything about it, but it did make me angry and have a real bad craving being around cigarette smoke for 10 minutes.


I also have misophonia, an intolerance to certain sounds, and I'd always used smoking to deal with it better, but she spoke with her mouth full og food and was eating a crispy snack. 


I didn't even notice doing anything to show i was upset. Ive been actively avoiding showing my irritability because I know if i start fights I'll just end up smoking again. 


But she said i made her feel like shit and she's not okay. She's questioning whether I actually care and saying that I'm acting like im not interested. 


It's just hard and makes me want to smoke just so I'm not grumpy without even realizing it.

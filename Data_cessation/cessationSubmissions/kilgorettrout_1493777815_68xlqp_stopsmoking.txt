Today makes 3 months for me

I want to share with my friends and family, but they are either smokers who don't care, or non smokers who don't understand. I smoked a pack a day for 10 years. I quit with the help of the patch, which I've been off of just over a month now. Something that has helped me quit, chewing gum. I chew a piece of gum when I get a craving, usually only a few times a day now. 

Treating myself to a nice glass of wine tonight(or two) :-)

IRRITABILITY!!!! arahhh

I am furious at an uninformed idiot and a troll. (not reddit. shocker I know lol) Wow am I angry at nothing. I gotta lose this ecig too. I've used it more in the past hour then I ever would of smoked. I am going to become dependent on that even though there is no nicotine. The inhaling sensation was part of the satisfaction of smoking. 

Shitpost I know, sorry. I had to vent somewhere.

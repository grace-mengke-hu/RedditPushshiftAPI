I made it to one month!

There have been days where I don't think of smoking, days where I walk past a smoker and half-laugh to myself anout how happy I am that I stopped, and days where I kinda miss it. When the third happens I just remind myself that all I miss is nicotine and an excuse to leave the room or take a momemt to myself, nothing else, and I can leave the room without having nicotine because it is not worth it. There are days where I feel like shit for one reason or another, and I have a thought for a half a second that a cigarette is what I would have normally had at this time, then I have ro remind myself that it's not what I do anymore.
I haven't been smoke free for this long since I started, which was about 4 years ago. I forgot how much better my singing voice is without smoking, and as someone who loves to sing as a hobby, I can't believe it took me this long to quit and hit those high notes again! 
Sorry for the long post I just wanted to share, and thank the people posting on here for all of their encouragement and stories. When I can't stop thinking about smoking, I read this subreddit for reminders of why I quit. 

Tl,dr: I'm at a month as a non-smoker , still have slight cravings but I can manage them, and y'all are amazing

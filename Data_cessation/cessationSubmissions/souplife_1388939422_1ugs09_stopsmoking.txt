2 weeks!

I've made it through the first two weeks! According to the kickit app on my phone I have saved over $100 in that time, which is amazing. Knowing that myself and my apartment smell much better is a pretty good bonus as well.

The first three or four days were hell (sound familiar?), but the past week or so has been fine. I quit drinking a month before giving up smoking (wanted to tackle one thing at a time), so my biggest trigger is no longer an issue, which is probably helping a lot. Feels good!

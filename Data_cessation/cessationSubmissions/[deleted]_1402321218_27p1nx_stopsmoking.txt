4 Days and some thoughts

Well I made it to four days. Challenging myself the way I did actually worked, but I would not recommend it unless you for sure feel the same about your situation:

Basically what I did was start my quit before having to do back to back twelve hour shifts at my job which can be stressful and create an intense environment. Immediately following that I went out drinking with my friends, some of whom smoke. I have been using the e-cig (more on that in a bit), but it just isn't the same. The temptations were fierce. I really started to wonder if I was even going to last... I did. I am not trying to brag, nor am I in any way suggesting that my version of quitting by throwing myself into the fire was smart. It was, however, effective and it worked for me and if it works for someone else, then awesome.

I would like to say a couple things about the e-cig. First off, if you're one of those people who was able to make the switch and not feel any differences, I'm happy for you. I really am. If all you had to do was switch to the preferred alternative and slowly wind down your nicotine use and NOT go through a tough struggle I won't lie, I envy you. I was not so fortunate. Most of my friends and some people here have assumed that the e-cig is no different than regular cigarettes cause of the nicotine. I can tell you firsthand that is not true. The e-cig just isn't the same. It doesn't have the same feel, the same anything except a little nicotine. I also only hit it when I feel I truly need it and I'm not getting nearly the amount of nicotine I was with cigarettes. I know that doesn't end the nicotine addiction altogether, but it is a step in the right direction.

Tough days, but will not break

Just to stay on track I need to speak my mind. The past two days have been a bit more difficult. I am currently on a business trip and before quitting smoking, business trips were like a smoking bonanza to me - wife is in a different time zone and I could book a smokers room in the hotel. 

So basically in the morning I lit up as soon as I opened my eyes. And fell asleep right after my last cigarette of the day. 

Also on my business trips there is usually a lot of alcohol consumption with clients. So this has been trigger after trigger with upcoming waves of cravings. 

But I have decided not to break. I told all my customers right away that I've quit smoking. My professional appearance is worth more to me than the cigarette I will regret. Sticking to your decisions is actually considered very professional :)
And for the time away from my customers I am lucky to have you guys - after writing these words I already feel the cravings going away. 

Putting emotions in to words helps.

And thanks for being here.

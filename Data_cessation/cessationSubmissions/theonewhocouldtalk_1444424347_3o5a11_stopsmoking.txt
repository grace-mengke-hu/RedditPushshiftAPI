What can I do to support my sister as she quits smoking?

My sister has decided to quit smoking. This makes me extremely happy, even though it's for financial reasons vice health concerns. We live on opposite sides of the world (14 hour time difference). What can I do to help her from afar? I know I can send care packages and affirming texts messages and emails. Are there any general or specific things that I can send? She asked me directly to help keep her motivated and I don't want to let her down. I have in the past offered her $1000 if she went smoke-free for a full year as added motivation. She didn't to make it last time. I want to present her with the reward this time around.

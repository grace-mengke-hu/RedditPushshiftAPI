Considering giving up

I havn't smoked since St. Patricks day due to the hangover, not having any cigarettes, no money and being too lazy to go to the shops. I'm 20 and I've smoked since I was 17. I wholeheartedly enjoy smoking and consider the time I take out of my day to go outside and have a cigarette some of the most relaxing time there is. I get fresh air, a new bit of scenery, and a nice rollie to boot. Smoking is also such a social thing... meeting new friends through smoke breaks and most of my friends are already smokers. Smoking is cheap where I am at only 5 euro's for a pack of tobacco. I'm only 20 so I'm really not concerned with long-term health effects, my bodies young and should be able to handle it. I'm not interested in the negative impacts smoking have on fitness as I'm not into exercise. But, I do know smoking is bad for you, and quitting will only get harder over time... But I love smoking. I have the dilemma now, should I try to quit... or should I run down to the shops and buy a pack? Any discussion would really help, cheers!

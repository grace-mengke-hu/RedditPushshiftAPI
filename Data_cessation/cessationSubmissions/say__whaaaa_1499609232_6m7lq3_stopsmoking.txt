I fucked up, but I'm moving past it.

I fucked up and had a few puffs of my friends spliff the other night, and now I am fighting cravings so much worse than it was the first time I quit.
Hardest days are day 1 and 4-7 for me. Around day 6-I always start to feel better and it's crazy how much your mind says, "well you made it 6 days so you can do it again." Which gives you the excuse to smoke. But honestly - not another puff is the only way. No matter what because this is honestly hell to be doing this over again. 
But I am re-reading Allens book and I'm going to use this community more when I feel the urge to backslide. 
Re-setting my quitting timer was the worse feeling in the world. And knowing I have to relive day 1-5 cravings again makes me want to scream, but it should just give me more motivation to get off the never-ending fucked up hamster wheel.
Thank you all for being a part of this with me. It's a step I'm taking alone in my life and it's easier knowing you are all here.
NOT ANOTHER PUFF!!!

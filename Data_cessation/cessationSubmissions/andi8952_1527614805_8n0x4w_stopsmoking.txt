Water your friend

Dudes,

My mom just brought me a flask for water where you can add fresh fruits. Now as tea season is over perhaps some of you might prefer water with fruit-taste. 

Although my taste buds are still messed up, I think it’s damn cool and it adds perfectly to my meditation practice. :-) 

Still haven’t lost hope that one day I ditch that stupid addiction. :-)

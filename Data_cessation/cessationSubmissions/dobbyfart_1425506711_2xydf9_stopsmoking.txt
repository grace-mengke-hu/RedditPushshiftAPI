One month!!

One month ago, I relapsed. There's a lot going on in my life right now, including a custody battle. After almost every court date, I would relapse. But I didn't yesterday! I thought about it for about five seconds, but found some more constructive ways to blow off steam.  Mostly, eating. Seriously. I think I ate a week's worth of calories yesterday. But I did not smoke, and I do not regret eating to keep myself from buying a pack of cigarettes. 

Yay!!

How do i stop smoking while drinking ?

I'm "smokefree" for a little bit over a month now. In my day to day life it's really easy and i can ignore the little craving I have easily. The only problem is when I'm out drinking. After a few beers my mind just needs a cigarette, I can't really enjoy anything as long as I don't  smoke. I don't smoke as much as I did while I was smoking everyday and when I'm sober again I also don't need to smoke but I'm quiet sure that I can't really stop smoking if I continue this "partysmoking". So my question is, does anyone have an idea how I can stop this ?

Eleven Days: Longest Yet!

Yeah this is the longest I have gone without a cigarette of my own free will in my whole life! 

I smoked for 23 years.

The hypnotism really helped me through the first week, and today is actually the first really hard day! 

Not sure what all brought it on but just been feeling miserable and fixating on the idea of smoking a cigarette. It's crazy and I'm not going to: but I thought I'd post on here and just check in. 

23 years and eleven days has got me stressed! 

It's nice though that I can at least wake up tomorrow knowing that I got through today. Hopefully will be a benchmark day for me.

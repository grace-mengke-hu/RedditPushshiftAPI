Putting our money where our mouths are.

Me and a group of friends have decided that its time to quit and money is a hell of a motivator.  We have decided that we're going to get together Wednesday evening for sort of a last cigarette (reading Allen Carr's book in the meantime) and after that point if one of us breaks that person will be donating a rather large (for our income) sum of money to the American Heart Association.  The idea is that a cigarette could not possibly be worth that much money to us and hopefully will serve as a good deterrent to breaking and smoking again.  Has anyone else tried something like this before?  If so what were the results?

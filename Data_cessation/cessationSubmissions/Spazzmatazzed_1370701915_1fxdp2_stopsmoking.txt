6 Weeks!

Just wanted to say that this is by far the longest I've gone without smoking since I started! I feel great and don't even remember the last time I had a really bad craving. Smoking feels so distant now, it's like an old relationship. Every now and then, I look back on it with fond memories, but I know now that I'm much happier and better off now.  

The biggest challenge was about a week in, while drinking at a very smokey bar, my friend asked me to hold his cigarette for him while he went to use the restroom, and I didn't take a single drag. I just awkwardly held it out away from me until he got back. After that, I knew that this quit would be different.  Last weekend, I hung out with a lot of my smoker friends at a party for the first time since then. I went outside with them while they smoked, and didn't even feel the least bit inclined to ask for a drag

If I have any advice to give people just starting out, it would be to start exercising. I started doing P90X about a week before I quit, and every time I got a really bad craving, I would think back to how much it sucked wheezing through the warmups and how I'd skip or half ass most all of the cardio workouts. That was motivation enough not to give in and smoke.  This was the only thing I did different than any other time that I've tried to quit, and it has helped tremendously. 

The funny thing is that I didn't even consciously decide to quit for good, I went to out of town to my parent's house one weekend and just didn't want to worry about hiding it or smell like smoke, so I didn't smoke that weekend. After I got back home, I just kept going to see how long I could last. Again, the exercise was a huge motivator, and after a few weeks I barely even missed smoking. 

Well, there's my rant. If you're doubting your quit, and are about to cave, don't do it! It gets easier every day, and life on the other side really is so much better!

Day 13 no nicotine but man is my stomach messed up. Normal?

The urge to smoke is almost completely gone. I feel great! Besides the bloating and constant diarrhea. I eat healthy, haven't changed my diet since I quit. I'm not stressing about much. So the only thing I can think is my body is adjusting? Anyone else able to confirm this? Thanks and keep up the great work guys :) you're all awesome

No longer a fool this April 1st

For 15 years I've played a constant joke on myself. No more. Today, I am a non-smoker. 

I just smoked my last cigarette ever.  I didn't enjoy it and frankly I'm excited about never smoking another one.

Badge reset to zero. Pack is crushed and in the trash. The joke's finally on you, cigarettes, and I will have the last laugh.

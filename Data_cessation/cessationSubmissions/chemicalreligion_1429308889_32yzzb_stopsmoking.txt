Quitting isn't a simple as most make it seem it be.

I'm 20 and have been smoking for 2 years. I've never been a pack-a-day smoker. I smoke on a schedule since my days are all very similar. It takes 40 minutes to get to work and I get bored. Most of my friends smoke as well. I associate smoking with getting off of work, drinking a hot mug of tea, a break when I'm at band practice, etc. I don't actually ENJOY smoking much anymore, it's just a thing I do in-between other things. My girlfriend (whom I live with) also smokes and we're both trying to quit. We just bought a vape and 6mg juice but I don't like how convenient it is compared to actually going outside every time. My idea was to go outside to smoke the vape but I've still smoked 2 cigarettes today.  
Anyway, TL;DR, I associate smoking with actions, I'm mentally aware of that and I want to find away to replace that with something that doesn't involve taking a drag from something.

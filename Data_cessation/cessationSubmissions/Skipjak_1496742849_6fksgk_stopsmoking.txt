One week again!

Just wanted to check in. Today marks a week since quitting again after a relapse, hurray!

I'm feeling great. My chest is still a little sore, but apart from that I am starting to enjoy the benefits of quitting again. I feel great, I smell great, my sports performance is great. 
I feel very much in control of myself and my thoughts and impulses. Now I must make sure not to fall for the trap of having 'just one', and then 'just a couple' again. Good luck to all the rest of you!

Only Cold Turkey is FUN!!!

Hello all....Wish you best for everything you're doing to stay away from this shitty habit. I quit eight days back after 21 years of smoking. In past, I tried zillion methods and failed (whoooohooo). But eight days back, I quit cold turkey and now I'm loving it. Yea, I am loving the process. It's only cold turkey which gives you an amazing experience of highs and lows.....at one moment you are hitting the sky with joy and next you are dying to have one puff like miserable junk....hahaha....and that's why I like this hardcore method....this is not for weak heart (though no one has weak heart unless think so). Only one thing I do when craving hits me is I have a bottle with cap and inside guess what? (yea, few cig butts) and I open the cap, smell the butts and there you go...craving fades away.....and now with every day, I need it less and less....In second week, I'm noticing more anger but I know why so I'm trying to fix it to keep my family not suffer because of that....wish best to all of you good people....let us be the force to eliminate this shit from our and other's (as many as possible) lives.....

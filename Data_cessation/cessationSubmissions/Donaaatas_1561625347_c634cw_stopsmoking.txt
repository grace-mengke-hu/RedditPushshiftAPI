My partner and I quit smoking by joking about quitting

We would always go for a smoke in a balcony and just chat, relax together. Of course, we both knew that the habit is bad for us, and we wanted to quit...

And every time we go near at the end of the pack we would joke "we will not buy the next one", "okay.. last cigarette" just to go to the store and buy a new pack in a few hours or the next day. 

But last week it happened that we said the same thing. We both did not think it was serious. but here we are \~1week+ non-smokers. together. And now it would just feel stupid to throw out the progress.

Just for context: If I think I will try to quit - I set up the app or mark the date.. this time it was just talking, didn't think we meant it. So I don't even really know which day it was... but it's a week or a week and a few days by now.

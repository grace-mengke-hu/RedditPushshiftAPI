3 months in..

Three months in, I'd like to call myself a non-smoker rather than a smoke quitter, been smoking for nine years, it's more and more difficult for me each day to understand why I have been smoking for that long, even my tolerance to cigarettes and smokers is going less everyday, sorry but today I find it EXTREMELY STUPID that people do inject toxins in their bodies and are happy about it, they stink and smell and they actually try to justify why they smoke when you ask them, I've been there, and I'm happy I'm not anymore..
 Until today, not a single cravings, not a single puff, I still rarely get nightmares where I lit a cigarette, and I wake up so mad then get so happy it was just a bad nightmare reminding me that I made a good choice.
Please, don't give up, you can stop smoking, and you should!

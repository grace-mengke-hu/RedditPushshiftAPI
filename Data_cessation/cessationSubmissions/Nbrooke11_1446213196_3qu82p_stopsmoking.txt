13 days no smoking, but voice scratchier?!

I've been smoke free since Oct 18th!  Two weeks on Sunday. 
I feel great, kind of. Mostly just pride I think

Certain physically symptoms are confusing me... My nasty, bubbly, night and morning cough has left me, however, my voice seems to go all deep and raspy and scratchy when I'm having a conversation for more than a minute. Especially on the phone. Now I SOUND like a smoker, one of my quit reasons was so when I 'grew up' (I'm 29). I wouldn't sound like a smoker!  

I really hope this is just -part of the healing process-  can anyone shed some light on this??

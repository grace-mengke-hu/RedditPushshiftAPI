12 days ! Traded cigs for the gym

I have trade cigs for a healthy lifestyle I have been going to the gym everyday eating clean and feeling amazing. I recommend to everyone if you are going to quit then have a plan to eat good and work out it will make quitting that much easier remember it’s only as hard as you make it. I have been a pack a day smoker since 14 I’m now 27 and knew something had to change. So I can say I have honestly never been this entergentic and full of life since I was a little girl ! Everyone do it for you do it for your kids your family your dog it’s the best decision you will ever make. I promise

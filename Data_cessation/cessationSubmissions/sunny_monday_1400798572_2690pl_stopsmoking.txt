exhaust fumes...

Ive tried quitting many times. A couple weeks ago I took the plunge and purchased an ecigarette/vape. Ive smoked waay less since, but havent fully quit cigarettes yet. 

The boyfriend and I smoke out on the porch. These past couple weeks... every time he goes out there and comes back in, all I smell is exhaust fumes. I dont smell cigarette smoke... It seriously smells like tailpipe fumes are being directed into the house from the porch area. Ive asked him and he doesnt notice/smell a thing. It IS me/my sense of smell. (Not some random vehicle.)

Yes, it's bizarre. Having tried quitting many times before, I can say Ive never had cigarettes *smell* different to me while Im going through withdrawal.

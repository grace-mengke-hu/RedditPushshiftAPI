666 days - the devil is in the details

From a pack a day smoker for 23 years or so who quit cold turkey 666 days ago here is the secret:

if you want to quit smoking then you have to stop smoking.  

Sounds stupid - no?  But no matter how much you want one, no matter how shit your day was, no matter how much your job sucks, and how busy you are, and how your girl|boy-friend|wife|husband are assholes, and your car got a flat, and you were in an accident, and you have exams coming up, and you just had a great meal, or great sex, or you are so horny, or you racked up your back, or you are on vacation, or just one in the morning to wake up, or one at night to calm you down or whatever bullshit justifications your troll brain throws at you ...

JUST DON'T FUCKING LIGHT UP!!!!

That is the secret.  All the rest is noise ...

If I could do it so can you.

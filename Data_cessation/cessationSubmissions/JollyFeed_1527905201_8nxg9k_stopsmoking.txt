Completed Day One!

So I made it a day without smoking. I'm quitting using the 4mg lozenges. I decided to them only when I need to take the edge off. I only needed two today and I always made sure I ate first and waited an hour before taking it to make sure I wasn't just confusing nicotine cravings with hunger pangs. I realized most of my past failures was from not understanding the hunger/nicotine craving connection. 

I've tried quitting before in the past but it never stuck. This quit time has been a lot easier because I took the time to mentally prepare for it by thinking it over weeks before I quit. I spent a careful amount of time delaying smoking to see what my triggers were ahead of time. Granted, my mind is still filled with a lot of junkie thinking but I feel slightly more in control than previous attempts. I've also changed my diet weeks ago by cutting out as much coffee and sugar \(carbs\) to handled the blood sugar swings. 

Another thing I've noticed that help me this time quitting is for weeks I've woke up at the same time everyday to make sure to keep the same sleep schedule. In past attempts I didn't have a daily routine to cling to when I was deep in a nicotine craving. Now I get up at the same time and go to bed at the same time. Talking myself down from the ledge is a lot easier when I know exactly what I'll be doing based on a routine.

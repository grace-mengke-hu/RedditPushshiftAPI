For the first time in my life

I'm completely disgusted by cigarettes. 

Second attempt now first time I went two weeks. Slipped up around family while on vacation and had a few.

It's been a week since then. The only time I've missed them now is when I had a couple drinks the next day. Even then the urge then wasn't too terrible. I know that complacency is really dangerous so I'm trying to keep in mind that I will most likely think of smokes even a couple years from now. I'm starting to accept that I cannot have even one, and feeling okay with that even for a bit before the next craving comes on feels great.

The moments when I am sober though and the thought of cigarettes bringing on revulsion is kind of awesome. Really glad to feel this way!

Coming up on 24 hrs

This is probably my 5th or 6th time quitting smoking. Honestly I’ve hated smoking for a few years now and I kept telling myself I would quit soon but I kept pushing it off. So yesterday I saw I only had one cigarette left and decided to make it my last. 
One thing I notice that I haven’t noticed before is I am coughing like CRAZY today. 
It’s also wild to me how fucking sad I feel. That’s an emotion I think that always surprises me is how sad I become during the first few days of quitting. 
Downloaded the app and upgraded and trying the paid version. So far it’s been helpful.

Haven't smoked for a week - no idea how I did it

I've made several failed attempts to quit, usually failing after a day or two when the craving became unbearable. A week ago I just woke up with absolutely no desire to smoke, and haven't lit a cigarette since. I feel absolutely no physical urge to smoke, and what little psychological urge I do feel is negligible. The situatuon is incredibly strange, but I'm really enjoying it. Has anyone had this happen to them?

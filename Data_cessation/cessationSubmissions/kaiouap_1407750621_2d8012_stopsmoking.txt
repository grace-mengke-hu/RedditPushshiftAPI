Changes in blood tests

I take regular blood tests, because I am a blood donor and they screen us very carefully where I live.

Now, compared the last test (pre-quitting) I have *very* low values of iron (hemoglobin, ferritin, anything related).

I didn't change any eating or life habits, except the smoking, my doctor doesn't really care, but I am worried.

Did anyone have similar experiences? Does smoking interfere with the iron metabolism and it needs time to adjust? I can't really find any source about that, just some "smoking lowers iron levels" article.

Thanks!

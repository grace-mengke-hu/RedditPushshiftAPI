A reminder of how disgusting cigarettes are

I was feeling very fidgety, so I started to clean the bathroom.  My husband and I recently moved into an apartment that was previously inhabited by a smoker.  Even though we were smokers we never smoked inside so none of the nicotine stains were from us.  

Anyway, the apartment was not cleaned very well before we moved in because I just spent 20 minutes scrubbing half of our tiny bathroom ceiling and the nicotine stains turned my white washcloth ENTIRELY brown. If I didn't know better I would have thought the washcloth was SUPPOSED to be BROWN.

That is what I used to put in my lungs on a daily basis.  That grossness is what I used to call a "treat" or a "mini relaxation break".  Ew.  That experience just killed my craving.

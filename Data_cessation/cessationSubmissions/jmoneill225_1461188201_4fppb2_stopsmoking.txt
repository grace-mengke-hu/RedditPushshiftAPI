Thank you Mommy

My reason for quitting was really simple. I couldn't explain, or convince l my 5 year old son, that I wasn't trying to kill myself. This is when it became clear that I needed to quit. I am approaching 3 weeks smoke free! As others said, the first two weeks are very hard, but if you stay strong and focused you can do it. I even went out drinking, at a casino where smoking is all around me, and I still made it through the night. After that night, I knew I could get though anything. I starting coloring in a adult coloring book when I felt like I needed to smoke. My son started coloring with me which is so awesome. To think the time that I am spending with him coloring I would have been away from him smoking makes me sad. One day while we were coloring he said, "Thank you Mommy for stop smoking." It made me feel so good that he was proud of me and has given me the strength that I have needed on the tough days!

Smoked my last cigarette 46 hours ago, feel amazing.

I would have been smoking for 10 years after February. Pretty scary for someone who's only 22. Yesterday was by far the worst day. I cried 4 times and threw so many temper tantrums. I didn't think I was going to make it, but I did. Today I feel amazing. Every time I do something that I would do with a cigarette, I just remind myself, "Oh, I don't do that anymore" and shrug it off. I don't really crave it as much as I thought I would. Just feel so blessed to not have horrible cravings and feel as crippled as I have in the past when I've tried to quit! Keeping my mind as positive as possible and reminding myself why I'm doing this and how awesome it is going to be to spend Christmas with my boyfriend's family and not have to plan everything we do around my smoking! Any bad feeling I have while quitting will be so worth it in the end when I can look back at how far I've come and how much better my body feels.

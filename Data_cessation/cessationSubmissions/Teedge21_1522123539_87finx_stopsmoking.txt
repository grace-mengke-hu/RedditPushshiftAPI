Anyone using the Smoke Free App?

I've finished all of the missions... And earned all of the badges (expert those that just need time passed to earn) except for the Citizen Scientist badge. And since I completed all of the missions, I just can't figure out what will trigger it!

I'm not losing sleep over it... But every time I see it sitting there in the grayed out status, it triggers a craving.  I know.. I'm kind of crazy.

What do I have to do to earn it?!?!  I want them all!  Lol

If you aren't using this app... and are looking for one, I highly recommend it!  It was extremely helpful!  (PS if you earn the previously named badge, come and back &amp; let me know what you had to do!)

TIA!

Just realized I broke 100 days.

I quit, using the patch July 11th.  I did the full 10 week program, as directed on the box, and it was the easiest, most painless thing ever!  Getting over those first couple of days are a real struggle unless you get your head in the right place (finally!) but after that it was smooth as glass!  I don't even think about them anymore, even with the wife running out to the back porch every half hour to light up!  You can do it too!  It's totally worth the fight, no matter how long it takes.

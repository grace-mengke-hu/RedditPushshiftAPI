Day 4... Hanging in there!!

For the first time in a long time, my badge is accurate. Before when I come to this subreddit, the first thing I would do is request a new badge. 

Things have changed! According to all the information on the internet, there is no more nicotine in my body!! A side benefit: I've also abstained from drinking, since drinking and smoking is such a lethal combination for me.  I haven't felt this sober in years.  Things are great!

But now, the problem comes with me accepting myself as a non-smoker. Since smoking was completely integrated in my life & personal identity for the past 16 years, the anxiety of being smoke-free was SUPER intense. So intense, I want to smoke again to make it go away.  Good thing my detox battle is still fresh in my head!  

Thanks for reading :)

I'm Still Here

Just checking in because it's been a while.  This is good news; it means I don't think much about smoking ever anymore.

I quit cold turkey. I don't believe relapse is mandatory; I haven't so far. I have anxiety and depression issues and that was never an excuse to start again. I smoked for over 20 years. I didn't plan to quit the day I quit. It wasn't easy. It sucked for the first month.

Having a hard time? Really want this? Send me a message and I'll help out if I can. I can at least tell you what helped me and what I learned from people here that got me through the rough patches.

It's good to be nicotine free. I've saved over Â£1200. 

My quit was hard. So you can also do this. I'm not a superhero, I just needed to quit and I took the advice that  related to me and my situation.

Big shout out to all who helped me!

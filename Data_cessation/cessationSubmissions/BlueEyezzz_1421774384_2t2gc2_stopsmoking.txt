I quit today... making a plan

This is going to be hard. Yesterday I decided I am done and I haven't smoked the whole day. I caved tonight, because my plan isn't solid. It is extremely difficult to my body (Smoked since 19, turned 29 last month), or my mind is just playing tricks. So this evening I spend on making a plan for myself. This evening I am done. That first one smelt aweful and I feel disgusted again. Within the next 4 hours before sleeping I am throwing everything smoke-related out of my house. This is going to be a tough one, but I am up for the challenge.

The Alan Carr book is in front of me, I have read it in the past and will be reading it after I have cleaned my house. The past two months were heavy when it comes to not drinking, today I am marking day 52 of being sober (I have begun to love being sober). Smoking is the next hurdle. Armed with my confidence of not drinking, not smoking is the next step in a better life...

I salute all of you who are struggling and I especially salute all of you who have already quit. This night I will join you non-smokers.... This night I will set the badge, the clock, for the last time...

Will be reading the side-bar as well. If you are willing to give me your best personal tip for quiting, I will be thankful.

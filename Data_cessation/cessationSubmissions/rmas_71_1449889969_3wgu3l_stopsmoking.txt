26 days and saving more money

26 days today. It just so happens 2 days after I decided to quit smoking I bought a new car. It's amazing how people stopped bumming rides when I tell them they can't smoke in my new car. So not only am I saving money on smokes but saving gas and wear and tear on my new car!

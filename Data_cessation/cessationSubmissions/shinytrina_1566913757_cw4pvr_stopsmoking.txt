These are a few of my favourite things

So I am close to a month not smoking and there are so many things I enjoy smelling now that the cloud of smoke has been lifted.

My cat was sitting in the window this morning that was open. There was a slight breeze coming through. When I got out of bed to take a shower she, as normal, jumped off the window ledge and jumped on the bed for some affection before I went to shower. She acts like she will never see me again lol. Anyway I picked her up and she put her head near my nose and she smelt amazing. Reminded me of the smell my grandmother's cats had when they would come in from being outside. So many nice memories came flooding back. :)

Another thing that I notice is how nice my towel smells that I use to shower. It no longer reeks of a mix of cigarette smoke and the smell of a shower, which I always found really seemed to keep the cigarette smell in. Now it just smells like a shower which is amazing.

Also my hair is less oily/greasy. I used to have to wash it every other day when I was smoking as it would get so oily/greasy so quickly. Yesterday it hit me that I am now washing it every 3 to 4 days. 

Sorry this is just a ramble and has no real point to it, besides how happy I am that I am no longer smoking :)

On an odd note, this morning I coughed a dry cough and it let the taste in the back of my throat of like an elastic band. Has anyone else had that taste?

Just hit hour number 60! :)

You guys, it's been a hard few days. But this subreddit is really helping me coast along.
On the second day, I smelled good, there was no ash on me, I didn't have to sneak away from hanging out with good friends just to have a smoke. Everyone at work is super proud of me.

Just need some help with this one:
I'm now savagely hungry. But a full time worker. If I were to get up every morning before work and go for a run, would be I exhausted all day or does it gear you guys up?

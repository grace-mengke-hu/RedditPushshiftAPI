The third day

As of now I'm on day 3 officially. I've stopped many times but this time I'm determined as hell. 

Day 3 is kicking my ass a bit. This morning I woke up feeling enraged, irrational and moody. I'm still going strong as of 4pm and convinced that this won't last long. I hate and fear the third day because this is where I always manage to give in. Looking at all the badges that have made it to weeks, months and years gives me hope and keeps me going.

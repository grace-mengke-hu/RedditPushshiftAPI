I was without any cigarettes for over to months

So, i layed in my bed watching tv and than it came to me, an urge to get the nice cigarettes and how good it is to smoke some. I was to weak i jumped out of my bed, put my shoes on and walked really fast to the cigarettes machine at the street. I have not even tryied to stop myself. And now i am not sure if i should quit again.

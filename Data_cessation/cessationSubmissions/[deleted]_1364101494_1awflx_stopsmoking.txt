I was offered scholarships for soccer as a senior in High School. 3 years later, I'm struggling to climb up the stairs.

I've been smoking casually maybe 3 or 4 times a month between high school to my the start of my jr year of college. I smoke everyday for the last year (both weed and cigs(mostly weed though). I gained 20 pounds since high school. Towards the end of senior year, I was running 8 miles 3 times a week no problem. Today, I was barely able to run a mile. I have become introverted and energy-less. I have lost all my desire. I'm stopping now and starting a new healthy life. I want to run a marathon within the next year. I want to be packed with energy like how I used to be. I'm done with weed, cigs, and even alcohol. I want to be full of life. I'm ready.

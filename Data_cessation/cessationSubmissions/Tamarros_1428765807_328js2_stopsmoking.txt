100 days. HEAL YEAH

I've just returned from a crazy music&meditation festival, and not only did I manage not to smoke, but also noticed just now that It's been 100 since I quit! I honestly feel blessed. I'm a different person, and I gotta say this journy has turned into real ego boost.

From where I'm standing right now, I know I'm never gonna smoke again. I feel amazing. This community has helped me so much, thank you thank you thank you!

(Also, not a native english speaker, so I'm sorry for grammer and such)

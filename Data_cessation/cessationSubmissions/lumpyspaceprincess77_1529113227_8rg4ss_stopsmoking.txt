Mood changes

Hey everyone! I’m 1 week in after 9 years smoking a pack a day! What I haven’t been able to find the answer to is how long the mood changes last? It’s been bad... real bad. So much so that me and my bf have gotten to the point of almost breaking up. We never fought so much In the 2 years of being together as we have this week. Can anyone tell me when your mood levels and goes back to normal? Or maybe how you cope when you get irrationally angry and sad. It feels as if i have very little control when explode

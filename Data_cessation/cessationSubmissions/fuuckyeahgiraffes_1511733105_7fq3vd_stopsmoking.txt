Help. I'm not sure I can quit. Idk what to do...

I want to spend my first winter in 3 years smoke-free. For 3 years cigarettes have been a crutch for me, helping me "stay happy," but now I am in a better place than ever and have been feeling really held back by cigarettes. I want to get in better shape but I get winded quickly. I'm back in school &amp; I work with kids now so cigarettes only serve as a distraction from my studies or cause animosity between myself and my coworkers/supervisors.

My boyfriend wants me to quit, but not in an ultimatum way, more like in a "stay healthy bc I love you" way, and I want to. I think I'm just scared of being without them even though they make my throat hurt and my chest tight. I can't really imagine my normal days without them, even though I want to quit, I don't hesitate to purchase my next $10.84 pack before I run out of the last one. 

I want to change my thinking, but I'm afraid of withdrawal and the slippery slope, I don't want to find out I'm weak. I don't want to quit and then pick it back up and just be a failure. But I know what the right choice is, I just can't convince myself to follow through.

Try- try again

I was nailing quitting last week.  Friday night I could not get past my hubby sitting on the patio
Smoking it up and enjoying the beautiful spring evening we had.  I caved - and continued to cave all weekend.  He is switching to chew today.  (So I donâ€™t have to watch him smoke)-  I am using the patch- so I suppose we are both giving up the carbon monoxide.  Wish us luck.

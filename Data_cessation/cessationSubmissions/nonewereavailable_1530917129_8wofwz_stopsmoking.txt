Yayy Day7

I have tried 5 times before, the maximum days i lasted was 4 days. Really proud of getting through the weekend and weekday. Something that helped me were cloves, it kinda mimics the burn and suppresses the cravings a lot. You guys should definitely try chewing cloves when craving arises.

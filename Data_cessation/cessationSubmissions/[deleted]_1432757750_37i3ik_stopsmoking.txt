My name is ichorous007 and I am addicted to cigarettes.

I just want to share my first actual step and a bit of my story. I started smoking cigarettes when I was 15. I loved smoking weed, hookahs, occasional cigars but I always enjoyed cigarettes with weed, coffee, after meals, with alcohol and even during masturbation. 

I have asthma. My lungs hurt sometimes and I am experiencing shortness of breath after 15 years of smoking. Now I was never a pack a day smoker. Some days I would leave them home usually Monday - Friday during work and not even crave one cig. After dinner I would have one and that was it mostly. I have always smoked the heaviest when drinking alcohol. I could rip through 10 cigarettes in a night no problem. I thought I had everything under control. 

Then I exited a long term relationship. I started smoking with the morning coffee on my way to work, after my lunch at work, on the drive home from work, after dinner and maybe another before bed. I let it spiral out of control for me and I lost control for my own personal standards. I now let nicotine cravings control me more than I like ( I always felt like I had the willpower). I now smoke like 2-3 packs a week when it used to be one pack a week. I want to quit this because I can feel this is just getting progressively worse. 

Today I bought a pack of cigarettes and smoked two in less than three hours of opening them. I then just bought some nicotine gum online to help me ween off the nicotine and curb those cravings. I am making the steps to regain control of my mind and body.

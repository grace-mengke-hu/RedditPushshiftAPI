Question about quitting smoking and how it affects caffeine

I quit smoking yesterday and had insomnia last night. I also took chantix which may have caused it.

Anyways, I've read that quitting nicotine will cause your body to process caffeine slower and read that I should cut my caffeine consumption in half.

The problem I've had in the past with tapering down on caffeine is that I would get really depressed by tapering too quickly. If I go from drinking two cups of coffee per day to one cup of coffee per day then will I get caffeine withdrawal from this? Or will the higher caffeine levels in my body (from quitting nicotine) cancel this out?

I don't really want to be withdrawing from caffeine and nicotine at the same time but I do need to not have insomnia at night.

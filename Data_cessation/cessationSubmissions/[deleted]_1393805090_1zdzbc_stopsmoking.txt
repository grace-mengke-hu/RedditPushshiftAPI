There's no sidebar advice here so I need to ask. I'm quitting today cold turkey and decided to be absolutely sober for the next two months to go with it. Can anyone give me a rough guide to kick the habit?

I am so sick of relying on smoking and drinking and drugs to ease my nerves, I need to be in control of my life so I need all your help.

I have tried and failed at quitting smoking so many times, like every two weeks and I have been avid for 6 years.

What are the first steps to take and what else could I do to ease my cravings and make sure not to pick it up again?

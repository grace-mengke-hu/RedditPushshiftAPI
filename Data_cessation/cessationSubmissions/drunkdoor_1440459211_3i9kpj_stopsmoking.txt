I see a lot of people saying you have to "want" to quit. I personally didn't want to quit at all.

I really didn't want to quit at all. I quit 3 years ago for almost 2 years, then smoked for about 9 months again and I've recently decided to quit again. Honestly though, I don't want to have quit at all. Smoking was really fun and helped me mingle easier socially. I decided to quit purely for (a) the health benefits and (b) to not stink for my friends/family. Is this a recipe for failure? Are there any other long term smokers who have quit for a long time who just plain loved smoking and didn't really want to quit?

18 days smoke free

Somethings that have helped me quit smoking
The smoke free app has helped remind me of how far I have come each day and everything I am gaining from my decision to quit 
Gum, gum, gum. Especially in the car and after I am done eating. It helps occupy the oral fixation. 
Researching blogs and reading about other people’s journeys while quitting smoking. 
NRT patches. Everyone asks me do they really work. They do not make you quit smoking only you can do that. They are a tool that help you quit smoking. 
The gym. I started doing cardio again and the runners high clears my head and curbs cravings for a day. It also helps relieve stress which is important as you don’t feel like you have an outlet. 
Telling everyone around me I quit has helped keep me accountable. 
Talking in the phone while in the car has helped keep my mind of smoking. 
I changed some daily routine items to help break old habits. 
Journaling the experience. It is a time for reflection and selfishness.

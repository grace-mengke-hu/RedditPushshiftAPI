Day 22... I think I can start feeling a bit proud?

3 weeks and I can tell now that the worst is over and gone. Still have cravings every now and then, the anxiety levels have dropped and don't feel as sad as 2 weeks ago. The 4 Ds work, drinking cold water, sport so not putting on weight are key. But for some reason I still don't believe in myself and don't think I'm an ex smoker. Is the furthest I've ever come after 22 years as a smoker. Why I feel like this? Thanks all for your support! We can do this! ☺️

Advice for the future

I had my last cig/joint on the 27th December. I wanted to quit for a long time then suddenly, I just lost interest in it and the taste too. Haven't been that tempted since really but it's still early days and I was wondering if anyone has any tips to help me keep this up. I'm really happy for going this long, I have surprised myself.

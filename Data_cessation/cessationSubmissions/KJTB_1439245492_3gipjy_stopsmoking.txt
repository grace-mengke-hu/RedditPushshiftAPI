Day 7 of no smoking, how to help the headache?

Hey guys!

So at the beginning of this year I made the poor choice of smoking cigarettes during a self sabotaging time of my life. Fortunately I'm out of my rut but I continued to smoke cigarettes. Last week I decided that I was done smoking and quit cold turkey. I was smoking at least half a pack a day.

It hasn't been as bad as I thought it would be but I've had a constant dull headache everyday. For some reason the headache today is the worst one. It's really distracting and uncomfortable which is bad because my summer school class final is this week. I keep getting intrusive thoughts like "well, just smoke a bit this week to get through the final" which I dont and won't do but I'll admit that it's taxing to constantly battle with myself. For those of you who quit, did you have any strategies or ways to cope with the withdrawal symptoms?

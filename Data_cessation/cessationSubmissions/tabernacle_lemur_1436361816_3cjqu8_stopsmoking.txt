31 days...now for the tricky part

I hit 31 days today! (woop!) This is the longest I have ever stayed quit before.  In the past the "one month" mark was an excuse to start smoking again as I would commit to 30-day cleanses or challenges of some kind and would make not smoking part of that challenge.  Once the challenge was over, time to light up!  I had earned it!

Not this time, this is the real deal.  I am not having nearly as many cravings as I thought I would by this point, however some recent posts on here have been a good reminder about staying vigilant and not falling for the "just one" brain trickery down the road.

I still miss it sometimes but not enough to light up.  Anyway, thanks to everyone on here who has been so motivating for me!  And if you are just starting the process, quitting is not easy but it does get easier and the time does kind of fly by!

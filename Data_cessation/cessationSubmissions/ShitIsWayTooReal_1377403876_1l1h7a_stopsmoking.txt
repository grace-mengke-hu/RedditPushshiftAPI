3 weeks down, never felt a craving to smoke

Regardless of if you buy into Allen Carr or the hypnotherapy stop smoking methods, it's a fact that the language we use when talking to ourselves and others effects how we feel and act.

Addiction is rooted in the unconscious (emotional) brain, making it vital that our words carry the appropriate emotional connotations when we talk/think about quitting. The emotional brain doesn't register the words themselves or even the intent behind why they were said, it only registers the emotions associated with the words. 

"Craving" carriers several emotional connotations that simply don't apply. It implies we'll feel a sense of joy and satisfaction with we satisfy the urge. I can't speak for anyone else here but I've never felt those two emotions after giving up and smoking a cig.

We crave easier breathing, better circulation, and more energy; we feel a compulsion to smoke. 

Replacing "craving" with "compulsion" in how you think about the situation can have a surprising effect. Your emotional brain stops associating fulfillment of the urge with a positive outcome (we crave things we want) and starts associating it with a neutral/negative outcome (we can be compelled to do anything, even things we hate).

Being careful in choosing our language gives our conscious mind, the part that decided we needed to change, the kind of leverage it needs to maintain self control.

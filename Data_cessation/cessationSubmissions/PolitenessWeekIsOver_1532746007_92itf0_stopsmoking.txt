Took 3 small puffs yesterday

I had a hard week and I think I am depressed (I have a history of mental illness in my family ) and I have contracted HPV I think. The one good thing that happened in this year is that I quit smoking. And yesterday I felt like I threw it all away. 3 puffs. They weren't even my normal puffs. I don't think I even inhaled. Then I threw it away. 

I was alone, in another country and I just couldn't handle it. I was successful at one thing for a month and then I just threw it away.

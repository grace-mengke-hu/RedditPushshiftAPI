This time it sticks

This is my 4th, maybe 5th attempt. In the past I tried telling friends, family etc that I was quitting, and even though the support was great, I've decided it was the wrong form of encouragement for me. I prefer praise for a job well done, rather than a pat on the back for trying again. 

So this time round I'm not telling anyone (except you). Not for 7 days. That is longer than I've ever gone without a smoke since I started, and I truly believe that the look on my parents faces after telling them I'm smoke free for a week will make however many more days I have ahead of me so much easier.

Here we go.  http://www.imgur.com/y1rkHDX

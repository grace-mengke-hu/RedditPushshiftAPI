How accurate is the Smoke Free app’s biological countdowns?

I know they use generally accepted “In most cases” number of hours for things like nicotine removal, energy, and taste/smell recovery but I’ve hit all those goals and don’t feel like I’ve regained any of those. I’ve been a moderate smoker for 10 years now and just hit 4 days. I’m just curious to know how long other people’s recovery times were.

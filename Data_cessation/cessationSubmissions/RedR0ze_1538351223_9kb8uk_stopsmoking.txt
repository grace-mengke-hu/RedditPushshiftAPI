Threw out a collection of action figures because of smoke smell

They were 1992-1993 Star Trek action figures, about 20 of them with some doubles.  I'm not too upset about their value otherwise I would've tried more to save them (they're between $7-$15 each depending).  I'm mostly upset that I was dumb enough to have them on display when I was smoking inside the house.  I've since moved and stopped smoking altogether.  When I moved I put them in a plastic bucket until I could display them again.  That was 3 years ago.

I recently bought a nice large display case and went to assemble them again.  I couldn't stop smelling cigarettes.  I thought I was just being sensitive and it wasn't that bad.  It's been 3 years since I quit cigarettes and 1 year since I stopped vaping. 

 I finally got the figures nice and arranged in the case and closed the doors, took a step back to admire, then went to open it up to adjust one and got smacked in the face with ash tray smell.  My heart sank.  I did not want the smell to leach into my non-smoke-smelling figures.  I didn't want anybody who opened the case to get a face full of stale cigarette smoke.  They had to go.  Looking closer, a handful of them were even discolored from the tar (particularly Data and Troi's faces and Chekov and McCoy's arms).  

Good news is they're cheap for collectibles, bad news is I've had these since I was a kid.  I even held on to all their accessories and only lost a couple of stands.  I'll have to slowly replace them.  I'm still kicking myself for having these on display while me and my ex (and all his friends) were smoking inside the house.  

**Take this as another reason to stop smoking.  Or at least don't display anything in the house if you smoke indoors that's precious to you because it will smell like an ashtray.**

TLDR; I smoked indoors with my Star Trek figures on display.  Now that I've stopped smoking, I can't stand the smell/tar damage and had to throw them out.

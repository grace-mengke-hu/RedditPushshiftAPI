32yo, 18y habit

I was a pack a day or more for most of my 18 years. I quit about 8-9 years ago for exactly 12 months. Idk why I started again after that. I remember buying that first pack and wondering why the hell I was doing it. After that I have been a pack every two day smoker, unless I drink, then I can smoke a pack or two a night, but I don't really drink much anymore. When I was leaving punta Cana in September I bought 3 carton's for real cheap and said (like I've said 1,000 times) I'll quit when these are gone. As I got into the third carton I decided that I really will quit, because I really don't enjoy it anymore. So I started paying attention to how much I smoked, and limiting myself to 2hrs between smokes, to get a head start on acquainting myself that feeling of withdrawal. But I could go 6 hours without smoking, no problem... I'm on hour 18 or so right now, and I'm going to kick this thing for real this time. The hardest part is the minutes leading up to the moments when I would normally smoke. I haven't smoked in my cars for 14 years, so that isn't an issue, but when I go somewhere, I always smoke as soon as I get back to the house. I went to the vet today and the drive home was intense. I always smoke first thing when I get to work. So the ride to work was intense. I'll make it though. I really want to quit, and when I really want something, I always get it. When I have a urge, I've just told myself "not now. if you're gonna fail and smoke another one, it's not gonna be now." Saying that has really helped take the edge off. Here's looking towards hour 19.

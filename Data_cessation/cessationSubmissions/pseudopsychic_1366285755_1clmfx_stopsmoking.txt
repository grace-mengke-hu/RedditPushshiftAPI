One with the universe

Say these words aloud: “I am *never* done growing.”

As the universe is ever expansive and will never stop growing, you as a manifestation of the universe are ever expansive and will never stop growing.

Why would you ever think that this growth would end? Why would ever think that your power as a manifestation of the *fucking universe* would know any bounds? There are no bounds. There is no end.

Stop looking for the power. Stop looking for the answer. You *are* the power. You *are* the answer. You *will* succeed. This truth is inevitable. This truth is already happening.

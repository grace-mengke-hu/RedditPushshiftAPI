My Chantix Experience and what about tapering off of it?

As of the 20th of August, 30 days smoke free. (Was smoker for 25+ years). For myself, it has been a lifesaver with minimum side effects. A little nausea and weird af dreams but I actually enjoyed them tbh!! Always had vivid dreams anyway..feel like a flip has been switched in my brain...really no issues with depression and irritability until just recently. Not enough to be overly concerned but I am thinking maybe to start tapering off completely to quit taking altogether? Oh, I have already tapered off to 1 mg a couple of weeks ago. Would go to doctor but just rehired and waiting for benefits to kick in. Sorry for the long post!

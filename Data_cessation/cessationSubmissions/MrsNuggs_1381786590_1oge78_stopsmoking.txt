8 weeks ago things changed

8 weeks ago I was diagnosed with a stroke at 37 years old. This was a huge shock for me, and I took it as a wake up call to quit smoking and get healthy. This last week has been really hard. I had to go back to the hospital because all my symptoms were back, and they were worse. I thought maybe I had over done it and worked too hard. Then I thought maybe I was having another stroke. Well, we still don't know what's wrong for sure, but now the docs think I have MS. I'm terrified. My whole life has changed, and I have no idea what the future holds now. One year ago I was celebrating my 10 year wedding anniversary by spending a week in Mexico. This year we spent a week in the hospital. I want to smoke right now. I'm not going to. I know it won't make me feel any better, and could actually make my symptoms way worse, but that doesn't stop me from wanting to smoke. Anyway, I'm having a down moment. A little pity party for one. I really scared, but I'm not going to smoke.

Hives on my Face

Hey everyone - I'm two weeks in to my quit and 3 days ago I had a crucial breakout of hives on my face that stayed there until I got a few steroids to take them down. 

Anyone experience any sort of rashes or hives following a quit? I've quit before but this is my first hive experience. I've thought a lot about it and this is the only clear change I've made over the past couple weeks...

With that being said, my cravings have gone down immensely and my mind feels way more clear/less stressed. I AM experiencing a lot of drowsiness still but hopefully that subsides after a month.

Let a guy know if you've felt the hives!

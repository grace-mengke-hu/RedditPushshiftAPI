What is wrong with me?

I stopped smoking thurs 7pm I use very min amount (2mg) gum 10 pieces the whole time. First 24 hrs I had diffucult time but today I had to call off work and call my dr bc I felt like I was having a panic attack. On top of that I could not stop crying but I am not sad I just feel overwelmed and frankly really stupid. How normal is this?? My dr app is tommorow but I want to hear from others so I feel less out of control.

First time quitting, didn't expect it to be so painful!

Hey, I've lurked here but never posted before. This is my second day of not smoking, and I feel terrible. I've been smoking daily for 3 years and I always had this logic like "well, I'll just quit before I get too old". This sounds pretty stupid, but somehow it just hit me a few weeks ago that when people talk about the predictable consequences of smoking, they're talking about *me*. And that if I keep smoking, I don't think I'll be any more eager to quit in two or five years.

My first day was relatively okay, but now I feel like I'm in hell. I cried for three hours earlier and couldn't even bring myself to leave the house because I can't smoke. I was naive going into this and didn't expect it to be that bad because it's not like smoking brings me any real happiness. How wrong I was. If I were getting sober from alcohol or drugs at least those things bring people euphoria, but how am I *crying* over not being able to smoke a cigarette?

I'm still confident in my decision though. This process is making me realize how ingeniously designed cigarettes must be for us to crave them so much when they bring (me at least) so little true satisfaction.

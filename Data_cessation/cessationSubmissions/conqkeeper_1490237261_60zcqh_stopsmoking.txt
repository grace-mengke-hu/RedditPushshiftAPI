How do I finally get off them..

Have been working on quitting and have successfully   gotten from smoking atleast a half pack a day to 4-5 a day...tried going down to 2 today and my body couldn't take it...I felt so  out of it and shitty all day...I don't want to get on patches or anything... I just don't know what to do.

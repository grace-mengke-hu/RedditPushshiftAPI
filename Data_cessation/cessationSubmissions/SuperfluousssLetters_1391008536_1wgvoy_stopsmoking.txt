Create your own perfect storm of improvement

I've been lingering on this subreddit for quite some time but finally took the next step 10 days ago. My method if quitting was a bit unorthodox; I bought a few packs of Marlboro reds and smoked as many as I could in a 2 day period. The goal was to feel so sick that I would have no choice. Needless to say it worked, so far.

Since quitting I've been on a bit of an upswing and decided that I wanted to maximize this surge of power. 4 days ago I started /r/nofap. It's been on my mind to jump on that bandwagon (by the way I do recommend everyone check out that subreddit. It is way more than just not masturbating, it's about harnessing your life). Anyways, along with nofap, I also decided that I won't be drinking or smoking weed for at least another month. The purpose is to practice mindfulness and self control.

Ultimately that's what quitting cigarettes is all about. Sure you could isolate yourself from all your smoking buddies, or run away from scenarios where smoking is almost guaranteed but that's no way to live life. I went to a party this last weekend and, quite drunk, stood in the MIDDLE of the smoking circle. Why? Because I wanted to stare that bull of a problem and spit in its proverbial face.

Ladies and gentlemen, we all have the power to quit. If you are reading this and still apprehensive about quitting, this post probably won't change your mind. But when you do eventually decide to take that leap, embrace the challenge and remember that it is ALL about controlling your impulses. Thanks for listening, and good luck :)

A lot of firsts this weekend

First solo drive without smoking (I almost never smoke with passengers in the car but always smoked when I was alone) and first time when I had the opportunity to smoke I didn't. On day 3 now and have the 'jimmy legs' and I'm moody and irritable. Going to pick up a vape pen tonight. Thanks for the support, even though you may not realize it

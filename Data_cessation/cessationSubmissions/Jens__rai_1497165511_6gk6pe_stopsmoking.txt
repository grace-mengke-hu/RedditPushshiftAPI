finally found the motivation I needed

I'd been smoking for nine years. Started when I was 22, stupid, way after I should have been out of the danger zone. I've tried to quit a few times over the past three years and never made it more than two weeks. 

Fast-forward to last month when my cousin, who is infertile, asked me if I would donate some of my egg cells for her. They'll go to someone else anonymously and she gets bumped up all the way to the top of the waiting list (which is more than five years). Only downside: I can only donate egg cells if I haven't smoked even one cigarette for at least six months. 

I'm almost at one month now. I've convinced myself a million times that it really wouldn't hurt to smoke one cigarette, and then I think of how pissed my cousin would be. And how happy she will be to get pregnant and have a child. 

I never managed to quit for myself, but I can do it for her.

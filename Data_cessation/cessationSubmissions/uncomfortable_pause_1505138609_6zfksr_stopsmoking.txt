Day 60 without smoking, day 4 without nicotine

Friday 8 Sep was my day 1 without any nicotine at all.  I stopped the lozenges and am without a crutch.  The first 72h weren't too bad!  I had an absolutely awful Friday (for non-nicotine reasons) but didn't smoke, didn't even take the last lozenge I'm keeping on hand in case of emergencies.  I thought I would be smoking more weed to help with cravings but nope, smoking less and strongly considering quitting entirely.

I'm done with nicotine, tobacco, cigarettes, all of it.   I'm ready to be better.

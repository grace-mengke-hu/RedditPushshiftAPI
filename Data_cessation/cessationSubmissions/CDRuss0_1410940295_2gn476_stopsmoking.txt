Coming up on 4 weeks

Not sure if my flair is correct. I guess I'll know after this post. But I'm feeling strong. The smell, which used to trigger cravings, is now pretty repulsive. I'm feeling the effects as my body transitions, and the difference in my breathing is drastic. You don't really feel it until the nicotine leaves your system, but wow. My lungs can never seem to catch a full breath, my sinuses are swollen, my throat is uncomfortable constantly, my voice has even been changing, and all things considered its a pretty miserable transition and I'll be happy when its over. But still, I'm coming up on 4 weeks strong. I can manage some light aerobic exercise, which helps expel the mucus, which helps to clear up my breathing, if only until my body cools down. My skin has more color and the bags around my eyes are disappearing. Its slow, sure. I'm less than 4 weeks in, but seeing improvement every day when I look in the mirror is a constant motivator. When I see the mucus in the drain I'm only more motivated to keep getting it the hell out of my body. The only time I've wanted to smoke is when I've been drunk. So I've stopped drinking to excess, just a few beers here and there. I've been improving my diet as well. I do hope that with more time my hair will also start to see some repair. Looking at old photos, its pretty dramatic how much my hair thinned after even just my first few months of smoking. Thanks to everyone who posted words of encouragement when I relapsed 4 weeks ago. It was a big help :)

Remind me again?

Hey everyone, 

I had my last cigarette on September 11, 2015. That means tomorrow will be 5 months since I quit. 

Personally, I quit using the Allen Carr method. I know it doesn't work for everyone but until recently I was doing well: no cravings, committed to quitting etc. However in the last week I've really been wanting to smoke. By this I mean that I'm having cravings similar to what I can remember from when I tried just white knuckling it in the past. Worst of all, I'm at that point in recovery where I'm so far removed from my decision to quit that I find myself searching for a reason why not to just buy myself my old pack of Camel's and light up with my morning coffee. 

Has anyone else experienced this? I was hoping some of you on here could help remind me why quitting was a good decision by sharing some of your stories.

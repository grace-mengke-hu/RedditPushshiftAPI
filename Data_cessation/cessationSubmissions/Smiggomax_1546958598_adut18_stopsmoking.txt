5 Hours....

No, srsly... 5 Hours and im really fighting. Its try Number 5826 or something. 15-20 cigs per day for about 12 years and i reached the point where i just HATE it from any perspective. Even my loved first one of the day with coffee smells disgusting. Shame on me, lost my mom 7 Years ago because of cancer. Im so Done with this senseless Shit. Wish me the best, guys. I wish you too.

I want to quit but not really sure how to approach it.

I'm 27. Have smoked since 18, but not daily and consistent until 22. My father had a ruptured aneurysm in September (he survived, but barely) and seeing as both I may have a genetic susceptibility to aneurysm formation and smoking is one of the biggest risk factors, I'm literally scared shitless every time I've had a cigarette since this happened. I smoke between half a pack and a pack a day, usually closer to a pack. 

One thing that may or may not factor into this is the fact that I've been through opiate withdrawal in the past due to a severe injury that had me on opiates for a couple years. Honestly the withdrawals were so terrible even with tapering that it made me nervous to deal with nicotine withdrawals even though in theory I know they should be significantly less troublesome. 

What do you guys think is the best route to take? I've tried the patches and gum previously but I still feel, even on them, like I need a cig and I don't feel like they really work for me. What about tapering with an e-cig? Thanks guys, appreciate any and all advice. 

Edit: Should probably mention my wife also smokes and isn't ready to quit yet although she is very supportive of me quitting. I think that will make it tougher for sure :/

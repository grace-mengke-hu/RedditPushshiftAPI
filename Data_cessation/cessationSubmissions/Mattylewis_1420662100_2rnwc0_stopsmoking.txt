7 days at midnight

I've been smoking since I was 13 & have tried to give up before 
This will be my third attempt 
I hope I suceed this time around I think I'm doing well so far but especially today I've found I've been eating loads which I certainly don't want to do :( 
Just wish my partner would give up too now as he stinks lol

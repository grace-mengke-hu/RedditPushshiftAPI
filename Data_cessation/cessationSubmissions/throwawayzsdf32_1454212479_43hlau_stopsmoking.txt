Quitting gradually

TL;DR I started smoking about 1-2 months ago, stupidly thinking I wouldn't get hooked and just start smoking socially/occasionally. Gradually I've raised my smoking from a few cigs a week, to once a day, to now about 3 a day. I'm trying to stop myself here but trying to quit cold turkey seems impossible, i get terrible headaches and can't focus or sleep.

Basically my question is if cutting down a cigarette a day each week is a good idea, or substitute it with dip or a vape or something until I can quit nicotine all together. I just want to stop it here. Anyone with experience that can help would be appreciated

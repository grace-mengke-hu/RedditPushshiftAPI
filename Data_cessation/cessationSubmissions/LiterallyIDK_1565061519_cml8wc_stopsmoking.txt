Girlfriend [F23] recently stopped smoking. How can I [M23] best support her?

The title is pretty much self-explanatory. I'm a nonsmoker with asthma who doesn't do super well around second-hand smoke, and even though I've never told my girlfriend I want her to quit (instead of saying that if she wants to quit to only do it when she is ready and wants to quit), I'm really happy for her and want to support her. How can I support her, especially since we're about to be long-distance again?

My girlfriend recently decided to quit smoking after having been a smoker since she was 14 years old. Even though most of her family still smokes and is currently living with them, she was a closet smoker. For the last year, she has talked about quitting at some point soon, but her weight was the main reason keeping her from stopping. Now she is worried about weight gain but has tried to eat and cook healthier. As of posting this, she is about 5 days cigarette-free.

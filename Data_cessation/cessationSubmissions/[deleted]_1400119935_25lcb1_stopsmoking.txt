Fuck it. I'm done.

I can't stand this shit anymore. I found out my "allergies" and popping ears were actually a sinus blockage and infection caused by smoking. YAY!

I've tried vaping and i've tried gum, neither worked. I think its time to "man up" and quit cold turkey.





I installed the Quitnow! app on my phone so I hope that helps.

Cheers

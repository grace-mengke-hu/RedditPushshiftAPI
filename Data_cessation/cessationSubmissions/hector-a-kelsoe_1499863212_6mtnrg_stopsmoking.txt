Final attempt after several. Not a single puff. Starting today.

Been smoking a pack a day for the last 20 years. Have quitted before in the last decade, sometimes many months, but always relapsed.

Changing my perspective on smoking (thanks Allen Carr) didn't stop my addiction, but helped me a lot in my thinking. Quitting with NRT didn't work. Willpower didn't work. Tabex didn't work. It is easy to get disillusioned when the addiction seems to be stronger than anything.

I think, in the end, it is a decision you make. I don't want the mental shadow of future misery in the back of mind all the time. I want to be free of smoking. 

The first week can be tough. After that I will disassociate good times with cigarettes and mourn the part of my identity and my habits I need to let go. One puff means a full relapse, be aware, always.

This is my final attempt.
I don't smoke.

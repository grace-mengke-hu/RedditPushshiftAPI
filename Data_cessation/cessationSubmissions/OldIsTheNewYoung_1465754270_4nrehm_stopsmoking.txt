28 days later

28 days no cigarettes after 23 years of smoking.

I never thought I could do it. 
(Funny: Right at the moment I was typing this I was asked for a lighter, while sitting outside a pub and I smiled and said "No")

I smoked between 25 and 35 a day and had a year where I vaped only but fell back because I never really wanted to quit. 

3 months ago I broke 2 ribs and it was the worst pain I ever experienced. It got better but 4 weeks ago I broke one of them again due to coughing. 
That was it. The tiny little thing I needed to get out of it. 

The coughing decreased extremely but I know it takes way more time for my rib to heal. 
After that I'll have a talk with my doctor because the coughing is chronic (and very dry). I already had problems with my bronchia(?)  before I started smoking. 

I think right now I'm on a high a lot of people have after a month and I try to "use" that momentum. 

If anyone speaking German is on here:
Look for Stefan Fr√§drichs Nichtraucher videos on youtube. They helped me a lot understanding what my addiction really is about and that it doesn't make any sense to smoke. 

Cheers!

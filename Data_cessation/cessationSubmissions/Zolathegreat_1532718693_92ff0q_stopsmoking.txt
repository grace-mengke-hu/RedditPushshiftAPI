You find new love

When you are a smoker, your whole life is about smoking. When you quit, you regain love toward other things like books, driving, exercise. It's amazing. You have motivation for many things. But it takes time, don't expect it the first day you quit.Anyway, enjoy your new life as a non smoker!

P.S. if you are still a smoker, what are you wating for? You won't regret your quit.

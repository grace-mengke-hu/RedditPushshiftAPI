Day 8!!!

A smoker for the last 6 years just made it 8 days. I've found drinking lots of water and walking really helps. My goal is obviously to never smoke again but at the moment just trying to make it to 100 days.
It's different for everyone but does anyone have a rough idea of when I will feel less angry? I pretty much want to rip my face off 24/7 at the moment.

Need a few hours reprieve

I am serial relapser, who struggles to concentrate while smoking. 

I'm not looking for advice on that (I'm saturated with it already).

The long term goal is ALWAYS to stop completely, but right now I just need to focus on a few hours break from the disruptive toxicity of my habit and be productive.

I will AT LEAST not smoke until 10pm (app. 5 hours) 

That's about all I can focus on right now.

Peace.

Day Three

The first day for me was by far the easiest although I was at a graduation party and part of my group of friends were smokers. I was busy and surrounded by a lot of people and distractions. I never even felt compelled to try to smoke. Except that night I could not for the life of me fall asleep.
The second day the craving grew. I spent most of the day with my family. My sister and her husband came to my parents house for fathers day. Both smokers. He lit one right in front of me. At first it didn't bother me, but after a few minutes I had to leave. I had an excuse to run back home anyway. So I left and ran home, took the long way to return. It was actually really nice to just take a drive and listen to music and find out I can enjoy it just as much with out a smoke, that was one of my favorite times to smoke.
Today though, the cravings have turned to urges. Almost like my body wants to go on its own and find a cigarette. Thankfully that doesn't last nearly long enough for me to actually act. Even with that being said this is still easier than what I had imagined in my head before quitting. And I'm hoping that tomorrow will be easier.

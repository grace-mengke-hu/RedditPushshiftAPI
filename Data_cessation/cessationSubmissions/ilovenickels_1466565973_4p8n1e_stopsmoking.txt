I am struggling to quit

Hi all,

I am really struggling to quit. 30 year old female, I started smoking when I was 17. I quit for 2 years, plus a month to six months here and there. I always seemed to do okay quitting, but struggled to "stay quit" if that makes sense. 

My wife is a Veteran. She was exposed to burn pits and lately the smell of cigarettes is really bugging her. So I know I should quit, but I am really struggling to quit for some reason. My mental health has been all over the place, and I got some bad news health wise. There seems to be a lot of unknowns in my life right now with my job and all the things going on. Smoking is my "last vice" if you will. I know it's terrible though, and I want to be healthy again and in shape.

As far as quitting: I can't do Wellbutrin or Chantix. And I'm allergic to the patches. Vaping also makes my craving worse. 

I know it's a matter of will right now, but damn I am really struggling compared to the past in regards to quitting. 

Any advice? I am struggling so much right now :(

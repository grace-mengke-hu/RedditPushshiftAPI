I'm on day 15 !!!!! *happy dance*

I am so freaking happy right now. Passed the fortnight of no smoking yesterday. Overall it has actually been an amazing experience. Sure I have had a couple of *really* hard points where I've been so freaking tempted but the majority of the time I have been absolutely fine. The best thing is I already feel so much healthier. My cough - gone! My wheezy chest - gone! I can walk quickly without my lungs hurting like a bitch after 10 minutes. My clothes/hair stinking of ciggie smoke - no more, buster!!  People have been commenting that I no longer look like death warmed up, I have some colour to me/rosy cheeks, they are noticing my cough is gone, they are saying to me how positive I am and how I have a bounce in my step now when I walk. I'm not a slave to smoking any more, I don't have to plan my entire day around when I can have a smoke. It is so bloody brilliant. I'm also proving to myself daily that hey, I am strong and if I put my mind to something, I'll bloody well stick it out. So it's also helping my confidence to no ends.

It's even affecting me day to day in ways I didn't imagine; ie. my work days no longer drag like hell because I'm not having to clock watch, counting the minutes until I can get for my next ciggie. So I'm more productive in work (apart from just now when I'm typing this... haha) and the days are flying by for me.

This is the freaking best thing I have ever done. My next step is getting a cross-trainer this week (which I am mainly paying for with my "smoking" money). If my chest/lungs are clearing up I want to make good use of those beauties. Two birds with one stone - no smoking, lose weight = kick arse! Yay!

Sorry for the ramble just to get it out there. Feel like I could burst today and already looking like a crazy person in the office sitting smiling to myself :D

My SO is attempting to quit. What can I do to support her?

She's quitting after 10+ years using Zyban to help. She's currently at about 1 pack/day. 

What kinds of things can I do to help her get through cravings and withdrawal symptoms? What do smokers attempting to quit want to hear from those supporting them? 

Are there any distractions or strategies that I can suggest? Anything that I should expect? 

Thanks in advance!

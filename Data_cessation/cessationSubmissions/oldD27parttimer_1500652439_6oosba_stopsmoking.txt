37 year smoker day 11 and almost caved in

My brain kept punching me in the gut or lungs early this morning.
This lasted for about an hour.
Go buy a pack, go buy a pack..........
I'm on day 7 of no nicotine.

Well I took a shower and kept thinking to myself...
lung cancer, copd, emphasema, heart attack, stroke, gum disease.
Plus at 7 days no nicotine hopefully it will start getting better and do I want to do these days over again.
I don't want to start over!! I can do this and we can do this!

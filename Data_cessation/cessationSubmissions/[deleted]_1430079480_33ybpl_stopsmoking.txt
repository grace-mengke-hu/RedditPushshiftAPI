4 weeks and 2 days. And I still feel emotionally unstable!

As the title says, I gave up 4 weeks and 2 days ago. I figured it wouldn't be easy, and I'm proud to have gotten so far, but I am still waiting for my emotions to settle a little! I get angry, sad, frustrated, with only the occasional happy bit. It has been a part of my routine for years, and it feels like a piece of my life is missing. Does it really get any easier? I've been smoking for around 22-ish years. I stopped for a bit around 10 years ago, then took it back up and have been going ever since. Help!

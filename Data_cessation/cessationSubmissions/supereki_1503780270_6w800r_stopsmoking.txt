I quit because I was pissed

I tried countless times. From few days to a month, always failed. And since I run, hike, bike it was devastating, I always was the only one that smoked. One months ago I had to climb two summits over 5000m. The guy who lead the expedition thought I won't climb the summits, because he didn't know me. Just saw me as the smooker, aldought I was fitter and with better condition than 70% of the people in the expedition. Long story short, I was pissed that someone could have such opinion of me only because I smoked. I had to prove, not to him, but to me that I'm stronger, smarter and that I can do it. And I did, over two months now, smoke free. I climbed the summits. But not with the asshole who thought I wouldn't make it. Or maybe I should say thank you.

I have not smoked in about 12 days...and im oddly really happy

so i switched to e-cig a month ago this day, then i stopped smoking nicotine 12 days ago, and since 3-4 days ago, i have been feeling really happy. the opposite when i switched to e-cigs, witch i felt kinda depressed. then couple days after stopping nicotine, i felt really happy. like emotionally, mentally, i smoked a pack for 13 years, and when i started, i was really outgoing, confident, then i had anxiety, i thought from weed i used to smoke, and i quit that, then i quit drinking, then i quit caffene, they all helped, but now quitting nicotine, my happiness went through the roof. it was like my brain switched back to 13 years ago.  Now i love it, but i feel its too good to be true, and sometimes i feel like i might be going crazy mentally, i know, people i mentioned this too, say if your feeling happy then feel happy, but me and my worrying mind, kind of needs to know, why? and i always think of the worst, and to me as of right now, this happiness is the process of me literately going crazy....I hope not, i just want to know, is this normal? what were your experiences like? My friend tells me (he quit at the same time) he does not feel any different. if anybody can help, that would be great!

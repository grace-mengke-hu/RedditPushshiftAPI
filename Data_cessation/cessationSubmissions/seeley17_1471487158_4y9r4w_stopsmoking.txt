Does anyone else get extremely mad at people after being 2 weeks with out smoking?

I use to be extremely passive. Take my frustration out on smoking. Now I've been extremely close to fist fights and alot of name calling. I look at what happened now with a clearer head and still think I didn't over react to a idiot being a idiot. Is this normal? Will it end

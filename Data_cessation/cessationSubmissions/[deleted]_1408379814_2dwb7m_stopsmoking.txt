How do you avoid using food as a substitute for smoking?

I have heard some people start to eat more after they have quit smoking. I want to avoid doing this as my eating habits are fine as is. Any tips on staying away from the refrigerator? Toothpicks or something? What do you use to help with this, if at all?

Smoking as self harm

Have any other smokers/successfully transitioned non-smokers found it more difficult to quit because you see cigarettes as a form of self harm? I'm curious what worked best for you when quitting/trying to quit. I don't want to just latch onto a substitute "safer" form of self destruction. I want to be done with my safe zone being a state of self sabotage. I understand I have to work through a process requiring professional help, but in the meantime, I am so ready to let these cigarettes go. I feel constantly fatigued, anxious, unhealthy and old at 23 because of them. 

I would love to hear from those who have experienced a similar struggle, what worked for you. Thank you!

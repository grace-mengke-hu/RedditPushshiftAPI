Suffering the consequences- DONT PICK UP THAT STICK

I had quit for four months and then last weekend had went to a new and unfamiliar event where my new friends were smokers, so I ended up breaking my streak. 
I ended up buying two packs in addition to the cigarettes I bummed with others.. but promised to quit again after the week of vacation was over.. 
well, my throat was burned pretty bad and I’ve been hacking up disgusting and copious amounts of phlegm in the past four and a half days of quitting again. It’s reminding me of how awful smoking is. 
Thoughts of throat cancer are pretty persistent for me now. 
Anyway, I just felt like sharing this. It’s my first post here. I’m more of a social/binge smoker that can quit for a long time at random but once I get some triggers.. well , I fall for it. 
I’m hoping having some vague accountability will be helpful. I really want to make it to 5 months at least but we’ll see. 
I’m worried since I’ll see these smoker friends again in a few months. 
Any tips for me from fellow social smokers?

about to throw a hissy fit

Please anybody, it's been five weeks now and every now and then I'm having a day. A day where I'm experiancing extreme moodswings and could kill everybody! When does this stop? Or any advice, anything! 

EDIT: Haha, just threw a fit because the wind was blowing to hard on my way to work. Tough life over here! :)

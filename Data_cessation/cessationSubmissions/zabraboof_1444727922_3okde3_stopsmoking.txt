Is there something else in cigarettes that I could be addicted to?

I've been battling this for about 15 years now. I've not gone more than 3 days without nicotine since I started and not more than 2 weeks without a cigarette. I smoke heavily, about a pack a day. If I'm addicted to the nicotine, why doesn't nicotine replacement therapy seem to stave off cravings for cigarettes? Nicotine vaporizers don't seem to help as much either. There's something about a cigarette that numbs my brain in a way that instantly relieves a certain type of highly anxious feeling for me. I've tried various dosages of patches and gum. On the high-end (around 15mg patches), I become extremely tense and irritable. The low end (around 3mg patches) doesn't seem to have much of an effect. I've been consumed with this problem for most of my life and it's embarrassing that I still haven't fixed the problem. I've read Carr's Easy Way but it doesn't sync with me the way it does for people I've read about who have successfully quit after reading it. I've desperately wanted to quit for years and carry around a lot of guilt about it. I started smoking in high school to relieve anxiety and I'm certain there's an underlying condition (one which Adderall/dextro-morphine seems to soothe perfectly, though I don't take either and haven't except a handful of times). Posting this here hoping someone can relate to it. I'm not optimistic that I can ever quit after so many failures until I understand what's happening and can adapt to it in a healthier way.

Any advice is deeply appreciated.

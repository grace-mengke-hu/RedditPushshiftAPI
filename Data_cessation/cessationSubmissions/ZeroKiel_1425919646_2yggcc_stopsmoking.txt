12 hours without a cigarette, a question about Lozenges.

So I decided now's the time to quit. I'm taking 4mg lozenges, they suggest taking 9 a day. But it's been taking about an hour and a half to 2 hours for them to dissolve. That sounds ridiculous. Does anyone have any advice or suggestions with Lozenges?

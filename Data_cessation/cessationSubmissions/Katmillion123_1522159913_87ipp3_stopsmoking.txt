I fucking hate cigarettes so much

As the title says, I hate them, but I also hate that I love them and especially because I can't figure out WHY I love them so much. Is it the bad breath, the coughing and wheezing, the glorious phlegm that gets expelled in the morning, or the fact that I stink like shit everywhere I go? I started smoking when I was 13 to piss off my mom, needless to say it worked. I got suspended from school, grounded for a month and had to go to counseling sessions with our church bishop for almost half a year haha. But now my dear mother has been dead for 10 years so I don't think she cares anymore and I'm still changed to these stupid little things like my life depends on them. I've tried to quit smoking almost everyway that there is, cutting down, cold turkey (tried at all different hours of the day to set my quit goal hoping it would work) tried vaping, I can't stand it, the gum is gross, patches don't do shit, I successfully quit with chantix for a whole year once but was very disappointed in myself at how easy it was to just fall back into old habits. I'm currently 15 hours without a cigarette, I've gone between 10-24 hours several times in the last couple of months but always break. Any advice from anyone on how too make this any easier? Does it really get much better after the first three days (because I'm willing to lock myself in my room for a long weekend if I'll come out not wanting to choke everybody) I've smoked for 20 years now, a pack or more a day. Quit both times I was pregnant (easily picked it back up again as soon as I could) and quit for a year with chantix. I'm currently on a health kick at home (diet and exercise for all!) And I really want to kick these damn things out of my life. I want to have the energy to want to exercise and the lung capacity to be able to handle cardio workouts. Anybody with encouraging words or advice is welcome here please ðŸ˜•

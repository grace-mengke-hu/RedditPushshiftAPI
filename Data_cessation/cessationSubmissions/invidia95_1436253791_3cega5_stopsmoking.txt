is easyway really that good?

hi, so this is my second time trying to quit (last time i lasted about a month and a half). Anyway, thanks to everybody who is active on this subreddit, it has been an amazing source of motivation and probably kept me from relapsing a few times tbh. Now to get to the point i was trying to make. From what i've seen around most of u have nothing but good things to say about allen carr and his books, materials etc. I've read the book and i find everything incredibly cheap. what i mean is that most of the book is like pulled out of a bad motivational video. now i dont mean to belittle it. if it helped at least one person it's worth it. anyway i guess i just want to know if there is anybody who shares my opinion.

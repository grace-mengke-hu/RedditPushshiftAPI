How to stay motivated after month(s)?

Hey all, my first reddit post here and sorry for my bad english (german native).

It's my second attempt and I'm now at day 47. Actually, I'm surprised about how easy it gets after 3 weeks to not light up. However, all the stop-smoking timelines (in apps etc.) focus on the first weeks as a lot of improvements happen quite fast.

Now I got all achievements that are quickly to reach, the next that will happen is improved oxygen uptake within the next 6 weeks.

Of course I know that my whole body is healing on its own and not by rules of any app â€“ but I'd like to know if some of you have tips or ideas how to stay motivated if you've succeeded the hardest first weeks?

Thank you!

Stopping smoking :)

22 year old been smoking ~5 a day for 3 years. Finally decided to stop by buying a supermarket vape (Blu) and haven’t had the urge to smoke since. Feel so much healthier already. It’s probably placebo, but I enjoy not having to spray myself with deodorant when coming back into the house or going somewhere and not constantly having to chew gum, since I’d go through around 7 gums a day. 

Gl everyone else, glad to hear that you’re quitting.

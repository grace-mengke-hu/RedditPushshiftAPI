Day 9 - Focus

I'm stronger than cravings.

I'm 100% focused on my goal.

I'll live long for my kids.

I'll invest all the money i have wasted in giving a better life to me and my family.

I remember why

I'll never forgot why i have stoped.

I'll never waste my family's future in my own disgrace.

I'm 100% focused. You should be too.

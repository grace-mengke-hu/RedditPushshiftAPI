Nearly 36 hours strong

Hi gals and guys, its been nearly 36 hours now and althought I still have cravings and am a bit edgy, I managed to hold my end up to now. Like mentionned in one of my post, quitting is at the same time one of the simplest thing to do and one of the hardest. All you need to do is not do something but you could nearly kill to do that thing. 

I find it hard but not as deadful as I was imaginating it. I try to distract myself by studying. I am 40 and I decided it was time to complete my bachelor's degree. Working 40 hours a week and subscribed to 4 courses this upcoming semester. Will probably want to kick me in the nuts for taking so many classes but we'll see. 

Wish me well while I keep battling against my addiction.

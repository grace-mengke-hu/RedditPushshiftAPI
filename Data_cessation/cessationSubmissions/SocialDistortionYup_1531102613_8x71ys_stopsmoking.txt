Smoking and depression

I want to quit but I'm so nervous about having depressive episodes and not having anything to run to. I think that when I started smoking 10 years ago it re-wired my brain in a way that made me more depressed, but now I need the nicotine to help me through depressive episodes. Its a vicious cycle!

Anyone have experience? I know this is partly my addiction talking but I so desperately want to quit!

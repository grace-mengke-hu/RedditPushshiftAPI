Didn’t think about a cigarette the whole work shift!

When I’m at work I used to smoke once every 1-2 hours without fail. If I wasn’t busy I’d even be checking my watch half an hour after a ciggie waiting until it’s acceptable for me to go smash another one. It’s only been about 9 days since my last ciggie but I went the whole day without even thinking about one. Didn’t even cross my mind. I’m pretty happy with that because it used to take up a fair bit of my thought process.

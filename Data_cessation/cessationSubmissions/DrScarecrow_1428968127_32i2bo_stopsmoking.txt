12 days in- need advice

My last cigarette was on April 1, 4 a.m. I'm 24, and I started smoking when I was 14, up to more than a pack a day for most of the last five years or so. I loved chain smoking, it was pretty much my hobby. 
This isn't my first attempt to quit but I'm determined to make it my last. I'm having a hard time though. I see everyone saying that the cravings are only a few minutes, they will pass, but I'm getting cravings and urges that last far longer than that, and after they're gone, I get another one within twenty minutes. They won't go away and they're not getting easier to handle. I got through this far on pure determination, but I'm running out of motivation. 
I'm quitting with my boyfriend (using a vape), and he's been a great help. I just don't understand why this is such hell. Am I doing something wrong? Is there anyone out there who had a similar experience? Please help, any advice is appreciated.

I got a wave of nostalgia that makes me want to smoke

My job brought in chick fil a for a baby shower this morning, which I hadn't had since college. In college, I would eat there all the time with my friends while smoking. 

I was remembering eating nuggets and fries, drinking some soda, lighting one cigarette off another. Shooting the shit with my best friends and chain smoking. I got the strongest craving and dipped out of the party before I bumbed one. 

It's been like 30 min and it's getting better, but it's still hard. Some of my coworkers walked past on their way out to smoke laughing and joking with each other, just like college. 

I just wanted to share this with you guys.

I made it past a year... I didn't even realise.

I just read a friend's post on facebook saying how he hadn't smoked in a year. That made me wonder how long it had been for me. Turns out I haven't been a smoker in 424 days now!

To everyone just starting out: It gets easier, it really does. At some point you won't even remember that you were a smoker. Keep it up!

Not yet an ex-smoker

So I'm at 20 days. Overall it's going OK. I have to watch out though. There are moments when I feel sorry for myself. I'm in agony when I move since Friday when I busted my back. My addict brain tries to convince me that a cigarette would be some form of compensation/reward for my pain. In the past posting here has helped. I am not going to smoke today.

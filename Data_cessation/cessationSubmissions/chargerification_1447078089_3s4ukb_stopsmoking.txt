Re-quitting

Had a few months clean at one point and had a decent relapse into cigarettes because of some shitty corcumstances. The badge isn't accurate and I'd like it reset it to two days seeing that my last cigarettes was 11/1/15. It felt so good having 3 months off smoking but now I'm back to spitting out phlegm and feel nasty. Here we go again, sincerely hoping it sticks this time.

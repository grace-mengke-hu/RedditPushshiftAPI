Sharp pains on my right side, have any of you experienced something similar?

It's now 167 days for me without a smoke, but a few days ago I suddenly started feeling this odd sharp pain in the upper right of my body. I can only feel it when I take in a deep breath, at that point when my lungs are completely full of air is when I feel it, and it goes away right after. It feels like maybe my lungs are getter bigger, or something, I'm not sure.

I'm going to the doctor on Thursday just to be safe, but I figured I'd ask here anyways have any of you experienced something similar around this many smoke-free days?

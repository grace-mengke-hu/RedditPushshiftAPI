Quit by accident a few days ago but I'm sticking to it now!

So I'm having a few issues with anxiety at the moment to the point where I can't leave the house. Which means that I haven't been able to buy cigarettes. Normally the thought of nicotine pushes me to go out but I'm so tired right now it hasn't happened. And I've realised something, I don't actually need it.

I know it's the early stages but I don't want a cigarette. They make me feel like shit and I hate the smell. I hate the taste in my mouth afterwards and how paranoid they make me. I hate how much I worry about my health and how dependant I am on them. I can sense some withdrawal symptoms now. It feels like there's an odd pressure on my throat and I'm starting to shake. To be honest I've not felt this bad in a long time but I'm determined. The biggest issue is going to be around other people smoking now. All my work colleagues do and I find it helps me be less awkward. But this is it now. I've had enough.

Two weeks in and I feel awesome!

I had some bad cravings, but they've subsided now and I don't think about it too often, except when I'm with people who are smoking (which is often - everyone in this country smokes).  But still I've been relaxed and haven't had too many problems.  To those going through your first couple days - stick with it!  Before no time, your sense of smell will return, your gums will stop bleeding when you floss, you'll be able to walk up stairs, go swimming, and do yoga and feel GOOD!  I can't believe just a few weeks ago I would light up right after working out.  I feel so much better now.

I've been non-smoker for one month and just bought a pack.

I smoked half of it and then I realized how stupid I was and I don't need to start this shit again. Just crushed the pack with the other half of cigarettes. I'm not willing to lose the control of my body to nicotine again. It's me who tells my body what to inhale and that is the fresh air without any of those 4000 filthy chemicals. 

Stay strong brothers and sisters. You can do it!

A silly reason to be proud..

But today is my first dentist appointment post quit and I can't help but feel a sense of pride knowing that,  although slowly,  the condition of my teeth and gums are improving and the dentist is able to tell.  Not to mention I smell exponentially better and my breath isn't comparable to an ashtray.  
I never realized how vain I was until I quit smoking. Haha.

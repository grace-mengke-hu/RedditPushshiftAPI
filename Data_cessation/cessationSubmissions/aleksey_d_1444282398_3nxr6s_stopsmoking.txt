I've smoked first 3 cigs. in my life. Am I doomed?

Stupid me, decided to test my luck. 

Tried the first one - spit it out. Though the second and the third unfortunately turned out to be fine.

 I sweared that I will never taste it again, but today I found myself in need to buy a pack! 

Help me please, what should I do? I'm in panic right now. And these were only 3 cigs!

Is my addiction already developed? I'm scared like hell.

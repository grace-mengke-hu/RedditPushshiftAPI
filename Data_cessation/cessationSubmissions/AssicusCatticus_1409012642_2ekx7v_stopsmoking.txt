90 Days and Still Going Strong!

If I can do 90 days, anyone can!  I started smoking at 11 years old and am nearly 39, but dammit, I quit!  I'm done poisoning myself and if you're sitting on the fence about quitting, I hope you see this and it makes you say, "I can do it, too!"  Because, believe me, you can!

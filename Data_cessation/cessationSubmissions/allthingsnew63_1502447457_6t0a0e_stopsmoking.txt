Haven't slept in 10 days!

For the last 10 days, I wake up every1.5-2 hours.  I can't get up on time for work because I keep falling back asleep.  When I get home, I start falling asleep in my chair almost immediately because I'm so tired,  I stepped down on my patch strength a week ago and a few days before that I started taking them off early each day (I haven't worn them to sleep).  

Has anyone experienced this?  Any ideas?  Suggestions?  I can't keep this up, but let me be clear: I will never smoke again!!

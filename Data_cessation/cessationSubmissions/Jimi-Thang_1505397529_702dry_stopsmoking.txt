2 months!!! If I can do it, anyone can.

I am at around 2 months without a cigarette. I tried quitting countless times and failed just as many, but this time I knew was different. It was the hardest thing I have ever done, but it was also so simple. "Just don't smoke!" is such a simple task, but as many here will agree, it is not easy. It does get easier as time passes. After those first 2 weeks of white knuckled determination, I stopped constantly thinking about cigarettes. Never let yourself become complacent though. Nicotine is a strong addiction to break and can/will sneak up on you if you let it! To anyone considering stopping, quit now! And, if you fail, just keep trying. Eventually, it will work!

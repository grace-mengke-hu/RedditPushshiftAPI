I screwed up, question time.

I quit for about two months starting in july and had the works for bad withdrawals. The anxiety is still here, but it WAS getting less noticeable and better for day to day things. But i screwed up and about two weeks ago I was drinking  and had a lot of cigarettes. I was wondering if this was enough to create a relapse of withdrawal symptoms?

2 weeks cold turkey and sleeping trouble?

So it's my 14th day without a cigarette and I find that I wake up several times a night now. I dont have trouble going back to sleep, and I feel well rested by the time I actually do get up, but I wake up about 5-6 times a night. Not only do I wake up but once I do wake up the first time, I have vivid dreams from there on out every time I fall back asleep. Anyone else share this same experience? On a positive note, im doing very well with not smoking after years of smoking. Good luck and stay strong my friends!

Is this normal?

Decided to quit smoking last week after ~10 years.  I was never a *super* heavy smoker, but usually averaged about a pack every 2 days, more on the weekends.

I had been thinking about quitting for some time, the problem being I really *enjoy* smoking as a habit.  However I'm not an idiot, I knew I would have to give it up at some point, and last week after a minor fight with my wife I spontaneously threw all my cigs out and declared I was done.

So its been 10+ days.  I *have* smoked a few cigs while drinking this past weekend and the weekend before.  I have an e-cig which I've been using a bit.  But honestly, I have not really had any problem stopping.  I haven't really experienced the kind of physical cravings others are describing.  I have continued doing everything I normally do and not smoking has been far more easy than I was expecting.

Is this normal?  I mean I drunkenly bummed a few cigs, but didn't experience any kind of "oh god I need to buy a pack!"  I just smoked them and that was that.  I haven't even really used my e-cig.  I was expecting physical withdrawal symptoms, mood swings, intense cravings..... I was geared up for a serious mental battle but it just feels more like a minor inconvenience.

As I said its been around 10 days... is the worst yet to come or something?  I am bit confused (in a good way of course).  From what I've read and been told by friends and family I was expecting a serious period of withdrawal.  Instead I just haven't really thought about it much, and before I know it another day has gone by where I haven't smoked.

Am I just lucky?  Or have others experienced anything similar?

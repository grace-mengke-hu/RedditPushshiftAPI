Quitting is awesome!

Hello everyone! I have not been on this thread for quite some time, but felt the need to share my story in hopes it could help some one like so many of the posts on this thread helped me. I smoked my last cigarette on March 27, 2016. I had been a smoker for  13 years, but finally got to the point where I was over it. I believe I was able to successfully quit by facing my cravings head on and treating them like symptoms of nicotine withdrawal, and not blame myself for being weak. It really is the nicotine trying to trick your brain into getting more nicotine. Just don't give the nicotine what it wants and it gets better/a little easier every day to just not have a cigarette. Don't give up! I never truly realized how much I would gain by quitting smoking... My husband and I had been trying to have a baby for 4 years. I found out I was pregnant in June 2016 and am so thankful I did not have the added stress of having to quit smoking in those early weeks of pregnancy. I also believe that I would never have gotten pregnant had I still been smoking! Don't give up guys, just demonize the cigarettes and believe your inner soul that wants to quit. Don't listen to the nicotine! Much love.

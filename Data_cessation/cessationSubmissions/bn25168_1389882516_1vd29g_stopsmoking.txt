Does anyone know of any good no-nicotine E cigarettes?

Im trying to find a good no-nicotine E cig to help with my non stop cue induced cravings so I can engage in the "act of smoking" without actually smoking anything or pumping any more nicotine into my system. 

 I'm not interested in vapors or those weird looking things that look like crack pipes from the future. Just the e cig design that shaped like a cigarette. If anyone knows of a product I would greatly appreciate the help in locating one.

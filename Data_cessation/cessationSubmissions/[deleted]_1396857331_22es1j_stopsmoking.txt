I just fucking wasted nearly 5 years of being smoke-free

JUST had my first cigarette since my 21st birthday. It was my gift to myself, to start living healthier, and I FUCKING DID IT ON THE FIRST TRY. Cold turkey, didn't take another single fucking hit since I made the decision. Real fucking impressive, right? Welp, that's all down the shitter now.

I know this isn't /r/offmychest, but I just made a post there (actually related to why I did this stupid shit), and I figured people here would relate better, anyway. Actually, I don't even know if this is the right place for this sort of thing. First semi-relevant subreddit I found, though. Sorry if this doesn't belong here.

This shit is gross. Why did I even do it? I have a whole pack here, too, and the worst part is I am considering lighting another.

Fuck me.

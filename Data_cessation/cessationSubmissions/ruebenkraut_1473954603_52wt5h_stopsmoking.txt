Sick and tired of this shit...

I've wasted sooo much money on this cancerous crap over the last 13 years of my life. This month even more than usual because i already tried to quit multiple times and kept buying and throwing away new packs.

I'm done. Not having it anymore. Just threw away another pack, and this. Is. It.
Quite frustrated with myself, as you can see.

Do you guys have any tips on how to stay sane the next few days? What worked for you? I can't afford a relapse, financially as well as mentally.

Any help is very much appreciated!

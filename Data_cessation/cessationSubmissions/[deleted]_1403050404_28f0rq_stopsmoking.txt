There's a chance I will quit tomorrow. Advice?

I'm 19 years old male, I started smoking actively in 2010. when my brother killed himself. It was the hardest and most depressing time in my life. I'm "over" that, it was a long-ish time ago so don't feel sorry for me.

I just want you to tell me the benefits of quitting. Some are obvious, I know, but still if you feel like it, write something.

I can't, for example, imagine drinking coffee and not smoking.I drink Turkish coffee (I'm from Serbia) and I just love the flavor of it but it wouldn't be as good as with a cigarette to add the flavor, at least I think so.

Also I like to listen to music and daydream and I can't imagine doing that without a cigarette.

When I work or something, I'm fine. It's in my personal time that I smoke the most. So if any of you had similar situation, feel free to comment.

I realize I sound like a little girl but I don't know how else I could put it.

Also if I am truly going to quit, I'm quitting cold turkey.

The problem is I know that cigarettes are bad for me, I knew that all this time but I didn't want to quit. Getting myself to actually wanting to quit will do the job.

So cigarettes are starting to piss me off sometimes. Difficulty  breathing, obviously. The tobacco flavor is gone. Now it's just this thing in my life that I keep doing and it's getting annoying. I'm getting sick of them all of a sudden. So what's up with that?

I'm gonna go to sleep now and when I wake up I will eat, make coffee, sit in my room and read the comments.

Not promising anything but I will really think about it, with or without your advice. I just thought it'll be fun this way. :)

Thank you for reading.

Regards.

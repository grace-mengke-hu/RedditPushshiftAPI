Need advice on overcoming the anxiety from quitting

I've been trying to quit for some time now. Just thinking about quitting causes me to start having anxiety attacks. Most specifically I have the hardest time not smoking at work. At home I can deal with it a lot easier. While on vacation in Portland I was able to quit cold turkey no problems. Being back here, I just feel a sense of stress and anxiety when I think about NOT picking up a cigarette. I hopefully had my last one this morning, and I put a patch on (only had a 7mg available), but I feel very anxious right now and I keep thinking "it's not so bad if I just have one more, right?". Sorry to ramble, this is stressful. Any advice on relieving this anxiety?? I have severe ADD and meditation just... doesn't work lol

Thank you

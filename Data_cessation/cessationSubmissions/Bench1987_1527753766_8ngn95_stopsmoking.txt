Finally a week smoke free!

I’ve finally hit the 7 day mark on the smoke free app. I’ve been smoking for nearly 20 years, 30ish smokes a day.

Tried quitting many times before. I have 4 children and another due end of the year. I have no idea what made me want to quit this time, more of a ‘enough is enough’ I think. However I always end up smoking again within a day.

I read somewhere else that candy crush was a good thing to keep your mind active whilst wanting a craving, so thought fuck it I’ll give it a go, and it’s worked! That and a lot of fighting myself in my mind and literally screaming to myself in my head...NO!

It’s been really tough this week and I’m sure it’ll get tougher, just thought I’d share with fellow quitters, to keep myself and will power and morale boosted.

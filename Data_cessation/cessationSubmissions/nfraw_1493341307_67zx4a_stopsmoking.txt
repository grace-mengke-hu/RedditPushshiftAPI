How to tell my dad not to start smoking again?

Last September my dad had a mini stroke and his doctor told him he needed to quit smoking. He was using the patches and was doing good but sometimes he would smoke maybe once or twice every couple weeks. Now he's still on the patches but I think he's starting to smoke again like 2-3 times a day that I know of. How can I tell him he needs to stop and not start smoking again? Should I let my mom know so she can talk to him?

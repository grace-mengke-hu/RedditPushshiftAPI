I goofed guys. Damnit.

So last night marked 11 days without smoking. Well, needless to say, time to reset thee counter. I got a little tipsy last night, and through my weakened inhibitions and judgement, Ibummed a smoke from my SO. BUT, the thing is, I took 3 puffs..and it was absolutely horrible tasting, disgusting. I thought, 'why the hell did I want this?' It wasn't rewarding at all, and I'm still trying to figure out why I even took it in the first place. Cigarettes don't even have anything going for them, and I smelled like ash for the rest of the night. Lesson learned: I'm NOT MISSING OUT ON A  DAMN THING. Fuck cigs. Fuck nicotine. Time to start over, with this new knowledge.

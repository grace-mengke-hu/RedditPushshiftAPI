I had a dream last night that I gave in to cravings and quit my quit.

Woke up today happy that it was a bad dream, and I indeed had not sabotaged my progress.

Almost 9 months down, just three to go until I hit a full year! My last failure was at the 9 month mark, so this will be a huge milestone for me to pass.

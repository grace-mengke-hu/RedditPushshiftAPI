Ok. I wanna quit smoking... What's your best advice?

Smoking for 16 years. Up to a pack a day now. 

Quit 26 hours ago, cold turkey, and found it actually fairly easy. Having some strong urges now though. I came so close to smoking one a minute ago, realized I may need some help, so now Im here. 

What's the best tools available? What helped you the most in kicking this filthy habit?



Please, Enlighten me...

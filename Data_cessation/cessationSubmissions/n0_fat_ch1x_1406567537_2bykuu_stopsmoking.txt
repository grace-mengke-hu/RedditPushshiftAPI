Quit for 1 year exactly...

8 months ago i started smoking again. It's worse than before. mostly because i can drink legally now. I've tried so many times these past months to quit but i cant. Tried gum (worked for that year) didn't work. I tried E-Cigs, didnt work. I even tried cold turkey. none of it worked because i always bum some off people when im drunk, and i wake up the next day craving it all over from the start again. So that is why i am here. I have never tried to use a support group for this problem before but i realize it is my only option now. Here is to day one. To all you others with me on this first wretched day, I wish you luck and im here with you. To all of you that continue to refuse to do it, please give some advice. I, and im sure many others, would like all and any advice you have. I have been looking over this sub and I like it. 
However the main reason i am posting. I would like to ask all the others that have a hard time resisting a smoke when drinking. no matter how strong my willpower is when i am sober, it seems i always give in when drunk. do any of you have any advice on how to resist while drinking? What was it you did to get over that?

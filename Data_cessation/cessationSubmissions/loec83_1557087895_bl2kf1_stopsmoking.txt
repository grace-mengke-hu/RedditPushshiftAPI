Just had my last cigarette

Well the time has come, Iâ€™ve got my patches and spray ready for the morning, this will be my 10th attempt at quitting. I have smoked 20 a day for as long as I can remember, Has anybody got any tips to help me kick this habit for good this time? All help will be greatly received

Extreme anger 50 days after quitting

So i was wondering if anyone else ever experienced this intense anger even after 50 days of quitting.

My girlfriend told me that i'm very quick to get angry and i'm tense most of the time and i was wondering if this is still normal after these many days?

I'd like to add that this is my 2nd time quitting ( smoked for 8 years , quit 2 years ,  then smoked for 3 more years , now i quit) .

I've been dealing wiht some other things like anxiety and some health issues like constant colds and stuff for a while aswell. Is this normal?

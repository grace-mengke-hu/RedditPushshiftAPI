I need to restart my badge but I really don't want to...

As of this morning I was 94 days of non-smoking.  Quit January 2.  January 1 at 10pm to be exact, but at this point doesn't really matter.  The past 6 weeks have been very tough.  Couple of very hard things to deal with.  But yet I managed to not smoke.  I was proud of that.  I could actually beat this smoking thing.  Last night I had to bring my bestie to the vet.  Not good news.  I knew that when I brought him to the vet I would not be leaving with him.  I had to put him down today.  My Zeek should have been around for another 8-10 years.  But as life would have it, today was the day he needed to go.  That is something I was not (am still not) ready for. So I smoked. Cause that's what I do.  Have been all day.  It's gross and know I will not do it tomorrow.  But today, I'm ok with it.  I'll allow myself that.  I'm disappointed in myself for that, but know that tomorrow I'll be back to a non-smoker.  I'm going to take this as my mulligan, my hiccup, and as much as I probably *should* restart my badge, I don't think I'm going to.  Everybody (almost) messes up sometimes right?

Body temperature?

Greetings from Houston, Texas. Haven't had a cigarette in however many days-- will be three weeks this Wednesday

In the last couple weeks have found that I am most comfortable in my house when it is like 82 degrees. Totally weird. I am a chubby man, not the kind who sleeps with socks on.

My electricity bill loves it, but anyone else experiencing changes in temperature or AC preferences

Thank you

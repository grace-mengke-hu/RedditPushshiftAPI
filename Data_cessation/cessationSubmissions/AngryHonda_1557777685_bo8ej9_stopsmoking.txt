1 year smoke free

Today is my one year anniversary of quitting smoking. I had tried so many times before but this time seems to be sticking. 

It was so hard the first 3 months and it took all my willpower to not buy cigarettes.  Luckily I am lazy and my laziness helped me from running to the store and going out and buying them.

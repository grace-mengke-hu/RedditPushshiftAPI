Should've never picked up the Juul... (help)

I'll keep this short guys. 23M I've been juuling every single day for the past 1-2 months. I go through 2 (3%) pods a day. I tried throwing the juul away and I just go back and buy more. Tonight I put my wallet in my Moms car as she goes to work all day and doesnt come back home until night so I basically have no way to buy a Juul. I threw it away and now am ready for withdrawals... Couple of questions:

&amp;#x200B;

\- How long do withdrawals last?

\- What should I do while going through it?

\- By what time frame generally do you not crave nicotine anymore and feel normal?

&amp;#x200B;

Might be dumb questions but I'm just trying to find answers. Thank you everyone good luck

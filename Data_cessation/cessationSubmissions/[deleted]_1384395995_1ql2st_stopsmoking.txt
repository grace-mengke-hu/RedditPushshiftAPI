Advice for quitting

Hey everyone! Im sure this is a repost but I figured maybe you all could help me with ways to help myself quit smoking.  I currently smoke half a pack or a pack a day and while I enjoy smoking....I know its bad and that I shoukd stop.  And it's fucking expensive.   Any and all advice/help will be greatly appreciated!!! I was thinking about how much I want to quit today and I stumbled across this subreddit and I think it's meant to be.  Looking at how long you all have been smoke free is inspirational and I'd love to hear details of how you did it!!!

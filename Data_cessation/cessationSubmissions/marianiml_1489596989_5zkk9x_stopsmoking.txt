Wine and Cigarettes--oh how I miss them :)

So,  it seemed prudent to give up alcohol during my quit.  I thought I would miss it more, but I think I miss the idea more than the wine or smokes.  I just wonder how long it will be before I can safely have a glass of wine, and enjoy it without the accompanying cigarette.   As an informal survey,  I'd like to know how long people waited before trying a drink?   I guess the upside is that I really don't need the calories right now,  and I am waking up every day feeling pretty good--but I miss the feeling of being a little less inhibited --

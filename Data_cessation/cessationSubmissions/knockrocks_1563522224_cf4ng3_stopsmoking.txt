OKAY. I’m on hour 2, lol.

I don’t wanna run through my story, really. But here’s what I know: 

I’ve successfully quit for an entire year before, a few years back. So I know I CAN do it.

I know that after a few weeks, the jittery, restless compulsion to smoke is nearly gone. 

I know that it saves me fuckloads of money. 

I know whenever I cut out the smoking, I magically stop snoring. 

I know that I daily fear the damage I am doing to myself. 

I know that at this point, I smoke out of addictive necessity, half the time, not from pleasure or enjoyment.

I know that smoking/vaping gives me massive headaches and stomach upset due to the excessive nicotine flooding my body. 

I know that puffing away on that stupid vape all day is a compulsive, never-ending action. 

I know that my entire day is shaped around when I can get my next fix. I look like some kind of fucked up crackhead choo-choo train, with this constant billowing cloud surrounding me. I take twice the amount of time I should on lunch cuz MORE NICOTINE. 

I know that I’m just so tired of this whole lifestyle. I need to quit and I need to do it forever.

I didnt buy cigarettes this weekend.

My current take on quitting is the goal of not buying a pack of cigarettes ever again. I made it through the weekend, drinking and all. And, yes.. I was tempted. But, I did not buy a pack of cigarettes. 

I did have to bum one, but.. still, this is progress. I realize vaping and cheating here and there is the opposite of quitting, but.. Ive saved over $90 since June 1. And smoked 3 cigarettes all week instead of 20 per day?

I feel like there is a light at the end of the tunnel and that I can actually do this this time. It may take a lot longer than it 'should', but... I dont care about the journey I take to get to quit; I just need to get there. For the first time in a long time, I am hopeful that I will.

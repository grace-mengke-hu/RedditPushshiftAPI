I'm not so great at asking for help, but here goes nothing!

my story is the same clich√© smoker story we've all heard. I've tried time and time again to quit, only to get a few days in (even a week or two at times) and then I let the symptoms and my temper get the best of me. I promised my boyfriend I would quit if/when we moved in together (partially because smoking is expensive, but mostly due to his asthma and my future health), and now I don't know where to start. I want so badly to be successful, but I don't want quitting and all the emotions that go along with it to put a damper on my already slightly crazy life. help me, reddit! any tips on how to ease symptoms? or any alternatives? where do I even begin?

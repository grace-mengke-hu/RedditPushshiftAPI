I want to quit but I’m so scared.

I know I can do it, but the other part of me thinks I can’t. Logically, I should be able to, just don’t do it right? 

Yet I have such an addictive personality and other issues that I use as a crutch to feed my addiction.

“I’ll gain weight and I’m a recovering anorexic”

“I’m stressed out I don’t want to be irritable”

“I don’t want to be the odd one out with my friends”

“It makes me feel so good”

It doesn’t though. It doesn’t make me feel good. Watching my savings get smaller and smaller due to my addiction SUCKS. Feeling like shit all the time SUCKS. Being teased (light heartedly) or getting stares from people SUCKS. Having to hide it SUCKS. I’m tired of the sucking part.

I had no plans on quitting until about half an hour from now. 

I’m 18. I’ve been addicted to nicotine since I was 13. I think it’s time.

27 hours and I think I can do this!

It's been 27 hours since my last slip up....but for some reason, I'm not feeling as many withdrawal symptoms as I was yesterday. I think I can do this now. Only effect I'm feeling is slight grogginess. What should I expect to feel/see tommorow? Or this first week of quitting? 
When will the symptoms peak and when will most of them go away?

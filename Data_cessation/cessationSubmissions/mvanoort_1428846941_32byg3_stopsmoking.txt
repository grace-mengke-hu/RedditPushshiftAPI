Made it through the first 3 days!

I decided to stop smoking on Thursday, using the Allen Carr method. I had my last smoke on Thursday morning at 10:00, so it's officially been 72 hours. To be honest, the first 2 days were fine. Yesterday was pretty shitty, but I made it through, and I hear it gets easier from here on in. Thanks for the encouragement, fellow Redditors!

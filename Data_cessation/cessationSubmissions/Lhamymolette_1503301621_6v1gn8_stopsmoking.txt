Not even one day

But I stopped 15h ago. My wife is pregnent and we choose to stop together.
I was unable to stop this weekend with people around me smoking (I have the willpower of a cooked oyster).

So I really hope that not smoking during the week will be easier and that being 5 days free will help me. So here is the stone that marked my (I hope) first day without smoke!

So, I'm nervous as hell and have very little faith in myself....

So I'm 24 years old, have been smoking since 19 and quit for a year and a half but "relapsed" about 2 years ago. During the time I did quit, I was still addicted to nicotine lozanges and had one in my mouth 24/7.

Coming Christmas, I'm  planning on quitting for the THOUSANDTH time. I'm reading the "easy way to quit smoking" for the third time right now. It really had helped my cravings and I'll go 2-4 days every now and then. Im planning on not having any nicotine replacements whatsoever-I just want this addiction gone completely. I'm tired of thinking about it. I'm just stubborn-I want my stubbornness to be switched the other way around though with not touching a cigarette. I don't necessarily crave them I've just been in this routine for awhile.

I have so much self doubt that I think it's my biggest hindrance in being successful. I've quit so many times and I've talked about quitting so much but I never follow through. Any advice? 

I'm so excited about this subreddit too! I feel so hopeless with this love/hate relationship I have with cigarettes. What better way to get advice than from those who have quit themselves?

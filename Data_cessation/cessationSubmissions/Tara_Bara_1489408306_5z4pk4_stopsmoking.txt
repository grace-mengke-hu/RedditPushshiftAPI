Week 1...Done!

Today marks 7 full days without inhaling cancer sticks. To be honest, I'm still white-knuckling it a little bit. One of the things that's kept me smober is the thought of being isolated with cigarettes again. 

When I started smoking, it was because the crowd I hung around with all smoked. Fast forward 2 decades, and none of those people smoke anymore. Now it's just me and "Nic," and he's such a drag. At home, I can't smoke in the house, so I would always be confined to the garage...just burning my life away with Nic, no one else allowed. The thought of having to return to that garage is just pathetic and depressing enough to keep me on the straight and narrow.

Anyhoo, thanks for listening to my rants this past week. I'm feeling better today, but I'm sure there will be more rants to come. :)

Wife is having trouble quitting, and I want to suggest vaping. What's an e-cig that won't suck?

I've never been a smoker and have never vaped. What I really want to avoid is getting her one that isn't any good, and souring her on the whole idea of vaping. I know that she's going to be super frustrated just as a baseline while she's quitting, and if the e-cig brings its own frustrations then it's just not gonna work out.

So basically I think I'm looking for the iPhone of e-cigs. The one that's simple, doesn't demand a lot from the user, is made well, and works well. I expect to pay an iPhone-like price, and that's okay, as long as I get what I'm looking for.

Any advice and recommendations will be sincerely appreciated.

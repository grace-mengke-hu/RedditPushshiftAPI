Quitting this disgusting, nasty habit.

I know you guys get first day posts all the time...but I just have to share with somebody that I smoked my last cigarette tonight.  

I've been smoking for 4 and a half years.  4.5 years x 365 days a year x $8.50 a pack that is almost $14,000.  $14,000 fucking dollars.  That is like I took a nice car and lit it on fire.  That is completely idiotic considering I'm sitting here basically broke until next Friday when I get paid!

It isn't just the money.  It is how smoking so heavily has detrimentally affected my life.  My boss, a militant former smoker, looks down on me because of it.  Rather than do something in the evenings...I sit in front of the computer or TV chain smoking.  Slowly killing myself.  What a waste of time.  What a waste of my life.

Fuck those smelly, worthless, pieces of crap.  I'm done with it forever.  I threw out my lighters.  I have no cigarettes.  I made 5 notes.  A post it on my computer, a post it on my truck's dashboard, a post it on my work computer, a note in my wallet where i keep my debit card, and a post it where I keep my keys at home.  They all just have written on them $14,000.  

To the future.

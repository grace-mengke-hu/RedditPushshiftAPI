Mucinex to clean lungs?

Hi! I am starting day 4 (I know, super early in the process....) and my quitting happens to coincide with me having a cold. I have been taking Mucinex for my cold, and wondered if anyone has ever tried using Mucinex to speed up clearing out your lungs from cigarette smoke.  I have seen a few things in google searches, but was hoping for some first hand information!

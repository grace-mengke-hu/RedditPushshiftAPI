Aaaaahh! Any volunteers for a choking?

I'm not quite sure if it has been a week or a week and a day or whatever. The badge will show. 
This whole week has been a blur. 

The past 3 nights have been the worst though. 
I have been giving myself some leeway with my sleep schedule for the quit but for the past 3 nights I wanted to start getting back to an 8 am schedule at the very least. 
Well so much for that. 
I have been compensating my cravings with keeping busy, exercise and healthy food unless it was a regular meal. 
I haven't been this active in quite some time and overall I feel great and actually exhausted and satisfied. BUT I just can't sleep. I know all this from past experiences but this time around I get insanely frustrated, which makes things worse. 
And I don't want to go full circle because of the cravings at this stage of the quit... 

Maybe I just have to tough it out... 

I was fortunate enough to start my quit outside of work. The day after tomorrow I have to get back to it but luckily because it's the end of the month I won't have a full shift till Saturday. 

What to do? 
By now my initial frustration has passed. In about 50 minutes it'll be back ... 

I'm also afraid of my first day back at work. Considering a lot of people smoke and it is customer service. .. 
Not another puff, no matter what... 

P.S.: been a 20-25 a day smoker, never thought I'd make it this far, don't want to give up (ever again), just going out of my mind at times

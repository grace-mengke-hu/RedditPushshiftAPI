What method did you use to quit?

I've cut myself down now to about 5-10 a day from 20 a day, and I'm looking to get away from smoking altogether soon. I currently use an e-cig at home, but at work or when I'm out with friends, I still have the urge to smoke. How did you guys quit? Did you just cut down and eventually stop, was it just going cold turkey or did you use an e-cig like me? 
Just trying to see what is the best way to quit. 
And I know it's different for everyone, would like to know your opinions though.

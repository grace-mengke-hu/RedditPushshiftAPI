68 Days Tobacco/Nicotine Free, but still have "hunger" feeling. People with longer quit times, does it disappear eventually?

Like the title says, I have been tobacco free for 68 days. I used to dip and smoke and found out that the best way to stop would be to quit both cold turkey to purge my body of its addiction.  Nicotine addiction was described by Alan Carr as a feeling of hunger. Ever since I quit that craving hunger feeling hasn't fully gone away. It may have subsided a little bit but it's still there.  Anyone know if there's a time frame that it usually goes away?  Or is it just going to continue to very gradually get better until eventually it's gone? I don't plan on smoking or dipping even if the feeling stays. It would just be nice to be reassured that eventually it does pass.

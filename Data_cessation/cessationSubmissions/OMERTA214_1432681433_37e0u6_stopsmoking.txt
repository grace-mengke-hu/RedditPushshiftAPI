1 month down!

Last time I posted my progress here i was only at 1 week complete. Here I stand today 31 days clean of all smoke and nicotine. My cravings are few and far between, although they are more "passing thoughts" then cravings. I've been doing so well I actually missed my official 1 month by one day! Its been a great 31 days so far, and here's to another 31 and beyond.

I sincerely thank everyone in this sub for just being here. You guys gave me the strength and support I needed to push through. See you guys at 60 days.

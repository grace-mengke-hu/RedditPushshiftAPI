App for windows 10 (phone)

Hi people,

I quited two weeks ago. i had an App on my phone that counted the sigarettes i didn't smoke, the saved money etc. etc etc.
For me personal it was a kinda motivation to see what i would give up when i would smoke again. So does someone know a good APP for windows?

TLDR; I need an app that counts for me on Windows(phone).

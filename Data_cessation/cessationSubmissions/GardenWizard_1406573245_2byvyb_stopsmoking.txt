My day 1: what has helped you all quit for good.

My last cigarette was last night (July 27th) and I desperately need it to stay my last. Im 27 and have smoked for almost 10 years.I am so tired of being ashamed and disgusted because of this vice. I have a smokers cough and just generally feel sluggish. Im using a vape and plan to cut my nicotine level every week until I can do without. What has worked for everyone here that has helped you STAY quit. Congrats to all the people who have stopped, im looking forward to joining your ranks!

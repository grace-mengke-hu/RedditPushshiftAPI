Small victories

I started smoking in earnest during my freshman year of college. The year before, I had run the Chicago marathon. As college progressed, I spent more time smoking as I burned the midnight oil, and less time working out. Running fell away from my life, and my attempts at the occasional jog left my feeling winded and ashamed. 

Last night, on a whim, I laced up those same shoes I'd run the marathon in, and did a two mile lap around the neighborhood!

Two miles is nothing to write home about, but the fact that I ran for 20 minutes straight and felt INVIGORATED afterwards, instead of STRANGLED is huge for me.

Little by little our bodies are healing. Let's not muck it up. Join me in not smoking today!

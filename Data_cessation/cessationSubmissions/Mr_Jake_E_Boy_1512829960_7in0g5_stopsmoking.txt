Adhd problems and smoking. Advice? (Warning: lengthy post) But please I need help.

This is a copy of what i posted on the r/adhd

Hi All,
I was diagnosed with adhd about 2 months ago and prescribed ritalin 10mg twice daily. I am a smoker and i was having the time of my life. In 2 weeks i literally turned my whole life around. I got a job, got on top of my debt and was generally a happier person.

I was so happy in fact that i decided "why not quit smoking". I went with the doctors recommendation of champix and thats where things started to get interesting. I followed the champix instructions to the letter and everything was going great up until about 6 or so days into the full dose. 

My brain fog came back immensely, my energy lebels dissapated and although i was able to put the smokes away i couldnt deal with the repercussions. 

So i contacted my psychiatrist and made an appointment with him. I told him basically everything above and he suspected the champix was having some kind of unintended affect so i stopped taking it. 

3 days after stopping the champix and i am doing great, still not smoking but the effects of the ritalin are still not having their intended effect so my dose was increased to 20mg twice a day or any variation. 

I then started feeling so incredibly anxious and in a moment of weakness picked up smoking again. Now when i take ritalin (ive brought myself back to 10mg) it's only half effective. I think im able to concentrate better but my motivation has tanked again, even on 10mg my heart rate peaks unless i use some oral spray to help with stress levels. Im taking other medication now to help me sleep (all natural and checked with pharmicist to ensure no interaction). 

I just want to get back to optimal and do it in such a way where i can quit smoking and cut the anxiety out. Does anyone have any advice on where to go from here?

Smoker for 15 years

I started smoking at 15 years old. I turned 31 a week ago and am proud to say that today is day 10 cigarette free! It’s had its rough moments. Was there a point where it seemed to all of a sudden just get easier? Where the cravings really started to taper off? I’m still struggling through triggers of driving, having a drink (been avoiding alcohol for this exact reason but went to a going away party last night and oof I wanted a cig so bad!), smoking coworkers, stress....! Triggers are everywhere! Hoping for some relief soon.

Day 1... Being assisted by a vape. Feeling nervous in case I fail

Hi /r/stopsmoking. A while ago I posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/3b3fkt/good_idea_to_book_leave_for_quitting/). Well, I decided to wait until I booked leave after all. It gave me time to research e-cigs properly, find the shop, buy one and get (relatively) used to it. Yesterday was my last cigarette day. Funnily enough I barely got to smoke as I was either in an all day meeting or on a plane! I've been (inconsistently) tapering off these last few weeks. 

Today marks the day I stop with tar, all of that nasty stuff that cigarettes have brought to my body for the last decade or so. I want to eventually no longer need nicotine too, but I am taking things one step at a time. It's been over 12 hours since my last cigarette. I've had the odd puff of the vape. Help me stay strong!!

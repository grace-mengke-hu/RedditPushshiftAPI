Really good reason/motivation for ME to quit...

This girl I'm "talking" to said she would only give me a blowjob if I quit smoking....and she gives really good blow jobs. We defined quitting (for the immediate future) to simply mean 24 hours. Alas, I'm very excited for tonight...

I don't want to quit simply for someone else. I'm training for a marathon (currently in my fifth week), and I'm excited to see the differences once I have gone a little while without smoking!! Thus, I'm quitting for the blow jobs and the improved performance in my running...

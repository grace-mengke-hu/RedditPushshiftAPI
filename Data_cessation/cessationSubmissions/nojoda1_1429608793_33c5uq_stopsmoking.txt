This is the third day of my third attempt

Hello guys. I'm 5 year old smoker and usually go through a pack in two days (could last less but it's too expensive) I've quit smoking cold turkey because of a number of factors, also, cravings aren't that bad so far.

1. Caught a really strong flu on Sunday that felt like I couldn't breathe at times.

2. I live in Venezuela and smoking is becoming a luxury thanks to hyperinflation (In less than a year, the price of a pack has doubled and it's expected that it'll double again in the next few weeks). I made some calculations (comparing Florida's minimum wage with what we got down here) and I came to the conclusion that it's as if you american folks paid around 30$ (soon 50$+) for a pack.

3. Smoking just sucks. It pisses me of having no stamina when playing sports because of this habit. Doctor ordered me to start taking swimming lessons because I suffer from scoliosis and I think this is the perfect chance to quit. Also the smell. Oh, THE SMELL.

**TL;DR** Flu, Hyperinflation and swimming got me to quit.

Anyway, I think the way you guys support each other is very nice. I'm proud to be a part of this community. Wish me luck! (I think I need to update my flair lol)

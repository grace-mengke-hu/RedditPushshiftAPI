How long did it take you to prepare for the quit?

I am at "hate smoking, absolutely have to do this, but not *quite* ready". 

Last time, I devoted a lot of mental energy to preparation, in a way. I made a "nightmare" board of all the diseases you can get, effects on looks, etc. I also made a "dream" board of images of  being free and healthy, pictures of myself as a kid (before smoking), etc... I just am not in the same place right now, for some reason. Any tips?

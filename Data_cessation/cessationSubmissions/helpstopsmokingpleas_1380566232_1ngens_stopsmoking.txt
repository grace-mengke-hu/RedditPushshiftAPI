What was your quit date on Chantix?

Hello! I'm not a smoker but my SO is a heavy smoker (2 packs a day maybe a little more). He's 29 and has been smoking since 14 years old. I'm so anxious that it will not work!! He has the most addictive personality I have ever seen. With him, it's 100% or nothing. He is on day 2 of taking it and still smoking the same amount. (As expected)
What was your quit date after you started?
5 days?
1 week? 3 weeks? more?

Thank you for your input!

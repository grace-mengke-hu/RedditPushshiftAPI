Made it 24 hours then caved

Trying to quit cold turkey since nicotine replacement never seems to work for me. I pushed myself to go 24 hours just to see if I could. I did it but gave in to the cravings immediately after the 24 hour mark. Guess I'll try again tomorrow. At least I've proven to myself that it is possible.

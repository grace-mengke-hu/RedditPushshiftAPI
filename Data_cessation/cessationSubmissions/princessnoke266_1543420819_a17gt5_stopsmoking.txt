I want to make a genuine effort to quit. Where do I start?

29 year old female, smoking for 14 years. I've reduced what I smoke to about 2-3 per workday/weekday but when I'm home for a whole day/weekend, that easily becomes 7-8 a day. And when I go out for drinks, maybe a half pack if not more. 

I want to quit so badly and sick of hiding my habits from family and coworkers. I hate thinking about being diagnosed with something terrible as a result of smoking. Mortality is running through my mind more than ever and although death is imminent I was to extend my life expectancy by quitting and living a healthier lifestyle. 

I have the full support of my SO but not really sure what he can do for me other than words of encouragement so I try not to lean on him or anyone else with this since this is really a journey for me mostly.

I don't know where to start or what to try, I just know cold turkey is not an option for me.

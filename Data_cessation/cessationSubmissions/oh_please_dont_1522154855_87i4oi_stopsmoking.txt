day 5, but cravings get worse.

been at it for 25 years (now age 41), i do want to quit for myself and my family. i  used the "craving to quit" mindfulness training which had worked once before, for about 6 month. now i really want this to be the last time. but i just want to throw things against the wall!! arrrrrrgh! you promised it gets better after day 3, but it just keeps getting worse!

i can't find anything to fill that gaping hole in my belly. *please* tell me this is normal and things will start to get easier soon?

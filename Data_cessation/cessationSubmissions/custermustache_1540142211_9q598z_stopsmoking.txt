I quit all nicotine 60 days ago.

I have smoked for 30+  years, and on the 1st of January I bought a juul and stopped smoking.  60 days ago I gave away my juul to a coworker and stopped all nicotine altogether.

I quit once before for about 7 years, and “just one smoke” turned into another 4 years of cigarettes. I will never touch a cigarette again.

I just wanted to share with someone.

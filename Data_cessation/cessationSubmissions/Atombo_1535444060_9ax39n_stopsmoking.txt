Survived my first BIG hurdle in the process

So I've quite for 2 months already, but last Thursday I went to a concert of one of my favourite bands. Since I have a different taste in music than my friends, I often go to concerts alone. I don't mind, I go for the music and it's actually quite nice to go alone since you don't have to take others into account.

Anyways, normally when I do this, I spend my time between the opener and the main act in the smokers lounge. If I'm early, I spend the time before the opener there as well.

I ended up planning my entrance just as the opener ended and spend the time between them and the main act by getting a beer and looking at some merchandising.

It took some planning and mental strength, but I was really expecting myself to fail and go into the smokers lounge to ask someone for a cig. Yay me!

I want to stop smoking but I want to keep smoking - HELP!

Guys, I've been silently reading in this sub for a while now and decided to subscribe and post something for the first time today.
I am 25, female, and I've been smoking cigarettes for 8 years now. For the last 6 years I've smoked about 20 cigarettes a day. I know everything about the health risks, I am aware of the huge amount of money that I spend on slowly destroying my body, and I am often ashamed to be seen smoking in public because I know that it carries a social stigma. I have read Allen Carr's book twice and I understand everything he says, it all makes sense to me.
So despite knowing all the facts and having great people in my life who would LOVE for me to stop smoking and who would support me in any way they could, I just feel like I can't. This morning, for example, I woke up and thought "Maybe I'll just quit today." but everytime this happens I immediately get an anxiety attack and feel like crying when I think about the future without cigarettes. I do have a history of being easily addicted to almost anything, but never before have I met an addiction that my willpower just can't defeat. I do want to quit, but I just can't decide on my last cigarette. I keep thinking "One more." or "Okay, after this pack I'll quit." 
I know that it's the nicotine that is making me so sentimental, but I guess what I need is to hear from you guys that it's really not that hard. I would appreciate any tips you can give me on how to prepare my mind for quitting: I know it's absolutely pathetic, but I feel like I'm losing a big part of my life. Is there anyone out there who felt the same way and made it?

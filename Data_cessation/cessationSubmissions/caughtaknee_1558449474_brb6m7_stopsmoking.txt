Today was that day when I really wanted one. This group stopped me.

It's almost been a week. But work today was a whole new experience of being anxious and afraid and absolutely exhausted. I just wanted that smoke so bad.

It was something strange that stopped me for that split second and it was my hair still smelling like my cinnamon shampoo. I always did like the scent, it honestly smells like Christmas cookies. 

So I went back and read the comments that were on my first post and they really did inspire me to keep going. I'd just like to say thank you for that. I just sat and waited out my timer like someone suggested. I'm really grateful, I can't lie.

Now I'm putting on a face mask and telling myself that the day is over and I never have to go through that again.

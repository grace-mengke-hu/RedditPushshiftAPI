How exactly do I deal with withdrawals

After several hours of not having any nicotine I get a damn near uncontrollable rage. 1 day and my girlfriend doesn't feel safe around me. The cravings get so bad that I think about robbing the store just of a couple packs. I've been smoking cigars and taking nicotine lozenges, but I feel like I'm consuming more and more as time goes on. 2 cigars would last me over a day, but now it lasts 2 maybe 3 hours and I'm back to the lozenges which don't really help with cravings. 
I know that taking nicotine is prolonging the inevitable, but how the hell am I supposed to do it? I've struggled with addiction before and I've grown up watching family going in qnd out of rehab, but this is fucking terrible dude. It's like full on heroin withdrawals.

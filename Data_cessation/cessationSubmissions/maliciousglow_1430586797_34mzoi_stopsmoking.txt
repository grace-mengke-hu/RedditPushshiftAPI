Had my last cigarette April 28th.

It was a normal day and I noticed I had a cough. My son had been sick, so I assumed I got his cold. Smoked my last cigarette that day, empty pack, and decided not to buy anymore.

Yesterday, I went to the doctor and they told me my cold had turned into bronchitis because of my smoking. However, the nurse praised me for not smoking anymore since I developed the cough and basically gave me the thumbs up as a former smoker herself. My husband is very pleased, even though this is my millionth time quitting. (I made it eight days my longest stretch).

Honestly, I've only been smoking for about 18 months. At first it was one or two a week, but it morphed into several a day. Thankfully I was never a pack-a-day smoker, but I really enjoy the taste of the clove mini cigars (Djarums) that I partake in. I know full well there is no reason to smoke, but I will miss the flavor of those sticks, especially since I have not found a vape that pleases me.

Thanks for listening. I'm serious about quitting and I think we all know a little support goes a long, long way.

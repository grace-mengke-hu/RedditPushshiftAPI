Any advice for those trying to quit while living with a smoker?

My SO smokes about a pack a day. I usually come in around 1/2 a pack.  Instead of our usual monthly budget, I decided to put together an annual budget.  The result was staggering.  $4,485.20 on cigarettes each year.  They are around $8.60 per pack here.  

I figure that even if he doesn't quit, I can do my part and save ~$1,600.00.  Plus I'm asthmatic, and would save an additional $100 on prescriptions, not to mention that I would experience the joy of not waking up dying from coughing every morning.  

My question to you is, have you successfully quit while living with a smoker?  Do you have any suggestions for how this might be possible?  I tried to cut back to 5 smokes a day recently and he'd smell SO strongly of it when he'd come inside.  I don't think the reduction method is good for me anyhow.  Also, last time I "quit" I would just bum from him, which defeats the purpose.  

I need to do this, for my health, and my retirement.

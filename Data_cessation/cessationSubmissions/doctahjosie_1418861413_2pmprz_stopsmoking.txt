wanted to make my dad a quitting care package-ideas?

my dad has tried to quit countless times and some times are more successful than others. today he has been 21 days without a cigarette (430 not smoked!) cold turkey.
he doesn't like tooth picks or will do the patch or the gum.
i was thinking like some gum, candy, stress ball, maybe some motivational cards?
any ideas would be great. what helped you quit and stay quit?

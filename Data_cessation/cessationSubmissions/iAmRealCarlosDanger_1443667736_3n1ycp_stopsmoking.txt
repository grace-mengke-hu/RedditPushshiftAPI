Successfully completed 1 month! However, I got a question.

Hi all, I am delighted to tell that I have successfully quit and it is my one month anniversary today after having smoked for 12 years. I am pretty sure I am never going back to smoking again. 

However, I had started to feel some discomfort and pain in my throat for last few months when I smoked. Since I have quit, it has gotten much better and has gradually subsided over last one month but I still can feel little bit of that in the lower part of my throat. Maybe some of you ex-smokers could help me out...My question is, is it normal for ex-smokers to usually feel these kind symptoms from long term smoking even after a month? If things are improving at a steady rate, should I consider it part of the healing process or should I see a specialist if the pain/discomfort of throat/lungs don't go away completely within a certain number of weeks/months. Thanks :)

I just had my last smoke

I am a 18 year old guy who was been smoking daily for about 2 years. Many of yall probably think 2 years is not alot but it feels like if I dont stop it now it will destroy my future.
I mean nowdays every cigg that I take gives me a boost but at the same time I hate everything about it. I smoke a packet every three days and its wasting my money, time and most importantly my health.

Few weeks ago my mom found out and she got really sad and she started crying and that shit really crushed my heart. I promised her I wont touch a cigg again but after 1 day I broke my promise.

The reason I write this is to get it off my chest but also because I am honestly scared to start this journey I mean I barely remember the last the day I went to school and work without taking a few cigarettes in the morning, if I dont take it my brain does not want to function for the rest of the day.

And last but not least does some of you people have any good tips that could help me fight this addiction?

Thanks for reading and sorry if its a bit too long I am just really frustrated.

Allen Carr

I'm half way through his book, and already I don't want to light that next cigarette. When he was talking about pipe smokers, and how they occasionally tip their pipes &amp; drink that tar sludge that builds up in their pipes, I wanted to be sick. I'm gunning to finish his book tonight, and start to enjoy life as a non-smoker again tomorrow! 
It's a busy &amp; stressful time of year for me, something in my gut is screaming at me to quit. I suppose after 10 years of smoking, my body and mind has had enough. This is the first time that I'be actually been excited to quit! 

To those who have conquered their nicotine monsters, you're inspirations to a of us. And for those, like myself, who are at the start of this amazing journey, we can do this!

My experience with Chantix, also help?

I'm 18F and have smoked for about 3 years. I've been a pack a day smoker for roughly 2. After a pretty tough 180 in life, I decided to finally quit. I got my Chantix prescription and immediately set out to end my addiction.

The first two weeks were amazing aside from the nausea. I weaned down to about 5 cigarettes a day which was a HUGE success to me. Then the anxiety started. I'm not one to do pills, but I found myself asking a family member for one or two of their generic Xanax every couple of days, which helped. It was like being suffocated, I was always on the verge of a panic attack unless I had one. I wasn't using them to get high, just to calm the hell down. Soon I started to get more and more depressed about that tough life event and suddenly I was having serious thoughts of suicide. I doubt I'd ever do it, but as someone who hasn't really ever been depressed or suicidal, this really scared me. The tough life event wasn't anything I hadn't been through before, but for someone reason it made me truly want to kill myself. 

I realized a couple days later that it was definitely Chantix and Chantix might kill me. So I stopped that and I feel so much better. Now I'm smoking about 8-10 cigarettes a day but I'm not up to a pack again, thank god. 

So essentially, be careful with Chantix. I thought thoughts of suicide would never be a symptom for me but I was so wrong. 

And now for help, what should I try as a replacement for Chantix? I don't think I can quit cold turkey. ):

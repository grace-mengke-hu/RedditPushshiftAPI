To all of you who started smoking again after stopping for one year or longer: Why? Also, do you have any advice?

Still going strong, but I'm afraid of making a mistake. Any wise words? :)

EDIT:
Thank you so much for sharing your story! :) What I learned: The best thing to do is to never ever touch a cigarette again, no matter what. I'll try to think of your comments whenever I'm tempted / about to forget how long addiction lasts!

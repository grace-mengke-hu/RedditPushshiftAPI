New to this sub reddit. Need to stop smoking. Help!

I’ve tried a few times but I find myself wanting to just have that one last cigarette. Ahhhh it keeps happening. I have just stopped smoking weed and I’m just over a month. Now I want to stop smoking cigarettes. I need help, I know it’s broad but does anyone have any good tips or potentially quit smoking weed and cigarettes at the same time.

How can I be there for my partner who is trying to quit?

My partner used to smoke pretty regularly, but he quit when we got together. Now we've been together for nearly 3 years, and for the past year or so he's been smoking frequently (several sticks a day) to relieve stress. 

We see each other once a week, and him and I can be pretty busy, so we aren't able to communicate all of the time.

He wants to quit, but sometimes he'd rather not face it (it's a habit he has to avoid obstacles he faces) 

He's tried reading Allen Carr's easy way to stop smoking but he doesn't enjoy reading.

Any advice on how I can be there for him? Also, any tips or tricks to make quitting and avoiding cravings easier? 

Thank you!

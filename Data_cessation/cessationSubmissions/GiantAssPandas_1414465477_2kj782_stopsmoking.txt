30 DAYS! TEN Things I like about being smoke free..

1. Breathe better (don't really even have to use my inhaler anymore)
2. I can taste food/drinks sooooo much better.
3. I am finally able to stick to exercising.
4. I don't smell like cigarettes all the time.
5. My sense of smell is back now. (I never noticed the smell of smoke on other people until after I quit.  Now I can instantly tell if someone smokes.)
6. I am not a slave to buying and using cigarettes.
7. My mind doesn't wonder to smoking when I am bored, in a social setting, or just even plain chilling around.
8. (Not on most people's list) I can actually smoke weed now without coughing up a lung.
9. I have saved a good bit of money, even though it has only been a month.
10.  My skin, hair, and nails are looking and feeling healthier.  I can tell in the way I look now that cigarettes negatively affected my appearance. 

There is just ten reasons of why quitting smoking is friggin awesome. 
I'm sure I could think of a bunch more, but ten reasons seemed good for now.
If you are at the beginning stages of quitting cigarettes, I urge you to keep fighting those cravings because I promise it only gets easier.  Quitting smoking is one of the best possible things I could have done for myself at this moment in my life. 
And if you are one of those people thinking/trying to quit smoking.  I BELIEVE IN YOU, AND YOU CAN DO IT! 
Thanks guys for keeping me inspired to live life cigarette free.

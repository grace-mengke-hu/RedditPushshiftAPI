I've smoked for 10 years!!!

So, I've read the book four times, I get but it didn't work. I've tried patches, I'm allergic to them. I've tried the gum, the lozenges, the inhaler, e-cig (they taste like bubbles to me). I still smoke. I hate smoking. The feel, the taste, the buzz, the smell, dear god the smell! But I still smoke.

I'm very sensitive to medications that alter your moods and I'm afraid of trying chantix. Really afraid. But I feel it's my only hope. Most of my problems come from smoking. The money I could save from buying a $7 pack per day in 6 months could fix my car or buy me a tv. But I still smoke. I'm to lethargic and depraved of energy from smoking to exercise. I still smoke. I overeat because I smoke all day and I don't realize how hungry I am until late night I finally am so hungry I binge, recently causing me to gain weight. 

I still smoke!! What hell is wrong with my brain? If I could just let go if smoking, I bet 85% of my life problems would, pooof! Disappear! Now I did enjoys Carrs book but it's simple everyday knowledge, it still takes will power and the right mind frame. I just feel lost in my life. And smoking is a big big problem that compounds problems.  But I still smoke :-/

I needed to rant. Smoking sucks and I've reduced my amount but I'm still stuck. I'm rereading Carrs book for a 5th time. So much of a better life with out smoking. I want it! I need it! I'm worth a life without cigs. Tonight after work I will run out of cigs. My 27th bday is in 11 days. I promised myself I will not be a smoker, I will not be over weight, my finances will be in order and my life will have direction and purpose by my 28th. One year. I can do anything in one year. After ranting I feel much better. Time to restart true living. 

Thank you /r/stopsmoking your a great bunch of people!!!

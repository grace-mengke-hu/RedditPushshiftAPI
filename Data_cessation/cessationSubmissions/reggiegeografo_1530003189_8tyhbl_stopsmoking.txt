Day 7 - Quit Cold Turkey

I quit cold turkey 6 days ago and started doing jogging, walking, running, skateboarding and many more AGAIN! Hobbies that I set aside for a puff of cigarette. And guess what, it's only been day 6 and never had the urge of getting a stick.

The first and second day was tough though, I attempted to buy a pack from a nearby store only to remind myself why I decided to quit smoking and ended up not buying the pack itself. (I went to the store 3 times, the owner noticed I'm hesitating to buy the cigarette, and gave a piece of advise - he's also an ex-smoker).

Fast forward to Day 6. I can normally jog, walk, run and skateboard without easily getting tired. And I'm loving the new me now. Keep going everyone.

BTW, I'm 30 and been smoking for roughly 10 years. I am proud to say that I am now an ex-smoker!

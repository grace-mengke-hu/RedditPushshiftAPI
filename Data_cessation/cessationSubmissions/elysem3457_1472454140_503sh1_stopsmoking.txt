Shocked

For months and years I've doubted my ability to smoke. Now, I'm 6 days smoke free and have never felt better!! The habits are really hard to break but the cash in my pocket makes it better!! My best advice I can give is to find a buddy. You either want to quit with someone or buddy-up with someone else who has quit. My cousin and her hubby were my buddies. Other than my dad, they are the only two that know about my quitting, until tomorrow when I reach my one week goal. Having someone to talk to, lash out to, complain to, and ask questions to helps so much!! Non smokers don't understand what you're going through and won't be able to give you the full support you need/want. Thanks for the support on this message board and I wish you all good luck!!! 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻

Almost relapsed , but held to my heart

My mind said because you're depressed and want to kill yourself ,  you have to smoke , but my heart said , it won't make a difference and it is pointless. Once again I took a great decision. I realized to make a change , we have to act upon it and forget the end result. You guys are one reason why I could resist the urges. I love you all! 

Just to say , in this journey , I craved for smokes few times but will power helped me to overcome it.

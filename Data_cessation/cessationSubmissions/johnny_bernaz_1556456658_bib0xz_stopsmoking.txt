Stuff noone warned me about : trouble pooping

Now i dont know about yall but i used to start my day with a cup of coffee and 2 cigs first thing in the morning. After that it was usually straight to the toilet to poop.

Now im 3 weeks smoke free and im having trouble going. But fuck man, its the 3rd time constipation hit me after i quit. Its fuckin annoying.

Realized I smoked for 1/2 my life. Had to quit.

I'm 36 and realized I've been a smoker for 18 years. Pack a day. The reality of smoking for as long as I was not smoking was weird. Couldn't get past it. Married w two kids and it was just time. 30 days smoke free and it's great. Chantix helps. It's a miracle drug really. Fuck the side effect stuff. Take your second pill at 3pm not 9pm and you won't dream about crazy shit. My doctor laughed when I said I didn't want to take the chemicals in the drug. He said there is 2,500 chemicals in a cigarette and you won't take a blue pill twice a day? Cmon.

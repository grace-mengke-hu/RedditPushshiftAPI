Day 1-- I never thought I'd need help

Today's the first day of no smoking, and boy has it been rough. I have a road trip coming up at the end of the month where I'll be unable to smoke for 3-4 days, so I figured I'd start early and see if I can kick the habit all together.

Two questions I have are:
1) How long do the body cravings last?
2) What are some things you do to preoccupy yourself when the cravings hit?

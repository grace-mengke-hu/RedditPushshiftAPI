4 days without any cigarettes or nicotine and I have a question.

I feel great. I've smoked about 10-20 cigs a day for about 13 years. This is the longest I've made it in I don't know how long... I'm not going back to it. I'm leaving it behind like a bad habit.

My question:

Does anybody else get a huge boost to their libido after quitting? I didn't even know it was being suppressed. Like, I feel like I'm 16 again. It's awesome and kind of overwhelming. 

What other benefits can I expect, not just the obvious ones? 

You guys are great. Thank you!

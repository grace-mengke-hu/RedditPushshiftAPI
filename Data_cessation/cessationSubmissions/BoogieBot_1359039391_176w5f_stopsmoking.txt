What do I do about the insomnia?

I haven't been sleeping well at all for the past 3 nights, and it just occurred to me that it might be because I quit smoking. 

I can't fall asleep until 1 AM, and not without the aid of MJ and a drink. Then, I awaken after 5 hours and can't get back to sleep at all! I've spent the last 3 days in a terrible, unproductive haze because of it. I need to be awake and alert and on point for an extremely important grad school interview tomorrow, and thus need to get a good night's sleep tonight. This is creating a terrible feedback loop of anxiety.

HALP. What do? MJ and a shot get me to sleep, but they don't keep me asleep. Perhaps I should take another shot when I awaken in the middle of the night? Has anybody had success with melatonin and 5HTP keeping them asleep through the night? What about benadryl? I just need 7 hours of sleep.

I am seriously tempted to go acquire a nicotine substitute tonight and take it, just so I can get some good sleep for once. But I also don't want to start counting days again! :[

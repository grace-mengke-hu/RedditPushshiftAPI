Quit Smoking, Start Breathing

I finished my last cigarette a couple of minutes ago. I smell awful. About a month ago I went a week without a cigarette. Ultimately, I caved and bought a week. These past couple of weeks I've been using the stresses of life as justification for relapsing and smoking heavier than I would consider. My smokers cough and the burning in the back of my throat serves as a reminder of my filthy, unhealthy, expensive habit.

I'm better than this. You can't be the person you want to be by remaining who you are. I envision myself living without having to smoke. I'm tired of excuses and tired of trying to cover up the smell. I'm tired of putting off the habit. I'm done.

I hope this is my last time having to create a throwaway and post one of these threads.

Hyperactive, racing thoughts and increased sex drive?

Not a smoker, but a snus user for the past 15 years. Quit last Saturday and it's going fine. I had to quit because my tobacco use was causing some hefty anxiety.

But after I quit a lot of characteristics that I had when I was younger appear to be coming back. With a vengeance.

I'm very happy about my sex drive to be honest. Feels good to get that back. It's almost as if I'm going through puberty one more time. Lets hope I won't start listening to Korn and Limp Bizkit again.

Is this common when one quits smoking or using snus?

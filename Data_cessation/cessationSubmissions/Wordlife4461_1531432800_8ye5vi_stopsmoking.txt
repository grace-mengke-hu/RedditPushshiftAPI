Quit Smoking and Opened a Smoke Shop.

2 years days ago, to the day, I quit smoking cigarettes and cigars. 60 days ago, I became incorporated and opened a smoke shop in my hometown. 

Anyone care to discuss the morality of my decision? I've been contemplating it for hours every night while laying in bed, I know the horrible nature of the addiction. However, it's quite a profitable market and the smell in my humidor is quite pleasant, especially when I am opening the store at 7:00AM. 

I'd like to hear the thoughts of smokers, and ex-smokers.

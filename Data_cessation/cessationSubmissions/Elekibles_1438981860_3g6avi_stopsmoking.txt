You won't believe what you can buy for lunch instead of a packet of cigarettes!!

All of this. This is what a packet of smokes is worth. In recognition of making it to ten days smoke free (and saving myself $243) I bought myself some lunch, to go alongside my girlfriends yuuuummy macaroni cheese! :3

Today's mission: "a craving is not a command, and neither cravings nor moods last forever. Your mission today is to let them pass. Don't try and change them, don't judge them, and don't judge yourself for having them. Simply don't respond to them and they'll pass."

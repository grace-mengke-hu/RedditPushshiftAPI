Finally reset my counter.

March 14th would have been 3 years smoke free for me. Instead, I relapsed last summer for reasons I can't even remember and smoked for 9 months. It took me 3 whole days before I was back to half a pack every day. 

But today, I reset my badge. I have some kind of upper respiratory infection and decided, "screw it, I'll stop so I can actually heal." 

I'm on day 4 and the cravings are terrible. Even writing this makes me want one. I didn't tell myself going in that I was quitting forever, because for whatever reason that makes quitting seem impossible. Let's hope that my little trick works and that I didn't jinx myself by posting...

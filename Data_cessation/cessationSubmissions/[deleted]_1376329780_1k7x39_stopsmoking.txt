E cigs do work!

I hope I do not offend anyone by posting here. I quit smoking in October of 2012 almost by accident.  I had no intention of quitting at that particular time but I had got some e cig kits for family members that needed to quit due to health issues.  Upon purchasing these kits, I had tried one and I fell in love! My wife and I have not smoked a cigarette since, my mother who has health issues that are directly connected to her smoking for 30+ years also never picked up a cigarette again.  

Through feeling the impact of not having cigarettes in my life and seeing how e-cigs had a positive impact on others health, I decided to open an online e-cig shop.  We now sell primarily e juice and we carry starter kits to get people into 'vaping' and help them quit smoking at a fair price.  Check out our site, we have great products to get you started and we always answer emails and private messages immediately to help you with your questions.  Right now we are offering 3 free bottles of e-liquid with all kit purchases, that amount of liquid should get you through your first month of vaping.  Our link is below and please don't hesitate to reach out with any questions prior to purchasing! Good Luck!

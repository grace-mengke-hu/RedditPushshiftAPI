Problems after quitting

Hey guys keep up with the fight, it will get easier I guarantee you. Smoked for 15 years heavily and quit almost 3 months ago with a single relapse that lasted for half a pack but i don't take it very badly, as it's still miles and miles better than if I continue to smoke.

Shortly after I stopped smoking I realised i am getting mouth ulcers very easily, but I am also eating more of the ulcers inducing junks after I quit. I've had gum bleeding problem too but that subsided after about 2 months in, they bled easily and I read that is a common thing after quitting. 

Anyone encountering the same or knows anything about the ulcers? it's the kind of ulcers you get if you ate too much biscuits. thanks

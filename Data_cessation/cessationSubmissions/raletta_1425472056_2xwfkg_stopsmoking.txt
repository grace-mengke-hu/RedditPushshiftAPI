Worst days

The first 3 1/2 days were easy but now it is getting really hard. I constantly make up excuses to start again. I feel like a crazy person having an argument with myself. I was even afraid to go to the grocery store because they sell cigarettes. On the way to the store I listen to Carr's audio book and didn't buy any. Right now I am drinking tea (and writing this) to distract me, but this day is really hard and I  think there will be many traps today(drinking with a friend,having a long break, waiting for a bus,...).
 But if I make it through today, it will be much easier in the future.

The other times I tried to quit it was also the 4th day and 10th-14th day, when I failed/had a hard time. What was the hardest day for you?

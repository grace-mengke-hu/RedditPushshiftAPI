Quitting: The ugly phase in real time

I am going to keep updating this as a sort of public diary to help me get through the worst few days. 

Day 1: Mostly okay. Surprisingly I got everything I needed accomplished at work and didn't just fall over and die like I imagined with the anticipation leading up to my quit day. I did, however, get overly frustrated with a desktop computer cause the mouse wasnt responding. Things got worse when I got home. I physically feel alright, but I keep randomly crying. I have no reason, just ridiculous tears for no reason. My poor male roommate just thinks I have the worst case of PMS he has ever seen.

Day 2: Decided to go play darts with some of my friends last night. Definitely took the mind off things (would recommend a similar activity to fellow quitters) and I felt like a normal person. However, coming home I couldn't sleep at all cause I kept having random crying spells-- I was ugly crying for no reason! So I decided to take some OTC sleeping pills to knock myself out. This combination just led to nightmares and me waking up at noon feeling like I was punched in the face. But I just made some coffee and breakfast and feel mostly normal again, just tired. Lets see how today goes...

Feel like I am in a cloud and everything is fake. Caved and bought some knock-off Nicorette (cause I am not a millionaire) and need a crutch. Trying not to beat myself up for giving into the nicotine addiction. But its really helping with the cravings and I might have to take this one step at a time.

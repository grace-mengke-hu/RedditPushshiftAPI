A few tips

I quitted smoking a while ago and I want think the first week was the hardest. Now I have stopped I have saved 528 Euros regained 445 hour and passed 1706 fags. 

I would like to give some tips that helped me trough. 
- If I had a craving really bad I just started to walk. Instead of smoking a fag in my break at work I just made a long walk which always seemed to help. 
- I kept in mind how bad I would feel about myself if I lighted up a sigaret.
- I remembered what my friend said after smoking his first sigaret after he quitted for 3 moths. " The craving went away for 30min but is was definitely not satisfying or worth it." 
- Remember that the cravings go away faster then you think.

Now I quitted for a while I had my first days that I didn't even thought of smoking!

You guys can do this!

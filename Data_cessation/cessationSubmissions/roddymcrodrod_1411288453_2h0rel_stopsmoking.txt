Fresh Start

So i lost one of my best friends to Cancer on Friday. She was 35 and an amazing beautiful person who lived life to the full only to be wiped out in the last 12 months. I woke up yesterday and decided i want to be here for longer if i can help it and the first step is just stopping. I smoked my last cigarette around lunch time yesterday and am feeling good. Got a little cranky last but if i keep things straight in my head this should go well.

My wife always struggles with me during a giving up attempt(this is not the first) as i become a bit of a horrible person on occasion. Anyone have any advice for someone who struggles with the anger?

Anyway not even sure what the purpose of this post was. Just wanted to get my reasons out there and to remember my friend. hopefully she will inspire me through this time.

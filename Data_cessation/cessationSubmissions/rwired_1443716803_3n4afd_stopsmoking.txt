To badge or not to badge?

Was a long time 50/day heavy smoker, but weened myself onto e-cigs 19 months ago, and have been extreme tapering since -- so slow that my brain doesn't register. I've been mixing in more and more 0mg juice for the past couple of months, and now for just 3 days I've been 100% nicotine free.

**But** ... I'm still smoking the 0mg e-juice. Apple or Vanilla flavors - no tobacco flavors. 

I still consider myself a smoker, even though I'm tobacco free and nicotine free now. The e-cig is still my crutch, so I won't be requesting a badge just yet.

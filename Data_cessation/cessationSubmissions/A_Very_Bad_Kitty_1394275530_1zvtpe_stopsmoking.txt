BOOM! 6 MONTHS CLEAN!

Well I'm not really active here but I just wanted to share this where people would appreciate it.

I started smoking a bit when I was 20. I was never a pack-a-day smoker, but it got to the point where I'd just chain-smoke whenever the opportunity arose, especially when out with friends.

I had two five-month spaces of being smoke-free since 2010. The first relapse was when my cat of 16 years died. The second I was just drunk and somehow my intoxicated brain rationalized a cigarette. I only smoked half of it and didn't even enjoy it, but then of course my membership to the 95%er club automatically reinstated itself. 

But thanks to just sheer determination, I've been off the ciggs since September 8th and I have no desire to ever go back to smoking. Even when my friends are smoking up a chimney and I get a slight urge to smoke, I just think, "Nope. Not worth how much I'll hate myself when I wake up the next morning." 

Anyway, just wanted to share my success with you all. Stay strong, my friends!

Smoke free for 50 days now! Still have anxiety

Decided to quit cold turkey after suffering from withdrawl after a weekend of anti-anxiety med binge. Pretty much haven't had any cravings but instead just have horrible anxiety. I think I'm a hypochondriac now and terrified of cancer, COPD, etc. I'm 19 and smoked for 3.5/4 years so I guess I have a smaller chance of all of these but that doesn't help anxiety. 

Anyone have any advice to deal with anxiety? It pretty much ruins my day most days now :(

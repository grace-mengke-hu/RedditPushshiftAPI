Dear Reddit, How did you quit smoking?

Just seeing how you guys did it. I feel that I am almost there myself. I'm down to under a pack a day. Took me years to get here though. I used to smoke over a pack a day of menthols. Can't wait to be done! I have a hard time trusting e-cigs/liquids, the patch gives me a rash with the added bonus of night terrors. So I guess I'm just trying to see what works for you guys. Any input is greatly appreciated!

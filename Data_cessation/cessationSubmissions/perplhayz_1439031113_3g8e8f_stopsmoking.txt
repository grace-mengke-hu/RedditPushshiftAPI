Get motivated, couple your quit with something that you really want to do.

Hey guys. I'm just checking in on day 5, soon to be day 6 after I wake up. I still fight myself from buying cigarettes and smoking to ease my before bed smoke craving, but it's definitely getting better. I just wanted to share what's been getting me through this. 
I know that the carrying a list around isnt anything new, but it's what I've written on it. For me, smoking has been a battle for me to try and quit. I'm 19, I have been smoking since I was 13, have tried quitting about 50 times, longest was a month, shortest was a few hours. It is a battle to quit smoking . Allen Carr didn't work for me. 

I am currently a undergrad that wants to get into medical school, a dream i've had for awhile now. But to do that I have to get a great GPA. I know that if I can quit smoking, I will have proven to myself and to my mind that I can really do anything. If I can beat something that's been getting the best of me for 6 years, whats really standing in my way to do what I think I may not be able to do? It's just you. It's just you standing in your own way. It's the same with anything in your life. If you are a long-time addicted  smoker who quit smoking, you have the guts, the grit and the determination to do anything. Literally. I don't want to sound premature since this is only day 5, but that's what I believe. It's what gets me through my cravings, and it makes me work even harder to my 9GPA goal this semester. If it works out, then hey, I will be back here to tellyou all about it :) . 

TLDR; You can quit; and when you can quit; you will have done what you think you can't do. And when you've done what you thought you can't do, what can't you do? :)

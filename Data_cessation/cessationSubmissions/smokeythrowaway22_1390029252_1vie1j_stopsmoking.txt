Psychosexual problems & Quitting Smoking

Hi guys - unsurprisingly throwaway account here. I'm a Male in his mid-30's with an active sex life and moderate level of porn consumption. I noticed over the last year or so I was having difficulty in getting erections with one night stands (to the point of beginning to use viagra) and wondered if it could be linked to both my drinking and smoking (and/or other emotional baggage). Anyway having decided to quit smoking around New Year I also decided to do dry january suspecting that it would help me on the smoking front too. Anyway - all has gone very well and I havent touched either, I've pretty much beaten my cravings and I've found the support/stories here a great help along with the quitnow app. My problem is that I've had a massive drop in libido - I've barely had a mischeivous thought since quitting and whilst I'm getting morning wood and the occasional random boner they don't seem to be as strong as normal. Can anyone help? Some casual googling suggests this is to do with the brain re-mapping its use of dopamine and that it could take up to three months to sort itself out!! I can honest;y say that this poses the single biggest risk of me smoking again - can anyone shed some light/advice?

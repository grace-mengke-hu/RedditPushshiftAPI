does nicotine gum prolong the suffering?

I'm starting day 5 today. 
I'm chewing 2-3 pieces of 4mg gum every day.
I'm also doing Zyban (6am & 3pm) and 0mg nicotine tobacco juice vape.
So in the morning before I take the Zyban and chew a piece of gum the urge to hop in the car and go buy a pack is huge.
I just wonder if I give up the nicotine gum will these cravings and urges go away? 
If I hadn't been chewing the gum the nicotine would be out of my system by now.

Thanks, day 5 non smoker/37 year smoker

Edit: Of course if I wasn't chewing the gum I may have hopped in the car by now.

15ish years of smoking, ends today

I've been smoking for roughly the last 15 years of my life. Wanted to fit in with my friends, or thought it was cool, or whatever, then never could quite give it up. I've tried (and failed) to quit a few times in the past, this time it will be different. I'm looking forward to being able to breathe again. Wish me luck

I bought a pack of cigarettes yesterday. And then...

2y 6m 10d since my last cigarette. I have been having an extremely stressful week. I caved and bought a pack of my old favorite cigarettes. On my way to the smoke area at work, a guy stopped me to ask how I was doing. I said I was stressed, and he replied with incredible compassion. He reminded me to not let life’s stressors get me down and that everything will work itself out. I continued on to the smoke area, hung my head, and didn’t smoke. Now, I can proudly say that it’s been 2y 6m 11d since my last cigarette. Not every day is easy, but the cravings will always pass.

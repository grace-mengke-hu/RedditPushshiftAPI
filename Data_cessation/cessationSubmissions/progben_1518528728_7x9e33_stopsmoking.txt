Nearly at 1 Week

What's up StopSmoking!

So in 90 minutes, I'll have gone a whole week without any cigarettes or tobacco. This is my second time kicking the habit after managing around 3 months last year. 

I'm way more confident this time, though, because the 'you've done so well, just have one cigarette' urge won't fool me this time. I hate that guy.

For anyone currently thinking about giving up, it's totally worth it. But it's also different for everyone and your mood/symptoms/craving level will fluctuate each day. 

Strangely, I've experienced almost no cravings for tobacco whatsoever. A couple of passing urges on Day 1, and then again on Day 6 when I got drunk, but nothing too bad. The rest of my days have been either not thinking about smoking or bumping into an old trigger and feeling a bit empty that I can't smoke for around 10 seconds. 

I have, though, suffered from quite a few psychological withdrawals; depression, anxiety, insomnia, mood swings, bizarre thoughts/behaviours, etc. They aren't pleasant but I'm trying to look at this as an illness I need to persist on breaking through to get my life back. 

Nothing worth doing is ever easy.

Should I keep my nicotine addiction for now?

I'm in my final 4 months of my master's degree. I'm stressed out just now, so many deadlines and a dissertation to do. I've been cigarette free for a week now with the help of a vape and nicotine lozenges.

Should I wait until after my finals before attempting to quit nicotine completely? I'm already stressed enough and don't think it would be a good idea to become lethargic and more stressed out with my body going through nicotine withdrawal.

Thoughts?

It's my mother's birthday today, my present to her is quitting smoking! (pic inside)

[Me and my mother last night!](http://i.imgur.com/CuwNSk2.jpg?1) How old do you think she is? Brownies for the closest guess! :D


My mum has always known that I smoke. She has voiced her disapproval many times but has mostly been very understanding of how difficult it is to quit, especially as I regularly smoke over a pack a day.


My sister and I are also saving up to go travelling next year, and therefore my mum didn't want anything big or expensive, she only said she wished that I stopped smoking...So I am!


I'm about 20 hours in so far, and struggling, but it will be worth it!


This time I will succeed!

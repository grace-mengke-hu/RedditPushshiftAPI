Question about the life of a non/ex smoker.

How long after you quit is the thought of a cigarette nonexistent. I see people on here say," it's been 4 year, and I occasionally get cravings." Does it ever totally disappear and the thought of it is gone to the same extent as someone who never smoked has it? Or are the occasional cravings something you fight for life?

Regardless today is day 12 of my no smoking. Rolling steady. 88 to go for triple digits.

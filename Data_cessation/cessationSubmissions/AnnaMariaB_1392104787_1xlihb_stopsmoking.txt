Sixth day....

My first two days were easy, the third a living hell and it's just getting worse! I thought it would get easier with time. I've been a chain smoker for half my life. Decided to stop because my skin has turned grey/red and the MONEY! Will it be easier?!
Someone said two weeks...
I don't want to fall back.

Smoking herbal cigarettes and have an electric fag in case of emergencies. (Every morning to my coffee)

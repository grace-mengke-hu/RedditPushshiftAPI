I quit for real this time!

16 yr smoker here -- at least I was until 2 days ago. Now I am a NON-SMOKER. Was in total denial about just how addicted I am. I have a high strung, addictive personality I guess and convinced myself smoking is just another form of self medicating. No, it's a form of self-abuse!

Thanks to this sub, I finally read Allen Carr's Easy Way all the way through, in about 45 minutes before I went to bed the other night. Woke up the next morning, had two cigarettes left, smoked them like meh and now I'm done. That was yesterday I think?

Amazingly, I haven't had any of the usual rage or anxiety this time around. Yes, I am having cravings. It's especially hard with my morning coffee or after I finish a workout (even when I was smoking, I walk 5 - 8 miles a day). But the cravings pass faster than they ever have on previous quits.

I have to drive somewhere tonight which really has me worried -- the car is a major trigger for me and I haven't had to use it since I quit. I really, really need to air out the car and prepare for this. I just typed "I may just bring an ecig just in case" but then I realized how stupid that is considering I am SO close to the 3 day mark nic-free and I hate the damn things. So no, no ecig. Gum and TicTacs, that'll work ;)

Super early in my quit, obviously, but I feel really, really good. To those who recommend Allen Carr, thank you. I have tried just about everything over the last 16 years and nothing has felt so natural. I had a real "duh" moment and I can't believe this was ever so hard before. 

And can I just say... I'm so glad Mad Men is over. That damn show would make me want to light up SO bad, ha.

Thanks for listening. Now to go scrub out my car...

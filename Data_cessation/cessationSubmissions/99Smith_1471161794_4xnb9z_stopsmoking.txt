Day 3 of quitting, got to go to work. HELP ME.

First day back at work since i've stopped smoking. Every single other member of staff smokes and since we have a lot of staff with easy roles within the company, they do a break cycle which means you are allowed a smoke break once every 30-45 minutes. How am I supposed to turn down taking a break from work more than once every hour. 
I don't think i'm going to take a break today, I think I will just power on through lunch to stop the temptation. I'll see how things go.. and let you guys know later. If anyone cares.

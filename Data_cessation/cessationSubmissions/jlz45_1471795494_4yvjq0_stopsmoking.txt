Anyone know if the pdf versions of allen carr that come up straight away from google are legit? I mean I glanced it over and they're filled with spelling mistakes and grammar errors but otherwise looks decent. Anyone try it out?

Sorry I'm on mobile not able to copy links. Literally the first results if you google allen carr easy way to stop smoking pdf. Thanks!

Entering day 3

I'm on day three. I have tried quitting multiple times over the past year or so, never making it more than a week. I'm hoping this time sticks. Work is extremely stressful right now and things at home aren't great either, making it hard to keep myself from using nicotine. Had a bit of a break down yesterday, but met up with a friend to vent about things rather than lighting up. I have to say too, it's amazing how much nicotine was jacking up my resting heart rate. I used to be at 75-80 just watching TV, I'm sitting at 55 now. My biggest challenge is dealing with my stress, anger, and depression that all start spiraling out of control everytime I try to quit.

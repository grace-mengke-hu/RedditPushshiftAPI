My first three days... the good, the bad and the ugly

**Day 1:**

The good - Smoked the last cigarette in my pack that morning, and meant it this time. Drove to uni, with nothing planned for the next few hours but studying. Usually sitting at a desk with my books is one of the worst triggers for me. Five minute smoke break is the perfect excuse to get up and relax your body and mind. But I drove right past a number of gas stations on the way to school, and didn't cave.

The bad - Didn't study very long that either. Got really restless and had to go back home after a couple of hours. 

The ugly - Chewed red man tobacco that night so I could get to sleep

**Day 2:**

The good - Went to the gym, and had an intense workout. Felt good, and felt even better not to have a cigarette before and after as I usually do. 

The bad - Working at the restaurant that night. Another huge trigger for me. After a couple of hours I caved and started asking just about every one in the kitchen I'd ever seen light one up if I could bum a smoke. Luckily for me, a few people in the kitchen had recently quit, and the others didn't have any. Made it through the shift, but only by chance. 

The ugly - Resisted the urge to buy smokes right after work by sitting at the bar and cramming a $10 toffee cake into my face. Fancy restaurant my ass, I don't care, I demolished that thing. 


**Day 3:**

The good - First full day I went without red man, or any other sort of nicotine substitute. Doing this shit for real now. 

The bad - Had a three hour evening class that night. Found myself staring off into space and getting real jittery. Did my best to pay attention and make it through the whole thing, but eventually had to rudely get up and leave with about half an hour left. Was getting massive cravings for food, and couldn't sit anymore, had to get up and move around. 

The ugly - Because my throat was feeling like I had strep by the time class was done, I bought a bottle of fireball, and started taking swigs whenever it got especially bad. By late that night, I was pretty much drunk. I started getting texts from this girl I know. We went out for a bit, but she since move away, and we broke things off. We're still friends though, so getting texted isn't surprising. But she starts texting about this guy she's been hanging out with, but doesn't wanna get too serious with, and wants advice. I flip out and bitch at her for thinking she has the right to use me for advice with another guy she's seeing. I still feel that way, but know my general irritability right now made me say some shit I never would have otherwise. (**tl;dr** - largely due to cravings and intoxication i'm no longer talking to a very good friend) 


**Day 4: (just started)**

Already know the ugly... woke up coughing balls of phlegm in the shower, and my throat feels like absolute shit. As for the good, well it's hard to think of anything good right now. Quitting this shit is having a negative effect on my school, my work, and my friends. But I suppose there's still one good out of all this... still haven't smoked. 

Thanks for reading my rambling account of the past few days..

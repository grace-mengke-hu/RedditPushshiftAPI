Insane craving .. feel like im not going to make it

I quit 93 hours ago. I used to smoke for 4 years , in the beginning barely as in 1-5 cigs a day but for the last 2 years i'v been Smoking a pack a day.
Right now the craving is insane .. my head is starting to make thoughts like " Just one , you'll quit another time and only smoke 1 " ! The fucked up Thing is i know that These thoughts suck but they Sound so good right now .. HELP PEOPLE :(

Edit: Sorry for the bad english , i am a german.

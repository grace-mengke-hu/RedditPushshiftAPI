Antidepressants making me smoke more than ever

I quit smoking before I got put on antidepressants (Effexor and remeron) and now I'm smoking more than I ever have. Not only am I craving them constantly, I'm always thinking about the next one. I used to smoke only when going out and now it feels like it's all im doing... 

Has this happened to anyone else? I want to quit but jesus its tough 

Any tips?

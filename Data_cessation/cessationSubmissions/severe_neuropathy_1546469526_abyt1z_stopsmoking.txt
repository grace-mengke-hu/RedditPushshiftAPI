One week down, a million to go.

Hey everyone. I quit smoking over a year ago, but I took the easy route and Vaped instead. I'm one week completely nicotine free as of this post, and I'm hoping for a tiny bit of support, because right now I would commit a fucking war crime for 1mg of nicotine in my blood.

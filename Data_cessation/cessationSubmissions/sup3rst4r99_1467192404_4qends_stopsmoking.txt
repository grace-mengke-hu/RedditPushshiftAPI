I need some input; Anxiety and depression

Hello!

I had recently been smoke-free for 2 years until I foolishly smoked a few packs while on vacation. This was 6 months ago. I've been trying to quit ever since and I've been unable to do so until a month ago when I went 27 days; Then I had a bad day with heavy anxiety and gave in.

To the point; I did not have anxiety or depression this bad at least when I was smoking before or during the 2 years off them. I think my mental state all boils down to the fact that I absolutely loathe myself for falling back into the trap when I was free and my failing to quit again.

Anybody has similar experiences and want to chime in? I felt pretty good from day 21-27 just this last time but I somehow forgot about all the good days when I had 1 bad day.

I have read a lot of studys online which claims that depression and anxiety eases when quitting (after the first weeks/months) but I would like to hear from real people if that's truly the case?

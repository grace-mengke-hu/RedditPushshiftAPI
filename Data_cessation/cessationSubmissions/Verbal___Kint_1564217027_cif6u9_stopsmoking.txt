Feeling strong

I'm out celebrating with friends and family. Honestly, I'm drunker than I've been in a long time, and the last time I was like this I was a pack-a-day smoker. The urges were strong, especially in a casino. I just kept reminding myself how much of a cheap bastard I am and that j don't want to start paying for cigarettes again. Also, breathing without coughing is pretty cool too...

Good luck to everyone else pushing through the struggle!!!!

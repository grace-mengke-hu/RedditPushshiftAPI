You know what made me giddy? Woke up after a night out and my hair (and clothes is I passed out before changing) didn't smell disgusting

A small mind puke here since you decided to read this far. It's been two weeks since I had a cigarette. First week I had a few cigarillos if I was really craving a smoke. I smoke /r/trees regularly, with and occasional dash of tobacco for fluff. So I feel not as free from it as I could be.

The hardest part has probably been walking to class. 15-20 minute walk, therefore a great time for a smoke. It gave me something to do. So I've just been listening to music a lot to keep my mind occupied.

You know how for some the worst holdback (or that's what I've read from 2 weeks of lurking here) for quitting is others telling you how hard it's to quit. That you'll crave it when you see or smell someone else's smoke causing you to say what the heck I'll have one and then deem yourself weak for it. I've been quick to force myself to look away from the smoker so I don't linger on how I should light one myself.

What I most enjoyed about smoking was the actual feel of inhaling the smoke. It felt... filling? I crave the smoke but not the taste. I guess trees kind curbs that, thus bringing me this far.

Cheers y'all

After months of having vivid smoking dreams, this was bound to happen!

Just woke up from a vivid dream about having been given a pack of cigarettes from a friend. Ive had many previous dreams about smoking and always always lit up and woke to immediate regret, worrying over if it really happened or not. But this was the first time I took a cigarette out from the pack then stopped myself from lighting up reminding myself that I don't smoke anymore! This feels like such a big step for me I think I deserve a cigarette! Jk, but you all know what I mean :)

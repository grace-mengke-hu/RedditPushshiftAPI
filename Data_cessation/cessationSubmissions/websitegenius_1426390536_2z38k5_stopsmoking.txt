11 days. Craving now stronger than ever, all day. Shouldn't it be gone by now?

The first 4 days were insanely hard for me, but I got through them.  Everything since then has been surprisingly easy--except for today, all day, I can't stop thinking about it.  

I don't want to go back, I don't think I'll crack, but it's just frustrating.  I thought the worst was over, but I think this is the worst so far.  When will this stop happening?

One day in, any help you folks could give a rookie like me?

One day in so far, after smoking for about 6 years. I've been using the generic nicorette gum and Ive read about the withdrawl symptoms and other obstacles that will lye ahead. What I'm asking for is any little hints and tips you guys could offer.

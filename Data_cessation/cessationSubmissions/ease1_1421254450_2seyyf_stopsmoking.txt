I just want my normal back...

I quit 3+ weeks ago and the cravings have gone for the most part but now I am battling mini panic attacks and mood swings.  I have read a bunch and know that I just have to hold on but it is so sick how my mind is attacking itself and my body is helping.

I quit caffeine, sugar and nicotine in one shot so I know that I am dealing with hardcore withdrawal.  It was really bad at first, my eyes wouldn't focus right and my concentration was shot.  It has gotten better day by day but it is like slow torture.  My mind keeps telling me that I am going pass out and go down like a sack of shit when I am walking outside sometimes.  It comes and goes but it is definitely panic and with no real triggers.  

It is like a knife fight in a dark room and it stabs me in the back with the things I love the most.  Like, "What if when you are out with your daughter you have a panic attack and pass out" and then I start to panic..."just smoke and you will be ok" my mind tells me.  I can control it to a degree and it is getting better but I am just so fucking pissed -- I want to have a fist fight with myself and be done with it.  I have never passed out in my life and I rarely panic so I get even more pissed that my mind is doing the "don't think about a pink elephant" nonsense and creates then issue.

I know it will pass and this shit will just be a bad memory but it just fucking sucks that I can't enjoy quitting considering I was beating myself up everyday for years about it.  

I just need to vent and to know that I am not broken, just reading the posts here have been extremely helpful.

I let a cold go too long and got bronchitis

I'm coming up on 2 years 4 months with no cigarettes. It's been as long since I woke up with chest tightness, sore throat, coughing up gunk, and I have to say, I have not in the slightest of ways missed this feeling. I sometimes think back on the things I put myself through when I was smoking wondering why I did it, but physically feeling this all over again, I willingly felt like this? Gotta say, given the choice between coughing myself to death and waking up breathing, it's not a hard choice which is better.

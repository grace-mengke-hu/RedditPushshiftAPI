My List of Stuff I Don't Miss.

* Doing something that is going to kill me.

* If I left my cigarettes and lighter in the car and was somewhere longer than expected, bumming smokes and having to hear that SAME stupid ass one-liner.  "Want me to smoke it for you too?"  I never have to risk hearing that again.

* Having that lingering smell on me.  For hours.  It never really went away.  I only got used to it.

* NOT being a good example to my little sister.

*  NOT being a good example to little kids that see me smoke.  Not like it's a serious big deal, but it's a good thing no doubt.  I always thought about that kind of stuff when I saw little kids notice me smoking.  Like if I was wearing a cool t-shirt and having a cigarette, I never wanted someone young to look at me and think that this is what cool people do or something.  

* Being overly emotional when I didn't have one.

*  THIS ONE IS THE WORST ONE OF ALL.  That feeling of not being happy no matter where I was or who I was with if I didn't have cigarettes.

* **NEEDING** one first thing in the morning.

*  Getting a burn mark on my $2000 jacket that I just bought the week before.

* My pet not liking it.

* Running the risk of getting lung or throat cancer.  That's a big one.  HUGE.

* Breaking **LOTS** of stuff because I was trying to quit and got frustrated.  That awful addiction driving it's dirty claws into me as it dies a slow, agonizing death.  Later, bitch. 

Thanks for listening.

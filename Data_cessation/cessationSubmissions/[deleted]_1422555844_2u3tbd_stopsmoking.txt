I guess this is the test

So I've been a lurker here for like a year, planning to quit. 
but earlier this month i thought i met someone and i was in such a good mood cigarettes started becoming less important. So im thinking, yeah i might do it.
Now this week i got a bit of a cold and a cough so i said fuck it, and i haven't smoked in 2 days, i use a shitty e cig when i really hit a wall, but i have felt so good talking to her lately i have not cared.
Of course today she calls me during work and says you know "blah blah im not over this last guy idk what i want etc" and kinda crushes me. So we got done wrapping things up and i hang up.

Boom 
I wanna smoke so bad i mean its not like i have anyone whos gonna care now right? Fuck it im better than that. 

I always fuck up and let women control how things go but I'm not gonna smoke i can control that at least.

Some advice please

I am not a smoker but my dad is. I was tricked into thinking that my dad gave up smoking when I was born. A few months ago, I realized that he was still smoking daily, just behind my back. I am 19 and he is almost near 60. As far as I know, he has been smoking since his 20s. I have confronted him multiple times, but nothing works; he just ignores me and yells at me. He is coughing more frequently and being very distant now. What can I do? 

I want to be angry at my dad but at the same time I am very sad, from being lied to and seeing my dad's health deteriorate.

Nicotine withdrawal?

Hey everyone, I have a few questions regarding nicotine withdrawal.

So I used to be addicted to cigs but quit that and substituted it for even higher nicotine electric cigarettes, like juul or  phix. I went from hitting one a few times a day to burning through pods in 2-3 days on some occasions (4 juul pods = 1 pack of cigs, 4 phix pods = 2 packs of cigs). Both were about 50mg nicotine. After I stopped getting buzzes I moved onto breezes which hit so much harsher and had such a better headrush. 

Well, anyways, now i've gone cold turkey to all nicotine products. I'm on my 5th day and for now doing good but i was craving nicotine so much it was insane. I never acknowledged how addicted I was until I tried to kick it and it's been near impossible. How long will these cravings last? Thanks for any advice

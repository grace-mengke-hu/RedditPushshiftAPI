Second day on the nicotine patch, and...

So far, my day wasn't that bad. I'm currently on a 21mg nicotine patch for a couple of weeks and I didn't seem to experience any cravings. However, I did feel some guilt after failing a Math midterm. When I got my results back, I thought about the past few weeks that I spent smoking. While I smoked, I felt very antsy, shaky, distracted from my studies, and, most of all, bad about myself and my own low self-confidence. A part of me thinks that I can do this, but another part of me is afraid that I'm going to relapse and start the whole process over again. 

Some steps that I'm trying to take include avoiding smoking areas around my college campus, refusing to look at cigarette boxes at gas stations, and deciding to stay away from my local coffee shop due to the heavy smoking that takes place there. 

I don't know if I can do this.

24 years old, 10 year smoker.. 1 week smoke free :)

So I started socially at 13 or 14, unfortunately. The last 2 years have definitely been the worst, I have been smoking 30g in 3 days... And feeling awful for it. I have managed to maintain a really healthy life despite being a heavy smoker. I am puritanical about what I eat, I exercise and am fit... Smoking was(WAS!) my one vice.

I haven't smoked for a week. It actually has been easier than any other attempt. I have been cold turkey this time round but have quit with Alan Carr method years ago... to no avail (3 months free).

At the moment my biggest trigger is drinking, but I don't feel inclined to drink alcohol and haven't had a drink for 3 weeks. Coming up to Christmas and New Years will REALLY push my limits... I will be surrounded by people drinking and smoking, which I have done for sooo much of my life. I just hope I am with more people who don't smoke so I don't feel inclined.

I am just posting here now as this is the best progress I have ever made. Keep up the good work everyone.

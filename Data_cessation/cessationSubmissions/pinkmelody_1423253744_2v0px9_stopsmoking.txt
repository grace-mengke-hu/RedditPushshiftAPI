No real cravings or desire to smoke- but bitchiness and depression are rearing their ugly heads.

Smoking grosses me out enough that I don't want to do it, but I cannot shake this bad attitude.  I'm doing things that make me happy like finishing my homework, going to the gym, eating right, etc.  Still, all I want to do is sleep, read, and talk to no one.  Feel pretty bad for my husband right now.  I don't think he really gets it.

Last night I drank (moderately). My husband drank heavily.

Drinking is my biggest hurdle since my very first cigarette was consumed in conjunction with my very first drink.  I have always associated drinking with smoking. So, I inevitably always relapse when I drink. 

Last night my husband, who is also trying to quit but only smokes while drinking, took some “hits” off of his buddy’s cigs early in the night. Later in the night he came to me and asked me if I wanted a cig (because he did and he wanted us to jump into failure together, this is almost always what my relapses look like). I responded “I don’t”.  Then I went to bed. He smoked one and came to bed shortly after feeling guilty. I didn’t and I feel really really proud. 

That’s all. Just patting myself on the back.

Withdrawls

One thing I've learnt from relapsing from my stop smoking journey is that the most important battle is withdrawals. You must plan for as many cessations that you think you'll get or track them to prep for them. I relapsed, 7 weeks after quitting because I didn't have a plan for my withdrawls.

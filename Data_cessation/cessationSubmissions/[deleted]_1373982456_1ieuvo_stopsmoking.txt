180 days! It all seems like a dream now.

I tried quitting a couple times before in the past, but never really made it too far. Tried that E-cigarette thing, it just made me miss Tobacco even more. I read Allan Carr's "easyway to stop smoking" and it only made me last a couple days the first time around.

It isn't until you really look around yourself and realize that you are wasting your time/money doing these awful useless cancer sticks. Everyone has a different way of stopping the smoke, and I forced myself out of it by a combination of things.


-competition

-got rid of stress triggers

-financial

-promises

-distractions

-exercise

-health

The more things I tackled on to the list, the more I stuck to my determination.

As soon as I hit that 5th day, I made it an obligation to stick to it. I re-read The Easyway, whenever I was thinking about or "craved" cigs. I made  post. I exercised. I ate better. I did whatever i could to resist the urge to buy another pack and cave in.

At some point in your life, you can't turn back. I made sure going back to cigarettes wasn't an option in my mind. Even 30 days in when I had bought a pack, I took one cig and threw the rest away. I wasn't going smoke the whole pack because i knew, it would reset everything I suffered for.

I smoked that one cig, thinking I would enjoy it. It tasted awful and didn't make me feel better at all. All it did was make me cough a few times. *Six dollars for this!? What the hell am I doing?!*

At that point I knew it wasn't worth it. I was done fighting my brain. Finally, the logic sunk into it and a burden was lifted off my shoulders.

Though, don't get me wrong. Every now and then, my brain craves that feeling- no, the experiences, the memories of when I did smoke the cigarette. It's funny, once you tie something into your life, you somehow feel as though you are missing it till you once again get it back.

Once you do get it back, it isn't the same, because it was the experiences and the friends is what made the times great. Not that shitty cigarette you wasted your money on.

Anyways, this is a long enough post so I will stop there.

tl:dr **I am 180 days free. I feel great and look the part I could imagine it only gets easier from here.**

Toothpicks?

Despite my badge count, I have some experience in attempting to quit. I know what does and doesn't work for me. I like the gum because of the nicotine and the action. 

A nice supplement, for me at least, is a toothpick. Besides something to fidget with, I also notice having one in my mouth helps me mimic the deep inhale and exhale of a cigarette. Even without one, the deep breaths help me relax. 

Anyone else experience this type of reaction to something like this?

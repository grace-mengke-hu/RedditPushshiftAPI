Here we go...

Last smoke done. I need to get my head straight - I have two kids that I love more than life itself, and I'm terrified they will have to see me die. It's a fear that has consumed me for the last two years - many failed attempts at quitting for the last 20. It depresses me so much to admit that, to the point that I went to some therapy sessions for anxiety and depression. I'm not a heavy smoker - no more than 4-5 a few days a week, none at all during the day or at work, but pretty heavy during my stupid 20s. It bothers me so much all that time and money and health I wasted when I could've been becoming a better person. I had some issues a la sexual abuse in my late teens and I think I spent the better part of the next decade trying to numb myself...

This *should* be very doable. 

I'm scared. Is it too late for me? My kids need their mom. ðŸ˜¢ I've never had a cough and my blood pressure has always been stellar. No family history of anything scary.

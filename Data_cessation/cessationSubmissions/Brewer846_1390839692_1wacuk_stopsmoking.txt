I'm on Day 6 and I feel like a basket case

So, after numerous tries over the past 2 months, I finally managed to get beyond two days after reading the easyway book. 

I'm now on day 6 and I feel like I'm on an emotional roller coaster.  The worst is that I feel like there's a low grade depression that's constantly in the background and it's throwing my emotions, and my reactions to things, completely off kilter.  

It gets better ... right?

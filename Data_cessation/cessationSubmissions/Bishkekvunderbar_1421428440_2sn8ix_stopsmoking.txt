One week in

And I'm feeling great about it. I've tried and failed to quit multiple times before this over the years, but I think I was in the wrong headspace then...because I'm finding it really easy. Not that the cravings haven't been bad...the first three days were really rough emotionally and physically. But nowhere during that time did I have any desire to go back to it. I feel like a profound switch has been flipped. I'm a little frightened that it'll hit me when I'm not expecting it, but for now I'm just going to enjoy my smoke-free life.

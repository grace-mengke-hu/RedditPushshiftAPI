How did you know it was time to quit?

My boyfriend and I have been dating for 5 months. He HATES smokers, and I've been telling him I'm trying to quit. Whenever he smells it on me we get into a huge argument and it always comes down to the ultimatum: Smoke again, and I'll leave.

I never really smoked around people unless they were smokers and when I started dating my boyfriend I cut down drastically to smoking when I had a night to myself. However, I would end up chain smoking to "make up for lost time/get it while I can" (think 1 pack finished in about 8 hours every 4 days or so). This last argument was the big one. It's clear that if I smoke again, this relationship will end.

I'm at 4 days, 19 hours, 16 minutes at the moment. I'm fine during the day and as long as I'm busy and around people. When I'm home alone though, I don't know what to do with myself and end up moping around about how I can't smoke any more. I've read Alan Carr's book, but it didn't really sink in (I read it pretty slowly and finished it in August). I know in 2 weeks my boyfriend is leaving for a month and I won't have him here to "catch" me.  This confuses me though, because I know I can make it those couple weeks without smoking and I know I don't want to be a smoker forever so now would be the perfect time right?

Whenever I tell myself "never again" I panic tell myself I'm not ready. I think every other time I've quit I knew it was a halfhearted attempt and I would smoke again eventually, so going a couple days/weeks didn't bother me much. Even now, I don't think I've fully committed to the decision so I'm doing okay.

My question to all of you is this: How did you know it was time to give up forever?

2 Days - Trying Hard

Hi All,

It's my second day and I'm really hoping to actually stick to it this time, got the app and everything. I've been addicted since my freshman year of college to nicotine from both cigarettes and the juul. I've smoked weed since high school. I've had both of these addictions until now my junior year of college. I'm at home right now for winter break and am trying to kick both habits. I'm gonna skateboard and lift weights until I go back to school, hopefully by that point all of the cravings and headaches have passed. Anyways, wanted to post to make this a little more real. Been lurking for a while, you are all an inspiration.

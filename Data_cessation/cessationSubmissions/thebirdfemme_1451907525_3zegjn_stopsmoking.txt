Almost at a year but really down in the dumps

I'm so close to a year i can almost taste it. But I've had a shit couple days. Off work so I've been drinking a lot, which usually ends in me getting super depressed. Me being depressed causes me to want to smoke because I have nothing else. I don't want to talk to anyone in real life because it's embarrassing so here i am trying to not fuck up what has been almost a year. 

Going back to work will help even though I hate it haha.

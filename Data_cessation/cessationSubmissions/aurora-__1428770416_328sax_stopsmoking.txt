Chantix / Champix success stories?

Has anyone had success using Chantix? (aka Champix)

My doctor and I are meeting this week to discuss the pros / cons of this drug. I've searched the sub and seen some pretty scary stuff, but I've had some crazy drugs in my system before (Accutane, if you've heard of it) and I made it out okay. I truly believe it's worth a shot since my previous attempts have failed.

Have any of you glorious quitters had success using it?

I am affraid.

Hey there. A few years back I promised my girlfriend that if she would ever get pregnant i would quit smoking before that child was born. Whenever she asked "when will you quit?" i always answered "oh dont worry babe, i will when we have a baby for sure". Well she is now my wife (got lucky) and she is 19 weeks pregnant. Now i have been preparing myself for this, and over the years it definitely dawned on me that i need to quit this, not for any one else, but for me. Obviously i know how awful it is, and i am ready to quit. What frightens me the most is how i will handle my ager and temper, since that always has been a problem for me. Is it really magnified? Is it something i should legitimately be concerned about? What can i do to help this? Thanks and sorry for the long read.

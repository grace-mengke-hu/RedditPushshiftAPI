A quick tip to quit and stay smoke-free

Just wanted to share what it really help my case.
I've been a smoker for 17 years and I quit cold turkey, to avoid the cravings I start vaping in those moments when I used to smoke, like after a meal or before bed.

I would say that vaping has help a lot in those circumstances but what I think was even more helpful was telling myself that I wasn't quitting, that I was just not smoking a cigarette today.

So then I kept telling myself, that I will smoke whenever I go out and have some drinks.

Don't ever say never, I makes it look so hard, just don't smoke one day, and the next day tell yourself the same, use some excuse to trick your brain, like I did with the nights out.

Just to finish. it happens that I went out probably 2 weeks after I stop smoking and I just told myself " it's not worth it all the effort for just one cigarrete" so I refuse it and I haven't smoke a single one.

"Im not smoking today"

Need some courage.

I've been smoking regularly for a year now, i know its nothing compared to the people here, but lately i've been realizing how much money i waste on having pack a day and how much more money i'll waste if i keep smoking, i was thinking, hey how about i stop now. The thing that holds me back is i see all these posts "smoking for 15 years, now im free", and it gives me this feeling like "they've had their "pleasure" for 15 years and managed to quit, and i see people irl that have been smoking for a long time and also did quit, so maybe i can smoke for a month or two, or a year, and quit too. I know my logic has flaws, i obviously do, but its just stronger than me, i always think about it, and then buy a pack anyway and say, naah, this is DEFINETELY the last one. Before every pack i say its my last one. I dont know. I even lost myself typing this, just wanted to put out my feelings and thoughts here.

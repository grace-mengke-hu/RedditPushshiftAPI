I relapsed...

After a 86 day streak I gave in to the urges. Today I felt a shit ton of urges hit me all at once, coupled with me not having internet in my new apartment I went outside for a walk in the park. Having just refilled an old zippo I found I decided to play with it and had this urge to smoke. I spent the whole day walking around looking for half smoked cigs on the ground until I finally found a menthol and smoked it. I felt good and bad at the same time. I immidiatly felt pain in my body, but my anxiety fell and I had that nicotine high I hadn't felt for so long. I'm not sure if i'm going to quit anytime soon considering high school is starting back up and at least here in France it's very important for making friends with the cool kids.

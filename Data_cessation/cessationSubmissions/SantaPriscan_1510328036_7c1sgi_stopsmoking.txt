21.5 hours without a cigarette.

I have 6 more days of PTO. Tired of feeling exhausted and stressed all the time. Tired of the money wasted and dealing with freeloaders on the street. Tired of the image (will be looking at /r/trashy for motivation).

Plan on staying in my apartment and just waiting it out with video games and pushups. Have no additional stressors. This feels like its going to go further than my previous attempts. I have tried about 5 times to quit and haven't made it past the 3 day mark.

Going to boot camp in a few months so I have to quit one way or another. This is no longer an issue of want it is an issue of need.

Day 2 Update: I have 7 hours left until I have hit the 48 hour mark. Feeling tired more than anything, which is fine since I have time and have anticipated this. Will probably eat some pizza and play some Xbox then sleep through it some more. I will probably provide an update for each day until I hit a week free.

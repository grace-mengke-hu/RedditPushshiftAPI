Finally ready to break the addiction. Need advice.

So I haven't had many side effects from nicotine until recent. 
Back story.. The beginning of July i got a nasty upper respiratory infection and sore throat lasting 2 weeks. My throat was too sore to vape, so I only hit my device when truly necessary. As soon as my sore throat went away, I picked back up like before my illness. Now I'm dealing with terrible anxiety to the point where I can hardly catch my breath when the nicotine is in my body. This anxiety is exhausting me. I've tried not smoking any, but then I get very irritable, grumpy towards my family and friends, and very stressed over the smallest thing. To curb this, I hit my device and was immediately thrown back into shortness of breath/anxiety. I'm not trying to choose between the lesser of two evils like I have this past week.
Please share with me what has helped you quit nicotine entirely.

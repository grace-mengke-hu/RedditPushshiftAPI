Quit for 2.5 years... Just one did it... STUPID!

We'll here I am... a year back smoking. Last August I went to a taco festival. Ended up drinking way to much tequila and had a few cigs. The next day I bought a pack telling myself "I'll stop after this pack". 

Well here I am almost a year since that day and I'm trying to quit. I can't stop thinking about dying from cancer... Waking up I can't breath, my tongue is dry. Why am I doing this to myself. I'm going to read the easy way again. 

Wish me luck.

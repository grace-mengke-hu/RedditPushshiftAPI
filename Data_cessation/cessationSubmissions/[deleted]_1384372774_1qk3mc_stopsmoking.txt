experience using dip to get off cigarettes?

Have any of you quit smoking through dipping tobacco, and then quitting altogether? I've recently been dipping when I feel the need for a cigarette. I smell better and my lungs are getting better. I know that's it's just switching one vice for the other, but I've had a hard trying to quit cold turkey. So I'm curious if any of you have had success with switching cigarettes for dip, and then being able to quit altogether. Thoughts?

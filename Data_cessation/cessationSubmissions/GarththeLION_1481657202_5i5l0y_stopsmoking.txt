Trying to quit!

I'm new here, like just found you after searching "I want a cigarette so bad right now" into google. So forgive me if I fuck this up or don't do it right, if thats even possible. Anyways not sure what to expect but I'm trying to quit and I could probably use some help, because right now I'm finding it hard to remember why I wanted to quit in the first place.

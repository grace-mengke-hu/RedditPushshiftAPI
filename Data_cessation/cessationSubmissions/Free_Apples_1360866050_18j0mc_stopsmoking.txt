Latching onto/becoming addicted to other (albeit less harmful) substances?

Ever since quitting, I've noticed that I'm starting to latch onto other things. At first it was food (and still is to some extent, though I'm really trying hard to watch what I eat), and now it seems like I need a few cups of coffee every day. Right now I'm fighting the urge to make a pot and I'm even feeling anxious.

I mean, I much rather be addicted to coffee over cigarettes, but I still feel like I'm trapped and controlled by these external substances that dictate my mood and how I feel. Any ideas?

1 week down - insight for others quitting right now

Hey guys, I posted about a week ago with my troubles of quitting cigarettes and how I am finally getting rid of this horrible addiction.

I have made it so far one week without a cigarette after 7 years from late teenage years to mid 20s (pack a day). I feel better, my sense of smell is coming back, I don't feel depressed or anxious as much as I did when I smoked, and I am looking forward to the future.

But, it all came with a horrible cost which was the withdrawals, the mood swings, depression & anxiety (heightened more than usual), no motivation, feeling hazy or having horrible brain fog. I felt crazy without nicotine. This was all most likely due to quitting cold turkey rather than switching for a vape, champix (spelling?), or patches etc.

The first week was the hardest for me. It might be different for others. But if you are currently quitting, or you are planning to quit, know that you are not alone - and that it can be done! 

The motto that got me through it so far, and will continue to in the future is "Short term pain for long term gain."

Thanks guys! This subreddit changed my life.

One month

It has been easy and that isn't a good thing for me.  This is were i have fucked up in the passed.  I think oh its so easy i can just quite again when i want.  Not...  You Can't control drug addiction.  I do get cravings but they are so little.  Its like being thirsty when im already drinking water.  I don't want to forget about smoking and how evil the addiction really is.  Spending over 350 a month.  Going out at odd hours of the night to get a pack in panic cause i ran out.  I feel i have a lot more energy.  I don't have to be worried stricken when im at work.  When can i smoke.  Will i get caught.  Where i work its legal to smoke on the grounds.  Im not risking my job any more.  I can breath easier.  My sleep has been a lil fucked up but it always is but maybe a lil more.  I think my sense of smell is improving.  I smoked for 10 years.  Pack a day.  
    Not my first time stopping.  Last summer i started back up again.  It was on a camping trip and i though i could just have one.  That didn't hold.  Now all most 8 months later im stopping again.  Im going for it to be my last.  Only thing that i see that might make me smoke a again is going on camping trips.  A family death or a fuck it moment because im depressed.  Good luck everyone on stopping and don't stop trying to stop.

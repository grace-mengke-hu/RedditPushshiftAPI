7 weeks down!

I quit on Thanksgiving; I knew I would have to be around my parents all day and did not want the smell to be in my hair, fingernails, clothes, damn everything. When I flew back home, I just never bought a new pack and haven't looked back. I'm not sure if the cravings will ever stop, but my chest feels so much better. Stay strong everyone!

Three years of trying and I finally did it!!!!

I was a passionate smoker for more than 9 years. Last few years I started to think about quitting but I couln't imagine smoke never again. So I didn't quit. Meanwhile, I started to cough and it was getting worse. 
Cigarettes became just an expensive habbit.
Last monday I got up in the morning thinking about my health, the color of my teeth and the smell I could rid off and Told myself: "today is the day!"
Last few days I feel much better: I'm calm, sadisfied, sleep better, have more energy. Now It's hard to imagine to smoke never again, but then I remember my father quitting over night after 30 years ('cause my mom got sick being a passive smoker) and I know I can do it, too. It's all in my head. Wish me luck! :)

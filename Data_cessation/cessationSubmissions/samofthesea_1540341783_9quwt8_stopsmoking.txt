Calorie counting/weight loss &amp; quitting?

I’ve seen multiple people post about using their quitting as a catalyst for overall better health. While I generally eat pretty decent and am somewhat active, I used to be a runner and workout a lot more. I’d like to lose about 40 pounds, but am trying to focus on one goal right now (I’m on day 8 and feeling amazing, like this is the I will stick with it) 

My question is...did you wait a certain amount of time until you felt completely confident in your quit to bring calorie counting into it? Advice/thoughts?

Thanks for the support

I'm a couple weeks down, and I just want to thank everyone for their posts on here. I swing by every couple days, and seeing the successes, as well as the failures motivate me to keep going. Besides being hypnotized, the biggest help for me has been to remind myself that "One is too many, and a million isn't enough."

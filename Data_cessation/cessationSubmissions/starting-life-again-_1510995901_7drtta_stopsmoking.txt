Between Circle and Star

So I was thinking of making a milestone post for my one month when I will get my fancy new star. Although I realized, that the 4 week badge is the one you spend the least amount of time with so I'll acknowledge this one instead. 

Things have gotten better in the last 4 weeks. I feel I have more breath, more energy and after peaking last week, the cravings have gone down. I've quit before for a year and this time around seems to be more difficult. Still, I don't miss it at all and will continue not smoking. Thanks to everyone on this sub for their support and all the best on your respective journeys.

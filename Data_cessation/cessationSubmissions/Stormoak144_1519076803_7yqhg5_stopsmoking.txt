I think I want to quit.

I don't want to be a smoker. I want to not be smoking. At the same time I don't want to quit, I want to have already quit. I can make it 24 hours without a cigarette but then I keep caving. I want to make it 2 days. I want to want to quit. I feel like I have no will power and I don't like that.

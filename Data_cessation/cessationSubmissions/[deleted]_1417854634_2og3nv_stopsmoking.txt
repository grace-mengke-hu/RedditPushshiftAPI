I want to start quitting but i feel like i am being held back

I just subscribed to this sub. Some of the shit i read here so far really motivates me to quit but i dont know if i am ready to do so.

I am 22 and ive been smoking for about 4 years. I started kinda casual but it didnt take long for me to get to a pack a day. The only time i ever "quit" was not even by choice. I was hospitalized in a psych ward and they didnt give me privelages for about a week and i went insane. I was literally walking back and forth in my room pretending to smoke a cigarette and inhaling air as hard as i could just wishing i was actually holding and smoking a cig. That was almost 3 years ago and i never tried quitting since. And like i said that situation isnt even quitting because as soon as i was allowed to walk around the hospital i bolted to the nearest gas station in the freezing cold weather and bought myself a pack. 

I know i should quit and a huge part of me wants to but there is still that part of me that loves smoking. Im not gonna go into what i like about it cause i dont wanna give you unnecessary cravings (sorry if i already did).

The funniest part about it is that i was always scared of anything happening to me when it comes to my health. Im scared of going to the bathroom one day and start pissing blood yet i continue to smoke.

What im trying to say is that i need some more motivation. I dont wanna try quitting if i know im gonna fail. I feel like im stuck.

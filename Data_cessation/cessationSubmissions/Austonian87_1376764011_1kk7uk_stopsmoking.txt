Day Number Six and I'm Not Looking Back

 It has been six days since my last cigarette. I can't say that it has been easy because it hasn't. I can say it has been easier than my last few attempts. The patch has helped me tremendously. I don't even feel like I need a cigarette any more and eventually I won't need the patch.

I am proud of myself. Something I haven't allowed myself to feel in a very, very long time. This task that before seemed so daunting, unattainable, and distant seems closer every day. A life without cigarettes before seemed impossible. I was chained to the tobbacco industry for the rest of my life it seemed, but now there is light at the end of the tunnel. Faint and distant still, but light all the same. I am no longer staring into the dark, black abyss that is addiction with no sign of hope, no sign of relief.

Now I have more energy than I even remember having. I can smell things again. I can breathe. I wake up in the morning and I don't have to add five minutes to my morning routine for that morning cigarette. I don't smoke one on the way to work. I don't smoke. I feel like I can take on the world. I am not foolish. I know tough times are ahead. I know difficulties will arise and I will need help facing them without smoking. I am not out of the woods yet, but I have found a path and I am following it. With help and support from my friends, you, and my family this goal can be reached.

For lack of a better word, I relapsed. Back to day one.

I made the decision to quit cold turkey and caved after not smoking for 18 hours. I regret it but I'm trying not to beat myself up over it. 
However, cigarettes are starting to lose their appeal more and more. The nicotine itself is all that's tricking me into smoking. 

And for anyone else in the early stages of stopping; don't do what I did. 
Tonight I'm going to sleep. When I wake up I won't smoke. I think if I can get through the first 2 days, the world is my oyster. Wish me luck.

Six months and a thank you!

Hi everyone!

I'm almost at seven months now. It's been a great seven months and I don't ever regret my decision to quit smoking. I'm less anxious, less stressed out, have more free time (it's crazy to think how much of my time I used to dedicate to smoking), I've been able to overcome my fears a lot easier. I can breathe better, I smell better. I feel great. I'm less tired. I have more money to spend on myself and loved ones.

I still get cravings. This past month has been particularly bad for some reason. I just think it has to do with typical Holiday stress and the fact that I've been working way more overtime than normal. Haven't caved yet, though! It's just surprising to hear "I really need a cigarette..." in the back of my head. I even said it out loud to my brother the other day without even thinking about it. I don't need one ever again! It'll pass.

This sub has been a very good motivator and I wanted to say thank you to all of you. I enjoy reading the posts here and contribute when I feel I have something meaningful to say. For those of you who are either in the process of quitting or are making it their New Years resolution to quit, I say way to go! It will suck for a bit, but things get awesome really, really fast.

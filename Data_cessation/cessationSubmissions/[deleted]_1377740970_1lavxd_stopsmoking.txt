YEAH! I cracked, had a smoke for the first time in 3 weeks, and found it disgusting!

So, I'd been smoking heavily for about a year and a half, and a lightly before that, until a friend of mine who works at a gas station hooked up some disposable e-cigs. I was like yeah whatever,  I'll try them but I'll just go back to smoking. So I went a week, and hey, I was happy with the ecigs. I had a pretty stressful day today, and I'm out of ecigs so I pulled out my emergency pack. I light the smoke, take a couple drags, and I realize wow, these taste like shit. Threw it away, threw the pack in the garbage, and went to the gym. I'll try going without the ecigs now, and I'll be done with it. Hopefully one more bad habit I can cross off my list for good. Sure I haven't been smoking as long as a lot of other people, but it's definitely possible for everyone else to quit, just keep at it! I've lost 22 pounds, mostly stopped drinking sodas, and I'm feeling the best I ever have.

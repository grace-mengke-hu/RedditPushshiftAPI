1 month down. Y'all are just making this into a big deal.

I found this sub the other day and I've noticed some of you guys are treating this shit like it's a bigger deal than it is. It honestly sucks bad for 2 WEEKS. And it's way easier than your mum or family member dying. Man the fuck up, and just do it. It's not gonna be easy. If it was easy nobody would smoke. You're seriously just a bitch if you can't do it. Cut the people who smoke out of your life, and pick up a hobby. That's actually all it takes. Shits nasty dude. When you treat it like the biggest deal of your life, it's obviously gonna be. Downvote me all you want, but y'all are a bunch of pussies for crying over fucken cigarettes.

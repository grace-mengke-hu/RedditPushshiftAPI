This is the sixth day without a cigarette.

I stopped smoking since Sunday and since Monday iam feeling sick. Im feeling like having a cold all the time, plus kind of a bit of a depression.
Do you guys expierienced the same or is this just a coincidence that i got sick the same time i stopped smokin?

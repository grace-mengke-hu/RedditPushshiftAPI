A minor hiccup and a major challenge.

I've been a smoker since I was 17 (7 years) and quit cold turkey last September. I enjoyed 5 straight months of minimal cravings and strong willpower without cigarettes, even though the majority of my friends are smokers still.
Last week my ex gf "stumbled upon" my reddit screen name to stir me up (it worked) and I voluntarily caved in big time to the stress. I feel like I might have lost the little progress I made, but am still determined to quit for my original reasons, and not simply give up because of one trite encounter. Now my cravings are intense and numerous again.
I have even set up a reward/punishment system in the short run concerning the last pack of cigarettes I bought. My friends have volunteered to adjudicate and ensure that I comply with the rules. If I break again and smoke, I will have to eat that empty box of Camel Filters. If I succeed, that box can sit there for years as a reminder. I really don't want to eat the box.

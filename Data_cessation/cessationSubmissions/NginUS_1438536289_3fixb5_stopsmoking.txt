On Day 3 without smoking, & I want to dig my smokes out of the trash & have one

Hi,

As part of my daily routine, I (kindof) meditate & think about what my Higher Power's will for me is, & I pray every day that I do his will. Thus, it's become clear that smoking's not in god's plan for me, & that I ought to quit. So I did quit at first, then after a day I had another smoke, then I quit again- only to have a smoke a day later. Now 3 days ago, I quit yet again, and haven't given in to the cravings yet for 3 days.

I wish I would get a sign from god that I could smoke just one more- out of those that are in the trash. But I don't think that's going to happen.

So I'm struggling with quitting Cold Turkey- and after 3 days the cravings are still something to battle. I've been going to bed early with the help of sleeping pills, so I don't have to feel the cravings while I'm asleep. But I've been taking more than my prescribed dose of them just so I can put myself to sleep when I'm nowhere near tired yet. So that won't be available to me after tonight. I'll have to stay up & suffer through the cravings tomorrow night. Not looking forward to it.

I could use some help to keep fighting the good fight here. I know I only _think_ I want a cigarette.

-Thanks,
N

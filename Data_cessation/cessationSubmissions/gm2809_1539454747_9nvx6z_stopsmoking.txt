Day 19- No smoking

I never thought I could have gone without smoking even for a day. Smoked for 11 yrs... pack a day and quit cold turkey
Yesterday night funny thing happened... was walking down an empty street and i saw cigarette lying on pathway 3/4 left and still burning... my mind was just pondering should i just cheat and take a puff and even before i could decide my foot automatically just crushed it..... I felt so great... it was like a victory 

Hope it stays like this and hope i never pick up this habit again

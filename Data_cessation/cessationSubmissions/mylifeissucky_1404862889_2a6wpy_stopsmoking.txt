What I think nicotine really does...

Nicotine works with dopamine for what I know, but the brain on nicotine says to smoke more, thinking it is receiving pleasure, when you could be in pain from a bad cough or something like this. 

 I have learned to discern a nicotine brain talking separate from the real me talking.

If there is an excuse trying to get me to smoke floating around, I just know it is the nicotine talking. I know now that it wouldn't be me saying those excuses. I just tell the excuse that floats by to go away and then I can be clear again. If it is a trigger, this is then the nicotine trying to talk to me too.

I don't really think about smoking anymore!

Hello /r/stopsmoking!

I just wanted to tell you guys that it really gets easier! I smoked a pack a day for 5 years and thought I would be a smoker for the rest of my life. I quit 143 days ago today and honestly the thought about smoking seems so alien to me now. I thought I would lose the social part of smoking but instead i gained an option. The option to join them if I feel like it (without smoking), not because I need a smoke!

Stay strong guys, even if you don't believe in yourself yet, I do!

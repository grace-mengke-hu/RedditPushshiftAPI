Day 1.

22 years of smoking, and I've got Wellbutrin and a patch.  This morning went really well, I even had a nicotine buzz from the patch.  Around 3:30, though, the cravings hit and they haven't gone away.  It's been almost 3 hours.  I've chewed gum, drank water, and eaten both dinner and cake.  (It's my daughter's 2nd birthday, and this is my biggest gift to both of us).  

I know my body is getting the nicotine it needs from the patch...but this habit is awful to break.  

I need help.

I feel like a complete failure...

I've been smoking for 15 years. I'm a mechanic and an avid rock climber. I started working on cars around the same time as I started smoking so they have always been linked in my mind. I would like to start a new career but that isn't feasible for me at the moment. It's so hard to say no when I'm working on cars... my rock climbing progress has hit a wall and I'm fairly certain it primarily has to do with the cigarettes. I don't feel like I can do this. I was able to go 6 days without but the cravings became very intense last night and combined with some very real stress caused me to cave. I have a race car that I'm trying to finish up but I can't concentrate because of the cravings. Is it so bad to just smoke while I'm finishing this car and then try again after its completed? I feel like my girlfriend doesn't really understand the difficulty as she has only really been a smoker for a couple months. 

Sorry for the rant. I guess I'm just trying to reach out for some support from people who understand what I'm going through a little better. Any suggestions/help would be greatly appreciated.

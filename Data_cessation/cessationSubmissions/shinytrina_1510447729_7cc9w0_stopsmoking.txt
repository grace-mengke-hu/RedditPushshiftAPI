Update on my quitters cold

A few days ago I posted about what I thought was quitters flu, woke up with a sore throat, headache etc.  Went through Thursday with a slightly sore throat but kept well hydrated with water and tea and seemed to be good to go.

Friday morning was a bit more rough and in the afternoon I took a nap and that is when it happened.  Full blown laryngitis.  Totally can't talk now.  Had a weird dream that I started smoking menthol cigarettes to help.  My awake and logical brain knows better.

Fingers cross this will pass soon enough

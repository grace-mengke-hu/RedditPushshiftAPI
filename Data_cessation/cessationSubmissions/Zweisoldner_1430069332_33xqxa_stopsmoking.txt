Day 7: "Hey bro you want one?"

Just finished the last economics exam of my BA. A few friends that I've met over the years (over smoking admittedly) came out for a cigarette. I was thinking of just walking away, but considering we had literally just finished our degrees, it seemed pretty rude.

I was offered a cigarette as usual, I politely refused, and just stood there chatting while they were puffing away. We hung out for a little longer and said our goodbyes. Surprisingly they didn't say anything about me not having a cigarette with them. 

Hopefully I have the willpower to last through the day. I still have an exam at 7 for an elective but after that, it'll mark the official end of this degree. I kind of want to have one as to celebrate the occasion, but at the same time, not having a one seems equally rewarding.

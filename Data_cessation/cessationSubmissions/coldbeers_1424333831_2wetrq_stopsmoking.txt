12 Years

Bless you Allen Carr, I can never thank you enough...

For anyone who hasn't tried AC's book or video give it a try, I don't represent them and don't care if you download it for free, I'm sure AC wouldn't either by now. The important thing is to give it a try.

I never believed in self help BS and still don't but this was the most life changing thing I ever bought. I had been a pack-a-day+ guy for 20 years before that and had failed to stop many times

For the record in the last 12 years I have been around smokers, drank beer, ate, been stressed, got married, been laid off/changed jobs, lost a parent, emigrated around the world etc etc and have never been seriously tempted to smoke, although I still dream I relapsed (nightmare).

Of course I know I'll never smoke again, in fact if someone told me the world would end next week and offered me a cigarette I wouldn't waste my time smoking it. 

Good luck to all on the journey, however you do it trust me, life is better without being addicted to a pointless, expensive, dangerous drug, it really does nothing good for you.

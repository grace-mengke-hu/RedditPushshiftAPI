Few questions i have

I'm 27 years old, i have just started to quit smoking (2 days and counting) Was a 10-15 a day man. My main reason is the visual effects its starting to have on my face. I get puffy eyes and just generally don't have that natural glow or whatever anymore. I believe this comes from the nicotine in cigarettes, so would using a patch containing nicotine effectively make no difference in changing the way my skin looks? Also has anybody got any advice for products which would help my skin from my past smoking?

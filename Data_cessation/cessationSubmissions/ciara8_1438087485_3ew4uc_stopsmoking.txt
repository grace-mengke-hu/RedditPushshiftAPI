Cigarette cravings are created by the previous cigarette you have smoked, not by not having smoked for a long time! And how I relapsed after almost 2 years..

Hi everyone, 

In 2013 I quit cold turkey and unfortunately relapsed a few months ago, after almost two years of being a non-smoker. How? I was drunk one night, a friend had brought those 'awesome' cuban cigars and said here try them. Without even realizing what I am doing I took a puff. That was all it took, a day or two later I had bought a pack. 

Before that relapse I was a happy non-smoker. For the last four or so months of my 'quit' I realized I hadn't even had one thought of a cigarette, I had completely forgotten about them. Before that, maybe once a month the thought vaguely occurred while drinking coffee that it would be kinda nice to light up, but nothing more.

However, the puff I took was enough to 're-light' all those nicotine receptors and cause cravings latter. 

I am now quitting again and am realizing that this is the most important thing to realize, as obvious and dumb as it may sound:

THE FEELING OF WANTING TO SMOKE IS CAUSED BY THAT LAST PUFF OF THE PREVIOUS CIGARETTE THAT YOU SMOKED, NOT BY NOT HAVING SMOKED FOR A WHILE. 

Give it long enough and the physical cravings that your last cigarette is causing will go away. Than all that is left is understanding that the pleasure derived from smoking is an illusion, anyone who reads the popular Alan Carr book knows this already.

Time after last cigarette + removing any mental delusions that smoking feels good = success

Careful though, one puff is all it will take and you'll be a smoker again, for months or years. Just one puff is not just one puff, it's like 300 packs that follow after it.

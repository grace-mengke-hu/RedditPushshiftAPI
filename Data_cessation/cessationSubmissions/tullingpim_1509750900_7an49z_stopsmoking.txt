Cheers to all who are succeeding.

This is the hardest thing I've ever done in my life. Smoked at least a pack a day for the last 10 years and had my last one Monday morning. After a stressful 10 hours at work I got off the train today and walked into the store I always buy my smokes at and i held strong and just bought beer (no way I can give that up too). I'm not proud of myself though, I feel no joy, only anger and a desire to go back and get a pack. I'm flying off the handle at the stupidest shit, for instance I almost flipped when my girl told me she's making mashed potatoes instead of roasted. I realize how stupid I am being, how trivial these things are, but cigarettes have always been a huge part of my life. I've paired them with everything I do. I honestly love them. The feel the smell the taste, there's a reason I once went a year smoking 2 packs a day. This post makes no sense at all, but basically to anyone who's successfully quit I applaud you whole heartedly. This is fucking brutal. I might buy a pack and give to my girlfriend to be the gatekeeper, but I know come Monday morning I'm just gonna buy a pack at work. Fuck how does anyone do this?

Afraid to Quit

This has taken a lot of courage to post. I know I need to quit and I know that in the long run it will make me feel better, but even the thought of it makes me feel horrible. I have a lot of anxiety and pressures in my life and I know that I use smoking to help deal with them, but I do not think I could do anything without smoking. I have quit once before for a few months, but fell back into old habits. I am so embarrassed I smoke, but before I started smoking I had no friends and could not handle the amount of stress in my life. Now, it's almost as if I am so conditioned that I don't know how to even go for a drive without smoking. I want to quit, but I am afraid of who I am without cigarettes and who in my life I'll push away quitting. If you have any words of advice PLEASE share them!

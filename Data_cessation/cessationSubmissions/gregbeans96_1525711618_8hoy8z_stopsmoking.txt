Over a year has passed, still have cravings when stresssed

Is this gonna stick with me my whole life? It's been a year since I've had any nicotine except for the small amounts is certain foods.

I'm not mentally weak enough to go buy a pack, but I can feel the feeling it would give me if I did.

I'm not going to.

Do any of you get this?  How long does it last?

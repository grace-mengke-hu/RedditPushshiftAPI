5 days into quitting and the cravings are killing me

I'm going cold turkey after 2 years of almost a pack a day. This time I'm in it for real. but today has been REALLY rough. I've spent the last 30 min emptying all of my bags &amp; pockets in search for a half-smoked cig I could smoke right now...  (thankfully) I didn't find one, but I honestly don't remember how to focus on reading for school without a cigarette in my hand :(

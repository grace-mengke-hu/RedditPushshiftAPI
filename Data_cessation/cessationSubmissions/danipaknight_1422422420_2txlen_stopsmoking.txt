Advice on "just cutting back" (pack a day 7-8 years)

Is it possible? My live-in SO isn't quitting, nor is our roommate, we continue to frequent the neighborhood smoking bar, I don't have health issues, yet. But I defiantly feel that cigarettes are too large an element of my life. Should I just quit? Is there a way to just smoke when drinking (3 days a week) and not fall into the pack a day cycle?

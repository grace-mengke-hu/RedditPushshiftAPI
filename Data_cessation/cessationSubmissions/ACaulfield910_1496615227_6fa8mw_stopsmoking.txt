I think the hardest part of quitting is the fact that we still have the option

I feel like if we were isolated somewhere with no chance of acquiring cigarettes whatsoever, quitting would almost be natural because there's really nothing we can do. But what makes it worse, at least for me, is that I have the option to walk down the block at any second and buy a pack. I have the option to go out and bum a smoke from any random person. I have to control myself not to do it, and that's the hardest part.

Just played my first football match after JUST 7 days of stopping smoking.

I cried! Literally i cried. With happiness i never thought i could get in the field again. I used to walk a bit and get out of breath but i went there and played a while match without being short of breathe i am so. So happy i done this. I feel like a new person 

I actually had a dream that i was about to smoke then said ‘nah i do t want to throw mt new life away’ and didn’t!

You guys, this is the best decision I’ve ever made!

Success with patches?

I was wonder what people's thoughts / experiences are on patches? 

They work quite well for me, I don't get nicotine cravings, just oral fixation / feel the need to put something in my mouth.

The only problem I've had is being addicted to the patches, and if I drink alcohol I rip the patch off and have a smoke. Goes to show how dumb drinking makes you.

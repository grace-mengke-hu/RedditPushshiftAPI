What are your thoughts on help remedies

So im 27 years old been smoking since i was 14 year old, i have seen to many in my family die because of lung cancer due to smoking. The other day i went down to the pharmacy and bought step 1 Nicotin patches, im on my 5'th day now and im going strong, but i cant help to feel that im cheating yes im not smoking but still im getting nicotin. i dont know if i should keep going or also stop using the patches. What are your thoughts?

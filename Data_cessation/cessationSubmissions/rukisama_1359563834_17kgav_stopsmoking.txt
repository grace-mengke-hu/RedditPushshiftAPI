First day, looking for tips

Hi, I decided the other day that I really want to quit smoking. It's affected my health so much, I just can't take it anymore.
I've been smoking for 9 years (God, has it been that long?), about a pack a day.
I've tried quitting before but I've always gone back to old habits. I'd like to make this the time I really quit for good. 
I'm so glad this community exists, I'm sure it'll be a big help! Does anybody have any tips on what to do the first few days? I'm quitting cold turkey.

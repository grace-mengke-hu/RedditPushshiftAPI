Day 7 without smoking

My dad was a smoker all his life until he died of cancer (ironically not lung/mouth related) and I've been smoking on and off since I was about 12 (especially in periods of stress) but last Thursday I had an epiphany: I was slowly killing myself, and paying large amounts of money to do it. I'm a scientist so I always knew how bad cigarettes were, but the psychological relief they provided was what I needed. It's been a tough week since I went cold turkey (I've had cravings so often) but it's getting better everyday. Also, the same day I quit smoking I also quit drinking (was quite a heavy drinker) so I have double the cravings...but I'll power through. I'm determined to change my life for the better. Wish me luck.

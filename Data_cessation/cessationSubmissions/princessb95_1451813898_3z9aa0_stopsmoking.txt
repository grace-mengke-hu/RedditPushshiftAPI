Advice on talking to my Dad about him smoking

Hello Reddit,  well it's three in the morning and I can't sleep because I'm extremely concerned for my Father's health. My Dad has probably been smoking since before I was born (so over 20 years). He managed to quit once, years ago, for a few months because he kept feeling a pain in his arm and his doctor told him how smoking could lead to a heart attack. I've always felt uncomfortable with him smoking, but since my mother has asthma he doesn't really smoke inside our house or in the car so I don't really see him do it often.
Today he woke up unable to breathe around midnight. My mom and I tried to get him to at least cough by pounding on his back and such. He was able to and fell right back to sleep. According to my mom, this isn't the first time this has happened. I doubt this has anything to do with him smoking, but it did make me start thinking about all of the things smoking could be doing to him. 
A lot of family members on his side have had cancer, and I really don't want my dad to be the next one especially if it's caused by something preventable like smoking. I want him to be around for a long time, but I'm scared that his smoking habits are cutting that time. He hates doctors so God only knows what kind of shape his health is in. 
I understand that it's ultimately his decision to quit and that it is a hard addiction to break, but I would like to open some sort of conversation with him on the subject. I'm just worried that he will dismiss anything I have to say by just telling me that I'm worrying too much or something.

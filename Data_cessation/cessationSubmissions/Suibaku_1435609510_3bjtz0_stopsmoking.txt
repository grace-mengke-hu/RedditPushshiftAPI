Day 1!

So, i decided to go cold turkey today. It was going good until near the end of my shift, where i was informed by my brother that my great-grandma passed away 2 weeks ago. After i returned home, i was sure i was going to cave from the grief. But i stood strong! I did not back down. If i can get through her funeral without smoking i'm sure i can quit for good. 

Thank's for reading my little rant, i needed to vent.

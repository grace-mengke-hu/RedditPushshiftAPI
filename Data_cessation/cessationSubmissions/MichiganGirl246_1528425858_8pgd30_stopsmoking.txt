4 days, 4 hours smoke free. Struggling a bit right now and need support.

I feel like the thrill of quitting is kind of starting to fade and I’m starting to really miss smoking. The stress relief, the moment of quiet summer air... I know it’s crazy that I’m romanticizing it but that’s why I’m asking for help.

Trying to quit

I havent exactly quit yet, but I feel like if I put my intentions to quit in writing it will help. I've cut back significantly so far. I used to smoke a pack a day at least. Now I only smoke at work, which is a casino. So I'm constantly surrounded by smoke, which does not help cravings. I just bum off of other people now and havent bought a pack in about a month. Gum has helped a ton. On my days off I barely think about smoking and I only need to have a few pieces of gum a day now. Just thought I'd share my slight progress, if its considered that. Tips on quitting and subbing to this subreddit should help me get the rest of the way to being an ex-smoker.

My First Successful Attempt (so far)!

I've made it 8 days so far without smoking! No, it hasn't just been 8 days since I reset the badge, smoked again, and I just haven't reset it quite yet like all the other times. My first full week (+1 day) where I really didn't smoke in over a year, maybe two. I don't even know why I was able to quit this time, because the only thing I'm doing differently is... well, not smoking. It just clicked one day and I tore up my last 2 cigs, finished the one I had lit, and went on from there. Once all this bullshit chest tightness and coughing clears up, I think I'll be all good. I have a good feeling about it this time.

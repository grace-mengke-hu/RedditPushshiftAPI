Temptations around other smokers..

This weekend I'll be at a cabin on a lake and everyone I'm staying with smokes cigarettes. Normally I'd join them and this is where I'd become a heavy smoker and just smoke like a damn chimney. 

This is actually part of the reason I quit. I was at this place on memorial day and had enough and decided to quit on the drive back home. 

I'm wondering how I should go about not smoking? I'm afraid my self control may lapse because I'll be fairly intoxicated. I also quit nicotine cold turkey and haven't touched it since, otherwise I'd just use a vape.

TIA

I can sing again!

Not very well, but at least I can! Before whenever I sang I would cough horribly and couldn't hit certain pitches. It would hurt my throat and I'd run out of breath fast so I couldn't sing certain songs as well. It really killed my mood because I absolutely love singing even though I'm horrible at it. 

I'm going on two weeks of not smoking and on my way home from work today I sang in my car and I didn't cough or anything! I know it's a little thing, but it put me in a good mood.

3 weeks without smoking but going through break up and I feel like one

I read Allen Carr's Easy way to stop smoking book
But for some reason, going through a break up right now and bad fight. I want to smoke so bad.

And the thing is, a week ago the same thing happened but I didn't cave in I just felt like I was going insane.

I don't know what to do. I have rolled one and I want to light it. I need help.

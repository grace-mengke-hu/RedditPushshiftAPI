Day One...

So my journey begins today, I have been smoking for 6 years but I am not quite addicted. I just smoke when I drink, but i want to quit it because in the last months my smoking has increased a lot. I bought an electronic cigarette for when going out drinking. Came to this subreddit for support and tips. I am glad to enter this awesome community.

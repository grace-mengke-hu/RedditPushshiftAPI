Advice after relapse

Okay so I’ve relapsed this evening after over 100 hours cold turkey.

What, from your experience, would be the best thing to do?

Throw the packet away and stop again immediately? 

Finish the packet and stop again once they’re gone?

Start smoking again and set a day in the near future to quit again?

I hate them!

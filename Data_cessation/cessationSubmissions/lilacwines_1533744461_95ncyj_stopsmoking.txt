Replacing morning smoke?

I smoked for 3 years and got up to a pack a day for a while. I've been able to cut down to 1-3 cigarettes a day, but right when I wake up I need a cigarette because I got so used to my morning coffee and cigarette. Has anybody had any success in replacing a morning smoke with another activity?

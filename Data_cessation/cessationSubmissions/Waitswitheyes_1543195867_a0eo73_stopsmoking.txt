Day 59 and the depression is kicking my.....

Grrr....I would have hoped this would get better by now...on SSRIs and was long-term before quitting....GP didn't want to increase my meds despite me telling her that what sabotaged previous quits for me was a resurgence in really bad mood symptoms (horrible irritability, anger, depression, hopelessness)....sheld me (after being cold turkey for at least 2 weeks) just to go on patches....

Over it but hanging on ... Can anyone who experiences/experienced something similar tell me when things started to improve for them?

Thanks for letting me vent...

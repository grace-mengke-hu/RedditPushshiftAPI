What did you replace smoking with?

This may seem like a silly question but I know for me, although smoking didn't take up a great deal of my time, stopping has left this intense emptiness. For example, I got so used to smoking while listening to music, that now I feel a crazy urge to light a cigarette when I hear certain songs. I'm wondering if anyone here took up a new hobby or something after they quit? Something which allowed you to maybe shift your focus? 

Personally, I'm into running but am nowhere near the best I can be, so am thinking I'll focus more on that now and use it as an incentive to continue with no smoking. 

Interested in hearing your answers!

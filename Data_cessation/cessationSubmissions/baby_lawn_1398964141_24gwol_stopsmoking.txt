Quitters who used to love to smoke while drinking: How long did you wait to have a drink after quitting?

I know this varies person-by-person but just curious as to how long others have waited until they were able to purely enjoy a drink without hankering for a cigarette. I honestly don't think I've ever had an alcoholic beverage without a cigarette so I'm SUPER wary and deciding not to drink for an indeterminate time.

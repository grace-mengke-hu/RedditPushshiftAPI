A small step.

I've been on this subreddit for quite some time now, but still haven't made any progress in quitting (or cutting back). It's crazy to me the power that stupid cigarettes have over me! I have watched countless friends struggle and fall into the depths of addiction (mainly heroin and pills) and am proud and grateful that I have avoided taking that path. But god damn do cigarettes fuck me up!

I have smoked since I was 15 (24 now). Not just the occasional cigarette since I was 15, but was an avid every day smoker. I wake up and smoke a cigarette within 10 minutes of opening my eyes. I don't even know if I actually crave cigarettes or if I just light one up when I'm bored. I oversmoke and I feel it in my lungs and it makes me feel like shit about myself (physically and mentally). I woke up this morning with one cigarette left in my pack. I held off on smoking for maybe about an hour which is a lot for me. I then hung around the house and ate some food (which is a huge trigger for me). I took my dog for a walk to the bank so I could deposit some money to pay bills. The gas station is just barely out of the way, but I turned left rather than straight and headed towards the bank. I was thinking to myself "just don't buy a pack, you'll be fine" but as I got closer to the bank I felt my brain thinking, "good job! you put off getting cigarettes for 20 minutes, so stop and get a pack on your way home... you deserve it!" I wanted to listen but I knew in my heart that I need to demonstrate some freaking self control if I ever plan on being able to quit. 

SO I WALKED A DIFFERENT ROUTE HOME! Stayed completely away from the gas station :) I know it's little, but for how bad I am with smoking, it's kind of a big deal for me.


I can't over amp myself up too much because I did roll up 2 second generation cigarettes (ew, I know, shut up)... but hey. I didn't buy a pack. One day at a time I guess.

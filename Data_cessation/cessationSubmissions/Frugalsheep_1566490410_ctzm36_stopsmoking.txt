Smoking to vape?

Hey, I was wondering if anyone has quit smoking and instead starting using vapes to ease the process into totally stopping. So far I'm only 5 days in using a vape and no cigarettes and almost instantly I havent coughed up a big jelly phlegm in 3 days on a morning which i usually do. Can you post your own experience with moving onto vaping instead of cigarettes and gradually quitting this way?

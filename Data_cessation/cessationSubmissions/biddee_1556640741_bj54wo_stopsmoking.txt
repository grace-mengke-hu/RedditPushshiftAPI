Day 2 of quitting. Was going to buy a pack of cigs but bought a cinnamon roll instead

I know eating isn't the answer, but rather than spend $7 on a pack of cigs, I spent $5 on a cinnamon roll (not US$ - yes cigs are super cheap here). I'm proud of myself and now I don't have enough cash on me to buy cigarettes. 

Been smoking for 30+ years and have quit up to 3 months a few times before. Never made it past 3 months. This is it.

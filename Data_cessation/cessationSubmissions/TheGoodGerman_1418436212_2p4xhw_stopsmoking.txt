I'll wake up tomorrow as a non-smoker.

Thats it.


I'll quit.


I am 21 now and wasted a lot of my energy with drugs and shit I should have never done.

Why do I even started this shit with 14? Seven years later I smoke a pack a day - minimum.

I suffered from depression since I was 17 and things are finally going my way now.


I quit smoking weed. 

I quit biting my nails.

I started working out twice a week.

I finally eat enough like I should with my size.

Never ever again will I look into the mirror and see an underweight nervous drugabuser.

And **now** I'll quit this nasty habit of smoking cigs.


I don't want to carry this burden with me anymore, waking up like a piece of coughing shit.

I lied to myself for years, but **NEVER. EVER. AGAIN.**

After so many years I finally started to be the human being I've ever wanted to be.


I don't give a fuck anymore and this little bitch inside me won't stand a chance tomorrow.


Smoking gives me the feel of being a really unattractive person and I wan't to ask this lovely girl out in a few months, even if I barely know her.

And even if I get a rejection, I'll know that it wasn't for my bad habits.


Lighting up the last cig now. last. fucking. cigarette.


Never ever again. I'm done.

One year ago I quit smoking inside a mental hospital, 1 week from being discharged. Now I am 1 year tobacco free and better.

  I was randomly commenting on here yesterday and realized it has been 1 year already, since I last smoked tobacco.  I still smoke weed ocasionally but tobacco, never again.  

  I first quit in december 21 2016, my depression hit me in the face with a brick after 6 months and I had to be hospitalized.  I started smoking again the second I woke up in the mental hospital, and smoked for most of the 50 days I spent there. We coudn't have our own fire there so everyone hung at a bamboo construction that had a shared lighter. Before leaving, when I was already a bit better, I decided I would quit right there and added jogging inside the hospital to better deal with the cravings.

  Honestly, sometimes I feel like going back to smoking, but I think I have it ingrained that I honestly better be dead than go back to being controled by that shit. I know it is better to relapse than to die but honestly the only way I can treat this enemy is like it really is, tobacco is the closest to DEATH I have ever been. No.Fucking.Way.

  Not only my depression is better and now after a year but I have also found my own goals to work own. I am writing my own semi-autobiographic novel while working as a translator and I want to buy my own piece of land. Looking back, one of the first pro-life decisions I had was to stop smoking.  I don't know which came first, but knowing I was able to stay 6 months without smoking it, and more importantly, that I even had the guts to quit again after a relapse helped me built the needed strenght to fight my depression

  The fight was hard, is hard. It will never be easy, the only thing that changes is you.  But that has the power to change everything...

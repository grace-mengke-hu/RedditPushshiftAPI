Find The Best Way to Motivate Yourself

I took this [quiz](http://www.surveygizmo.com/s3/1950137/Four-Tendencies-January-2015) today. The result shows that I'm a questioner, someone who needs a justification and needs to prove it to myself that something is beneficial before I am motivated.

Here's the quote from the result:
>According to your answers, your dominant Tendency is Questioner. Questioners question all expectations, and will meet an expectation only if they believe it’s justified, so in effect, they meet only inner expectations. Once Questioners believe that a particular habit is worthwhile, they’ll stick to it—but only if they’re satisfied about the habit’s soundness and usefulness. They resist anything arbitrary or ineffective

It was amazing that it nails how I motivate myself. I have been delaying quitting because the need wasn't apparent or urgent, or I argue that quitting won't be effective because I don't think I'd last quitting. But after convincing myself with the help of this sub, my doctor and most importantly support of my wife I see this happening and pulled the trigger. Now I'm 108 days nicotine free.

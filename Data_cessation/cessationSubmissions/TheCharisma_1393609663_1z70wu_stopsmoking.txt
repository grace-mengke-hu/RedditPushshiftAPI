Need to quit, but do not want too. Please help.

After a couple of months of bleeding out of my rectum, I was informed yesterday that I have morbus chron disease. It is an incurable inflammatory disease of the digestive system, and several changes must be made in my life. Among them quitting smoke (and in my case snus).  I am 25 years old, and must make these changes Pronto to avoid the risk of getting a stoma, which will putt a serious dent in my sex life. The only change I know I will have serious trouble with is my Snus. I would appreciate any advice you can give me reddit. Please help me keep my already shaky sex appeal.

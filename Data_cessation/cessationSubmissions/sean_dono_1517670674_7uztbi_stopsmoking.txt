12 days in and feeling great.

Hey guys, I've been a smoker for 12 years and woke up 12 days ago and decided to go cold turkey. I've made a YouTube video about my experience and the funny side of quitting. Hope it helps anyone out looking to quit. https://youtu.be/WgkHekz3gIE

Let me know what your experience has been with quitting.

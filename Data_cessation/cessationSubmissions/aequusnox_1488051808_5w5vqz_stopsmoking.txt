Looking for additional motivation on this incredibly uncomfortable journey.

Here's the deal.

I began using at 14 and stopped, let's say, "regularly" using at 21. Using is a form of distraction for me. I learned to hide my problems through external influences. I still use; however, it's to a lesser degree. I don't use regularly and I don't rely on the same stuff I did in the past. Stuff I use is 

- Vyvanse. This is medically prescribed by a doctor. I don't have adhd. I use it as a pick-me-up. I can't stop using it. It helps me process daily life, consequently allowing me to express myself better. 

- Alcohol. I don't love alcohol. I do plan to dwindle my usage of it. I don't fear it because I don't have a deep need for it. I drink it right now because it helps distract me from my issues. Once I get a handle on them, I'll reduce my intake to next to zero.

- Marijuana. Same story as the alcohol. 

- I snorted coke a month ago but I've since permanently sworn off hard drugs forever. This is different than what I did at 21. I still woke up mulling over the idea of using again. I'm not anymore. 

I'm 24 now. I went from 130lbs to 214lbs after I quit using. I'm 5'10. I recognize I was too thin to begin with but fucking god did I balloon. Glad to say I'm 145lbs now. Last summer I had a panic attack and smoked a cigarette to help alleviate it. It did. These were Marlboro Reds. I've smoked cigarettes before but this is when I began smoking them daily. Soon after I transitioned to American Spirits. The dark blues are my favorite. They're strong, taste wonderful, and burn long. Smoking was a great excuse to get out of the house. I'm used to burying myself in a hole in my room and smoking solved that. It provided me an immense rush of relief, but a few problems arose. 

- They're expensive as hell. $10.60 for a pack. 

- They were justifying my laziness. Quitting cigarettes will hopefully allow me to take control of my life and better my situation. 

I'm going through withdrawals right now. The last cigarette I had was last night and right now, in the middle of the afternoon, I'm shaking. My body feels hot. My mind is racing. I'm twitching. More than anything I want a cigarette and I'm beginning to doubt whether or not this is worth it. Looking for other people's experienced with quitting. The alcohol and marijuana is only on my palette because I feel it'll help me through my cigarette withdrawals. I have no doubt I'll be able to cast it to the side once I'm more stable.

Want to quit, but hard to believe in myself.

I've decided I want to stop smoking. Right now. It's a powerful feeling and I will am 100% sure I will not smoke a cigarette for the rest of the day starting today. However, I have to wonder about tomorrow and the day after. I'm not worried about withdrawal symptoms as much as losing my will to stop smoking. This is because I've always struggled to be consistent with anything in my life, and I tend to go with the path of least resistance. My question is this: How, as a person who lacks consistency and discipline, can I take a path that requires commitment every day? Sorry in advance that this question is more about myself as a person rather than directly pertaining to quitting.

P.S.: I tried to look up whether or not how long and how much you smoke affects how difficult it is to quit, but could not find anything. Does anybody know about this? It's pretty intuitive that the longer and the more you've smoked, the harder, but I'm still not sure.

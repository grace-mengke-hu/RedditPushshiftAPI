Made it through Day 1

I have been thinking about quitting for a while. Tapered myself off last year to just one cigarette a day and then went back to the usual routine. I'm not quite sure what finally flipped the switch for me, but Monday I had 4 left in a pack and I decided I wasn't going to buy anymore. I was really nervous about this first day and I'm surprised at the number of cravings I actually had versus what I was expecting. Here's to hoping tomorrow goes as well as today.

Last Cigarette, A New Hope

Let's face it, smoking's been a crutch of mine for almost two years. I have relied on it to solve my own inadequacies when facing a personal conflict. Now I am at the steps of another personal conflict: Mind vs body. 

Two years. Well, more like one and a half. My lung feel filled with ash and each cigarette feels like it coats my throat. I feel as though there is mucus in my chest I could expunge but I don't know how. My body tells me to quit or it will quit on me. 

I wish I could exercise the way I used to without feeling nauseous. I've tried to quit with friends but they would buckle, in turn I would buckle. So here I am making a post to make a promise. Whether or not anyone wants to watch me quit or listen, I choose to make this personal post an entry log for myself.

Maybe it'll help me. Maybe it'll help other people. Today I quit. Thank you for this community. I've been a lurker for a while. Never been courageous enough to post.

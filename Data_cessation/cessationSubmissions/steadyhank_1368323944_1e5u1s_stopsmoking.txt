Looks like I missed my six months mark. Ain't even mad!

Hey folks, this is my first time posting here. Just thought I'd share a few words to any that were interested. First of all, I'd like to thank you all for sharing your thoughts, stories and motivation on this sub - back when my cravings were a lot stronger it helped to know that my suffering was not unique. I love you all, and I wish you all the best of luck in quitting. 

For me, after quitting, I decided to replace my smoking habit with running. I'd highly recommend this, as the progress I saw in my cardiovascular capacity really helped keep me disciplined in quitting. I lost 25 pounds doing this, which was pretty cool. Afterwards I decided to start a bodybuilding split, because I looked really skinny. I'm still skinny, but regardless, replacing smoking with fitness has given me a new passion that I can be proud of, and I look ten times healthier, even after a mere six months.

Thanks for reading, and good luck to you all. I know you hear it all the time, but it really DOES get easier after time!

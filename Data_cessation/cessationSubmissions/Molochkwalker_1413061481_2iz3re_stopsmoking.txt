Day five, feels like I'm dying

Holy shit, I'm never going through this again. Never!! My body feels like battlefield. The last five days have been super bleak, super depressing, like everything is unreal, made out of plastic. The physical feelings hit me tonight. Massive nausea, light headedness and full on anxiety of the worst kind. The crippling kind.

FUCK THIS. FUCK YOU CIGARETTES. IM NEVEREVER FUCKING SMOKING AGAIN EVER

Afraid of damages. Not tempted, but worried.

I'm 45 and I smoked for 20 years or so. The last couple of years I have stopped for a few days to a week on and off multiple times.  I'm on day nine now and I know I probably have taken some time off my life. I have a pretty consistant product cough and I guess that is normal, and will probably get better, but all I can think about is COPD.  My nerves are shot.  But I am not going to smoke over it at all.  The mere idea makes me gag.  I quit cold turkey, and I am over the physical withdrawals, just this paranoia and the cough/mucous. 

What can I do to feel better?

37 days after 26 years. So much snot.

Sorry to be gross but I'm constantly feeling like I'm getting a sore throat and I have a lot of snot all the time lately.  I guess it's just my lungs clearing themselves out which is a great thing.  I'm also tired and lethargic a lot lately.  It's kind of been bumming me out how tired and unenthusiastic I've been.  Still worth it.

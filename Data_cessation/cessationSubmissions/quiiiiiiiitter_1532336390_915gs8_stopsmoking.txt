Today I turn 30.

Several years ago, my sister pulled me aside and quietly told me that she wasn’t going to support me smoking, but she didn’t want to be annoying about it, so she said she wouldn’t say anything until I turned 30. No snide remarks, no eye-rolling, no “when’re you gonna quit?” that loving families tend to do. She’d give me until 30.  

Today I turn 30 and have 4 months of no smoking behind me. A solid head start on what she asked for. I’m going to call her today. 

Thanks, sis.

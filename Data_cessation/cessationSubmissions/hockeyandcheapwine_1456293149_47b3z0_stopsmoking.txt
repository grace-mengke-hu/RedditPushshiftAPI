Here we go...

After 10 years, this is it. I've had enough. I started smoking when I was 14. I swore that I'd never ever smoke. But it happened. 10 damn years. Enough is enough. I'm tired of smelling like smoke, I'm tired of having to go outside like an animal, I'm tired of the dirty looks, and I'm tired of being tired. And I'm definitely tired of wasting money. So much money. 

Although in a messed up way, I kind of feel like I'm throwing a part of myself away. Then I think about how awful smoking makes me feel now and it's not so bad. I'm planning on starting the patch later (It's almost 1 AM now). And chewing gum. Lots of chewing gum. I think I'll learn how to knit so I can concentrate on something and keep my hands busy. 

I'm scared. But I know it'll get better. Sorry if I'm rambling, but I needed to get this off of my chest. I've been lurking for a couple of days and this community seems awesome. Wish me luck!

4 weeks smoke-free, and I need some help!

Sorry for an almost misleading title, but I need your help, Reddit!

I am 4 weeks smoke free, and to celebrate soon, my partner and I are doing one of those stair climbs for the American Lung Association. Help us with a team name!

TLDR; team name help for a charity stair climb!

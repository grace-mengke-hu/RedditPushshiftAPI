3 weeks in - here's what I learned

Passing today's milestone feels really good. 21 days of not smoking felt insurmountable three weeks ago! Here's what helped me so far:


1) As I've posted elsewhere, I used both Alan Carr's Easyway and Joel Spitzer's Freedom From Nicotine books to get me motivated. The combination of both books was what I needed.


2) I stayed away from smoking situations the first 3 days, then I deliberately went to all the places I would go when I smoked and did what I normally do - just not with a cigarette. This was hard at times, but every time I "passed a test" I felt more resolved in my quit. I didn't want to give nicotine more power over me by letting it ruin my friendships and social life. 


3) I have been tracking everything in the Smoke Free app and coming here often to lurk (and sometimes to post). Both help stop a craving by reminding me why I quit and how far I've made it.


4) Cravings really don't last very long. I ride them out, one at a time, and sometimes I set a timer if they are really strong. Distractions help. Drink water, chew gum, get up and go for a walk, etc.


5) My boyfriend is a heavy smoker and I was afraid of it affecting my quit. I got a 0% nicotine vape from Virgin Vapor as my emergency crutch. It's saved my ass several times when he was smoking around me. I've pledged to stop using it at all when I hit one month.


For all the New Year's quitters, you're in the hard part right now but it gets better pretty soon. Keep going!

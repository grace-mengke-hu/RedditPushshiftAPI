Day 0 - again

I seriously need to quit - my Doctor warns me that I am at the precipice of a major smoking related disease if I don't quit immediately. 

I have quit several times in the past for varying periods of time from 2 days to months. But this time I need to make it happen. Cold Turkey is my preferred way, the majority of the pain goes away in 3-4 days and then its a smoother ride.

But the first 3-4 days are the hardest, looking forward to being a dick at work and at home.

Any fellow quit starters out here ? Maybe we can keep tabs on each other ..

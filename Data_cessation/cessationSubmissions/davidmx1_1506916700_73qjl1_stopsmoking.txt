CBD could be very beneficial as a natural smoking cessation aid

CBD is a non-psychoactive component in marijuana that will not get you high like THC. I originally picked up a CBD vape as a sleeping aid last week or so and started to notice something weird. When i vaped CBD my craving for a usual cigarette diminished substantially.  I mean I still wanted to smoke but it was like I was choosing to rather than my body and mind forcing me to like clockwork.  I smoked way less all of a sudden. couple days ago i just went cold turkey out of the blue and it's like i don't even care or something.  I forgot that I didn't smoke for 2 days now. It's really strange actually.

almost 1 week!

And still holding strong. 

I realize this go round how valuable my previous attempts at quitting were. I used to see them as failures, but now I can see how much I learned from them. I understand that monster much better than I did my first few attempts. Not to say that bastard is any easier... I just understand better how he works now. And forewarned is forearmed.

Today was tough... bunches of stressors with a very sick kid, car issues... lots of pains in the rear. But I made it, I did not smoke and I am so proud of myself for being strong.

How did your day go today? Any high points or low points you'd like to share?

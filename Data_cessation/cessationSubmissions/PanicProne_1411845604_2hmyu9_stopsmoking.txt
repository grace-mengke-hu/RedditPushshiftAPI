Quit 3 weeks ago, but I crave food more than cigs! Will it ever go away?

After 10 years of moderate smoking (4-8 cigarretes per day), I have quit 3 weeks ago.

It has not been expectionally hard to curb the cigarrette cravings, but the food cravings are relentless.

Will they ever go away, or will I be forever super hungry all the time? I really don't want to gain any weight.

16 days in - I run 21km this week!

I've never been a "heavy smoker"  usually &lt;10 a day.


I decided to quit, and a couple of days later i went and bought a fancy new pair of running shoes and i gave it a shot.

I've always tried to do some sport, like working out, bjj,...


But running has always been a nightmare since i started smoking.


Now with a lot of effort i made it to my first week of running, and i'm loving it.


Just the feeling, after a cold run, to take a hot shower, shave, put some deodorant on and go and eat a healthy meal.. God i missed feeling this good.


And the sleep.. never slept so profoundly i years, i wake up with sore legs and it feels amazing, because iv'e put effort in doing it.

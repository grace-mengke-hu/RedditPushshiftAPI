Haven't had a cigarette since Thursday. Do you tell your friends you're quitting or keep it to yourself?

I was really sick last week. Stomach was crappy, and starting to get a sore throat. The thought of food or cigarettes made me gag, so I didn't smoke the entire time. So then it was Thursday. Two days without a cigarette. I smoked the last one in my pack, and realized what an empty, foul tasting thing it was. I always pictured my last cigarette as a ceremonious things, and had always tried to "enjoy" the last one in previous attempts to quit.

So, its now Sunday. And I'm on my fourth day. I didn't really have any strong cravings at all. Actually, I felt inclined to make other good choices. Switched my typical soda out with a bottle of water. Cleaned up some.  

I don't want to tell anyone that I'm quitting. Not sure why....but I seem to be doing better keeping it to myself. Though I think its so if I do want one in a social situation, I can have one without being judged by my friends.

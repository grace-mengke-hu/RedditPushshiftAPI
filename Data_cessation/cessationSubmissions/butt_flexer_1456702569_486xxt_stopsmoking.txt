Why does everyone make a mountain out of a molehill?

I smoked for around 10 years and for the last 2-3 years I was smoking a pack a day, and I really hated it. I wanted to quit but I was scared because I tried to quit before and I only ever made it to the 2nd day and felt like I couldn't work, think, or do anything except lay in bed or something. It felt like my eyeballs were gonna pop out unless I had a smoke.

Most of what made me anxious about quitting was how people on here and everywhere else made it seem like it was this horrible ordeal that never ended. That every minute is some kind of agony, and you need to come on this sub-reddit for support or you'll never make it, etc. etc.

Well, I just wanted to let you know that you guys are ********. It's not like that at all. Quitting smoking is pretty easy. I'm now on week 2 after reading The Easy Way to Quit Smoking, and I just don't really care about it anymore.

Why would you perpetuate this fear if there's no basis for it? It stops people from trying to quit, and makes them panic when they do.

Why don't more people realize that 95% of the crap they apparently experience when trying to quit smoking are their own damn fault? Placebo and fear, that's it. I can't even say that I feel a physical difference from days 2/3 and any other day ever.

The book showed me pretty clearly that the ordeal of quitting smoking is mostly just in our heads, so why do even doctors still act like it isn't?

Is there something I'm missing here, or is everyone else missing something?

Scared of The Dizziness

I desperately want to quit smoking. I've been smoking for about 4 years now, and since then my eyesight has deteriorated quite a lot, I quite fuzzy vision constantly which gets worse when I'm craving a fag. Dry eye from cigarettes perhaps?

Anyway when I wake up in the morning, my vision is awful and my brain is foggy and I feel dizzy until I've had that first cigarette. I've actually had panic attacks from this awful feeling before I've had the first cigarette of the day.

I'm worried that if I just quit, the dizziness and brain fog along with the poor vision is going to be really scary and make me feel like death.

Would it be better for me to start slowly cutting down and weaning myself off rather than just stop and go cold turkey, and does anyone else experience this awful feeling when they wake up too?

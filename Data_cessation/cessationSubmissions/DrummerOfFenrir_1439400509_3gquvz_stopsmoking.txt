Last one... Anxious about the future

Today is the day, I've had my last one, and me and my wife are quitting together. We will be each other's support, but I'm still anxious about it all. What do I do on my breaks at work? All those times when I know I'll crave, what to do?

Wish us luck as we take this journey

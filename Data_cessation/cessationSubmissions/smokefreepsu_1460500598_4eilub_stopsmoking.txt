Smoke-Free Campus at Penn State

Hello all,
Recently, the undergraduate association at Penn State voted 34-4 to support a smoke-free campus policy. However, there's still some debate over whether or not this is a good idea. As a student at Penn State, I'm working with some other students to form a petition aimed towards the board of trustees to push a campus ban on smoking. Sign the petition to help Penn State join 1,500 other colleges in making their campus totally smoke free!

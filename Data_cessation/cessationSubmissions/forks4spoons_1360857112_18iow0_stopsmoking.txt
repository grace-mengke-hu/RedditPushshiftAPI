A Valentine to myself... 100 days!

I can't believe I've made it this far!!! I can't believe it's already here! 100 days and not one single puff! Not to mention I don't really have any desire to do so! I'm so excited! :D

Next monday starts W1D1 of the Couch 2 5k training as well as doing a whole 30 clean eating challenge.  Time to get myself back in shape now that I'm confident I am a nonsmoker! :)

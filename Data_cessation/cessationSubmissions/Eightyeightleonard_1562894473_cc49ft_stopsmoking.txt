4th day

Stopped Sunday. On bupropion for about 10 days prior for both depression and smoking cessation. Noticed on day 3 or so that the desire to smoke went thru the floor. But still that 7:00-8:00 PM hour ... Smoke read sit outside. That's been the tough hour every day. So far so good. To combat it I just stay busy ... House, hobbies, etc.

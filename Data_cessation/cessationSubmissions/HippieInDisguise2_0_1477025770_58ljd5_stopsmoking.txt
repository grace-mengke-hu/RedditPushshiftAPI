I've been smoking for a few months, but now I feel I'm truly addicted.

So I started smoking occasionally like a 3 years ago, but it was ONLY when I was getting drunk at a party or something and it was never my own cig. 

Then I started a really stressful outdoor job working 80 or so hours a week through the summer and thought "what the hell" and used cigs to mitigate the stress. 

It's now October, and up until 20 minutes ago I hadn't had a cig in about a week. I just went to my car where I had a half-smoked cig in my ash tray and smoked that because I was having a REALLY intense craving that lasted about two hours and I couldn't sleep.

Any advice? 

EDIT: I realize now that my post sounds incredibly distant, I just want to express that these cravings are absolutely terrible. My dad told me to quit while I can, and I'm trying. But if these cravings are here to stay, I don't really know how I'm going to deal with them.

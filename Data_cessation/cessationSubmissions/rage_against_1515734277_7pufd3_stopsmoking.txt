Anyone use ecigs to help quit?

Been a pack a day for theast 7-8 years, went cold turkey the day before New year's. So I guess I haven't smoked a cig all year lol. But I have been using disposable ecigs when I drink to get through it, and recently bought a juul to help to save money on buying disposables. Been going well so far but what do y'all think about the whole ecig thing? I know nictone is still going in but I am doing so much better. 

Thanks for the input guys.

Cravings are less frequent!

Last night I was hanging with a buddy of mine who had quit cigarettes with me on the same day. (we smoked the last two of a pack together)
He mentioned that his lungs were feeling much better and I realized that I forgot I was quitting smoking. Like, I pushed cigarettes out of my mind enough so that I've gone a few days without craving them.

Just wanted to tell the world

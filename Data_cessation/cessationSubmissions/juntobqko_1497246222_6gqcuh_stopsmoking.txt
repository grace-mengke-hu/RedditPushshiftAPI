Can you help me get my believes in order?

I've tried to quit for so many times and yet I still get back to  it. My longest streak was a year but things happened and I picked it up again. 

I think the problem ist that my subconscious or whatever still doesn't  understand that smoking doesn't give me anything and that it just Is a drug addiction. But Secretly I still believe that smoking gives me comfort and relieves stress. I mean everytime I smoke I feel relieved in a way. I know logically that otherwise is true. I try to focus on how sick I feel everytime I smoke and how it doesn't do anything for me. But it still didn't make click for me. I might go without  it a couple of hours and then end up rationalising why I should start again


Any advice?

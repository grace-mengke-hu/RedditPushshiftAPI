Taking the plunge

29[m] 30 + a day started when I was 12. On my last pack now was going to wait till I get back from holiday in a couple of weeks but I've just reached a point where I am sick of my habit for a load of reasons. This is not going to be easy for me I have a VERY addicive personality and am very habitual too. Literally finding it hard to even imagine life without smoking...  :S Wish me luck!

When i run out, im done.

I have 8 cigarettes, I'm going to try to stop smoking for about the fourth or fifth time in my life so far. 

I'm lighting up number 8, tonight I hope to slow down, but still end it all. Im going to perhaps save one for a desperate moment, my uncle says this helps. Not so much with craving but mentally knowing you're not out, you're not on empty box status. 
Knowing it's there, but you're strong enough to leave it there.

Anyone have any advice or Input?

About me: started when I was 17-18. Can't remember which, said id only smoke for a while, then I'm 24 now. Six years I wasted so much money. So much unnecessary stress, so much regret, and struggle, and all for a stupid white stick that tasted like warm dirt.

I'm bad about romanticizing the idea of lighting up, of that first hit in the mornings, just like my dad.

Now, I'm a dad, and I have to be healthy. Strong, and most of all, addiction-free. 
I was an alcoholic, and have had trouble with drugs for a time in my life, I am convinced if i am able to overcome a morphine AND alcohol addiction, I can surely overcome something as simple as a cigarette?

My logic has always made it confusing, morphine pills and alcohol made me feel a certain way, there was no mistaking a "high" because how do you? It so obviously makes you feel a certain way, think a certain way, sleep, eat, move...in an addicted way. As I pieced this together, I realized the feeling and the life style was what I was addicted to, when I cut these things away I found my relief. 

Cigarettes however...smoking feels natural to me, comforting, but not a high. Not a buzz, just like breathing. I feel perfectly normal. 
When I don't smoke, I know I'm addicted. 
I want that to end tonight.

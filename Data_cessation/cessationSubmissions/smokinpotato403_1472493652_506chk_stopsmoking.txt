Day 2 and the weight on my chest is getting harder to ignore...

There is a great deal of weight on my chest. My guess is that it is from the anxiety of quitting. It doesn't seem to go away, except for when I first wake up. It is hard to take a deep breathe.

Does anyone else feel this way? Any suggestions on how to get rid of it?

So I cheated last week....

Yes yes before you shame me like Cersei Lannister, I'm going to reset my badge. I tossed my pack last Sunday and haven't bought one since. However working in heavy construction and on night shift lead to some intense cravings and too many people willing to oblige when I asked them for one. (<--You can shame me now for making an excuse)

I am however glad to say that my last cigarette was on Saturday (3/18) morning at 7am and as of this post it has been 64 hours since my last cigarette. I bought the patch this morning and happily I can say it has alleviated the cravings thus far. I stood around 3 other people who were all smoking and was not even phased.

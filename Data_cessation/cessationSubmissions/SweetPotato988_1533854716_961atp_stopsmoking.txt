4.5 hours smoke free

But it feels so much longer than that. It’s all I can think about. I want to go down to 7/11 and get a pack, but I know I’ll smoke every single one of them before I go to sleep tonight. And maybe go get more. And definitely throw my partner off course, since we quit together today. I know it’s only going to get harder, but at this point I feel like I’ve had a continuous craving for an hour and I’m ready to climb the wall. How am I going to handle this when it gets REALLY hard?? I’ve been a pack a day smoker for 7 years, sometimes up to 2 packs. This is actually the farthest I’ve gotten, and the first time I’ve really quit with intent. My game plan is Wellbutrin, which I have been on for 6 days and otherwise cold turkey. I find vaping acceptable and have used NRT to cut down, but otherwise I’m going cold turkey and those are my “options” I guess. I expect to spend the next several hours deep cleaning my smoked inside of house, listening to podcasts, and biting my fingernails. Advice?

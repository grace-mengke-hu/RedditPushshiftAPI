Had a close call

So I went out to the store specifically to buy a pack, but I kept thinking it over and over on my way to the store, feeling guilty until I eventually bought Cranberry Juice instead of cigarettes. 
I've read Allen Carr's book. 
Is it likely I just had an episode of the addicted brain trying to trick me?
Or is it a wrong frame of mind? (Note: I do want to stay quit and I understand the fundamental messages Allen Carr's book states)
Thanks guys

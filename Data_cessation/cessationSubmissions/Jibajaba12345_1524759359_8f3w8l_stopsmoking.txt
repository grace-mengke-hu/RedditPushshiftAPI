Lack of confidence after quitting? Is this normal?

So some back story i used to smoke a pack a day for 4 years . Due to a change in my career i stopped smoking for around 9 months. After that experience I've been off and on for the last 5 years. Sometimes going a month or so without a cigarette and other times smoking a whole pack in a night when out drinking with friends. I never picked it up habitually again after that first 9 month break, i smoked more for a social aspect when around friends at work or out drinking. Recently i decided to stop this behavior altogether but I've noticed my confidence in social settings has taken a hit. I used to be really outgoing and fun to be around and lately I've been more of a recluse, avoiding large crowds or social interaction. Sometimes when i do decide to have a cigarette or two on a night out, i feel more confident and carefree. Has anyone else experienced this? Is this normal?

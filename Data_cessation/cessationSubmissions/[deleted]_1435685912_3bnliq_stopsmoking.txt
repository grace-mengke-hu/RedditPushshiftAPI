Weed makes you soft

I feel like this is true for 90% of the world just noone admits it. Weed/being high makes you a soft person. If you are sober you feel confident to talk to girls and to be in crowds, however when high you feel like a bitch. It also gives you less control over yourself. Being high always makes me watch porn, even though when i am sober or even drunk i am repulsed by the idea. Weed makes you soft.

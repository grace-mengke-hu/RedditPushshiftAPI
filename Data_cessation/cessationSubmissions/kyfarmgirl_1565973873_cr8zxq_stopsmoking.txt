NOPE=Not One Puff Ever

Day 4 of my challenge. Going well. I haven’t smoked even one. I LOVE the stop smoking app I am using (smoke Free). I also love my NOPE mantra.  If I start to think about smoking I repeat my mantra. I’ve stopped so many times in the past.  I usually make it through the first week or two then cave!!  I am a 25+year smoker.  Sadly the cost is what has pushed me to quit (wish it were my health). I made a “tattoo” on my wrist of how much I spend a month on cigarettes to help me stay focused.  I use all the tools in the app. I am also “hiding out” for a week.  Really imagining myself as a non smoker in every situation. 

Good luck everyone!!!

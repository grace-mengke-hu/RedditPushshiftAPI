Second day in

After starting to smoke with 16 and then smoking for 5 years I decided to stop with a friend who wants to quit as well. I'm on my second day in, so far my cravings aren't that bad, though I smoked around 15 cigs per day.

I guess quitting with a friend is a rather good motivation, but I'd appreciate any kind of advice that could help me in the next days, weeks and months to come.

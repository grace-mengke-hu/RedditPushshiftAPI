Day 0

Quitting smoking is easy. I've done it hundreds of time. Seriously though, I thought I had it down. July 29th was the going to be the last day I smoked a cigarette. I had gotten very depressed and sedentary and I knew I had to turn my life around. So I quit.

At first, it was pretty easy. I had an e-cig and could hit it at work all the time. Sure, I quit "smoking", but I was still getting *some* nicotine, even if it was from a $10 little vape stick.

Then school started. It's my senior year and this semester was going to be my hardest yet. I started going to the bars more on weekends and would see people smoking and think, "boy that looks nice." Suddenly I was bumming cigs from my friends, and they always felt great. The buzz I got after nearly a month of no smoking felt way better than anything an e-cig would give me.

Midterms rolled around, and I was getting more stressed. At this point I would go the library, see a stranger smoking, and ask if I could bum a cig. Then I bought a pack. I figured it'd be fine if I only had one a day. Well, one a day became two a day, then three a day, sometimes four, five...

At this point I was telling myself, "fuck it, I can smoke," and that was fine, until it wasn't. School was weighing heavily on me with finals approaching and I was buying 3 or 4 packs a week now. I'd be smoking nearly every hour I was studying, and in between smokes I would always be thinking about the next one. It was distracting.

Now finals week is over, and I suddenly feel so relieved. My desire to smoke has diminished greatly, and I think now is the time to quit. To actually quit. To finally not buy a pack and to be able to say no to the drunken bum-a-cig. After "quitting" for a little bit month and learning about how the cigarettes creep up on you, I feel I have a lot better chances to succeed this time. This way, I'll get a head start on New Years.

Thanks for reading.

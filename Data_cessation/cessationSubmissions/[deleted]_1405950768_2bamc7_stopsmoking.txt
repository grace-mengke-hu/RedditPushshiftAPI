Rebellion

I have this nasty mindset of sneaky rebellion, where I seem to find great satisfaction in not doing what I'm supposed to do. I will pretty much invent authority in order to rebel against it, and feel a rush of gloating power when I do so. This seems to apply even when the authority is me. 

I'm supposed to quit smoking. I find myself getting very stubborn about it, engaging in all manner of convoluted thinking. I am framing the issue as I usually do, so that having another cigarette is somehow a rebellious triumph. It feels like I'm getting away with something, haha you can't stop me, but the 'you' and the 'me' there are both me. I'm rebelling against myself. It's really stupid. 

I am 45 and I've smoked for 30 years. I had a heart attack two years ago. I was dead for three minutes. Oddly, I had quit smoking two months before that. I stayed quit for another few months, but then I had a bad day and I started again. Funny how a bad day could 'make' me start again, but 100 good days don't 'make' me quit. 

I am going to die. Again. Probably not just for three minutes. And yet I want one. Just a few thousand more smokes. I have chest pains and I still want one. The stress of worrying about a heart problem *makes me want a smoke*.  It is insane. 

The only thing that's working so far is pure rage. I am going to kill this habit. I hate it. Sucking on a cigarette, suck suck suck, needing it so bad. Goddamn it's embarassing. I think they should only sell cigarettes in the shape of pacifiers. 

With grim intensity I carry on.

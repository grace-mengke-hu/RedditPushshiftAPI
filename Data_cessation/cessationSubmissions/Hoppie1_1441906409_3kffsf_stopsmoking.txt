Quit smoking???

'M new to this site, 
so please overlook if I post
 in the wrong place.

Well I was a smoker for 26 years
 but I haven't had a cigarette since 
August 31, 2015. I was just wondering
 when is it okay to 
refer to yourself as a non-smoker? 
Should you be smoke free for a day, 
week, month, or a year?

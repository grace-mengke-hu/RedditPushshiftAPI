I'm pretty desperate... I've tried a lot of ways to quit, but not all of the ways yet. Help?

The problem I'm facing:

I've been feeling incredibly sick lately. I've gone to the doctors, I have no trace of any cancer in my blood or in xrays conducted. I've recently gone to the hospital because I felt as if I was going to pass out. I breathe and feel as if my lungs don't receive any of the oxygen. It's all in my head and I know it's my subconscious telling me I need to quit. I now feel sick after every cigarette I smoke but it's still not enough for me to completely quit.

It's become more than an addiction to me. It's become as routine as a daily shower. Wake up- smoke, drinking coffee after shower- smoke, get in the car- smoke, drive back home- smoke, just got back home- smoke, finished a raid- smoke, I'm bored- smoke.

What I've done:

I've eliminated the just-woke-up smoke and the last-one-for-the-night smoke.

I've stopped playing League of Legends. (I found myself smoking a cig after every single game meaning every 20-40 minutes I was smoking at least 10 times a day).

I've purchased World of Warcraft and it began to be a great tool since it always demanded my immediate attention but after I maxed out two characters in a month and a half it's no longer proving to be an effective tool.

I've tried quitting cold turkey only to find myself automatically passing by a store and purchasing a pack of cigarettes and hating myself shortly after.

I've given away full packs to random people who ask for a smoke.

I've thrown away full and half packs.

I've tried to replace my driving smoke with drinking water instead. Doesn't work at all anymore.

I've lost family members to cancer last year and it haunts me that they didn't smoke or do anything significantly unhealthy enough to constitute cancer while I'm here smoking which is a sure fire way to commit slow suicide. I just don't know what to do anymore. Can you guys help me out?

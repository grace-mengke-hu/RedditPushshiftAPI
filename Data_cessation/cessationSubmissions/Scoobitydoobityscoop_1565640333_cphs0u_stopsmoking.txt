At a crossroads

I quit vaping a few months ago, and lasted a full month without any nicotine. It was hard at times but I was happy with myself and adjusting to a new lifestyle. Soon after, I had a string of extremely difficult days where I barely scrapped by without relapsing, until a day came where I was just slightly too weak and caved.

From there I was able to return to quitting, and didn't have too much trouble going nicotine free again. But as we all know, even one puff will refuel the addiction.

I eventually had a similar experience 2 weeks later where I relapsed for one day with a vape. I stopped with no problem, but then only lasted a week before the next one. The gaps have (to no one's surprise) gotten shorter over time. Fast forward to now, and while I can still go multiple days without it, it's becoming increasingly more common for me to vape several times per week, and probably use nicotine about half of my week now.

I know this can only get worse from here, but I'm really struggling to stop altogether. Most times since the relapse have been easy to rationalize because I had no problems getting off it, but now I truly feel the roller-coaster of addiction in a real way again. I feel its absence on my days off and relish on my days on. I need to break this cycle because if I'm being honest with myself, it's just as bad as being a daily user. I won't have nicotine in any shape or form today.

Ugh. I started up again.

I had smoked for 16 years and was up to a pack a day for several years. I had been feeling awful. Wheezing. Cough. The smell. On 10/1/18 I quit. I was doing amazing. I felt great and good things were coming into my life. I was ALMOST to 90 days smoke free. Then the holidays and extended time with my family- many of which smoke. The stress and the availability and I just backslid and bought my first pack since September. Iâ€™m so disappointed and frustrated with myself. I had been so proud to be smoke free. I need words of encouragement that I can still be a non smoker :(

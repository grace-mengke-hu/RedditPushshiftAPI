Please tell me I'm sane

So I quit nicotine (been smoking for a year and vaping a year after that). Been using 3mg juice, to be honest I was pretty much a chain vaper.


So I quit last Thursday, in about 6 hours I will be nicotine free in 4 days for the first time in two years. I know it's not a long time but I want to kill this addiction asap.

I'm having horrible withdrawal, sweating at night, not being able to sleep, wake up every 30 minutes, feeling confused, lightheaded and fatigued. Im starting to worry these symptoms are not normal.

I'm really scared to lie awake again, I have to get up early so I really need my sleep. Does anyone have any tips? Or do some of you relate? Don't get me wrong, I'm doing this, but I just want to be sure my reaction is just like any other individuals reaction.

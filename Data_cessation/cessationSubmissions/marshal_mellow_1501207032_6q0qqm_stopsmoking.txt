God I want a black and mild

I'm drunk. I really want a black and mild. I love those cigars and you can buy just one so it doesn't seem like a bad idea really. But it's been so long since I used nicotine of any kind. 

Super stressed about some fucked up medical stuff. (my nickname is about to be 9 toes) couldn't deal got drunk. 

Don't get drunk before you can handle it my friends. Shit is hard. But I think I got this. Gonna go buy sunflower seeds. A great alternate vice.

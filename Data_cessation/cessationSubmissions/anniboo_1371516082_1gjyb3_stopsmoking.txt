I've been smoking again for the past 2 months, and I refuse to reset my badge.

I did not smoke for a year and half without a problem, and then I thought I had it figured out, so I lit up one. And then another. And then another pack. "I can easily stop after that one" obviously was my brain trapping me, and succeeding. 

I see a lot of posts where people call themselves ex-smokers, and that they quit for good. But to me, once a smoker, always a smoker. 
Having a cigarette is easier than not having one. It is good to celebrate, but don't fall back in. It's even harder to quit for a second time -- because I'm still convinced I can stop any day. 

My badge should be at 0 days, but I need a reminder of how many days I could have made it so I feel bad enough to quit again. 

It might sound a little negative, but remember that you can fall back in any day. Don't let your brain trick you! We can do it.

Day #1 of no smoking after 8 years of one pack or less a day.

I didn't notice anything the first 10 hours because after 2 hours, I went to bed and slept for 8. I didn't notice anything either after I woke up, but after being awake for a few hours, I did notice I felt like I had a little more energy. Not necessarily more active, just clearer in the head and not as sluggish.

The withdrawals started a couple hours ago, so I bought some dark chocolate and a coffee with what would have been cigarette money. That helped for a little bit, but it's fading, so I bought some gum instead. I didn't get nicotine gum because the idea is to just remove all nicotine from my body in general.

It's annoying to have the cravings, but they pass and I feel like this will be a lot easier if I just focus on the awesome things I'll get out of not smoking rather than the bad things smoking does to me. Positive reinforcement, I guess. Overall I am in control and that's what I'm reminding myself of. 

How was everyone else's first day? Hard?

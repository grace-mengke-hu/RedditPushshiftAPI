How to make my thoughts less fuzzy?

Hey y'all - I've made a few attempts to quit (one lasted for two years!) and one of the worst things for me every single time is that for a couple of weeks, my head just feels like it's full of cotton wool. I can't concentrate on anything and it feels like my brain is running at half speed. Anyone have any tips?

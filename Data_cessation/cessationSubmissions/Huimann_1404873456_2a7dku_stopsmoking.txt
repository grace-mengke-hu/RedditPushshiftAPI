This time I'll do it! :)

I quit like 4 days ago and it's the longest time i've ever made without smoking :)

I am pretty motivated to do it this time. Even though it makes me feel bad, when I think about never smoking another cigarette again.

It is very easy for me, when I just don't buy any new...but I'm afraid of meeting with friends that smoke...I know i will ask them for a cigarette. How should I solve this?

Quit smoking, transitioned to vaping, quit vaping... Holy Hell Depression

So... I quit smoking a month ago (half a pack a day), transitioned to vaping (used it a TON at .6 nic), then went to 0% to quit smoking. For the past 10 days I have been in a deep depression and it has been the most terrifying experience of my life. It feels as though I am slowly realizing that life is a never-ending cycle through hell. I know this sounds crazy, but I just want to go back to feeling normal. It feels like I will never feel normal again because I am now aware of how the universe really works. I don't even want to smoke anymore. 

Has anyone experienced this kind of depression from quitting? How long did it last? I keep reading into depression and they say it's 2 weeks+

More info on the actual feelings: it's just like i randomly started feeling that I am slowly realizing that I am in hell. Life is a never ending cycle of existence that will never end. It's weird... I've known that life is eternal but somehow that feeling has transitioned into a nagging, pulling, drowning feeling that I will never not exist. That I am not my own creature. I am a part of this giant revolving life ecosystem that will never end. I don't want it to end, but the fact that it will never end keeps leading me to the fact that life itself is a hell in which you cannot escape. 
TLDR: I am now in the movie Groundhog Day...

Does it have to be all or nothing?

I’m at the point where if I have a smoke it’s awful. But it’s as though I need to keep proving the grossness to myself. I’ve only been quit 24hr now (before that I had two puffs so I reset my quit date). I’m using NRT and I know that’s not ideal either. What do you guys think? I’m terrified I’ll try another puff and like it. But I’m also feeling like I’m grieving. This is insane.

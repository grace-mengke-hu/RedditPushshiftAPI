Quit yesterday, not as bad as I thought it would be

I'm 31 and have been smoking since I was 24ish. Yesterday my fiancee saw my pack of smokes and made me promise to quit. Everyone in my family had been on me for years about my smoking so I figured now was as good a time as any to quit.

I have not gone 29 hours without a smoke. I am chewing nicotine gum (2mg) and have had 4 since morning. The recommended dosage is 12 for the first week but I do not feel the urge to chew the gum. I thought I would go through 20 gums a day but for whatever reason I do not feel the urge anymore.

I just hope I can keep it up.

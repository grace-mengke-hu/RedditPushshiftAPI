Feel like a failure

So I decided this week I wanted to quit and that this weekend was when it was going to happen. Thursday I had 10 which was about 2 less than my normal amount that has been cut down from about a pack to about a half a pack over the last few months, yesterday I had 4 which isn't bad and today I've had 3 so far but my pack is almost empty and I know I will buy another because when I think about not having smokes I have a panic attack or freak out. I keep justifying why I could keep smoking, just cut down a bit more maybe try agai. A better time, blah blah blah excuse excuse excuse. I've had 3 toady so far will probably have more because I'm at my breaking point and ready to throw in the towel, I downloaded the smoke free app and am mostly sick of resetting it, I made it to 13 hours and that's it so I'm tempted to delete it. I feel like shit I have these f**ked up feelings depression, anxiety this emptiness feeling, loneliness (way more than usual), feeling of wanting to be held feelings of helplessness just all kinds of messed up shit. I have social anxiety and don't have any friends and am also single as a result so when I say I have no one to lean on I have no one to lean on. I've always told myself when I smoke and had thoughts of maybe I should quit that it's better to live a short life alone with a horrible death  rather than a long life alone with a peaceful death. So now I'm at the point where I'm here again I don't feel like I can do this and I feel like a failure as a result. I am having thoughts of being a life long smoker and that's making me want to smoke even more. I just don't know what to do. I don't want to smoke, I just don't think I can not smoke

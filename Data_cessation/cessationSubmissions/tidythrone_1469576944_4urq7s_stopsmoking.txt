Threw out an unopened pack I found in my car.

The other day I was cleaning out my car and found an unopened pack under the passenger seat. I went to throw it away, but stopped. For some reason, this pack was much harder to throw away than the other 4 or 5 I threw out when I first quit about a month ago.

But I've been preparing. Whenever I get a strong urge - whether it's out with friends, driving in the car, or finding convenient cigarettes like this - I repeat to myself, "it's not good enough." I've made it this far, but it's not good enough. Nothing but "never again" is good enough.

I truly believe I would've caved if I hadn't prepared for that moment. For anyone just starting out, I highly recommend looking into [implementation intentions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation_intention). They are a powerful psychological tool for reaching a goal.

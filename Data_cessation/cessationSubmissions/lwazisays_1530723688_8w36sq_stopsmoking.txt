End of day 6

Stuck with this addiction for about 15 years now. I used to smoke anywhere between 5 and 20 a day where 20 being the drink nights.

I have always played some sport and I am well aware of affects this thing has had on my stamina. I always believed I can quit anytime but in reality, I was lying to myself. I will start strong and in few days, I will resort to that one harmless puff. It is not harmless. Trust me. 

This time I want to quit for good. I was having thoughts about quitting for couple of weeks before and was thinking to buy a vape. It is still in cart. 

Then I thought I would go cold turkey. So, I devised a plan. I never smoke around my family (I dont want anyone to pick this habit up due to me). So, I took 10 days off from work. I am at home most of the time where I don't even feel cravings. Only when I step out is when the routine kicks in. I just ask myself one question: health or sickness? I have always answered health and thus far. 

From what I have read, first couple weeks are tough. I will be through that. I just hope I do not relapse again once I am at work full time. It is like muscle memory now. I might automatically pull over at the store where I used to buy and go straight to smoking area in office before heading to my desk. 

I do not have a replacement idea for now. I guess it will be water and some mobile game. 

Hope I win this one and you all too.

5 days, i feel

Everyone posting is really glad they stopped smoking, they don't miss it by the end of day 3. Am I the only one waking up and going to bed (and waking up at night) with the thought of a smoke for 5 endless days now? 
I miss it, stopping has a devastating effect on my emotional stability. 
Does this shit ever pass? And if so - when?! 
What happened with "the first 3 days are the hardest"? Why does it get harder every day?

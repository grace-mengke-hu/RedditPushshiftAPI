Need advice

I'm 30 and been smoking for 12 years.I tried to quit many times but always end up smoking more.So a few days ago I woke up and out of nowhere decided today was going to be the day to try and quit.I went 2 days without one and was feeling really good but yesterday I gave in and brought a pack saying I would only smoke one.well one turned into 5.which is pretty good considering Im used to smoking 10 to 12 a day.Anyway I need some advice on what would be better.should I just try and do cold turkey which is really hard for me sometimes or to gradually quit.Today I told myself I was only going to smoke 5 again and so far so good.I was thinking Newsweek  i would only smoke 4 a day then next week 3 and so on so on until I'm nit smoking anymore.Has anyone had success with this.thanks

Im one month free!

Sorry, mobile

Heres some things ive noticed in the last month:

I can ride share with other people!! I used to never ride share so i could smoke but now i can spend time with others
A lot of drinks are more sour than they used to be.
I can smell SO much all the time
My legs and hands dont fall asleep constantly
I can stay later at work without being in an awful mood
I have more energy
My stomach doesnt feel like its dying everyday
No more acid reflux
My clothes and car smell so much better

Quitting is worth it. Remember, not another puff.

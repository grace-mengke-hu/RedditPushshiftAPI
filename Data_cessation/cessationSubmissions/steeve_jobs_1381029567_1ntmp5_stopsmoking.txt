Got back in after a week

I've started smoking exactly 11 months ago and have averaged approximately five cigarettes per day. Last week was the first time I stopped for a while. Went 166/168 hours in a week. The first 36 hours were fine but the next 14 were awful. However, I think this was due to me taking sleeping pills the night before and then taking a full 5-hour energy and 20mg Ritalin to alleviate the grogginess from the sleeping meds. I was extremely irritable and nervous. Day three was fine and then midway through day four till the start of day six I experienced the "flu like symptoms". This wasn't nearly as bad as a normal flu or antidepressant withdrawal (not fun!). My cravings weren't even there at the start of day 6. I'd watch people smoke on TV and in real life and I didn't even want one. However, my roommate was smoking and I thought, "why not?". I was just curious to see what it would do. Now I'm back where I started. Will I even experience withdrawal if I just had it a week ago considering I want to go cold turkey again.

My father quit smoking, relapsed, and now is living on his 15 minutes of fame, thinking he has control over the habit. How to help him quit again?

Hey guys,

So I’m having a lot of trouble with talking to my father about his smoking habit.

It seems to me that he’s convinced he can quit at any time because he had quit once for 4 months last year.

Obviously he always gets angry when I try to talk to him about this, and I’m a smoker myself (although he doesn’t know), so I understand why.

Bought him IQOS for his birthday a few days ago, and he was excited, but he hasn’t used it once, hasn’t even opened the box.

As he has already read the Easy Way book, that’s not an option. When I ask him to re-read it he just says that he already knows everything from the book and that he just needs “3 days of nobody bothering him” to quit again (always referencing how he quit last time) - and he’s been saying that for the past 7 months.

Currently we are on a vacation, so he has a lot more than “3 days”, but he rationalized it to himself how he doesn’t want to be stressed at a vacation. As he has very busy workdays, working as a CEO, I believe it’d be much easier to quit now, than in our hometown.

If anyone has any experience with a similar situation, could you share some advice? Honestly I am really sad watching his struggle, and I need to help him get over this.

A big thank you to anyone who had read this!

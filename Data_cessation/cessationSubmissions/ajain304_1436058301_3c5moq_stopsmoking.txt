Recently quit smoking but scared it has caused permanent brain damage. Help?

I was smoking on average half a pack a day for about 3.5 years but recently quit. I've been reading about how smoking causes brain damage and now feel extremely stupid about having smoked. Could anyone care to explain what kind of damage, if any, these 3.5 years of smoking may have caused? Have I become permanently dumber and/or has my brain become permanently slower? Also, in what possible ways could I try to reverse this damage?

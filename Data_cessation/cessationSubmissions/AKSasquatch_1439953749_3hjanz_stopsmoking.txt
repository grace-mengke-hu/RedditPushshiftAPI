Several Questions at day 3.

I'm light, 2-5 max (was more when I was younger) a day for 7 years or so, in my mid twenties.   I developed a cough about 3 weeks ago, I believe it was following a cold but can't quite remember.  Well anyway since my immediately went to "holy fuck must be lung cancer" I'm now on day 3 with no cigarette, I feel like my cough as gotten worse, my anxiety (I also have a panic disorder) has gotten worse, and I've had diarrhea and constipation.   Are these normal symptoms?  I've gone days, sometimes weeks without one but don't remember having these symptoms before.  Also my heath provider told me I needed a chest x-ray, so I'm pretty damn scared about that naturally.

Is there any cause for concern?

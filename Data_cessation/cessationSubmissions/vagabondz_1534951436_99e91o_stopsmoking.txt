Day 1

I can't afford this any more but on top of that I've been wanting to quit (again) for ages now. I haven't enjoyed any of my cigarettes for a while now and I'm tired of waking up with the taste of ash and not being able to taste anything and not being able to breathe. I had no money because of this but now I will. Thanks for this subreddit it is really encouraging. I'm going to try to post regular updates. Whenever I make a commitment to quit with my real-life acquaintances I end up disappointing so I'm just going to keep quiet for now and rely on you guys for support.

I'm going cold turkey. It's the only thing that worked in the past and when I tried nicotine replacement I always ended up smoking on top of it. I'm going to go dump my ashtrays now so I don't have butts to dig through. Wish me luck

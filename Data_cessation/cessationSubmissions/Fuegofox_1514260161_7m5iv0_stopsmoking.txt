Letsgoooo!! Look at that smiling star!

Self indulgent smily face star post. Here to celebrate, tell a little story and offer whatever advice I can for everyone beginning their quits now or in the coming week. 

I am 27, smoked for about 8 years prior to last year, about a pack a day by the end. Typical "secret smoker" hiding it from my friends and my family. Obviously could not REALLY hide it, I am sure everyone knew. Parents found out way back when and were very upset. Lied to them for years saying I had quit even though I hadn't and I am still ashamed of that. I avoided hanging out with my friends to sneak off for a smoke, drove an extra 10 minutes with the windows down and temps below 10 degrees F just to air the car out and doing just about anything to hide the smell.  I was pretty ashamed of my self at the time, and my biggest regrets in life thus far is wasting those prime years of my life as a slave to the death stick. 

Like most, I tried to quit a billion times. I tried lozenges, patches, gum and chantix. Ive read Allen Carr a couple of times too. I didn't want to be a slave to whatever company that was profiting off my slow death. Ended up cold turkey-ing it, and haven't looked back. 

 Anyway here is what helped me on my quit:
-I do believe that cold turkey is the way to go, though if NRT or hypnotism or vaping is what helps you, freaking go for it. But knowing that there is no more nicotine in your system, and that your chemical dependency is gone helped my psychologically.
-Cold water and lots of it. Helped with cravings when I was stuck at my desk. Get a good water-bottle, and keep it with you everywhere you go. And hydration is good for you so 2X the bonus 
-I think this was a message from Allen Carr and the Easy Way, but what helped my not spark one up is to say, "the only thing that will make you want a cigarette more than you do right now, is smoking one." Always kept me from bumming one from a stranger or a buddy at a bar. 
-I have seen posts to the scene from the first season of House of Cards, when Doug Stamper is at an AA meeting, and his "Fuck the Zero" speech. That fear/motivation helped me. If you haven't seen it, go youtube it. Great motivation IMO.
-Have a quit day a week ahead so you can ramp up to it. And if you fail, don't go through that process of buying a pack, smoking one and throwing it out saying you have quit. Then repeating again and again. Stop, take another week or two, and get at it again with everything you got. 

Sorry if any of this came of preachy. For the longest time I thought I was a lost cause when it came to quitting. I just want everyone to know that they can do it too. Just need to find the right method that works for you! These are my two cents.

Stay strong! If have any questions or whatever feel free to shoot my a message! There is not better decision you can make for yourself than to quit smoking.

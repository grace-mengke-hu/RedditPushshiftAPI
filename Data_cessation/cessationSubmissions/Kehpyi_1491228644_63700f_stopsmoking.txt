2 weeks!

Anyone just quitting I would track my cravings thus: 

Day 1: Awful
Day 2: Awful but glad I managed Day 1
Day 3: HOW IS THIS GETTING HARDER
Day 4: Magically slightly better

Rest of week 1 - really fancy a smoke but not going mad anymore 

First half week 2 - occasionally forget about smoking entirely. Eating like a horse

Second half of week 2- trying to fight the little voice that says I can smoke again because I've broken the addiction haha

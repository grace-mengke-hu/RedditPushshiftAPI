What is working

My mission with my stop smoking app is to post what is working for me today.   Things that help me tremendously are - when I think about cigarettes to train my brain to think of something else.  Honestly I have became a music junkie.  I listen to all kinds of new music on my I phone.  I also read, and play brain building games.  I am also trying to teach my brain to crave breath savers instead of cigarettes.  The sensation in my mouth is similar.  So I pretend it is my "fix".

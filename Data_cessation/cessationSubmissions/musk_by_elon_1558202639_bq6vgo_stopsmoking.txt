Im surprised at how quickly i feel back to normal, I thought the withdrawal would last months.

I've tried over 15 times to quit nicotine alltogether. I did both vaping qnd smoking so the addictionwas interchangeable. I was addicted for almost a decade. Everytime I tried to quit i would start having episodes on the second day where I felt extremely disconnected from reality which made me relapse. I thought the disconnected feeling would last for months. Now im at day 5 and feel completly back to normal like how I did before addiction. Obviously there are subtle brain changes that will take longer to repair but for the most part its not as bad as I thought it would be.

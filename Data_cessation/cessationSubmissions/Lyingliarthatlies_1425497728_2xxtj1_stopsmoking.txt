Quit smoking on 11/09/11 but still have cravings.

Does anyone else still have this issue? I have cravings all of the time. Some days, it's really bad. Some days I'm so tempted to buy a pack but figured that I've made it this far, why start again now? Other friends who have quit don't have this issue. 

I don't eat bad foods. I'm fairly healthy. I don't drink soda or alcohol except on rare occassion. Maybe had 3 sodas all of last year. I don't do drugs. Fast food is something I hate and only get if necessary. 

Any ideas?

Day 7 is tomorrow. Days 1-5 were GREAT days. Now depression is setting in.

Last time I quit I got depressed and thought it was because of Chantix. Guess it wasn't. Is this a normal part of the quitting process or do I need to listen to the easy way again? There's a no moping rule, I'm not moping just trying to figure out if it's normal or not.

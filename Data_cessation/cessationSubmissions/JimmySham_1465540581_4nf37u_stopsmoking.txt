Will the coughing stop?

Hi all, 27 year old 10-20 a day smoker for 10 years here. Coming up to about a month soon of quitting cold turkey and I feel great, only thing is this persistent cough that doesn't seem to go away.

I've heard some say it's good, lungs cleaning out etc. but did you guys have a cough (more tickly than heavy) after quitting, and if so for how long? Cheers

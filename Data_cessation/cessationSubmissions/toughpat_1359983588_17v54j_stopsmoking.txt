Back again -- and my username continues to live up to its original irony...

I'm giving this another whirl.  My last quitting period was Oct 2011-->April 2012.  I started because of the demise of a relationship in which I was quite happy.  The relationship disintegrated, and I was back in the self destruct mode of smoking.

The other day I was checking my reddit mailbox and saw a message that a new fellow nonsmoker had sent to me, and this redditor had noted that he/she was proud of me for making it a year smoke free.  I had realized at that moment that I had never reset my badge or deleted it.  Seeing the badge with the number of days that I would not have been smoking if I had just stuck with it really hit me in the gut.  Felt awful man...

So here I am, back at it.  Cold turkey, using exercise, tea tree oil chewing sticks, and /r/stopsmoking to help with the withdrawal.

Looking forward to the trip with all of you.

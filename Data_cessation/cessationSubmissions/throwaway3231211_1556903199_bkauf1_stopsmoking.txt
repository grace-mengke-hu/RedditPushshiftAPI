I'm losing hope

Have tried to quit so many times using different methods.

The methods that seemed to most effective were Alan Carr and "Urge-surfing." I tried to quit using Alan Carr for over a year now but its not working. I recently tried using a combination of Alan Carr and urge-surfing but I wasn't able to urge surf when the urge came...I feel like something just takes over me and I can't control myself.

I feel so hopeless, this addiction is ruining my life and I don't know what to do.

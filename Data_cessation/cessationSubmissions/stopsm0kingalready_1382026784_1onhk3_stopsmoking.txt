Missed my 1 month but wanted to list some tips

Hi guys! Here is what helped me quit:

* I really, really wanted to quit. I had failed attempts, but none felt as *real* as this one has.

* I read the Carr book and a lot of it really "stuck" with me.

* I posted on here multiple times a day.

* I wrote down (on a physical piece of paper) all of the times I was really stressed but managed to get through it without smoking. It was like a personal achievement guide that I could pull out of my pocket and smile at.

* I got the advice on here to EMBRACE every craving (thanks to the person who shared that tip!), not to push them away. Why does this work? Because it forces you to fall head first into it rather than distracting yourself from what's actually going on.

* I also drank the hell out of some Pepsi during the first week. Remember that you can lose the pounds, but quitting is a lifetime health commitment. It's a commitment to yourself, because you love living and not being a victim to poison rolled up in paper.

* Started working out

* Reminded myself why I was quitting whenever I had a bad craving. And remembered that cravings only last an average of 5 minutes, and that's really not that long.

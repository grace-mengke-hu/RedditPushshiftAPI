Yo-yo effect

I've spent almost all of 2018 in a cycle of quitting for weeks or a month at a time, but then falling off the wagon for a few days and having to repeat the cycle. I just don't understand why I can do the hardest part fairly easily but fail long after the cravings have supposedly gone away. Any similar experiences or advice?

Depression/Anxiety/Anger/Insomnia

All of this. Day 4. I am resolved - firm. I KNOW I am done. But damn, when will this part stop? I have cried like four times today. I never cry. I have started massive arguments with almost everyone I know. I can't sleep. Took a personal day from work today. Any tips/tricks/remedies to help with any of this? Just feeling really hopeless and alone especially when it's nighttime and I've pissed everyone off and now I'm just alone with my thoughts...ugh. Thank you for making this sub at the very least I have this space to rant and it's making me feel a little better. Pack a day smoker for 15 years. My friend's dad is dying of throat cancer as we speak, and I can't bear to think of my kids watching me die like that someday. No more. Just wish the emotional rollercoaster would subside.

UPDATE: I feel much much much better this morning. I think yesterday may have been the worst of it. Put your head down and power through. It gets easier. Thank you all for the encouraging comments.

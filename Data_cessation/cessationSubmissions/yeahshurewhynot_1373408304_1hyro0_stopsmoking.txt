I don't feel like I have a problem but think I should quit smoking

So today was another one of those days for me when you actually realize how long you've been smoking.  For me it's been 15 years and I started at 15.  I was rarely a really heavy smoker.  Majority of the time a pack of cigarettes would last me a week (approx 1-3 a day for 15 years).  In all those years of smoking I probably went a pack a day about 10 times during rough times.  But anyways, 15 years.  Wow, it's really been that long?  

In that 15 years I lost an uncle and my grandfather to cigarettes.  After the funeral I tried to quit each time but, to be honest, I enjoyed smoking.  It's been my go-to-pal as a way to deal with stress since a young adult.  Some of you may suggest working out as an alternative and I already do that.  Running and hitting the bag is a great stress reliever for everyday stress.  But when those real stressful times come along, the kind when your hands are literally shaking from the situation, I just need 15 minutes with my old friend. 

(Bias alert) Honestly I don't feel like it is really an issue.  I maintain a fairly active lifestyle, I don't smoke a lot, and I can quit for months at a time with no real issue.  But still I want to quit, and I have for 6 months at a time, but when I hit a mild to really stressful situation even if I quit for 10 years I know that I will crawl to the end of the world for one.  That's the problem I have right now with quitting.  I've lost hope in any real term change in habit.  What can I do?

TL:DR 

Smoker for 15 years wanting to quit.  I don't feel like I have a problem because I am rarely a heavy smoker.  I enjoy smoking and need it to deal with stress but hate that I am physically, mentally, and chemically dependent on it for stress as well.

Just had my last one...

I've been trying for months to quit and have not been successful. Just started reading all of your posts and they are very inspiring. I just smoked my last one and felt so disgusting and nauseated. Would love some words of encouragement from you guys. I just downloaded the Smoke Free app! 

Thank you all.

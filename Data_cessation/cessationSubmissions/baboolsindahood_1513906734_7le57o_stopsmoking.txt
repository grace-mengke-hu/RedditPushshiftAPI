3 months in and my cravings have come back

I started smoking when i was 19. It started as being a social smoker to 3 packs a week before i quit. I’m now 25. I quit almost 3 months since I’ve quit!! I quit October 1 2017. I was really stressed out before i quit because i was working 70-80 hours a week and i hated everything about it. It was really stressful so i was going through 3 packs a week. I felt so disgusting back then and every time i get cravings i just remind myself of how nasty i felt the days before i quit and how hard it was to quit. I was dry inside out and always had a bloody nose due to the dehydration. I kept throwing my quit day off cuz it was so hard to quit. The first two weeks were hell and then It gradually got better and then i forgot about it. but recently I’ve been having major cravings. I smoked half a cigar (kept it in my mouth) to try and ease the pain but it didn’t help much, i also smoked hooka yesterday and it didn’t help either. I don’t want to rely on alternatives to cigarettes anyway since they all have nicotine in it but i rather smoke a cigar or hooka than a cigarette cuz when i smoke a cigarette i smoke like a chimney. So I’m trying to keep at it and go strong and not smoke anything. I’ve been told the first year is hard so this makes sense but how long will this craving last? It’s been really bad lately, feels like I’m missing a necessity in my life.

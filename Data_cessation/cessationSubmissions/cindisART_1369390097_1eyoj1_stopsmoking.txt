Missed my non smoking cake day!

I smoked a pack and a half a day for 30 years before quitting, and now I feel like I've never smoked.  I never crave them, or think about them.  In fact, the smell of someone smoking makes me feel sick, and I can't get away from them fast enough.  When someone at work comes in from having a smoke, they reek, and they are not even aware how much they stink. Anyway it's been a great year. It's the best thing I've ever done for myself. I kept my subscription to this sub so I could keep track of the one year mark and to encourage others.  Good luck all!

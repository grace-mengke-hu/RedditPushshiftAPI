Tomorrow marks 7 days without smoking cigarettes! 2nd attempt at quitting.. only made it to 4 days last time because of the withdrawal symptoms, but this time around, they aren't as severe. If I can do it, you can do it!

I have smoked regularly since age 18.. so for about 6 years. I always said I wouldn't smoke but just started smoking with my friends, and then needed a pack every other day eventually.. not as bad as some people. Last June, I was smoking up to 12 cigs a day.. :( and so happy that tomorrow I get to say I haven't smoked for a week! 

You all can do it!! Willpower! I quit cold turkey and it's been okay.. have cravings randomly throughout the day still but I drink water or chew gum for the oral fixation. And I ALWAYS used to smoke in my car driving, so getting in the car, realizing I don't have smokes.. is weird.. lol.. and I had empty packs in my car and got rid of those immediately.. they were a trigger to go buy another  pack. ahhh. 

Good luck everyone!

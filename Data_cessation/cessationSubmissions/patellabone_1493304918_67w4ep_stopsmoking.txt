6 weeks in and can't stop coughing

It's been 6 weeks since my last cigarette (cold turkey from about 6 cigarettes/day, 12 years) and about 2-3 weeks after, I started coughing up all the gross stuff. Only thing is the coughing isn't going away. I've quit a few times before and starting coughing up stuff for a bit but it went away and now it's been almost 1 month of coughing (sometimes mucus, but mostly just irritation now). It's at it's worst at night when I'm trying to go to sleep. 
Has anyone else experienced this long period of coughing? Any suggestions? Not sure if I should be seeing a doctor about this or if this is pretty standard...

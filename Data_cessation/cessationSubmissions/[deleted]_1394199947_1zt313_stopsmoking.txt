Smoked for about 10 years, today I try to stop. All tips/tricks are welcome, I'm gonna need all the help and motivation I can get today.

28yo male here, smoked for 10+ years. Once when I was early 20s I stopped for three months, the peer pressure brought me back to smoking. I picked up step one of the patch and a bunch of menthol cough drops, and I have an app on my phone that I think will help. What other tips and tricks can you personally offer me from your experience? Thank you in advance!

EDIT: Thank you all for the comments! I have read through them all more than once and will read through them all again tonight and in the coming days/weeks. I tried to reply to as many as I could. Very helpful community here! I got some great advice and encouragement. I'm more motivated than ever! Going on 9 hours cigarette free now. I've got my app, and thanks to all your help a very promising book to read! My work day is almost over, never thought I could get through a day of work at a *tax office* w/o a cig! I will be checking in frequently and plan on editing and updating this post again soon with my progress. Thanks again everybody!

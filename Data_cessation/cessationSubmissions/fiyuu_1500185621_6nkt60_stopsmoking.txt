Allergy while quitting smoke.

I am a highly allergic person.
I even had low level allergy to smoking too.

So for this 2-3 days i have my most strong allergic reactions in my whole life. I can even hardly breathe sometimes. And not smoked 1 cigarette for 15 days.

Does anybody know can quitting smoke trigger this strong version of allergy for someone who has strong allergies anyway ?

My guess : Bronchial cleaning causes that.

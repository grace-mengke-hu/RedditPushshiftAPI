3 days into this

Hello guys,
This is my first post here, although I check reddit almost daily.
How do you handle the craving? I am a smoker for 8 years, about 1 pack/day, using iqos i've reduced the number of cigarettes for about 6/day and 10 heets/day and 3 days ago I quit both. I am using gums to stop the crave but there are times when only something sweet is stopping the crave. I don't want to get sugar addicted either as I have a case in my family... 
Thank you guys and good luck.

Feeling pessimistic and mad about it

Last week I went 6 days not smoking at all, I had a pack and just sat it up and didnt touch it again. felt confident i was done. smoked one during stress and now I feel like i can’t stop again even though i felt so much better not smoking. i’m just venting really

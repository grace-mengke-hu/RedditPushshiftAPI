Anyone else waking up earlier now?

I have no idea if this has anything to do with quitting or not, but it's the only thing that matches the timeline of my "waking" issue.

I usually only wake up when the alarm clock goes off, but in the past month I've been waking up on my own one to two hours before my alarm goes off.  It doesn't matter how late I stay up or how early I go to bed, if I went to bed sober or had a few drinks.

Is this something other people are/have experienced?

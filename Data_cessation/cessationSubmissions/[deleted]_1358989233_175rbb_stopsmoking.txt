I don't want to smoke any more. There is also a pun within the text (it's not that good).

I don't have conventional cravings, but I do smoke when I drink. I've tried smoking when sober and felt physically ill (I'm happy about that). Over the previous two months I've been running fifteen kilometres a week and boxing and generally not going out too much. This past week I went to a few parties and sure enough I drank and then smoked. It was never an issue, but since the whole working out thing it's starting to really bother me. Now I want to nip this in the butt (fuck yeah, pun!). How should I go about quitting my little habit?

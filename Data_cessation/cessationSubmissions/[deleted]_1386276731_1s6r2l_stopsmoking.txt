I quit over three weeks ago, but...

So I quit over three weeks ago, cold turkey. I was a half-pack a day smoker for around a year, and before that, I smoked 1-5 cigs a day for two years before that. Another thing to note is that I smoke around a gram of weed a day.

I've heard stories about everyone's withdrawals, but since I've quit cold turkey, I've had almost zero encounters where I feel a craving.

Is it because I smoke marijuana? Or do you think I'm just addicted to marijuana, so I don't feel cravings for cigarettes?

Thanks!

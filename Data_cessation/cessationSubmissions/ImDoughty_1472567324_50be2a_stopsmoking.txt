Day 5 of no smokes. Using nicotine patch. Going strong!

I went to the doc last Thursday determined to have a good conversation about quitting.  This time around, I felt more determined than ever.  5 year pack a day smoker here.  To my pleasant surprise the doc told me my insurance covered the patches for FREE.  I know this time around I am quitting for good, so much so that it has made me emotional at times (maybe that's the withdrawal lol).  Sometimes the patches give me a bit of a head rush but I practice deep breathing and carry on with my daily.  Good luck to all my new friends on here trying to quit.  YOU CAN DO IT.  Cigarettes are not that special anyway!

Fourth week and I almost slipped

I almost decided to throw away all my time smoke-free after a shitty day of work. I really thought that 5 minutes of smoking a cigarette would be worth it to take my mind off the anxiety I was feeling. Surely, one slip would just be a drop in the bucket after staying smoke-free for about a month. Nope. If I would have smoked that cigarette, I would have ended up smoking another right after. And then I'd want another one an hour or two after that because "what the hell, today will just be my cheat day". Whenever I rationalize smoking a cigarette, I always snowball back into full blown smoking.

I was able to pause long enough so that I didn't have to smoke a cigarette. A sort of "rule" I set starting out was that I would atleast spend time logging a craving into the smoke-free app or make a post on this subreddit before lighting one up, so I atleast give myself time and read feedback before making a decision. After talking to a buddy about my day at work, I started feeling better. Even though my day sucked, it couldn't be a "failure" because I added another day smoke-free

On cheating.

This is me admitting that I've smoked about three cigarettes in the past 56 days. 

* The first incident, day 32 or so: Bummed cigarette from boyfriend. Took drag. Declared, "What the fuck, boozetent?" Stubbed cigarette out. It tasted gross, but I *wanted* it. Oh man. So much. 

* Second, day 36: At bar. Bummed cigarette from boyfriend. Smoked cigarette. Smoked a second cigarette an hour later on walk home. We were in the large outdoor patio, where everyone smokes, and I caved. Enjoyed them. 

* Third, day 45: Stuck in the country for the weekend. After hours of searching, nicotine desperate boyfriend bummed a rollie cigarette. Took a drag. Ambivalent. 

* Fourth, day 50: Thanksgiving. Stepped outside to share cigarette with housemate. I could feel it in my stomach and lungs. I could smell it. Had to wash hands and brush teeth. Didn't like it. 

I'm not resetting my badge; I consider the part of the process. It's not "56 day without a cigarette" as much as it's "56 days since I committed to quitting cigarettes." (For me. I know it's not the majority opinion here. Not trying to be controversial, just trying to find what works for me. I personally don't find the NEVER TAKE ANOTHER PUFF!!! train of thought helpful... at least, I think I don't.) The Thanksgiving cigarette sort of solidified things for me. Stressed? Have cigarette! And watch it totally *not fix anything*. 

Anyway. If I'm wrong and end up relapsing in a messy heap ([but maybe I'm different!](http://whyquit.com/joel/Joel_04_20_maybe_I_am_different.html)), I promise to be honest about it. 

**Edit:** I just had a hardcore craving from all this typing about cigarettes. But it was gone in less than a minute.

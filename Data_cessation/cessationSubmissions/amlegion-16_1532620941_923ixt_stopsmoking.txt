Guys, I'm getting my 1-week reward tomorrow and I'm super excited!

I chose to get a nice manicure for my 1-week reward, since my hands won't be stained and will actually look nice. I have been using NRT lozenges, but only "as needed" and not 9/day like the box says to. I think they are trying to oversell their product, honestly. Anyway, I made it through yesterday only needing 3 all day. I've been up since 4:30 and have only just now taken my first one. Going to try for 3 again today, or less if I'm doing ok. 

Setting rewards is an important part of making quitting easier. So what are some of your rewards and how often do you choose to reward yourself?

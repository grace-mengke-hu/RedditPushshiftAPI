You CAN do it.

500 days for me. 

I am one who never thought I could do this, yet here I am. EVERY DAY IS EASIER than the day prior and you can take that to the bank.

So go for it. Keep your head high and never puff again. YOU CAN DO THIS.

PS: I ran 9 miles today to celebrate the milestone. A quarter of a mile was not possible for me when I was choking down a pack and a half a day.

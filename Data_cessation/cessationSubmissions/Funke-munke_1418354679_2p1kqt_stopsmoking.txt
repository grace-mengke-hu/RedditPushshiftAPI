Really going to do it this time!

Had soooo many false starts and setbacks but my 17 yr old son and his best friend just told me neither has smoked in three days( my son had his wisdom teeth pulled) we have decided we should all go for it together bc if one smokes the others will bum when having a hard day. I hate myself every time I see my son light up and have a hacking fit.  I am done with this stinking cancer causing disgusting habit! I have two smokes left. Smoking them tonight and then free forever.

anyone smoke a cigarette or two a week?

 I intend to quit smoking tomorrow, that is I don't want to be addicted to nicotine anymore and I don't want to smoke every day. although I will never give up smoking weed atleast once a week, so I figured why quit smoking cigarettes  all together either? of course smoking weed once a week is not hard because its not physically addictive. how hard would it be to smoke one cigarette every 3-7 days? does anyone else here just smoke occasionally? what do you do to keep your mind preoccupied in the mean time, and do you feel as though this has had any significant effects on your health? I used to smoke a pack of cigarettes a day. now I only smoke like 4 or 5 a day. I feel healthier but think I would feel even better if I didn't smoke every day. what do you think?

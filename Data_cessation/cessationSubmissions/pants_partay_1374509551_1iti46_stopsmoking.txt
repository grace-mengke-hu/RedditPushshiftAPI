Smoke an e-cigarette am I doomed!?!?

So I had been smoke free for 7 days, last night I smoked an e-cigarette and could feel the "pleasure" from the nicotine! This has been really hard and im afraid i've undone all this hard work!!! Also I wanted to point out that I got slopy drunk with smokers at a cigarette infested pool hall and did not smoke!!! I was so proud of that but now im worried!!

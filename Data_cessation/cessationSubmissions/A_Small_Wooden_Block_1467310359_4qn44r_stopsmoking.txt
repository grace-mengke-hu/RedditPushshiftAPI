Time to quit looking for some advice.

Well, ive smoked for 10 years and its time to really quit. I'm going to try the path this time (i smoke between 5-8 a day) and cinnamon toothpicks. Any advice or tips or tricks would be awesome. hardest thing for me will be not lighting one up when I'm having the after work beer :(

Herein lies a cautionary tale of relapse (some adult language)

Let me start by saying that I changed my badge this morning. When I logged in, it said I had 203 days. I had previously quit on December 24th, my 4th attempt at quitting, but failed twice to keep it up.



I stopped on Christmas Eve after visiting my grandfather in the hospital. He had gotten radiation treatment almost a year before for throat cancer, but apparently the radiation stuck and was slowly breaking him down. I decided that I never wanted to die on a hospital bed with machines breathing for me, so I quit. Cue bronchitis on December 26th and I figured that it was a sign that it was time for me to stop anyways.



**Relapse number one:** I went strong for about 3 weeks, until late-middle January. I thought, "This is easy! I can have one per day now, because clearly I can quit whenever I want!" Smoking ensued until February 14th. Then, in came a shit storm carried by a cold shit front from the North. February 14th brought in a throat infection. On the 16th, we pulled the plug on my grandfather. On the 20th, we buried him. I see nearly a hundred people in a funeral home and think "nope, smoking is not going to be the reason that this happens to me."



**Relapse number two:** I continue on quitting until 4/20. Meet with some college buddies, do substance abuse, and think "Hey! Clearly I can quit whenever I want, I can afford a smoke or two!" Are you seeing a pattern?



Bam! One night, one pack of cigarettes, back off the wagon. Things go smokingly until May 2nd. I had a few days 'off' because of a cold, but as soon as it passed, I was smoking again. May 2nd, two packs in 6 hours. No real reason, I just liked it. Woke up May 3rd nearly unable to breathe because I'm coughing up all manner of fluids. I think to myself, "This is just because I smoked too much while I probably still had a cold. It's a good thing I'm quitting for sure today." 



Sunday the 4th, wake up and my chest feels like it's throbbing. The walk-in clinics around me are closed, so I tough it out with anti-phlegm cough syrup and Advil. Go to the walk-in on the 5th, the Doc says that it's "Either asthma, inflamed bronchial tubes, or C.O.P.D." 



I say, "What's COPD?" 



He says, "A stop on the way to emphysema" and sends me for a chest x-ray. The x-ray looks clean, apart from some swelling, and the pain and cough-ups pass after about a week. I'm not religious, but I take this as a sign from Cthulu that I dodged one shitload of a bullet. 



So I went from 203 days to, counting today, 73. I have had opportunities to smoke since then, but, thanks to pants-shitting fear, I've avoided cigarettes for upwards of two months. I don't want to come off as self-righteous, or like I'm making a display of this, because the truth is that I'm terrified. Terrified that I'll crack again, or that the damage is done and after two years of smoking (and 22 years of second-hand inhalation), I'm properly fucked. The upside is that, like all of you, it's never going to be too late to quit. I guess the main thing to take away is...



**TL;DR :** Don't wait until you need to be scared off of smoking. And don't let yourself fall in to the trap of "this is easy, I can do this whenever I want!" Also, tell someone that you're quitting. I told my boss and some people I work with (and therefore see every day), so now I have people who can tell me to cut it the hell out if I go for a smoke

Trying to stop, but having an anxiety episode and breathing issues - can anyone help?

Hi,

So a few nights ago I started having breathing issues as in I was shallow breathing and kept thinking I needed big gulps of air to breathe properly but if I calmed myself I could breathe normally. When I started thinking about the breathing, that's when I needed big breaths.

Then two days ago, I read half of that Allen Carr 'How to Stop Smoking' book. Yesterday, I cut my cigarette intake in half but during the day, my shallow breathing thing got worse and I had to leave work early and go to the doctor as I was unable to concentrate and feeling restless and panicky.

He said my oxygen and everything else seemed fine, but he said the top of my ribcage above the breast bone was sore so he gave me Ibuprofen gel to rub on it, but he said to keep smoking at my normal level and wait for the breathing thing to subside. The sore rib cage seems like it's caused by me taking deep breaths and my whole body being twisted and stretching out to breathe in.

Last night I ended up calling NHS Direct (a medical phone line) and spoke to a doctor who said it sounded like I was having an anxiety episode, that I just needed to calm myself down. I managed to do this and had a nice calm night, but it's back today.

I've smoked for 9-10 years (but my parents were heavy indoor smokers before that, so second hand smoke - I've been around smoke for all 24 years of my life).

Can anyone tell me - did you get anxiety when trying to quit? Did you get shallow breathing? I don't know what to do. I've been anxious before but not to the point where it showed physical symptoms and there's nothing in my life to make me feel anxious right now.

Any help would be much appreciated. I wonder if the Allen Carr book has cursed me lmao.

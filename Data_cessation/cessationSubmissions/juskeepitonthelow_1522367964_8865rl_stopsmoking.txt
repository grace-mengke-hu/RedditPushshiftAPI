Just can't stop

Holy fuck, I'm 15 and smoke daily. I know that your probably just thinking ohhh he's not physically addicted but I really am. I would say I've been smoking for 2 years, not constantly though up until this last year. It's horrible I've quit before and it was a breeze but I can't now. I know it's defintaly possible but in all reality I don't want to quit and that's the issue. What am I to Do?

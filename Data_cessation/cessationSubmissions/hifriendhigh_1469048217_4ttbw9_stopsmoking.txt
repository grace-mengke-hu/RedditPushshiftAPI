If you have a severe reaction when you quit smoking, ask your doctor about Bupropion (Zyban)

Smoker for 10 years at 0.5- 0.75 pack a day.

Tried:
Cold Turkey (5 times @ max 3 days)
Smoking a pack in one sitting (until mild seizure @ max 2 days)
Nicotine gum ( 2 times @ max couple hours)
Patch (3 times @ max 30 days)

You can smoke while you are on the Bupropion, but you still have to want to quit. For me they made cigarettes taste like toxic chemicals without any sort of "buzz" or relaxation. I still had urges the first 3 weeks, but they were very mild and manageable. I did not have the level of anxiety while quitting cold turkey or on the patch. 

Side effects for me: Dry mouth, makes me feel spaced out ( i feel dumb and no recall), itchiness while doing cardio (until taking allergy pills)

Let me know if you have any questions! (Also, I am not a medical professional so I only can speak to my personal experience.)

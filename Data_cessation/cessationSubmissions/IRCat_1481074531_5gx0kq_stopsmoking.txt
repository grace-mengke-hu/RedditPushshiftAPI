Only 8 hours in and over it already

Last night I ran out of cigarettes knowing I don't get paid until Wednesday. I'm broke today and couldn't afford cigarettes. I've had the 24hour patches laying around for some time now waiting on a day for me to decide to use them instead of lighting up, so today was that day. I slapped one on and for the first 2 hours I was fine. Didn't have a craving to smoke. The last 6 hours have been pure hell though. I've cried multiple times, I've felt physically ill, and mentally unstable. I've wanted to quit many times but the truth of it is: I love to smoke. I love every part of it, and today has been incredibly hard and it's not even over yet.

I feel like I have two options now: wait out the night and go back to being a smoker tomorrow, or start my journey to become a non-smoker. The second decision is so fucking scary. But on the other hand, I NEVER want to experience what I have gone through today ever again. So does that mean I should suck it up and quit? I don't know guys... this is really hard as I'm sure you know. Just needed to vent. Who knows what decision I will make tomorrow.

It's been slightly over 30 hours since my last cigarette. 

I've used the gum, and lozenges, and I just sprung for a cheap disposable e-cig. 
It may be cheating if I'm not going cold turkey, but, I'm proud of myself.
I'm glad I found a subreddit where I can ask for help and advice if I ever needed it.

@ 200, aka 2000 not smoked

One day at a time, some times one hour at a time. That's how you get this far. For all those just starting out on day one, Hang in there! For those that are trying again, forgive yourself and take the first step. For those that are at a year today, you were at 165 when I started. We're all somewhere on this journey, thank you for helping me on mine!

Quitting Is So Worth It

It's likely that my best friend's grandmother (a smoker) will die in the next few days because of lung cancer. Hearing how much she's suffering in her last days alive is heart-wrenching. I'm almost at 3 months, and for the most part, I don't even think about smoking anymore. Every once in a while, I'll have a fleeting thought that just a few puffs to relax would be nice, but then I remember the hell that I went through the first month. In the first 6 weeks, the depression was terrible, but now, my mental health has never been better. This morning, I ran three miles and only slowed down once in the middle for water. I will no longer have to stand outside in awful conditions (heat waves, blizzards, rain, mosquitoes, etc.) to get my nicotine fix. My skin looks f\*\*king amazing. (Is swearing allowed? I'm not sure. I'm new to reddit.) Anyway, I don't really know where I'm going with this post. I'm sad about my friend's grandma, I wish no one had to suffer like that, but I'm also so proud of all of us quitters. We rock. What are some of your guys' favorite benefits that you've noticed since quitting?

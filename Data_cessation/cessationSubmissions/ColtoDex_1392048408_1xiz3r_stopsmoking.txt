First time poster, 3rd time quitter

Redditors from /r/stopsmoking, you guys are awesome. I just discovered Reddit itself not too long ago, and of course this amazing sub. Been smoking for 14 years now, and it's been bugging me for the last 5. Subconsciously, I've been ready for a while.

After much lurking, I decided to grab the Allen Carr book, see what the hell it was all about (I'm very much a skeptic and I just had to check it).

I finished it last night at 1am. My wife was somewhat surprised when I got out of bed and I said "to have my last smoke ever".

It is Day One. So far, I'm not really thinking about it. The withdrawal is setting in slowly but surely, but to be honest it kinda feels like a mild headache at the moment. Every once in a while I feel like my head is foggy and numb, and when I realize it the feeling kinda dissipates.

I'm not grumpy, but I am kinda getting restless this morning. My brain already makes me remember not the *taste*, but the *feeling* of pulling that first puff after a while... and I force myself to remember the taste, and the -20 degrees Celcius temperature outside at this very moment, and I can't help but laugh :)

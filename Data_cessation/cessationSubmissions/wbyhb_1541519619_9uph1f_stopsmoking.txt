It’s my birthday and 4 month mark!

Smoke free for 4 months and it’s been great! For my birthday I wanted to share with others some tips so that they may succeed as well!

1. Tell your nearest and dearest that you’ll be quitting, prepare them for the worst version of you and ask for support and understanding. I can’t express how instrumental it was that my husband and kids just “shrugged off” my terrible attitude. I wouldn’t have succeeded if I felt like I was hurting them or causing pain. 

2. Plan for the worst of it to last more than 1 month. I thought 3 days/3weeks was a general rule but found it was about a month and a half before it actually became “easier”. You’ll get worn out and have to dig deeper but it’s so worth it! 

3. Find ways to pass the time that make sense for you. Make it personal. Mine was adult colouring books. I loved to color but felt selfish for using my time that way. While quitting, it was like a special treat to color. Find a personally rewarding way to distract yourself. It causes a bit of the same chemical/reward thing in your brain that the nicotine did, if you pick the right activities. 

4. Be ready for smoking family/friends to feel abandoned or hurt. I couldn’t visit my mom and grandma for a few weeks and even after that had to keep the visits short for a while. They thought I was mad at them :( . Luckily they were understanding once I explained how tough it would be for me to be around the smoking at that time. I can imagine if I hadn’t received such an understanding response, it may have seemed easier to continue smoking than to potentially hurt or lose my family.

Stay strong, best of luck to everyone and remember...

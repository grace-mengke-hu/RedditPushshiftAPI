No more nicotine!

I smoked a 1/2 pack a day for 10ish years, and tried to quit several times.  I always felt like shit and I couldn't bike or ski as hard because I was always out of breath.  When I finally quit cigs, I started vaping at 3mg(of nicotine) and quickly moved to 1.5mg.  After nearly 100 days w/o a cig, I can say I am now officially nicotine free!  I switched to 0mg juice yesterday, and I feel great.  I feel like my vape made it way easier to quit- I never made it past 2 weeks in previous attempts.  I assume the vaping will become less and less frequent after I get used to the 0mg.  Heres to clean lungs!

Never been so scared because of a dream.

Today in the middle of the night i woke up in cold sweat because in my dream I saw that I was smoking. I woke up and almost broke down because I did not realize right away that it was just a dream and thought that I actually smoked and ruined my streak and was very relieved when I realized that it was just a dream. This how strongly I programmed myself not to smoke that even smoking in my dreams makes me feel horrible. For all of you strugling to quit smoking i can tell what works for me (To be honest I have not had any strong cravings yet):

 

* Hit the gym, hit it hard at least 3-4 times a week.
* Pick up a hobby that distracts you, in my case it is Kick Boxing
* Meditate (Doesn't mean sit in lotus position, there are many types of meditation).
* Drink a lot of water

Threw sigarettes away

I was clean for seven years.  And started smoking again about a year ago.  I hated my job,  just cut off contact with my parents and felt like crap.  

Well after smoking more than a pack a day,  last six months I finally threw away my last sigarettes 5 minutes ago.  I'm sick of it.  Been meaning to do this for at least a month now.  So here it goes.

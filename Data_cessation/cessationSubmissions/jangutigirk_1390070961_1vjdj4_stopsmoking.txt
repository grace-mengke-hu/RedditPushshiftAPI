One month!

It's been a month since I quit cold turkey. The first week was hard. The cravings were horrible, but between you fine people here and my stop smoking app, it got easier. 
I was a smoker for 11 years, and it was time to stop. 
I just want to thank everyone for their encouragement. And I want to tell everyone that is quitting that it can be done. It gets easier. 
Cheers!

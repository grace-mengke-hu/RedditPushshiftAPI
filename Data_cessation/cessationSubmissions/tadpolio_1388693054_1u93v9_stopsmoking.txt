Watching people smoke on t.v

I have been obsessed with American Horror Story and they are always smoking.  It makes cravings flare up but I feel like it actually helps because I am "around" it with out actually having to smell it. I still haven't gotten to the point where I can stand being around people smoking. Anybody else feel this way?

Ten days and going strong

Just thinking out loud - 

Well I relapsed once on my fourth day. I was drunk, bought a pack of cigs, smoked two on the spot and threw away the rest. I decided not to reset my clock. And I guess it kinda worked for me. I don't crave cigarettes that much anymore. I feel like I've brainwashed myself to the point I would find the smell of smoke on the street repulsive, although sometimes it would make me want one. Oh, and the biggest trigger for me is when I see people smoke on screen. I guess it has to do with the strong association between "coolness" and cigarettes I've had since I was young. Seeing Brad Pitt smoke definitely makes me want to smoke haha. 

I feel like using the iPhone app and reading encouraging lines helped me a lot for the first couple days when I was still physically addicted to nicotine. But I find it triggering now as it only reminds me that I had quit, cuz I could carry out a whole day without giving it much thought, so why remind myself what I'm missing out on in the first place. 

What I realized the most throughout this process is how you have to make yourself believe first before you can get yourself to do something. What I call "brainwashing" myself really is motivating yourself with a level of confidence/trust you haven't quite earned yet for yourself. 

Anyways, I am proud of myself for making it this far, and I can really see myself quitting for good this time. Not another puff no matter what!

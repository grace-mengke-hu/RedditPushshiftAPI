Just had my last cigarette using Allen Carr’s method. One question.

Just finished Allen’s book after being afraid to finish it for over a year.  My excitement is through the roof. I just smoked my last cigarette ever!

Would like some clarification or feedback though on something I either missed or was not present in the book...

Do I start telling people (mainly my wife, a non-smoker) that I’m done? Or do I hold off, let them notice on their own and surprise them with my accomplishment when they ask?

Either method is exciting. Telling them outright or letting them find out on their own. But following Allen’s method wasn’t clear on this point.  If it was in the book and maybe I breezed over it too quickly, could someone point out the chapter for me?

Sorry if this has been asked and answered already in this subreddit already. But I had to tell someone at least.

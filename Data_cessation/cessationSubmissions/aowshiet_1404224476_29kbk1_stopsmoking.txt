I'm quitting today - rock bottom story

Well, I've hit rock bottom. This spring I had a bad breakup with a girl. Really bad. Since then, I've been masking the pain by smoking a shit ton of cigarettes and drinking a lot of alcohol. My main hobby these couple of months have been to procrastinate. I've failed school pretty hard, and I am convinced that I need to start taking care of myself if I am to get out of this shit. 
I am also completely broke. I barely have money for anything, let alone to kill myself by smoking.  

I will probably feel like even more shit the following week, but I'm sure its all worth it in the end. 
I threw away all my cigarettes and my lighter. My plan is to quit cold turkey, and I will not use any substitutes, nor will I binge on food/candy or other unhealthy shit. 
Currently, I have the flu. I'm sure I wouldn't have caught it if I hadn't smoked. 

Just wanted to share. Good luck to me.

Hear I go again.

Hey guys and gals, I'm new here, and trying to quit again.I'm pretty much using this post as a vent, hope that's ok.So last year, new years day, I quit smoking. It wasn't intentional, I don't do New Years resolutions, it never works, but I woke up (slight hangover) and just decided to not to have one. This went on for over 6 months, "fuck" I thought, "how can people find this so difficult?" Somehow over the course of a night, my body and mind had decided that I was no longer a smoker, so easy it was that it was like I never smoked before, I wasn't an ex-smoker, I just didn't smoke.I went to a big music festival in June, and drank... And unfortunately slipped up and smoked too. I was a smoker once more."It's ok, I did it before I can do it again." Ahh I wish I never said those words, along with "waiting for the write time." I'm on my 3rd day today, and it's easing up, a little.Man, I wish I never slipped up. I had the completely right mindset, I was doing it for one reason, and one reason only... ME. That was my trick, I truly wanted to stop, I wasn't told to, wasn't doing it for someone else, I was doing it for me. I was roped into a new sport (sailing) and it was very competitive, and I realised how unfit I was, and something had to change.Sorry for rambling, I'm at work, and getting itchy. Just needed to write something.Good luck to everyone else quitting, and well done to those that have.Edit: Sorry about the hear, quitting brain, or maybe just my phone.

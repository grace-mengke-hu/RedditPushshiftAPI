Quitting today

I have been trying for a couple of days but keep relapsing at night. I have been smoke free for 6 month before when i had my back surgery doctor told me coughing will bring back your back pain but went right back to smoking after feeling better and now i really wanna leave this habit and focus on better things to do ill keep you guys updated and when i get craves Iâ€™ll definitely post here since people around here are soo much helpful thank God for Reddit. Going to bed now Good luck to me

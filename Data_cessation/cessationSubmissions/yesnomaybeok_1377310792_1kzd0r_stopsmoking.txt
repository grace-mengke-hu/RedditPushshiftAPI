E-cigarettes question??

Hello,
I quit smoking last year for about 10 months (cold turkey) but after my gf broke up with me I went back to the crappy habit. Now I'm ready to quit again since I  started dating a girl who doesn't like smoke and I am ready for a change as well.
To be honest, for some reason, I am very scared of quitting this time...

Anyway, have any of you guys tried e-cigarettes? Did it help? What are your experience with them? Do you recommend any brands? Do you recommend them at all? Did it help you?



Thanks

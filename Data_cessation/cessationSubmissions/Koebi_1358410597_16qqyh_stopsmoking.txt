Broke my knee.

Quit smoking.

Hi guys

So, last saturday I took an arrow to the knee.  
Or rather, a 2m drop, landing full-on on my patella, which broke into 5 pieces.

While waiting for the ambulance I smoked a cigarette.  
Got to the hospital, got surgery, lots of morphine and whatnot.

After 2 Days, I really wanted to go outside to drag on a stick, but merely getting up and walking to the toilet on crutches is like a marathon and a big bucket of pain for me atm.  
So I didn't.

Left the hospital yesterday and I have a few months of healing in front of me, but I still haven't touched these devils, so I decided to stop once and for all, after smoking 10-20 cigs a day for almost 5 years (I'm 23).  
Especially after hearing that smoking decreases bone healing by a whopping 50%!!

So here's to my broken patella.

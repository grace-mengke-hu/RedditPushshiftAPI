Scared to quit

Basically the only reason why I dont want to quit is the weight gain and also depression. I tried quitting last month for a week and after 6 days I was so depressed. I can’t even describe it. I cried on my way home I cried on my way out with friends. I cried at home and I didn’t even know why I just had the urge to cry. After 6 days I felt so miserable that I went outside and lit a cigarette. After that one cigarette I instantly felt better also ashamed that I smoked but I felt better almost happier. I know it probably sounds like bullshit and another stupid reason not to quit. I’m just really scared of feeling like that again.

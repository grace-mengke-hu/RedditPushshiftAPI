Just took my first breath as a non smoker ... again

This is another attempt to quit and im determined to make my last

Ive smoked through the hardest times emotionally in my years and its the last addiction from that time that still hangs around, letting go of this is my final piece to move forward to new brighter things. Im finally happy to say im ready.

This community has done so much for my mentality.

Thank you all

Cheers to breathing healthier!

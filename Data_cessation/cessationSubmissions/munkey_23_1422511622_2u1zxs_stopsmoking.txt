Getting through withdrawals.

I smoked earlier in the day, but I wanted to see how I felt without smoking. Several hours later though, I suddenly realized I could not focus at all, and I was getting incredibly irritated, as well as emotional. I feel really fragile. For those that have quit, does that withdrawal feeling stick with you continuously for a while? I think I need to have a plan in place to do this. I really want to be done with this, and being toward the end of grad school and finishing a thesis isn't helping matters. I just have to keep going.

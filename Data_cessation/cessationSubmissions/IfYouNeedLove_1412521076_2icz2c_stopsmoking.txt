Strange habit formed from my quitting

So it's been almost 60 days since I finally quit smoking, and I feel absolutely amazing. I have noticed though that I've formed a terrible habit during this time though, and that is teeth grinding and jaw clenching. Whenever I get a craving, a pang or think about cigarettes I tend to clench my jaw. It's at a point where by the end of the day my jaw hurts from the strain. I wonder if anyone else has experienced something similar, and if so, what they've done that helps! I know it sounds so trivial, but I just hope I'm not the only one.

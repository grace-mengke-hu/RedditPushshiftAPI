Weekends + booze

This Saturday will be one month of not smoking. It’s actually not hard for me UNLESS I’m drinking. I haven’t been drinking really the past few weeks. I know this weekend I will be drinking a lot and the thought of drinking without smoking is making me really depressed. Like it won’t be as much fun. I’ll just be thinking about them. So do I even bother drinking? I don’t know. Any advice?

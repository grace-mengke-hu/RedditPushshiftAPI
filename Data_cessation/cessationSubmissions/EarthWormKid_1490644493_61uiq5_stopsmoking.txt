Day 1! (I Hope)

Yesterday, I smoked the last butt in my pack right before bed. Today, I decided not to go pick up another pack and really try to quit. I quit last Summer and was doing well, but fell back into it when I started working with a chain-smoker. I've been wanting to quit for a while now, but keep finding excuses (a new job interview, a long car ride, depression, etc..). 
I'm so sick of smoking though! I can't think about how much more money I'd have saved up if I didn't smoke. I'm tired of hiding it from my family because they think I quit several months ago. I'm sick of the butts and ash piled up on my window sill. I'm sick of how my chest feels after I smoked too much, or how stuffy my nose is and how heavy my breathing is. I hate having a sore throat and swollen tonsils more often than I should. I hate how difficult it is to run or do other cardio now. I'm scared to wind up with heart disease or lung cancer because I keep putting it off. I'm only 22, but the sooner I quit the better. 

Despite all of this, I really, really, really want to hop in my car and buy a pack. Even if I make it through today, will I be able to keep myself from stopping at a corner store on my way home from work? I hope I can make it stick this time! :)

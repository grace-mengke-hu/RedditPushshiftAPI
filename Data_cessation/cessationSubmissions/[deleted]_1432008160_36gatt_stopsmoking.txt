Starting a project with some friends that we hope will help make quitting easier. We would love your feedback!

After talking with some ex-smoker friends, we decided to start a "quit smoking" themed monthly subscription box so that we can make it easier for others to quit. It's going to have the essentials (refillable water bottle, hard candy, mints) as well as stuff to keep busy (origami, stress balls, puzzles). We are new to this and need all the feedback we can get to make it a reality!
 

What are your thoughts? Do you think a monthly "quit box" is a good idea? Would you be interested in something like this for yourself or a friend? What do you think should go in the box? What would be a reasonable price for such a box?
 

We got the idea because my friend would receive care packages from his (long distance) girlfriend full of misc. things to motivate him to quit smoking, so we thought it would be a good way for others to get their loved ones to quit without being annoying :)

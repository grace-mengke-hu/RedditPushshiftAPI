I have one more cigarillo, and i cant afford to keep smoking.

I have tried quitting many times, gum, lozenges, even used various e cigarettes, and I always start smoking again.

My biggest trigger is stress (usually financial) and now i cant afford cigarettes, so i am being forced into quitting again.

I want to quit, but have just never been able to get 100%. What are some stress relief techniques you guys have used so I can make the best of this (hopefully) final attempt?

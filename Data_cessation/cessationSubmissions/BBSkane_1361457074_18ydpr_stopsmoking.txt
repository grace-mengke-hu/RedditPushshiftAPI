Turning 35 on Sunday, time to give myself the best present I can think of, a cigarette free life. 

I have been a smoker since I was 15, and since college it has been a pack a day habit. 

As I get older, I am realizing what restrictions this habit has placed on my life. But I have tried quitting in the past, and never made it past the next cigarette really. 

So many of you here have managed to kick this habit, and I guess I am turning to you for support and any guidance you will offer. 

I do have one question, I do enjoy the occasional (see almost daily) puff of trees, and want to ask any other ents who quit, did you have to give up bud for a certain amount of time? 

Wish me luck, my quit date is the 24th of February, the day I turn 35.

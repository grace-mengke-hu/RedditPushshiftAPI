1.5 packs a day for 15 years. Now 8 months free. Here's how I did it.

I am not implying in any way that this is the best, easiest, or most effective way to do it. This is merely what worked for me after several failed attempts to quit. I thought I should share my experience after discovering this subreddit in the hopes that it inspires others to quit as well.

**How it feels now:** I feel awesome. I feel free and more energetic. I also have a little extra cash every day to save or treat ma self. I don't stink and disgust people around me specially my SO. It is clearly the best decision I took in my life and I regret not taking it sooner.

**History:** I used to smoke around a pack and a half a day for 15 years.

**Motivation:** My declining health and stamina to an alarming degree was one of the major reasons, like my inability to do simplest physical efforts like going up the stairs or playing frisbee. The discomfort and stink I was causing to those around me was another. As a PhD student not making much money, this was a major issue as well.

**Methodology:** I previously tried quitting cold turkey and it didn't work for me, I truly respect the willpower of those who were able to quit cold. First  I started counting how many I smoke per day (around 32) and I reduced my consumption gradually over a month. Then I broke smoking down to two addictions and dealt with one at a time, nicotine addiction and psychological habit addiction. I started smoking nicotine free e-cigarettes, although I am unsure what health risks they pose I was pretty determined to quit and thought hey maybe its not as much as the chemicals I smoke daily anyways. They truly helped ease the transition and came with some perks such as smoking inside some buildings and being stink free, although they feel very weird and uncomfortable to smoke. After a few weeks, and by overcoming the nicotine addiction, I started reducing the habit. This was pretty much easier since e-cigarettes were uncomfortable to smoke anyways and the vapor felt like it was condensing in my lungs forming fluids or something. They actually made me hate smoking them. And then I was [free](http://i.imgur.com/JHfYqUN.png).

**Notes:** The hardest addiction for me was in fact the habit not the substance dependence. That smoke with the morning coffee or weekend liquor is the most difficult thing to give up. Having a supportive environment truly helps, like friends, family, or even strangers who understand exactly what you are going through like on this subreddit. Your health doesn't magically get better, it takes time and exercise. I still am not back to my full capacity yet after 8 months. Don't let this turn you off or discourage you, in fact I keep wondering what my health would've been if I added 8 months of smoking instead of subtracting, truly frightening.

Now go set yourself free. Do it your own way, at your own pace, however it may feel right, and fucking commit. You will reap the rewards, slowly but surely.

Two week club!

Sitting here at work in the hospital, downtime and all, and I'm proudly celebrating two weeks nicotine free! It's incredible how easy the cravings become - I rmemeber at 48 hours where I was pacing around anxiously for 10-20 minutes at a time. Not today, I get the occasional pang that I literally can just shake off like I got a splash of water in the face.

Been awhile since I was able to quit in such confidence, and the few times I've had a strong urge to smoke, I always looked back at this subreddit and (as silly as it sounds) took a little pride in my little token that showed how many days I've gone so far.

Thank you all, and this feeling is absolutely amazing!

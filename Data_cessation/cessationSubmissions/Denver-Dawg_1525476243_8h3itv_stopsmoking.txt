30 days quit today... again!

I'm getting pretty good at this quitting thing.  If only someone was hiring a quit smoker with many years of experience.  My partner and I both quit together and are using the nicotine patch. We dropped down to step 2 a little early but this seems to be just fine with us this week. No whammies!

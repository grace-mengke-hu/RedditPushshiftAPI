Any longtime smokers have quit stories, advice?

I'm 42 & used to smoke 10-15 cigs a day since I was a teenager.  Well...   off & on (mostly on) since I did quit when I was pregnant - but I stupidly started up again afterwards.  

I remember when I started smoking.  No problem, I told myself, I won't get addicted. If I ever got up to a pack-a-day habit, then I'd quit! Obviously anything less was not a true addiction, at least that's how my mind rationalized it.

I was doing the math a while ago...  I've been a smoker for about 25 years.  I have spent over half my life poisoning myself!  That's just fucking scary! I knew I needed to quit & I really wanted to quit; but I lacked the tools & motivation to actually stop.  

Then I stumbled across this sub.  I still wasn't ready to stop but I added Stop Smoking to my favorites. Your stories would pop up in my news feed in between the cute cat pictures and other miscellany and eventually you grew on me. All of you are in various stages of Quit & supporting each other in the process.  It made the idea of quitting a lot less scary. 

I made my declaration yesterday & here I am today, trying to type away my addiction.  LOL.

Any long-term (ex)smokers with successful quit stories care to share & offer their advice?  I'd love to hear about your experience.

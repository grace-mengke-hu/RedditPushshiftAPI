Day 1

So after being 200 days smoke free I relapsed while out drinking and before I knew it I was caught again. Now after being back to 10 a day for a couple months I've finally hit my breaking point. So I just went out and spent $25 on tobacco after having not had any all day and as soon as I had that first smoke I was disgusted with myself and what I was doing. I grabbed all the tobacco, in my hand, I had bought and threw it out into the garden. I'm done, I'm sick of being sick all the time (I have a bad immune system anyway). I've requested another badge because I know I'm not a smoker anymore.

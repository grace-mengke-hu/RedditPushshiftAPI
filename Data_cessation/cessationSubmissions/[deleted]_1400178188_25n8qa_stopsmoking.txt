Yeah...I need to stop smoking.

I haven't been smoking for long, only about three months. I'm 21 years old, seeing my dad smoke and seeing the effects of his body made me promise myself I'd never do it but after a serious mental breakdown I started. I was willing to try anything to make myself feel better and the main perpetrator of my breakdown? Well it pissed them off all the more that I smoked that just motivated me all the more.

I only smoke about 6 a day. I don't buy them, I nick my dads. He's been smoking for about fifty years now so doesn't notice when I take them. I'm on anti-depressants and smoking has become a sense of comfort for me I guess, but I still feel dirty whenever I do it. I hate the smell, hate the fact that i'm reliant but at the same time its reassurance and gives me a release. I've tried exercise but I just end up feeling like an idiot for being a sweaty mess.


Please help.

Quit smoking on father's day...thanks to info from Reddit

I am 34, smoked since I was 16.  For the past 10 years I have smoked around 1 to 1.5 packs per day.  Parliament Lights 100's.  I needed to quit because of several reasons that you all know and can relate with.  I tried EVERYTHING.  Chantix 3 times, patches, gums, hypnosis, cold turkey, locked in a room, and nothing worked.  I was reading this forum and saw some people mention vaping.  Now hold on.....I know people on here are pro-vaping - but it has worked for me!  I am proof!  I have never gone this long without a single cigarette since I was 16.  Vaping is not quitting nicotine - but it is quitting cigarettes and I'll take that win for now!  My clothes don't smell and I can breathe, eat, sleep, and feel overall much better about myself.  Of course I will work to wean myself off the nicotine while continuing to vape, but please listen - if you really want to quit and have tried EVERYTHING, GIVE THIS A SHOT!!!  Even if you continue to vape for a year, it costs less than $10 a month (for me anyway) vs. $400 a month.

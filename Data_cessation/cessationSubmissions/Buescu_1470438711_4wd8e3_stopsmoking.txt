48 Hour quitting summary

I've been a smoker for 10, 11 months (a pack a day) and been trying to quit for 4 months, give or take. 48 hours is the longest I've been without smoking since december, probably. I started at midnight 2 days ago exactly.
0h-18h: Nothing too harsh, spent most of the time sleeping.
18h-24h: Really difficult, had to pour all my willpower to make these 6 hours.
24h-29h: Could not sleep at all (midnight-5am) Really wanted to smoke. Finally got some zzz's after five hours of unrelentless withdrawal symptoms.
29h-36h: zzz....
36h-40h: Mild withdrawal symptoms, went for a half hour run and stopped it.
40-48h: Was around heavy smokers all this time and had my subconscious gnawing for a smoke. I could feel the tobacco smell from 10m distance. Resisted it. Food and beverages tasted a lot better during these hours.
Well, since I've written this, it's 48h 15 min (nearly) since my last smoke! I'd love feedback! This reddit has helped me during this time!

Rarely talked about benefits of quitting.

Hey guys, first post here. Been a 2-3, as much as 4 packs a day smoker for 9 years and quit cold turkey one day bcause i decided i didnt want to smoke anymore. Quit for about 2 months, but been back at it for a few months(mistake!) Anywho, we all know it causes cancer, is expencive, heart disease, blah blah blah, but most of us continued to smoke anyway. My question is, what odd things, or surprising things you have noticed after a few months of being smoke free? I have several. After a month or so, my speach slowed way down. I didnt talk at the speed of light any more and didnt feel the need to rush anything any more and was much more sure of my words and wasnt questioning everything i said. I also didnt drink as much water. Before i quit i drank sssoooo much water, bottled water was costing me alot of money and was almost becoming a problem. After i quit i only needed a few small bottles a day, as compared to the 10-15 before. Sex was MUCH MUCH better! My dickwas A LOT harder, way more veiney(sorry if TMI!) And just felt more alive, by far the best benefit. So what about you guys? Any odd, weird, surprising, or rarely spoken of REAL WORLD benefits that dont revolve around medical/money reasons? Lets give people real reasons to quit, not just the usual stuff.

Here we go!

I've been smoking for 14 years, which is just under half my life. Finished Alan Carr's book while smoking my last cigarette about 10 minutes ago. I'm a little scared, but mostly I'm just excited to be done smoking these goddamn things. Wish me luck guys, I'm planning on checking in a lot over the next few days.

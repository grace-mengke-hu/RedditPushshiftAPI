I found an excuse

I found an excuse to start smoking again a month ago and even though it’s like 3 cigarettes a day I’m still ashamed of myself.

I only made it to 8 days before I smoked and I remember that it was really easy to NOT smoke at that time. Now I find it even more difficult than before to quit. 

This is not a pity party, I’m more wondering what to do now. Obviously yes, quit smoking. But what are some things to do to make it stick?

Had another dream about smoking last night

I was with some friends, and decided to light one up "just for the hell of it". I think I may have finished about half of it before I dropped it on the ground and snuffed it out with my shoe.  
  
I remember being distraught over having to reset my counter, and how it definitely wasn't worth it. I'm glad it was just a dream, and that my subconscious mind doesn't even like smoking anymore.

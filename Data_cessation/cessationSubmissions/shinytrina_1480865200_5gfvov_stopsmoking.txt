A bit over 24 hours in and I am dying

So I woke up this morning a bit over 24 hours since my last cigarette with a headache and there was this feeling in my chest that there was something there that I should be able to cough up but could not.   Is this natural?  Does this get any better?  I feel like my body is shutting down right now.

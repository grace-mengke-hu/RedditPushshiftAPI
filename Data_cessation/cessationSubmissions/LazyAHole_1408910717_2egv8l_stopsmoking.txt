6 Months!

Just realized, it has been 6 months of me not smoking cigs!

I have never really visited the community in the past couple of months and I have finally stopped getting the urge to smoke! Thanks for getting me started [to-quit-smoking] ! :D

P.S. : However, leaves are still my poison! [However, I am pretty comfortable and in control]

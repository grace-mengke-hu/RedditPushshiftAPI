Horribly sick with bronchitis, never again will I smoke

I was a pack-a-day smoker for the past 2 years. It was a dumb habit to pick up, especially since I'm 22 and should have known better. I've had asthma since I was a kid. The last time I felt this shitty I was 11 and hospitalized for strep and asthma. It sucks not being able to breathe.

Well I'm 2 days cigarette free (sick for more like 4 days) and I decided enough is enough when I'm gagging down my cigarettes trying to breathe and to not vomit in horribly freezing winter weather. What sane person would keep up after that?? 

Shit aint worth it. Especially when a simple chest cold probably got this bad cuz of my smoking habits. My asthma hadnt shown itself in a decade before this. 

Hopefully I can hang onto this shitty feeling when I'm healthy again. Ima try my best ðŸ¤’

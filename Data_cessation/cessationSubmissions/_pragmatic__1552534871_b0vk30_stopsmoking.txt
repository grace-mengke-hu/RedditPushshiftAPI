Smoke free for 5 years! But I'm more addicted to nicotine than ever after 5 years on nicotine gum...

My good news? I'm completely smoke free. The thought of a cigarette now disgusts me. I'm in a great place vis Ã  vis cigarette use.


However, I quit using nicotine gum.  I used the gum as the patches didn't work for me. Something about the chewing helped a lot.


Ever since, I've just gone to town on the gum like they were candy.  I probably chew 20 pieces a day (80mg nicotine all up) so I'm probably *more* addicted to nicotine today than I was when I smoke.


I'm planning on switching to patches, along with sugar free regular gum.


For patches, I'm thinking I'll initially wear 2 x 20mg patches. Then drop to 20mg + 10mg. Then 20mg. Then 10mg. Then done.


What do you think?


Or should I just drop the nicotine replacement therapy altogether and see if it sticks?

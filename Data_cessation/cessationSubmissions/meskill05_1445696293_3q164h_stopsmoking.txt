Hello, going on day 4 smoke free just looking for extra support.

Hi,
Going into day 4 of being smoke free, using my vape with very little nicotine when having extreme urges to take the edge off, after smoking for 33 yrs and numerous attempts to quit and failed. I really want to succeed this time, so just thought I'd stop here looking for Lil extra support, don't have much support at home.
Thanks.

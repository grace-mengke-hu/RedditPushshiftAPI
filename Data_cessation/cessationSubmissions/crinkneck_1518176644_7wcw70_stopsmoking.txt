Fitbit tracking your improvements after quitting - another motivator!

I've been a regular Fitbit user since 2013. Gotta get those steps in! But, two weeks into my post-cigarette life, I'm starting to see awesome positive changes in the Fitbit data.

1) Resting heart rate is down about 10bpm. It took months of regular exercise to see that big of a change when I was a smoker

2) Heart rate recovery greatly improved. I do a lot of interval cardio, and can get my heart up to 170bpm in the intense stages. One minute after downshifting to the easier interval, my heart recovers to 125bpm now. As a smoker, it would only go down to 150bpm in that time frame and wouldn't even get down as low as 125 before the next intense interval began. 

3) Sleep quality improving, too! I've always been a bad sleeper. Tossing and turning, and regularly awoken in the middle of the night. Now, I can see that I'm staying in the REM cycle parts of the sleep much, much longer, and I'm waking up a lot less. I'm not getting more sleep, but much higher quality.

Just thought I'd share my observations! Fitness tracker can be a good tool to keep motivated as you quit, and it's another good way to visualize the improvements your body is making.

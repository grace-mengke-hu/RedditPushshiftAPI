New to this subreddit, I have a genuine cold turkey vs. electronic cigarette question

I have been smoking now for about a year and a half, and I smoke about a third of a pack a day now. I've always been wanting to quit especially since I have been smoking without my significant other knowing. She just confronted me about it few hours ago, in a very calm way that she just wants me to live longer and not be dependent on something.

I have tried quitting multiple times cold turkey with no success. I've gone about 10 days without smoking and then I'd go to bars with my friends and would habitually light one up.

Here's where the question comes. The electronic cigarette seems to have a lot of variety - some that includes nicotine, and some that does not. I tell myself that the addiction right now is to the habit and "filling the time," rather than nicotine, but I am not sure if that is a brutally honest statement.

So here I am, considering again to quit, and I would like to know every information about cold turkey vs electronic cigarette. My family would be supportive of me sporting a electronic cigarette if that is the only way.

**TL:DR **- Which way would you recommend? Does quitting using electronic cigarette actually help? or does that transfer your addiction to the vapors?

by the way, I am loving the subreddit, and I am very impressed with you guys for quitting.

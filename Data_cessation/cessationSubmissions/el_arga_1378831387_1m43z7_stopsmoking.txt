Kicked some of my triggers! :D

Unsubscribed from pretty much all other subreddits. The mods at r/drugs were awesome, and banned me at my request, because I couldn't stop going over there, and that was probably my biggest trigger on reddit. 

I'm going to be cleaning my room, and getting rid of all the triggers in here soon. 

I'm doing this the right way this time. I will not slip up. I can't.

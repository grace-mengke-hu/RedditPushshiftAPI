Chest pains 5 months after quitting, is this normal?

The title pretty much says it all. I never dealt with chest pains while I smoked, which was for about 5 years, but I've recently been dealing with relatively debilitating sharp chest pains in the past few weeks. 

I'm wondering if this is normal so long after quitting smoking?

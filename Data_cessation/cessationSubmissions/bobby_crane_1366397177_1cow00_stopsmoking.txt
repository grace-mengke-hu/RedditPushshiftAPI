As a new non-smoker going into the weekend...

I am nervous. Today is day 5 and I've done great so far. I know I'm going to want to revert to old habits this weekend, but I'm going to fight through each and every craving as they come. I wish all of you non-smokers luck this weekend and let's continue to work toward being new, healthy people and to support each other!

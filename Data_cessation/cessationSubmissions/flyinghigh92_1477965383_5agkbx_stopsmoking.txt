Comparing life outlooks

With current stats as either a non smoker or a smoker as I ponder turning 25 in some months. Want to be free like a peaceful free by then. The space in between the bars is priceless yet precious life wasted by smoking including the time it takes to smoke and every moment in between when you wish you could. Time = the only true currency in our lives. Tobacco = worthless life. Badge is wrong the bitch still has me...

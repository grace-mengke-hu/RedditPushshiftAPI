It amazes me..

It amazes me how much smoking has infiltrated every little facet of my life. I live in Michigan, and today truly is one of the best weather days of the year, summer is truly here and it is apparent today. But scumbag brain is reminding me how good it feels to be outside in the sun, with a cigarette. Or driving with the windows down listening to awesome summer-is-here music ( in this case polyphonic spree :) ) , and thinking how much better this feeling would be with a smoke. Ugh. 

Here's to a lifetime of re-experiencing the nuances of life, smoke free !

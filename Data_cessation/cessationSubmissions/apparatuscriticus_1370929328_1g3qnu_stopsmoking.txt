It's not like I don't want to

I keep feeling like I'm still a smoker. I'm just not smoking. Part of me wants to be a smoker still. And to kill that part of me, would be to kill one of the few things I have left in this world.

When I crave, I breathe. I wake up to it and drink coffee with it. I play games and deal with the emotional stress of being with someone that I love so much but is deeply hurt emotionally. Constantly being triggered I just close my eyes... *and breathe*.

Why won't I stop thinking about it. What was so damn good about putting myself in harms way... when we think of people cutting themselves we cringe inside. As if smoking is any different!

I'm doing it! I'm really fucking doing it! I haven't had a cigarette in ages! This is the feeling that keeps me going. I'm proud of myself. I feel better and once the craving subsides, I'm okay. I don't need them. I don't need them.

**I don't need them.**

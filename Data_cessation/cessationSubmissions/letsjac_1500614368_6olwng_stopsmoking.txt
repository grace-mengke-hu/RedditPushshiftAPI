6 months clean and free

I never thought I would be able to get free. Now I just realized I'm coming up on 6 months. I've had give or take 3 cravings in all after the first month and there is not a day has gone by that I have missed nicotine or tobacco. IT FEELS SO GOOD TO BE FREE! That you to everyone who inspired me! It feels so good to be alive and to respect myself and my choices again!

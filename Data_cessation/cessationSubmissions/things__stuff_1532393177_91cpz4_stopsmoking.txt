The Feeling That A Craving Brings...

......Is kind of intense. Does anyone else feel sluggish, kinda sad, and just generally a bit more "blah" when quitting? I'm having a hard time here on day 3. I'm starting a new job tomorrow, and there are also heavy family issues happening in my life right now. Even though I've been using nicotine replacement (e-cig), I don't think it's really working to ease the cravings - I feel like it's making them worse? I want a cigarette right now in some kinda way, as if my entire body is speaking out to me: "DO IT, YOU KNOW YOU NEED IT"!!!! Even though my body is talking to me, intellectually I know that if I cave, it will only serve to make me feel physically even MORE shitty than this feeling is currently making me feel. So I'm trying to remind my body: "Hey! Calm the fuck down. Breathe. You can do it, and then you're going to feel AWESOME once you get out of this spell!" 

...I know it will pass! I'm so grateful that I can come here to vent a little! Thanks for reading.

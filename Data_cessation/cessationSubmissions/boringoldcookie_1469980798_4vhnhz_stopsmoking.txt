Ayyyyy I made it a little over a year! Come cheers with me or AMA

Aside from the random craving maybe once every 2 months, I don't think about smoking, I don't want to smoke, I don't have dreams about smoking. Many people say that the craving sticks with them even years down the road but I'm here to tell you it doesn't have to be that way.

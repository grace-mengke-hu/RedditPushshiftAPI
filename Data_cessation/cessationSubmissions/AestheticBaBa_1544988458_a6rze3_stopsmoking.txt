Relapse

Guys i relapsed after 2 weeks.
I used to smoke weed and cigarettes until last 2 weeks when i stopped but also i stopped smoking because i gave my money to my girlfriend and told her not to give me money or else ill go buy shit to smoke.
But i got my paycheck 2 days ago and had cash and went on to buy weed and ciggs.
Got high and wss feeling so shitty because i  was clean for 2 weeks.
Please guys is there any way that i can not buy shit. The money not keeping thing doesnt work in the long run.
Please any suggestions are appreciated.
Thank you.
Live smokefree.

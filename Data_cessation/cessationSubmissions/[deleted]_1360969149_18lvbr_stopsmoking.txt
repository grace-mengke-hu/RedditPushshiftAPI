Relapse

This is a post concerning Snus, a smoke-less tobacco product. I'm sorry I'm posting this in a subreddit focused on smoking, but we're both ultimately addicted to the same substance. 


Some background: I was snus-free for almost 3 month, and nicotine free for almost 2 month (I did a month of nicotine gum). Then all of a sudden I got a huge craving, as strong as my first day of quitting -- only this time I wasn't prepared. I became weak, I took a snus. It wasn't as good as I had mentally hyped it to be. I promised myself that this would be the last snus. That was two days ago. Today I got another craving, this time it was easier to give in given the last failure -- and I took another snus. This time it felt better, and I'm scared I won't be able to not take another one, then another one and eventually going into old habits.



I guess just talking about it could help, that's why I'm writing here. I'm not sure what I want to gain, advice perhaps?



Thanks for reading though, whoever could be arsed. :)

Edit: This is also my first try on quitting, and I want it to be my last try!

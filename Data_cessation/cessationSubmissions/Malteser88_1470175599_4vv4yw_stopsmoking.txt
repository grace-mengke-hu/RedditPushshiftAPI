Quit smoking, but is it healthy for me?

35 days on...

How do I stop binge eating during the day.
How do I stop binge drinking during the night.
How do I cope with the panic attacks and hypersensitivity. 
How do I cope with zoning out and not being able to think.
How do I cope with IBS and shitting 6-8 times a day.

My psychological need for cigarettes has evaporated, but my quality of life has taken a nose dive. A lot of problems i had when I was young have come back to haunt me.  I decided that after work I'd buy some rolling tobacco and roll myself a dirty one to take the edge off, but instead I went home and drunk 6 pints of beer on a weekday.

I quit smoking to improve my health and to better utilize my time, but I feel horrible and I just feel like I've replaced it with worse habits.

Edit:

coping mechanisms I'm trying and sticking with.

food: chewing gum and polo

drinking: non-alcoholic beer

mentally: long walks

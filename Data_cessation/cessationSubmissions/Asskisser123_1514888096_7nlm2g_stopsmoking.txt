Today I quit!

I made it my 2018 resolution to quit, although I did smoke at the new years eve party. I'm 17 and have been smoking since I was 14, my left lung keeps hurting and I constantly have short breath, I can't take this shit anymore its just not worth it I'm just 17, almost 18. Today I quit for good forever.

Quit smoking before starting new job so i wouldn't stink up the office and take too many breaks; turns out my manager is a smoker..

And my desk is next to his. It's great to have my sense of smell back.

Other than that, we're on the fourth floor. And there's a reason to quit I hadn't actually considered: stairs.

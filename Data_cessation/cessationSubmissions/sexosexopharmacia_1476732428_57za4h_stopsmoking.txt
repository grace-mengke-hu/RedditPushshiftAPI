Quit zits vent

Day 35, stage 2 of NRT and the struggle is real! 

Few cystic spots and a good area of lumps and bumps under the skin around temples, cheeks and eyebrows that don't come to anything but are filled with gunk. 

Have had pretty non-problematic skin for years and a good skincare routine, but now I feel like a teenager again. Hope this is just a phase and doesn't last long. 

Other than that, I feel great and the patch is working well for me this time around, most positive quitting experience I've had after many failed attempts.

Something that has helped me for the last 38 days...

While getting ready for work, I realized something that has helped me quit smoking. When I do something to set the tone for the day, my cravings are easier to fend off.

For me, this is to put lotion on after I shower. I live in a very dry climate and dry skin sucks. I've noticed that days where I say "screw it, I don't feel like taking the effort" are the hard days.

When I set that tone of "I *will* make the extra effort today", it changes everything. I'm more productive at work. I watch what I eat. I exercise. I floss my teeth!

When I skip that one little act, I make the day into a bad, lazy, impulsive day. It's a small thing, and has nothing to do with smoking, but I don't know if I could have gone 38 days without it.

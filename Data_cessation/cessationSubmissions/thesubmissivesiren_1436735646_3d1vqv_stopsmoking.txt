How many times have you reset your badge?

Hi everyone! I don't think I've posted here before, but I was just kinda wondering how many times you guys have "relapsed." I'm feeling weak, and feel the need to find some sort of reassurance that if I do slip, it's not the end of the world.

I'm also welcoming any motivation, as this is my first time trying to quit, and it has been cold turkey while two thirds of my friends continue to smoke around me. Feeling the heat at 25 days.

Whats the best way to help me quit smoking cigarettes?

Ive been smoked for a little bit over a year now. everyone in my family smokes and cancer runs in my family. I really would like to quit but before i was diagnosed with Anxiety, (it was really bad to the point of me thinking i was going mentally insane), smoking cigarettes always calmed me down, and still do when i have an anxiety attack.

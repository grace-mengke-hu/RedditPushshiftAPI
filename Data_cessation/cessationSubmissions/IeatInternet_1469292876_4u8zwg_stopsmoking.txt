Easy way to stop

So I haven't seen the book "Allen Carrs easy way to stop smoking" mentioned here but this book works wonders. He changes your way of thinking about smoking, so for example instead of quitting something you like you're escaping from a disgusting habit that has controlled your life. I'm actually looking forward to escaping my dirty habit starting Sunday night. Anyways if you haven't checked out the book please do, for people who are planning on quitting and those who have already Quit. Don't let the little nicotine monster brainwash you.

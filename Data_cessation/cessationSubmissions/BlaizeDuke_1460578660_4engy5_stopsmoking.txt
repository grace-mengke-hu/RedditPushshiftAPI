What to replace the meditative state of smoking with.

So I've made it 3 months and there is still one thing about quitting that bothers me. I work in Web Development and in the past when I got stuck on a problem I would go outside and smoke a cigarette. I solved many problems during these "meditative cigarettes."

Now that I don't smoke I can't find anything that substitutes for this and just meditating doesn't work for me. 

Anyone have any ideas?

Decided to stop on a whim and its a mindf@#$k

At home, i seem to be fine. I can convince myself that it's easy, not a big deal and remind myself of all the reasons why i want to quit.

Now, im at work for the first time as a quitter and it's tough. I keep wanting to get up and go smoke, my resolve is constantly being tested. It's torture. Not sure how long i can last. 

Is there any way of getting around this kind of struggle? 


It's my first day btw.

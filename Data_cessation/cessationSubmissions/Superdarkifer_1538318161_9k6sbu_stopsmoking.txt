Today it has been a week - I think I'm ready this time!

&amp;#x200B;

[This week hasn't been easy, but it feels different than other times - I'm actually committed to quitting and not just 'seeing how long I can go without'. I even hung out with my mother yesterday \(who smokes like a champ\) and didn't smoke \(definitely had to fight some cravings, though\). We can do this! Let's keep going, guys!](https://i.redd.it/nide34brzdp11.png)

Maybe it’s time to establish a restitution pact. Your thoughts?

For a long time I’ve been thinking maybe it’s time we set up a pact for reformed smokers who have managed to kick their addiction …and here’s why. I don’t think it’s a mystery that for decades smokers have been rubbing people the wrong way. It takes many forms. From something as simple as hanging out having a smoking near the front of a store where non-smokers have had to walk through the cloud of second-hand smoke to go in, to the endless trail of litter smokers leave everywhere including cigarette butts and empty packs.

It just seems to me that smokers build up an awful lot of negative karma by these unpleasant habits, and there should be a way for them to turn that around, and build up a more favorable image among the rest of the unaddicted population.

What I am proposing is a pact that a smoker would make—completely voluntarily—where they would set out in their own way to make restitution for all the unpleasantness they have caused others over their years as a smoker.

Examples I might suggest might include donating a month’s worth of cigarette money to a charity for every two or three years they’ve been a smoker once they’ve come clean; or voluntarily going out once a month to clean up discarded butts from a particularly badly littered area.

It doesn’t have to be much, but it’s the effort that counts. And performing these minor-but-meaningful acts could go a long way towards developing positive karma, and helping to build a more positive image around the ones who are still in the grips of nicotine.

I like to call the idea, “the PACKT”. Love to hear your thoughts around this idea.

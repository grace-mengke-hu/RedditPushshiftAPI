Just smoked my last cigarette

... And my brain is already going 'are you sure there's not one more in the car?' I know I can't give in. 

Not allowing myself o buy anymore. It's rough because I'm used to taking some breaks at work, so when I'm here its easy to think about it. Anyone have any tips on what I can do when I want one?

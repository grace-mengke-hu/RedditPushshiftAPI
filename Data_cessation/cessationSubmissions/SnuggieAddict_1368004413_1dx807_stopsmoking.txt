Finally on Day 2!

Ugh! About time! I'm a nonsmoker for about 40 hours.
Yesterday was hard, but today will be better, because I saw that it's only fear. And once I looked it in the face, and stayed with it for the whole day, nothing bad happened.
I have constant headaches. My muscles hurt. I'm still having constant panic. but hey, I'm damn proud at myself for not succumbing to the urges I had yesterday.

Also, Half of the terrible threes is gone! and I'm still alive! woohoo!!!

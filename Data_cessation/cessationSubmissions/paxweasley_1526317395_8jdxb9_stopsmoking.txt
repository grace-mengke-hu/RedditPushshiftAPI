Found out I need surgery, boy do I want a cigarette, boy oh boy can I not have one

Tore my ACL last week, got confirmed today it's a torn ACL.  I'll need surgery.  It's been almost a month w no cigs but until I hurt myself I was using nicotine gum like I've been doing for all my other quitting attempts.  I read that nicotine in cigs slows healing of ligament tears, and while the studies are unclear about the gum, I can't see why the mechanism would be any different.  So I've quit using that too the day after I hurt myself, and I am in MEGA BITCH mode right now.   I can't start smoking again bc I want to ski next season so I need to be on the 6 month end of the 6-9 month healing window, and can't afford the slowing effects of nicotine.  Also cancer etc.


No real point to this other than to vent.  I'm very frustrated and want to smoke so bad.  I'll get through it but AARGH

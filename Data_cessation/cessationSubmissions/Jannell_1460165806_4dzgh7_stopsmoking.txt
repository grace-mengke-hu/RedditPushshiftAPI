Hard to stop crying without smokes.

I quit last July. It hasn't been super easy, but I don't think about it all the time now. I have gained a lot of weight, but I wasn't thin to begin with. 

One thing that really bugs me is when I start crying (which happens at least once a week - I'm dealing with it) I used to be able to stop cold with a cigarette. It is the time when I want one most. It is the time that it is hardest not to just haul ass down to the gas station and buy some. I won't.  But goddamn. Hope you all are doing well in your efforts.

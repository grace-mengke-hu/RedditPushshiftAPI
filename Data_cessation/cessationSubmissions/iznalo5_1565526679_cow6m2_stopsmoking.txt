40 months smoke free (-3 months of “failure” early on! Keep trying and you will succeed!

Hi All- I quit 3 years and 4 months ago! The first year I had a few starts and stops but kept pushing through. I didn’t really consider those failures because I kept back to my no smoking mantra. In the end, I decided to count the entire time as “smoke free”
because in the long run, I DID SUCCEED and so can you! I no longer think of smoking, could not fathom smoking and am fine around people who are smoking. I smoked for 10+years. You can kick this just take it one day at a time and keep going even if you slip up! I am so grateful that I kept trying! Best to all of you trying to kick this as well!

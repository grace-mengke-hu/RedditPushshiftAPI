anybody have cravings when stressed?

it’s been so long I couldn’t tell you the date that i finally quit

i’ve had a really strong urge to go buy a pack of cigs but i’ve stopped myself each time. 

so much time has passed that i didn’t think i would be getting cravings like this. 

i’m not goin to go buy another pack, i remember how hellish those first 3 days of no nicotine was. 

does anybody else get this?

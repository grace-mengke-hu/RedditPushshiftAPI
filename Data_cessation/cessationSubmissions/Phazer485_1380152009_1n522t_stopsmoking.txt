Tobacco packed water pipe = Puke for 2 hours.

A friend was smoking tobacco out of a water pipe. I took a puff for whatever reason, Impulse decision i guess. Terrible idea that was, Puked for 2 hours! I've never been sick before off of tobacco like that, But i can tell you one thing, Never again will i have Tobacco in any form. I'm done with this. Bright side is haven't touched a cig since i quit 73 days ago.

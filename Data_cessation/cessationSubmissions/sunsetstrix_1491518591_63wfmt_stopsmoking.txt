37 Days Strong.

For anyone who hasn't tried it, I strongly recommend the Smoke Free app. At first I didn't think some stupid app was going to help, but the amount of information it keeps track of throughout this arduous period is amazing. All of it serves as a reminder that it literally gets better every single day. I've tried to quit so many times before. I've tried patches, gum, and a number of other things including self induced hypnosis (thanks Youtube). For some reason or another, this time I haven't had any cravings and my life is taking a turn for the better. I'm growing as a person in ways I didn't think I could, and I've got depression cowering in a corner like the little bitch that it is. It's thanks to this subreddit that I found out about the app, and decided to try it out and I quit right then and there. So to whoever posted about it, thank you dearly.

Almost Gave Up a Month

Hey everyone, this is my first post here, felt like humble bragging a little.

I started a new roofing job and what I've found with roofing is that most people smoke, they did when I used to roof, I remember picking it back up at the time to fit in/get smoke breaks. And well, it was the same story here.

I was part of a 3 man crew and my two seniors both smoke quite heavily, they also smoked weed on the way to the job site which was kind of interesting. To be honest, I felt a little left out and I was tempted to ask them for a smoke, but, they never offered me any. There were a lot of times today where I felt like a cigarette would help with the stress or at least make us bond a little.

But I remembered reading somewhere that smoking weed is cheating, this also tied into smoking. I started a new workout program and I don't want to have terrible lungs/ go back to zero.

That's all I wanted to share, honestly whatever reason you might have to want to smoke, there are a ton more reasons why you shouldn't

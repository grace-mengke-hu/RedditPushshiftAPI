Three hundred and sixty-five days.

Well, here I am. Exactly one year ago I went from half a pack a day to nothing in one day, cold turkey. No e-cigs, no cigars, not even hookah. Zero nicotine intake.

I didn't make quitting into a big occasion or even pick a certain day. One day, I just stopped. I took some deep belly breaths while holding my last cigarette, and when I opened my eyes, it had gone out and I didn't even want to re-light it. The next 3 days were absolute hell, but by 3 weeks I had been around it quite a bit, many occasions with alcohol involved. And once it started to smell bad again, I knew I was in the clear.

My advice to new quitters: quitting is definitely a big deal when it comes to your health, but try not to make it into one. Just stop one day and find ways to remove it from your mind, not just your body and environment.

Hit a week, got preapproved for a mortgage, smoked a cigarette.

Not sure why I can do a week pretty easily, but then something hits and I decide to buy a pack believing I can control it more than I can.

Maybe the answer is in my writing, "believing I'm stronger than I am". Anyways, mostly fine with my choice, but will try again tomorrow.

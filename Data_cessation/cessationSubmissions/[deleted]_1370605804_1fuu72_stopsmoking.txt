Looking for a quit buddy

Hi guys, I'll do my best to make a long story short. I started smoking relatively young, like 14 or so, and have tried to quit many, many, many times in the last few years. I am graduating college in a few weeks and I really want to start this new chapter of life smoke free. I have had a few successful streaks, quitting for a month or more, but I always end up caving in (usually after a few drinks). So I think I'm going to give up drinking, for a while at least, until I get a handle on this. I'm not going to lie, I think this might be the hardest thing I have ever tried to do, and part of me feels like I will always miss cigarettes, but I'm tired of how they control my life/mood/wallet/mind. I just finished Alan Carr's book and it really struck a chord with me and finally feel like I'm ready to stop. That said, I still think that If I had some help it might keep me on track, so if anyone would like an accountability buddy message me. thanks!

Existential dread

I smoke a lot. Probably takes me 4 days to get through 25g. 
I’m a medical professional so I’m constantly embarrassed and secretive about it. I’ve noticed lately that pretty much most of the choices I make around things I’m going to do are based on whether I can smoke or not. 
I spend a serious amount of money of shitty drinks to combat dry throat (notably redbull coz I’ve done it for years and cigs don’t make it taste like shit) 
I drink pretty heavily - beer, but probably much more than I would otherwise just coz I smoke. 
When I want a break from conversation with my partner,time on my own or whatever, I just sit out on the balcony and chain it. 
I travel every week for work so spend a lot of time after work sat in pubs smoking coz there’s nothing else today (I won’t lie, I enjoy that part) 
I don’t entirely know what the point to this post is, I want to quit, I’m basically scared coz I don’t know how and more importantly it’s so ingrained in my processes and what I do I don’t think I’ll know what to do with myself. 
That’s pretty much it. 
Anyone else gone through it? How did you stop? 
I feel like a right bellend writing this but it’s not like I can actually talk to anyone about it.

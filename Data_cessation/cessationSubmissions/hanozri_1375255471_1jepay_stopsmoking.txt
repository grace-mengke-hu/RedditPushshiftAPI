Smoker's Cough

Hi guys, I have officially not smoked for 47 days. I am getting through the smoker's cough portion now where every now and then, I cough up mucus and wheeze. My parents are starting to notice (they don't know I smoked half a pack a day for half a year at college) and if/when they have me checked at the doctors, how bad will my lungs look on an x-ray given i only smoked half a year. They're super conservative and won't understand smoking was just an outlet (a bad one admittedly) for some tough things going on at the time. Will the doctor know for sure i was smoking even though 47 days have past. Also, what can I do to ease the wheezing? Thanks and stay strong!

How to quit, the alternative way [M, 32]

I broke my tibia and fibula 1 month ago on a camping trip. Since there were multiple fractures, I underwent surgery, where they hollowed out bone marrow and hammered a 36 cm (14") titanium rod into my leg. Got prescribed Xarelto, which is an anti-coagulant drug so that all the blood clots wouldn't give me pulmonary embolism, and thus stroke or worse.

Xarelto has crazy side effects on blood pressure and about 200 other things. If I move around my flat for 5 minutes, I get sweaty and shortness of breath.
All of this has been so discouraging towards reaching for that cigarette or a shot.

I was an alcoholic and had smoked regularly for over 15 years.

Been clean (both smoking and drinking) for all this time now and I'm definitely keeping it up after my leg heals and I'm off the meds.

Goes to show there can be some good in accidentally hospitalizing yourself.

Thanks for reading and have a great day!

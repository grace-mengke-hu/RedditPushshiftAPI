Saturday morning cravings

It's been over a month since I smoked a cigarette.

Most of the time I don't have any cravings anymore. Saturday mornings are still hard because my husband is sleeping and I am up by myself. His cigarettes are sitting out on the table. 

I want one. I dont want one. Just one? No. It never stops at one. 

I keep telling myself that I won't enjoy it. As long as it has been since I smoked, it would make me nauseated to smoke one. 

I want it. I don't want it. 

I'm going to leave the house. Maybe going for a drive will get me thinking about something else.

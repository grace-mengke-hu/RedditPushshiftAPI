Just checking in.

Hey everyone. Just checking in, haven't been around for awhile. I quit for the last time the day before my birthday. So roughly 80ish days ago. 

I'm still working on getting back into yoga / working out daily. But I have been eating much better and doing some of the above. 

Have a smoke free day :-) 

Edit: wow! 122 days, i was off by a bit.

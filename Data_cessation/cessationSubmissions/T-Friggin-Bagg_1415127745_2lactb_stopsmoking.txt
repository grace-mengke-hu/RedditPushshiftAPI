Question about friends

Hey all, I'm new to this community but I wanted to ask some you guys a question. It's been 7 days for my wife and I and we're going strong. 

My question is for those who quit smoking and have close friends that still smoke. When you first quit, were your still smoking friends very weird to you??    I didn't tell anyone we were doing it because you don't want to tell everyone and then fail or not do it. So we've kinda sprung it on people. 

4 out of my 5 groomsmen were smokers, our two ushers were smokers, My best friends are all smokers and thus far it's just been weird and awkward when I tell them. Another buddy that doesn't know is coming over tonight, and we'll tell him, and then watch the look of almost disappointment come over his face. 

As you all know, this process is so difficult and just feeling like I don't have the support of my closest friends is just difficult. None of them have really said anything discouraging, except one terrible friend that says stupid shit all the time anyways. But everyone else just acts strange like I'm a different person, which is a problem we all kinda deal with as it is during the quit. 

My question I guess, is does it get any better?  Does the weirdness go away??

Ps: our non-smoking friends are the most wonderful, supportive people I the world right now

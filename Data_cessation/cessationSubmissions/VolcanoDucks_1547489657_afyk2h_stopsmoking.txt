Nicorette for quitting vaping?

Hi everyone. I used to smoke, but 2.5 years ago I had switched to vaping high nicotine juices have have been doing that ever since, until last night. I have wanted to quit for a long time as I am very dependent on it, but I finally threw away all my vaping stuff yesterday. All I can think about is nicotine and I donâ€™t know if I will last going col turkey, so I have been looking into nicotine gum/patches/sprays, and I have a few questions about these methods of quitting. 

Nicorette gum has 2 mg doses for people who smoke 24 or less cigarettes per day
Or
4 mg doses for 25 cigarettes or more per day

I was vaping 25mg/ml juice pretty much all day everyday, does anyone know how this translates to the gum dosages? 

Also is there any extras pros or cons when choosing between gum, patches, or spray? 

Thanks in advance

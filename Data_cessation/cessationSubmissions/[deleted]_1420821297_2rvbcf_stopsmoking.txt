First day (re)quitting after a fairly long relapse. Desperately looking for some motivation.

Hey there, I am a 29 year old male that had originally quit smoking cold turkey for a few months after reading Allen Carr's book from cover to cover in a single night. 

I was smoking 2, and sometimes 3 packs a day during very stressful times. Needless to say, I felt absolutely miserable. Not only did I quit cold turkey, but I was resolute on changing my life dramatically and was in the gym daily. I lost around 60lbs. I was convinced that my battle with nicotine had ended forever, but somewhere along the line I relapsed back into my old habits. I regained some of the weight, and picked the smoking back up after a bad night with alcohol. 

I am sitting here right now not quite as bad as before - but about a pack a day smoker and not necessarily in the best shape. I am terrified of relapsing back into the person I was before and I feel like that this time around I need to end this relationship once and for all. 

If any of you have any motivation or advice you can share that would help, it would be an enormous help to me right now as I am desperately seeking to change my life.

Thanks so much.

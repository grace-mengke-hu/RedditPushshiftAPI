I just smoked my first cigarette in 372 days

I made the decision to go and buy a pack.

I am very poor, an immigrant without the right to work, with a history of sexual abuse, estranged from my family and suffering from PTSD. I work as much as I can, I eat healthy, exercise sometimes.

I was the victim of a crime recently but I haven't gone to the police because of my immigration status.

I am running out of money and I am tired all the time.

My boyfriend of a little over a year left tonight. I asked him to leave after he told me, not for the first time, that if he were me he would kill himself. We had been talking about being in a civil union and he said that he really didn't feel like doing it anymore.

I don't see any future for myself. There is no one who can help me. I have looked, believe me.

I just wanted to smoke. I just wanted that little bit of pleasure and control since it seems I can't have anything else.

I know I have to quit again, but what else is there? 

Honestly, the only thing that bothers me is that if I continue all my clothes and hair and hands will stink.

Does anyone understand?

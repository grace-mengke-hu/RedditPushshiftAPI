I worry about being around smokers.

I've quit now for two weeks and i feel so much better. I smoked for five years and it was a total love/hate relationship i can no longer waste time on. i'm done with the whole damn thing. But, i worry a bit about hanging out with friends. Some i may have to work with and some close pals. How do i hold on to my quit?

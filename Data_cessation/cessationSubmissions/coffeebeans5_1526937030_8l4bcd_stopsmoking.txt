quit vaping

I'm going to quit vaping tomorrow. It's been a long road. Ive smoked on and off for 15 yrs. Quit about 3 years ago and I was in the BEST shape of my life (running 6 miles 3 times a week). Then found myself in a very toxic relationship. That was when I started chain smoking. It was miserable. I hated the smell and would shower twice a day and wash my clothes way more than needed.

So I picked up vaping. A smokers dream who hates the smell of smoke. But I'm finding it hard to give up and chain smoke that as well. I've been single for 6 months yet still hold onto the smoking. I feel like that holds me back from so much.

I live in a rural area so a vape shop is literally 4 hours away (there and back). I also picked up hiking and finding it hard to breath. Just wanted to vent about it, feeling nervous already. Wish me luck

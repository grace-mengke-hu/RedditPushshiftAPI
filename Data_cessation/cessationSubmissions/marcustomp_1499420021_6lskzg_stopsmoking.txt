“The journey starts with a single step—not with thinking about taking a step.” ― Jeff Olson

“Well-being is attained by little and little, and nevertheless is no little thing itself.” - Zeno of Citium (founder of Stoicism). 

Here's a quick reminder form the ancient world. 

Zeno of Citium was the founder of the Stoic school of philosophy in Athens, Greece (around the year 301 B.C. Stoicism has improved my life in so many aspects and this specific quote has been a foundation for much of my well-being. 

The idea is basically that **one must never underestimate the small things in life.**

Those things which are usually identified as being mundane and insignificant are the very variables which usually precede larger and wider changes in life.

**The classic example is walking down stairs instead of choosing to use the elevator or water instead of cola.**

We have a tendency as people to look at other people’s successes, their accomplishments, their good health, their bodies, their wealth and see it as a product of luck or good chance an envy of anomaly. The reality is that “luck” is the intersection of opportunity and hard work. 

**Hard works are the systems and discipline of executing on the mundane and “insignificant” habits in life.**

The small habits and things you do every day define you are as a person, they are essentially what will make or break you. 

It’s great to have big goals, to have big ambitions and that’s great to have. 

BUT it can become an easy to simply make a habit of setting big goals and envisioning what “could” in an effort to proactively avoid what truly will warrant any respectable change in your life.

**What creates real change?** Actually knuckling down and focusing on changing the smallest moments of your day.

Pursue the small things “by little and little” through your temperance (broken into your self-control, modesty, discipline) which is often portrayed in the decisions we make with food.

Food is put in front of us every day and so every moment of the day we have an opportunity to do good or to do bad for the development of our character. 

*Never underestimate the small things, and always remember what Zeno of Citium said.*

Focus on the pause between stimulus and response in your daily life.

Anyone with panic/anxiety disorder and successfully quit?

Hi,
So as the title says I'm looking for input on people with anxiety/panic disorder (not diagnosed - but having a lot of anxiety lately) who successfully quit.

Did it get better? I'm guessing it will get worse before it gets better when quitting - but it could really be helpful once you get past the first few months.. (?)

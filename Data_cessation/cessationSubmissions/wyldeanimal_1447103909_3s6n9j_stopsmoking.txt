How do I deal with (or help prevent) my boyfriend's mood swings?

My boyfriend is on day 4, and I love him unconditionally. He is having these awful bouts of anger, and I don't know how to deal with it in a positive way. I've done my best so far to not get angry, but I may lose steam if this persists much longer.

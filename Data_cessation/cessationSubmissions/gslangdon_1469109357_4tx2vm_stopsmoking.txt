Giving it a shot... hopefully for good

I've been smoking on and off for about 7 or 8 years now, and I have been trying to quit for as long as I can remember. The longest I lasted was three months.

Recently I went through a pretty rough break up and consequently am trying to improve various areas of my life, including exercising, drinking, smoking and just being an all around better person. My ex always wanted me to quit, but it felt like blackmail more than encouragement (like, I'll leave you if you don't quit) which just made me anxious and want to smoke more.

Anyways, I'm trying now again on my own steam, using my own inner desire to get better as motivation. From what I've read here, this community can be a big help. So here goes nothing! Hopefully I'll see my badge ticking up.

Chest pains

It’s two weeks in and my chest pains are starting to scare me!! It feels like it could be heart burn but sometimes they get so painful that I start freaking out about it being something more serious! Has anyone else experienced this after they quit smoking?? I’ve never had heartburn except during my pregnancies.

Day 5 - I stayed home all day

I got scared to go work outside. I would have to drive for 2 to 2 1/2 hours today. I don't know if I could do that without a cigarette. So I am avoiding it until I get past a week before submitting myself to any unnecessary temptations.

I have watched a lot of YouTube videos, researched Japan culture (I kind of want to move there). Hasn't been bad, the day went fairly fast. But in the end, I think it was kind of a wasted day. Hopefully this is the last day I do this, since being a shut-in isn't being free from smoking.

So I might have fucked up

So today I was walking home and I saw a roach on the ground (kinda like the filter of a joint) So I picked it up and pocketed it. I got home and put it into a pipe and the first hoot tasted a lot like tobacco. So did I just screw over like 50 days of progress, and how is stopping smoking if all you had was probably not even half a hoot

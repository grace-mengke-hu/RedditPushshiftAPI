2 days... fought a real craving too..

It's only been two days but I really was craving a cigarette about an hour ago. I'm watching a movie and something in the movie made me want to smoke. I think it was the situation the people were in.

And the person I live with still smokes so it would have been really easy to have one.

But, as we all know, it never stops with one cigarette.

I think the trick is to not think about a cigarette too long. 

Hope you're all doing great!

How long did you cough up grayish mucus?

I quit around 3-4 months ago and I still seem to be coughing up a sort of grayish looking mucus stuff. There's no real definitive answer to this on the internet (that I've found anyway) and I'd rather not go to the doctor unless I need to.

Oh and FWIW I never noticed this prior to quitting.

If it's relevant I smoked for around 10 years. Probably just over a pack a day for the last 5 years or so of it.

I have also had a couple of relapses on some weekends where I smoked around 2-3 cigarettes. That has only happened on a handful of occasions though.

Thanks

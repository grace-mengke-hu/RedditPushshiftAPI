Craving barely holding on

Okay first I DON'T WANT TO HEAR I'M NOT IN THE RIGHT MINDSET!  What do you want me to be this cheery happy go lucky little quit smoking fairy that omg anything that I go through even bad WOOOOOOOHOOOOOOO I'M HAPPPPPPPPPPPYYYYYYYYY if that's the case FUCK OFF!

I AM NOT HAPPY, I AM STRESSED OUT TO THE MAX! MY BOSS IS BEING A FUCKING BASTARD! MOM IS GETTING WORSE ON DEMENTIA TO THE POINT WHERE IT'S HARD FOR HER TO EVEN DECIDE ON WHAT CLOTHES TO WEAR! AND ALSO FORGETTING WHAT SHE DID IN THE MORNING AND OBSESSING ABOUT FOOD! I CAN'T EVEN TRUST HER WHEN SHE SAYS SHE TOOK HER MEDS, TO BELIEVE THAT!  I am exhausted completely worn out, worried about our fiances as well as hers, I just got an electric bill FOR 332 BUCKS FOR CRYING OUT LOUD!

My poor husband, as supportive as he is, is telling me that pretty soon he'll take the reigns and practically order me to put mom in a home because he sees the horrible toll it's taking.  

I'm behind on my car tags, thanks to mom's obsession with food I've had to lock up my own cabinets andddddddddddddd

I just don't know what to do, I don't want to smoke I really don't but it's overwhelming to say the least.  I know smoking won't change it and to the people who also say get out of the situation ROFL ROFL ROFL BS! ANOTHER LIE KNOCKED OUT!  As a 24/7 caregiver you can't just get out of the situation.  YOU LIVE in the situation! Do you know how much even in home caregiving takes? Well we figured up around 200-400 dollars a week.........depending how many hours they stay per day.  I can't afford that, who could?  Nursing homes.......that's thousands per month after the first 100 days medicare no longer fits the bill. You are completely responsible.

I keep saying I can do this I can do this, just like with my quit I can do this I can do this I can do this.  I just feel beat down, wore out, even sleep ain't helping anymore.  Emotionally I am numb, I can't even feel emotions anymore except anger and frustration and annoyance.

I'm sorry I ain't the happy go lucky little right mindset quitter.....would ANYONE GO THROUGH THIS ANYBODY AND BE HAPPY ANYMORE!!!!!!! IF YOU DO I CALL YOU A LIAR!

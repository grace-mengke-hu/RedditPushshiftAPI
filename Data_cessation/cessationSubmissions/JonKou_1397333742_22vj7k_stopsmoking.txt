9 years of smoking vs 53 days of cessation.

The struggle is real! Fight the corporate behemoths, and keep your chin held high. It's all about learning how to live without it. It's all a learning process. 

I'll tell you this: healthy habits feel a lot better than a smoke. They make you smile when you ponder on them, they make you feel proud of yourself, and they benefit you. 

So, sometime down the road, take a look at yourself. You'll probably dig the man/woman you've worked hard to become.

All because you're strong. Damn strong.

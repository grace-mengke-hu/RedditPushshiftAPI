Does calling it a 'craving' increase the desire to smoke?

Craving seems to be the most commonly used word to describe any degree of urge to smoke, but I think that using alternate terms has helped me.

In the first week or so, when there were still physical withdrawal symptoms, I called them "withdrawal pangs". After that I had 'urges' or 'smoking cue triggers' or 'thoughts about a good smoke'.

Sometimes, the sudden urge to smoke is just a feeling that I associate with smoking. I just identify the feeling i.e. "I'm feel frustrated. I used to smoke when I felt frustrated."

Has anyone else noticed that your choice of words affects your experience? What sort of terms have you used?

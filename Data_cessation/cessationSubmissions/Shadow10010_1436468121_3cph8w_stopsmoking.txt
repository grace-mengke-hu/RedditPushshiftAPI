Today I finally quit 😊

I have been reading and just plain lurking here for awhile, well I finally decided to quit. I don't have that one cig just in case.. I didn't have a "goodbye cig" and I'm not going to wait "for a better time". I'm finally done. 

I realized the other day the reason I'm always mad is because I'm not who I want to be, and the first step to be that person is to become healthy again. 

I just wanted to say thank you to all of you because reading here everyday is one of those things that helped me realize that I don't want to be a smoker anymore and how dam important it is to me 😊 so yeah, thank you.

Edit: I made it through my first day!!! Thank you all for the support. Of course I will come back tomorrow for a new post letting you all know that I am still kicking ass!! 👍

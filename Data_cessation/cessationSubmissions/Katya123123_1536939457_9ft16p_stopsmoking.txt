Day 24.5

24 and a half days not smoking... but it feels like decades have past. 

Seriously, has anyone else felt that time has slowed specifically to make this more difficult? How is it only day 24.5 (and yes, I need that half day, I’ve earned it)? Is this purgatory? 

Yesterday someone posted a comment that said ‘I’ve lost my fucking mind’, who was it, and where are you brother? I’m with you!

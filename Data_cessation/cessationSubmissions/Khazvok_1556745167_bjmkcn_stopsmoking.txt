Put on the (21 mg) Patch today

I'm a 35 year old man, and have smoked since senior year of high school. For the past 7-8 years, I've been hovering around the 2 packs a day mark (typically have 3-4 left in the second pack at bedtime). Just finally got tired of this damn addiction; tired of always being outside, tired of throwing money down the toilet, tired of my daughters being sad that I smoke. 


Former patch users, anything I should be aware of that isn't disclosed in the booklet that came in the box?

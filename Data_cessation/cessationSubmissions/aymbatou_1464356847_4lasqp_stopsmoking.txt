Almost 40 days now and I have a question regarding fatigue.

Hi everyone, 

As I said, almost 40 days without smoking and everything has gotten better in my life. I feel more enthusiastic about everything. I now do sports, swimming, and I decided to eat less/better than before.

But, I feel an immense fatigue since last week. It's quite hard to get out of bed, and my fatigue is so important that it sometimes gives me headaches. I'm thinking that my body is not *so* ready for all of this (sports, eating less, no smoking)... But I don't really know. Is this normal, after more than one month? Do you have any advices? Thanks everyone.

One year, hooray!

It's becoming safe to say that I have successfully quit smoking. It only rarely crosses my mind and then the urge passes quickly. I am very happy of my success after several failures during many years of addiction. What made this time different is that I genuinely wanted to quit, I was inspired and felt strong enough to pull through, no doubts or second thoughts. I could understand the benefits of smoke free life. This is what Allen Carr also emphasized in his book.

Read whichever motivational book or website looks the best, lock yourself into your apartment for awhile if needed, don't mind the little extra weight you gain at first (rid yourself of it later). You'll be thanking yourself for having made the effort to improve your life, you will have extra self respect for proving yourself your own willpower, you will be healthier, you will have more money, etc. The list of positives is long.

Looking forward to hit that sweet 730 mark.

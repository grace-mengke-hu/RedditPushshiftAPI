Just reset my badge...

...and I'm a lot more hopeful than usual this time. Made it 30 hours yesterday and broke down, but I jumped right back on the wagon and am feeling pretty good (or as good as possible, considering).

I'm not using any NRT this time--just gnawing on toothpicks to fill the oral fixation. So far I'm pretty happy with this choice. When I tried the e-cig method in the past, I think my nicotine intake only increased. I feel like that'd probably be the case no matter which alternative I tried.

So anyways, figured I'd stop by and say hi again. Hopefully this time I'm here to stay.

An en passant message from a non-smoker ...

Here's a little timeline from the perspective of a loved one of a smoker...  

My paternal grandfather died suddenly from complications directly related to smoking.  I was little then and never really had a chance to grieve.  As a result I am still processing this today.   

Not long after my maternal grandfather passed away, again from smoking-related complications, even though he had quit decades prior.  Likewise, I am still actively missing him to this day.  

My father is a smoker.  He has tried to quit multiple times but currently smokes, just as he had at the time of these aforementioned deaths.  My whole family has tried everything we know to encourage him to stop, but the addiction is simply too powerful.  All of us have asthma.    

During this time I have grown up, gone to college, gone to medical school (at the urging of my father) and am now an emergency medicine doctor.  My father is one of the most honest, reasonable and intelligent people I know - and given our family history and all the knowledge I have gained about smoking, its complications and methods of quitting - the **ONLY** real goal I set out to accomplish by slogging my way through medical school and residency remains out of my reach.  I try not to think about my father's life in terms of a countdown, but it's hard not to.    

I didn't know this subreddit existed until a few minutes ago and truthfully I almost skipped over it.  But what this community has here is very, very important.  I am proud of all of you who are thinking of quitting, in the middle of quitting or have been cig-free for many years.  Please know that there are people in your lives who love you dearly and will absolutely reap the benefits (namely enjoying your continued presence in their lives) of your efforts just as much as you will.   

Some of the most important figures in my life could have been with me as I graduated medical school had it not been for tobacco.  They would have born witness to all the hard work I've done, the new friends I've made and my beautiful and kind girlfriend.  Sometimes I wonder just how much better my life would be if that were the case.  Those possibilities were spirited away from me much too soon and it hurts me every day.    

I'm not quite sure what I am trying to accomplish here.  To the members of this subreddit - just keep on keeping on.  Your hard work and effort against a very powerful adversary does **NOT** escape notice.  What you are doing here is harder than anything I have ever done.  You can do this.  You are worth the effort.  And clearly, you have a good support network here to help you quit.  

Best of luck and best wishes to all of you.  

Be well.

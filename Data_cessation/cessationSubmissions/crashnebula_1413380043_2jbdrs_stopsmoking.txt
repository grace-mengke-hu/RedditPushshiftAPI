Resetting my badge, but moving forward.

I ended up having a couple of drags of a friends cigarette yesterday, but at least I didn't smoke a full pack as I was used to. Not feeling like "well, since I just put a cigarrett in my mouth I can smoke a whole pack now!" is really great. I'm moving forward! Good luck to all of you!

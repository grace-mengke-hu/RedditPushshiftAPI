Quiting put me in hospital ( from withdrawals)

As title yesterday I needed up in hospital for about 8 hours unable to eat drink or move because of the pain in my head, After I was re hydrated and finally able to keep food down they sent me home with the explanation that I had gotten a mild migraine and the withdrawals had taken it to the next level. But after knowing all this I still didn't smoke now I'm on day 4 and going strong ish

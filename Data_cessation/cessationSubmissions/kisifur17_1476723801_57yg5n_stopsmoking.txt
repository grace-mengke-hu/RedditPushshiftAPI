29 days and counting...

29 days ago I decided to stop smoking after 17 years of almost a packet a day and multiple failures at finally quitting. I am still nervous I would fuck it up again and I remain vigilant not to do so but I can tell you that I have never felt healthier than I am right now I am exercising, waking up earlier, less sweaty palms and armpits, smelling better and many other positive things (such as not drinking as a preventive measure).

It has been hard but it is so worth it! Good luck to everyone who's trying to get rid of that nasty habit :) you can do it!

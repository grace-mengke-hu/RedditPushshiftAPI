Day 20 - piece of cake!

I've reached day 20 and so far this has been pretty easy. I think the main factor is that I absolutely wanted to stop smoking - I'm done with being a bitch to cigarettes. I'm using an app just to track the days, but it's also showing me money saved and how many cigs I haven't smoked ... informative I guess, but not the main reason I installed the app. If you're interested in these stats, there are many apps to choose from, check one out.

I've had a few cravings of course, but was able to put a stop to them quick with Nicorette QuickMist. After a spray, breathing kinda feels like smoking so it was pretty easy to kill the craving. Just have to be careful not to get addicted to this :)

Anyway, if you've quit, or thinking about it - you can do it. If I'm able to do this after 35 years of smoking, anybody can! (I know that sounds bullshit and cliche, but it's true).

Good luck ... you can do this!!

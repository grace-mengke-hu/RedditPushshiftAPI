The change starts today

Hello all!

Just wanted to share the beginning of a new journey in life for me.

There's not much to say except I need this, I want this. 

I used to smoke then stopped for a while, got really fit and healthy, and then it all came back.

Now, I'm a little overweight. I'm a dancer so having visible spare tires isn't as pleasing to the eye. I have a major performance in 2 months, and I hope to get back in shape. And the first step would be to get rid of this disgusting habit. 

I guess the main reason for me wanting to do this is to be healthy, look good, and perform better in my passion. 

Granted, shit ain't gonna be easy, but it never is for anybody. But I have to try.

Today is the day I retake control of my body.

9 days and counting.

It's been 9 days since I quit smoking cigarettes.  Took me a while but it's going great so far. Any tips for how to keep it going? I notice that the time when I would smoke...I now feel kinda weird like something is missing. I have been very moody as well. My cravings haven't been too bad though. Any advice is greatly appreciated. :D

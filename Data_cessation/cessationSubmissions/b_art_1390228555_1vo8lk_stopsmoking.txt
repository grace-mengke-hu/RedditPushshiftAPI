Looking for a certain type of Android app. And other advice.

I hate to be picky, but we have a world of choices today and so I'm going to take advantage of that since I can (while I can).  So I wanted to ask if you can help me find an app with certain criteria because there are so many and I've failed on my first few attempts already.  But also a bit about me:

I am a lifetime smoker, and the worst kind.  I started in my early teens.  I have tried to quit in times of high stress, in times of low stress, during travel, during school, work, after surgery, etc, etc.  To worsen matters I am often surrounded by smokers, and I have the freedom to smoke just about any time I want.

I don't know if I'll ever quit, but I would like to at least control myself a bit and I thought an app might help.  I like games, I am a creature of habit, and so maybe the app will divert me.

Can anyone help point me towards a quit smoking app with the following criteria:

* free - I'm ok with ads and happy that the creators get paid, but I have credit problems and don't even want to pay the $0.99 right now to be honest.
* Game like in nature, or just fun looking.  I liked this [Team Geny](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=stopSmokingDemo.team.geny) one with the comic character, but I didn't like how they sucked you in with the free download and then "Download Premium Version to Do ANYTHING".
* Some fun features like statistics, money saved, awards, etc.

I don't mean to be a miser, I could technically wait till my credit clears up a bit and fork out that big whopping $0.99, but I just figured there'd be something free and with ads.  And/or what might you recommend otherwise?

Thanks in advance.

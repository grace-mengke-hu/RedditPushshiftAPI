Vaping a little weed helped me quit smoking cigs and alcohol for a week.

I am 37 and have been smoking for 15 years, mostly on weekends, but for the last two years I have been smoking and drinking a 6 pack every other day. At the end of the day, after a stressful day at my job, sometimes arguing with my wife, and the house just being a huge mess (we have two kids), I could only feel relief by drinking and smoking once everyone was in bed. I would stay up late and drink, smoke cigs, then go to bed, wake up hungover, go to work feeling like shit, rinse repeat. My health has noticeable deteriorated. I feel tired just going up the stairs, I have a lot of gray hair, my skin doesn't look good, and I usually felt depressed.

I have tried to quit many times during the last two years, but always failed. I tried exercise, meditation, sleeping pills, and I even changed jobs and went to work at a less stressful environment but for less money, still I would always lose the battle to my own impulses. I also tried prescription drugs but those didn't work and it seemed just made me more depressed. (No proof of that, it was a sensation, if you doctor prescribed you drugs take them. It just didn't work for me.)

About two weeks ago, I went to the gas station around the corner at night where I usually buy my cigs and beers, and saw an old friend who I haven't seen in a while. He was also buying beer, but he was also buying a battery for his vape pen. I thought it was a nicotine pen, but after a quick conversation he said it was weed oil. I asked how that felt and if he enjoyed it. He said it helped him calm down at the end of a long day and helped him sleep. I asked where I could get one (I live in New York and recreational marijuana is not legal). He gave me his number, a price and said he would come back next weekend with a cartridge for me.

A week passed, I kept drinking and smoking a lot, and finally had the vape pen in my hands. I haven't smoked weed in a long time. It was a late Saturday night, kids were in bed, wife asleep and I had cold beer in my fridge and a brand new pack of cigs. But before I opened my first beer, I wanted to give the vape a try. So I take a few puffs from the vape, and after about a minute I can tell that it's working. I have this calming sensation going through my body but my mind starts racing. After about 10 minutes and a lot of puffing I am high and my anxiety is increasing. My heart is racing fast and I started feeling paranoia. I turn on the TV, Playstation, try reading a book and probably turned on and off the lights about 50 times. I tried lying down, getting up again, nothing was helping calm my mind down. I decide to open a beer to see if I could relax but right then I had a though that hasn't gone away yet. Why am I drinking and smoking so much lately? I have a family, beautiful healthy kids and I'm destroying my health. That thought stayed on my mind for a long time that night and it was the core of my paranoia. I stayed awake for a good 3 hours sitting on my couch with that thought in my head, until I went to bed.  I didn't smoke a cigaret and only drank half a beer.

The next morning I wake up with a very strong feeling of relaxation but extreme guilt about my actions the last few years. Throughout the day I felt very calm, no anxiety. My wife said I was acting different, she said I was very zen. I knew it was the weed from the night before that was giving me this feeling of calm. Still in my mind I was aware of the experience I had the night before and the paranoia. It wasn't a good experience, but it made me feel very scared for my future if I kept drinking and smoking. That feeling of being worried about my health and being there for my family stayed with me for the next few days and I knew this time I had to make a change. Since then I have taken one puff or two from the vape pen every night before bed, I would open a book and fall asleep feeling a relaxing sensation and no paranoia. It's been almost a week now and I haven't smoked a cigaret or drank alcohol. I am feeling much better since and I hope I can keep going.

TL;DR: Smoked and drank a lot for the last two years. Smoked weed one night and felt paranoia, fear for my health. A relaxation sensation the following day. Decided to quit for good and weed has helped me control my impulses and put me to sleep.

Two and a half weeks and I need some encouragement.

I have quit for about two and a half weeks.  Well. I have been using the patches and it has been the most successful I have been with my previous attempts.  I have been having crazy intense dreams that I started smoking again.  Also  I have been craving really badly on certain days. Mainly stressful days with my business or day drinking. Besides my obvious triggers.    Any advice on how to deal. The dreams have been making it worse.  For example. I woke up this morning from a dream about how I had relapsed and how pissed off my friends and family were.   Any help would be appreciated.

It's my birthday, and I bought a pack

No stressful trigger, nothing giant pushed me to do it. I made a deal that I could on this day if I still wanted to, and this morning, I felt like I wanted to. I had 3 puffs. They were disgusting. The taste is awful. Some people like the head rush. I, however, absolutely hate it. I don't like the nicotine buzz. I despise the taste, but I know I'm going to crave more, and as the addiction grabs hold again, I will end up liking the taste.

I want to keep quitting. I want to destroy that pack and carry on before the habits I've broken over the last 19 days reform. The withdrawal was easy. The habits have not been. This post is for support to drop those fuckers once and for all. I need reminders that I actually hate this addiction, and doing anything is better than smoking. 

I miss the habit of smoking, but I hate cigarettes. Perhaps I should grab a 0mg e-cigarette? Smoking weed whenever I have the desire to smoke is unrealistic. Weed is great, but destroys my motivation to do anything. It's all well and good after 8pm, but I feel like I could do well with something else for the rest of my days. 

Just a venting. Help me discard the remaining 24 cigarettes in that pack, and celebrate the rest of my birthday as a non-smoker. 

EDIT: Just an update on the remainder of that pack. Not sure what I'm trying next, but fuck cigarettes. Definitely not the answer. [http://imgur.com/a/lAxUu](http://imgur.com/a/lAxUu)

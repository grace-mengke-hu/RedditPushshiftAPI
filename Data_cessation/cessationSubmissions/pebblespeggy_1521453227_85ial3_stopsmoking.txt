Let’s go AGAIN!!

I gave up smoking on Christmas Day, and lasted until 20th Feb when I stupidly gave in after a bit of minor stress - really thought I had cracked it, felt so much healthier, happier and positive - such a fool to give in .   Anyway after three weeks of full on smoking ( and coughing, and smelling, and feeling like a loser) I’ve quit again- Cold turkey - only been 12 hours but you got to start somewhere.  Any words of support would be much appreciated

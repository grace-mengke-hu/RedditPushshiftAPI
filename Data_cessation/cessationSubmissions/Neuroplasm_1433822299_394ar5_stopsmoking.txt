Stopped smoking 3 weeks ago, but I miss it.

So I'm over the hump, the first first 4 days were brutal but I did it.  10 years of smoking and one day I just said I need to stop, my fitness is terrible, I have a semi permanent cough, it'd become tedious having to rush the end off eating out for a smoke... Yada yada yada... I'm sure you all know what I'm talking about.  


So that's it I still crave it maybe once or twice a day but I have it under control.  Here's the thing, I miss it.  I don't subscribe to Alan Carrs theory that we smoke just to feel normal, in fact I actively disagree.  Smoking totally gave me a buzz, nothing major just a little pick-me-up.  Now that I don't smoke I don't feel that, I feel like I'm operating at 95%, a little less focused, a little less creative, a little less... I don't know, I just feel like I'm missing something.


Don't get me wrong I don't plan to start again, the cons most definitely outweigh the pros, I guess I'm just curious if anyone else feels the same way?

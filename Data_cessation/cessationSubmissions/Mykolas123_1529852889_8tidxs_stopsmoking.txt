It's so damn hard

It's 6 months since my last cigarette. I still get depressed when I think about smoking. 

I honestly really enjoyed it and it simply seemed to enhance everything from socializing and it helped me enjoy life more. Pretty much everyone around me are smokers so I had to isolate myself from people in order to quit. And sadly, it really helped. After some time I was able to see others smoke without feeling very triggered. I became quite proud but now it seems I forgot everything bad there is about smoking. Now I feel very lonely and bored with life and it feels like cigarettes would sooth it.  I can't imagine how hard it is for someone who have been smoking for 20 years to quit.

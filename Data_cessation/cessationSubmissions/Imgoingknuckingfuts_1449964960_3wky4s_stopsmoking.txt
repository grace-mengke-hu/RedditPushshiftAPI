What do i do?

I love smoking... and i dont care about the nicotine. if cigarettes didnt have nicotine i would probably still smoke. its very hard for me to quit and im starting to feel awful as a result. the nicotine habit is easy to kick, but the smoking addiction is costing me a lot. I want to quit for my new fiance and the future we are going to have, but its just really hard when you are surrounded by people that smoke.

What Helps ME

I have read a few of these posts and couldn't see anything about what I do to help myself when I feel like a cig, I go to the gym, I find it calms me down and I don't feel like I need a cig once I'm out if I'm in the house and I feel like one I just do 20 press ups and I find it really helps. Try it hope this helps others, STAY STRONG !!!

Just quit (again) but I have a good feeling this time.

I'm just way more confident this time around, one thing bugging me is that over the past couple years my metabolism isn't what it used to be and I've gained a little bit of weight, nothing huge I'm a 6'2, 23 year old guy weighing 185lbs. 

I'm just worried that I'll seriously gain some weight after a while of being smoke free. I can already see that I'm eating way more because my appetite is usually always suppressed by cigarettes.

Any tips on keeping weight gain under control?

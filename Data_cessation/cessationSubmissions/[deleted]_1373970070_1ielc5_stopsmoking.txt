Back To Day 1.

I had almost 100 days and *boy was I proud of it.* Every time someone lit up around me I was so thankful to be done with that disgusting addiction. And then I decided to smoke some trees, I said it would be alright *as long as I don't start smoking cigarettes again.* Trees + cigarettes = heaven for me. Not sure what it is, but lighting one up after getting ripped, even without an addiction beforehand, seems to be my little perfect "heaven" on earth for 5 minutes. As soon as I smoked some trees, I waited a few hours, told myself I didn't want a smoke, and then got in the car and headed to the gas station and bought a pack of my favorite cigarettes, Turkish Royals.

My lungs feel like complete crap because I've smoked four packs in roughly four days. I'm getting flem already in my throat (the gross dark green shit, which I always get from smoking), and I've had no desire to work out, go jogging, or generally be active. I've also noticed I'm already incredibly moody around people I love, and my sleep is completely off balance. I feel slow, sluggish, congested, and my body is basically telling me, *"What the fuck is this shit?"*

**But,** I still haven't had a drink in over six months, and I'm proud of that. I know if I can make it six months without a sip of alcohol, I can do it with cigarettes too. I'm also completely aware now that I can't smoke trees, at all, because that involves cigarettes. I have one Turkish Royal left, I'm going to go smoke it and go to bed (thank you melatonin) and wake up tomorrow a non-smoker. It's back to Day 1.

This is going to happen.

Hey guys!
I finally decided to give up the death sticks, I've not been happy smoking them for about 7 months but have never had the balls to go through with it, mostly due to fear I guess. I started smoking 3 years ago to keep my anger at bay. Initially, it started with 2-3 a day then 5-6 and it got to the point where I was smoking 20 a day for the past year or so.

I've literally changed my life this year, I've lost 60lbs, I'm eating better and I've gained so many things that I never thought would come to me. I've tried to quit before and it has fell short, it's demoralizing but I'm adamant that this is the LAST time I will be quitting. I've been telling myself for the past 4 months that I'll quit when I get to my goal weight but I've decided to stop being so hesitant and I've jumped straight into the deep end. Officially, as of 1 hour ago- I am a quitter. 

So, /stopsmoking/. You guys are going to be my hub of help. I have a few questions. Firstly, was it smart to throw myself in the deep end? Is there any advice you guys can give me? I'm really nervous about quitting, I don't want to start over-eating and pack on the weight again. I'm going to do everything I can to avoid that.

Thank you, so much guys.
Wish me luck!

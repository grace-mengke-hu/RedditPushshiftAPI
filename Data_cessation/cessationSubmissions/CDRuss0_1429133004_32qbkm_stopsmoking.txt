I want to remember this

Last night I had my first and only cigarette since easter. Today, or more specifically this morning, I awoke to horrible difficulty breathing, my nasal sinus essentially swollen shut and my throat very tight. And I want myself and everyone else to remember this the next time their brain tells them, "one couldn't hurt."

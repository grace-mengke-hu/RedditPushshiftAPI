1000 days

I have been trying to figure out what to share or what I have learned. The most valuable thing I could think to give to new-comers is hope. Hope not to merely quit, but to become free and rejoice in the freedom. 
 

  Freedom in this case comes from a change in perspective. The act of smoking isn't a physical prison; the nicotine is completely out of your body within three days. After that it is purely habituation of thought that keeps you coming back to the cigarettes. To gain freedom you must escape from the mental prison by reshaping your thoughts and attitudes regarding smoking. 
 

For me, the key to escape came as the book recommended on the sidebar: [Allen Carr's Easyway to Quit Smoking](https://smile.amazon.com/Allen-Carrs-Easy-Stop-Smoking/dp/1405923318). I was skeptical but was willing to listen to it with an open enough mind that I have complete confidence that I will never be tempted to smoke another cigarette again. When my coworkers and friends smoke around me, my only thoughts are of incredulity and inward disgust. 
 


Any belief in smoking's ability to calm, to give focus, to improve social situations, or to help unwind at the end of the day appear so clearly false that is painfully embarrassing to have been duped for so many years. It is staggering to examine the mental gymnastics I went through to constantly maintain the cognitive dissonance that smoking had benefits. 

 

To anyone who wants to quit smoking, the best advice I can give is to read Allen Carr's book and take its message to heart. Read it twice if necessary. 


Smoking no longer seems like a crutch or an aid, but has become a confusing and abhorrent behavior which I could not any happier to be free from.


It won't take you to 1000 days to get to this feeling. 

If my remarks seem overly optimistic, it is only my gratitude towards Allan Carr and my happiness at having regained my freedom.

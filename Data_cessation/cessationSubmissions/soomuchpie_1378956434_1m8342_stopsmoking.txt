Today I caved...

Today I was in my usual good mood about being a non smoker, even partaking in some good ol fashioned anti smoking rhetoric with my father who I am trying to get to quit, then suddenly I felt possessed and it just happened... thought that first terrible one would be the one to remind me how awful it actually is but here i am smoking as I type. It seems so easy to smoke... isn't it supposed to be easier not to? At a low point, realize this probably wont get much response, but I will be back, hopefully with more understanding of the easy way...

Passive smoke same as smoking?

Hello all

I'm 17 days smoke free now.

I was out with some smokers this evening and I breathed in some of their smoke, unintentionally, and I'm worried that it sent enough nicotine to my brain to give me physical withdrawal symptoms again. Can your physical addiction be re-started just from breathing in passive smoke? I kept burying my nose and mouth in my glass of water to block out the smoke lol.

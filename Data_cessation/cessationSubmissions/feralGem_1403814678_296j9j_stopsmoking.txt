I plan to quit smoking next week what can i expect ?

Smoker of 10 years (roughly) finally had enough so this time i really do want to quit. I've tried to quit in the past and only lasted a week. I've bought some nicotine gum which i plan to use when needed. I've also got some sugar free lollipops - i figured that would help with the missing of the hand to mouth motion. 

What can i expect my body to go through and when will the worst of it be over ? 

Also is there anything else i can do that might help me keep off cig's ?

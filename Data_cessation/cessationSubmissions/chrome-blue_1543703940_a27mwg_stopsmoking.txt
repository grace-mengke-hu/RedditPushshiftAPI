2 days in after smoking 1 1/2 packs a day for 23 years

I have attempted to quit many times, but never thought I could do it cold turkey til now. Two days in and going strong. The urges are definitely there but I feel mentally strong and healthy.  I have an arsenal of coping skills for when I donâ€™t feel so strong. I know I can do this. We all can!!!!!

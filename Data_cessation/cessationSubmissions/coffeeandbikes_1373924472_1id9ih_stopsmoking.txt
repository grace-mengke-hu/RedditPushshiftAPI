Would love some thoughts on the patch vs. cold-turkey. Also, good ideas after quitting?

I am quitting by using the patch.  My brother and I quit together and he is going cold turkey.  He's giving me shit about still having nicotine in my system.  He thinks it's a bad way to quit.  He's my best friend so I am not really bothered about getting shit from him, more worried that he's right.  

My reason behind the patch is that I believe not only am I addicted to the drug, but I am also addicted mentally to the motions that go along with it.  The past day and a half I have had these strange "ghost feelings" that I need to be doing something.  Things like, the need to go outside to sit on the front step, or reaching down to my cup holder in the car where I normally keep my pack.  Triggers like after a meal or going for a drive or having a cup of coffee are things I need to relearn how to do. I feel like relearning these things without the nicotine withdrawals right away will be better for me and my personality.  What do you guys think?

Also, I just quit smoking yesterday and today I thought I would clean my car.  I initially intended on just getting some junk out of there and organizing little compartments when I decided to just go for it and I ended up practically detailing the entire thing.  It felt really good! 

Smoking in my car was a huge part of my life and it felt great to clear all the residue and ashes out of there. (So gross you wouldn't believe!)  Now I'm off to the store to get an air freshener and something like Febreeze to try my hardest to make it stop smelling like a bowling alley.

What are some other ideas that people may have that are a cool way to clear the habit out of your life?  Would love to hear your thoughts.

TL;DR   Thoughts on using a patch vs. going cold turkey? Also, What are some fun things to do to clear cigarettes out of your life?

Day 1 of the second attempt this year

Earlier this year, in April, i decided to quit smoking. I smoked my last cigarette and put it off with decisiveness. It was an easy and natural process, which unfortunately only lasted 1 month, when i had a few beers and thought one cigarette wouldn't do harm. I was wrong.
For the second time, alcohol was my bane.

Now i have decided yet again to quit, now knowing integrally that alcohol is the most potent trigger i have to face, so i will have to quit drinking too. I don't drink much but i like a few beers now and then.
So yes, this is my first day. I have no nicotine patches or gum, only a few cloves which i will chew on until morning comes and i can go out and buy some carrots and stuff like that.

This time my willpower prevails.

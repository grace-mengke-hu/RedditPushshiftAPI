My way of quitting was a bit unorthodox. I'd like to share, and figure out why it worked?

Hey there! Ex chimney smoker, here...

I started smoking when I was about 15 (25 now), so at least 10 years... Camel Menthol Silvers/Camel Silvers were my poison. I smoked *at least* a pack a day. Marlboro's never tasted good to me, and people I didn't like, smoked them. Don't know if any of this will end up relevant...

Anywho, I remember the date I quit, Dec 27, 2015, because it was my best friends wedding. 

In October 2015, I started smoking the additive-free cigarette, American Spirits (the green menthol pack, for $6!! Pretty expensive, in the state of Wyoming) mostly because I had coupons. 

Here is where this gets exciting for me...
I started noticing different things, after a few days of smoking AS.

* I realized that I didn't get the lethargic feeling after my morning cig, like I did with the Camels. Like, I didn't feel like I needed to have a early morning nap
* My breath still smelled like shit, but not cat shit
* My hands didn't smell like a chemical party
* I didn't crave a cig as often as I did when I had Camels
* Often times, smoked only half, because it took double the time to finish an AS, compared to a Camel
* My lungs didn't feel good, but felt a hell of a lot better
* I grabbed the last cig from the pack, lit up, and ended up putting it out, didn't buy a pack, after that

**Did my switch to an additive-free cigarette, cause my body/mind to quit??**

I wasn't planning on quitting. I enjoyed smoking, and the breaks from everyday life, that came with it. I've tried to quit in the past, but figured Yellowstone might blow, any day now, so might as well keep puffing. Yet, I just up and quit. Didn't want it. Maybe the AS made it easier. 

Could this work for others?

I have smoked a cig about three separate times, since then. Couldn't take more than 2 drags. Just couldn't take it. I chew a 2mg Nicorette, once in a while, because I feel that I still end up nic'in like a chicken, sometimes, when I really stress myself out.

It blows my mind that I have ABSOLUTELY NO CIGARETTE CRAVINGS, ANYMORE!! 

I don't ever want to suggest a pack of smokes, to fix a problem, but is it dumb that I would suggest a switch to American Spirits, for the attempting quitter? 

I don't have very good self control, and my will is normally weak (not so proud of this fact), so this is a *huge* feat for me (or anyone, for that matter). 

I don't want to say I didn't try, but I certainly didn't put much effort into it :/ 

Could I get some feedback from the internet? Am I crazy? Lucky? On to something? Making any sense?

WOO HOO 5 MONTHS

Never thought this would be possible. I had quit and failed so many times, I was resigned to being a pack and a half a day smoker for the rest of my life. Then my son gave me this book. The Easy Way To Stop Smoking by Allan Carr. I thought, what the hell is a silly book going to do for my 40 year habit. Finished the book on Noverber 22, 2012. It was like I turned off a switch. I became a non-smoker, with no withdrawal, no cravings, no anxiety. I was just done. I think the book unbrainwashed me. I was always told, withdrawal is bad, cravings are horrible, anxiety is over the top. It really wasn't. Like the title says, it was easy. I wish everybody would read this book. It was a life saver. "You can quit on the truth or smoke for the rest of your life on a lie" Happy Dance!!!!

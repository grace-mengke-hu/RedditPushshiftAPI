What's the best app and what do you like about it?

Hi Everyone, 

I started work in a government department and it's my job to create digital products to help people quit smoking. I noticed a lot of you really enjoy using the Smoke Free app (from the sheer number of screenshots anyway!)  


I myself quit October 12, 2017 (643 days nicotine free!!! WOOHOO). I used the Alan Carr in Audiobook form and it really changed my mindset.   


But What I really want to know is what apps you are using, and what you find great about them?   


I know the countdown timer seems really popular but is there anything else that you guys have found really useful in your quit journey?

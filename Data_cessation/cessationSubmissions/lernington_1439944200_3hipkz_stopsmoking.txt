After a year long relapse, I have returned. Please hold me, my dear SS.

Back on board.  Let it go out of sheer boredom.  Now I have real things in my life to quit for, and I want to make it right this time.  No bullshit, no aids, just cold turkey and a hard nose.  Fuck this shit, but I'll be damned if I fail.

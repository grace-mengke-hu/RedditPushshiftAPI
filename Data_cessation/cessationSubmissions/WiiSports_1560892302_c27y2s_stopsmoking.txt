18th June, 2019

I’m 17 years old. I started smoking at 16 and obviously it will be much easier for me to quit than others here who have been smoking for over 10 years. But recently I have started to smoke a pack a day, for the last month. Today I coughed up tar and blood, and a decent amount of it. So its time for me to stop ruining my life before I’ve even started it. 18th of June 2019 is the day I quit the biggest mistake I’ve made so fat

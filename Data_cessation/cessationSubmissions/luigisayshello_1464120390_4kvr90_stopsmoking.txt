I stop yesterday, passed today thinking I just like smoking a lot - bought a pack an hour ago

Shit, I have no motivation whatsoever to stop smoking, I was all of today without smoking, actually I had a e-cig with nicotine, but just a couple of puffs on the habits, well, at the end of today (21:00 right now) I started seeing this fuck Charlie Zelenoff videos and I just wanted to beat him, but because I couldn't without spending a couple of thousand to go search for him, I just wanted a smoke, so I go walk my dog and I just bought a pack, smoke 3 during the time I was out (hour and half and the normal that I smoke when I go with my dog outside).   
   
Shit, how do you do it? I really like to smoke. I don't know if I just want to smoke a lot less, or just to stop smoke.

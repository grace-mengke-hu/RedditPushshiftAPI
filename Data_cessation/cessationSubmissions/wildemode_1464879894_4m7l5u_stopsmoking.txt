Numb extremities? Nicotine withdrawal question...

Hi guys! Thanks for always supporting and being a great resource.

I initially quit a couple of weeks ago using nicotine gum. But as of last weekend, I've stopped chewing the gum so am now truly withdrawing from nicotine. I've read up about what to expect, and that has been really helpful (I've experienced insomnia and irritability, for sure). But also something strange that I haven't seen mentioned here (sorry if I missed it). At night, I've been experiencing numbness in my hands and feet, and a bit at the base of my neck (?). It goes away by morning, but I'm wondering if this has anything to do with nicotine withdrawal? It's not really painful, just...feels strange.

Thanks for any insight! And keep on keepin' on, everyone!

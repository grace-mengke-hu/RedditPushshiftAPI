How does nicotine dependence work?

I want to know how nicotine dependence works in the body and how that relates to cravings. Is it based on how much you smoke, or is it based on how often you smoke? When trying to quit, I find myself frustrated knowing so little about it happening physically in my body that I often cave simply from the uncertainty. 

Second question while I'm at it, is it really possible to "wean off" nicotine? Let's say a pack-a-day smoker decreased down 3-4 cigs a day: would their body eventually then come to expect only 3-4 cigs worth of nicotine a day after a while of doing this, or would their body still be expecting a pack a day worth of nicotine intake? I ask because for at least the last two months, I went down from a pack a day to no more than half a pack a day, and usually only 5-6 cigs a day, but it still feels like I crave cigs just as often as before, and the cravings/withdrawal symptoms are just as powerful.

Made a month, some insight into my less black lunged life

Probably one of the most difficult things I've done in my short 19 year old life. To be honest I still think about smoking every day, and I envy those who haven't quit. This scares me because I thought they'd (cigarettes) be buried in the back of my mind by now. I started running to combat the cravings and get in shape. I went from a 12-minute mile to being able to do nearly 3 9-minute miles. Feelsgoodman.jpg

going on 5 days now

to reaffirm my commitment, I have been looking at my Amex account online and seeing the gap from Monday thru today to where I wasn't at the gas station and/or bar (has a beer garden) to which I was a staple at, drinking beers and smoking cigs.

I've been waking up a couple hours early and spending more time with my infant son.

The amount of litter and CO2 I've saved.

This is all I need. I can't go back now, no freakin' way.

hello all! three days down after a year of a pack a day. question on craving timeline...

First of all, you all are fantastic - I've been lurking around this sub for a week or so and have been so happy to see all the support here.

As for me, I'm three days in and I feel good. I don't feel great - I'm tired and at other times fidgety - but I already feel so much better than the rut cigarettes  helped keep me in for over a year. 

I couldn't find it on here yet, but what do/did you consider the biggest milestones of you quitting? Aka which day, week or month did the pressure of quitting seem greatest?

I think I'm really done this time, just looking to keep preparing my mind for what's to come.

Thank you all!

It's summertime, I have been completely nicotine free since January 1 - I really want to have one night of beers and smokes...

I have been completely 100% off nicotine of any kind since January 1st.  I have occasionally used a 0% e cigarette if I decided to have an adult beverage or two but even that has tailed off to almost nothing.

Now I find myself just wanting to have one night like i used to have - sit out on the patio, have some beers and smokes and listen to the ballgame.  I'm having an honest-to-goodness fight with myself about just doing this once to get it out of my system.

Help!  This is the first time I have actually realized what a damned addict I am.

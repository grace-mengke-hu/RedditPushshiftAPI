Rage...yikes.

I've been using the step one patches. Yesterday and today the patch got wet and started to fall off. I have been going through some life bs besides quitting smoking, and been emotional. Well anyhow I felt paranoia, hyperactive, and no other way to put it but Rage. With a capital R. RAGE. I was actually afraid I might hurt someone somehow, well I was afraid it was about to be there. Anyone else? Should I call the psyche emergency or is this normal... Wow it's been a tough time to quit but still at it.

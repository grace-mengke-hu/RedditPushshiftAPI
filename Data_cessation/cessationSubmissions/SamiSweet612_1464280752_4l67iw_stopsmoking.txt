Back for support

Well I made it about 9 months before I succumbed to the old evil habit. I don't know what happened...I had a bad night and smoked half a pack within about an hour. After that it was all downhill from there. I guess I thought I would just be an occasional smoker and that I could smoke during times of stress. Boy was I wrong.

So it's been 2-3 months of running around secretly smoking, hiding it from my family and feeling ashamed of myself. I briefly re-read the Allen Carr book over the last few days and said "screw it" yesterday and smoked my last cigarette.

This subreddit was really helpful through my last quit and I'm here to lean on you guys again. Thank you always for your support and encouragement.

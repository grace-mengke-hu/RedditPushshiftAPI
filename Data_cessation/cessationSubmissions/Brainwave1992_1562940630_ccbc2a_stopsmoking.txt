Day ten of quit!

I at 27 years of age took a PFT that came back with 60%lung function. Coupled with my central obesity it was a scary result. I quit smoking after the test. Its been ten days since and I haven't had a puff! 

Getting bad cravings today and there's a voice in my head that's asking if all this abstinence is worth it, that everybody dies and that I can stop at another time why stop now. Its giving examples of those friends of mine at work who continue smoking. Its asking me to have 'tea' at shops I used to smoke.

But not today. I'm back home and enjoying my ability to breathe and feel fresh in my lungs without the guilt of smoking and the disgusting odor to go with it. I have  a packet of nicotine gums just in case the craving gets too much but I'm not reaching for that either.

Next I need to focus on my obesity and get healthy but this quit is a tough test that I am adamant to pass. Not one puff ever.

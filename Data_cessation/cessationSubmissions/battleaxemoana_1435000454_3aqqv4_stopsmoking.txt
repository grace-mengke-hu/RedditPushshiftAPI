Somebody's got a case of the Mondays.

It's day 4:  I did just fine this morning with my cup of coffee on the drive to work.  
Hindsight: Maybe it was the Vine video that "I Fucking Love Science" had on their facebook feed that shows a healthy lung at full capacity versus a smoker's lung.  
Anywho, I was doing good until about 10 minutes ago.  I'm currently sucking on a cinnamon jolly rancher and rubbing my nicotine patch, but damn this craving is rough!  Its an emotional thing for me: missing the time to myself away from my desk at work, or needing time to clear my head.  Yes, I could go on a short walk...but I just don't feel like that either!  AH!  Thanks for letting me vent.  I'm going to keep on trucking for the greater good.  Carry on!

two weeks!

Finally made it two weeks :). I really held off posting here because of my failures, but I'll be two weeks in two hours! Feels great man, to have few cravings.

This time, I kept Allen Carr's book to heart and didn't buy lozenges after finishing them. It's working, which is all that matters. I think the old area was just bad, most people smoked at bus stops despite being illegal here. That sort of thing. I'm confident I'll beable to make it now, because I'm around second hand smoke very rarely.

On top of that, life is turning around for me! It's too personal to describe online, but things are looking way up after a long many years.

Finally resolving to quit and get my health back to rejoin the Navy

I have been a fairly regular smoker for the last three years. I got up to 2 packs of Marlboro reds a day while in the Navy and carried that on to smoking a pack to two packs a day while a carpenter.  I've luckily scaled back a bit and have quit periodically for a couple weeks at a time.  My girlfriend believes I have quit but I've been sneaking some when I'm out at the bars, a couple at work, etc.

I'm working to get back into the Navy and must get myself back into great shape.  I'm lucky that I have still maintained decent physical shape but I am disappointed that I tire so easily during pick-up soccer and basketball and my run times are pathetic compared to the past.

I just threw away my pack with a couple left and begin working out tonight.  After exploring this subreddit I feel this will be a great aid.

Here's my congratulations to everyone who has made the commitment to quit smoking and a pre-emptive thanks to everyone for their future support in my endeavor.

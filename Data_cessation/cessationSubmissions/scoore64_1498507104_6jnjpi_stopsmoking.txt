Why am I scared to quit smoking??

 I want to quit , and soon. Like in 2 days. But I have this fear of what comes  next. I don't know what to expect. I know I have to quit, that's the easy part. I want to feel good again, healthy , and live a better life smoke free. Has anyone had this feeling of fear, or , crap I really don't know what to call it.  But it sucks. Thx for taking the time to help. I really want to do this!!!

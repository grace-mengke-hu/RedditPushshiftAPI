How long does quitters cold/flu last?

Hey all, so I am 16 days into quitting and I am starting to enjoy it a lot now. I only get about 1 or 2 intense cravings each day, and even those are becoming easily manageable.
  
I think I am experiencing my first quitters cold though. A day or two ago I had a really dry throat (I thought it was a cold coming) but never actually started feeling sick. Now, I feel really congested, and my lung feel backed up with mucus, but I feel great otherwise. I am assuming this is due to quitting. I was just wondering how long it has lasted for others, and when I should start seeing the mucus and what not clear up?

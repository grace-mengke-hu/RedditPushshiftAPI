Update: 90 days guy.

So I'm still smoking. Again I can complain about what is happening in my life, but that's no good. I have slowed down. My motivator was a very long walk with my son uphill. I don't want to cough and be short of breath when I want to take him on a journey. I hope this helps anyone who is in the same boat. I did not buy a pack when I went home today. 

Honestly I saved one for this weak moment. It was a mistake. I don't want to be weak anymore either. 

Best regards /r/stopsmoking ,

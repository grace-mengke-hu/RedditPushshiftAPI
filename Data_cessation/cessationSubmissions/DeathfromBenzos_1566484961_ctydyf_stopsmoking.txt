Day 3

Good morning/evening! Today is day 3 of no smoking! I have been smoking for roughly 8 years. I have began the journey of Sobriety 56 days ago. I wanted to have my not smoking date the same but i really thought the cigarettes were helping. Needless to say; they werenâ€™t!  A big cheers to all of you in the community! You guys are a big support!

Uuugghh!!!!

So, today marks 4 days since I’ve had a cigarette; 4 days, 14 hours and 3 minutes (and counting) to be exact. I’ve been fine mostly. Today though, I was just hit with this overwhelming depression. I took one of my boyfriend’s cigarettes out of the box, put it in my mouth and decided to open the app I have on my phone and it suggested I come here, so here I am.
I’ve quit a few times. Once in 2013 for 4 months, once in 2014 for 4 months and once in 2015 for a little over a month. 
This time, I pretty much HAD to quit. Got my Wisdom teeth out on Friday and I had already decided that since I would have to go without smoking for at least 3 days, I should just quit altogether . 
The last three times I’ve quit, it wasn’t this hard, which just goes to show that my “quits” are more successful when I quit on a whim than when I plan it.
Anyway, today has been the hardest so far. I’m glad to say, I did not light the cigarette. I put it back but I’m still thinking about it. I thought the first 3 days were the “hardest”?!

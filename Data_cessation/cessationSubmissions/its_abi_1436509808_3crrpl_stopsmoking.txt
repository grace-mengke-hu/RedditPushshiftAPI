Havent smoked for 7 days

I decided to start lifting, running and getting fitter and quitting smoking really helped me to start my fitness journey. I have been smoking since I was 15 and now I am 18. I really want to thank this subreddit because it gives us so much motivation, reading all the posts of people who havent smoked for months and telling how great they feel makes me happy for them, but also encourage me because I realise I can achieve the same thing if I really want to.

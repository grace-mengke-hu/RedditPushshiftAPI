How did you quit?

I would love to hear your stories and techniques on how you managed to leave it all behind you. 
I'm 19 and been smoking 15 cigarettes a day for 2 years, I am trying really hard to stop this addiction before it gets too serious, with little success. Today I bought a deck, and the second I bought it I just felt like a weak-willed addict. It made me very ashamed and I have no idea how I'm supposed to do this. 
Hearing other people's success stories would be very helpful! Please share

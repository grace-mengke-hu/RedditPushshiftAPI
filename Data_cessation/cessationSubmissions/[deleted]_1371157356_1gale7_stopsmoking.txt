My experience with Chantix so far

In case anyone is considering Chantix...

After attempting to quit via cold turkey and nicotine supplements several times(the patch just never seemed appealing), I believe that Chantix is key to helping me stop after 9 years of smoking about a pack a day. I discussed it with my doctor, and began taking the prescription 8 days ago, upping the dose leading up to a maximum dosage today.

As soon as you start taking it, something feels different. You go through your routine, but your cigarettes taste funny and you don't finish some. By the 4th day I had naturally removed a few from my routine. By day 7 I only had 5. Keep in mind that I was conscious about wanting to quit and probably could have easily continued smoking through today if I didn't make the effort.

Anyways, it has been over 24 hours since my last smoke and I can already tell that I am going to make it. This is usually my most difficult time in process (3 months was my longest stint), but I am working and functioning above my normal productivity level.

Normally my day is filled with anxiety, which I now assume was caused by smoking. As soon as I started Chantix the anxiety just went away. It might be just me, but so far this drug has been a miracle worker. 

**TL;DR** I would highly recommend Chantix for those who have failed with other methods.

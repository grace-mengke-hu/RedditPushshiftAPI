Week one, done!

I quit last week, 04/18/2018, with the help of chantix. I've been lucky enough to have any of the bad effects that I've heard from friends. Though it wasn't easy by any means it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be.  On my last cigarette I only took three drags, walked into the house, then realised I smelled like a cheap motel room. Coffee in the morning isn't ruined with out a cigarette, I can sit in my usual seat outside my favorite bar in my town square with out cravings bugging me. Work along with the quitters flu starting up today (noticeably) have been the hardest part so far. Anyone else quitting, you guys got this!

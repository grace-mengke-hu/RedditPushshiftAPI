Time to try yet again. I smoke more out of habit than stress, any advice to kick it for good this time?

 I smoke mainly out of habit now, I don't really feel anything from it anymore, like ever. I just find myself constantly picking up more. I probably go through 2 packs a week or so, 5-6 cigarettes a day and I want to stop, but for some reason I'm having a lot of trouble sticking with it for more than a day. So if any of you had something similar and found a good replacement for the habit that would be great (I've tried gum, tea, all sorts of things) 

Oh, and I've been too lazy to reset my badge until now, so ignore that if it's not down

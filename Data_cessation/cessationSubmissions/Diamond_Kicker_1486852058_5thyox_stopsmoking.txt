Just Checking In

Well, it's been 98 days since I've last smoked. Honestly it's been a rough ride, but I've been fortunate enough to not lose the focus of said ride. 


I started singing again, playing the piano and working out; and every time I use my body for one of these activities I remind myself of how much more under my control it – the body – is without the nicotine/tar/tobacco.


I remember how I my hands don't shake when I'm at the piano anymore.


I remember how I don't cough anymore when I my voice cracks. I didn't know how ridiculously obvious it is to tell when a singer smokes. If you don't smoke you'll cough once or twice maximum, if you do smoke you'll literally struggle not to cough more than five consecutive times and still fail and some people notice that. It's super embarrassing.


I remember how easier it is to breathe even when my body feels like it's about to give in when I'm jogging. My legs may burn but my lungs work perfectly. Oh and I've finally put on some weight!!! :D

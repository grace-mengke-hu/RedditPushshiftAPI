23 days and headaches

Hi all. I used to smoke a vaporizer way too often. The convenience of smoking wherever and whenever made me decide that I was super addicted. I quit cold turkey 23 days ago, the first two days the headaches were out of this world, now I still get the occasional headache but it is bearable I can go about my life with no problems. Has anyone else has a similar experience? I would love to know more to give me and indication of what is going onowhere. Thanks!

I hope I can find the strength you all seem to have.

I'm 20, working on my second year of college.  I started smoking when I was 15 and in the last 2 years I've had 2 separate 2-month periods where I quit cold turkey.  I came here out of curiosity, and maybe a little bit of desperation, but I see people who have been smoking for longer than I've been on this earth giving up this disgusting habit.  [So I talked myself into it again.](http://i.imgur.com/qriCrIu.jpg) I hope I can be as strong as the rest of you.

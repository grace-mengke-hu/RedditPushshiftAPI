I'm done for awhile and hopefully for a long while. Its started to hurt my lungs again and I'm sick of the dependence so wish me luck.

These posts going to be my motivation and reminders that I wrote my name or at least internet name on something saying j was going to do it to not only better myself but those around me. So if you have any advice or any motivational words I'm all ears. Thanks guys. I'll reset my counter now

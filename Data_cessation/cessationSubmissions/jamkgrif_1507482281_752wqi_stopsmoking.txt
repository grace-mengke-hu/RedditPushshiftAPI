2 week in... Overeating solutions?

Hi,

I am two weeks in and I am worried about my eating habits. One of the great things of quitting smoking is that it gives you back almost two hours every day. I find myself filling that time with eating. I haven't gained much weight, but if this continues I could gain 10 pounds in a year. Currently, I am drinking more water to help with both cigarettes and food craving. Next, I am trying to run more because it's easier to say no when you spend 30 minutes in running agony just to eat a burger.   
  
**I wonder if there is more I can do to eliminate the substitution of cigarettes for food. What have you done as you quite to remove the food temptation?**  
  
Thank you, jamkgrif

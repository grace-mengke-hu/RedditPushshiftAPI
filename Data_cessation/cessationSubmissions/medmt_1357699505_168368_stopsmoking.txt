Problems Focusing

So I'm doing great, past the worst part of it, feel like a true non-smoker!

The only problem is, school is picking up again and I can NOT focus.  I can do about 10-20 minutes of studying before I completely zone out or get distracted by basic things.  Has anyone else had this experience? Any advice?

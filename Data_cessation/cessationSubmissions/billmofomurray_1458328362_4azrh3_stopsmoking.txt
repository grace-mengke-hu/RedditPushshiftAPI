In the 24th hour of the 7th day since I quit

After nearly 6 months of cutting back to a pack every other day I finally decided this is it. I decided to try the patch. Based on how much I cut back I skipped to step 2 and it's been working well but today has been the only day of immense craving. 

I'm fighting through it as only 7 days in I can feel the difference.  When do the crazy cravings stop? Someone show me the light!

Can Allen Carr's "Easy way to stop smoking" method potentially be applied to anxiety disorders?

Social anxiety, the most common form of anxiety, is essentially rooted in avoidance; certain social situations trigger very uncomfortable feelings which leads to people avoiding those situations. This makes it worse and the person is caught in a spiral of avoidance.

Now, gradual exposure is the best method for dealing with social anxiety and is the basis of the successful CBT method for overcoming anxiety. 

Could Allen Carr's book potentially help me deal with the uncomfortable thoughts and feelings that come from exposing myself to social situations and living the life I want to lead?

Edit: I haven't read it, I'm going to buy it soon. It sounds promising from what I've read about it.

18 years on, day 2 off..... hanging in there....

While I've tried to fight these things off time and time again, this time feels more like I have truly made the decision to follow through.  Sure as hell isn't easy, but I've been lurking here for about a year and it really has helped.  Never bothered to post, so I figure now is the time.     Going cold turkey this time.  Wish me luck....

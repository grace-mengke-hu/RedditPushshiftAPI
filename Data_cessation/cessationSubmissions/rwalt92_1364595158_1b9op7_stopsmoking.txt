I've had bronchitis all week, meaning I have a 3 day head start. This might be my time.

Did my 3-5 cigarette a day habit for the past few years cause it? Maybe, but doubtful. Is this my future if I continue to smoke? It's inevitable. 

Plus as somebody in college who is studying hard sciences with med school ambitions, showing up to class or lab with any hint of smoke is just embarrassing. I think finally learning the intricate workings of the respiratory system this past week has finally help me be able to put into concrete terms -why- smoking is disgusting. 

Since I'm currently sick, not smoking has been a breeze. I'm just worried that once I feel better again, I'm going to cave. Any tips on how to incentivize myself to stay away from smoking?

Day 30. Anxiety and underwhelmed by search for help.

I've been not smoking and using supplements for 30 days now. My anxiety flares up and I know I can allocate it to circulation changes and just general day to day chemical difference hypersensitivity... but with a pack a day since age 16 to 29.. I can't just rule out the possibility of my insides being a little corrupt... I had an emergency room visit with all intentions of getting a CT scan because I fear brain tumors and cancer constantly... my breathing was stethescoped and found to be completely normal and safe but I can't just call my self unsusceptible to something bad... they wouldn't let me enter a CT scanning situation just based on how I freak out about it...

Does anyone know if there is a way to order yourself a scan when you're just freaking out? Because that's what withdrawl is causing me to do... freak out.

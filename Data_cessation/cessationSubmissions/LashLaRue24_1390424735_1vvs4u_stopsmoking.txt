Powering through the first week

So, Here I am, almost a week through, and I feel great. I have been sleeping less, yet having way more energy and jumping out of bed ready to take the world. Day 2 was the worst for me, I felt bipolar all damn day, but those crazy feelings are starting to lift. I have gotten reasonably drunk 2 of these days as well. Those cravings are the worst, but they make sober cravings a cake walk, like right now I'm like, "who gives a shit about cigarettes? They're for dummy dummies." Anyway, just ranting about my progress. All you people just starting up, seriously, the effects of quitting come fast and are totally worth it. Stay strong friends!

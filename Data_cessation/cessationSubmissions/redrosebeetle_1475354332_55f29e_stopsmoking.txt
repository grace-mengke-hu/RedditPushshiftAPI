Ran a sprint level triathlon today.

I never would have done it if I hadn't quit smoking.  I never would have quit smoking if I didn't have the help and support of this community.  Thank you all.  

Ever since I quit smoking, my physical health has just gotten better and better.  Doing a triathlon would have been impossible if I hadn't quit.  I couldn't even walk to the bottom of my driveway (on a very slight hill) without getting winded.  Keep up the good fight, ya'll.

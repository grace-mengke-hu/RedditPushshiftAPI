I just want to stop in and say thanks

Despite simply being a lurker, you guys have helped me a lot.

I'm going on 5 months quit now and every time I fight the urge to start back up I always come back here and read. Reading about how much trouble a lot of you have had, the benefits you found by quitting, and what you are looking forward to for those of you who haven't managed to kick the habit yet, has kept me on goal. 

I really don't think I would have made it this far without your help, so thank you!

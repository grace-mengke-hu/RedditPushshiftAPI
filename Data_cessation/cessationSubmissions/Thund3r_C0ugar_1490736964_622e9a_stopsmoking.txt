When did it get easier for you?

Tomorrow marks 35 days for me, and everyday still seems as hard as day 1. I've had people tell me only the first couple of days are hard. I've had people tell me that it gets so much easier after 2 weeks. I've had people tell me that really only the first month is rough. Clearly, it's different for everyone, so how long did it take for it to get easier for you?

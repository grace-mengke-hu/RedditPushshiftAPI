Quitting, part 2. Just ran out of my nicotine gum. Should I try to stick it out?

I was just looking through my messenger bag like James Franco in 127 Hours, trying to find my morning nicotine gum. None to be found. Just sharp-cornered, empty blister packs.

I guess I'll see how today goes. I'm going to have to deal with stage two of the quit eventually. It's great to be three weeks away from filling my lungs with tar, but there's still the physical/chemical addiction to deal with.

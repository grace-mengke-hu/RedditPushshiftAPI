Not sure I want to quit?

Sorry if I shouldn’t post here since I’m not devoted to quitting and don’t want to drag anyone down. But has anyone else been on the fence about quitting? I’m at that point where I know it’s bad for me and I cough a bit, but the part of me that’s addicted to it says it’s not that bad, it’s not hurting me yet, etc. What was the turning point for you?

I live in a big city so I walk a lot, which is the perfect excuse to smoke. My close friends don’t approve but they would never really try to stop me, and I have lots of acquaintances who smoke. I’m 22 and have been smoking on-and-off for a couple years and smoking in earnest for a few months.

I started getting cravings about 550 days in, which is about 500 days after my last real craving. I'm 7 months postpartum. Has anyone started to crave all over again after having a baby?

Cigarettes feel fairly far behind me but I'm suddenly getting cravings at random without any triggers being around. I'm a new parent as of 7 months ago but you'd think that would be a protective factor (??)

In general:
Does anyone have coping strategies specific to later on in the game?

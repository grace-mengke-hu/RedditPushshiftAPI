Thanks everyone on this sub.. You guys are the best!

Just wanted to say a big fat THANK YOU to everyone on this sub :). Reading all of your stories has helped me be cigarette free for 42 days and I honestly couldn't have done it without you. It's not just the quitting smoking stories that everyone shares but it's the way were all in this together. "Today me tomorrow you" type of thing. I've gotten so much positive feedback form everyone that it has helped me face an even bigger issue in life and that's quitting drinking. So thanks everyone for making my thanksgiving amazing and I'm looking forward to christmas and nye being just as good!

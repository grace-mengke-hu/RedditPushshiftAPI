Need help and opinions

I unfortunately began smoking around 16 years old and have continued and am now smoking at 22 (male, USA).

When I was younger, I always told myself I wouldn't  be a smoke foreever, that I would be able to stop.

But it never came to it, now im still smoking 7-8 a day and have been for so many years.

I want to know the truth about how much damage I have done

I want to know how I can quit

I want to know what type of changes I can expect to see, and after how long?

Will I gain weight?

Can anyone tell me advice on how I should quit.

Thanks

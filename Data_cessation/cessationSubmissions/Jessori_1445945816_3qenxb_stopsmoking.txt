Trying to quit after 6 years of heavy smoking. Today is my 5th day!

The first 2 or 3 days were rather easy. But yesterday and today the cravings seem more powerful and it's really hard to say no.

But it's been 5 days now since my last cigarette. So i'm still going strong!

I'm mainly doing this because of my SO, my health and all the money I spent on it. Also my mom, brother and dad are currently quitting as well. So that should make it easier.

The hardest part is when I'm at college or at work. I really miss my well deserved 5 minute smoke breaks.

Well that's my story.

Do you guys have any advice for a guy who smoked from the age of 14 to 20 and smoked one pack a day and sometimes more?

Edit: Damn guys, you are all great! I'll keep all your advice in mind and will update regularly. Every week or so.
Thank you very very much for the motivation!

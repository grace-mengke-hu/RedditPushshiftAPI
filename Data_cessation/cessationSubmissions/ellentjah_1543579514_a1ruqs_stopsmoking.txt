Major craving after 16 days without smoking

16 days without sigaret and didn’t have cravings at all. Today all of the sudden I experience major cravings... my stomach aches, I feel like crying, ... How is that possible? It can’t be nicotine cravings after two weeks without, can it? Craving is lasting more than two hours, it’s terrible... I went for a walk, eaten my lunch, but it’s not helping ☹️

I'm very sorry if this is a regular post, but I'm desperate for help and I found this sub.

So I am in a predicament that many find themselves, I have reached the point where I can avoid smoking when I'm sober, but cave as soon as I have a few drinks. Except it's slightly different in my case. My schedule is packed and I don't really go out, so it's not that I end up in a social/drinking scenario and then have a craving. Instead, I have a couple beers, in order to smoke. So its complicated. Yes, I can avoid smoking when I'm sober. In fact it's been over a year since my last sober cigarette. But I will have a craving when I'm sober, and then run to the liquor store, have a couple beers, and then light up. This has of course, also led to me also drinking far more than I would like to. And the last thing I want to do is develop a drinking problem from smoking. I'm so pissed at myself. I'm letting myself and my wife down. It almost makes it harder to resist a craving, because I justify it knowing that as long as I catch a buzz, I can have a couple cigarettes and be fine for a few days. I'm sorry for rambling. I just want to know if anyone can relate, or if anyone has any ideas/suggestions. Or is it just as simple as not going to the liquor store when I have a craving? Any feedback is greatly appreciated, thank you.

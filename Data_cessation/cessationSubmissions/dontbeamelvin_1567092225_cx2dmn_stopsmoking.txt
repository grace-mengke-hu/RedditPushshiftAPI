Effects of dopamine deficiency

 We all know that smoking/vaping/nicotine in general spikes our dopamine. When you quit it has been shown in rodents that it does take a while for dopamine to recover. Some of the withdrawal symptoms are extremely similar to the symptoms for low dopamine. This seems to be an obvious connection but I found it interesting.. I experience a lot of these symptoms.. so it's not just the nicotine leaving your body, it is also the amount of time it takes your body to regulate and use dopamine on its own again?

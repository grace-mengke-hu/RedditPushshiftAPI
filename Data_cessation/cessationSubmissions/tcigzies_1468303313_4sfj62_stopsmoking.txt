couple questions about starting

so i did a couple days last week and the insomnia was insane, physically could not fall asleep. i went out drinking and smoke a whole bunch. ive been thinking about quitting for about 6 months now and want to give it a real go. so i just wanted to know from other people who have done it, what did u do to help curve craving/insomnia/stress etc when you started? should i get nicotine gum and things like that? thanks for any input. i havent smoked today so technically this would be the first time quitting.

Veteran quiters, I've gone cold turkey successfully 6 weeks ago and am suddenly having headaches. Anything similar with you?

I smoked for 12 ish years from age 12-24 a decently steady pace of a pack every 2-3 days.  started practice quitting 4 months ago and went cold a month and a half ago.  I've been completely over withdraw and doing well mentally until this past week I have had increasingly frequent headaches (the kind you get with math problems at the end of a test) each day in the afternoon.  I'm wondering if this is from the quitting or a mix of factors.  



My theory is they are simply my mind relearning how to control stress without the nicotine ques.  since i am really self controlled to not panic unnecessarily now after withdraw my brain is trying to raise the alarms while my mind is clearly got it on lock.  It feels like my brain is fighting itself.  I say this because usually i have an external source of stress to blame this on, but at the moment i have absalutely no reason to feel so stimulated...anyone have any similar experiences?

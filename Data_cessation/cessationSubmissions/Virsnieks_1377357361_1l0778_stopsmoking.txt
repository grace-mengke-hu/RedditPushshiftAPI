Almost 1 month and..... relapse

Good thing I didn't get back to cigs. They were some cigarellas but today I thought I have gone too far with that so reseting badge and I'll start over again.

I'm not really mad because of current progress i've made (breathing is so much better so my performance in sports increased, smell, taste etc.) I'm a bit sad I lost the battle but it doesn't mean I'll lose the war.  I knew This will be hard to kick my 10 years smoking habit. Thanks to this subreddit I can read some motivational and success stories to keep myself going, otherwise i think I would just gave up till next year.

P.S. Reseting badge so tomorow will be day 1.

2 years tobacco free, relapsed at new job

I am so disappointed with myself, and it's only a matter of time before I get my husband hooked in again too. It started when he got an e cig, I made fun of him a while, then got my own. Started a new job and the stress, paired with being around real smokers sucked me back in. I'm now on my third pack and I'm starting to go through them faster. Need advice from anyone! Have you had a similar experience, and what did you do? 



 Thanks in advance.

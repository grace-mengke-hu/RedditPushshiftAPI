Partying makes it hard to quit

It's hard for me to not smoke when I drink and party. I'll go the entire work week without a smoke and then cave and buy a pack on Friday cause I know I'm going to party. The next morning I'm disgusted and I throw away the remainder of the pack. How have you guys dealt with this?

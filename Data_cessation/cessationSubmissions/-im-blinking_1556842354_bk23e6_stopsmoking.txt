28 days smoke free

I still get about 5 or so cravings a day which has become manageable.  Still looking forward to being able to breathe like i did 20 years ago but that will take some time to heal.

Exercise is still rough but im getting better at it.  Good luck to anyone who just quit, you can do this!

Tips on losing weight/preventing weight gain when quitting? Any ideas by how many calories we would need to reduce?

I did a quick search here and it's like the oppposite of what I'm hoping for or that there are more posts that say it's to be expected or not to worry about a 5-10 or more pounds of weight to gain :(

Trying to avoid the worst side effect of weight gain amidst my own weight loss journey which I've been following. But now the journey must continue without cigarettes or any form of nicotine.

I hear this is tough but somewhat possible as long as you are replacing your smoking habits with a glass of water or some quick push ups or something active for those few moments.

I also hear that weight gain is sometimes attributed to replacing our smoking with higher caloric types of foods and maybe at the end of the day, adds more of a surplus to our daily totals.

Has anyone figured how many calories per day one would need to drop to keep wait gain to nil or at least promote weight loss if that's what our goal was? Would something like 100-200 calories less be common or are we talking about another number?

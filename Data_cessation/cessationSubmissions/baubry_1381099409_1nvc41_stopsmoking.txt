Finally quit again. This time I feel like it's for good.

I quit smoking initially, ~~as you might still be able to see~~(ninja~~VIDEO~~ EDIT: change was made as I was writing this post), 806 days ago . I made it about 4 months before I started again, gradually at first and then I said "fuck it" and started again. I unsubscribed from this subreddit, as I didn't want to be reminded of my failure. 

Now, fast forward a few years, and I'm smoking more than ever before, and I legitimately want to be healthy. I quit smoking, with the help of a few friends and nicotine gum for the first week to kick the physical habit of smoking a cigarette. Exactly a week later started going to the gym to train for a 5k. I've always wanted to do one, and promised myself I'd get in shape if I ever quit smoking. 

Over the past 2 weeks, I've run ~27 miles, each time doing a 5k length run/walk. I can see the improvement in my lungs as well as my times. It's strange to think that I'm averaging about 10 minute miles over a 5k when 3 weeks ago today I was smoking 3/4 to a full pack a day. 

Now I'm determined to stay done and run my first 5k, and hopefully some day cross a marathon off my bucket list. 

Just felt like sharing my personal story. Anyone else start running pretty soon after quitting?

After 6 Days, I Smoked a Cigarette

I was cleaning my car earlier, and I found a fairly recent pack with a single cigarette in it. After 10 minutes of battling, I buckled and went for it.

I know it's not a disaster, and I'm not going to buy another pack, but I'm worried I've lost all of my progress. Is it going to take 6 more days to catch up to where I was? :/

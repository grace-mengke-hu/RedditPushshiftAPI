Day 6....

Today is day 6...it has been a roller coaster so far though each day is getting a little easier. I quit cold turkey at 1:00am six days ago. No pre-planning...just decided enough is enough. I have friends who are "social smokers". They are actually able to only smoke on occasion and stop nearly on demand. I keep fighting the urge to believe that I can be like them.  I just can't wait for it to get easier.

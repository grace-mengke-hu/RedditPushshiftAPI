Last cigarette should be significant

Why am I deluding myself into thinking this? When I get down to the last in my pack I go "ok, this is it. Remember everything about it because it's gonna be the end all be all!" Then I go and get drunk and before I know it I'm buying, throwing away an entire pack, and then fishing it out of the garbage. 


I just finished the last one in my pack and it wasn't anything special. Just a quick walk during work and I caught myself doing the inner monologue about how this is it, but it's not that special. Well why does it have to be special? Can't I just realize that having to douse myself in lotion and perfume to mask the scent is pathetic and gross and just be glad I won't have to do it again? 


Posting for some sort of accountability. New guy I'm seeing doesn't smoke at all and I want to be done by the next time I see him. Completely done. Like one of those people who say they are going to do a thing and then follow through and do that thing. 


I can do this. Still riding the nicotine high from the one I just smoked, but when that goes away I WILL stay strong.

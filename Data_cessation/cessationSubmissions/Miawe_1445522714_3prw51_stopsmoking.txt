The one thing I regret

Hello all!

I'm 28 years old. I had been smoking at least a pack a day for over 10 years (over two packs/day for a few of those years).

It's now been 21 days since I decided that I was done and smoked my last cigarette. 3 weeks that have been, to be honest, a little bit easier than I expected. But ever since that final smoke 3 weeks ago, there is one thing I deeply regret...

**WHY HAVEN'T I QUIT EARLIER??**

Yep, that's all. Feeling great. If you're thinking of quitting, my only advice is to stop doubting yourself. You **are** strong enough to do this. Grab a badge! :)

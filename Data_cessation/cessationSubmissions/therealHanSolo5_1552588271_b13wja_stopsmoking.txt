Hi, I've just decided to quit

Hi, I've been smoking since high school (6 years now). I've tryed to quit 3 times now and it would just bounce back at me after a week or two. At the moment, I'm vaping but it feels like substituting one adiction with another, plus I still crave cigarettes even after 2 months. Actually, I think I'm consuming even more nicotine through vape.
I know I'm not a "whole life" smoker, but ait seems I'm too weak to quit.
Today I decided it's enough. I don't want any more of that nicotine crap.

Do you guys and gals have any suggestions, tips or tricks to go through this? I often feel extremely irritated when not consuming nicotine even after just an hour or so. Really, any tips would be great. Thank you in advance.

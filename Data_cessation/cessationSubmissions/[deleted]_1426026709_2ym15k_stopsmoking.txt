I really would like to quit. Help me, Please.

I have been smoking 8 years (27 now.)  I have tried everything I can imagine to quit.  Patches, vapes, lozenges, gum, medication, you name it I've probably tried it...

I sincerely want to quit so much that it keeps me up at night.  I am absolutely terrified when I think about the damage I have done to my body and continue to do each day I fail to quit.  

I have an incredibly fast-paced stressful job that deals with big-money clients and shows little remorse...which makes it even more difficult to quit.  I keep telling myself I'll quit next week, or when things cool down a bit at the office, but they never do.  I know there's the little gem 'There is never a good time to quit', but I have been a sober alcoholic for 15 months now, so I know that all too well...

What can I do to stick with it?  I've tried probably 30 times to quit, sometimes it sticks for three days, sometimes three weeks.  Eventually something happens and I give in and buy a pack...

I could use all the advice and/or criticism I can get, thank you all.

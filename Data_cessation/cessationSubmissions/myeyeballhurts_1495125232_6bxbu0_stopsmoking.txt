1 week today! I was here a few years ago......

I had quit for 4 month like 2 years ago, then life happened (my mom got breast cancer, shes better now) and I picked it up again. My Dr recently put me on wellbutrin and I think that is what has helped. I tried smoking and it just tastes awful. I really havent had cravings, more I had to get used to the habbit smoking (get in the car, light up). My stomach hurts today, I remember that happening before and I read that it happens, but it should go away! Feeling great, breathing better, sleeping better, my skin looks healthier! I think I got it this time! (Now got to work on hubs, but I will say him still smoking has not really bothered me at all, I really just do not want to smoke anymore)

Is there anything wrong with vaping zero nicotine liquid?

I've been vaping zero nicotine liquid and honestly it's been working wonders. It really helps the mental aspect and it made the first 3 days a breeze. I don't see anything wrong with it but wanted to get everyone's opinion before I start recommending that to other people. Is this the same as cold turkey? Or is it something I really need to keep in check? It just feels like I'm cheating I guess because it's making quitting a lot easier.

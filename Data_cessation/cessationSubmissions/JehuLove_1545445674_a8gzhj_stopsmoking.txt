Ready to stop vaping. Wish me luck.

I was never a super heavy smoker- maybe a pack or two a week at the heaviest.  Five years ago, I switched over to vaping, and I feel like I’m at the point where I need to get that monkey off my back, too.  

I’ve sort of set up my plan to quit in such a way that I won’t have much choice.  I’ve just dumped my remaining e-liquid. In about 6 hours, I’ll be boarding a 13-hour flight, and leaving my vape behind.  When I land, I’ll be in Salt Lake City, Utah, spending Christmas with Mormon family members.  Haven’t been to the states in 5 years,  and hoping the novelty, family presence, and holiday festivities will help distract me from the worst of it.  I have 6 pieces of nicotine gum in my bag in case of a freakout.  

I’ll have 2 weeks with zero access to cigarettes or vaping.  I think it’s gonna work.  Will be checking in here during the next couple weeks- your thoughts and support would be hugely appreciated!

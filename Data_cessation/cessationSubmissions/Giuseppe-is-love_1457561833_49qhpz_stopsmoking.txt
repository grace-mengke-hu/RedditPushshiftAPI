Decided it's time to quit, Day 1

Hey guys, I started smoking around the age of 15, 22 now so about 7 years under my belt. A while ago cigarettes really started making me feel terrible when I smoked them, I have a problem with my neck which basically causes me to be in pain all the time, cigarettes make this pain significantly worse, but for some reason I continued to smoke them. I feel like I've finally reached a point where I have to say enough is enough, I can't keep doing this because it is just causing me too much pain.

I have had many problems with drugs in the past (the really bad ones) which I believe is the main reason for most of my health problems, I want to feel healthy again, I feel like I'm on a good path now, but cigarettes are still standing in my way.

I had my last couple puffs of a cigarette (one left over from last night) at 9:00am this morning and I plan to make that my last one. I went out to buy nicotine gum at lunch today, I considered a few options (wellbutrin, chantix, CT, etc.) I decided the drugs were a terrible idea, I've taken wellbutrin plenty of times in the past for depression and honestly I'm done with all that shit, chantix has too many horror stories for me to consider that, and I don't think i can manage CT right now. So i bought a bunch of 2mg gum.

I'm hoping to use this community for daily updates through this journey, I figure if I can quit heroin (CT more times than i'd like to remember) then I can quit these awful cigarettes which do almost nothing good for me anymore. Wish me luck!

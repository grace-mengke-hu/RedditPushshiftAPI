One week down: The mental battleground.

I decided to quit smoking last week and it has been an interesting experience.  I have quit in the past but usually with the thought that I was only taking a break.  Now that I have decided to truly quit I am experiencing what most everyone who has quit has described.

While the physical addiction is definitely a problem I find myself arguing in my head more due to the mental addiction.  It has gotten easier over the last couple of days but I assume that another hard fight will occur in the next week or so as i continue to pit my willpower, logic, and emotions against the biological and psychological addiction.  

I am lucky enough to me the last of my friends that smoke and since they have quit are more than willing to help I find that talking about it (even online) seems to put everything in perspective.   It is my belief that when you try to quit you need a reason.  For some people it is the money, others health, for me I am just tired of being dependent on something as stupid as a cigarette.  I really believe that i will be successful in quitting and that has made it easier to fight off the "what will one hurt" knowing that if I am willing to give in then and endless string of one more will follow.

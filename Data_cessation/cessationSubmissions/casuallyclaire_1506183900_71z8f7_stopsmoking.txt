For those who switched to vaping, do you feel healthier?

Hi everybody! I made it 12 hours smoke free, and decided to have 'just one.' My fears with me quitting is that I will self sabotage when I go to work tonight, I work at a small dive bar where everybody smokes. I think the social aspect of going outside to smoke with my regulars will get to me, so here I sit considering buying a vape. For those who switched to vaping, do you feel better vaping then with cigarettes? My reason for wanting to quit is my health, I am a pack a day smoker for 7 years, with my only break being while pregnant. I want that 'healthy' feeling I had when I stopped smoking for those 9 months, will switching to a vape still give me that? Maybe I am making excuses for myself, but I really do feel it will be near impossible for me to quit nicotine completely with my current job.

Day 1ish. New here. Wanting to quit but it's hard finding the motivation.

Hi guys, I'm here because I'm having a rough time with quitting. I started smoking around 5 years ago. As it often does, it began with a couple of cigarettes here and there before growing into a full fledged habit.

Right now I don't smoke thaaat much but it's still an issue. I go through a pack of 25 every 4-5 days. 

I'd like to stop smoking for a few reasons: it's draining my wallet, it makes me smell bad, and my boyfriend hates it.

But the issue is that other than that... I don't really have the motivation to, I guess? On the surface I know it's bad for me and I should quit, but at the same time I haven't experienced any health issues yet (no coughing or other symptoms) so I keep telling myself that I will quit soon. I also have friends who smoke that I enjoy smoking with. And I know it's stupid to wait for a health issue to quit. But it's stupid to smoke in general.

I've tried quitting a few times over the past year but I've always ended up breaking after a day or two.

My boyfriend got me a vape and it's helped me cut back. I ran out of cigarettes the night before yesterday and went all of yesterday with no cigarettes, just vaping, to see if I could. But i woke up today wanting one more than ever. I don't want to go out and buy them but at the same time I do. And I feel like this will end up like all of the other times I've tried to quit.

Help?

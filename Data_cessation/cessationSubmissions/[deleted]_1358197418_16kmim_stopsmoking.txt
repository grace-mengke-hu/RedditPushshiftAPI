Almost a week and so far it has been surprisingly painless...

I posted last week, [Original to not repeat myself](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/167fn8/to_the_person_that_suggested_allen_carrs_easyway/), and wanted to comment after a week and weekend rife with opportunity, but with zero temptation.

I can honestly say I did not want to have a cigarette at all, in fact in such a short time I really do feel myself viewing the whole situation as sad.  My having smoked for so long, my friends having smoked for so long (most still smoking), it makes me sad that I was in that trap for so long.  

I really watched those that were smoking around me and realized in the 6 hours of watching football, maybe half of those smoking only had a cig in their mouth for about 2 hours, the rest I would put that time at closer to 4 or 5 hours.  Then I did the math and realized on a regular day of watching 2 football games, that I was in the second group, normally smoking about a pack during a 3 hour game (easily if it went down to the wire). 

Anyway, if you are thinking of quitting, or are struggling with staying smoke free, I would say read Carr's book (cost you about a pack of smokes), you have nothing to lose.

Now to figure out this drinking thing, but that is a post for another sub isn't it.

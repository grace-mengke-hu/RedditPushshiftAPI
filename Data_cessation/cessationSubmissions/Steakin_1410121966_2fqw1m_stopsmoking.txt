Having trouble quitting, because of a roommate.

Firstly, I'd like to explain that this is not his fault. I'm responsible for my own quitting as much as he is for his own. That said, it does complicate the situation. (It also doesn't help that he's my best friend. "Hey, you wanna come smoke a cigarette?")

Both of us would like to quit. It's expensive, destructive, and not worth it at all. We work at the same place (a restaurant) and it's often very relaxing to go outside and have a cigarette. This doesn't help.

On my own, I'm very capable of quitting. I don't have a lot of friends who smoke, and I'm pretty social. More often than not, I get shit for smoking. When I was home alone for a few weeks, I smoked just one pack a week. I'm back up to about 5 a week.

How do I go about quitting in this situation? Do I just willpower through it, or do I try to get him to quit with me?

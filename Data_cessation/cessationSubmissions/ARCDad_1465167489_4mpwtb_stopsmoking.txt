How to help dad stop smoking?

My dad has been a smoker for over 40 years now. He's tried maybe once or twice to quit, but now that we're all grown up, and he's got 2 grandkids, my brother sister and I are really looking to push him to quit for good. We want him to be around for his grandkids, and for my mom. We've brought it up to him before together (as his kids) on how we want him to quit, and he seemed sincere, but that was back in September, and he's still going. My sister and I brought it up again separately in the last two months, but it seems like it's the same. We all live away form home, so it can't be on my mom alone anymore. His constant excuse seems to be "it's not a good time", which is a bullshit reason.

What are some tips people have to really push this? I realize we need to be more supportive, and constant, but it's time for him to quit. I want my dad around for my daughter when she graduates college (in 20 years).

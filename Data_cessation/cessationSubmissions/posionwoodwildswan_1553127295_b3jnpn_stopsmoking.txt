I am really craving a rillo or a B&amp;M, and I need a "sponsor" (or anyone) to help talk me down.

Title. I don't even want to type it out. I guess my motivation is waning, but I don't want to give in because I PROMISED myself I wouldn't. And I want to stop breaking promises to myself.

A bunch of whirling thoughts and general on edge-ness that is making me want to smoke:

&gt;!Every day is a checklist with all the same underlying. Losing weight, eating right, being on top of homework, exercising, not smoking, not drinking, not thinking about my ex. All to get back to the point I was in two years ago, when I was seventeen. I'm NINETEEN! Why do I suddenly feel I've already wrecked my body past repair? I realize I dug myself into several of these holes (the fat, the addict, the whiny heartbroken), but the prospect of reaching a point in life where I can even look past more seems like an obscene amount of work. Maybe I'm just lazy. Maybe it's my screwy sleep schedule. I just don't feel like I can do the basic maintenance to be a functioning and successful member of society-!&lt;

okay, this is turning into more r/offmychest. Look, I just need someone to reassure me that the burn of the heat and the rush of the nicotine and the pretty way the end of the cigarillo sort of rubies up and crumbles away isn't going to be worth being stinky, nauseous, having ugly wrinkles and ugly yellow teeth later and breaking out and especially letting myself. I mean, god, I'm basically waxing poetic on a damn Swisher Sweet. I hate how cinematic I've made out cigarettes and rillos to be, and I can't seem to shake it.

Do cravings like this fade? I'm on day two, and I ate more at dinner than I should have and now I'm sleeping early instead of going on my run. I know it's a little every day.

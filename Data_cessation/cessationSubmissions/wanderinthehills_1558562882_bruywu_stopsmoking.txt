I wrote a poem about smoking. It distracted me through a craving

I’ve tried to make it make sense if you read it both top to bottom, and bottom to top. I’m not the creative type but it got me through :) 10 days and counting. 



Tomorrow I’ll give up smoking.
How hard can it really be?
I had five before I had my break 
So today I’ll  just have 3.
I tell myself, 
I smoke too much,
I stink, I cough, I’m skint.
But how I need a cigarette is all that I can think.
“Just don’t smoke”
Sounds so fucking easy 
Until you take a toke.
Like a sick joke
As the monster that you’re trying to starve, writhes around in pain.
To succumb to the desperate urge,
Literally there’s no gain
I will defeat it this time.
Or else
The abuse won’t stop 
Despite how much I want it
I must stop killing myself.
Tomorrow, I’ll give up smoking.

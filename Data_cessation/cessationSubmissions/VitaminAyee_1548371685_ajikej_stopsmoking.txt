depression is really kicking my ass today

22 day smoke free but alas as the tittle suggests. 

I want nothing more than to kill half a pack in one sitting and feel my throat get absolutely demolished because I don't deserve nice things.

Got too dark too quick whoops.

I'm just looking for support to not fall into my own trap. Thank you all.

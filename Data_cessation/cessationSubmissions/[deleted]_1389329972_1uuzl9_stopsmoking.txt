I want to quit!

Hi I'm new to this subreddit I'm desperate to quit. I quit when I was pregnant with my son 4 years ago for a whole 8 months and then like an idiot as soon as he was born I was like oh one won't hurt. Then it went to one a day to two a day ect. I admit that my smoking isn't as bad as it was before I used to smoke a pack a day and now its a pack a week but still its bad for me. I'm 26 I have 9 years of smoking under my belt and all I can think about is how I'm going to die and leave my child motherless but that still isn't enough for me to quit no matter how hard I try. Its all I think about I can quit for a month but then start all over again. I keep making excuses for my self like oh these are american spirits they're natural its ok or its sheesha its not as bad but truth is it is just as bad. I just bought a new pack today telling myself oh I'll quit after this pack is done knowing fully that when this pack is done im just going to repeat the process. I don't know what to do it seems like its harder this time then it ever has been.

Recovering Addict, now I'm trying to quit smoking. Any Advice?

I'll have 9 months clean/sober on friday (fuck yeah) but I've noticed that I smoke waaaaay too much now and it's really effecting my ability to do physical activities with my siblings. I bought on of those E cigs and I hate it. I've heard of people chewing seeds and chewing bubble gum and all this stuff but I haven't heard of anything that's worked for anyone.

In all honesty, I just need a little reassurance that I can do this as well. Any advice would be great.

Thanks guys

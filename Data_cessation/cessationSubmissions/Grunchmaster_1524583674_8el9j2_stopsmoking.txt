Day 2, still feeling motivated

I'm a 17 year old who's been smoking for a couple of years. After a brief bout of intellectualization I've realized how detrimental nicotine addiction has been to me, and how I don't want to carry this addiction throughout my life. I've tried to quit before, but usually by morning of the second day I'm begging for a smoke. I woke up this morning, and the cravings were definitely there, but something was holding me back. I just started my day like normal, except I cut out the part where I indulge in a morning smoke. As long as this motivation lasts, I think I'll be fine. I realize that if I quit now, I probably will bounce back to being almost as healthy as a non smoker a few years down the road.

Thanks for reading, and good luck to everyone!

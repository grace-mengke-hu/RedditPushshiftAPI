Temptation

Yesterday I was at a gas station and I saw a full, unsmoked cigarette sitting on an ashtray. I've been off cigs for 5 months. I was slightly tempted to take it but I didn't. I know for sure back when I was a smoker I would've taken it. It just goes to show you how far I've gotten in my quitting journey.

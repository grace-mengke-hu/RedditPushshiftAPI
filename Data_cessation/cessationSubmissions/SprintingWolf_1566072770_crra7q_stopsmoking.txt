What’s your Chantix experience?

I feel like Chantix is really sold to us as some miracle drug. And in some senses it is! I was able to smoke for a week while on it, and eventually just didn’t enjoy the cigarette anymore. It was amazing. No cravings. No physical symptoms of withdrawal. 

And then it happened. Week 4. I had had vivid dreams since I started the medication. But the nightmares started. At first the dreams were just kinda fucky in general. But they started becoming more real. 
I expected nightmares that were unrealistic. Not deep seated insecurities coming to light and bad childhood memories.

I’d sleep for 12 hours and feel like I haven’t slept a wink. I haven’t had a good nights sleep in a week now. And now I’m starting to feel myself slip back into a depressive state I had just pulled myself out of. All I wanna do, and all that I do, is some basic chores and then lay on the couch on my phone. 

I think I’m going to quit taking it. Because this is getting to be too much.

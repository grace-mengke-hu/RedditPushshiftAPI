My 2 Year Anniversary

Just over 2 years ago, I had a heart attack at a young age.  At the time I had been smoking for over 20 years.  For most of those 20, I smoked around 2-3 packs a day.  

When I was in the hospital, people kept asking me "Do you smoke?"  At that time the answer was yes.   Now if anyone asks, I can say no.  

I quit cold turkey.  I had just bought a carton too.  I flushed it all down the sink:

If you're thinking of quitting, stop now.  Don't wait until you finish the pack.  Break it up and put it in the garbage, flush it down the toilet or get rid of them somehow.  You can do it.

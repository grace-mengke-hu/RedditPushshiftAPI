For Good This Time

I have been a smoker for almost 10 years. Last year, I quit for most of the year, but turned to smoking again when my life got stressful. But the smoking just added to my problems. Less money, worse health. All this on top of the stress that I was going through. And I've realised, now that I've been smoking again for a few months, that I really did feel better when I wasn't smoking. I had more energy, my morale was high, and the constant panic of running out of cigarettes was non-existent.

I am quitting again, and this time I make a promise to myself, and anyone who reads this, that I will not smoke ever again. I don't want to be tired all the time, I don't want to spend money on something that just makes me sick. Lying in bed at night trying to fall asleep, with my chest feeling like a bog, coughing myself to pieces - I won't do that to myself any more.

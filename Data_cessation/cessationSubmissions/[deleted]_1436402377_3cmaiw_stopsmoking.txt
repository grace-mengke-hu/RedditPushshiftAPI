How long will I feel bad?

I've only been smoking tobacco about a year regularly, though the amount of tobacco per day is quite high. I roll joints w/ king skins and make them pretty thick, and would typically have 7-12 of these per day. I'm currently in my first full day without any tobacco(and my third without weed) and I feel horrible. The best way I can describe it is like I just got dumped and am extremely tired, but too sad to sleep.

Can anyone share relatable experience? As much as anything I just wanted to whine, I guess.

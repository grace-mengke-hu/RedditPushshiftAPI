How long until cravings normally go away?

I haven't has a cigarette in almost 4 weeks, and this is the easiest time I've ever had quitting before (so here's to it sticking!). I used nicotine lozenges for the first 2 weeks, but not since. I don't normally have cravings on a day-to-day basis. But every so often I have a day where in the back of my head, I keep thinking of how nice one would be. 

At what point did these cravings stop for you? I know it's different from person-to-person, but just curious of others experiences. I don't have a lot of friends who ever smoked so I don't really have anyone I know to ask for help or advice. Thanks in advance, and keep up the good battle everyone!

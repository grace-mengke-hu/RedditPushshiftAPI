Did anybody else start experiencing severe memory lapses when they quit?

I am coming up on a whole day vape-free and am using nicotene replacement products and straws. Since about 2 hours after I quit, I have been getting bad memory lapses where I literally forget what I'm saying mid-sentence, for example. 

For background, I was vaping nicotene salt pretty much constantly except for my 4 hour work shifts.

Does it ever get better?

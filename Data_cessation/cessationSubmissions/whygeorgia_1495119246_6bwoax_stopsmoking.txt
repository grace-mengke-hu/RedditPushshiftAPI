Quit my job, lots of free time, so I am Quitting all my vices at the same time

I am 27, almost 28. Have been smoking for 10 years. I still remembered my first cigarette - it was a menthol and all i did was to try make a smoke ring. 10 years had passed and I still can't make one. I started smoking more too, this year it reaches half a pack a day and I got excited when i had to go on business trips to China because it means 85 percent off cigarettes.. 

Anyway, I have been quite unhappy with my job of 4 years and since a few months ago I have been working part time and now I am officially leaving. I saved up quite some money so financially I am okay but I thought I want to clean myself up before I move on to the next stage. I have always wanted to become a "better man" but never had the motivation or time to do it. I thought I would just hang out for a while to eat well, exercise more, and kick all my bad habits. 

So here it is , I have quit drinking (never a big drinker anyway) since the NYE, and now almost a week free of cigarettes. I am also cooking more and challenging myself to not go to restaurant for a week. We will see how that front goes. And maybe tone down the porn stuff as well, but maybe some of you guys would tell me that quitting booze, cigs, porn and meat all at the same time would be impossible... I would love to get some encouragement and thoughts from you all :)

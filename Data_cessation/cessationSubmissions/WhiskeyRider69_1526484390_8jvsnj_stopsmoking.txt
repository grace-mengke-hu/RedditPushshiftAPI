I know I'm safe now

If I haven't smoked yet this week, I can't imagine what would make me smoke.

One of my employees has a chronic disease and has been out since last Thursday. I have been having to find coverage for him every day and have no idea when he's going to be back at work.

On Monday I suddenly went into a horrendous allergy attack, with my nose running like a faucet and I couldn't sleep because of it.

To go along with my allergy attack on Monday night, I realized that I was sweating profusely in my bed. When I checked the thermostat in the house it was showing that it was 76 degrees, even though the thermostat was set to 72. Yep, my AC unit died.

Got to work this morning and one of my other employees informs me that his guard unit is deploying him for 3 weeks and his plane leaves on Sunday. I've got to figure out coverage for him.

One of my customers started screaming that they are having issues at their location and they want me to fix it now.

Despite all of this, I haven't felt a need to smoke. I've thought about it in passing, but I have no desire really. Why? Because I now know that smoking won't do anything to fix any of the problems that I'm having. It won't even make me feel better. All it will do is make me addicted again and then I'll have that added to the list above. Nope. I have no need to smoke, and if I don't feel a need to smoke now, I think I'm pretty safe from having a relapse.

Hang in there quitters, we got this!

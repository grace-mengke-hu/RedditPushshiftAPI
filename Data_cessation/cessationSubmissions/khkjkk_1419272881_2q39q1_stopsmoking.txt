Week Two, the journey so far

It's been two weeks since I had my last cigarette. I had my first cigarette when I was 17. After I turned 20, my plan every year was to quit, first on my birthday, then on New Years Eve...  For seven years I told myself I was going to quit, but I never did, not for more than two or three days. Two weeks is the longest I have gone without a cigarette in ten years.


For the first week, the withdrawal and the idea of "my last cigarette" terrified me, stressed me out, and made me a total grouch. How would I hang out with my friends at the bar without relapsing? How could I possibly manage the stress and anxiety of the holidays without my nicotine crutch? As it turns out, my salvation came in the form of a nasty winter cold.


Out at a local bar with my friends last Saturday, after a few beers, I thought to myself: "This is the moment you were worried about. But maybe you can just have one drag, or one cigarette." However, my throat was so sore from spending the past three days coughing that the idea of smoking was abhorrent. 


It gave me time to fight through the craving, and to realize that one drag or one cigarette would lead to another, and another, and another.


I'm still worried about what happens when I'm over this cold, but now I know that I don't *need* a cigarette. It was a very important step. I proved to myself it is possible to have a great night out with my smoker friends without smoking. It is possible to drink without smoking. It is possible to be in a social situation without smoking. It is possible to deal with anxiety without smoking.

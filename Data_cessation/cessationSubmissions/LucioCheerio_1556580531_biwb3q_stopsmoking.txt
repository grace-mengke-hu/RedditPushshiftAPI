Would someone like to be my accountability buddy?

Hello everyone! I apologize if these kinds of posts are annoying or not allowed - please feel free to take it down if so. I would like a texting/messaging accountability buddy! My name is Megan, I've been smoking for about a year now. I first began smoking as a way to avoid depressive thoughts - I don't want to keep ruining my health and my future life - if you would like to quit smoking too and need someone to keep you in check (and vice versa), please let me know.

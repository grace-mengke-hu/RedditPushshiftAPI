Day 1: I am in Control

I AM quitting. 
I AM no longer going to let tobacco control me or compromise my health. 
I DESERVE to be healthy and happy. 
I DESERVE an opportunity to become the person I’ve always wanted to be; someone who puts their health first, not their bad habits and the instant gratification they bring. 
I AM strong enough to overcome the withdrawals and cravings. 
I AM worth the benefit of quitting tobacco.
I AM deserving of better health for myself.
I AM deserving of a long and happy life.
When you struggle with your self esteem and self worth as symptoms of depression, as I do, it can be difficult to see these statements as truth. I’m proud to say I am finally at a point where I can feel and see that I am worth quitting and taking back control of my health. 
I AM NOT the weak and worthless person I once saw myself as and tobacco can’t take advantage of that anymore.

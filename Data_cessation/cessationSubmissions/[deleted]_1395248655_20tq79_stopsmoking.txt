I want to quit smoking so bad, but i have zero willpower and it makes feel like a complete loser

Started smoking when i was 15, i'll turn 20 in two weeks.

I first tried quitting 7 month ago. I read Allen Carr's book and it gave me a huge incentive to quit. I lasted about a week, until i decided to smoke "just one" and then continue quitting. Of course, after that "one" i smoked another one, and another and i started smoking a pack a day as i used to. However, failing to quit on my first try had a profound effect on me. Suddenly, i started feeling like a complete loser because i couldn't quit. I also told everyone i was quitting and because i failed, i was told that i'm weak, and instead of that getting me move motivated to try again and prove my friends and family wrong, it just made me pissed off at them.

So basically, these past seven months have been horrible. I engage in intense self-loathing after every single cigarette. I literally say to myself that 'this is the last one' every time i smoke. I made quitting smoking my ONLY New Years Resolution and i failed... an hour into 2014. Yesterday, i decided to quit for the 34326996541254th time. Today, i woke up and started getting these intense cravings, and i went and bought a pack. I just finished my pack and I know that the cravings will appear very soon, and i don't want to cave in... again. 

I have to quit cold turkey and prove to myself that i'm not weak. Honestly, i really don't care about cancer right now because i'm still young and it seems like it's really far away. But i remember how much better i felt after i quit for the first time (and lasted a week). I especially remember how my sense of smell and taste improved. I will turn 20 in a few weeks, and i really want to end teenhood as a non-smoker. Any advice will help.

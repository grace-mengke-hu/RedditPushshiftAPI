3 months out. Drunken broke down

So I haven't smoked I. About 3 months and im out drinking with a friend who didn't know I quit. I accepted a cig drunk and it made me sick. And sort of reaffirmed that quitting was a good choice. I guess I feel guilty about trying again. My question I guess is that is it ok that I tried it again and found it repulsive? Like yes I broke my quit streak but I also affirmed that smoking is nasty for me. Is this ok? The guilt is kind of dragging me down.....

Today is an exciting day!

So today is an exciting day for me, today, December 19th 2013, is officially 1 year since I have smoked my last cigarette!! I smoked my first cigarette in elementary school, by the time I got to middle school my sister was in high school and had started smoking herself; I used to take them from her until it was time for her to go to college when she gave me her ID and I went and bought them myself. Since 8th grade I had been smoking regularly. Last year at this time I was in the mindset for change; I had started a new job a few months before, I was getting used to living with my parents again after years of being on my own, and most importantly, I broke up with my girlfriend of 10 months. When people say it's easier to make multiple changes at once than one at a time, they're right. I was so focused on other things and moving forward in different aspects of my life that I barely noticed when two weeks went by, and then a month. I will say that I'm sure it was easier for me than others, I have strong will power and the cravings just disappeared one day and never came back so it was all mental. I am very proud of myself today for not only reaching 1 year cigarette free but for following through on a goal that I set for myself when I started smoking... that I would quit once I was out of school. I never thought I would actually do it so soon let alone so easily. I hope, for anyone else struggling with this, that you keep moving forward and looking ahead and if you slip up, start again; it's never too late to try harder.

Holy shit, spent $40 on food and the delivery driver couldn’t get ahold of me to figure out where I’m located... because the number on file was wrong.... so now I’m out $40 and have no food....I wanted to smoke so fucking badly and could have but resisted the urges!!

Like literally was fucking RAGING and pacing around, but now I’m calm and just ordered from another place.it was my fault but I still got pissed as hell...... $40 lesson to update my info... I was just chilling playing games and noticed the order taking awhile and checked my email and found out the driver left and I am not getting a refund... never had an issue with my food being delivered here and didn’t think to update the info because of that.... I’m on day 4 of no smoking sooooo if I was able to handle pissing away $40 on a mistake and not smoking When a cig was literally a few steps away I should be fine with my quit... sheewwwyyyy... took a good 5 or so minutes before cooling off haha.

12 days, 3rd time quitting

Just popping in to say hello. Smoked on and off for a few years, had a few months where I didn't smoke here and there but always came back to it.
I'm 12 days into my third and last time trying to quit because this is it. I don't want to smoke anymore. I don't like what I feel or smell or taste when I smoke.
Best wishes to everyone on here, we're doing really well for just being here.

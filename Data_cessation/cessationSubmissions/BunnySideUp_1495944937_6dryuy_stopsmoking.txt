Currently hoping I didn't screw myself with an e-cigarette

I stopped smoking cigarettes probably about a year ago, after trying out an e-cig that a friend of mine was using, the Juul. Since then I've been surgically attached to the thing. I'm approaching about the equivalent of 2 packs of cigarettes a day, taking a puff or two off of it nearly every five minutes. I just left my house, and before I left I think I lost it. I'm planning on returning and not looking for it. This thing just kicks my ass so god damn hard that I'm afraid it's impossible, that I've passed the point of no return, where it is so married into my life and everything that I do every second of every day that there's simply no way I'm going to be able to kick it. Has anyone here gone through anything similar when quitting? Any advice?

Thanks!

How long till the craving stop for you? How to satisfy the yearning?

I haven't had a cigarette in almost two months now, but the cravings are still horrible!

I've done pretty good so far, but I've put on some weight (always munching on something), and I feel it's like I'm not just fighting the cravings I'm fighting my brain's "reward system" - I have to find something to substitute that thing I want.

Just curious how others handle it...

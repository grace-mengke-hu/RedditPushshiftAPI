I know there are immeasurable health benefits, but has monetary factors helped anyone quit?

I know I should stop for my health, but I'm getting to the point where I think I should quit purely for the financial gain.  I spend my car payment and insurance monthly on cigarettes.  Has this mental approach actively helped anyone else?

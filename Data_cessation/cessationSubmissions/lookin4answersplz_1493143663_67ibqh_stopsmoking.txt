How to quit with another smoker in the house?

I have been smoking for 10 years now. My live in boyfriend smokes as well. I have constantly brought it up that I would like to quit smoking. He says the same but refuses to actually quit. 

We share smokes, I smoke half and give him the other half. He is a drinker and constantly wants to smoke. I don't drink and don't want to smoke. It is 3 times a day at most that I light a smoke for us on my own choosing, we still smoke about 2 packs a day. 

This is how it usually goes: 
Him: light a smoke please
Me: no thanks, I don't want or need one and don't want to be a smoker
Him: I do so just light one please.
Me: You know where they are, you can light one.
Him: I don't want a full one.
Me: put it out a half then smoke the next half later.
Him: That's gross
Me: so is smoking
Him: you're a smoker, just light one

It usually goes on like this for half an hour until I'm so annoyed that I just give in because now I need one because of this or he takes the smoke and puts it in my mouth. I don't have much strong willpower so of course I just keep ending up smoking.

How do I quit smoking with a willing smoker in the house?

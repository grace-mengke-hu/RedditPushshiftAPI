Sup fam.  Everyone hang in there.  I *still* feel like a snake that is halfway done shedding it's skin.  It's not just the smoking, it's my increased taste and smell affect my quality of life, memory.  The way my sinuses and lungs feel.  How sometimes I just lay in bed with my eyes open, restless.  The way I process emotions, the way I manage my sense of frustration, anger, helplessness, is all different now.
  
I'm also single, 31, and pretty damn healthy.  It's worth mentioning that 17.8% of the US population were smokers in 2013 with a downward trend.  Non-smokers  *despise* kissing smokers unless you have some seriously redeeming qualities.  **That means I'm roughly only able to date 17.8% of women.  That number is now 100%.  That means my odds have not only improved, but the pool of candidates has expanded 5 times over.**  I'm also more confident because I know I smell good and chew on mint tea tree toothpicks all day, thus my breath is better than most anyone's.
  
I feel more attractive than even my non-smoking competition now.  I am moving a mountain and I'll keep moving that fucking mountain.  I am a force to be fucking reckoned with.  I am a sexual tyrannosaurus, but with better looking arms.
  
Join me comrades!

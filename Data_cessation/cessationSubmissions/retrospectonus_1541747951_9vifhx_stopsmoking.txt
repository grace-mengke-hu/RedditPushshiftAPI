I failed! To reset my timer or not to reset my timer?

I smoked an entire pack in 2 days. I'm highly disappointed in myself and my progress.
I want to continue stopping right away. My app is giving me an option to reset or not reset my timer.
I don't know what's wise.
Any of you slipped? What worked better for you? Losing all my progress is not very motivating, but I also don't want to fool myself.
Any advice?

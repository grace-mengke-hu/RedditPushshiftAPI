Hey guys, first post here, and 72 hours nicotine free.

I know I still have a long journey ahead of me but I wanted to share my experience with you all. I chewed tobacco for ~ 5-6 years eventually getting to about 3/4 of a can a day.  I haven't had a chew in 1.5 months and I have using e-cigs to thank.  Just wanted to share with you all how amazingly effective these have been. When I first stopped I ordered a Halo G6 e cig online and used 18 mg/ml juice. I smoked 18 mg/ml for only a week and then went to 12 mg/ml for another 1.5-2 weeks and then 6 mg/ml for the last two weeks.  From reading 1 cig = about 18 mg nicotine; and 1 chew = about 4 cigs. I was using about 5 chews a day... 20 cigs...360mg nicotine.  With the e cig I was able to use about 3-4 ml a day at 6mg so 24mg nicotine a day. In just a month I was able to cut down to using only ~ 7% of the nicotine from when I chewed.  This has made my transition to nicotine free incredibly easy (relative to cold turkey, still have my moments of course) and I really encourage and recommend anyone trying to quit to try this system! I paid 40$ to get my e cig kit and juice costs only about 5-7$ for 15 ml  which will last you at least a few days to a week.  Once you hit your 0 mg/ml goal you can still buy your favorite flavors in the nicotine free formula, and I can't begin to explain how helpful it has been to still be able to smoke when urges do arise. I plan to keep a 0mg bottle of juice with me in order to fight the different things that have derailed my quit attempts in the past, and I truly feel confident and good about it.  So please, if you are overwhelmed about quitting and think you can't do it, try out using an e cig, although I have a long way to go, it has worked wonders for me.

Sinus pressure/dizzyness??

Hello all

Tomorrow marks my two weeks smoke free and i'm just over a week nicotine free at this point!

On a few occasions this week i've noticed what I guess I would describe as a bit of pressure between my eyes and dizziness to go alongside it - i'm assuming this is sinus pressure and i'm guessing a result of me quitting. Anyone else dealt with this? And any advice to help it pass? I really don't like being dizzy. I've bought a nasal spray, i'm hoping that may help?

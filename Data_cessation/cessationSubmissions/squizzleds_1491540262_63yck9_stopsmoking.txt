Getting better

Finally today I feel like I've maybe turned a corner. Think I'm on day ten. 
Stomach finally feels a bit better, I slept better, I am positive and looking forward to the weekend. 
Never thought I would get this far and all thanks to a book. It's such a bizarre feeling! 
Keep strong people

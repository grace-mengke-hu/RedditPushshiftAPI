stop smoking today or wait a week? not sure about it

so i stopped smoking pot after 6 years, in the last 2~ years i tried to stop smoking weed with some  small breaks , i had manged in the last month (25 days) to been off weed, it been the longest quit time i had in 6 years.
it been better then i ever been in my life. feel great and more. i had to work hard for it and still doing so.. like walking, eating more, drink more etc.


 i don't want to risk it and relapse again in more drastic way in smoking tobacco and weed, more then before i quit this time. i want to quit but afraid to fail hard.

any idea or tips? today or one week from now??

thank you :)

Quitting today, a few questions for you all..

I find that every time I've attempted quitting in the past my mind will come up with elaborate rationalizations of why I deserve one cigarette. This will happen when I'm bored or frustrated usually, so...
What do you do to keep your mind off it during these situations?

I think I might try to spend more time with my dog, take him for walks more often.

So /r/stopsmoking, what works?

Chewing tobacco

Hello /r/stopsmoking, I don't reddit much so I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this. Please forgive me if it's not but honestly I need your help. I'm a 19 year old dude who started smoking at 17, quit at 18 and used chewing tobacco/dip ever since. 

I'm finally at the point where I'm ready to quit dipping. It's a disgusting habit and a waste of money but I'm finding it extremely difficult nonetheless. It's been about 11 hours since I've had a dip inand I'm going nuts from cravings. I'm also stressed out from school and work so I'm just having a bit of a tough time right now. I was wondering if you guys had any advice on dealing with cravings and getting this monkey off of my back once and for all

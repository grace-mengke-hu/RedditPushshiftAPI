Failed on day 2, doubts ..

Hey there guys,
first of all I am not really sure that I want to stop smoking because I (guess I) enjoy about 3 of the daily 20 cigs i smoke. The image of me, smoking at the bar while drinking whiskey is tempting. Or the first cig that goes with the morning coffee. But due to money and health I have decided to quit. 

I stayed smoke free for about 35 hours and while i was doing fine, from time to time the thought "but you enjoy smoking" arose in my mind. Got pass it until I met with 3 freinds, 2 out of which are smokers. As I inhaled a bit of their smoke, the tought "you want one' came to my mind. I shared with them that I felt like smoking, to which they responded by handing me 2 packs (they are still childish though 21yrs old, nvm).
So if so far i was doing ok, I started questioning myself, and just stared at the cigs. The doubts became bigger, so now on my mind was "what if I reduce them to 10 a day". So i smoked, felt miserable afterwards.

TLDR: 35 hrs smoke free. Went out with smoker friends, started to doubt myself hard. To this moment i had passed every craving without problems until i breathed some cig smoke and 10 minutes later i "convinced" myself that i will cut them in half and lid one up.

Is this image in my had of the 3 cigs a day that i enjoy due to the addiction and how do you overcome such doubts as in this situation?

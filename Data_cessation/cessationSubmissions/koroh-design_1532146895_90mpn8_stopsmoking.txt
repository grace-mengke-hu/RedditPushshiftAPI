Forced to quit smoking/vaping from surgery; is there anything similar to a nicotine buzz?

I recently got a septoplasty (septum surgery) and i couldn’t keep my juul down and over a few days the nicotine messed up my recovery to the point where my septum cartilage is exposed through a hole in my nose and it’s not closing up soon, so i smashed my juul to pieces and flushed it. I’m going through withdrawals and i’m craving the feeling of nicotine buzz and trying to stop myself from picking up another vape or a pack of smokes. I know it’s not smart to look for other alternatives as opposed to completely quitting but for the time being while i recover from surgery, is there anything that’s similar to a nicotine buzz (short burst of dizziness; lightheadedness)?

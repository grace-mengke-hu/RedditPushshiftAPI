Wish me luck.

Today it's been 204 days since I clicked in to get a badge. I did not quit in that time, the most time I actually made it without one was 2 days. I used the badge to remind me how many days have gone by since I decided I want to quit.  I have not succeeded. I have succeeded in telling myself I want to quit during every butt. I'm resetting today, to try and make those days actually count. Champix starts on Monday. If you have personal anecdotal experience with Champix that is positive please let me know. I'm intentionally avoiding google on this one. I want to believe it will work. And I want to quit. And I want those days next to my badge to mean more than they do now. Wish me luck.

Never thought I'd be able to quit again!!

I had quit about 8 years ago for 2 years. Had one night out with friends drinking at a bar, and slipped hard. I am now married and have a 2 year old son. Both of which are my reasons for quitting this time, aside from obvious financial gain as well. I just always doubted I'd be able to do it again after slipping so hard last time. the last 12 days have been far easier than expected and I am looking forward to the rest of my smoke free life. So even if you have slipped whether it be a drag or fell of the wagon completely, if you want to be rid of it you can be.

Im in a weird place right now.

Hello, short time lurker. Im 19 and have been smoking since 15 around 20 cigarrettes a day. Ive read allen carr's book 2 weeks ago because Ive been wanting to quit for a while now (health, money (19 with no job, im sure you can relate) but couldnt think of how it could be possible even after reading the "holy grail". Heres when this gets weird: last night I couldnt sleep well, woke up at 3 AM decided to smoke while reading some Terry Prattchet. Smoke 5 cigarrettes and then went back to sleep thinking (much like allen carr tries to teach you) "that was my last cigarrete, Im tired of wasting money and being stupid". Today, wake up. Take cigarrettes with me even tho Im not gonna smoke them. Now its after dinner and I cant tell you how easy it was not to smoke, holy shit. I dont understand, Ive been with friends who smoke, been in the typical situations where I used to smoke and, best thing is, the cravings only came significantly ONCE the whole day, at random. Only those 20 minutes were extremely hard, I even starting walking outside to light up, but went to the bathroom first and when I got out I didnt go outside and decided to (for once) try to be strong.

Now this is kind of a large post I hope you forgive me, but thats not all. Now I actually dont feel too great about (nearly) not having cravings, I still think I enjoyed some of those times smoking alone while I read or did some stuff (I know what Allen Carr says, but still). So here I am, finding it easier than ever to not smoke yet missing it, for something I feel is different than regular nicotine cravings.

Anyone had a similar experience? I know you guys would say "Dont smoke, dumbass". But Im seriously considering what to do now, after a whole day with not 1 cigarrete. I feel weird. EDIT: to make it a little bit clearer, what I feel is very similar to the "fears" that carr talks about, if you have read the book.

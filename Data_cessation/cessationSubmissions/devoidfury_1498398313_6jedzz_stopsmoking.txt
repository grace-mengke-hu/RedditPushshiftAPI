recent quit

Quit back in April, it was the ninth serious try I made. Smoked a pack a day for ten years -- those first few weeks *sucked*, but it's gotten a lot easier and my concentration is coming back.

I started going out for regular walks; between the two it's the best I've felt in years. Just wanted to share, often it takes multiple attempts. Keep at it and you'll find success.

Starting my journey

Hi guys, Ive decided to go cold turkey and try to quit smoking due to the fact that finally cigarettes have started to control me. I always thought having the odd cigarette time to time was fine and truthfully i never felt addicted or got cravings. Keep in mind i have only been smoking for about a year.
However recently walking past a local shop the urge of entering to buy a pack is so powerful! its a feeling in my chest, its horrible and i want it to go.
I know to myself that if i can complete this i can can control myself over anything!

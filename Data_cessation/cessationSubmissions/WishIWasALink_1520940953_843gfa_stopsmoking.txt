Life of a ex-smoker

44 days already ! I know it's not that much, but I feel like a completely different person ! My sense of taste and smell is one of the first/awesome changes I noticed and enjoying it every single day. I certainly started to get annoyed by cigarettes smells, and I can't believe I was the one smoking that crap just a month ago. Majority of my friends are smokers, and I am getting extremely annoyed when we hang out. The fun fact is that, just weeks ago I used to avoid hanging out with them cause of my cravings, and now, after cravings are gone, I am just getting super annoyed by the smell, and pushing them to quit.
For everyone who are trying/thinking to quit smoking, YOU CAN DO IT ! Just give yourself 2-3 weeks and you're completely different person !

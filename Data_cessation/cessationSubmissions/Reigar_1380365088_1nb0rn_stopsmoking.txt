Can't sleep

So I finished the patch treatment, and have been running clean for four days. The issue now is my sleep cycle is really goofy.  I am sleeping four hours a night.  Small things seem to wake me.  When I wake I seem to be perfectly awake, but still know I am tired.  I am just not sure what to do? I need sleep, but can't see to get any.

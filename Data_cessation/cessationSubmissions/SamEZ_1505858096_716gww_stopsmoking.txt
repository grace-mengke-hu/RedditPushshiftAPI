The amount of time you're saving as a non-smoker!

When we were smoking it never seemed like we spent that much time smoking cigarettes, just 5 minutes here or there throughout the day... but I think as any of us who have started to go without know, in addition to the money, another very real cost to them was the crazy absurd amount of time they cost us both literally, and away from those we care about, or experiences we enjoy.

With that said let's take a look at how much time I've wasted the past 9 years of my life as a smoker. I'm using guesstimates of 5 minutes per cigarette, and twenty cigarettes a day.

* Each day: 5 x 20 = 100 minutes
* Each week: 700 minutes or 11.6 hours
* Each year: 36,500 minutes or 608.3 hours or 25.3 days spent with a cigarette in my mouth...
* Over the past 9 years: 328,500 minutes or 5,475 hours or 228.1 days with a cigarette in my mouth...
* If I were to continue to smoke another 35 years until it killed me: 1,277,500 more minutes or 21,291.6 hours or 887.2 days with a cigarette in my mouth...

I for one never thought of cigarettes as eating up quite so much of my time until crunching these numbers.

Think about it this way... to master a skill requires about 10,000 hours of work. If I hadn't been mastering a slow death I'd be more than halfway there... If I continued to smoke I'll likely miss out on reaching high levels of proficiency with at least two of my hobbies...

Thanks but no thanks, I think I'll take my life back.

Quitters, how do folks treat you differently?

When I was a smoker, I was painfully aware of the smell that clung to me and the stigma. For many years, I was a closet smoker and would tortuously wait all day until I could smoke after work without anyone knowing. Before that, I was a smoker in college and I am sure many looked down on me for it, especially the faculty. Now that I've been a nonsmoker for some time and folks I work with have no idea I used to be a smoker, I hear comments about smokers. For instance, this week a coworker came to get me to help out with a customer and she said "Watch out though, he smells strongly of cigarettes." I overheard a group of college kids walking by on the sidewalk ridicule someone for being a "gross smoker." I see smokers sitting on curbs and around dumpster areas or in bushes where folks won't notice them and make them put it out. 

It was odd to see that people really do think of smokers differently and treat them differently. It's nice to not worry about getting treated like a second class citizen just because of a nicotine addiction. Have you noticed changes in the way people treat you since you quit?

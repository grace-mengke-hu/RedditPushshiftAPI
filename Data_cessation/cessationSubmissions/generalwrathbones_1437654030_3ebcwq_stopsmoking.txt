Two weeks, I think it is either smoke or quit my job

My boss smokes, coworkers smoke, I have immense mental associations between smoking and virtually every aspect of my job.
Been working here fifteen years, smoking the whole time. 

Without cigarettes all day and some drinks at night (stopped that too), it's almost impossible to perform the tasks I need to do, and/or give a shit about them anyway. 

It's not the best job in the world as far as pay or benefits by a long chalk. I live paycheck to paycheck but I have some assets squirreled away; I could quit and live OK for several months while finding a new one. What is more important, my LIFE or my life?

Just babbling, listening to white noise on headphones and chewing a wad of dip so I can drag myself out of the house and face the dozen things I should have done yesterday.

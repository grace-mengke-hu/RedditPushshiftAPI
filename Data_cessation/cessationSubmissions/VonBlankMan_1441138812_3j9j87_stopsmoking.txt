Small tip that helped me a lot in quitting

I noticed that a big mistake is to think you "restrict" yourself from nicotine, and whenever you get a craving you probably think "must resist, must not smoke" etc. But that, in turn, only makes you crave for the cigarette much more since it becomes like this forbidden fruit type of thing.

What you need to do is, whenever you get a craving, think not "I must resist the temptation" but "I *decide* not to smoke even though I am craving for it". Somehow, saying that you *decide* not to smoke makes you feel very in charge of your craving and the feelings associated with it, and the craving isn't as hard anymore. After a few days it became my default outlook and after two weeks or so I pretty much started doing it subconsciously. Good luck!

Struggling. Still. Physical symptoms

I posted yesterday but didn't explain myself very well. 
I am on day 14. I feel wonderful mentally. My body feels terrible, I would really appreciate hearing if anyone carried on having physical symptoms 2 weeks in. I mainly feel sick, tired, stomach ache and just ill. Oh, and I don't sleep.

I keep going for a run or to the gym and I don't do as well as I get so tired half way through. 

I would really like to hear someâ€‹ turn around positive stories from people to keep my motivation going and to have hope that I will feel better soon

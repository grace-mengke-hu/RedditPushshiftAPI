Guys/Gals, quick question from those who are experienced quitters (Don't upvote)

So, I will make this quick and easy. I quit cold turkey July 18th, 2014. Some background: I am a college student and am obsessed with mental stimulation. I used to both dip (chew tobacco) and smoke. I dipped far more often due to school work; I only really smoked when I was around my GF. As of today, I feel absolutely wonderful. I can smell, I can breathe, and I can taste the difference between shit food and good food. However, I am still having crazy-wild cravings for stimulation. I've been slamming coffee and tea everyday since I quit. I look at a cig and feel disgusted that I used to regularly inhale that "thing." But, I'm starving for stimulation.... its how I function. 

Question: Its been over two weeks since I have ingested nicotine. Is it normal to still be having cravings this severe? If so, what are some tips to help curb my lack of stimulation?

I've cleaned my apartment twice, my mother's house once, reorganized my life (calendar), cleaned my guns, reconstructed my BOB, ordered my college books, planned dinner for the next week, etc.... I can't find anymore things to do that will keep my mind off of not having nicotine.  

EDIT: Hey all. Apologies for my delay, I am currently at work. I can't thank you all enough for the comments. I'm off my crazy caffeine high today and a bit more relaxed. I'll shoot out some replies when I get home in about an hour.

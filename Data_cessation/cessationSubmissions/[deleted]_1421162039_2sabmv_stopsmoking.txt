Introducing myself at 8 days in. 34F

Just wanted to say hello to everyone after lurking for a while, and tell my story. Maybe there's someone out there just like me and we can share support. 

I started smoking when I was 19 and I spent my 20's smoking and drinking like it was my job. In my early 30's I had two babies in rapid succession; I managed to quit while pregnant but started back both times. My life is really stressful and busy and on top of that, in the past few months I started having serious worries about my health. My love for my kids is so overwhelming and I started having serious anxiety about something being wrong with me, about getting sick and leaving them behind. Guess how I dealt with that anxiety? 

A typical night for me and my husband after the kids go to bed would be to grab a drink, go out on the porch, and light a cigarette--and spend the next 1-4 hours doing the same thing. One morning I woke up with the epiphany, FINALLY, that smoking is behind all this. My health worries, my feeling like crap, my never getting anything done on my to-do list because I'm either outside smoking or feeling too awful to do it. I'm done. My husband isn't ready yet and it's causing some disconnect between us, but I hope he'll come around soon.

I've read some of Carr's book (which is great) but haven't had the time to finish, but the big thing was when I saw someone post about whyquit.com. After reading the story of the 33 year old woman who died of lung cancer and left behind her baby, I was in tears. I don't want my kids to grow up motherless. I'm unbelievably distressed just thinking about it. I can only hope and pray that I haven't done too much damage already.

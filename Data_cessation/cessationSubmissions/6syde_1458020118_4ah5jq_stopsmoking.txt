Using Cannabis Products to Quit

If youre already a user of cannabis and cannabis products use these as tools to deal with withdrawal. I find that a session off of my portable vaporizer or a simple joint is enough to kill the tobacco cravings. You'll get your fixation to smoke without the bullshit in cigarettes. Not to mention THC helps to smooth out tension caused by quitting. It doesn't end there, I'm around the end of my third day and I've been getting extremely intense stomach pain and cramps. These fits are lasting hours, hard to get anything done with this amount of discomfort and pain. I found that an edible product, I was dissolving THC chocolate bars into my tea when I had stomach aches and it smoothed it out in about 20 minutes due because of the faster absorption of a liquid medium. Altogether feeling great when not experiencing intense cravings, however finding it hard to concentrate on anything for too long. Hopefully this will help those who already use cannabis on the day-to-day and would like to quit cigs.

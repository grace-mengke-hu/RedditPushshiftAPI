Just decided to stop using tobacco, figured I should post so I can feel held accountable!

Hey /r/stopsmoking! 

I chose to stop all tobacco yesterday. I was just a social smoker, in fact I promised myself a while ago I would never buy a pack, and I haven't. I used to smoke cigars about once a week, as well as hookah. Then I started rolling joints with tobacco, and smoking those about once a week. Now I'm traveling Europe, and about once a week (or about every 5 days) I would smoke after drinking out with new friends. 

What really got me to stop, aside from not wanting to be a smoker, we're those awful "social smoking is a trap" adds on TV. I hated seeing them, I found them cringe worthy, but over time they made me realize that I was in the exact situation they were depicting. 

After smoking I tend to not get any craving until a few days later, then it builds until I give in while slightly drunk. I don't drink on a daily basis, but when I do it makes it so much easier to give in. 

I'm posting today just to put my story out here. I believe in my ability to not give in. I never break promises I make to myself and I don't intend to start, but I want to make sure I stay true. If I have a bunch of people counting on me not to smoke, and believe in me, I think it will be easier to overcome my cravings. 

These cravings are tough, and I'm hardly a smoker to begin with. I respect those of you who have managed to stop after smoking far more regularly. 

Thanks in advance for the support guys, I'll be sticking around for some time :)

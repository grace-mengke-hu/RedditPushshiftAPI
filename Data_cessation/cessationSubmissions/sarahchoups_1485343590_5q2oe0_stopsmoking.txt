I miss the smoke sensation?

So I am (was) a heavy smoker. 35 cigs/day and I'm 29. I started this NHS study where you are put either on NRT or vapes. I am on the patches. I can forget to wear the patches and I'm fine. The one thing I really miss is the smoke on my lungs, like not the cigarette itself but I could vape and I would feel better. Main issue is work, I miss being able to get out of my team for a while. My line manager has stated that since I don't smoke anymore there is no reason for me to go out. Now my team is the kind that follows me to the bathroom to tell me stuff. This is day 5 I can't fall again. I am not supposed to vape on this program but I am a bit desperate ... any help?

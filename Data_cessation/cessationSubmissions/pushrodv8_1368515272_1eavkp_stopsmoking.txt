Maybe this time I'm serious?

I just turned 30. I've been seriously wanting to stop smoking since a year or so, but managed to stop for a couple of weeks at a time without relapsing. My father is not a smoker and has never been, but always  told me that his friends all regret ever having smoked, and that at their age they feel its burden every moment.


I smoke some 5-6 cigarettes a day on average. Some days are more stressful so I end up smoking more, and some weekends I barely smoke. Anyway, yesterday I woke up at around 4a.m. with a heartbeat and my breathing was less than optimal. It wasn't stress, things are more or less ok these days. So I thought to myself, I really don't want this to be a constant feeling in the future. I can barely remember the last time my chest felt great, and my mouth tasted "organic". I miss that, and I want it back. Maybe this time I'll become a non-smoker again.

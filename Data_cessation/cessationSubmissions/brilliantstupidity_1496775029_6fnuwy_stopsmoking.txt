Non-smoking in Paris??

So I'm gonna be abroad in Paris next semester (September to December) and I'm SO pumped.. just have one problem. I'm 122 days quit (also dope) after smoking ages 15 to 20 and I'm so glad to be done. However, I'm really not sure if I can keep it up in a city where I've heard *everyone* smokes socially. Especially considering that smoking has always been a crutch for my social anxiety, I can't see how I'm gonna be able to hold up against the temptation to start again *and* make friends! 

Any words of advice for this socially awkward ex-smoker heading to a city full of social smokers?

3+ Months, Wanted to share my experience.

I had my last smoke at about midnight on 3-21-17.  I really enjoyed smoking, but was fed up with its negative effects.  When I finally committed to quitting, I found that gum and lozenges were extremely useful in helping me break the habit. I then started to use these products on a regular scheduel to avoid the nicotine withdraw symptoms.  I slowly found myself naturally cutting back.  I'm down to 3 or 4 pieces of 2mg gum or lozenges a day, only using these products when the nicotine craving is at its strongest.
Even though I am not nicotine free, and still LOVE the smell of tobacco, however I can't imagine smoking again. Being able to breathe easy and not having to sneak outside or worry about running out has been extremely liberating.  Hopefully within another month or two I will have cut out the gum and feel complete as a non smoker.

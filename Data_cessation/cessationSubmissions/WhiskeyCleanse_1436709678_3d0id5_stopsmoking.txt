Feels good, Is Good

I'm at the point where I'm really noticing what I have been missing for the last 8-9 years. My lungs are so much cleaner and I can taste and smell more. I went for a run the other day and felt incredible afterwords. I caught a whiff of a smoker buddy of mine right after he had a cigarette and it nearly knocked me over (can't believe I smelled so terrible all the time). It is hard but so worth the effort. Thanks for all the support! Hang tough!

No clue why I'm here..

No clue why I'm here. I don't intend to stop smoking. But every time I take a drag my own little miserable world becomes worse. I guess I'm just, venting. 
Every time something goes wrong in my life, my lungs shake. My heart beats faster. My head races with thoughts. And then when I light up, my head slows down. My lungs take a kind seat. My thoughts no longer are thoughts, for now my attention is diverted to the beautiful thick white smoke that fills up my lungs and quiets my loud mind. I can't imagine not having something between my two dirty fingers every morning, every evening, and every night. This world is just too much for me to handle. Everyone I be with.. it be friends or girls, they want too much out of life. And they expect me to have the same mindset. While I, want nothing. Besides.. peace of mind maybe. Not really something I can come by on the market. But I'm sure If I could, I'd drop a pretty penny on it. I'd just like to be in my own little corner, where I don't worry about seeing my ideal future. 
I'm contented with seeing the smoke dance as the light hits it. And as I hit my cigarette. 
I want to stop. But I don't know the darnest way how. 
And frankly, the lines are blurred now and maybe I don't know the darnest reason why.

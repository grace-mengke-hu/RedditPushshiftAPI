Went out drinking and didn't smoke!

It's been a little over 3 days since my last puff. Last night I went out with friends I hadn't seen in awhile. Some are smokers, all of us were drinking. It was the first time I had been out drinking since I quit but I fought through the cravings, even the really harsh ones! I know it's only been 3 days, but I was really proud of myself.

Every time I got a craving, I just kept repeating my new mantra: "I am not a smoker."

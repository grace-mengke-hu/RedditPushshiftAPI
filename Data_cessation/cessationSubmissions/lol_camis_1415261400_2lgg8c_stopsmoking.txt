I didn't even realize smoking was the cause of my chronic nasal congestion until I quit

I searched for this sub purely for the sake of saying this....I've smoked since I was 19.  25 now, and been transitioning to e-cigs for about a year but having a hard time giving up cigs completely.  There was never a prolonged period where I went completely without cigarettes until recently...and when I did, I noticed my nose wasn't plugged like it usually was.  it stayed this way for several days....until I hung out with a friend who smoked, so I smoked a few that day.  Lo and behold, I had a stuffed nose that night.  The following few days I didn't have access to cigarettes, and the stuffed nose went away, and I finally made the connection.

anyway I know this seems insignificant, but it's one of the many short-term benefits I get from not smoking.

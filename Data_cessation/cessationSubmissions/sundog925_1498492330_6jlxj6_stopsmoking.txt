Today is my 1 YR smoke-free ðŸš«ðŸš¬

Long time lurker.  
First time poster. 
I can't believe the road it's been to get to this moment. 
If you're thinking of picking up that cigarette again, DON'T. 

Just remember it's one day at a time. And today, you're closer than ever to where you want to be and further away from where you were. 

Stay strong lads.

My fingers smell...

...like nothing! No more disgusting tobacco smell forcing its way into my nose every time my finger gets close to it. Its honestly surprisingly nice. I had just gotten so used to my fingers smelling like tobacco at all times.

Another unexpected but positive benefit to quitting! Every time I smell my finger I get reminded how shitty I used to smell.

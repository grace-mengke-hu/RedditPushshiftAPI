Legs hurting at night?

On day 3 of this most recent quit. I've quit several times before, sometimes for a few months. The only real side effect that I've ever had is MAJOR restless and prickly legs at night. I can only sleep a few hours. Anyone have any similar problems or heard of this issue before?

Officially 14 days of not smoking, now what????

Hi, I've been smoking 1 pack of a day for about 6 years now and I quit 14 days ago and it's getting slightly easier as the days past. Some days are harder then others, but it's whatever.

I'm not sure exactly why I quit in the first place. I guess to shut my family up, lol.

But ya, I'm pretty much over the whole smoking phase, but I don't feel accomplished really.

More than 1 year smoke free!

Logged in after a long time and realised I am 367 smoke free. 
Can't express it in words how good I feel without this horrible addiction. Everything changed, literally everything. 
Stay strong for the ones commencing the non smoking journey. It's so worth it! If I could do it, u can as well.

I'm absolutely terrified

I quit smoking cigarettes 1 year and 9 months ago, with the help of vaping nicotine.  I'm happy to know that I'm no longer addicted to whatever other nasty chemicals were in cigarettes, but giving up nicotine terrifies me the most.   

Usually when my 120ml bottle gets about half way, I order another one.  This is the first time I'm not ordering one.. My bottles empty, and what's left in my tank is all the nicotine I have left.  I feel like the walls are caving in on me again. 

 I smoked cigarettes for 13 years, and Vaped HEAVILY for this last 2 years - and I mean like all day vaping.  I'm 33 years old so I've been dependent on nicotine for half of my life.  I know this doesn't exactly constitute as "Stopsmoking" but it's a very similar addiction and I didn't know where else to get support.  The degree of the addiction is no smaller in size than when I was on cigs.

I no longer want to be a slave to nicotine.  I want to be free, and finally liberate the parts of my thought processes that are chained to oral fixations every 10 seconds.  I want whatever brain chemistry and physical state that has been altered through the years to return to being healthy and stable. 

Today is the day, and I need encouragement

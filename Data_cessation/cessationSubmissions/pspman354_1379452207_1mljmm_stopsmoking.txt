Went on a road trip with smokers a few days ago

insisted windows were fully rolled down and everyone blow out the window, but still think I caught some second hand smoke. Been feeling a little off these couple of days and anxious and tense like im craving nicotine. do you think that was enough to cause withdrawal. I will never ride with smokers again.

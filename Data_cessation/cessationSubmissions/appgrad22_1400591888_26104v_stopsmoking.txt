So I've been on bupropion for a month now and...

it's been great!  I've gone from a pack a day down to 2-3 a day.  

However, I can't seem to get over that last hump.  I've gone as low as 1 a day, but I feel like an addict in Trainspotting when trying to go a whole day without smoking.  I shake, pace around, watch the clock EVERY second, my feet can't stop rubbing while sitting, my hands are constantly gripping at nothing, my eyes dart, etc.  It is virtually impossible for me to go from 2 to 0.  

I keep telling myself I'm poisoning myself, I'd feel better without it, I'd be able to do my job better, I'd be healthier, etc.  I know I need to quit and I want to quit.  The satisfaction of having that smoke is A-MAZING!  But gross and poisonous.

Any ideas?  Any similar stories?

P.S. Been smoking 18 years.

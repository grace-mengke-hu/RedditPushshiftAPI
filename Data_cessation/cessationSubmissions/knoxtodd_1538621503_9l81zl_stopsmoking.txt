Apathy/Lack of Interest in Hobbies

Hey all,

So the whole process has been pretty stressful, and I've had many cravings and bouts of irritability. But, I'm keeping true! Anyways, I've been feeling pretty depressed and have had little interest in my hobbies. I have been told this is normal, and have been living with GAD and depression most my life. **But if anyone can share their experience and when I can expect it to end, I'd be so grateful!** Thanks all, and keep strong!

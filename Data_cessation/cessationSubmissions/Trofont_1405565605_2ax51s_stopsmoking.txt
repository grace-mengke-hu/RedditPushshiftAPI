Been awhile

I havent posted in a while (not that I posted much.) I'm closing in on 200 days and im unbelievably proud of myself. I still think/miss smoking every once and a while but ita never a craving. Its more like a reminiscence than a want. I guess im just here to tell the freshly quit that it gets better. It takes some time, but it goes from a craving to a want, and from a want to a memory.  Stay strong guys. Smoke free 2014!

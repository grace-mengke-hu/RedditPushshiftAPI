What's your favorite Stop Smoking app?

Note: my apologies about not having a badge, I'm on mobile and am not sure how to do that. I'll look into it when I get home from work. I have been smoke free for 8.5 days.

What is your go-to app to track your quit? I've been using "smoke free". I don't hate it, but I've noticed that there are so many options out there. I honestly chose "smoke free" because it is free and hasn't had a lot of advertisements. I'm interested to see what you have to say.

Note 2: Even if no one sees this post, I just wanted to put it into the reddit-universe that this sub has really been helping me.

My story: I'm a 26 year old who had been smoking for 9 years. I was recently in the ER for a virus. I was there for 12 hours. Since it was the ER all of the rooms were open and you could hear the doctors speaking to patients. For 12 hours I heard every single doctor ask every single person about smoking habits. Then, there were multiple stroke victims. Some had family with them, some did not. It really started to sink in that the likelihood of me becoming one of the stroke victims would really multiply if I continued down this path. Having the families of stroke victims present really made me despise the idea of being a burden on any loved ones. I also overheard stroke victims (a daughter of one) talking about the things that her mother could no longer do since her stroke. Imagining a life of discomfort was also something I do not want. It was a horrible day. I'm sure my mood was affected due to where I was and being severely dehydrated; But, I'm not sure I've ever had a shift in thought so severe in all of my life. If it is a part of the human experience for the body to eventually deteriorate, I would prefer that it happen as late in life as possible, and that I experience as little discomfort as possible. If I continue to smoke, most likely, the opposite will happen. Even if no one reads this, it felt good just to type out the words. 

I want to do this. I will do this.

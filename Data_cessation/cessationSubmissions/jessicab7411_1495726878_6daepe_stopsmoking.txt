365 days!!! How cool is that? The freedom from nicotine and smoking is indescribable!!

The title pretty much says it all!! Except......thank you fellow stop smoking redditors! It really helped to come here some times several times a day, sometimes only daily and sometimes I had to avoid you because it made me think about smoking way to much (not really sure why that happened). But now I love being supporting and encouraging to everyone! I honestly don't know if I would have been able to do it without you!

My advice don't give up!!! I PROMISE everyday it gets so much easier. I remember looking forward to going to sleep just because I knew that the next day would be easier. And never ever think you can have just one cigarette......9 times out of 10 it will eventually lead you back to smoking fulltime. And find a goal. I booked a cruise for next year, I am making payments on it. That is my reward. And do you have any idea what it feels like to not wonder where I can go to smoke while on vacation. Instead I asked our vacation planner if smoking was allowed on the balconies because I really don't want to smell it when I am relaxing taking in the ocean view. How awesome it that?!?!!!!

But like I said in my title the FREEDOM is amazing. Nothing has a hold over me anymore!

One more thing my kids........it feels great that they are so proud of me. What a gift I am giving not only me but them! 

Thanks again for all the support on here!! YOU CAN DO THIS!!! It really comes down to how bad you want it!!

After 20 years I am officially 1 week smoke free!

Started smoking about 20 years ago and today marks 1 week smoke free.  I feel great and very proud of my accomplishments.  It was hard to envision myself quitting and surprisingly it was not as difficult as I feared it was.  If only I had gotten over my fear and done this sooner!  What I really want to say is thanks to this community for all the support.  I read Allen Carr's book which I think played a huge role in my ability to quit and change my way of thinking.  This past weekend was one of the most stressful and emotionally difficult times in my life (for other reasons) and yet I never picked up a cigarette! Cheers to a smoke free future!

Smoking heavier than ever. Desperately want to stop.

I've smoke since I was eighteen with a six month break one year in college but the gum kills my jaw (tmj) and my insurance doesn't cover the patch. I blame my heavy smoking on current life circumstances but I know it's a poor excuse. Anything anyone could propose as a substitute would be fantastic, a small wrench into the gears of my smoking machine if you will. Help.

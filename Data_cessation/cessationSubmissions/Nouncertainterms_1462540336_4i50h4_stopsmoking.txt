Just some thoughts

Hello guys, and congratulations on your decisions to quit smoking! I'm 27, been smoking for 10 years, and am on day 3 of my quit. Got a ways to go but I thought I'd share some thoughts on my journey so far. I went from a pack/pack and a half a day to zero, cold turkey. This has been very difficult, but not in the way I imagined it would be.

I always knew the mental addiction was what kept me coming back for more. I was certainly physically hooked, but that was less of the problem. I've made some major changes in my life recently (quit drinking, quit nail-biting (mostly), been going to the gym) and it's really boosted my confidence. Knowing that I *have* the power to quit has been instrumental. 

On my quit day I asked my cousin for advice (she's on 2 months) and she gave me some real good ammo. Obviously, we need to want this. I think cold turkey is tough, but highly efficient. Just get it over with. 

Oddly, the thing I'll never forget is she told me to think about cigarettes as like a binky for a big baby. When I started thinking about it like that it transformed the way I viewed cigarettes. It became a crutch, a fucking weakness, and nothing else. I realized I had invested so much time and money into a relationship that was literally destroying me from the inside out and offering nothing more than a quick high. 

Anyway, like I said, I'm early into the breakup, but I've never been so sure of anything in my entire life. We're better than this guys. I know we can do it, and I'm proud of us all for making the decision. Keep at it!

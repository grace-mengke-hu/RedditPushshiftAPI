Smelled the Leaves for the first time in a Lonng Time.

I quit about 3 weeks ago through the use of e-cig (as a form of nicotine replacement. I've never felt so happy and healthy, and I can't wait to reduce my dosage until I don't even need that anymore. But for the first time in three years I smelled the leaves in the Fall and I could not be any more excited. I forgot how great the world around me could smell!

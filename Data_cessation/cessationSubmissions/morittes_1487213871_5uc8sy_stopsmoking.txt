20 year old smoker-need incentive to quit

I'm a 20 year old college student and I've been smoking regularly for about a year. Right now I'm at about a half pack a day. I know smoking is bad for me and will affect me later in life if I continue but I'm struggling to get motivated to quit. My main struggle is the recurring thought that since I'm young I could still smoke for a few years and quit and I'll have time for my body to repair itself and not face the consequences of my habit when I'm older. This thought has been stopping me from quitting-why should I quit now if I enjoy it and probably won't affect me later if I quit in a few years? Life is short so I might as well enjoy it right? Someone please give me some reasons to quit now.

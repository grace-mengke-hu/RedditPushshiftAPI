Smoking my last cigarette. I'm somewhat concerned.

This is the last cigarette of the last pack I will have. I turned on some nice music and believe me, I'm taking my time with this smoke. 

But I don't want to smoke anymore. I'm 20. I started when I was 17. Already it makes me feel sick. It doesn't help my stress but it only makes it worse as of lately. 

But I'm concerned about quitting. Long story short, I suffer from general anxiety disorder, chronic depression, and ptsd. Last time I tried to quit I got terrible night sweats and had to fight off terrible suicidal thoughts. Despite my mental instability I am never suicidal. But the withdrawals stir up scary demons from within me.

I'm going to do my best. I went to the store to buy a carton but instead splurged on magic booster packs and a couple of DnD additions. I can do it this time. But I'm hoping the mania doesn't absolutely destroy me as every other time has.

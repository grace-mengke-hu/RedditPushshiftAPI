7 days smoke free!

 After 15+ years of smoking I have decided to quit! Cigarettes are part of my identity and routine. I am going to embrace this strength that I feel to stop and use my will power to start new healthy habits. With many failed attempts in the past, this time I am ready to no longer live life being a slave to cigarettes. Change happens with change!

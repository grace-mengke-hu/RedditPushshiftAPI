5 days of no smoking - worried about weekend!

So I finally did it and promised myself last Sunday night no more cigarettes!! I'm 5 days smoke free and I've been doing so well with little to no withdrawal symptoms and minimal cravings. I kept super busy with work and I think I developed a compulsive cleaning disorder (lol) but I made sure to not have any of those down moments when I would usually go outside and have a smoke. Unbeknownst to those close to me, I actually started to quit weeks ago cutting back to just a few cigs a day and I'm pretty sure that helped me with the nicotine withdrawal. 

BUT this will be the first weekend... and I'm a little worried that the temptation will smack me in the face and I'll cave. I suppose I should remove the normal temptations like going out for drinks :( 

So..... any advice for getting through social situations in this early stage of quitting?

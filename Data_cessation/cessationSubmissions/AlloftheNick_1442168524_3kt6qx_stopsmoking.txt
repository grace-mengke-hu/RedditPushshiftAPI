All my friends smoke. What do I do?

Today is day one of no more cigarette buying. I'm allowing myself until October 1st to completely quit. But the hardest hurdle for me to pass will be my friends who smoke. I hang out with them daily and smoke with them daily. What do I do?  Have any of you been in a position where you are afraid to hang out with friends who smoke?

Smoked for 2 years, 5 days since last cigarette and feeling strong!

Smoked between a half a pack and a pack a day for two years. Tried quitting several times with no luck. Realized a sudden decision to quit wasn't going to be enough, I actually had to WANT to quit. Well I found my reason and my will and I know its only 5 days since my last smoke but I have found myself not thinking about ciggs throughout the day and I think this time around I can do this!

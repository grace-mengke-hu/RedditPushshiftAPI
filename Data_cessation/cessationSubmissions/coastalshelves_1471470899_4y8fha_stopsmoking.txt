Day 1

I've been (very) half-heartedly giving up smoking for the best part of this year. I'll quit for a few hours, days, even weeks. Then I'll buy a pack, smoke one, and throw it away, disappointed with myself. The next day, I'll buy a pack, smoke a few, then throw it away. The third day, I'll smoke the whole pack. For a while, I quit smoking during work hours, then I started again. For a while, I quit smoking outside work hours - then I started again. For a while, I'd only smoke at the bar, or with certain friends, or on certain occasions, then I'd start again. Recently, I've pretty much been smoking all the time.

And I'm really fucking done with this bullshit. I just threw out what was left of my last pack, and I do not want to ever start again. 

I've been reading here on and off for a while, and your stories have been helpful and inspiring, but clearly just reading them isn't enough for me. So here I am telling you all that I'm going to bed a non-smoker, and tomorrow I will not buy another pack. Wish me luck.

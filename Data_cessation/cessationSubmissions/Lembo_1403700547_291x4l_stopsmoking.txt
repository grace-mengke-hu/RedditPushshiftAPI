Quitted for 4 months, then relapsed for 4 months. Stopping again today. Wish me luck!

Today I'm getting my badge again! After a succesful non smoking period I relapsed after a holiday with smokerfriends... Then I had university finals and didn't have enough willpower. Yesterday was my last examination, went out, got drunk, smoked a whole pack. My last pack. I'm sick of it. Holiday has begun and no postponing anymore! This subreddit helped me the last time. When it was difficult I cam lurking here and I'm sure you guys will be a big help also this time!

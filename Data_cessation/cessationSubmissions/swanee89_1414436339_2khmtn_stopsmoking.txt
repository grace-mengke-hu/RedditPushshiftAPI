Decided to quit smoking.

I'm broke, have a 6 month old, single income and starting to develop a cough so I decided to quit smoking. I was smoking about a pack a day, more if I was drinking. 


Good news is that my fianc√©e decided to quit smoking with me. I had my last cigarette last night at 11:00 pm. As of now my throat doesn't like me very much. 


Here goes nothing...

One week.

I finally switched to an e-cig at 12% nicotine from a pack every two days habit. It's been a week and i haven't wanted a real cigarette since switching. I'm planning on staying off cigarettes for a few months, then scaling the nicotine down to 6%. 

It feels good guys. I'm getting there.

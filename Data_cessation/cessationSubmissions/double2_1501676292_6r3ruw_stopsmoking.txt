4 months nicotine free last week after 15 years as a regular smoker/vaper. Nice to feel so confident I'll never go back.

I've been a subscriber on here for years and this is the longest I've gone nicotine free since being on here by a long chalk. I used to be an e-cig user which probably helped me finally quit, but tended to bring me back to cigarettes when the e-juice no longer was hitting the spot. Believe it or not, I live in a smokey environment and constantly hang around with people smoking. I also still drink as freely as I like. Personally I am very happy how little I have had to change of my lifestyle and how I don't need others to work around me.

I can't recommend the Easyway books enough. Whilst I've met a number of folk who have read the book and it didn't work, it seems those who are a little older have a very high success rate, for one reason or another. I read the book and no longer felt the need to smoke.

I don't for a second think that I will ever smoke again. I realise than any cigarette, e-cig, patch, gum - in my situation - is just a way of kickstarting a cruel and dominating cycle of addiction. I feel completely empowered to avoid ever being tricked in to returning to that pattern of behaviour. 

Good luck to everyone else in the same boat or perhaps a few steps behind. You'll get there eventually as long as you WANT to!

I'm tired.

8 Years and a pack a day strong.  I'm tired:  tired of excuses, tired of sneaking out, tired of disappointment, but mostly tired of smoking.

I just finished Allen Carr's audiobook (twice) and I'm ready for this.

Thanks to you all for your indirect encouragement.  I've been lurking here for a few weeks now and it's amazing what you people are accomplishing.

I had my last one this morning and survived my first day of work without breaking.  i know it'll take a lot of effort but I'm prepared for this.

Again, thanks to you all.

Advice

I am the SO of a smoker. He has been smoking for a few years now.  (we are mid 20's, military, a kiddo and another on the way.) It has gotten to the point, he goes through a pack a day. Due to work changes he cannot smoke as often, so now he dips at work, smokes outside of it. I'm very concerned about the nonstop stream of nicotine. He has tried quitting so many times. And he tries hard as he can. A few hours without it is enough to make him EXTREAMLY irritable. I'm trying so hard to be supportive every time. We both are feeling discouraged, and it's becoming a touchy subject. I understand the enjoyment of the activity, and to a small extent, the addiction. I used to smoke, but very moderately. Quit cold turkey when I found out I was pregnant with our first son. And again with our second. (I'm fortunate enough not to suffer craving/withdrawals) I figure I will never smoke again because it would be cruel of me to ask him to break his habit and I still enjoy it occasionally, which may make him resentful/relapse. I love him with everything in me. But I don't know what else to do. I am so extremely worried about his health. I know for some, it's the hardest thing they can do. He has tried patches, gum, vaping, cold turkey, you name it. Any advice?

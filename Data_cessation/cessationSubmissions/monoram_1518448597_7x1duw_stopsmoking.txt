Question about vaping?

I have been able to quit smoking for almost 7 months,  but during this period of time I slip 2 or 3 times during stresful situations at work. In those times I really felt bad after smoking and doesn't even enjoy the cigarrette.  I felt really happy as an smoke free guy,  but for some reason the idea of smoking is always on the back of my mind.  It's like my brain is looking for excuses to make me smoke.  The problem is that I tought that after some time the idea would be dissapearing but I 'm getting anxious  that I would always live thinking about smoke.   Do you guys think vaping could be the solutions for those situations?

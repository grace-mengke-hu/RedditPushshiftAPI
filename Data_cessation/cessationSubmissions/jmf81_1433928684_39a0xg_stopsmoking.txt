FUCK OFF, Craving has been non stop for the last 15 minutes

What the fuck! I can't get this fucking feeling to go away. This feels like my first day again! I thought it should be easier by now. I've sometimes found that coming on here or reading freedom from nicotine actually makes me worse. Is it possible that by trying to help myself I'm actually making things worse by reminding myself about smoking?? 
*EDIT*
I knew I would be going to the beach with my partner. The beach is 40 minutes away. I'm so used to 'rewarding' myself with a cigarette after a journey. I think that was playing on my mind more so than reading the book or coming on here. I've just realised that I've been avoiding car journeys until now!

Smoke Free - Day 1!

Hello everyone, this is my first day not smoking and i’m already having a great feeling about quitting cigarettes. I’m 20 and I started smoking when I was around 17-18. Haven’t been a heavy smoker but there have been days when i’ve smoked a complete pack in a day. 

I have been reading many posts in this forum and i’ve read about people quitting even after regularly smoking for over 10 years, which I think is great. That helps me motivate myself, looking at all the people quitting, makes me question myself, if they can(after smoking for so long), why can’t you?

Something I wanted to know was how to cope up with anxiety while not smoking, I mean I haven’t felt anything yet but I do know i’ll be getting some bad anxiety in the coming days. A little heads up with how to deal with it, what to do and what not to would be great!

ahhh day 2 is so hard. Living in a frat house that allows smoking indoors doesn't help!

Ok so I just need to keep remembering that while I may build up that one cigarette in my head as a beautiful thing, all it will do is make my mouth taste bad, my fingers smell, and I will feel nothing but guilt. Also all it will do for me is make me want another cigarette sooner!

Struggling (but winning) 20yr smoker, 41hrs clean. Any support really appreciated

Started at 13, currently 33.

Clean for 41 hours (that's 2460 minutes, yep!)

I feel ashamed of how emotional I am. Bouts of being very cranky. Bouts of bursting into tears (that's what I'm doing now). I'm home alone so it's okay, but I dread my boyfriend coming home - being uncontrollably emotional is so shameful. I'm irrational and moody.

I'm trying to feel proud of myself, instead of ashamed of the emotions.

I'm really struggling. If anyone would write me a positive note, I'd really appreciate it.

(Now 2470 minutes free ;)

EDIT: Over 61 hours now. Been a total bitch. STILL SMOKE FREE!!
I can't thank you all enough - you've helped me so much, being there through my darkest time. You are all wonderful :)

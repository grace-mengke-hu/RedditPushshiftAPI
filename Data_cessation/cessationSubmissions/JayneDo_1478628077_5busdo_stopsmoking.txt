Quit smoking but I haven't actually left my house

I have been smoke-free for a few days now. I feel good, despite it only being a couple a days I have a considerably larger amount of energy. I tried to make it a point to stay indoors to stave off temptation. I haven't left my place since my last cigarette. This isn't good considering I am always outside for work/life whatever but I put it all on hold to deal with this. It's been 3 days. My only issue is being outside. I'm concerned I'll smoke again. Obviously I'll have to attend to my responsibilities but I'm always anxious so I do fear I'll mess up my progress if it all becomes too much. This is my first attempt at quitting after 5-6 years of smoking. All of my friends smoke as well so I just need some advice on how to maneuver around these issues!

*edit: 3 days

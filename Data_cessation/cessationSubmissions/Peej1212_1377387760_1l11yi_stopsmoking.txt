A substitute hand to mouth habit

When I quit smoking, my hands didn't know what to do, so I found them an occupation: flossing my teeth. There are a great variety of interesting flossing toys. Check them out at Amazon or any local drug store.

Get mint flavored floss-things. It helps somehow.

Floss while you are watching a video or otherwise not doing anything with your hands.

If you have a dog or cat, put used floss where they can't get it. Some of them will eat floss, and it can be damaging, even fatal.

Give it a try. It can't hurt (unless you get really vicious on your gums).

Side benefit: no cavities or gum problems. Your dental hygienist will be very impressed.

Quit smoking and you're HACKING up a lung?

Hey gang, 

I had some thoughts i wanted to share and it might help give alot of you some peace of mind as you start to quit smoking and you're noticing that you're coughing more.  

You spent the effort cutting out something toxic and now you're coughing more than when you WERE smoking. 

Seems pretty counter-intuitive right?  

1) Turns out, when you are smoking--the smoke and chemicals are actually PARALYZING the hairs that line your lung (called Cilia) that beat and stir up gunk up and out of your lungs. 

2) When you stop smoking = cilia start moving again.  BUT there's alot of gunk to clear out.  Coughing is one way your body responds to clean itself out when the cilia cannot do that. 

3) How long should the coughing last?  Really depends on how long you smoked and how much tar and chemicals from smoking are in the lungs. 

4) If you're noticing you've been coughing for a couple weeks, you have a really nasty fever, you've coughed up any blood--go book a visit to your physician to rule out a chest infection, whether you need antibiotics, puffers, or something that can be managed with something over the counter at the pharmacy. 

Hope you find this useful and helps gives a different perspective to put your mind at ease while you stay committed to your goal of becoming non-smokers  :)

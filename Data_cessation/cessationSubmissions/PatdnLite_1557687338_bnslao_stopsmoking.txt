Depression and quitting nicotine does not mix well together

I’m 5 days without nicotine and I have to say sometimes I feel like the word is against me and I can’t do anything about it. In those times I couldn’t care less for my health and think about lighting a cigarette. The only thing that keeps me from doing so is a small small light of hope that maybe if I just fight through this I will come out a different person.

Two years today.

I don't think I've ever actually posted in this sub after I subscribed some time ago. 

Honestly, and I don't mean to imply that struggling with quitting wasn't insanely difficult, out of the three substances I've let go of in the past few years, cigarettes were the hardest initially but the long term has been arguably the easiest. There have been times since I've quit where I've been impossibly stressed out and pissed off, and after years of my brain defaulting to walking out on the porch and lighting up, it's like that switch just doesn't work anymore. Even when I've consciously thought about flipping it, the reaction now is "Ugh, why? So I can cough and throw away two years?" I still hang around the smokers at work, and I've never felt seriously compelled to bum one. Don't get me wrong, the first few weeks are an absolute nightmare. I was so fortunate to have that first week off from work. If there's any advice I can give to someone right out of the gate -- isolate yourself from as many external forces as you can for the first 72 hours, bare minimum. At best, you'll lash out and be a complete shitbag to be around, and at worst, you'll find a reason to light one up. Also, go Cold Turkey. Weening may work, vaping may work, gum, Chantix -- I won't decry another method that may work for someone else. But for me, hitting a wall and not looking back worked the first and only time I tried to quit.

There's no replacement for being able to run without feeling winded, appreciating the complex taste of sushi, inhaling the scents of fresh linen and clean clothes, taking deep breaths that don't end in prolonged hacking, not subjecting my mother to stale-smoke laden hugs, and going on more dates in a single year than in the the previous cumulative 15.

For all of you starting out, you can absolutely do this.

You make the decision, stick to it, and whatever happens in your life, there is nothing bad enough that will make you choose to betray your decision.

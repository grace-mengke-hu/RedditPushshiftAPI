Day 2! Feeling a little more in control over yesterday.

First off, this subreddit is amazing. It's really helpful to hear other people's stories. Yesterday was rough. I cried all day over nothing... it's like I couldn't keep my eyes from leaking. I just kept imagining the burning of the cigarette and my brain kept telling me "hey it's smoke time." But I made it through and today is a little better. Trying to keep a positive mindset and remember why I chose to quit in the first place.

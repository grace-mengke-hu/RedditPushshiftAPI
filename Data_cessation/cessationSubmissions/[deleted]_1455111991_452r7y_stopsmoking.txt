Day 5

I now realize that work is the driving factor behind my smoking. I had no trouble the first few days when I was at home. Now that I'm back in the real world I realize why I smoke. It keeps my mind sharp. Fuck it though. There's no turning back now. If I end up screwing up at work it's worth it to stop.

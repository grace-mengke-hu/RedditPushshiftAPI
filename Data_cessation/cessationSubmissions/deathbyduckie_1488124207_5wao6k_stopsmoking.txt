I need to do this

I've always been and on and off smoker from the age of 18 (now 30). I'd usually go six months to year of smoking and then have six months to a year off before starting again. I've been smoking for over three years now which is the longest I've gone and I both find it really hard to let go and sick of it. 
I decided to quit back in October and did 28 days before going out for a Halloween night out and starting again. I tried again in the New Year and did 9 days until going back to work and having one as soon as I got home. I'm at the point where I want to start going to a new gym but I can't afford to without quitting. It seems a stupid battle since going to the gym would be far better for me but it'll only be 3 times a week rather than something I can escape to every day. I'm usually fine during the nicotine cravings, I just begin to really miss it. 
I suppose some support would be helpful right now. I could finish this pack today and quit tomorrow. There's nothing stopping me other than the belief that I can actually do it.

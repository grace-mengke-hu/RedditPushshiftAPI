Today is the day

I ran out of cigarettes today and just decided not to buy a pack. Im a 3 year smoker and I am tired of being put down physically by this. I can't do the athletic things I want anymore. Today I decided that I "wasn't being lazy" by not running to the store, but just dedicated.

Relying heavily on my vape but nothing too bad right now. Tomorrow morning will be interesting though!

Missing the ritual/paraphernalia of rolling

Hi everyone, so I've stopped smoking for about a week now (3rd attempt), and I think what keeps pulling me back is the ritual. I love the act of rolling, and the different kinds of baccy pouches you can get. Being a smoker has been a part of me for 5 years now and I'm not sure how to give that up, how to give up the habit and the pretty ashtrays and the lighters ect rather than the drug?

tl;dr Rolling relaxes me and is there something you've found to replace this ritual?

edit ignore the badge, i think that's from my first time quitting.

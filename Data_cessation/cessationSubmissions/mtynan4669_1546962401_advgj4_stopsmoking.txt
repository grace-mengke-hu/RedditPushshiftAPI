The first 24 hours..

I'm 24 hours into quitting after 4 years. I know 24 hours isn't long, and 4 years isn't long.. But each hour is a victory for me.

I gotta say though, I thought this morning would be really hard with cravings. I usually wake up around 9 and smoke within ten minutes. However, this morning I woke up at 6:30am and wasn't even tired. I've decluttered my whole bedroom, thrown a way a huge bag of rubbish, done three lots of washing, and been to the Post Office to run some errands.
I've never been so productive and had so much energy doing it. I haven't thought about smoking once.

There are some downsides... I definitely can't stop eating.. I'm not even hungry but I just want a bit of everything. Also got a fuzzy head but hey ho.

Could do with some advice from those who are quitting right now.. I feel like I've gotten off lightly with cravings and side effects, will they get worse as time goes on? When will I be in a bad mood and/or really tired?

Thanks for any help, and best of luck to everyone!

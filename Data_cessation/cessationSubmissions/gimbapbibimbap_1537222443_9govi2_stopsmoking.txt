Back to smoking after starting work.

Title pretty much says it all. I've quit for 3 weeks, but then my internship started. It's a pretty stressful job, especially with the early and late shifts.

It's a mystery to me how I can be okay at managing most aspects of my life, but always go back to smoking sooner or later.

I've began to wonder if that's just my go to strategy if I need to cope with something challenging. I've basically been on and off nicotine since 15.

What do you guys do instead of smoking when you feel like you need to relax?

Smoking causes back pain?

I've had severe chronic back pain for at least a year, and always thought it was from working an office job and restaurant job, or from PMS. But I just read for the first time that smoking can make back pain worse. Does anyone have any experience with this? Did you have chronic pain that went away when you quit? My back pain is so bad that if this is another benefit to quitting, that'll be another big motivator.

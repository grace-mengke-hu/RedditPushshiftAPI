I want to quit, but really can't find a good enough reason.

I work a very stressful job. I live a very hectic, borderline-homeless lifestyle. I know smoking is bad for me but it feels as if it is my anchor. I know if I quit smoking I will have so much more resources to improve my situation but I feel that after a day of hard work and craziness sitting down in a dark place all by myself and lighting one up is what centers me. It's the only thing that's familiar to me any more, the only constant reliable comfort I have left.

I know a lot of that last paragraph is the addiction talking, and I know I will be better off if I quit. I just can't convince myself to take that first step. Can anyone who has been in a similar situation help me? I'll take any advice, I want this demon gone!

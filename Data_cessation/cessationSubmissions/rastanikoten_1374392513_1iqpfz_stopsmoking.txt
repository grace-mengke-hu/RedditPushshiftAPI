Progress Report

The urge for change came after writing a college essay on personal responsibility... 

And Jim Carrey's video Cold Dead Hand kind of inspired me a little bit.  So about 113 days ago I found the burning light inside me and just all of a sudden decided to quit smoking again after 9 years of being a smoker. I have quit cold turkey a couple of times before. I was well prepared to try again from previous attempts, which maybe totaled 7. 

I decided to start dieting seriously too. At first, I thought calorie restriction was the way to do it. I had stopped eating excessively and a lower calorie intake did not work well with my sedentary lifestyle. I was eating maybe 500-600 calories a day and stuck at a constant slightly obese weight with no energy.

I did a bit of research and started exercising seriously too. 30 minutes per day minimum, some days two 30 minute sessions. I mix high and low intensity cardio in with weightlifting and polymetrics. I just use a mat, two adequately challenging dumbbells and a jump rope for now. It seems to be getting the job done. I look better. I feel better. I have lost some weight. 

As far as smoking goes, before I started working out every day, I   cheated with a few cigarettes while drinking. I just couldn't resist the pleasure of a smoke. I am just going to let that slide. Now after 113 days, I don't even really get any noticeable cravings at all anymore. My new drug of choice is exercise. And the occasional bong rip for it's athletic recovery enhancing attributes. ;)

Did anyone get nausea/vomiting while quitting?

Sorry for double posting today. I'm feeling a lot calmer and now the headaches and dizzyness are kicking in. Thing is: I have severe emetophobia (fear of vomiting). So I'd like to know: how many of you have experienced it during the quitting journey?

THANK YOU!

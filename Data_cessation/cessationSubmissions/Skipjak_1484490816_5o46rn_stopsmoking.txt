50 days in - cravings getting stronger

Hi everyone, wanted to check in here because it's been a while.
I'm currently at 50 days smoke free.  I went through some bad withdrawal the first two weeks, but ever since then, things have been going very smooth. I was really starting to feel like a non-smoker, up untill now.

I've been getting strong cravings the last couple of days, and I don't know why. I was very close to smoking a cigarette I took from my roommate's pack. Luckily, I didn't. The one thing that makes me NOT want to smoke is my badge here on this subreddit. Wouldn't want to reset it haha.
Anyone else experiencing increased cravings after a while? Help me handle this please.

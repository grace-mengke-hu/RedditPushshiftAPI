Day 40

No cravings. Been in the big smoke today and it really is a good nickname for the place. So many flipping smokers, but it all smelled bad. 

Had an appointment to see a gym manager today. He asked me questions about my health and what exercise I do. I told him about the C25K thing I started yesterday. And he told me an antedate...which could basically be summed up as follows. **You are too old to start running**. 

*I'm sure my face started twitching.* 

Really? Wow. Well Alistair Campbell took up running at 46 and has done the London Marathon and some triathlons. 

Of course I shrivelled up and said 'yes, mr fitness guy, I guess you're right, please tell me what else I can't do'.

**Have you met me???**

Needless to say, he lost the sale and I **will** complete this challenge. Never tell a woman over 40 she **can't** do something.

So, that was my day. Still don't want to smoke.  How was your day? :))

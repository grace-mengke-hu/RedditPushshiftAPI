Dream smoking

I’m sure y’all have experienced this at some point, but I woke up in a cold sweat last night upset and confused that I was smoking a cig for no apparent reason. I’d definitely call it a nightmare lol. Anyone else experience crazy nightmares when first quitting? I’ve had em since night 1.

Ending day four today and the worst of the cravings have subsided, but that dream was crazy intense and helped to keep me from backsliding today. The subconscious knows what it wants and I just gotta stay strong. No real reason for this post just thought I’d share. We all gonna make it, much love and support!

Today I quit.

I started this year with a promise to do better for myself. I changed my diet, my exercise regime and stopped drinking. But the cigarettes turned out to be the hardest thing to quit for me. But today I'm doing it, I just smoked my last one and I have tossed out the rest of the pack. Today I quit smoking.

So my plan is to do the following.
Listen to the audio book Easy way. (I have read it once before.)
Go harder on my exercise for the coming 3 weeks. (lots and lots of running,jogging and walking.)
I will carry a pack of my favourite bubblegum with me so I can have some whenever I feel a craving. (For the after lunch,dinner,coffee cravings.)

If you have any advice for me please feel free to tell me. :)

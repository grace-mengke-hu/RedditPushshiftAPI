23 days quit, with patch and Mark 10. Now have patch glue skin allergy and tongue feels swollen/mouth metallic. Could use advice!

I quit smoking 23 days ago (almost pack a day smoker, started when I was 12, now 38) using the patch and a Mark Ten Bold E Cig. About 18 days in, started getting the patch glue allergy and itchy rash, so on day 20 I dropped from Stage 1 (21mg) to Stage 2 (14mg) patch. Starting to get the itchy rash already with Stage 2, so considering stopping the patch and just using Mark Ten. 

I am puffing on the Mark 10 ALOT more on Stage 2 then I had been, and my the sides of my tongue in kind of the middle area feels raw and swollen and metallic. 

This might be psychosomatic, couldn’t see any visual proof of swelling, but it bugs me and I’m not sure if it will get worse if I full drop the patch and just puff frequently on the Mark 10. The metallic taste might just be my gums starting to bleed again more... I’m brutal with picking at teeth and now the vaso-constrictive nature of all the smokes I’m not inhaling is gone, there is a lot more mouth blood in my life. 

Looking for suggestions/tips/whatever.

I have tried to quit smoking many times, but my heart was never really into it, so the mental part always beat me.

This time my mind is right... I don’t miss the flavor/feeling of a real cig very much, don’t mourn giving up the habit like I did on other attempts... I’m finally good with quitting, but the negative physical effects of the tools I’m using to do it are bothering me.

Anyway, thanks for your time and any possible help you can offer.

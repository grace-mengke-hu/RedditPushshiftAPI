If you quit, you help others to quit

The less of your friends smoke, the more likely you are to never start yourself. And it is like this with any other drug or habit. It is your envirionment that brings you to shit like this. A majorety of the people are just sheep and do what everybody else does in a very similar way.

I choose not only to quit for myself but also to give others the strengh to do it. Smokers often complain that everybody at work smokes or everytime they go out 80% of the people smoke. You canÂ´t change that immediately. You can change yourself and present a better version of you. If you inspire even just 1 out of 10 persons, it is a success. You started a chain reaction to better your environment, your community and the humanity.

Be the wolf that guides the sheep to a better place.

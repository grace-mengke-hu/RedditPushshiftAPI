HUGE realization this morning.(this is gonna be long,guys)

First off, I quit over four years ago, just posting this to give you guys a glimmer of what a long-term quit actually means. Last November, my 76 year old Dad started to decline due to congestive heart failure and an infection in his leg due to diabetes. I had to shuttle him back and forth endlessly to appointments and hospital, had to take over all shopping for him and my shut-in Mom. On New Year's day, 2a.m., he called an ambulance and never saw this home again. For an entire month, he fought the infection and the doctors tried everything to help his heart. The whole month I was under more pressure and stress than I've ever been in my life. He died on January 31st.  What I realized this morning is that through this whole ordeal, losing my Dad and all the agony of watching it happen: I NEVER ONCE thought smoking a cigarette could help me alleviate the stress. All those long waiting rooms, long visits with him in ICU, it never occurred to me that a smoke could make things better.  So to sum up this rant, you guys who think you'll always be addicts, it SO totally goes away. Sorry about the word wall, love you guys. QUIT SMOKING.

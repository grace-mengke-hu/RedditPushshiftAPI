Looking for the head rush but not the effect on lungs

for us smokers the main hook seems to be the initial head rush one gets when taking those first draws, which eventually wears off if you smoke half a pack/ a pack a day etc... I'd love an alternative substance (But not chewing tobacco) that could give a similar effect with less health effects on the lungs etc. 

I've been recommended a vaporizer with high nicotine amounts (not the ideal choice but better on lungs) or nicotine gum, does anyone have any experience with getting the head rush experience without smoking cigarettes?

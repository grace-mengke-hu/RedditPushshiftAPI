Dark Thoughts?

I'll start by saying that I'm still happy that I quit, 6 days into this. Also, I am not suicidal or need help. 

 That being said, does anyone have dark thoughts? I'm not nic-fitting, but I had a really really bad day. I was thinking about how dying at the end of my (hopefully) long life will be peaceful and I won't have to deal with anything anymore. As much as death by cigarettes is horrible to me, and that's not the way I want to go at all, it kind of made me feel like I'm in control. I don't feel out of control of my life. It's just a thought that passes through. 

TLDR: Really bad day, thinks about death, not suicidal.

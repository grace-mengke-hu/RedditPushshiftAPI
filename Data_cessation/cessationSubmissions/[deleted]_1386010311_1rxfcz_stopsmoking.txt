Not the first time, but damnit the last time

I've come back to cigs while drunk or otherwise enough times, I never really learn, I feel ill all the time but I feel strong enough to say that the cigarette I just had was the last one I will ever smoke.  I'm prepared to take the punishment my body will dole out over the next couple of weeks, and I've got to a comfortable point so I know I can do it again.  I was going to wait until my birthday in January due to drinking over Christmas and New Year etc but, the prospect of another month puffing away scares me.  Gym performance is dying, face is spotty and productivity is low.  I'm sick of having baccy all over the place, lighters filling my drawers and rizlas on the floor.  I'm sick of not sleeping properly and relying on having a cigarette in my hand in order to function or feel comfortable.  I'm sick of it guys, time to reclaim my life from the grasps of my mind.  Take it away, healing process.  Hit me with your best shot, i'm ready for you.

Day 7: I think I'll take my badge now

I can't believe that I have made it to day 7 of being smoke free! Honestly, its seven days longer than I expected to last. Its only been a week, but it feels like I haven't smoked for years. I was skeptical about how soon I would feel the positive effects after quitting. Pardon my language, but I feel fucking GREAT. Physically, I feel like a new man. Yesterday, I went for a run on the treadmill for ~25 mins and I didn't feel like I was gonna have a heart attack! Granted I was still exhausted, but I didn't feel like total crap afterwards. 

Mentally, things have also been getting better. The constant tenseness I had previously felt has subsided. The cravings are still there, but they have become less frequent and it has become easier to take my mind off them when they pop up. Chewing a stick of cinnamon gum or drinking a soda helps a lot. 

Because having a cigarette before sleeping was my routine for years, it is still fairly difficult to fall asleep at night. That is also when I get my worst cravings. This is when I feel I am closest to falling off the wagon. During this time, my mind tries to tell me that one won't hurt; that you'll be fine. I know if I smoke just one, it won't be the last. I would be able to fight it for awhile, but I know I would just fall back into old habits. 

The only thing to do is to keep chugging along one day at a time. Writing these posts helps take my mind off smoking.

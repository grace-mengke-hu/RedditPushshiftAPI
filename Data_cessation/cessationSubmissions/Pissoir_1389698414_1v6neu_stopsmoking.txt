2 weeks in. Considering smoking weed this weekend.

2 weeks in. Cold turkey. Everything is pretty smooth sailing so far. Except for a little insomnia and weird sleep patterns.  Cravings has been easy to overcome, and I am really starting to see myself as a non-smoker and it feels great.


I was thinking of treating myself to a little marijuana this week. Is this a risky move? Marijuana doesn't contain nicotine, so it shouldn't really set me back?

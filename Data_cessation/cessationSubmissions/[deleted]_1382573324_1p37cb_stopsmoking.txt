Quitting chew

Am I welcome here?  I hope so.
Today is day 1.  Patch.  Remarkably pleasant.
I have chewed 1.5-2 tins/week for the past 31 years.  I'm 44.  So it's been a big part of my life.  
Previous quits were six ways to Sunday, they included everything from Zyban to cold turkey.  I didn't want to go to jail for assaulting someone, so I opted for the patch.  Not too bad, pretty level all day.  I quit for about 4 months once.  

This will be long and a bunch of bullshit but I think I can do it.  I am a runner, and feel like it's holding me back.  I also want to be a better person.  I feel like I really need to take better care of myself.  

So wish me luck.  I won't be checking in a lot, I tried that on previous quits.  It worked for a few weeks and then i started to read "slip up stories" and pretty soon I'm going "F THIS, who really needs to quit anyway?!!"  LOL...

And if there is a better subreddit this should go under, please--let me know!

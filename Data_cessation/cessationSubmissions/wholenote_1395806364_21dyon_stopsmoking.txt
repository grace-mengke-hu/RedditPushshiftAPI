Need advice on peer pressure.

Well not a peer exactly. My mom decided to quit smoking with me which I think is great but she said something that bugged me tonight. After chatting at length about our 3 days without cigarettes she made a joke (half kidding I think) about how once we see each other in a few weeks that we'll just go back to smoking together. ...!!

I do NOT feel the same way and the good news is that her comment makes me want to meet the challenge and prove I can resist smoking with her. Tonight I was around my close friend and smoking pal of 6+ years and managed not to join him. 

I'm just worried that she might be right! How can I mentally prepare for when I see her?

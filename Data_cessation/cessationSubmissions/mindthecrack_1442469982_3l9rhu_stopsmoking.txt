Ex-smoker rather than non-smoker

At my last Drs check up, I mentioned I hadn't smoked for 8 months and had quit and they changed my health records to 'Ex-Smoker' not 'Non-smoker'. Can anyone advise whether this status will ever change from Ex to Non? Is there a time frame for this? Or will I always be viewed now by the medical world as an ex-smoker?

How I stopped smoking cigarettes within 2 weeks (And I don't even get cravings)!

First of all, a little bit about myself and how I started smoking cigarettes. I am a 21 years old and I started smoking cigarettes 1 year before. Believe me, these cigarettes(Nicotine) are the most addictive according to me. At least from the stuff I've tried till now!

I started smoking with a friend. We are like brothers and we do all the unnatural shit together. Like smoking cigarettes for the first time, Forcing each other to ask a random girl, Smoking weed for the first time, and everything extraordinary.

Obviously, it's very hard to get rid of this thing. However, In last 1 year, I've quit smoking 3 times in a way that I didn't even get cravings to smoke more. But once you try again after quitting, it's even harder to leave!

So, Here are the 3 ways explained with my experiences to stop smoking.

1. **Change your ways (A path to go office/home)**: Actually, this one is very very effective. Smoking is 50% habit and 50% call of the drug (Nicotine). When I used to go to the office where I used to smoke in a way because there was a shop in a way that allowed me to smoke without any extra efforts. So, I did! After few months, I changed my office location and it was closer to my home and that shop didn't come in a way! So, I totally forgot about smoking for a week or two. I didn't get cravings or I didn't face any issues without smoking. After a couple of weeks, I went to have a tea near my office space and they had cigarettes there! Voila! I started smoking again! At that time, I could have stopped myself but I didn't. Then, I started having tea 3 times in a day, sometimes 4 times. ;)
2. **Go for Trekking:** So, I was smoking multiple times a day. Now, I knew that smoking is half habit and half call of the drug. So, I thought I will find the most strict trekking club/group whatever! And I joined and went on a trek. I had 2 advantages here! First one is, Smoking was not allowed, and if you were caught smoking, they would leave you at the location without a ticket to return home, Yeah! And the other thing was, I knew that if I change my habit for few days, I will quit smoking. **One more interesting thing is**, I took few cigarettes with me because I thought I would need them. 3 days passed, I never got a chance to smoke them and on the last day, I had a chance but I was not getting cravings so I threw them away!
3. **Get a highly controlled dose of LSD (Weed will work too)**: After that trek, I was clear for a month or so. Then I went to my hometown where I knew I was going to smoke again because we all friends smoke together. I smoked multiple times a day for few days and I was again trapped in this shit. This time, I was smoking 5-6 times a day since I went to my hometown. Now, I study a lot about our brain, how it works and how drugs affect the inner workings of our brain. I tried weed many many many many times and I learned that weed can activate our sub-conscious brain or kinda make a bridge between our conscious and sub-conscious brain. So, if your desire to quit smoking is strong enough, thinking about quitting will multiply your desire and you will simply start hating cigarettes. In my experience, I never used weed to quit bad habits, but to get new ideas. Now, I got my hands on LSD and as I told you, I read a lot and do too much research regarding our brain and drugs (Only psychedelics and only specific psychedelics). This experience was a huuuuuuuuuuuuge game changer. I just quit smoking without any kind of efforts. Not only I stopped smoking cigarettes, But I became so freaking productive and understanding, It was like a life changer. **I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS METHOD IF YOU ARE GOOD WITH ABOVE GIVEN TWO HIGHLY EFFECTIVE METHODS. DOING DRUGS IS NOT GOOD IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING. IF YOU STILL WANT TO GO WITH THIS METHOD, TAKE A 1/5 OF THE NORMAL DOSE AND DO IT AFTER RESEARCHING FOR MONTHS!**

So, these are the three methods that you can use to quit smoking. I am a researcher on our brain and I do all kind of shit to understand the most powerful computer in the universe, our brain!

**According to me, Cigarettes don't do shit! If you think you are smoking because of stress, anxiety, etc**. **YOU ARE COMPLETELY TOTALLY BRAINWASHED! IT WON'T HELP WITH YOUR STRESS, BUT IT WILL INCREASE IT FOR SURE!**

Let me know if you have any questions regarding all these three methods. I would be more than happy to help!

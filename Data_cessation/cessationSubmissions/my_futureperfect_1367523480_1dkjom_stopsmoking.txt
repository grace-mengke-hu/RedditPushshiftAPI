Honest and my lost.

I hate to say this, but I have to be honest.  I am now hours from my last cigarette.  After 96 days, I have to start over.  

It seem that if I am in public socializing with friend that smoke, and that know me as a smoker, I have the urge to smoke.  Grated, this doesn't happen often.  I hate this, but really like my friends.

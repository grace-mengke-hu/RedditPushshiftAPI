I want to quit, I want to quit

I want to quit but I have a crazy overwhelming feeling when I actually come to terms that I will quit. that feeling of "omg I'm going to never smoke again". It sounds silly to be so scared of never smoking again but I know I don't want to anymore. I have in my mind that I will be without cigarettes next Monday. I guess my quit date. But the thought of the date coming up is almost looming. I have smoked for roughly 7 years. Wow. Crazy to see that number. I certainly didn't think I'd be this far in. I know people have done it for much longer and quit and been successful and you'd think id be motivated by that but worries of failing seem to trump any positivity. If anyone can give me some tips and strategies on how to have confidence and get rid of this overwhelming feeling that would be greatly appreciated.

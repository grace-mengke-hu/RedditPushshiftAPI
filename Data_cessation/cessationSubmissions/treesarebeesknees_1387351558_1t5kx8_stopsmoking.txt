I want my life and my money to belong to me again

I'm tired of dipping out of social gatherings to stand outside by myself. I had a group of friends that was mostly smokers and now I have a group of non-smoking friends. I'm tired of taking "breaks" by myself. I don't want to smell anymore. I'm tired of going missing from groups that don't know I smoke. I'm tired of being controlled by nicotine.
I've been smoking for 12 years now. I still remember my first cigarette and the dizzy head rush it gave me. I liked it. I'm not sure when it switched from recreational to addiction, but it definitely is an addiction and I'm ready to claim my life back.
I just found this sub and would like your input. What has been the worst part of quitting for you? What did you do to prepare for your quit day? Have you had relapses? What kind of support system do you have? Do you recommend cold turkey or a steady decline? Any and all input is welcome and appreciated.

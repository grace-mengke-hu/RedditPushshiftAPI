Need to quit after 10+ years of smoking! Even bought patches

I bought a pack of patches but I haven't looked at it for almost a month now. I keep telling myself that I have to read it but I don't have time when no one else is around. I feel the need to not tell people that I'm trying to quit. Been a smoker for 10+ years and have cancer in my family. 

Do patches work?

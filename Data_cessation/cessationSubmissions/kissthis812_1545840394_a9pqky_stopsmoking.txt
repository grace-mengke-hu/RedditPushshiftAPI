I made it through Christmas!

I am at 1 month 10 days 14 hrs smoke-free! I was worried about Christmas because there is usually so much going on that I run around trying to do everything myself, while a house full of people are enjoying themselves. This year I started to get worked up, but I chose to sit back and let my "adult" kids figure it out! I had a great time, smoke-free! There is a first for everything. I smoked for 41 years starting at age 12, I got this! Not another puff, no matter what!

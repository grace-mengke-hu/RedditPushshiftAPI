I WILL stop smoking!

Yo yo yo yo. Just posting to hold myself accountable for my new life goal - to be a non-smoker. I've been smoking heavily for the past four years; not just tobacco, but weed, too. God, how I love that puff... but I'm quitting cold turkey. As of tomorrow (I've been wanting to quit for a while but I continue to fail. Tomorrow is a new day and I KNOW that this time 'round, I have the motivation ((and hopefully the support, from friends both irl and on here!)) I want to be realistic with my goal so once I've smoked out my last spliff tonight, that's it.)

I usually only smoke puff if I haven't got work/once I'm home for the day, and when I'm out I smoke ciggies. 

But like I said, that's all changing tomorrow and I can't wait for the new, smoke free me. 

.... SO GIVE ME HELP AND SUPPORT, KEEP ME DISTRACTED AND JUST KEEP ME ON TRACK, REDDIT! Help get me through this first month! I'd be so grateful. :D

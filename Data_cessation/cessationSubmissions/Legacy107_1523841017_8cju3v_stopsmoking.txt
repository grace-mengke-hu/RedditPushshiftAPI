dad started smoking again

Hi Reddit. I have an issue.
About 9 to 12 years ago, my dad finally canned his smoking habits. It was great for everyone. Some time passed, and just today he started smoking again. It was outta the blue, and now he's blown through 3 Marlboro silvers in a day. Im the only one that knows. I'm only 16, but how the HELL can I convince him to quit? Is it just a vacation thing? 
I really need help Reddit. respond if you can.

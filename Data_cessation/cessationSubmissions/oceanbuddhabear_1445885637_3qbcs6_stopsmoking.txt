I want to quit, but I just don't believe I can do it.

I really want to quit smoking, and now that I'm on a certain medication, I'm told that I have to quit. But now that its time, uncharacteristic of who I am, I just don't believe that I can do it.

Usually I would be enthusiastic about such a change in my life, but it just feels daunting. I've had the patches and sprays in my drawer for a while now. But I have never actually attempted anything yet, that's the part I keep avoiding.

Being without cigarettes actually kind of scares me. I've quit before when I was a teenager, but that was a long time ago. I think about the anticipation and anxiety I would feel without the cigarettes, the not being able to relax. I dont know if I could get passed that mindset of 'quitting' and actually 'quit'.

What do you think? Any words of advice? Has anyone else out there felt like me and quit?

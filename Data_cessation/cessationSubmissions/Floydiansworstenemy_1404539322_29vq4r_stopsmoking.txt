E-cigs: My first hope for redemption. This sub: my allies?

Its been 8 days. I'm not sure what my badge will say because I wasn't sure of the exact date and I didn't feel like using a calendar but it was last Thursday the last time I had tobacco. I bought a carton a couple weeks ago now and I promised myself I'd stop before I finished it. I have three wrapped packages left. I don't plan on opening them.

9 months, new perspective on life as a non-smoker

I did not expect this, 9 months later. The thought of smoking barely cross my mind, life becomes more simple you won't constantly worry about when you will smoke the next one. Life becomes more enjoyable even when you encounter hardship, you will no longer default to going out for a smoke. 

To whom are interest but haven't quit yet, I urge you to give it another try; for me I quit and caved in so many times but did not realize that 290 days ago that was it.

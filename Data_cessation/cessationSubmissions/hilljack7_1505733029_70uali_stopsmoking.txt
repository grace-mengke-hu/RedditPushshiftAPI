Day 1 - Advice

As of 6:30 am this morning I smoked my last cigarette. Countless times have I tried to quit, the most recent around a month ago. I keep giving myself excuses for buying a pack. I'm getting married in 2 weeks, my job (ISO Coordinator) stresses and money worries. You name it, that's been my excuse. I hate the way that cigarettes have been controlling me. Patches, Chantix and e-cigs have done nothing for me. The longest I went was 2 months with Chantix, but again, I found an excuse again to buy a pack. So, cold turkey here I come. I know that its not going to be easy. I know that after about day 4 or 5, things get exponentially better. Keeping it off is so hard. I WANT to quit. I NEED to quit. 

That's enough for my Monday morning rant. Just looking out there to see who can provide some advice or friendly support. I was going to check out the book that everyone has been suggestion to other quitters. Haven't pulled the trigger on it yet. I know I can do this! I hope that when you've read this, you have kept an open mind and said "Hey, I've been there, I need to give this guy some peace of mind". Cheers friends. Look forward to hearing from some of you!

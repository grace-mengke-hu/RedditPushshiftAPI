Tomorrow it will be my 1 year mark since I quit.

I haven't smoked a single cigarette since and I couldn't be happier. I breathe better, have lost weight, my skin looks healthier ans I've saved so much money.

I was a heavy smoker for 20 years and never thought I could be one of those people who gets to quit successfully.

But I did, took a lot of will power but I did it. I've even started running again!

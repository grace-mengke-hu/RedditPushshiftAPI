3 weeks

This might be the longest time I haven't smoked in the past 5 years. I still get few cravings a day but it's easier now because I know that if I will smoke a cigarette it will make me feel sh*tty both physically and mentally (I also suspect that cravings at this point are 100% mental although they might not feel that way and that smoking really won't cease them, I have noticed that if I quit for 2 weeks and smoke again then I get 0 satisfaction from it, it's actually disgusting so my craving doesn't even go away because I expect to feel something good from smoking, if anything it makes it stronger so I usually smoke like 3 in a row and am extremely disappointed).

First 2 weeks were very hard, after that it got way easier (although still somewhat hard). Really want to make it to 1 month. This is exciting!

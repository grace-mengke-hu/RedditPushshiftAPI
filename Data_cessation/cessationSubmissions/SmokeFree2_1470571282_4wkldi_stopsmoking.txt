Coughing and sore throat a month after quitting?

Hello Guys. I recently stopped smoking about a month ago almost two months. I had switched to vaping and every 2 times I ran out of juice I lowered my nic level. I smoked almost 2 1/2 packs a day that's a lot for a 19 year old and I regret it! But a month later I'm coughing like crazy and thick mucus only comes out when I cough and not when I spit normally. I checked my temperature Its pretty normal 97.6Â°F. Other symptoms I'm having are, Sore throat, runny nose, and other cold like symptoms. Has anyone encountered this?

Smoked almost 4 years
Switched to vaping in june
Also prescribed wellbutrin XL 300mg

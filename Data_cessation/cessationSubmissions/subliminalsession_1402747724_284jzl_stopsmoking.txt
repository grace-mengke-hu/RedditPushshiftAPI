are any quitters out there able to smoke weed sometimes without getting the urge to smoke cigarettes?

i am just curious. i smoked 14 a day, for five years, aged 21. i'm on day 7 of my cold turkey quit now, don't get me wrong i REALLY don't want to smoke cigarettes again i'm totally done buttttt i just wondered if there are any ex smokers out there who can occasionally smoke weed without getting the urge to smoke a cigarette etc? 

i used to smoke weed a lot and whilst i don't want to do that every day either, i do like a joint every now and again and would be a bit saddened to hear that i better stay away from weed forever, plus i live with a load of stoners, so it's going to be pretty difficult to abstain, know what i mean. 

i know there is herbal tobacco out there (apparently) that doesn't contain nicotine, and the option of just vaporising the weed or rolling a blunt but i just wondered whether even the action of smoking a joint would make the body and mind miss cigarettes

thanks and good luck to all the quitters :)

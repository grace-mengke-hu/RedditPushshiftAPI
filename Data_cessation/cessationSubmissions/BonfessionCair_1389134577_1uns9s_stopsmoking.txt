I just quit smoking. Third times the charm

Just stopped today. I've been smoking since the summer right after high school. It started after I started smoking weed and a friend convinced me that it made your high better. He was right, but damn it I waste so much money now. Oh yeah, and I'm fucking asthmatic, so it was a terrible idea to start anyways.

Around twenty minutes last sigaret. Should I quit?

I've been thinking about quitting a long time and I noticed this weekend that I smoke way more than I thought. I'm very short of breath. My nose is full up dried snot. My breath is devastating.  My gum is sore. My throat hurts. I stink, my hair, my clothes. Coughing. If I bent over to pick something up, I become reddish and short of breath. I got tingles in my arms and legs because of bad circulation. The problem is for some reason I like to smoke. Typing this gives me a craving to smoke. It's that strong. How do you guys and girls do it. Quitting. I know it's bad and it doesn't do anything. Yet I keep doing it. Should I buy a vaper? I know tobacco is already carcinogenic in its own, but at least I'm rid of the carbon monoxide and side products from the burning, so it's slightly less toxic. You can also pretend it's a real cigaret. U can't do it with patches or chewing gum. Or Just cold turkey. Cold turkey is imo the best, the only but the worst way to do it.

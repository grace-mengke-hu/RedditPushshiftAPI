Well the first day was tough, but I made it.

I'm 35 years old and started smoking a pack a day at 17.  That is HALF MY LIFE.  I don't even want to estimate how many cigs that is.

Well today I woke up and decided to give quitting another shot.

I have a full 3 step patch system + gum.  I've been holding a plastic straw as a cig all day.  A couple times I wanted to give up and run down to buy another pack.

I survived.  Going to take it one day at a time.  Good luck to all of you.

I want to quit smoking but can't stick to it

Hey everyone, M-26 here.

I've been smoking almost 5 years now and I tried to quit smoking around 8 times now.   
Everytime I have more than 2-3 weeks behind me I have the issue to stick to quit smoking.

I crave it mostly while driving in the car and at work. I tried apps, nicotine patches, cold turkey and couldn't stick through it.

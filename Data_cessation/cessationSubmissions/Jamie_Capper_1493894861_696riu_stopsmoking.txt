Here we go a-bloody-gain

Went just under three weeks smokefree, then I once again had a few nights out, thought i would smoke, fell into the trap head on which was followed by ten a day for a week. (20 yesterday - including the final 8 in an hour!) 

Just 14 hours in, half of that sleep, but we go again. First step getting past 18 days, which I have gotten to three times this year and failed to get beyond!

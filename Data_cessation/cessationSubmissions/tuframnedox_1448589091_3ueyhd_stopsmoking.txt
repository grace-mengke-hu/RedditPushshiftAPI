Even with NRT...

Smoker since fall of 2006 - half of those nine years have been spent with analogue cigarettes, add a couple years with e-cigarettes, and I've been nicotine free for two and a half in between. 

I've been on a bit more than half a pack a day since late 2013. Using 21mg patches. 48 hours later, I'm still struggling a few times a day. I haven't given in, but it's not easy. 

Am I doing something wrong? Should I have gone cold turkey? Should I stay the course with NRT?

Also: drinking is the next thing to go - I drink every night, four to eight shots of liquor. Smoking first (I've been smoking longer than I've been drinking). Obviously, alcohol is a trigger, but I don't think I can get rid of two things at once. 

Please tell me there's hope!

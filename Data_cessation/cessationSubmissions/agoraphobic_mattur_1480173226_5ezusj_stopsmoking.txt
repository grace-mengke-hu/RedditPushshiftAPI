5 days in Cold Turkey.

I'm 25, at a 8 year smoker. 2 pack a day for the past 4 years. 

My family gave me the ultimatum. After multiple smoky members died of cancer this pas month. 

I've quit a few times before. I think I'm going to make it this time because I actually want to quit. But some of the side effect are really hurting me. I'm getting hot flashes, bursts of what I'll refer to as rage, and I'm also becoming slightly paranoid about random things. 

Do any of you have any weird cravings or just intense weird side effects from the nicotine withdrawal? If so what were they?

412 days, and still some days I feel like having a smoke! :(

If anyone is reading this subreddit and even dare considering or contemplating smoking, please, for the love of god, please **DO NOT** start smoking. 

412 days in and some days I still feel (albeit a weakened) urge to have a smoke. Not going to lie but I live with smokers and while some cigarette brands smell disgusting, others smell so inviting, so good - it's almost as if I'm thirsty, haven't drank water in days and wanting it.. now.

 

Nicotine sure is one hell of a drug. Even after 412 days of not using cigarettes on some days it feels the same as day one. I don't think we ever get clean from nicotine, I think the nicotine's vicious claws just withdraw and leave permanent scars in its place, only to remind us every once and again what smoking was like. 

 

Does it **EVER** truly get easier?

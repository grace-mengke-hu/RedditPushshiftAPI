Crabby as Crabby Can Be

I was a non-smoker for over a year due to Allen Carr and the fact that I couldn't breathe anymore.  Prior, I smoked at least 1/2 a pack a day for 19 years.  My relapse started in January '13 and I smoked my last cigarette June 1st at 11:57PM.  

I'm not looking for advice or anything like that - I have my own process and the fact is I have zero desire to put one in my mouth and light up....If I really think about it.  I'm not moping about or depressed because I'm being deprived...But...I am crabby as hell.  Everything is irritating me.  I am not a shining sunflower of happiness and glee. 

I have not been in the mood to talk to anyone; have to muster up the energy to put on a friendly voice while on the phone and am dreading this coming weekend of parties, of the graduation kind and of the poker kind.  

I'm a girl and I know I am not PMSing.  So - why the crab??  I'm relieved to not be smoking.  

Anyone else feel like a super c*nt a few days into their quit?

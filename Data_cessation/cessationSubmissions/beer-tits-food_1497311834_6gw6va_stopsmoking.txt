As a man that rarely expresses emotions.

I am constantlyâ€‹ on edge.       
I am constantly bored.       
I am constantly sleepy.       
I am short of breath.       
No food sounds appealing.       
I hate my job that I've loved for years.       
       
After 25 years of smoking I quit cold turkey one week ago and I feel as though these emotions mean I have made the correct decision.

Unexpected cravings

First and foremost, I want to share and celebrate over 100 days with everyone here! I never thought I'd be a "veteran" on this sub. It feels good to be this far along, and maybe I can finally be an example to others who are starting out. 

But I also want to say that the past couple of days I've been craving cigs so bad. I honestly haven't had cravings like this since the first week of quitting. Something about the weather. It's freezing out and I'm nostalgic about those cold walks home from work with a cig in my hand. No idea why, most smokers I know complain about smoking outside in the cold. 
Talking to my coworkers, I pity them. They joke and grin about nicotine addiction forcing them to stand outside. So while I'm craving, I'll stand strong and not smoke. My smoker friends and coworkers sound pathetic when they talk about smoking a few puffs, then hiding their square on the steps before rushing back inside. Woof. 

Stay strong folks, addiction has a very nostalgic and social quality about it. It's very strong but you don't have to cave. It's all a trick of the mind.

1 week!

I came here without any planning after not smoking for 4 hours last week. I stuck to it. And here I am entirely free! I didn't participate much here, but thank you all nonetheless.

The main thing that helped me was to get it right in my head that I didn't have to smoke. That it doesn't make anything better. Any illusion you have that something is better with a cigarette is just wrong.

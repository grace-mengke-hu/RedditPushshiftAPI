Tomorrow I take control of my life.

Obligatory "On mobile sorry for format"


I have been thinking about quitting for some time now, and have been lurking here for the past week or so. I've tried to quit a few times before, but never with much success. I guess, if at first you don't succeed, try and try again. So here I am, tomorrow is my quit day. I don't want to substitute my smoking with something else like mints or gum or hard candies, but I also don't want to fail again.  I will be here updating daily, kind of like my own experience journal to try and help.  Also the support I have seen from this subreddit is awesome, and I need people like that to help me through the tough times. I have smoked a pack a day, usually a little more, for the past 7 years.  So I know it won't be easy, but if other people who have smoked longer than me can do it, then damnit I can too! I hope to be here, a year from today, being happy that I decided to break this unhealthy habit. So as I sit here, smoking what will be my last cigarette, I hope you all have a good night, and I shall see you tomorrow (with updates!)

Update1(5/12):  yesterday wasn't too bad. I didn't get many cravings, and when I did I just thought about something else.  That seemed to help until I woke up in the middle of the night, saw something that really pissed me off and I went to the gas station. I bought a pack and had a half of one, putting it out before I even got back home. Now I don't want to waste the ten dollars I spent by throwing them out, but I also don't want to smoke them all either.. I've only had 3 which is good but not great.  Im gonna keep trying to not smoke, and I'm resetting my badge :(

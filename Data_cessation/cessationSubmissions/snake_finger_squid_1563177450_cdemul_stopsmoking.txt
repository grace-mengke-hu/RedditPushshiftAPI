Ok, after lurking i’m posting so i have a way marker.

After one of my best friends unexpectedly quit last year, i decided it was time for me to quit (again) i managed over a year smoke free last time, don’t know why i ever started again.
I have even gone so far as to buy myself some running shoes, i know i will need to build up stamina, but doing that will hopefully give me focus to use to battle the cravings.


I did it once before, i can do it permanently this time. 


Im going to buy one of those disposable nicotine tampons, because it tastes like shit but also because i don’t want to just replace smoking with vaping, if i’m quitting then i’m quitting not substituting.


Any advice or positive reinforcement welcome!
Do we get flairs to help count the days?

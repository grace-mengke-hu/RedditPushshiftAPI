I've never wanted one more...

I made it all weekend with out a cigarette, went through a majority of my triggers with no problem...I spend an hour at my job and I've never wanted one more. I need to figure out a new way to deal with stress and with assholes. But proud of myself I've never wanted one more and I haven't gone downstairs to buy a pack/ask someone for one.

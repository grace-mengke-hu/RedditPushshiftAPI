Day 19 of freedom

Celebrating day 19 of having given up being a slave to my impulses, and I would be lying if I said I didn't feel any better or that I have regretted the decision to quit. 

It's true when people say that the first little while is incredibly difficult, you are not only battling chemical addiction/dependency, but you are also battling the comfort and habitual aspect of lighting up a smoke. Just sitting here writing this post I am having vivid thoughts of having a cigarette with my morning coffee, or on my drive home from work. The thing is is that I know I've gone too far to turn around now. I am a relatively 'on edge' person at times and quitting smoking has made me feel like my skin is fucking crawling at times. 

My advice to anyone either contemplating quitting, or in the early stages of smoking cessation, is to do what you did before smoking that made you happy. For me it was playing hockey when I was growing up. I haven't been in the longest time and I finally got back to it in the last couple of months and after combining a nice hard skate with the odd workout and a proper diet I feel like I am constantly on 3 red bulls lol. Not only that but I'm driven to get shit done. I am no longer looking for an excuse or a perfect little sliver of time to go have a smoke and run away from reality. 

Have integrity and don't guilt yourself if you have cravings, just have the inner strength to say to yourself "I don't need that shit" and do something positive and healthy and understand that you will reap what you sow and that the pros outweigh the cons times a thousand. 

Best of luck with the quitting smoking.

EDIT: PS: Any time you feel like relapsing, or any time you want to remind yourself just how excellent the decision to quit was, just remember this: You don't have to live with the constant paranoia that you are poisoning yourself or that you're going to get cancer/heart attacks/strokes/macular degeneration et cetera.

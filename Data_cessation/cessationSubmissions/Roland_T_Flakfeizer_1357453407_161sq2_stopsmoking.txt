I just smoked my last cigarette.

I've been a smoker since age 20.  I'm now 31.  I decided I definitely wanted to quit last year, and have since had a long string of failures.  Some quit periods only lasted a few hours, and the longest was 2 months.  This time will be different.  I bought my last two packs right before the new year with the promise that I would never buy another pack, and the last of those was just smoked ten minutes ago.  It's time.  In the last six months, I've begun a whole new life, and I want to live this one as a non-smoker.  I'm afraid that this one will end the same way all the rest of them did - one moment of weakness and suddenly I realize that I've bummed three from a coworker and have started walking towards the gas station for another pack.  But that was last year.  I'm a whole different person this year.  Time to act like it.  

Anyway, I only just discovered this subreddit recently, so now that I'm officially a non-smoker, I thought I'd introduce myself.  Thanks for reading.

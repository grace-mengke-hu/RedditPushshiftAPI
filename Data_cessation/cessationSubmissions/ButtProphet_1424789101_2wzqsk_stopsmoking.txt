Cold Turkey didn't work, slowing down to a few a day didn't work, just bought a vape kit

It's hard but not quite as bad. I also work with a ton of smokers who smoke literally right outside my window...but it's helping. I went from 1 1/2 packs a day to just 7 cigs two days ago and 4 cigs yesterday.

Just found this sub and wanted to post.

Have many of you quit using a vaporizer? Are you still vaping or did you completely quit?

I am done smoking. Getting rid of everything.

I've been "trying" to quit for years. Half-ass attempts, really. I don't enjoy smoking anymore and am ashamed to do it in public. In fact, I really only enjoy smoking if I'm drinking/drunk or drinking an energy drink. Since I don't want to deal w/caffeine withdrawals and quitting the sticks, I got some powdered green tea and have several large ball jars of that in my fridge for the morning. Hate cigarettes and cold green tea :)

I waste SO much time going outside for a cigarette and since I work from home, sometimes I'll work outside just to smoke, until someone comes by, then I'll go inside and wait for a bit. It's ridiculous. 

I live in a big drinking town with drinking friends, so I'm going to have to find some new activities as well, since my 1 year relationship is ending. After two drinks, the cravings really kick in, so not exactly sure how I'm going to handle dating, but I am done with this filthy habit.

Things I'm looking forward to:

Better skin
No more dark circles under my eyes
Not smelling like shit
No more small holes in my clothes
Clean smelling car
Clean teeth
Being a badass person who doesn't smoke

Today is my first day smoke-free for the rest of my life. 

I'll be checking in and reading the posts for motivation. Also using an app to track my progress and keep motivation high.

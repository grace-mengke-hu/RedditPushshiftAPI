3 Months!!

I have tried to quit and failed 1000's of times. I had all but given up trying to quit. I was resigned to being a smoker for the rest of my life. My son got me Allan Carr's book "The Easy Way To Stop Smoking" When I was finished with this book it was like I turned off a switch. I just didn't smoke any more. I am a non-smoker. I had no withdrawal (at least not that I noticed), no cravings, no insanity. I just stopped and am never looking back. Thanks to Mr. Carr and all you guys for your support.

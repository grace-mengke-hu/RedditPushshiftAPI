My bit of motivation for the day.

The CDC says that the number of former smokers exceeds the number of current smokers.

 Chances are, you WILL quit smoking sometime in your life.  The question is, WHEN? And "Why didn't I decide to do this sooner, BEFORE the chronic coughing, BEFORE the wrinkles set in, BEFORE my kids can copy my bad habit, BEFORE I get cancer, emphysema, COPD, and other smoking related illnesses. "

You WILL quit smoking sometime in your life.  Why not now?

It will be a a year this weekend while I face my greatest challenge yet.

Loading up a van full of friends and driving for my bachelor party back to my hometown area, where all the smoking started over 20 years ago. I occasionally have an herbal to kill the craving. Back there you can smoke in bars. Lots of triggers, but I'm ready.

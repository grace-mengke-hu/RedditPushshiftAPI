Help with tapering nicotine replacement therapy (lozenges)

Hi!

I've been browsing this subreddit since just before my quit date on September 1. So grateful for this resource!! 

I finally have my first question: how the hell do people come off of nicotine replacement therapy??? I've mostly used the lozenges (I can't get past the sensation that using the gum feels like chewing on a filling). Gradually, I've been INCREASING my use of the lozenges, which I know is a bad sign. It's become this compulsive behaviour, and it's escalating fast. Feeling shaky from the nicotine, and even though the physical benefits of quitting smoking have already been huge, I don't like that I'm still dependent on something. It's also super expensive, so I'm not really feeling the financial benefits of quitting.

I went from 2mg down to 1mg and didn't feel much of a difference, so I'm thinking that my impulse to use them is more behavioural than chemical. I've been thinking that it would help to transition to a nicotine-free substitute, at least part of the time, while I taper down.

So - does anyone know of a mint-type product that is similar to lozenges??? Any tips on coming off of NRT?

Thanks!

Getting your SO to follow your lead?

I quit smoking on 11/4/13, so I have been tobacco/cigarette free for 3 months 20 days. 


I used vaping to help me quit, but now I am approx 16 days no nicotine. I had never tried to quit before. I KNOW that I won't ever smoke again. I love cooking, and I feel like not smoking has helped with my smell and taste.


My SO is older than me, and has been smoking for over 20 years, quit once, but that obviously didn't stick.


I have been dropping hints to her that I really want her to quit. She stinks soooo bad, and we carpool a lot in my car. I already don't let her smoke in my car anymore.


She got a prescription for the patch about a month ago, and it has just been sitting there. 
Every time I mention quitting to her, she tells me that when I bring it up, it makes her not want to quit.


I don't think that is very fair. She has said on her own she wants to quit, but I just don't see her moving forward.


We are moving soon, and I told her that I don't want her smoking on the property at the new house, and she said she would walk down the street.  :\


Any suggestions on how I can bring it up without her getting defensive?

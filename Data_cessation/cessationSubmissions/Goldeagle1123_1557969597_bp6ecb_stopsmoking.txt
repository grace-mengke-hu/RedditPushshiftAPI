Stopped smoking 2 years ago, back on one cig a day due to girl problems.

My ex got me to quit smoking 2 years ago, I always genuinely wanted to but she gave me the motivation to do it. We broke up and now she's seeing another dude, so I turned back to cigs to cope and am back to one a day. Any help/advice is appreciated.

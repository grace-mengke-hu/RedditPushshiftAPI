I have a very boring life. Dose anyone have any tips on finding any alternatives to quit smoking?

I am a 20 year trying to get a job and waiting to sigh up for college. My problem is that I always have nothing to do during my day. I'm trying to look for other alternatives to smoking. Things like: video games, card games, straight edge music and playing a few of my instruments. If anyone else could offer a few more alternatives that would be helpful. Or if you see any disclaimers for my previous choices please let me know. Thank you.

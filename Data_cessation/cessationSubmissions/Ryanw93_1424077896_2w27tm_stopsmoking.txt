Has anyone successfully quit using nicotine aids?

I always thought they were counter productive to quitting because you don't detox your body or change your addiction. When I used them I found the cravings to be worse because I was still getting nicotine but I couldn't smoke. I was wondering if anyone had positive experiences with them?

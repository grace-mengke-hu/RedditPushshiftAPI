Can't stay quit and it's making me very depressed..

Hey guys, hope you're all doing great. I'm having real trouble staying quit this time around. I stopped for about 2 months by using Alan Carr's method. This was like a year ago and I stupidly started again after having that smoke that 'i knew I wouldn't like but I wanted to prove how over it I was

Now however, I just can't get passed 2 days without having a mad craving and just feeling like I'm not ready. Alan Carr's book doesn't really help me cause I've tried reading it so much I end up just subconsciously skimming it where the words are so familiar. 

It's making me really depressed cause I just do not want it anymore. When I do stop, I feel fantastic for the first 2 days then I just get to convinced I can't do it. I end up telling myself "you may aswell have one now cause you're only gonna have one later" e.g. I know I'll want one before work tomorrow so may aswell have one this evening...


Sorry for the wall of text but I'm getting desperate

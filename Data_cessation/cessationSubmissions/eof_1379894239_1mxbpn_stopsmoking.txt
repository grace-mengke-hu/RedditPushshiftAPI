this is r/stopsmoking, not r/stopnicotine

My badge is a lie.  Actually, as I came to post this, I thought I had removed it; but I will leave for the lulz.

I relapsed, months ago.  Then I started back up basically to where I was many times.  I've used and recommended the Easy Way.  

I encourage everyone to quit smoking.  I acknowledge that nicotine addiction is bad.

But, I think 'vaping' gets a worse rap in the sub than it ought to, and I want to share why.  To be clear, I am *not* suggesting that this sub turn into r/startvaping, but, I think ecigs are a really, really good thing for people who feel miserable but just aren't able to find the space to quit.

The thing about NRT in general is that while it quenches a thirst, it leaves lacking the oral fixation, the 'throat kick', the ritual, etc.

Ecigs are a shockingly-good substitute for smoking.  It's almost immediately just as satisfying (at least it was for me, and for the few I've talked to) and takes little-to-no effort to 'substitute' them for analogs.  They just 'fit right in there'.

It is *much* cheaper to smoke ecigs in most jurisdictions this sub reaches(prob not true in places where cigs are still ~$1/pack); and the less-bad effect on the lungs is obvious.  I still feel my lungs; yet, going from analogs to ecigs put my body through a detoxifying effect.. the surge in productive coughing, etc.  

I say quit nicotine over taking up ecigs; but ecigs over analogs *any day of the week*.

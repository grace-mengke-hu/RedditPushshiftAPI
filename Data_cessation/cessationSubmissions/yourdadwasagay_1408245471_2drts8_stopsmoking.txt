Fuck fucking fuckery fuck's sake mother of fuck. (Or: yourdadwasagay waxes poetic on end of day 2 anxiety)

God fucking damnit. This is my third serious attempt in the last week. Last one I smoked was 4 a.m. Friday morning (yesterday). Sometimes I manage to altogether forget about the constant headache, the weird fatigue, the irritability, or, the most notable and nagging symptom, the inside of my entire chest feeling at once under intense pressure and also like it's on fire.

Sometimes I forget that. The rest of the time I want to smash elbows into faces. I may not have moral qualms about bomb dropping a puppy. I'm at my sister's house. She asked what the time was a bit ago and I almost said NINE THE FUCK THIRTY ABOUT TEN MOTHERFUCKING MINUTES SINCE YOU LAST ASKED ME but I just said Nine thirty.

I'm a self-perpetuating anger and irritation machine. But I'm still not gonna smoke. Just ranting here.

I'm at two weeks and can't even believe it...

I feel almost surprised i've made it this far. Two weeks ago I made the decision to read Allen Carr's book in one evening. 

I feel like the book really helped--although I somewhat planned my quit date so that I'd be more likely to succeed. I quit on a Friday so that my first two difficult days were over the weekend, when I was NOT at work. I sit at a desk all day in a stressful medical records department at a psych hospital, so I knew I'd be more likely to cave and run to the store there.

Over the weekend, my boyfriend and I stayed busy and I was able to up and find something to do when I had an intense craving. 

By Monday, I was so proud that I had two days that I felt it was slightly easier to get through the work day without a smoke. It was difficult no doubt, but much easier than had I quit Monday.

Each day gets easier. I try to put my self in trigger situations so my brain gets used to me not smoking. I keep my kindle with me so I can read some highlighted parts in Allen Carr's book as well, and that has been a tremendous help. I need to constantly remind myself how stoked I am not to smoke.

The biggest difference I've noticed is when I'm running. IT IS SO MUCH EASIER WHEN YOU CAN BREATHE!!!

So, just wanted to share my story and what has helped me!
Keep up the good work, r/stopsmoking!

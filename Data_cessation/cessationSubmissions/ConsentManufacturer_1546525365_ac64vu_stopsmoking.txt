Chest discomfort

I was smoking 6 or so cigs 3-4 nights a week for quite a while with drinking. I quit smoking in the day or without liquor ten tears ago.

Since switching to an occasional vape, I can already feel expanded lung capacity just since Thanksgiving, but some days they feel tired or sore. Is this normal? Other people feel some discomfort after the lungs "wake up" after quitting?

Why are week milestones so tough to go through? I am on day 25 and I am really afraid of the 1 month milestone.

Why is the day we turn 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks and 1 month smoke-free so tough? I don't really understand how during the week everything is so "easy" but then on the day of a milestone it is so tough. Why does this happen? I'm kind of afraid of this Saturday as I will be 1 month smoke-free by then. I know I won't go back to smoking, but I expect it to be tough. 

Why does this happen?

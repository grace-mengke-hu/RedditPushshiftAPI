Day 6... Wanting to give up.

I quit last Sunday. It's been a tough week with midterms at my university and fighting a lot with my significant other. I did fine for the first 5 days, maybe because I was busy and could exercise? Now I'm snowed in, didn't get enough sleep, and frankly, all I want is a damn cigarette. Most of me thinks that I would be devastated to have to reset my progress and it's not worth it. But then there's that part of me that won't stop nagging for a cigarette. Anyone have some advice?

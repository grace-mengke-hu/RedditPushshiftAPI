I'm happy to finally be free

I just smoked my last cigarette. I wanted the 14th to be my quit date because 14 is my favorite number, cheesy, but that's what I did.
I no longer want nicotine in my body, it's an enslavement that I want to be free of and I will be. I figured I'm going to quit one day anyway to it might as well be now after 3 years of doing half a pack a day.
Stay positive quitters!!

Nearly relapsed on day 11.

Have been to a very good restaurant with my sister. Then ate some chocolate and peanuts late in the night and drank some booze.
Then I woke up at 4 a.m., unable to breathe due to some gastric acid in my larynx.
It was pure horror.
After things got right again and during the whole morning i had such an urge to smoke, because this event really scared me. But finally I kept strong and did not smoke! ☺️

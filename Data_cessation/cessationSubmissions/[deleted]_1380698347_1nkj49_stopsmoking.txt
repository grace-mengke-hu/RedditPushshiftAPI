Day 1, and I did not even know I was quitting today!

I woke up sick of it. Sick of my clothes and house smelling. Sick of coughing! Sick of buying the stupid things! So I did not buy another pack when I discovered I was out...

I live with two other adults who smoke, I need help remembering how much I hate this addiction so that I don't crack the second I get home!

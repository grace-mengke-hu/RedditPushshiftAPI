Day 1 for Hubby and Me after FIL diagnosed with Lung Cancer

Last weekend my husband's father confessed that he had been diagnosed with Lung Cancer. Stage 4, terminal-- nothing they can do to help him get better-- they can only slow it down. My husband has been smoking since he was 16 and we have been together for almost 10 years. We have been on again and off again smokers for many years.
 
With this terrible realization I feel  its finally time that we should end this era of our lives once and for all. It's already been hard this very first day with my husband being incredibly cruel and bitter-- and at counseling today we talked about what we can do to take care of each other.

I want him to live a long time and be healthy and with what will happen with his father.... it feels like the right time. I hope we do okay-- thank you for being such a supportive community.

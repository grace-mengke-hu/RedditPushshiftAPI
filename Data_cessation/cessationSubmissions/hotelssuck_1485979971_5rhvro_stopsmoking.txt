Fell off the wagon

What can I saw. It's been years since I quit. Work has me stressed. Family life has me stressed... I smoked and instantly felt a ton better, which is what has me worried. I want to be here for my wife and future kids. What's the best way to nip it in the butt and find other ways when I get this freaked out? I've never posted here before but I needed to tell someone who wouldn't instantly be disappointed in me.

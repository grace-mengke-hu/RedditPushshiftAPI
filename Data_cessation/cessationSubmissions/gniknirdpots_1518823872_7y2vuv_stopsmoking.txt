7 1/2 Months No Smoking or Chewing Tobacco

I've quit cigarettes before for approximately a year. That time was interesting. I was smoking a cigarette and I had the thought that cigarettes don't even give me a buzz anymore, they make me stink, they smell like shit and they make me feel like shit when I smoke them.

So I put out the half smoked cigarette and I was so disgusted with cigarettes I didn't smoke for a year and never even had a craving. I was done.

Why'd I relapse? Well it was actually really dumb. I didn't crave a cigarette, I just randomly thought that I should grab a pack of cigarettes. I just kinda accidentally relapsed.

So that was last time. This time it has been 7 1/2 months smoking and chewing tobacco free. 

My chew addiction was way worse in the end compared to smoking. Chew was cheaper and I could do it inside the house or car all day long. Chewing substituted for smoking.

This time around I started using medical marijuana which caused me to lose all desire for all of my addictions. 

I also quit alcohol 7 1/2 months ago. Alcohol is the real demon on my back.

I feel so irritable!

Last Sunday I randomly decided to not smoke. That was basically because I was so hungover from going out that I didn't had the energy to get up and go outside. Eventually I noticed I hadn't smoked at all and was curious to see how far I could go. Downloaded the Smoke Free app and didn't mention it to anyone else. If I would fail, I would only disappoint myself.    
And that's what I'm holding on to, not disappointing myself. I know I will regret it if I take that one puff. It's just... I don't feel like myself. It's day 4, things during work go just fine. But once I'm at home, gah, it feels like constant fighting and it wears me out. I try to distract myself with some exercise, or focusing on hobbies. Chewing nicotine free gum, 'cause I'm going cold turkey, eating snacks like cucumber, because I don't feel like gaining a lot of weight either. It's little things that make me super cranky too, like I need to do groceries and it's raining and it outright pisses me off.  
I really do want to quit, but I don't want to feel like this for a long time. Any advices?

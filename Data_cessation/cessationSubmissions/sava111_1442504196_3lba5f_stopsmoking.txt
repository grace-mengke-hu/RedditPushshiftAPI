Today I quit and I'm never turning back.

I'm sick of paying to kill myself! I've been a pack a day smoker for 15 years. I woke up yesterday and nearly threw up on the way to the store due to the gunk in my lungs. I didn't buy a pack. I knew Reddit would be able to help so I searched stop smoking and I found a thread that suggested the 'Easy Way to Quit Smoking' by Allen Carr. Read the entire book yesterday and came to the conclusion that the best way for me to quit was cold turkey. No matter what feelings of depression envelops me I refuse to ever smoke another cigarette. Bottom line I'm just not doing it and eventually it will pass. Thank you Reddit I knew you guys would be able to help.

When you first stop smoking is it better to surround yourself with friends or be more introverted?

I'm thinking about stopping after the cig I just had. None of my friends smoke. Should I lay low for a while or hang out with people? Some girl asked me if I wanted to study tomorrow but I don't want to be an asshole to her (sort of like her).

Tryin to quit so i need to talk about it.

The main reason I keep smoking ( I got 2 cigs left) is that I can't stand the fact that I will never smoke again. I am 22, about 15 g a day tobacco smoker. Statistically, ex smokers begin to be happier than smokers about 1 year in. But the thing is, I can't wait 1 fucking year. What I realized is that smoke creates a veil. It makes your problems seem less important. It makes you keep doing the things that you wouldn't do without a smoke. I keep thinking about cancer everyday and that makes things worse. I guess it's time for a change.. However, everytime I try to quit, I see the mess of my life. I am trying to take it 1 day at the time, but I can't even stand the minutes.. I got 1 smoke left now, and i will smoke the last one during your replies. I never asked for any cheers up in my life, but I guess that now I really need it. So please reply and wish me everything you want. Just make me feel like I am not alone in this attempt to get my life back

Today was hard.

17 days in and today was extremely difficult. I thought about smoking multiple times. The mental process was there but I will not bring myself to physically act on it. I think I want a cigarette but I know if I try to smoke one at this point it is going to taste awful and I'll hate myself afterwards. 
So instead of smoking I'll just come in here and tell you people about it. It takes the power out of the sometimes cravings. Whatever works.

29 days, my longest ever.

I don't exactly fit in here seeing as I used to dip rather than smoke, but there doesn't seem to be a more fitting subreddit. Hopefully that's alright.  I started chewing just under four years ago and I know I've done some damage to my poor mouth and gums. My best friend and I quit together almost a month ago and I've been doing just fine until today.  

Last night I had a dream that I was having a dip while playing some video games, and then while hiking (my two favorite activities to enjoy a dip to). Now I'm experiencing some really strong cravings.  It's all mental, which I know I can beat, but I figured hearing some other's stories of success would help. How are you guys doing?

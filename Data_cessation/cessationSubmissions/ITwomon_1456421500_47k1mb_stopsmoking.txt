Cravings are lying to me now

I think, "I can just run out and buy a pack. I'll smoke today and be back on track tomorrow/ or later." I'm tired of this. I'm an addict and I know it. I cannot have just one, smoke for a day, smoke for a weekend. If I have one, I'll have a pack a day and will fall right back into smoking full time. I'm 38 and have smoked a pack a day for the majority of 24 years. I'm using NRT patches and still have strong cravings. I am on day 4 smoke free. I am hoping for the strength to get through this.

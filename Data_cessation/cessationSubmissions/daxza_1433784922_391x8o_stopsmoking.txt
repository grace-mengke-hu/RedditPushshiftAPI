Quitting after nearly a decade.

I have been smoking for a few months shy of a decade.
I have tried to quit many times in the past.  Cold turkey, cut-back plans, the buddy system, medication.  I could go on about the medication instead I will simply suggest that you avoid it.

I had what I consider to be my last cigarette last night.  Enough is enough.  I thought posting here would help me commit.  

Cheers.

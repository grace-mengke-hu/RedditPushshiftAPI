Things that have worked for this month being smoke free

Tomorrow I will be smoke free for 1 month. Yay! It has been both easier and harder than I anticipated. Because I found some things that worked, I wanted to share them with you so that someone out there could benefit from my trial and error.

(1) Breathing deeply has helped. Each time I was ready to cave, I breathed in for 4 sec, held for 7 sec, and breathed out slowly for as long as I could muster. It took me away further from the craving if I did this while taking a walk.

(2) Taking a 20 minute walk once or twice (when lucky) a day. During this time, I got to breathe, relax, and listen to music. I could, again, disengage form the stress or the stressors of quitting.

(3) I had, this past month and am having right now, some unforeseen stressors happening in my life. There are about three stressors I had not banked on happening (LIFE!!!). How I have dealt with them is to reframe/rephrase my cravings into something positive - which sounds really, really cheesy when said aloud. I think (or say to myself): Well, who knew you could make it through this without a cigarette?! You never thought you could get rid of smoking so maybe the ending to all of these situations won't be as bad as you thought?!"

And, that is all I have. This is the longest I have gone without cigarettes in 30 years. And, I am grateful to be able to tell someone...Oh, I am doing this covertly and no one has noticed. (Why?! So much stress all around and in my role as caretaker I don't want the focus to be on me.) 

I wish everyone better and more luck than I have had, despite my feeling very lucky today!

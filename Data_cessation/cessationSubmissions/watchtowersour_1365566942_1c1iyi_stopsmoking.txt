If you're having cig problems I feel bad for you son..

.. 99 problems and a stick ain't one! Feels so good. One day at a time, for anyone struggling right now, it gets easier, maybe not right now but it will in a few minutes. Give it time fellow redditors, it gets much better with time. 

I still get the urges once in a while, but they're merely a faint glimmer of what they were like those first two weeks after I quit. I'll sometimes get a pang of jealousy, a subtle envy when I see someone smoking, seemingly relaxing and enjoying life, giving into their urges like it ain't no thang. Then I realize, that life sucks and is not even remotely close to what it's cracked up to be at times. 

Stay strong, let me know if I can help in any way.

tomorrow is my quit date (question)

I have quit before many years ago. 

Some of the issues I faced were:

1. My morning routine was discombobulated for a while! Any suggestions that can help with that? How long until the new non-smoker routine feels more normal?

2. My lungs HURT LIKE HELL for a few weeks. I do know this is part of the "lung cleanup and repair" process. I don't know for how long and any advice to assist this. 

3. Any other insight would be appreciated. 

Catch y'all on the flip-side!!

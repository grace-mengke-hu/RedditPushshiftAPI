I just smoked my last cigarette.

I just smoked my last cigarette. I can do this. I had 2.5 cigs left and the flavor was disgusting. I am going through a stressful breakup and have smoked so many cigarettes the past four days. I cant stand this addiction and I want to be free from it. I hate them so much and want to be healthy again. I have a long road to climb but I can do it! I installed my quitbuddy and I am determined! Here we go!

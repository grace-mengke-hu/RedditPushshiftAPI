Milestone time!

So how have these 100 days been and what have I learned?

Well, I have tried stopping before which I failed at, (obviously), so this time going through I absolutely abstaining from even considering ever taking a single breath of air through a cigarette filter. 

I have had quite a few triggers and as summer is moving towards us, I think I will have a lot more, but I've worked through them, and everytime I face another I know that I just have to stay strong.

So what advice do I have? 

*  Go cold-turkey, all those patches, e-cigs and so forth are just ways to push the problem further in to the future. 

* Keep doing your business as always (well, wait until after the first 7-10 days to go outside with the smokers on your break maybe), expect the triggers and be aware.

* Drinking alcohol might lead to a slip up, so the first times, don't drink very much so you can start teaching yourself that you don't have to have a cigarette to party.

Hm, and thats what I have, I guess. I wrote this as much for myself as I did for you. But I hope some of you could use any of this.

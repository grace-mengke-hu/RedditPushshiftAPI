I can quit smoking in one country but have no self-control in another one

I am in the process of moving to a new country so I’ve still been spending a good amount in both. When I am in the new country (Canada), I don’t smoke. It’s not that hard, I don’t get cravings and I feel great about not smoking. I don’t feel like I’m missing out. 

In the old country, there is way too many triggers and memories. I can’t get in my car and not light up. Everyone around me there smokes so that makes it harder. 

The second I arrive in the new country, all the cravings are gone and I’m at peace again. 

Anyone else experience this?

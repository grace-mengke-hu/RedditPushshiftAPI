Chantix users

Does anyone else who uses chantix feel like it makes them crave a cigarette worse? Like that crazy craving that has made u drive to the store and buy a pack and fail like so many times before? I take chantix and forty five minutes after I take it I'm dying for a cigarette. I have been smoke free for five days now and I'm doing well, but I stopped the chantix and quitting seems easier. My Dr said I shouldn't stop it because I might relapse...has this happened to anyone else? Should I keep taking the chantix?

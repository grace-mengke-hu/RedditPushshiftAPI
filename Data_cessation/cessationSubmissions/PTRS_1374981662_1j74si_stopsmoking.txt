Major victory while drunk

Drinking has always been a major trigger for me. I could easily go through a pack during 1 night (in Shanghai you can still smoke in bars). 

After reading Allen Carr's book more than a month ago, I was convinced I'd never smoke again. 3 days later, while drinking, I caved, bought a pack and smoked half of it. The hangover, coupled with the sore throat the next day was not fun. 

Alright, fuck it, reset badge, and keep on trucking with the newfound knowledge that I would have to be extra careful in controlling my urges when I'm drunk. 

I remember the subsequent night drinking, how much I craved a cig, and how proud I was of myself when I got home and didn't smoke any. Every subsequent drinking session it became easier to resist the urge. And last night ^(it's Sunday, 11:15AM here, greetings from the future!) I had a major break through. 

Blackout drunk. Friend who is only an occasional smoker (and who used to bum cigs off me all the time) goes out to buy a pack. Pack is on the table. Friend is next to me smoking. And as I was looking at the pack, I realized: I don't crave a cigarette.

Chest Pain

I have been half a pack/day smoker for the last 6 years and Its been about 100+ hours since I quit, big thanks to this sub and the motivating things you guys seem to share to help each other, helps me a lot in dire times (read cravings)" :)

Anyway I quit this shit and I am so happy. I am able to enjoy football once again as I don't feel I am going to die all the time.

But, I do have some nagging chest pain (esp on the right part) and it has been bothering me for a while. 

You guys experienced something like this earlier? know anything about it? What should I do? Sort of mildly scared.

50 Days and Some Snot

50 days in since my last cigarette, as of about 10 minutes ago. For some reason, I've been sneezing my brains out since about 10pm last night, and had a chronically runny nose. I'm not sure if it's allergies, a cold, or increased sensitivity because I've been holed up inside of AC all summer, but along with _The Thing that Shouldn't Be_ trying to crawl out of my face, I've noticed that I've got the taste in my mouth and sinuses of smoke and tar, now, as if I'd been smoking.

My best guess is that all the extra snot is getting pumped up out of my lungs with the accumulated gunk of 22 years of smoking. Anyone else experienced this, or am I some kind of horrible freak?

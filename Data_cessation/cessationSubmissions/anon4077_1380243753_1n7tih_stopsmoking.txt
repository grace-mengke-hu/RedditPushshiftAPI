Quit for 9 months easy with the right motivation...

I stopped smoking cold turkey when I found out I was pregnant back in January.  I did not have any slips or trouble quitting at all. My son was born on August 24th and here it is a month later and I am thinking about smoking a lot.  I keep trying to rationalize it by saying I just want to smoke one but I know that is not how it is going to work out. Not looking for much here, just hoping typing it out might make resisting easier.

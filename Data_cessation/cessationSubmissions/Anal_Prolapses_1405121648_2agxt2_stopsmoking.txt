Generic "How do I quit smoking cigs if I love smoking cigs" plea.

So I need to quit smoking cigs. I have to. I've only been smoking regularly (half a pack to a pack a day) for 4 years now, but I can't seem to quit, and I've come to some financial hardships where I can't afford 6 dollars every 2 days. So I gotta do it. But...how? Smoking has been so great to me. There are so many great things it offers me. I've met literally all of my good friends just smoking a cig outside of college or public places. It destresses me, gives me something to do, I can get out of social situations whenever I want. And I work in the restaurant bis where the only break I'm going to get is a couple of smoke breaks, and it's nice sitting around with people and shooting the shit for a little while. Without smoking I wouldn't have that. But I need to quit. I know I do. It'd be nice knowing I'm an otherwise healthy young adult who is saving money and not fucking smoking. Send help.

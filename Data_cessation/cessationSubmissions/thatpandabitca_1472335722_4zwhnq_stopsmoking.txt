Im trying to quit...

And I've already cut down. I'm vaping in-between smoking and it's hard. I have two very supportive people who won't quit on me, no matter how bitchy I get. A few of my friends still smoke and my two roommates smoke. I just wanted to tell someone that I'm quitting because if I tell Facebook it'll just be endless "tips" and more pressure.

I had a bottle of wine last night...

And didn't smoke! 

I stopped smoking 2 months ago but, on the weekends, when I'd have some wine, my head stopped telling me how bad smoking was & how one or two cigarettes a week wasn't bad compared to what I was smoking before. My non-smoking brain was switched off because of the alcohol. Then the guilt of the next day would come. I managed to keep off smoking at all other times, just not with alcohol. 

Yesterday, I did it. I had to do some baking to keep my mind off it but I did it! Now for more weekend successes then I will feel ready to come off Zyban & quit for real.

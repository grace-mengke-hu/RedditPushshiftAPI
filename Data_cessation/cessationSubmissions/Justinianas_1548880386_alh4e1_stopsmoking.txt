Picture of Van Gogh's painting, which shows how strong addiction the smoking is and it doesn't end even after death. I renamed it "Half future Me", because i know that one day i will be dead, but not with a cigarrete in my mouth. Also it costed me a warning from museum worker for taking picture. ðŸ˜‚

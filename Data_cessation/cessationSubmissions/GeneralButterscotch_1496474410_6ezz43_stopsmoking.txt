I want to smoke only once (for a friend)

I'll be honest: I'm not a smoker. I've never touched it, and god forbid that I ever do. 
Unfortunately, first times are something I like to keep track of with my best friend, and when she dies, I want to symbolically  commemorate her with a smoke. JUST. ONE.
I don't want to pick up the habit; no one I know is making me, but she deserves a first which is as serious as smoking.
I was hoping that you guys, as experienced well-meaning smokers and former smokers, could help me figure out how to only have ONE even if it isn't a sure-fire method.
Thank you very much.

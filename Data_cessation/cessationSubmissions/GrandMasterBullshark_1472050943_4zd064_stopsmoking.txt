Is there anything I can smoke that has no adverse side effects?

Hello, I'm working my way towards quitting. Still haven't fully quit yet but I'm down  considerably. I hate smoking but I feel the ritual is whats keeping me back. Has anyone found any sort of herb or substance that I can smoke, that will give me that harshness in the back of my throat which I so crave? Now I know the obvious answer is weed, but I try not to smoke it the day before work. Vaping is something I've been avoiding as it is ultimately what got me back on the way on after 18 Mos smoke free, also there is quite the stigma and a large undertaking when you get into that world. Is there anything out there or am I just gunna have to suck it up (no pun intended)?

18 years old, cant stop smoking

Hey, i turned 18 a few days ago. (Sorry my english, im from Argentina). I've been smoking for a year now, (marlboro, lucky strike). I smoke like 10 cigarretes a day. Im worried about my healt, but i cant stop smoking. It makes me feel good about my anxiety. Im going to a psychologist and psychiatric, i have ocd and irrational fears, panic attacks and more. My fear is to have cancer or something like that. Cold turkey doesnt work for me. 
I dont know what to do :(

How I broke my nicotine addiction

**Background:**
I started smoking casually at age 16, and didn't consider myself "addicted" until I was about 21. As of this summer I was up to 1 pack every 1.5 days. (I am now 26)

**Transition from regular cigs to e-cigs:**
I started playing with the disposible Blu e-cigs around the beginning of the year, and eventually got the cartridge packs, but found that I was just supplementing my cigarettes with Blu cigs when indoors. Because of this, I started to fall off with Blu and just went back to regular cigs.
In September I purchased by first real e-cig: a knockoff Kanger Evod. It was working out great; the only times I would buy regular cigs was when I was drinking a lot with other people that smoked. I wasn't all the way there yet, but I was buying regulars significantly less.
In October I upgraded my e-cig to a iTaste MVP with Kanger Protank II, and stopped buying regulars altogether. I went a few weeks, and had a friend let me take a drag of their cig. The smell of a burning cigarette still intrigues me, but the taste was terrible. I let a few more weeks pass, and this past Friday, I took another drag from another friend. Inhaled/exhaled, looked at my friend and told them, I do not want this anymore. I was smoking a lot of sweet flavors such as Double-Dark Chocolate, Starburst, and Dreamsicle. I'm not much of a candy eater, but I think the contrast between the sweet vapors, and the harsh tobacco helped a lot with breaking my addiction to regular cigs.

**Weening of nicotine level:**
When I first started with the knockoff Kanger Evod, I was smoking "medium" nicotine (18mg). When I upgraded to the MVP/Protank I transitioned to the "low" nicotine (11mg), and didn't notice any difference. I had at this point committed to the idea that I would eventually get the 0mg nicotine, but I do not want to "quit" the process of smoking. I enjoy the inhale and exhale; the cloud of smoke, and doing tricks with the smoke. I have ADHD and mild anxiety, and the process of smoking is still very therapeutic to me. This past Sunday I purchased my first blend of 0mg nicotine juice, and have not looked back. I have not noticed any cravings, nor any increase in the amount of juice that I'm smoking. It's all going so much better than I could have ever dreamed for. I've convinced a number of my friends, as well as total strangers to give e-cigs a try. If you've got any questions or comments, I'd be glad to help you out.

Today's my last day

Let us hope!  I've tried and failed before, even made a post here before about trying to slow down in an attempt to quit, but nothing has taken so far.  This time I'm not really doing anything different, but it's getting to the point where I feel I need to quit before it becomes a lifelong habit.  I know other people smoke more than me, and have been smoking for longer so I have sort of kidded myself out of quiting before saying shit like "well he's been smoking a pack a day for 40 years and I've only been smoking half a pack for 7 years, so it's not that bad"... 

And yeah I picked today for a reason.  I know how people feel about pot on this sub, I don't have much of a defense other than I don't associate the two, but I have also read that it can be hard to smoke one without the other, so I will definitely see how it turns out.

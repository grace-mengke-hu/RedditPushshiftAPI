Relapse

Almost three weeks smoke free. Down the drain. I hate myself right now. I've been really struggling here the last week or so. My depression is kicking my ass and my anxiety has been insane. And I just flushed it down the drain... I went and bought a pack. As I was buying it I was trying not to cry because I was so disappointed in myself for doing it. And I cried as I smoked my first cigarette. But I just. I can't even justify it. I'm so disappointed in myself. I don't even know if I'm going to be able to quit again now...

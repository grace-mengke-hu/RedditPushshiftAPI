Quit 10 days ago. Made it through NYE and Christmas, but first day back at work is surprisingly the hardest.

I thought the holidays would be hard and turned out to be easier than I thought. But now I'm sitting at my desk for the first time not knowing how to take a break.   Good news is I'll be way more productive  bad news is I have no outlets and tons of cravings.   Any advice out there or at least commiseration?

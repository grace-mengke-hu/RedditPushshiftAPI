Any Suggestions?

So you're the only people who will understand this next statement.  I've quit smoking about a hundred times it feels like.  The longest I went was 6 months but it always seems to creep back up.  This morning I woke up and decided, yet again, that I want to quit.  Any suggestions on making it stick?

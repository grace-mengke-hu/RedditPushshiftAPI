Hello!

Hi, my name is sarah-goldfarb and I'm a nicotine addict ("Hi, Sarah.") It's actually been more than a day-- about 40 hours-- since my last cigarette. I just wanted to introduce myself. 

I'm 24 and I've been smoking a pack/day since I was 18. I've tried to quit before (patches, cold turkey) but this time I'm absolutely, 100% resolute that I will never smoke another cigarette again as long as I live. Smoking has really fucked up my life in a lot of ways, which I will now list:

* I have an awful chronic cough, which is distracting and is sometimes the first thing that people notice about me
* My chest and lungs hurt constantly, and are often so sore that sleeping is difficult 
* Breathing has recently become difficult, and I'm concerned that I might actually have developed a lung disease already (I'm too scared to go to the doctor and check)
* I'm developing wrinkles and skin discoloration 
* I've spent thousands of dollars on cigarettes 
* I'm single, and it's harder to date as a smoker
* My house, car, purses, and patio are all constantly littered with empty cigarette packs, ashes, and butts
* My voice is obnoxious because I'm constantly choking back the post-nasal drip 
* My smoking habit enables my mother's smoking, and she (as a 56 year-old) will be in serious jeopardy if she continues to smoke
* If I maintain my lifestyle, I will probably have a heart attack at 30. 

Sigh. Just writing that out was very helpful. This is the first time that I've ever known *for sure* that I'm done smoking, and nothing is going to stop me from quitting. I'm still ridiculously crabby, though, and my head hurts. Please give me advice: how do you deal with the mucus coming up from your lungs? That's my biggest smoking trigger, it's driving me nuts. And how do you deal with being *so annoyed* by all of the people around you? I'm usually a totally zen, social human, but I swear to god I just want to smack EVERYONE IN THE FACE. I HATE THEM. 

I'm sorry this is so stream-of-consciousness. My brain is only functioning at 25% because of the withdrawl. Your support and advice are appreciated in advance.

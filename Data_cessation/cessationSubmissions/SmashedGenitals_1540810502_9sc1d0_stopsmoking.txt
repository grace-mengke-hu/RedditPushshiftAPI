48 hours in, is having a high sensation normal?

I've stopped vaping cold turkey for the 48th hour now and I'm constantly feeling kinda... Dizzy and high, kinda here nor there feeling. Is this normal or is it an indication of something serious?

I was just cutting my toenail earlier and I must've not paid attention and cut deeper than I thought, I wasn't paying attention until my feet is wet and I am bleeding (not sure major though!)

Also, I keep making typos at work for some reason.

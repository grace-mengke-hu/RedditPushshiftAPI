What made Allen Carr's book such a success for you?

I just started listening to Allen Carr's "Easy Way to Stop Smoking" and am digging it so far. I like how instead of focusing on the negative aspects of smoking (which we all know), he encourages you to shift your focus to the positive aspects of it (i.e. NONE). It's already helping me to realize that I gain nothing from smoking, but am losing so much. The equation doesn't make sense.

Anyway, I just wanted to see if that was the takeaway for everyone else, or if there's other bits of wisdom that resonated with you more.

Starting Day 6

Still here, still not smoking. Last couple days have been super hard, harder than the first 2-3 but I remain resolved to no more smoking. Trying to find my triggers and associate new things with them... some times it works, some times it does nothing. But I will carry on with this smoke free life.

How goes it for all of you?

12th day

This week has been so much better than last week but today is especially hard. The cravings aren't really bad anymore but this anxiety/depression is almost harder to deal with than the withdrawals!  However It's so nice to breathe better and not smell bad. I actually have energy to exercise which is awesome. I'm hoping this just gets better with everyday smoke free.

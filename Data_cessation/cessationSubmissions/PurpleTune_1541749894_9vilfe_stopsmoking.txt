The day has finally come! I need your advice, fellow redditors.

So, I said a month ago that I would quit today. I don't have to work for the next 3 days, so I thought it would be easier for me. Last night before I went to sleep, I threw my last cigarettes out. Now, I'm drinking my morning coffee, without smoking... And it's driving me crazy. Any advice on what to do on the following days?

Identifying where you’ve caved in the past

How have you managed to get through cravings now based on past “failures”? I’m noticing I cave because a grand voice in my head says, “fuck it. Not today”. 

I’m going to replace the thought, “fuck it, I’m having a smoke” to “forget it, I’m not having a smoke.”

Thoughts?

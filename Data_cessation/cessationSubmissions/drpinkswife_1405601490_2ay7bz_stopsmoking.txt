I did it!

Lovely leisurely brunch alfresco. After about two hours, walking back home, we had to walk through the town centre. I noticed someone light a cigarette. I realised I hadn't though of smoking the whole time. 

It's so refreshing to be at a restaurant and NOT be wondering a) can I smoke, b) where can I get an ashtray, c) am I bothering everyone around me? Of course I am, but how can I have this cigarette without it bothering people, I CAN'T! Now I REALLY need to smoke to relieve the stress of dining out! I didn't go through any of this. It was brilliant.

We went a little up-market for brunch and no one was smoking and we were sitting outside by the river Ver and it was so perfect.

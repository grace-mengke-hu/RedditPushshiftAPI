So far, so good, so what

Not the regular euphoric one week post, i have been here lots of times, and i always failed, so i don't want to celebrate just to loose my guard and fail again. Which i will work hard not to. 

From my experience, one week doesn't mean anything, i will consider myself out of the danger zone in six months. 

It is really great not to be smoking, with all the energy, time, sense of smell, oxygen, money and all, and i hope to write one month post that will be more uplifting :)

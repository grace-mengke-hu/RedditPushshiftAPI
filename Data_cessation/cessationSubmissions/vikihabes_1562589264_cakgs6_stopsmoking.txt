How do I get rid of cigarette odor in my room?

I have a room which I used to smoke in for 10 years. I quit cigarettes for good last year and I really want to get rid of the smell.
I’ve painted the walls, had my windows open for way too long to get rid of the smell, put an air cleaner in there, but nothing has helped. It still smells like the same as it did a year ago. Any tips? I’ve also got rid of the old furniture, but still nothing.

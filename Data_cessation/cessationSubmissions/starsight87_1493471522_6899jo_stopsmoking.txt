Day 5

Hey everyone,

So day 5 is here and aside from a continued lack of good sleep I am feeling better today. I am not waking up in a dense fog, and my energy feels a bit better today. 

Gonna go for a run today and start building my way up to 5km in 30 min. I haven't been able to run it in a 4-5 years and look forward to getting back to a good place. 

This group is awesome and today and best of luck to everyone today. Keep strong, no smoking and keep sharing your journey.

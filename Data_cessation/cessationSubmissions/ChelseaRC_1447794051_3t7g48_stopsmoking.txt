Bad breath..will it go away?

A guy I recently started dating confessed to me that he can taste the cigarettes in his mouth even after he's left hanging out with me. I don't smoke before seeing him and I make sure to brush my teeth and use mouthwash. I feel very embarrassed and it bothers me that it might cause him to not be attracted. 


So I've decided to quit for numerous reasons. My mother, sister-in-law and friends have urged me to quit for some time, and I have a new nephew. So what better time than the present? 


I've had one today, and am feeling great about my will power to quit. But I got nervous that the taste will still linger even after I quit. Any suggestions or encouraging words from experience on this? 


Thanks in advance!

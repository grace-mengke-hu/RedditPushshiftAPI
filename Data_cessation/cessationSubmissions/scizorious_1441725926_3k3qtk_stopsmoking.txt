One Month!

Yesterday made one month for me! The best part for me has been realizing how much tobacco controlled my life, and seeing how free I am.

I went to the state fair on Friday and they had a big stop smoking booth where they were handing out information on quitting. I didn't want to go up to it, but my girlfriend pushed me over and told them I had just quit. 

A firefighter was working the booth and I told him that Friday made 4 weeks, the longest I have ever gone without tobacco. He got a huge smile, reached out to shake my hand, and then did a bro-hug and said how proud he was... I was on the verge of tears at receiving such genuine excitement from a total stranger.

I got to sign a "I quit in the 2000s" board (I don't know why they didn't have a 2010s board) and got a button that is proudly displayed on the door to my office.

To everyone struggling and going day by day, know that there are so many who have gone before you, and are here to support you. Quitting takes a lot of courage, and by taking the initiative to quit, you are showing more courage than most.

Thank you to everyone in this sub for all of the support and success stories!

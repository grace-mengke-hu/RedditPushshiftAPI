Allen Carr just told me I'm no longer a smoker

I actually believe him.  I couldn't sleep last night so I downloaded his audio book "Easyway to quit smoking."  I stayed up most of the night and finished it this morning.

I feel great.  I just had my last cigarette and it actually made me nauseous.  I know that smoking is not a habit.  It's an addiction.  The addiction is temporary.  

Allen Carr didn't tell me anything I didn't already know and my god is his writing awful but sitting there and listening made all the pieces fall together like a jigsaw.

I am not a smoker, not now, and not in the future.

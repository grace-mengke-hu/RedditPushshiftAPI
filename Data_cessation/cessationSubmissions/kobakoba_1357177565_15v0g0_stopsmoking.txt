How long to wait before I can toke again?

I smoke weed and I have no intention of qutting that. However since I live in Europe, where we mix it with tobacco, I'm aware that I'll have to quit smoking weed at least for a little while to get rid of my tobacco addiction. I've decided to quit smoking tomorrow. When do you guys think I can safely smoke my next joint after that?

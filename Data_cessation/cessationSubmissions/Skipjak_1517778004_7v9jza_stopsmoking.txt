Quitting again - This time for real

Today is my third day of quitting. I quit before a couple of times, but relapsed. I just need to keep trying and learn from my mistakes.

The most important lesson for me being that taking puffs from doobies being passed around with tobacco as filler is a bad idea. One puff of nicotine is enough to re-activate the pathways in your brain that make you crave nicotine.  So, no more spliffs for me. Ever. 

I'm also taking a one month break from alcohol. I don't consider myself addicted, but I do show signs of early onset alcoholism (binging, tolerance).
So yeah, I feel kind of 'empty'. I lived an over-stimulated life, always either smoking, drinking, getting stoned, etc. I really need to learn to have fun again without stimulants. It's hard. That being said, as I'm typing this I'm listening to good music that's giving me goosebumps, haven't had this happening while sober in a while.

I wish you all the best of luck with your quit. Don't give up. Read John Polito's 'Freedom From Nicotine' (available as a free PDF), use the knowledge to your advantage. Keep trying, don't let a lapse turn into relapse.

What is the best advice to someone who should quite smoking?

My mother has been smoking for 30 years, she has tried to quite before but couldn't, then when my brother started smoking she really wanted to quit because she saw how it was affecting him, but she wasn't able to. She has been smoking for so long that it effectively is a part of who she is, and I am worried that she won't survive the next 5 years. She's survived cancer before, but sooner or later it will kill her. And I would rather it kill her later.

I stated to her that I would refuse to purchase her smokes anymore (She has the money to do it herself, but I go past more shops than her) and she got very emotional about it when I said i wish she would stop. I think if the addiction is so bad that if you get emotional about stopping, you need all and any advice there is out there

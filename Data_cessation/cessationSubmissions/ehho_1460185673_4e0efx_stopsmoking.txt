Started smoking after breakup (on 106 day)

I felt i would never smoke again really. And when break up hit me, it triggered me. 
i felt self destructive, not caring of i drink or smoke or choke on fast food. i still do a little bit.

My will isn't as strong this time, but i have to try. 
They say you need 90 days to make a new habit and 10 times more to break the old one.

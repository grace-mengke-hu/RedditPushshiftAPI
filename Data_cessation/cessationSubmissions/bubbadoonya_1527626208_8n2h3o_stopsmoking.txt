Only one day in..

I’m only one and a half day in an and as the clock is approaching five o’clock I’m not quite sure I’ll make it. My brain keeps telling me.. “only one more pack and then I’ll quit” .. “buy a pack and ration it out over the week”. 

Here’s to hoping I’ll be stronger than the addiction, at least for today...

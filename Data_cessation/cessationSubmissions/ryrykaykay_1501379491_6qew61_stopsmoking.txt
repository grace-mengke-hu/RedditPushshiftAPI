Day 1 - Complete.

Just wanted to share as this is the longest I've ever gone after 5 years of being a slave to cigarettes. I'm using lozenges so the cold turkey fight is still to come but I just wanted to get this down somewhere so it feels real and I won't just give in tomorrow. The desire is very much still there. I don't really know why. When I'm smoking, I hate it. When I'm not, I miss it dearly. What an evil thing.

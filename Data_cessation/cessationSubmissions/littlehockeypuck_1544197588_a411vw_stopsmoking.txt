You Can Do It!

I loved smoking, I did it for a long time. My favorite thing was to go outside while my daughter was asleep, and smoke by myself while watching the fireworks (my town does fireworks every Friday). That image is still romanticized in my mind, sipping on wine and enjoying a smoke. 

But I started to have night terrors, I was waking up 3-4 times a week in the middle of the night gasping for air and with dreams of the world ending. I think these were directly related to me smoking and possibly not breathing right. I could hear blood pumping in my ear while I was laying down.

So 7.5 months ago I quit. It was so hard, then not! I smell so nice. I haven’t had a scary gasping dream since I quit. I can breathe.

But it wasn’t always easy, it really put me in a horrible funk at times. I hated drinking wine without cigarettes, and sometimes that is still the case.

But the smoking depression has finally left me, and I was surprised that it would come and go this long.

I just want to tell you that if I can do it, you can too. If you get depressed, talk to someone. These  are real emotions, and it is so normal to have these thoughts. Smoking is your really crappy ex that you just broke up with, it’s going to take time to get over it. But ride the wave, and if you can have an accountability partner, then do it. 

Good luck!!!

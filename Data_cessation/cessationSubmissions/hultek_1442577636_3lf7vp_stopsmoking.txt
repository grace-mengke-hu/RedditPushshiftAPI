First 24 hours - observations.

Hey,

I posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/3la9cb/i_am_quitting_today/) yesterday that I am quitting. I thought I'd share few details from the first hours that passed, maybe that will encourage others to quit :)


* I feel better. Literally, my attitude is better and I don't feel sad or tired. I feel just fine.
* I want to eat. Usually when I was smoking, I didn't feel hungry until late afternoon. Right now, I ate breakfast and lunch and I'm thinking about eating more
* I cough a lot. That means the nicotine is leaving my body.
* I feel like I can achieve shit. I survived first hours, which were supposed to be the hardest. That makes me feel like I am up to bigger challenges.
* I don't have to carry around cigarettes and lighter with me all the time
* I DON'T SMELL. Well, I do, but that's because I have nice perfumes (Joop! NightFlight, women love that smell, trust me ;))


I'll admit - it's not super easy, but it's mostly mind playing with me. While in the store, I was thinking about buying cigs. But I refused, because I promised myself something and I'm not gonna screw it up.


Also - today we have company party, starting in few hours. That's gonna be tough, but I believe in myself and my ability to not fuck up this time.


GOOD LUCK TO EVERYONE QUITTING SMOKING!

Also, few words of encouragement that I keep repeating to myself: If It was easy, everybody would do it

For those in the 2-3 week period.

I slipped. I slipped into relapse. I had 16 days under my belt. My brain was telling me all sorts of things. 

Basically I am only posting this to admit that the only one theory is your brain being a dead beat. I am now the dead beat it wanted to be. For those thinking the same I tell you to fight. Fight on and don't give in. The smoke did none of the things I wanted it to and in fact I feel worse than I ever remember.

Stopped smoking today

I've tried it several times before, but this I believe to make it. Since the winter is coming and one cannot smoke inside pubs in my country, that will make it easier for me not to smoke when out with friends. Today has been one huge craving my fingertips are kind off numb, my breathing is heavy, I have a slight headache, I feel starving all the time, grumpy and and irritated, but so far I accept the symptoms as they and ready to finally quit smoking. It's pretty unpleasant but I keep telling myself it'll get better eventually, which it will. Wish me luck.

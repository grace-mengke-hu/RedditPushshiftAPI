41 days into quit, close to failing.

Hey fellow Redditors. I'll spare you the details but say that shit's going less than ideally in my life right now, the worst of which being my girlfriend and I are "on break". I'm having a real hard time getting through this and processing it emotionally. Am minutes away from going to the corner store and failing my quit. Anything you guys can say, or perspective you can give would be helpful. I'm here as a last ditch to stop myself from fucking up.

Edit: Thanks for the support everyone. It's been several hours and I still haven't smoked, and my craving feels like it passed for the most part. This will likely be an ongoing struggle for me though, but I'll do my best. To anyone who's reading this who commented below, seriously thanks, you guys really did make a difference.

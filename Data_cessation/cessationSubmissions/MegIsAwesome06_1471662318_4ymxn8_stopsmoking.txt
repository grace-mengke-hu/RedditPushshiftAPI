One week tomorrow

I actually hadn't planned on quitting last week, but I think God had other plans. 
I almost drowned last Saturday in the ocean. (No near death experience, I didn't even lose consciousness.) My teenaged son saved me and for the next few days I was vomiting consistently. Hourly even. It. Was. Awful. 
But it got me through 4 days of not smoking before I even realized I hadn't wanted one. Did some research and figured all the nicotine was out of my system anyway, so it would be stupid to start again. 
So today is day 6. We're back from vacation now, and I catch myself thinking of smoking, but thankfully I dumped all the cigs I had. If I'd kept them, I'd have smoked them. It seems easier than I thought. But that may be because I still have a raging headache for the past 6 days. I hate smoking with a headache. 
Anyway, thanks for listening.

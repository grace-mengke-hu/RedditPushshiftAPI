Relapse after 19 days...

I went out today, and I smoked. I can't blame the circumstances, it's all my fault. So I drank a lot with friends and went to a party. All my friends smoked so after two hours or so I couldn't take it and bummed a few smokes. I smoked 4 cigarettes throughout the night and I'm really feeling bad right now. Resetting the badge sucks.

I'm home now and I'm not sure how to feel. I'm disappointed by the fact that I'm quite weak and actually I can break down so easily and compromise my goals. 

Do I want to smoke as I wake up? Hell no, but this doesn't make my mistake any worse. I shouldn't have done it, and now I'm not sure how to feel. Feeling that you are a slave of something is much worse than all the rest. I can't imagine how drug addicts must feel. This sucks, I failed.

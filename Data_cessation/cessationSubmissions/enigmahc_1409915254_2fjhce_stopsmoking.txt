it's time for a badge

as already said in /r/trees, i've finally decided to quit smoking nicotine. i waited for few days to be sure this is the right tentative, and i hope now i can request a badge, finally.
it has been almost 1 year lurking here around and tried quitting almost everyday lol. so i just want to thank you all the inspiration i've got here around (so far - it's a long trip they say). 

anyway, it has been almost 5 days without nicotine and it's still craving so far, even if i can keep distracted more and more. i'm prepared to deal with 2 long months of craving

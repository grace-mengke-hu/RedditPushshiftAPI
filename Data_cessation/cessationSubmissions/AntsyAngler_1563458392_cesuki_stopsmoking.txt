I nearly blew it.

I quit smoking over a year ago (after smoking on and off for about 20 years) and I haven't had a single puff since I quit. I was at a festival for a week and ran into a friend. I asked him what he was smoking and was seriously going to roll up a smoke. Fortunately, he was out of tobacco. What a close call. I can't even imagine WTF I was thinking. A minute later I was back to not wanting cigarettes. Maybe it was just just seeing the friend that sparked the addiction or maybe it was being on vacation. I'm just glad I made it through. Next time I go to a festival, I'm bringing extra cinnamon sticks to chew on and hold.

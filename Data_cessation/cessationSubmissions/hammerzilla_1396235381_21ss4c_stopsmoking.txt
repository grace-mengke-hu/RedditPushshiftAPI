Im in

I went to my farm today to check the property out. On the way there,  i had to buy a pack for the trip.half way to the farm,  i bought two cartons to last two weeks. The thought that i had to buy smokes just so that i could go buy more smokes just dawned on me.

My girl won't kiss me until I've brushed my teeth after a cigarette and the smell after i walk into the house makes her not want to sit near me at all. I was about to have a smoke,  brush my teeth then go to bed.
But fuck that noise. I'm done, going to give the cartons away and throw out all of my lighters.

I'm going to make a list and keep it in my pocket about why i don't want to smoke. I know that lots of you have quit and frankly, i want a shiny badge :P.

Also, she asked me if i ever want to be able to run around with the lids we might have and that freaked me out. I don't want to not have that option i want to run and play and roll around in the grass with them as long as i can.

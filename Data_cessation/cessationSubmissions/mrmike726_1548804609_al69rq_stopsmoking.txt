Starting now

I need to stop before it’s too late. I’m turning 20 in a few days and I smoke all the time. I’m in college and I don’t really have anything else to do so I’ll just drive/walk around and smoke. It’s something that I know can really affect my life but I don’t even know where to start so I figured I’d post here and get the ball rolling. Any advice to stick with it?

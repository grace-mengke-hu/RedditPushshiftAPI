6 days. Actually looking forward to going to bed so I can call it a week!

This time I just stopped I woke up and I said "no I'm not buying any more, I'm not bumming. I'm done. I'm just fucking done". 
This month I lost my job, my relationship is a fucking disaster, my "career" (real estate) is going slowly, someone stole something from me of great importance, I'm so goddamn broke I feel like even if I WERE smoking this is easily one of the worst months of my life.. but how the fuck would smoking help that? It will cost me more money, it will relax me for 5 minutes; give me an excuse to wallow in a moment of self soothing and pity. My problems will still be there.
I downloaded the app Smoke Free and it's helpful and encouraging, but really it's all about me. I can't rely on anyone else for encouragement. (although the Doctor and Amy Pond applauding me was definitely a highlight of my day!)
How life has changed in the past week: I'm sleeping better than I did the first 3 days, no more night sweats, no bad dreams. I'm sleeping through the night and I'm going to sleep earlier and waking up earlier. Food does actually taste better, and fuck, yes, I'm eating a lot more of it. I'm drinking less, I did go out 2 nights and those by far were the most challenging nights and I was SO proud to wake up with LESS of a hangover and the knowledge that I didn't do it.

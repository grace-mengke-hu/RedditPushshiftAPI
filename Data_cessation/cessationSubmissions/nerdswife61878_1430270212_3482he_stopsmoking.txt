Need encouragement

Last week I had a migraine headache and couldn't sit up without getting sick so I didn't smoke at all for 3 days. I should also point out that I am on Welbutrin for depression and have noticed that I was smoking about half as much since starting it (pleasant side effect)

Well Sunday I caved and had 5 cigarettes, yesterday I had 4 and today 5. I hate just throwing them away especially with my anxiety disorder and may 'need' one now and then..... Has anyone else had trouble with this?

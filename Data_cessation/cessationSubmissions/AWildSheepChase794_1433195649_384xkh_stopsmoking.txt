I miss having an excuse to go outside

So it's a little over 1 day and I've only had 4 cravings so far (because I'm having a drink; I guess that's my trigger. The number was 2 when I started this post but the more I thought about it the more I wanted it). With the first one I ended up getting distracted by TV a completely forgot about it... The only reason why I didn't cave in was because I didn't want to restart by badge after only 1 day in front of all of you. Damn you peer pressure!!

But I'm realizing that I really miss having an excuse to go hang outside for a bit. I'm not one of those people that is comfortable just sitting there not doing anything, I get bored fast. I would go read outside but it's getting too dark. 

So I guess I'll just sit here. And smell them. And dream. Because that's totally normal.

EDIT: You guys are the best; thank you all for your replies. I managed to not smoke last night and plan on taking your suggestions and start doing them

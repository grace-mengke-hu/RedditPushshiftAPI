Starting right now. Questions and insight please.

So, I am tired of affording these cancer sticks, and I want to start running more, drop the last 40lbs. 
Any stories or advice on how running times or distance improved? 
After half a pack a day since I was 15, I feel physically sick and full of so much more potential than this.

I need help

I'm a slave to smoking. And I'm so tired of it. I don't want to smoke anymore. I tried Allen Carr's easy way and I made it to 15 days before i deviated from the program and had a cigarette. I never even finished the book entirely, I was so excited to quit that i did and so did my brother and his life partner. So I was right back to smoking, and so were they, and now smoking more than ever before. I tried to quit a few days ago and had one at work last night when being offered by a friend. I'm smoking one right now. And I'm trying to re-listen to Allen Carr's book but I'm scared it won't work this time around. What do i do? I tried the gum and the patches and I feel hopeless. Any help would be appreciated.

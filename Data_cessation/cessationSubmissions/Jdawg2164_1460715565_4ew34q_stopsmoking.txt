Just put out my last.

I'm done this is it. I've tried a few times and have had some serious victories and some crushing defeats  but from here on out I will stay strong and say no more. I've been lurking for awhile and you all have helped me gather the resolve I need if so many of you can continue to win then so can I!
I hate the way my hands smell
I hate the way it makes my car reek
I hate worrying how my breath smells 
I hate the money I literally burn every day
Thank you for existing and I can't wait to share my milestones to help encourage others

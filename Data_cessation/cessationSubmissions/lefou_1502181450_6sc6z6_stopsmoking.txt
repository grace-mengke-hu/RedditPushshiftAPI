Day 16: Girlfriend broke up with me tonight

Not much more to say than that.

My first thoughts were definitely, "Let's go have a drink and smoke."  I pushed away those thoughts. I don't want to smoke and I won't today at least. 

Still....sucks.

I've had a lot of trouble feeling happiness for the positive changes I've been making.  I feel like I've just been making them because I know I should, but it hasn't been bringing me happiness.  That said, I'm becoming more mindful and considerate of my body and that brings me some peace.

Over two years

It's getting close to 2.5 years now since I quit. I will never go back again. I have an occasional longing or desire, but easy to nip that quick when I think about how I'd actually feel if I went through it. I feel happy and free. It was challenging to quit, but worth it. Nobody regrets quitting smoking. If you are worried about quitting or struggling, keep going, it gets easier and you will be free! So happy. ðŸ˜Œ

Such a brain fog!

I've been on the wagon for the last year or so quitting a few months at a time and then starting up for a week or so. I've also been dealing with what I've labeled 'mental breaks' and 'derealization' where little things send me into huge anxiety attacks, depression, lethargy, and a sense like I'm not in control of my emotions. 

I figured these 'breaks' were set off by a breakup I went through, a big argument with a friend that was stressful, and I've always had anxiety but not this bad. 

But the more I think about it (and some knowledge gained after smoking for a few days in a row earlier this month) is that it seems to be caused by a year of nicotine withdrawal. 

I'm one week quit and really want to stay that way, but I'm feeling de personalized again and anxious and it's affecting work and my relationship with my boyfriend cuz I'm so dang nervous! I feel like I have to smoke again bc I don't want to feel this way any longer! I quit for over 2 months in the winter and it persisted.  

TL;DR : I've come to believe that the de personalization and mental breakdowns I've been experiencing for a year have come from nicotine withdrawal, and I'm tempted to start again rather than have these side effects affect my work and relationships.

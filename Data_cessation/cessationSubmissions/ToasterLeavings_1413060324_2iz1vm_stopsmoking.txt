1 year, 2 months and 3 days without a puff after 10+ years of chain smoking. A look back at what worked for me.

Hello friends.
After 10+ years smoking newports with the last 5 years smoking 2 packs a day I have stayed smoke free for over a year now. My previous quit record was 3 weeks so this is a huge success for me. I currently have zero desire to ever smoke again and I truly believe I have quit for life. Here are some of the things i did to finally do it, they may not be suitable for you but it worked for me.

From day one I kept an unopened pack with me at all times. This helped a TON with anxiety and is the first time I tried this while quitting instead of throwing my last pack away. I think a lot of my early success was because of this. At around the 4 month mark I was finally comfortable enough to give the pack away to a homeless guy outside of 7-11.

Something else I tried that was different from all of my previous attempts was going cold turkey. Gums, patches I tried it all and was finally successful using only will power. I highly recommend cutting out all nicotine completely.

I stayed away from this sub for the most part and didn't use any app to track progress. On previous attempts the first thing I would do in the morning is check my stats on a quit tracking app, then when I got in to work I would check this sub and another quit smoking forum or two multiple times a day. This time around I used no app and only checked support forums once or twice. I found in my experience it was best to keep my mind off cigs all together, even if that means taking away the positive stuff with it.


It still sucked.... It sucked bad. But a few weeks of hell for a lifetime of freedom is worth it. Like I said these tips may not work well for you but I wanted to share what finally did it for me, someone who was really close to giving up and being content with being a lifetime smoker.

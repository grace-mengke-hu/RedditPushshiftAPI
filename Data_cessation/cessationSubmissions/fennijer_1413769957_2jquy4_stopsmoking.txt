10 Days!! Thank you all :)

I've now tried to quit 7 or 8 times in the last 2 years..... I am trying so hard this time around. Avoiding alllllll temptation. Not drinking (sucks) trying not to eat too much (Booooo).... Friggin' bored!!

And then I found this site last night!!! Thank you! All of you!! Your honesty and stories are HI-larious and make me feel a part of something!

Now if I could just remember to BREATH... I'll make it.

Week Four - done tonight at 8pm!

A while back, someone posted, "I'm one cig away from a whole pack."  This has kept me clean thus far. At four weeks, I'm feeling great, but am still vulnerable if the environment and mind are wrong. Keeping my guards up, at least for another five months.

Thanks ALL here for your postings.  Whereas my family and friends think it's "nice" that I'm quitting, they don't really feel the pain like the people here.

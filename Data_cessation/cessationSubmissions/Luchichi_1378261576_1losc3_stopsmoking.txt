Just quit. Caved. Trying to get back on track.

I was going on 4 days when I caved and had one. Used to smoke between 1/4 and 1/2 pack a day. I know it's not the worst compared to pack a day and + smokers, but I caved after a particularly stressful day and smoked a cigg a stranger gave me. Still haven't bought a pack at least. Any tricks/techniques ya'll learned to ignore stress triggered cravings?

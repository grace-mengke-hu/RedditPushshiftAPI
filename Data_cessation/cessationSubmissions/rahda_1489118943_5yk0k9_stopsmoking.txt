Quitting for Good

Quitting for good. I have gone for 4-5 years of not smoking, only to find myself a smoker again on a few occasions. I have smoked for 20 years on an off, even if there were these breaks in it. This last time I have been smoking for about two and half years and I was more addicted than ever. This time feels like it. I am 37 and I am DONE with poison and just cannot handle it anymore. You are ready when you are ready. Well I am ready!  It is a journey to understand all the links and reasons why we quit. EFT tapping, journaling, putting in healthy vitamins and amino acids, meditation, acupuncture, energy work, supportive friends, and loads of water are all pieces that can be enormously helpful. We must be very gentle on ourselves in the process and allow ourselves time to be with our strong feelings and cravings and emotions that come forward. Understanding why we smoke, loving ourselves and caring for ourselves, helps a lot to release it. It also feels great to not smell, feel embaressed, waste money, kill ourselves and that other good stuff. focus on the positives. and just keep going one moment at a time, one day at a time.

I am here because I love the support of community! It is honestly such a simple and hard choice to make and sometimes it can be intense. I am around day 11 of no smoking and wow, sometimes it still creeps on me with cravings! 

Peace and love and take care you all. way to make empowered choices to create less stress, more vibrance, and a freer life!

One Week

I have been lurking here for about 4 days and finally decided to sign up.  I am a week smoke free and can't tell you guys how much reading what others are going through has helped.  It hasn't been easy but I'm determined to stay smoke free!  Been doing it for around 20 years so it's about time!

Happy 100 days :)

It's been a real rollercoaster this last 100 days - mood swings, dealing with cravings and triggers..so many changes... but it's going really well for me and I'm enjoining my new smoke free life. I didn't write many posts here but when I did I always got some great feedback from you guys so thanks for keeping me company for that last 100 days :)

My teeth whitening program kept me away from cigs!

Ex-smokers and exsmokers-to-be: not sure how strange of a tip this is, but I just started the Crest whitestrips home whitening program. I've also a huge consumer of black coffee and wine (three and three daily, but tackling one vice at a time) so my teeth haven't been the brightest. Taking on a teeth whitening program really boosted my confidence. Sometimes I think I need a cigarette, but oh man, I'd screw over all the new white. It's a bit vain - but it works. Kind of like your a new wardrobe is an incentive to avoid gaining weight. If you have yellowing teeth like me, might be worth a shot.

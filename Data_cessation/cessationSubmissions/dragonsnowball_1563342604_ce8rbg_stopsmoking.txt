Today was tough

26 days smoke free, 7 from nicotine. I had one of those cravings today... I have no idea what they're talking about when they say cravings last 5 minutes and then pass, that's HYSTERICAL! If that were true, why would anyone but people with intense ADHD find it so difficult to quit? My cravings last for HOURS. And they make me feel like I'm bipolar. Every fiber of my rational being wants to quit, yet for HOURS I can't get the idea out of my head about having a cigarette. So intensely that I feel like I've already had one! My brain feels so guilty for even having the thought.

Anyway, I did give in today and had half a nicotine lozenge. That is, after all, why I bought them. I'm pissed at myself for being clean a week and then putting more of this poison into my body. But I'll forgive myself and be kind because I am SO happy I didn't have a cigarette!

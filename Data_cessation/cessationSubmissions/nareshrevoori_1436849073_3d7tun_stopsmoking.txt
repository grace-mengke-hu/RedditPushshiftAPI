2nd day and i dont think i can hold on to it. Need help!!!

Damn, i thought i could do this easily but its not that simple. Stopped smoking since yesterday, got my badge and all went very well. I dont know about you guys but part of me inside saying - 

You think you can undo 15 yrs of damage by stopping it now? It wont do any good for you, your body is already doomed. Com'on, Go and give me some puff!!! You can start again if you really want to stop.

I need help, i dont think i can hold on much longer.

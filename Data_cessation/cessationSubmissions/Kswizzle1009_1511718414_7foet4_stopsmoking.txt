Yayyy! I got my patch! (:

I could scream it from the rooftops right now! Lol. I am so excited that I finally got my patch. This officially makes it official that I am a non smoker! I started smoking around 16 or 17, I recently just turned 25. It’s time I start growing up!

I’ve never felt better. (:

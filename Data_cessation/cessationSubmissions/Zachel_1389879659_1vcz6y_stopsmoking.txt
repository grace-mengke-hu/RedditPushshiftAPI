Help with cravings during specific actions.

Hi there!

I was hoping if any of you guys could give me some tips on dealing with cravings during specific events/actions.

What I mean is that, I personally associate drinking, and drinking beer very closely with smoking, without smoking the beer feels incomplete to me.

And it just so happens, that I'm going to a beer tasting thing soon, with a friend of mine, who smokes, so it's a double jeopardy there.

Now, I know some would say I should not drink or not go, but I don't really want to alienate my social life, and would much rather deal with it head on, so if anyone has any tips for keeping myself in check, this would be much appreciated!

Edit: After a long back and fourth in the bottom of this thread, I feel it necessary to add a clarifying statement to my post. I am not in a position to back out of my obligation, so I am asking specifically for advice to deal with the cravings when they come, and not advice on how to avoid my situation. 

Telling me to quit alcohol, or hold off on alcohol is a perfectly fine advice, but as I said in my original post, this isn't what I am looking for because it isn't applicable to my current state.

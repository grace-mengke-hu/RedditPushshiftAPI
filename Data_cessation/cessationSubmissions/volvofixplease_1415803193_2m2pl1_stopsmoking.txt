I relapsed,learn from me

It was my first time quitting for seven days but today i  had a smoke becouse of a really shitty day and another one and another one...
Please bear in mind the following im going to say:I was a miserable person when I was a non smoker and I'm a miserable person now that im smoking,it changes nothing
Thank you for all of your support but im leaving this subreddit with the knowledge that i will come back one day.Cheers

Anyone else having problems with their appetite?

I am constantly hungry since I quit smoking, and have had to be eating 24/7. It's like I can't get full. I've been chewing a lot of gum and have tried sunflower seeds but my food cravings are pretty insane and I just can't stop eating. Anyone else have this problem and/or any tips?

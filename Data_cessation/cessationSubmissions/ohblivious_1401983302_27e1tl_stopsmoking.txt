Up to a pack per day :[ How did this happen?

Dear r/StopSmoking, 


I'm really upset with myself. I'm up to a pack per day. I am in shock that I've let this go this far.

It is hurting me financially. REALLY HURTING.

But I find it so difficult to stop. I get stressed easily, and I reach for a smoke.

I've heard cutting down doesn't help, but I am thinking about making the switch to electronic cigarettes. 

Is the switch a good financial move or is it around the same cost per month?

Any advice is greatly appreciated.


Sincerely,
Wanna-Be-Quitter

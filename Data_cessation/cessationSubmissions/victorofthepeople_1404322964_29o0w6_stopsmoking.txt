Day 3 - Crying for No Reason, Bought a Pack

This is my fifth or sixth quitting attempt and the longest I've ever made it (pathetic, I know). This is my summer and the perfect time to quit because I am in a very stressful program at school. 

For some reason I was extremely emotional when I woke up and was crying all morning for no reason. Anyways, I passed a guy smoking on my way to the post office and it made me want a cigarette so much that I bought a pack. Smoked one but was immediately disappointed with myself. It didn't even taste good, apparently my sensitivity to the nasty smoke taste has returned. 

Someone convince me to throw away the rest of this pack. I hate wasting money throwing away perfectly good cigarettes.

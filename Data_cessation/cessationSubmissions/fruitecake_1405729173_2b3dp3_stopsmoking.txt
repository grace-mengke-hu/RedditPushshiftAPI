I got no shame but I keep relapsing!

Wanted to hear feedback from fellow quitters. I have smoked for 17 years now - 1 pack a day - I have graduated into menthols for last 1 .5 years as it takes edge off if you smoke more. 

Now I decided to quit seriously this year, my health is getting somewhat affected now, money, smell you name it. I have read so much, I can probably write a book on tobacco addiction now. I have quit 3-4 times longest being 3 months last year. But the best part is I have quit probably countless times for last 2 months (longest being 2 days and then 1 while week). 

Last night I had a dream with two nasty rattle snakes. No kidding. That's because I quit every day and then start again next. But I ain't giving up. I really want to quit, but then again I keep wondering what given in my damn mind that I actually do! Sick and tired of this whole mess. Wondering what to do - may be get "near life experience" or something to make it stick!!!

but hey, I got no shame - so I just quit again! hell I will try to make it stick.

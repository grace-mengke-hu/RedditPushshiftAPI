Well... here we go. Gotta start sometime and today is my day.

I'm 38.  I've been smoking since I was 17.  21 years at a pack a day for most of them, or even more than a pack if I was going out drinking.  Lost my dream job(or what I thought was my dream job) a few months ago due to stupid choices being made while drinking.  I quit drinking in July(drank once during the playoffs, I blame the Cubs).  Drinking wasn't all too hard to be honest.  I'm one of those drinkers that doesn't have a problem saying no to the first one, but the 12th, 18th, and 32nd drinks are where I have/had an issue.  I related really well to that stand up comic that showed up on reddit a few months ago: Drinking just one beer for me is like trying to fall down only the first step in a staircase.  

Now I've decided to go back to school in the spring, classes start January 8th.  The entire campus is smoke free, so I figured I need to get the ball rolling at some point.  My last cigarette was Christmas day of 2017.  Posting here for accountability so I can look back at this post and remember the reasons I am doing this and the feeling I have right now.  Thanks for taking the time to read this and I look forward to feeling better each day.  See ya round.

Quitting again for the 5th time

I’ve quit smoking many times before. I’ve never made it past 18 months at a time. I’m only on day 7 and I really want to smoke again! I just enjoy it but I know how terrible it is for my health and my (grown) kids hate it! I don’t know how to talk myself into staying smoke free! All advice, help, comments, encouragement welcome! Thank you!

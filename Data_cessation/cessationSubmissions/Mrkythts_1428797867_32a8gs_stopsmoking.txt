I haven't smoked in 24hrs...

Yesterday at this time I completely stopped smoking. I'm kind of cheating because I'm taking Wellbutrin. I didn't think it was working at first because I kept smoking the first three days I took it. But something happened yesterday, I had a revelation about smoking and it was that I could reconcile my addiction to nicotine by looking at it as a relationship. I think I've come to a point where I can finally say goodbye to cigarettes. I've read The Easy Way to Stop Smoking and it did help me in the past but for some reason this time it's a little bit different. I've decided to end my relationship with cigarettes. I almost felt like going back a few minutes ago but I came here for support and to read the experiences of others for inspiration so I can be strong and not go back to that horrible relationship. I know the next few days are going to be hard but I think I got it this time. I broke up with cigarettes and I'm not looking back. Thank u guys for posting ur experiences, they really do help!

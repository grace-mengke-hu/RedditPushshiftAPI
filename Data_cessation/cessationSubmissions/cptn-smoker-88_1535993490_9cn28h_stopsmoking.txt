Smoke Free app sent me here: can’t stop crying

Smoked on and off for 12 years. The last five years or so, I was smoking on average half a pack a day, more on party weekends. I’m on day 5 of cold turkey with Chantix - although I skipped yesterday’s dose.

I figured I could take advantage of the holiday weekend and ride out the withdrawal by staying in bed. I’m dead broke so it’s not like I can go out and buy cigarettes. I ordered a Juul but it doesn’t arrive till tomorrow.

The Smoke Free app told me to read at least 10 threads. I made it through four or five before I had to put my phone down. Is it the nicotine that makes me want to mourn smoking? I LOVED smoking, and I was nowhere near the amount some of you were at. I know why I should/will quit, but I feel really shitty about it, like I’m letting a fundamental coping mechanism go. When I was in the mental hospital a couple years back, everybody smoked, it’s what got us through - and when we got transferred to a non smoking facility those damn patches made us all worse.

I’m rambling. Sorry. But I really miss cigarettes.

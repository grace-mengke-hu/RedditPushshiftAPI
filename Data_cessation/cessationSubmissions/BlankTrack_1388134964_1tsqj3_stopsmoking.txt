Cigarettes Cause Stress Not Relieve It

Hey guys I am a nonsmoker, have been my whole life(tried taking a hit off of a couple of friend's) and I live with several roommates, most of which who smoke regularly. They say cigarettes help calm them down when they are stressed, but look at it like this.

Cigarettes cause an addiction to nicotine and when you smoke you feel relieved right? Well, lets say that I am stressed out from work. I'm working hard trying to get my stuff done so I can go out and smoke. I go out and smoke and feel better. Been there done that right?

But what if you just never felt the need to smoke in the first place? You get stressed out from work, and whatever other problems that are going on in your life. You don't constantly think about smoking, trying to find a time to get away, worrying that you are running low on cigarettes, forgot your lighter, bumming cigarettes, dealing with other cigarette bums and whatever all you nicotine addicts stress about. You are just adding an extra problem to your life that you need to spend large amounts of money and physically harm yourself and others around you(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondhand_smoke)(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirdhand_smoke) in order to temporarily relieve.

Just something to think about.

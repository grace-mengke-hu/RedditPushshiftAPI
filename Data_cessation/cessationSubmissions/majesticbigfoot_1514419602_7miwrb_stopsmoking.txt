Why all the vape hate?

A lot of people Iâ€™ve been around as an adult seem to think that vaping is dumb. Yes, there is sport made from it and thatâ€™s cool. But you know, out of all the shops Iâ€™ve been to, and all the people I know vaping, itâ€™s an advocate to quit smoking. You can get nicotine, but it keeps you from all the other nasty crap in those cancer sticks which is so much more harmful to your body.

Iâ€™ve been vaping for a few months now, and Iâ€™m happy to say Iâ€™ve been cigarette free. Even if it has nicotine, itâ€™s a baby step to get out of the habit. You work towards 0mg of nicotine and you can stop altogether. Baby steps, everyone. I did it after smoking for like 10 years and you can too. We got this, guys. ðŸ’–

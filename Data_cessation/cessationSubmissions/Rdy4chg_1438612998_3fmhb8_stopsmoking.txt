The mental battle has begun

Today marks my 8th day nicotine free. I have not touched any form of nicotine and definitely not smoked any cigarettes. I was having an easy time last week getting through the physical withdrawals. I felt super confident in myself that I could conquer this once and for all for life. There were some low points where I was on the verge of breaking down but I kept myself in line reminding myself why I needed to stay quit and the promise to myself to quit in the first place. 

I believe I wasn't mentally preparing myself for the mental struggle I am enduring right now and will continue to go through for some time. It's like I was in denial that this quit was for real and for the rest of my life. It really hit me hard Friday night when I went out drinking and didn't smoke. I think that was the point it came to be consciously that the quit was for real and that I will never have my "crutch" I have become so dependent on. Nicotine made me feel happy and alive but at the same time was killing me and making me miserable. It was breaking me down both physically and mentally. 

Here I am today without any nicotine left in my body and now have to endure the misery I have subsided in myself for years by masking it from drug abuse. I am truly afraid of the hell I am going to go through the next few weeks, months, years, or however long it takes to finally conquer whatever is causing me to become reliant on things to make me happy. I really hope that the misery I go through will strengthen me as a person both mentally and physically. 

I will come out a stronger person who is confident in himself and able to take on any challenge I am faced with. I will no longer be controlled by a substance or my substance enduced mind. 

Any tips from anyone who has gone through this similar misery please either pm me or comment. Would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for reading. 

Congrats to everyone who has quit and is staying strong. Together we can do this.

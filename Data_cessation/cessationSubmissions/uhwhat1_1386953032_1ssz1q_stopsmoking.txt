Day 5 I was lucky.

So i randomly got fed up with cigs and decided to quit 5 days ago.
but i was pretty lucky because the first day i was all pumped and ready to quit and the BAM i got the flu like i never have before. so for the past 4 days even though ive been craving cigs i cant physically smoke any if i wanted to without throwing my chest into convulsing cough fits. So yes it sucks that im sick right now but on the plus side im really not craving cigs anymore. 
maybe to trick is to go smother yourself all over a sick person the day you decide to quit.

Need help to motivate a loved one

Hey guys,

first time in this sub, since I´m a non-smoker.

I need your help precautionery: My Dad was diagnosed with lung cancer on Dec. 20th (we don´t know yet what the next steps are since there are more tests pending) and he has decided to quit after about 40 years of smoking. I believe him, but I want to be prepared, if he has problems quiting. My Mum also smokes and decided to quit as well. I want to support her, too. 

Could some of you share ways you where supported or things you feel would have supported you in quiting? Thanks so much in advance!

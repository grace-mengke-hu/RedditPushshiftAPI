Sadness - normal and not entirely helpful 😐

So I am feeling super low right now. Part of quitting I was expecting it’s arrival. 

I wanted to smoke - or continue to want to smoke - when I am feeling strong negative emotions. (Other quits it was when I felt any strong emotion so I suppose that is something of an improvement that it’s hardest only with the strong negative ones.)
I’m also turning 40 next month, and I am honestly looking forward to this upcoming new decade of life! I’m down because over the years I’ve  managed to be so unfortunate of a human that no one is interested in celebrating that I’ve existed for 40 years, and made many accomplishments after walking straight through hell. It’s just a little sad that at this place in life, when I’m looking back at all I’ve gained these years and facing forward to all that’s awaiting me, no where do actual adult people seem to show up. 
When I’m sad or down or angry - that’s when I smoke the most. To keep the tears at bay, to inhale this emotions into their rightful place...I’m an excellent social worker for the population I serve and still struggle with the whole following my own advise piece at times 😂
Anyway. I journaled earlier and it made me weepy. So I thought I would reach out here as well to help me in not sitting with this heavy sadness all alone. 

Thanks for reading pals. I’ll be back to everyone’s cheerleader in the next few days. 

In the meantime - KEEP ON ROCKING YOUR QUIT! Everyone is doing amazing, showing up here means your doing amazing at reaching out and trying so hard to stay on task and you’re all admirable. I’m glad we can all be on this journey together 😁😁😁🤩🤩🤩

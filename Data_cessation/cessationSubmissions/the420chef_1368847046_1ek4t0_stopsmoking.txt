3+ weeks and still going strong! Thanks r/stopsmoking!

I had tried to quit once and I made it 2 weeks without any major hitches. I didn't get any major mood swings, or anxiety. I was fighting my brain for 50% of the time, killing that little voice in my head. Then after that 2 weeks I had a Bucks Weekend. I lasted half a day. I was surrounded by 6 people, each of them smoking. I don't understand why, but I decided to light up. I smoked for 2 months after that, every single cigarette was a little failure and I could never truly enjoy any. Yet quitting seemed so distant and difficult. 'I'll find a day' sort of thing, so I set a date.


I was getting my wisdom teeth out, so I decided that it would be a great kicker to quit then. I had a rather convenient reason, but I still set a date and kicked it so far. I even managed to convince my friends to give quitting a go. They're doing well so far. They have had one or 2 here and there, but they don't smoke around me, possibly out of respect. If I'm honest, I wouldn't mind if they smoke around me, I hate the things now. I went to the pub 2 weeks in and was constantly surrounded by smokers, was offered multiple smokes, rejecting them all. 


I dunno why I wrote all this. I think its because I saw this sub-reddit when I was first trying to quit. Seeing all of these people with the same struggle as me, reading their stories and hearing of their successes, it just inspired me. 


So thank you r/stopsmoking, all of you. You helped me in this life. I only hope that this somehow gives someone else the encouragement to stop lighting up. Be strong. :)

Quit it

 I quit in 2011 and then after my daughter was born and stopped nursing I would just start as an excuse during her nap time. I always wear an overcoat so as not to smell like cigs, but I know I've got to âœ‹ stop. I've been a heavy smoker again for about 7 months, like chaining. I've got plenty of excuses but I'll spare you all.

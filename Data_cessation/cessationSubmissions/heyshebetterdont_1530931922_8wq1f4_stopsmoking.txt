What are the IMMEDIATE benefits of quitting smoking?

I apologize because I just posted. But my husband said to me, “yeah I know there’s future benefits. But what can I look forward to RIGHT NOW? I need something to look forward to in days rather than weeks.” I’m sorry if I’m annoying. I just want to help him. Any advice?

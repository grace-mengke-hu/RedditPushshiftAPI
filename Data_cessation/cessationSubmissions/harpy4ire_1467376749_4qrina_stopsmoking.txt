Shredding the cigarettes

Night before I quit and I'm excited. Nauseous, but excited. Been doing aversion therapy today and it's strengthening my resolve. Four smokes to go and I can't do this anymore. I'm shredding them

I'm feeling awful. Hacking, flushed, disgusted. I am actually retching. This is a condensed version of what I do to myself every two days. And oh lords does that just make it worse. Just two days worth of cigarettes leaves me feeling this bad. Imagining the ten years I've smoked... *shudder*

And I can't wait. I've quit smoking three times now, ranging from two weeks to five months. I know the next few weeks are going to be awful, I know I'll be bad tempered and a little murderous for the next week or so. But I remember how much better I felt, physically, after just one week not smoking. I remember how frankly *intoxicating* it was to just breathe and feel my lungs expanding so far, taste and feel how clean the air was. I remember how amazing it felt to get to one month free and feel so, so energetic. Being so happy to realize I didn't stink anymore, that I didn't have this awful taste in my mouth

Being free of this will be amazing. Bring it on!

Sidenote: I will be grumpy tomorrow so if anyone does comment I apologize in advance for not replying

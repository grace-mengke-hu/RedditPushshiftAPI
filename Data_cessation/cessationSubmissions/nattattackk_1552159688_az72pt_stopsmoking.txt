CRAVING RIGHT NOW

Arrgggggghhhhhhh! It’s been a month and 5 days and I am so proud but this craving has hit me out of no where! I can’t get it out of my head, and the voice will NOT stop. Just one, it’ll relax you, it won’t mean anything, you smoked for years anyway, no one will know. Trying super hard to block this out but it’s not a subsiding craving. Help??

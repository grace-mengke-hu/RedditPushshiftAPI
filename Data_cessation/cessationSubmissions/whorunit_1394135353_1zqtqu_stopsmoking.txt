Almost a month without smoking ...

First off, I wanted to say that I decided not to count days this time around. I've tried to quit 20+ times and every single time I counted the seconds since my last cigarette. This time around I decided I was just going to stop and whenever I would normally check my iphone app for how long I have quit, instead I just tell myself "What are you looking for? You are not a smoker". It has worked great. I have also been using an E-Cig. It has helped immensely. I am already vaping 0% nicotine juice and only puffing a few times a day. I cannot speak highly enough of e-cigs as a quitting tool. I have tried everything and this is truly the first quit attempt that I have 100% confidence in myself that I am no longer a smoker. My main issue (and I think for a lot of people) is that the habit of actually smoking is the hardest to break. Certain activities just trigger me so hard, and that is how I have always failed in the past. The e-cig prevents those relapses from happening (for me) and all it takes is two or three puffs. 

The e-cig may still be a bad habit, but I cannot even describe how much healthier I feel than when I was smoking. As a smoker, I had constant angina (vague pain in the heart area). I had it almost 24/7. I had to stop working out because I literally thought every time I went to the gym I might have a heart attack. Palpalations would always set in right away. Since starting with the e-cig, I am back to running and lifting 5 days per week and I feel better than I have in the last 10 years.

Just wanted to post this in case any of the above tactics are useful to anyone out there. Good Luck to you all!

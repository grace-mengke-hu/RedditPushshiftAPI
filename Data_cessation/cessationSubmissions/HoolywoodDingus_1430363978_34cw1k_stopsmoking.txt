Getting through the first week

The hardest part of quitting for me so far was the first week. I tried and failed a few times before getting through the week and once I did, quitting became much easier. When I failed it was because I was over-thinking cessation (trying to redefine myself and my mental processes). For me, the first week was not about self-discovery. It was about brute force, and after I had gritted my teeth for a week I had invested too much to go back to smoking. The first week was shitty and I got road rage and I was a dick to my friends, but after a week it got easier and it has gotten easier since then. Since the first week I have been able to grow as a person without the crutch of cigarettes, but the first week was sheer tyranny of will and I didn't learn anything except how to survive a shitty week.

tl;dr it gets better so use as much strength as you have in the first week and don't worry about the rest.

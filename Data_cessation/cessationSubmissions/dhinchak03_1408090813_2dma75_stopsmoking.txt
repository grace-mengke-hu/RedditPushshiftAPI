Almost 2 months. I am so proud of myself!

It hasn't been easy - definitely not! There have been days when I felt a cigarette would set everything right. 

My digestive system is still coming to terms with lack of nicotine. I have had stomach cramps, bloating and diarrhea for many days. 

The thought that keeps me from smoking is that I know that I can't go through such horrible time again. This is the last time I am going to suffer from Nicotine withdrawal symptoms. 

The feeling of freedom is priceless. It's great to know that I'm not dependent on a stick of shit to make me feel better :D

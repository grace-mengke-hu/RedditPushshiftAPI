Do you have dreams in which you end up smoking?

Hi all, 

I haven't smoked in around 4.5 months (barring the odd joint which has some tobacco), and I feel absolutely great. However, lately I've been having dreams (particularly if I go to sleep after having a few drinks) where I cave and smoke a cigarette or two. Then at some point the next day I feel guilty, think back and realise that it was just a dream. 

I was just wondering if anyone else has been through this during their quit.

Cheers

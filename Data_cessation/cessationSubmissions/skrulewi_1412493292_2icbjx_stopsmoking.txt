Six Months, came and went, didn't even notice.

Holy how. I had my last smoke April Fools day, October 1st came and went and I totally spaced it out.

I would not have made it without this reddit. I am an active member in /r/stopdrinking, and I'm even getting involved as a Mod for a local PDX Stopdrinking thing. I know this is stopsmoking, but for me, it's been an amazing experience all around with these reddit support forums. These have been the most helpful, most genuine, busiest support groups I've found online. It's something special, and we should all contribute a bit more. This forum, and all the different forums, are amazing. I would not have quit smoking if I hadn't been posting in stopdrinking for three months, seeing that goddamn /r/stopsmoking on the sidebar, constantly fucking with me, fucking with me, reminding my hypocritical ass that I have to put this poisonous shit down. Much love and take care to all!

Thanks for my six months, guys and gals.

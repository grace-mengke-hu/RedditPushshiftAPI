That didn't last too long...

I went 26 hours without any form of nicotine. All day at work I had to keep taking breaks to go cry; I was especially terse with customers over the phone; my legs and back were killing me. After work I kept having crying spells and extreme depression fluctuations.

I should be asleep right now, but I'm in so much physical pain from my back and so much emotional pain that instead, I'm sobbing like an idiot and smoking.

I've suffered from major depression and panic disorder since I was 13. I've been hospitalized for serious suicide attempts. I am truly terrified right now because I'm feeling the same deep depression that I used to feel before I got medicated and started therapy. I'm having to lock away all my knives, it's that dark.

My insurance doesn't currently cover therapy, so I have no path there. I'm going to have to make an appointment with my general doctor to see if there are any additional medications I can take so I don't end up slitting my wrists while quitting.

If you have no experience with clinical depression, please don't reply. Please don't tell me to just bear with it, to watch something happy or funny, or do any of the other commonly-recommended activities posted on here. I am not depressed because I cannot smoke; the taste of this cigarette is nauseating and I hate it.

I also quit while I was still in the middle of reading Allen Carr's book.

Many of you have suffered very mild mood swings and reactions to quitting; that's great, and I envy you. But I know my disorders and body, and I think I'm one of those who needs watching over by a medical professional while doing this so I'm alive by the end of it.

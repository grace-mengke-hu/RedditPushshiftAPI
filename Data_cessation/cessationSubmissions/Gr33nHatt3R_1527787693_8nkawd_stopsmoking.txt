A thank you thread for /u/WhiskeyRider69

Hey Whiskey, I hope all is good with you! I just wanted to say that you've been an amazing peer here at r/StopSmoking. I know a lot of us here feel the same. You are almost always the first to comment and always have a kind word of encouragement. You have kept me strong in my quit and I am sure in many others as well. I know you've been having a rough time as of late, but stay the course my friend. We all care about you over here. No matter what, you have a community here with us. Thank you Whiskey, from the bottom of my heart!

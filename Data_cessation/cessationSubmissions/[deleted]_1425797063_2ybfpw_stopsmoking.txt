December 31, 2014

was the last time I smoked a cigarette. I just found this subreddit, and I really don't want to tell anyone irl cause it's always jinxed, but I am pretty happy about it! Started when I  was around 12, 25 now. Wanted to quit before I was 21 but always made excuses. I moved away from family and friends and now that I don't have everyone around me constantly smoking I've totally been able to go cold turkey. I still love the smell of burning tobacco, but I'm so thankful for being able to breathe again.

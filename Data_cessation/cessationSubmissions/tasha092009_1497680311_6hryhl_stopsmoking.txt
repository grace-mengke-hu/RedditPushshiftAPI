I still struggle on day 13

I've been smoke free for 13days now and I still have feelings of wanting to smoke. Luckily I know mindfulness and can block it out of my head, as well as breathing, counting and drinking water.
It feels OK atm, but I've been 30days smokefree before and I slipped back into smoking. 
Doesn't help that I'm also an alcoholic and haven't had a drink for 15days. I'm hanging out for one. But I won't, as I have blood test coming up. But still, once I do have a drink again, how am i supposed to not smoke. I dont have a single friend that doesn't drink alcohol, so I can't see myself as a non drinker.

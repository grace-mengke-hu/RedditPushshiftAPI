14 years smoking... how do I quit?!

Ive done cold turkey, ive tried ecigs but every time my life likes with stress cigarettes are always my go to! This past month ive cut down from a pack a day to 5 cigarettes a day but thats still too much! Lung cancer copd and emphysema run rampid in my family and I need to quit for the best... but it makes me feel so good! Or so I led myself to believe. How do I quit without snapping necks in the midst?

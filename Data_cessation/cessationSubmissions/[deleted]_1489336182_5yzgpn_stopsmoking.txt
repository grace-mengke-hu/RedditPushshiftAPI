27 Hours & My Brain Feels Like a Lump of Play-Doh

Yeah, that's pretty much it. Forming a coherent thought feels like it's being squeezed through a pinhole in my brain... Wait, did that even make any sense???

I ate a pint of ice cream and a half dozen chocolate chip cookies last night AFTER I ate an entire box of mac & cheese and an entire pound of salmon... thankfully, I passed out in a food coma around 830 p.m. or I wouldn't be able to fit through my front door today...

I have no effing idea where I'm going with this post... 28 years and this disgusting habit is ingrained in EVERY little thing I do... I found myself really craving one and bargaining with myself once I got to work this morning... I had to remind myself that they taste and smell like burning ass (not that I know what burning ass smells or tastes like) and that my decision is final... I do have a vape pen with 0 nicotine and I'm clinging to it- I've already bitten my nails off and chewing on pens wasn't working...

Feel like I'm at a crossroads, want to stop before it's too late

I've always considered myself a casual smoker, started at 15 when it seemed like a cool thing to go out and have a casual drag with the older kids but I'd never have my own. Then it got to the point were I brought my own packs but only smoked when i was drunk. Then I'd buy a pack and ration that out over a few days. 

The last couple of months or so I've been lucky if a pack lasts a day. Was quite shocked the other day when talking to my best friend (who doesn't smoke) and described myself as a casual smoker and he laughed and said "fuck off man, you're smoking everyday. That's not casual."

I hadn't even noticed the change really, it just kind of creeped up on me. 

Now I feel quite torn. On one hand I still enjoy it and love just hanging out with a few casual beers and cigs. On the other hand the vast majority of my friends don't approve of it and I can't even imagine going a day without. Hell drinking and not smoking just seems so fucking alien to me, they go hand in hand in my mind. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is I'd love some advice and to get pointed in the right direction on how to quit. I'm still young (20) so I feel like I should get out now while I still can.

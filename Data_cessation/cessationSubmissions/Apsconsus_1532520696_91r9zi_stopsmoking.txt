How vaping is helping me quit

I had my first cigarette when I was about 11 or 12 and by the time I was 17 I was buying my own and fairly addicted.  


I'm 22 now and I've bought a 20g pouch a week for the past 3 years or so and recently decided to try and quit.  


I went cold turkey once and that was because I had the flu and couldn't/didn't want to smoke anyway. I managed about a day after feeling fine again before I went back to it. I work in a call centre so it's difficult to avoid it.  


Right now it's been a week using a vape (with nicotine) and I feel great. Sure, I'm still addicted to nicotine, but I'm getting a substantially lower amount( I had a cigarette after a day of just vaping and got headspins) and my lungs feel much better.  


I've stopped coughing a lot, I don't have any phlegm, I don't wake up with my throat clogged (I also snore so that doesn't help) and I'm even going longer periods of time without vaping as I'm breaking some of the habits that I'd do with smoking, such as smoking after eating.   


While this isn't to say that vaping is totally okay for you, it's definitely better than smoking. I couldn't tell you any facts on the long terms of vaping, but I can say that it definitely helps in the short term.  


If you do decide to try it my best advice is to start vaping the next day, as you will lower your nicotine amount and it can be difficult going from smoking to vaping in the same day (definitely not as hard as cold turkey).  


If you live in Australia like me, it's also much cheaper.   


As someone who couldn't have imagined not smoking as I rely on it so much, this has been eye opening for me, and I'd recommend anyone who wants to quit to do the same if the idea appeals to you.

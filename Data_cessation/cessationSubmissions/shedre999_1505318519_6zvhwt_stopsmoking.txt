How long did it take for you to stop craving a smoke?

Just curious to crowd source when people stopped feeling cravings. I'm 16 days in, and was a "social" smoker to begin with (although I was morphing into more of a daily smoker, which is why I decided I needed to quit), and my cravings are definitely less than they were at first. I still really crave a cigarette at least once a day, and REALLY crave one when I'm with my friends who are smoking.

How long did it take you for this to go away, or for you to at least stop feeling like you were just on the verge of asking for a drag of someone's cigarette? I need a little motivation that I won't feel this way forever!

want to quit and have tried.. Feel like I'm not strong enough to...

I'm 19 year old F. Started smoking when I was about 13 years old.. addiction just slowly took off from there. I'm sure many can sympathize.
Anyways, I'm going to be 20 this September. The longest I've gone w/o smoking was probably 2 months, and that was when I was maybe 16yo. So f*cking embarrassing to say. I'm goddamn weak.
I also have exercise-induced asthma. But from smoking, I sometimes need use my inhaler twice a day. In high school I had an eating disorder, bulimia, it continued for about 2 1/2 years. I stopped in around February of this year. I definitely struggle with my weight and body image. This is also very embarrassing to admit. I just want to be honest. And I know, it's better to gain a few pounds than be a smoker. I'm not sure where this stemmed from, but I'm 5'2" and used to be 125lbs. I'm now at 103lbs, not just from smoking, but dealing with body image issues.
It sucks. I have the will to quit smoking, just feel powerless.
I need some motivation. I need some kind of skill, so I can just quit and not have the cravings and stress that follow. I smoke for any reason. I smoke when it's cold (that's my favorite), I smoke when the sun is beaming down on my shoulders and face (that's the worst). I smoke after I exercise. I smoke when I'm sad. I smoke when I'm thrilled. I smoke when I'm on the phone. I smoke when I'm bored. I smoke when I'm angry. There's not really a special time when I'm not smoking except to take a shit, sleeping, eating, or working. This sucks. I want to be better than the cigarette. I want to be strong. Could use some kind words or other's personal experiences. I really want my life back.

I'm done

I quit smoking and started vaping about five years ago. Then I started a new job as a truck driver. My vape was broken and I went back to the cigarettes unfortunately. It's been about 6 months now. I feel like every time I do drop off or pick up I get stressed out and I want a cigarette really bad. I've been trying to vape again and I really prefer cigarettes over vaping. But I've been having some heart palpitations and the general side effects of being a smoker aren't great so I decided to not buy any more cigarettes and just use the Vape about two days ago. I know I can get through it but I still have that cigarette craving every time I do drop off. Also it feels like I have bronchitis now. Did anyone feel like they had bronchitis after they quit?

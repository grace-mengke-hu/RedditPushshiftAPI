first day smoke free as a recent cancer survivor

this is so hard. as awful (and backwards) as it sounds smoking made the hards times during the cancer stuff tolerable. curbed that difficult edge. but now i feel alone to face the world and everything and feel extremely unsettled. ill make it tho!!!!!

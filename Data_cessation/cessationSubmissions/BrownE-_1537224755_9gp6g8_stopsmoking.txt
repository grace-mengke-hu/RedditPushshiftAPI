Just passed a full year (September 5th) sober.

I’ve been a bit of a lurker on this subreddit for a few years, but hearing everyone’s stories and ways to stop smoking has helped. 

Cold turkey for a year was caused discomfort but holy hell I feel like I can breather better.

Thanks everyone for sharing you’re experiences, it helps!

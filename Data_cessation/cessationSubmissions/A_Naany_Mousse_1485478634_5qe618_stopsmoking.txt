I "quit" 6 years ago but am in the middle of a relapse I can't shake. Not sure what to do.

6 years ago, I quit using tobacco. I had been someone who would smoke a few times a day, and more heavily socially, especially when drinking. 

Over the years I've had several mini-relapses. Maybe buy a black n mild or some single cheap gas station cigar, take a few puffs before bed at night, and that be it. Maybe do this for a few days, or a few weeks, then I'd be done with it for months. I would smoke occasionally, but I never *needed* it. I often went without for long spans. 

Lately, I was in a period where I was doing pretty good, but this holiday season I relapsed and can't shake it. I got in the habit of what is equal to 1 cigarette a day (cheap "cigar" from the gas station that's basically just a flavored cigarette). I quit for like 5 days, but got insomnia bad, and I had some important meetings and things at work I had to be focused on, so I started again.

Biggest thing for me is I noticed what appeared to be cognitive benefits after smoking for a bit. I feel more alert, positive, and less mentally fatigued. I also feel a little happier and more focused. This could be attributed to other factors as well, I'm just really not sure. I've also been depressed and smoked, and I can't say it really pulled me out of it. 

Guess what I'm trying to say is I'm not sure where to go from here. I feel like the 1 cig per day is helping my mind at work and at home, but at the same time I don't like being tied to it. Thought about gum, but I think that'd be even more nicotine per use than the 1 cig. I'll probably pull through these tough times at work and quit again soon, but I'm not sure how to quit for good or if I even want to.

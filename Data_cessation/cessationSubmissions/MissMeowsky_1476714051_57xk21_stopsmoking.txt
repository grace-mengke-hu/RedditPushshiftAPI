230 days and one break up later...

I don't know how I didn't go back to smoking... The last two weeks have been so hard... My BF of 1.5 years left me very suddenly and my heart is broken beyond what I've ever experienced in my life... I don't think I've ever loved anyone as much as I loved him... and I'm not saying this lightly... at my age, I have enough experience to know how different this feels... And the call of the cigarette has been strong... but I'm pushing through... I'm trying to concentrate on what I need in my life, and what I don't need... It took me so long to finally get away from this nasty thing, I don't want to get back to it no matter the circumstances in my life... But some days are really fucking hard...

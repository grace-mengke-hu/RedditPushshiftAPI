Coooooooooonstant Cravvvvvings have just started this morning!

After days of not having cravings, or at least not cravings worth even mentioning, I am having cravings.  It's Friday and I want to smoke, I don't know what one has to do with the other, but that's what popped into my head.  It's almost the weekend, time for a celebratory smoke, etc.  So stupid.  I grabbed some gum and it's almost gone.  Anyway, no one here smokes menthols and no.  Can't do the car exhaust flavored smokes.  I'll get through it, it's just the cravings that come out of nowhere are so frustrating.

Made it through my first week!

I'm so extremely happy and proud I've completed my first week without even a puff of a cigarette. I was a smoker for 6 years, and I'm super stoked to be able to say I *was* a smoker. I'm starting how to notice how other smokers smell like shit haha and how I can already breathe a bit better. So happy that I found this subreddit when I did, I never thought I would make it to a week. I posted a couple days after I first quit completely hopeless, but coming on this subreddit everyday and seeing/feeling the support has been so helpful. Keep up the good work everyone! You can do it!

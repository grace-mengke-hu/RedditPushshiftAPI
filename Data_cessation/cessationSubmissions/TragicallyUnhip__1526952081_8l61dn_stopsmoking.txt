Relapsed after 6 days and beating myself up.

I quit smoking  6 days ago, cold turkey. The first two days were hell, but for me the phsycial withdrawals were gone by the end of day 3 \(I'm incredibly thankful for this, because I'd assumed they would last much longer\). Unfortunatly, the psychological withdrawal was what got me. Tonight I was bored and I smoked simply becuase of that. I know, what a lame reason right :\( Its not like I haven't been bored at all the past 6 days, but I just gave in tonight. And it wasn't even worth it! I feel incredibly guilty now, and would give anything to have that boredom back. 

I'm determined to not slip up again. I'm reminding myself why I quit \(health, money saved, freedom from addiction, etc\). I threw away the pack, in the dumpster outside. I gave my fiance my wallet and told him not to let me buy more. I'm not giving myself the opportunity to make the "just one more" mistake again.  My worry is...will I have to go though withdrawal again? I did it once and if I have to I'll do it again...but I'm hoping and praying that its not \*as\* bad this time. Am I kidding myself?

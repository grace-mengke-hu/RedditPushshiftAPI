Tonight is the night (dipping tobacco)

Tonight is the night I quit dipping tobacco once and for all

I'm sick of spitting

I'm sick of gator lip

and i'm sick of withdrawals

I want to be free from tobacco's grasp, it's had me since I was 15 

I just threw out my remaining logs of chew, any advice you guys can give? It's my first time actually quitting.

Is there a method to this?

Hi, over 40 female here. Been smoking for a little over a year as kind of a "try it once in my life" type of thing. Now it's time for me to stop. I'm having surgery soon and I'm using that as a trigger to stop smoking. The surgery has nothing to do with my smoking. But, I'll be immobile for a good two weeks and running outside for a cigarette every half hour or so will not be an option. 

So, should I go cold turkey? Or is there a better method of approach?

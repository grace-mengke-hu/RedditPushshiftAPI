Can anyone relate?

My main reason for stopping using snus and cigarettes has been, aside from spending too much money, has been the emotional rollercoaster. It felt like I was exhausted all the time (not physically exhausted) when using nicotine regularly. Your mind can't balance between the nicotine craving and having enough of it in your system, so your brain is an emotional mess. At least that's how it felt like for me, and I couldn't take it anymore. Anyone feeling the same or is this just some placebo?

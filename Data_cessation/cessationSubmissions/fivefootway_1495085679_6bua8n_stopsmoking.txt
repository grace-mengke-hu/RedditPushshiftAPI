72 hours in...headache is the worst bit.

stopped for about 6-7 months last year, started again, and then after a series of on/offs, decided to pull the trigger this week.
so, here we are 72 hours in, and it's been different from the last major stoppage! I'm not sure why that would be so, but it is. re: the last time, what I remember the most is feeling absurdly emotional, but not so much in terms of physical side-effects. now, I'm more or less fine, except that I have get this periodic, low-intensity tension headache, like there's pressure on my forehead, the sort you might get after reading very small letters for an extended period of time, and you'd have to massage your forehead. anybody else get that? not sure why it would be different now. 
I also recall that 5-7 days in was the hardest bit the last time. here's hoping this time is easier!

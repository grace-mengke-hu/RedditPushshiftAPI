It's Day 1 for me.

I know, compared to other people I've been a relatively recent smoker with just starting in January of this month but I made the decision today to stop smoking and I'm afraid of all the ways I can fail but I'm trying to keep my head held up high and quit while I can although I've been trying for a couple of days but always revert to one more. I hope I can make it this time.

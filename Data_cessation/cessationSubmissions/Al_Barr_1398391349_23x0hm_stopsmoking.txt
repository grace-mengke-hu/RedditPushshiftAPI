Hospitality Workers...

Ok.  So far, so good.  I'm doing ok through the beer and coffee.  I did, however, just make an incredible meal and really wanted to smoke.  But I came here and am doing ok.

My real question concerns fellow restaurant employees.  I've worked three slow lunch shifts this week, no stress, short and on my way home.  I serve tomorrow (Friday) night, where it will be the normal nuts for a long time, when the urge is going to come upon me at about hour six.  

How do y'all deal with the 'break'?  Or not really having one, as it were?  Do you ever step outside with your co-workers, but not smoke?  Try to find a quiet (haha) spot for a couple minutes as somebody watches your section?

I was actually pretty good about lasting through my shift, but by the time my last table was gone I used to smoke two in a row.  Now that I'm an ex-smoker, I'm not sure how to get my head right after a hard night.

225 days!

Well it has been a haul. I have gained a total of 20 pounds. Last year I went on a journey to recreate myself. I lost 55 pounds and quit smoking. 

Now I gained weight back but am (probably) not addicted to cigarettes anymore. Honestly I am not sure what Id rather have... the addiction or the weight. I was starting to look good and feel good about myself.

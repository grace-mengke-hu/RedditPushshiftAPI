6 weeks and i feel great

i've been getting in shape, eating healthier, sleeping wonderfully, and best of all not craving cigarettes. i get the occasional craving, but yesterday i went a whole day without even thinking about smoking. in fact i got a notifaction from my quit smoking app asking me if i forgot to check in. Its a great feeling to be free from such a deadly, terrible thing. Hang in there everyone, it only gets better!

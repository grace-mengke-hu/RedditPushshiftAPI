3 Months! Vaping questions

After smoking for 5 years I decided that it was time to get rid of it before it really turned into a problem. I quit cold turkey and did pretty well with it, but I've found the cravings are a lot stronger lately than they were when i first quit. I've ordered a vaporizer with e-liquid(zero nicotine) on the internet because i enjoyed that act of smoking, not so much cigarettes themselves. Have any of you switched to vaping or started vaping?

This week is my first year smoke free!

It's definitely been the most difficult thing I have ever went through in my 30 something years of existence. It's amazing how something so easy to start, can be so difficult to stop doing.

But let me tell you, if I can do it - YOU can as well! The first month I felt so miserable and really didn't think I was able to go through with it, but with the help of family and friends and posts I've seen on Reddit I was able to push through. I feel so much more alive now, not always coughing, or tired, or smell bad. I just wish I had quit sooner. However, it's better late than never!

So for anybody else going through this journey and think you can't continue... you can! :)

Here's a picture of me a year after quitting, looking much more healthier than ever before.

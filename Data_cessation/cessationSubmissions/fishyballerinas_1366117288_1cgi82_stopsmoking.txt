Panic Attacks

Hey Everyone.

I've got 42 days and have noticed that I'm having some intense panic attacks. Like, all day can't stop my brain panic attacks. I used to get them while I smoked, but would just smoke through them. 

It's been like this off and on for a week and a half now and I'm getting a little worried I'm going to completely fail. I don't know if it is just my brain trying to get me to smoke or if I'm totally losing it.

Has any one else just been in panic mode and if so have any help?

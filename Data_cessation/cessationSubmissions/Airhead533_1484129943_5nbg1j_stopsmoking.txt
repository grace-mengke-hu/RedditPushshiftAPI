I've just finished the book and I'm going for my final cigarette.

I've been trying to quit with not much success these last few months. I read the Allen Car book and have the next 5 days off from work so that no stresses or situation things can set me off. I actually feel confident saying that I'm now a non-smoker instead of the usual " I'm trying to quit." I know that I'm paying a fortune 500 company to kill me sooner and make me essentially chemically  imbalanced. I'm ready to find out the potential of my body before my prime has passed and I know I can't do it while I am a smoker.  I've had it with being lethargic and chain smoking before bed and sleeping for 10 hours each night. I've had enough of the smokers cough I have developed and I'm tired of the constant throat clearing. I know that my family wants me to quit and they worry about me, but fuck them. I'm doing this for my self and nobody else. I don't want to die prematurely and lay in my death bed saying what if. Sorry for the rant but the book has me all worked up haha.

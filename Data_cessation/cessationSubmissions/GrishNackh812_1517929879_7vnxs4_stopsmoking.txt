Why can't I stop smoking?

Is it like my friend says and I have no will power? I mean, it has to be. I live in a house with two other smokers that do not seem to care that I want to quit, and keep giving me cigs and buying them even when I say I want to quit. I've tried vaping, and still smoke. Patches and still smoke. Pills and still smoke. The amount I smoke is starting to scare me, and I just want to quit, but I can't. Help!!!!

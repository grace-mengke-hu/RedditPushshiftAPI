30 days today

Just realized I reached the 30 day mark of no cigarettes. I still occasionally pop a piece of nicorette as needed but I made it. Now the next step...to break the nicotine habit for good. 

What a difference. I can smell things, taste things, I dont stink like stale smoke anymore. Its been a very good month.

I didn’t smoke for 2 weeks, but

Hi guys! I’ve smoked for 5 years. in November I seriously decided to quit smoking. I made some attempts before, but every time I came back to cigarettes. Actually I didn’t smoke for 2 weeks. And I was so proud myself. I thought that the most difficult it’s not to smoke first 3 days, but I was wrong. And yesterday I smoked 1 cigarette. It was so pleasant to smoke again. But then I started to blame myself. And now I want to smoke very much. Don’t know how to be stronger and not to start smoke again(

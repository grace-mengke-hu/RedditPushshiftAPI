Failed at 1 month, starting again

I made it to one month, finally, after countless failed attempts. I was so proud and was telling everybody about the direct correlation between not smoking and my happiness/mental health. 

The day that I hit 1 month was also the day that my two best friends began to break up. They hadn't spoken for days and were horribly upset, so I suggested we buy a packet of cigarettes to share, because we always used to chat about life while we chain-smoked. I thought I was helping by getting them to talk and share their feelings with each other and me, but I was just using them as a scapegoat to justify my dirty addiction.

The breakup continued, and so did the smoking. Three weeks later and I'm back to 10+ a day. What an idiot. It sucks to have to start again, but today is day 1, and writing it here solidifies it just a little more. I'll get out of bed as soon as I post this and start my new life as a non-smoker.

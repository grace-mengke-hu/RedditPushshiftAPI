Vivid dreams

Hi everyone,

I'm on day 4 now. It's going ok, but I have these vivid dreams. I usually have nightmares (even before stopping, I'm a worrier so I guess that's why), but they don't really bother me because I can just shake them off when I wake up. However, nowadays the dreams are so lively they stick with me throughout the day.


Will this stop? Did you guys have the same experience?

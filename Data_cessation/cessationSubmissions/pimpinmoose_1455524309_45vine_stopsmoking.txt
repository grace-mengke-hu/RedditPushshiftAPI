Craving hard and need support from you

Hello guys, I have done nothing but my best friend stopped talking to me all of a sudden and is hanging around with people who hate me. I feel really alone and hopeless right now and I feel like a cigarette could make things better, it's my 6th day but I really need a reason to not light up a cig right now.

Can't concentrate to lessons because I'm having a fight in my head. It's literally the good and the bad inside me fighting and I don't know what to think to support the good side. I don't want to go back to smoking but goddamn am I craving hard

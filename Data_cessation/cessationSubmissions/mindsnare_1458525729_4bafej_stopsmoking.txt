I've never been a heavy smoker. But I'm still struggling.

I haven't smoked for just under a week now. And the cravings haven't really waned at all. During the week I use to have one cigarette in the morning, one when I got home from work, and maybe 1 or 2 more before bed. If I'm out with friends drinking, I'll have about 6 more on a solid night, on a real big night, 15 or so, entirely depends on who I'm hanging out with. 

I'm pretty convinced that as soon as I have a bunch of beers with some mates, I'm going to smoke, problem is I bloody enjoy it, I love heading outside with some mates and shooting the shit with a beer and a smoke where it's a little quieter. 

Anyone else in a similar position?

Do cigarettes hold a special place in anyone's heart?

I've officially stopped smoking; it's different this time.  I picked a stop date.  I've been mentally preparing myself for a month.  I've told my friends.  I'm mentally prepared to kick an addiction, but I do it with a bit of sadness.

Tons of my family members have been hurt or killed by smoking.  I was always the person who would never touch a cigarette.  That was until I became really depressed.  I was living along in a foreign country where the only person I knew was my recently ex-girlfriend.  The whole situation destroyed me and I was just in a really dark place; borderline suicidal.

I became really reckless.  Anything that would give me a rush was better than being numb constantly.  This is when I picked up cigarettes and, honestly, it was exactly what I needed.  It gave me a reason to get up in the morning and trudge through the snow.  It gave me a motivation to walk outside and go to class.  It gave me the courage to go to social events since I could sneak out when the social anxiety became too much and take a smoke break.  It wasn't just something that I did, it was something that I needed; I feel like it saved me in a way.

Even after I got back home and became mentally well, cigarettes still stuck around and created memories with me.  I've met so many cool people while enjoying a cig.  I met my ex-girlfriend and some of my best memories of her and I are sitting outside on a winter's day cuddled up and sharing a smoke.  I feel like my relationship with my sister has improved since I can join her on her extended smoke breaks and talk about life.  I swear at least half of my "Eureka!" moments in college was during a smoke break.

Does anyone else feel like they're kinda leaving a friend behind by quitting?  How do you deal with it?

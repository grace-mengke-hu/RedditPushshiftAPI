Does using an ecig count?

I've been wanting to quit for a long time. I normally smoke American Spirits, and I can feel the difference in my body if I smoked something like a camel. I have some Blue ecig stuff, and the QuitSM android app as a widget to help me visualize my progress. However, if I'm using an ecig, does that still count towards quitting?

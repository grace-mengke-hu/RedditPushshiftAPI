Day 4

OK, i have just found this community.  Ive been smoking for more than 20 years, started vaping a year back.  Spent 2 weeks on 0mg juice and now im off everything.  I have terrible headaches, a tightness in my chest and my work collegues are giving me weird looks as i sigh and breath very deeply.  my concentration is screwed and i cant sleep...... just needed to say that.  The  cravings come in very intense waves but if i can ride them out im good for another half an hour

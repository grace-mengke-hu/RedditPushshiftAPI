Kinda like leaving an abusive lover...first post please be nice..

Quitting You

Present during my conception, present during my birth.
You have been around my whole life, but what has it been worth?

Our bond started in secret, I knew what we were doing was wrong.
With you, I felt some confidence, feelings that had been long gone.

Trying to prove myself as a rebel, I'd sneak you into my room at night.
You would help soothe my mind and comfort me with your soft light.

You have been a huge influence on how I function in his life.
But defending our relationship, has resulted in some strife.

So many years we have had, sitting side by side.
How has my commitment to you so instantly died?

Maybe it's truly time, for me to start to see,
The real intentions you have, and how they are ruining me.

You have turned me black inside, and have only slowed me down.
It's become harder to breathe, I have aged so quickly now.

I need to leave you behind, I need to become free.
I will no longer be subject, to the hold you have on me.

Today is the day that I will finally say goodbye, 
It almost hurts enough to make me cry.

I have the vision of a healthier life in sight.
I don't need you anymore, Parliament Menthol Light...

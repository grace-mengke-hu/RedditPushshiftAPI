Question about being a passive smoker

Hi /r/stopsmoking, good day everyone, non-smoker here.

I really hope I'm not infringing any rule in this subreddit, but I couldn't find any better place to ask this:

I just came here to ask how bad is actually being a passive smoker, I'm actively taking care of myself and I'll be living the next few months with a chain-smoker (smokes all day long). I'm concerned about my lungs and overall well-being.

I don't like tobacco AT ALL, but I can stand it, I mean, the real reason that worries me is the damage I could be doing to myself by passive-smoking.

How worried should I really be? should I stay away of him while he smokes (which is all day long really)? is it that detrimental to my lungs?

Apologies if this is not an appropriate subreddit to ask such thing, I'd love if you guys point me out to a more appropriate place.

I thank you in advance for the help.

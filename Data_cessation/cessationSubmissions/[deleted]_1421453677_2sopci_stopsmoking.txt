Today is the day.

I have smoked weed daily for nine years. Non-stop, if I am not at work, I am high. Sometimes when I am at work I am high. I used to sneak in the closet at work on Saturdays (only one who worked the shift) to smoke. I would be stoned all day. The past few years has been a blur, its hard remembering things that happened to me a few days or even hours ago. Its not a money thing...not this time...this time I want to quit, I really do. I will quit. I won't take no for an answer. I won't create ways out, I wont try to escape what I know will be beneficial to me so much. The plus is, the best part of this, is the excitement of being able to live life sober. All I have wanted to do but didn't because I am high. Or last minute flaked on friends cause I'd rather get high and play guitar or listen to music. I know I need this for myself. But I will need as much encouragement as I can get, I'll be updating and checking here when I have an urge. Cheers everyone!

How I successfully quit smoking. (feel free to ask for advice)

Thought I'd share my strategy in hopes some of you might do the same and rid yourselves of such a horrible addiction that may be impacting your life more than you think; psychologically, physically and economically. It's been around a year since I've lit up a cig and to be honest I have no urge to pick one up at all.

I think this strategy should be pretty universal, although keep in mind that the safety blanket that our mind rushes to in fear of quitting smoking (due to addiction) is very personal. We may tell ourselves ''but it gives me an excuse for a break at work'', ''it calms me down'', ''it makes me look sleek'', and many more that ultimately are thoughts that are used to manipulate ourselves to believe it is better to smoke than not. Think about the money you're saving, that you can spend on things that last and have a larger impact on your happiness and well-being. Or how you will be able to face your issues with calmness and confidence, going straight for the bullseye, rather than retracting for a dose of synthetic bliss.

My strategy was as follows (I do suggest you do your own research about the below topics too btw) : 

At silly as it sounds, what I did was buy a vape, which was my gateway to the end of the tunnel. Not expensive, just an entry-level, which will take the oil that I pick. Regarding the flavor, I went for tobacco to make the craving and withdrawal easier. (VAPE AND OIL WILL BE LISTED BELOW)

&amp;#x200B;

The IMPORTANT thing to note is that I went for the NICOTINE oil, which made me get the kick that I got from cigarettes. I personally went for the 6mg nictone level oil first, as that is the strength that through my research levelled with the strength of a bit less than a cigarette.  The first few puffs were weird and the taste was like a candle compared to a cig, but after a ONE DAY of using it instead of cigs, I already got used to the taste.

&amp;#x200B;

After this tiny bottle of oil finished (within 2 weeks), I bought one of 3mg, and another of 0mg (different flavor), which frankly tasted like dog ass. This was my brain's first attempt to relapse, but the second I bummed a cig and lit it up, the taste of a normal cigarette was so disgusting, like taking a cigarette for the first time, that I threw it in an ashtray and was done with smoking for good. I did still have a few more puffs off the vape here and there, but since even that tasted like dogshit (not as bad as a normal cig), then I gave that up too. 

&amp;#x200B;

Within around 5 weeks of buying the vape I was off smoking for good and I haven't lit one since, or even used the vape.

VAPE : Innokin EZ WATT Starter Kit (around $30)

OIL : Tobacco by Elements (6mg) 

&amp;#x200B;

IMPORTANT : Keep in mind, vapes are not 100% risk free, and from my research I'd say it is still a grey area, although CIGARETTES ARE 100% CONFIRMED TO BE BAD, so I think it's definitely worth it, without any doubt in my mind.

[HELP] Struggling not to relapse

It sounds weird to say 'relapse'. I've always assumed it takes a few years of quitting before you can say you 'relapsed' but either way... 

I've been tobacco free for 27 days now, and it hasn't gotten any easier. I have cravings daily, and it's a process, man! 


I've spent the last period in a rehabilitation center to recover from using other drugs, so I've taken it as an opportunity to quit smoking as well. Now I'm at a point in my recovery where I can go back home to stay for a day or two. Today is one of those days, and it's really difficult not to think about it here since my room is where I always smoked. Really just needed to vent.

Unexpected side effects of quitting

Hey r/stopsmoking! I'm about 3 days shy of 2 weeks without a cigarette. This is the longest I've gone without in almost 8 years and I feel FANTASTIC! No crazy cravings anymore, my lungs feel strong, I can smell and taste things  I haven't in years. Best decision I've ever made (and I LOVED smoking).

There is one side effect I wasn't expecting though. As I have become acutely aware, nicotine is a diuretic, and after almost a decade, my body has adapted accordingly. Without the nicotine... well let's just say I've been drinking a lot of coffee and eating a lot of broccoli. How long will it be before my system gets back to normal?

Widow gets her quit back

I'm 31, 3 little kids and my husband passed away last October. In my grief I stupidly started smoking again after nearly 3 years of being quit. My husband was so proud of me for quitting, he would have wanted me to stay quit.

So.. I'm quitting. I am 16 hours in, I have to do this and I will. I am here to declare my intentions and make the commitment. For my kids and for myself. We got this, reddit, let's do it! I'll be updating here through the first week. 

-----------------------

Update #1: 28 hours baby, yeah!! I love all of you so much right now. This is a labor of love. I know if I can get a week.  I am going to stay quit. Still going strong!

----------------------------

Update #2:  2 days down, still some free and not going back! Let's go for day three guys, we got this!!

---------------------------

Update #3: 3 days in the bag!! Feeling amazing and so grateful, this is really happening!

-------------------------

Update #4: 4 days still feeling pretty good, tired a lot. I chalk it up to my body healing. <3

------------------------

Update #5: on day 5, it's amazing how much better I feel physically and mentally, I feel as though an immense weight has been lifted off of me and the fog has dispersed leaving my eyes wide open to welcome the beautiful new day ahead of me.

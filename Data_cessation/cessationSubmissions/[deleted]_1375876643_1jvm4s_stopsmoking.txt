Just reset my badge :(

My badge said 11 days smoke-free but I've just had to have it reset. I was so desperate I dug around in the rubbish at work and found a pack with 3 left inside, so I smoked the lot. 

Again, feeling nothing but regret about this. I don't feel calmer - in fact I feel worse. I feel a bit queasy and there's that familiar, lingering taste in my mouth I no longer enjoy.

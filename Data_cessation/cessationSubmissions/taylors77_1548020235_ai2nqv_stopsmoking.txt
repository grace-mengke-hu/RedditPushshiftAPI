Resting heart rate down after not smoking since 12/30.

I wear a Fitbit and track my resting heart rate. Before this I was regularly smoking and drinking, but working out pretty consistently. I quit smoking and drinking three weeks ago and I was wondering if anyone else has noticed their resting heart rate go down after quitting? I’m curious to know whether it can be attributed more to the alcohol or cigarettes. 

Either way this community is one of the biggest reasons I finally quit and y’all have the best advice!

Chantix and Weight Gain (x-post from r/loseit)

just goes to show that a little independent research can make all of the difference in the world. i quit smoking last month and went onto chantix. i'd been doing pretty good on my weight loss over the past year - 255 to 215 - and decided to finally bite the bullet and give myfitnesspal a try - total eye opener on my calories by the way, when i found out that i was packing in 1500 calories in "healthy" snacks every day on top of meals.

but frankly, i didn't think it was working. i met all of my calorie and nutrition goals every day and it would tell me you should be (x) weight in 5 weeks. and instead i was hovering around the same 3lb loss / gain. i'd drop to 212 one day and back up to 215 the next for the past 4 weeks.

i knew weight gain was a side effect for chantix, but didn't realize the extent until i started browsing around forums and finding people - eating healthy even - packing on 30-60 lbs in a month. apparently my healthy eating / no loss that was frustrating me was actually keeping me level and keeping me from some serious weight gain.

i know that a lot of people quit smoking and start eating better and working out all around the same time, so just a little bit of "don't freak out if it doesn't seem to be working" advice from me to you. that is all. back to your lives, people.

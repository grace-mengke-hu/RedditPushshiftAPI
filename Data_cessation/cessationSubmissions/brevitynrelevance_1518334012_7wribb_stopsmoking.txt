Went drinking and didn’t smoke!

When I quit smoking I also gave up drinking to help me be more successful. I’m not a frequent drinker but when I go out I’ll have about 5 drinks over the course of a night. 

The club was really smoky and people were lighting up constantly all around me. I breathed it in and thought I could bum one, or I could not. I was grossed out by the smell of my clothes when I left but the whole time I thought “that’s not me anymore.” 

Celebrating my success and happy to prove to myself that even when I drink, I don’t have to smoke!

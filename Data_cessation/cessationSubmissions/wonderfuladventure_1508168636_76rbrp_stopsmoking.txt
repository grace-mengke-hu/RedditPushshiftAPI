help with post smoking symptoms

not sure if I am just sick or if it's affected by not smoking?

Smoker of 7 years, quit once 3 years ago for 3-4 months but went through a bad breakup and pretty much became a chain smoker.

Now I'm 12 days into my genuine quit. First few days I felt great; had more energy, everything tasted wonderful and generally I had more time on my hands.

I came off nicotine patches 6 days ago and these past 6 days have been awful. Low energy/mood, got a bad cough building up in the back of my throat, a lot of moodswings.

Am I unwell or is this because of the nicotine withdrawal?

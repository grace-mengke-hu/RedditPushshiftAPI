Chantix? Does it work?

I really really need to stop smoking. The longest I've ever been able to go without smoking is a little under a month, but I'm always surrounded by smokers and fall back into it after a drink or two. I've been smoking for 9 years this July and really would like to quit for good. I've heard all the standard tips (you have to WANT to stop, etc.), and I've tried the patches/gum and I always just remove them. Has Chantix worked for anyone? Is it expensive? Any other helpful tips are encouraged. Thanks!

Omg, the sweating

I am rounding day 3, and using a really low amount of nrt.   Last night I kept waking up drenched in sweat.  I don't remember that happening last time I quit?  I don't have a lot of energy and my sinuses are clearing like crazy.  I know it's withdrawal, and it's manageable.  I don't even want to smoke!  I feel like I've had that click again of turning the corner.  Now, just to never try a cig again.  No testing the universe!  Hope everyone is hanging in!

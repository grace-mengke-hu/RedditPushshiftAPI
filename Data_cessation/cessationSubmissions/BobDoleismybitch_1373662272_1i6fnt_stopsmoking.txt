Got drunk and bought a pack, but I'm still hopeful.

I got to 2 days without smoking, but when I got promoted (in the military) I decided to celebrate and ended up smoking. I think I've figured out that my biggest problem isn't the physical side of it but the mental habit of smoking. This entire week I've been forcing myself to go at least 2 hours before I can smoke. Although this is not ideal, I feel that over time I will make my habit less and less frequent until I quit all together. The biggest thing that this process is doing is making me say no to offers at work to go out for a smoke break, that's probably the biggest reason for my failure to quit. Next week I will only smoke once every 4 hours and so on and so forth until the habit is dead. Thoughts?

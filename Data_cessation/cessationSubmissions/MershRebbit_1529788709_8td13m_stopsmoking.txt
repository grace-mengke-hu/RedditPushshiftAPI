I’m having a weak moment. I’m sure it’s the first of many.

Hi all.  I inadvertently quit smoking a day and a half ago.  I stayed up way too late and smoked more than normal.  I woke up yesterday feeling like crap.  So I didn’t smoke all day.  It rained all day yesterday and I left my smokes outside so they got trashed.  I haven’t bought any since.  But I just ate and I’m having a really tough time.  I tried quitting back in January and made it about six week, having had a couple of smokes in that time.  

I know I’m not the first one to ask for some encouragement, but I’m going out tonight and it will be even more tempting after a couple of drinks.  Thanks for listening!

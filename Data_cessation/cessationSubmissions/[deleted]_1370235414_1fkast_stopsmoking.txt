best non-cold turkey ways to quit?

so I've tried cold turkey 4-5 times now. I don't have any urges at all when I'm sober but when I'm drunk I feel like I need a cigarette. I've gone up to 2 weeks without smoking at all but then I get drunk and go to the bar with my friends and end up smoking. None of my friends smoke either I'll either find some random person who gives one to me or I'll buy a pack. any suggestions?

62 hours and going!

i have tried to quit many times earlier but always had relapse after 2 days or so.. to all who have recently quit, my advice would be not to think about it. more you think, more the cravings.. breathe fresh for your remaining life !! and this subreddit is great.. great energy and motivation from fellow redditors..

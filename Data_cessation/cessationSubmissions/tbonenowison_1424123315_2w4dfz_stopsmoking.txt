It's so strange what tobacco makes you think/act

The upcoming weeks until today I've been struggling with the addiction.. quit for a week, have just '1', smoke for a week, etc.. over and over again. 

I know deep down I want to rid this beast. I've done it before cold turkey. I lasted 2 years smoke free until I had my heart broken by a girl (the first cig after 2 years clean felt soooo wrong but I convinced myself otherwise). I always remind myself how those were the best 2 years of my life because they genuinely were. Exercising, surfing twice a day, eating healthy, being responsible. I can't believe I still surf while smoking, do I seriously want to increase my chances of drowning?

Fast forward 4 years later to this present moment, and now it's finally time to defeat this monster. Lately, I've been embarrassed by smoking like how I smell in public, but I'll always seem to spark another one up anyways. Who cares right? I can quit whenever I want. (LAME) I sometimes carry a dryer sheet with me to rub on my clothes, as well as using aftershave to smell good. I want to be into exercising with full energy again, but I always figure one more smoke won't hurt anybody, especially myself.

I'm tired of feeling weak, and deep down I know the truth is making up lame excuses because of fear.

Not today, not anymore. I'm fighting one of the biggest challenges I'll ever face in my life and I need to prove to myself that it can be done, that I can live my life exactly how I want without being tied down. Life only gets better from now on.

(I really needed to type and get this off but I wish everyone luck!)

Day 24, anxiety, anger, and depression worst so far

Heavy dipper for 10+ years.  Since I’ve quit I’ve dealt with some rough stuff in life that a good dip would help me through ;  loss of pet, best friend at work getting fired, car breakdown. 


The first 2 weeks I just felt tired and hungry all the time.  Now I’m extremely anxious, angry, bad heartburn, and dealing with some depression.  When does it end?

Sorry guys I took a cigg...

Im feeling so bad. I just took another cigg. I told myself I Will never do it again. But my heart is breaking from a girl I love. She Loved me before, when I didnt like her. Now im in love with her, but she doesnt want me anymore after I bronze her heart. I am crying, and I could not do it so I took one of these bastard ciggaretes. Please help me. Im so depressed. What should I do.

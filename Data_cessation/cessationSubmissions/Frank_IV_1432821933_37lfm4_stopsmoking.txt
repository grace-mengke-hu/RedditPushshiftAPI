Back to square one. Again

Hiya, long time lurker first time poster! So I have a bit of a 'pattern' and it makes me sad/annoyed with myself. 

Basically this; I read Alan Carr's book nearly two years ago, and it worked wonders. But a few months in I started cheating, often with alcohol, and it was so rare in the beginning but started increasing over time. One cigarette per month turned into one every weekend, etc. 

Six months in I was smoking most weekends and evenings, and hated myself for it. This continued for several weeks until I decided enough was enough, and quit again. 

This was last September, and I didn't touch a cigarette for 3-4 months again, however, slowly they started creeping back, just a puff here and there, perhaps only once a month. And now, May 2015 I'm back to smoking most evenings and weekends again (it's only been a couple of weeks). 

Before this period, I had similar on and off jolts with nicotine gum for about a year. I recognise the patterns of when I start to slip, it's often after a drink or two - and the problem is my SO smokes so tobacco is always available. 

I plan to quit again this Sunday but am also getting quite down about the fact that I might fail again six months later. I know I shouldn't smoke AT ALL, and I know it's my fault for slipping, but just wanted to see if you had similar experiences? Most stories I see online people give up for life after Alan Carr's book.

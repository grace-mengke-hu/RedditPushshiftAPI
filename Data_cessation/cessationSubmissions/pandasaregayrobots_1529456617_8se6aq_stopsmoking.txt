I quietly passed 1 year and I am flabbergasted.

Never thought I could say it's been one year since having a cigarette. It's a great feeling! I have the sense of smell of a dog, and love having all the extra income. I long ago uninstalled my stopsmoking app, but it helped immensely in the first few months. Now, I almost forget I ever smoked at all. I never liked the smell of it even when I was smoking, so I was never tempted by smelling the smoke, more disgusted. The only thing that ever got to me in the beginning was watching someone enjoy a cigarette, but now I can look at them with pity, because I know it's just a temporary enjoyment.


If I could give anyone advice it would be to distract yourself, deter the urges (maybe tell yourself I'll have one at the end of the day, but by that time your craving has pasted), and just keep reminding yourself that cigarettes are shitty stupid little things and you are a strong, amazing person and you are so so much stronger than that stupid cigarette. 


Here's to another year!

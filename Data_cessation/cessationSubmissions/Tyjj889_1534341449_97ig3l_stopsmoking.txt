How to combat thoughts of smoking?

I keep getting these damn thoughts of,"Well I made it this far, might as well smoke a cig" or "Just a cig won't hurt, you got all the time in the world to quit, why quit now?". This is starting to get super annoying, I'm just on day three but it almost feels like torture saying no.. The thoughts are very intense for a few seconds and then they subside.. Only thing that keeps me from lighting a cig is knowing I will feel like shit for smoking one right after the nicotine rush. Like woooo got a little head rush and I get to restart the withdraw process again weeeeeeeeee... I need to stay quit.. will keep you guys posted if I relapse lol

Been on the nicoderm patch for over a month and only now i'm starting to get a weird side-effect

I've been on the Nicoderm patch for just over a month(Step 3, 7mg/day) and didnt really have any side effects up until now. I picked up my 5th prescription last thursday and ever since I been experiencing increased heart-rate for the fist 30-90mins after applying the patch, I even almos threw up the other day.

Is it possible that the prescription I got was a bad/stronger batch? Is my body just reacting differently now since i've gotten used to not intaking nicotine?

Thanks

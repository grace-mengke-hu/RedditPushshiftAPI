Quit just before Christmas, any idea how long my smoker's cough will linger for?

Or if it will stick around for a long time?

Obviously it's a lot less bad than it was when I was smoking a pack a day, but despite quitting cold turkey, I'm still hacking up phlegm on a morning. Not a huge amount, but enough to be annoying.

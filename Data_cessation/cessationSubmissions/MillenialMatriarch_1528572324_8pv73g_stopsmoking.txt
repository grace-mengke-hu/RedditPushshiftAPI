Anhedonia anyone?

Anhedonia as in the lack of pleasure in normally pleasurable activity?

  I'm about 2.5 wks, and nothing seems exciting or enjoyable even. Feels somewhat like a depressive episode, but maybe a little worse due to the tantrum like expressions on my end almost daily for the past three days. Also really low energy.

  This may very well have nothing to Do with quitting or may be compounded by good old fashioned lack of sleep. Either way, I feel slightly insane the past couple days. 

  Anyone willing to tell me this gets better? Tips for coping when you've used cigarettes to cope for your whole adulthood?

Starting on October 21

I took a day off work, pre ordered battlefield 1, told my so that I'm going to be a fickle bitch and plan to be in a smoke free bunker for the first three days.  Pack a day for about 8 years and I am legitimately excited. All I'm looking for is some advice for Monday. Smoke breaks are sacred for me at work and I need a replacement.

How I quit and will remain a Non-Smoker!

I decided that 10-1-18 would be my quit date...

I woke up that morning and I was pissed off! I was agitated... I was angry... I was resentful. I like smoking! But I was also sick and tired of feeling sick and tired! 

So you know what I did??? … I had four cigarettes left so I went outside grabbed a cup of coffee and chain-smoked all four of them! 

Then I opened up my Smoke Free app and entered October 1 at 10 AM as my quit date!  

I used the patch for the first 10 days. That helped me a LOT as well. I would take it off around 6:00 pm (to give myself a nicotine free sleep....plus who smokes while they sleep!?) 

Highly recommend that you download the “Smoke Free” app. It’s white background with a green heart icon. 

I cannot tell you how helpful that app has been!  I am watching in the app that my health is getting better and better every day!!!!  And I am actually now regaining “life days“!    

I’m feeling really great! I don’t feel ashamed any more and the self loathing has ended!   I am even planning some more “active” type things to do like snow skiing and hiking. Things I knew I was not healthy enough to do before. (Got too winded) 

KEY:  When I have cravings I journal them in the app! That would be my one encouragement to you or anybody is using this app… Journal your cravings! Because this way now I see a report of what my triggers are and I can more easily avoid them!

The other thing I love (!!!) is that I am now... and can legitimately call myself a “non-smoker“. 

Finally, I learned “diaphragmatic breathing”. That really helped me!!! When I get cravings I breathe. Here is a good video for that. https://www.pnmedical.com/lessons/diaphragmatic-breathing-technique/

You’ve got this!!!!  

P.S. my app challenge was to connect to this site and tell people I am a non smoker!  So one more thing accomplished. Yippee.  Hope my story helps some one! ❤️

I accidentally discovered a really good way to make my car not smell like cigarettes.

I left a half drunk Monster Energy drink in my cupholder the other day. It was about 90Â° all day so when I got back in my car I got smacked in the face by the smell of hot energy drink, but it didn't smell like cigarettes at all. After a few days the energy drinks smell went away and took the cigarette smell with it. 

It's only weird if it doesn't work right?

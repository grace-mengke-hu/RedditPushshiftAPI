I did it!

I quit cold turkey, 3 days ago. I finally went to see a doctor to tell them I was ready and get medications, I was prescribed Zyban. But my medical refused to cover it and the pharmacy refuses to let me pick it up, so I just quit cold turkey. This weekend was insane, but I woke up today with the worst migraine I've felt in years and took some Bayer Migraine medicine and I feel so much better. On top of getting rid of the headache, I feel like the cravings are much more controllable. I'm on Day 3 and I hope I never go back. :)

I'm just here to gloat. Nic-free since August 2013

I smoked 0.5-1.5 packs every day for 13 years, quit cold turkey in August. Was sick for 2 or 3 days and it just seemed like a good idea to stop smoking, so I stopped. I've tried before and never made it more than 3 days. This time it just clicked, I don't smoke anymore. Thinking of myself as a nonsmoker first and foremost helped a ton.

Anyway, I'm glad I made it for good. Like in the essay on quitting that David Sedaris wrote "I'm finished smoking".

Quitting after 12 years.

Hello fellas. I'm 26, started smoking with 14. 

I had everything. Half pack a day, pack a day, two packs a day - and for one year even 3-4 a day. ( 20 in a pack, EU, if that matters to anyone )  

Now I'm back to two packs a day - until now. Had my last cigarette ( which I strongly plan it to be ) before I went to sleep - this day none so far &amp; it's killing me, but that was expected. 

&amp;nbsp;

I was wondering if you could prepare me for the next two weeks? 

- What symptoms can I expect.
- What to do against the hunger.
- When is the "initial hard" part over.
- Should I find another addiction ( healthy one ) to compromise? 

Share with me everything that helped you and inspire me to be like you! 

Googling really gave me only generic answers and I'd like to hear some from you.

Kind regards,

Ben.

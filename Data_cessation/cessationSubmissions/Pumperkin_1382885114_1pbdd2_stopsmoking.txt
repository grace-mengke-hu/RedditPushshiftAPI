It's my quit day! Again!

The year I met my wife (2001), I worked at a summer camp.  We weren't allowed to smoke near the patrons (children), so I in effect quit for 5 entire days.  Every week.  For 3 months.  Every Friday, I would start up again until Sunday morning.  If I could meet this past version of myself, I would kick his ass.  Since then, I have not stopped in succession for an equal length of time.  Today is different.  Today is the day I begin my climb past that 6 day milestone, then keep going and never look back.  Today I am emancipated!

Guide me .

So I've been smoke-free for 10 days now and surprisingly I didn't have even the slightest of discomfort until now . Today I'd a really intense urge to smoke .I don't know if I can explain but It's like I'm losing focus now.The intensity of hatred I'd for cigarettes and my motive for quitting them seems to be fading away slowly and slowly. What should I do ? How do I get in the same mind-frame I was in when I wanted to quit and I loathed cigarettes.

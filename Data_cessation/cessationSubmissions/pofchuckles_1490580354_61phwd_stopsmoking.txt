Money I have saved and the app I use

When it got to September my quit smoking app told me I had saved $1,000 (ish) Canadian dollars so I got myself a car. It now tells me I have saved $3,430.35 dollars. I'm flying back home to the UK for a month and then I fly to Brisbane with money to activate my AUS visa. Get the app Drop It if your struggling and you will be amazed at how much money you save + other things. One of my friends quit on Jan 10th and on jan 11th I told him to get this appl and now he hasn't smoked since either. I Smoked for 9 years. I failed a lot of times and then didn't try to quit for 3 years. I decided to give it another go I got this app and job done.

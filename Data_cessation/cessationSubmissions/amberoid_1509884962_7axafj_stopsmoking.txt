How do i cope with the pub?

I like going to the pub, I've thought about quitting it for a few months but I get quite lonely at home.

I'm on the patch but every time I go to the pub I smoke, so I'm just having the occasional one.  The patch means I don't need cigarettes when I'm not at the pub.

It was hard for the first few weeks or months getting over not smoking at home or at work etc but now I hardly even think of it in most places.  It's just the pub that is hard.

Should I battle through the cravings at the pub like I did with home and work and other places?  Our should I stop going to the pub?  Or should I just carry on with the "social smoking"?

I understand that I will annoy a lot of people because I have not really quit.  But I've been trying for over a year now.  

Also please ignore any badge I may be showing, it's inaccurate.  I'll try to remove it now.

Thanks in advance

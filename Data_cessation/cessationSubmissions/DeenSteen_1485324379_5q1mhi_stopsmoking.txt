Kind of having an issue with quitting.

Hey y'all, first post here. So I quit smoking cigs entirely (and moved to an e-cigarette) on December 14th, 2016. If someone could update my flair or remind me how to do it myself, that'd be dope.

Anyway, so quitting has been great. I have noticed my senses of smell and taste coming back to me, no one smells tobacco on me anymore, I feel healthier, etc.

HOWEVER, since I quit, for the first 2 weeks or so, the cravings were present but not too bad. Since then, they've been getting a lot worse. I've been clean over a month and every day that goes by I am tempted to pick up a pack more and more.

Just for background info, I had been a one or two cigs per day smoker for a year or two and a quarter pack a day smoker for the year prior to me quitting. I'm young and surrounded by drunk people smoking constantly, and while I still love the smell (always have, since I was a child, and probably always will) and crave them more when I smell someone smoking one, I tend to crave them when I'm alone or working or studying, as I used to use them to help me focus on my work. I can vape, but in my county they just upped the age to buy e-juices to 21 (WTF, right?), so I have to travel out-of-county (30-40 minute drive) to acquire e-liquid for my vape, and I am currently out of liquid and won't be able to get more for at least another few days.

Any suggestions or words of wisdom? Thanks.

Trying to quit.. again

7 years of smoking cigarettes.. up to a pack every 4-5 days and sick of thinking about the damage I'm doing to myself. Bought a vape to help me ween off and I have about 8 cigarettes left. 

It feels like yesterday when I told myself I wouldn't get addicted, but here I am. How did you guys do it?

Got an email from myself 50 days ago

*What up, future me!*

*Just wanted to say well done on reaching a major milestone, as of today you have officially been a non-smoker for 50 days! Give yourself a big high five!*

*Kind Regards,*

*Past you*

I'd already forgotten sending it, but I recall I sent emails to myself to arrive on key milestones so that I could encourage my future self along the way up until my first year milestone. Thanks past me, being a bro to future and present me :P

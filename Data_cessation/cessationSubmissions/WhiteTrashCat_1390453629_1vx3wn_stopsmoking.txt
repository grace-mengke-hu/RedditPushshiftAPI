Anyone have any suggestions for any good apps to track your progress?

I am looking for any type of help and support to quit. There are so many different apps so I was just wondering if anyone had a favorite. Thanks. Good luck and congratulations on your progress so far even if it is just checking this sub or reading about quitting.  It takes a lot of courage to think about changing a lifestyle.

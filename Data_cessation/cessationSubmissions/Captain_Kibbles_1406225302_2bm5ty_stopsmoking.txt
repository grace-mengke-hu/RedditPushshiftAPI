I don't need them

I had a really rough start to my summer starting a new job and dealing with a breakup, but I want to thank you all so much for helping me make this great decision.

I've been cutting back the last few weeks and now I'm on day 4 without a cigarette.  I've recently become a lot more optimistic about life and I think that quitting has had a big part in changing my mood.  I used to feel like I needed the cig to make myself feel better but you all have helped me understand that not true, so thank you all.

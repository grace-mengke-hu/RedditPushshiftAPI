WTF do you do with all this excess energy!?

I feel like I'm losing it!  I work out almost every day now (this new hobby started at the beginning of the year) and that already has boosted my energy level.  But now, with smoking, I'm an absolute mess.  I'm already pretty fidgety and restless so gong even half a day without a cigarette is torture.

Mentally I feel ready.  Ready to push past the craving...  But god damn all this energy is going to ruin me.  It's all angry energy too and it's easy to avoid on the weekends when I'm alone and just go for a walk but I don't know how I'm going to make it through a work week.  I also don't want to replace the physical motions of smoking with snacking... But just mentally preparing myself for the day has me stress eating AND smoking.

Ahhhhhhhhh. /rant

Thanks :)

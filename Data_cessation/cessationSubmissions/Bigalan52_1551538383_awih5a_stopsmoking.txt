For those of you using patches

After reading Allen Carr and trying cold turkey several times I could not get past 3 to 4 days 


This is the second time I’ve used patches. Started with 21mg for 3 weeks then 14 mg for 5 weeks then 7 mg for 2 1/2 weeks. I am now into week 12 this is the 4th day without  patches which wasn’t planned I just forgot to put one on the other day and today I feel great 

I am 53 this year and feel better than I have for umpteen years 

If I can get through this you all can 

I will not smoke with you today

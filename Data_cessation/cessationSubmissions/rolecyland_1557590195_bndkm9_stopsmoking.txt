De-Fuckulating

Yesterday I took my Novo &amp; cut it up with some garden shears - felt kinda good. 

Day 1 has been alright, especially considering how difficult of a day it was. Learning harsh but necessary lessons is a tough feat, and this was just another one of them. Going into an eight hour shift today as a line cook/dishwasher, hoping Iâ€™m not too adversely affected by the many smokers around me &amp; the work that warrants it.

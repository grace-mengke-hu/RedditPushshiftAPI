Gum health seems to have deteriorated since quitting?

Hey guys,

I'm at 21 days today, and I noticed this on a quit attempt earlier this year too (that one lasted ~six days). I'm pretty happy with how I'm doing, and feel like I've kicked it for good now. I've noticed, however, that my gums seem to be growing excessively and in some places have become quite painful when brushing.

I had a check up very recently (about two months ago) and was told all was well, and have probably been taking even better care of myself since then. So I'm just wondering, is this something that I'd be likely to experience/others have experienced? It's difficult to know what I can chalk up to being a symptom of quitting and what needs to be checked out, as googling has yielded a lot of conflicting information.

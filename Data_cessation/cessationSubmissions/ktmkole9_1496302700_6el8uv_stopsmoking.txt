Help.

My mom smokes over a pack a day probably about 2 packs. We've got her e-cigs, patches, you name it. She doesent try it because she's tried to quit before and it's to hard for her as she has Multiple Sclerosis and feels like shit even without trying to quit. Does anyone know how to help her quit without making the withdrawls so bad she can't bear it with her MS.

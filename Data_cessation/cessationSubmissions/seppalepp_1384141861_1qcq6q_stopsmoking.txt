I am embarking on the journey.

24 y/o male here. Started smoking when I was 20, got serious about it and bought my first pack when I was 21.  I've unsuccessfully quit about a dozen times or so.

I've made a new group of friends who do not smoke. I've developed a fantastic relationship with these people and finally had an emotional breakdown in front of them last night. I hated myself for being a smoker.  My grandfather has one lung thanks to cancer from 50 years of smoking and my grandmother emphysema. My dad, although not in front of us, smokes daily for work. 

I was diagnosed with bladder cancer when I was 17 years old. It was a benign tumor, taken care of by outpatient surgery and no chemo. It was mild, but still the "c" word. I therefore was entirely ashamed of smoking in front of anyone I knew. I isolated myself, I'd think to myself every time I lit a heater, why do you do this. But I did it. 

Woke up this morning, threw out my pack of cigarettes and made a pledge to my friends that this was the end. I think having a stable support group around myself is going to be key, and I am thinking about getting into exercising a bit more in lieu of quitting. 

The cravings are real. But I'm 24 hours into it and I'm not going back this time. 

I owe it to myself to see how great I can be.

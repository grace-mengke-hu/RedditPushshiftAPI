I started vaping 4 months ago and after the first couple days haven't had the slightest urge for cigarettes.Has anyone else had this and did you ever go back to smoking?

I haven't really been trying to decrease the nicotine at all or quit because I enjoy it so much (I get the 3mg nicotine liquid which is the lowest I can find near me). I can't imagine ever going back but I am kind of concerned that keeping the nicotine addiction could potentially lead back to cigarettes.

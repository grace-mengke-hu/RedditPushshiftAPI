Summertime...

I'm happy I've quit smoking. I'm happy I've been able to make it 45 days. I feel so much better with myself. I can run without feeling like I was going to die. I played softball on Sunday, and managed to get two triples and an inside the park home run because I could RUN...

But damn do I ever miss sitting outside in the sun on my deck drinking a beer and having a smoke.

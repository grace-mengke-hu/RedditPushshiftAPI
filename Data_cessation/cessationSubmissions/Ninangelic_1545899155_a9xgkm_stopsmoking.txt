Hello! It's me again.

I wrote not long ago about the "perfect day to quit". I still think the perfect day to quit is RIGHT NOW and even if my last attempt didn't work I'm not giving up.

I know I really want this because it's basically on my mind every day, all day. Last time I tried with the patch and lozenges. In my head I'm not the kind of person who can quit cold turkey, but after reading a lot since then I've decided that I wanna do it that way so I can proudly say that I am 100% free from nicotine. 

Yesterday I managed 18 hours and then I cracked. The hours went by so slow. I didn't know what to do with myself and I was constantly thinking about the ciggies. Having a boyfriend who lives with me who smokes and doesn't wanna quit until after an happening in January makes it a bit harder too because there's still cigarettes around me. I could wait and do it in January, but I don't wanna suffer through more weeks as a smoker. It really makes me unhappy. And I wanna kick off the new year smoke free! I just can't wait for my boyfriend to be ready. That is just another excuse to continue.

I know exactly what I have to do. I have to stop and then not take another puff. That's it. I know it will be hell at first, but it will pass. The benefits of quitting is better than continuing. The mind games is what usually gets to me. I know that is my addiction talking trying to lure me back in.

I spend a lot of time lurking here and it makes me so happy seeing everyone post their success. I wanna be one of you :) Sorry for rambling again. I don't have many to talk about with this who understand the struggles :P

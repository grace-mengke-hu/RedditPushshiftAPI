On my last pack

I'm 23 and I've only been smoking for about a year, but the addiction hit me the moment I started. I've tried quitting cold turkey three times so far and failed each time. I'm about half way through what I want to be my last pack right now. I feel like I need to taper myself off of them instead of quitting cold turkey, but that might just be my brain telling me I need nicotine. 

I've been on this pack for about four days so far, which is an improvement from half a pack a day. The biggest contributing factor is that I've quit smoking in my car (I drive a lot for work) and keep my cigarettes in my garage.

Wish me luck, guys. I need it.

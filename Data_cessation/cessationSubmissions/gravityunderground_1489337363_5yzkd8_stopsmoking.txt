Day 76 - free at last! But staying vigilant

Can't believe we're in Month 3 of 2017 already. Glad I stuck with it although the first month was anguish.

New year resolutions CAN be honored and a healthy life is possible. Can't express how great I feel and I wish it for everyone on this subreddit. If you're here reading this, you must REALLY want to quit. It is definitely doable. The first month is going to rock you hard, but ride that bull and the addiction WILL give in .

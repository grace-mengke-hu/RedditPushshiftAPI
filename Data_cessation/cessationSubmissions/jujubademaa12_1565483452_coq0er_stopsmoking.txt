How do I convince my dad to stop smoking?

Hello. I created this account to post this. Sorry if my English isn't the best.
My dad is a smoker it's been a 2 years or so. He used to smoke 24 years ago, but when my brother was born he stopped.
He suffers from depression (he stopped treatment) and spends hours and hours of a day without eating, so he lost a lot o weight, but he eats a lot at night and mostly not healthy food. So he lives by coffee and cigarettes and I'm very worried about him but I don't know how to approach him because I'm not very good with words.
Any advice?

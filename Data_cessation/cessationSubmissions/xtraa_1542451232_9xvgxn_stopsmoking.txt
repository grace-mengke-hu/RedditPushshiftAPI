For anyone who also want to get from n00b to 1337, these two things helped me the most. I hope they will help you, too. 

\- Get the Pavlov bell out of your mind. Always wait at least 5 minutes when you have cravings. Even as a smoker, these five minutes will distract your brain from the immediate pleasure of smoking a cancer-stick. Be very strict about it because the main reason why nicotine is so addictive IS BECAUSE IT WORKS INSTANTLY.

\- Don't trust yourself. Nicotine as a molecule is very similar to serotonine, hence your brain over time started using it as a replacement. That's why smokers usually light one up in emotional situations like stress, pleasure or pain. It's very common that you will try to trick yourself or talk yourself into a reason for smoking a cig. Don't.

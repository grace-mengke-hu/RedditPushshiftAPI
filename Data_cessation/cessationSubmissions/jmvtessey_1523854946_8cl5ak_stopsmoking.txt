Every time you say no to smoking you get stronger and the cigarette gets weaker

It's hard to stop smoking but eventually, one month from the day you stop, you won't even want to smell a cigarette close to you. It is only the addiction that keeps you smoking, the taste is horrible, smell is horrible. There is nothing pleasurable from it except that your brain loves the nicotine: it's been highjacked by it. 

To stop smoking you need a plan. Something to replace the cigarette with. For me it was chewing gum, replaced every cigarette i would have smoked in two weeks for a gum. It worked like magic, but it was hard. You really crave it. The good news is, every time you say no to smoking, you get stronger and the cigarette gets weaker.

Fell Off The Wagon, I'm Getting Back On Again

Hi /r/stopsmoking, a couple of months ago I made the choice to put down smokes. I was doing GREAT! Then my dad, who had pancreatic cancer, began his dying process which lasted about 3 weeks. 

I went to be with my family and help my mother.  I picked up the habit again due to stress of taking care of my dad, I guess, and oddly my brother smokes and it was kind of a bonding thing, we would go smoke and chat about the things going on.

I'm kicking myself for ever picking this habit back up, I cried last night because I was doing so well and then it was back to a pack a day.

I'm done with this. I'm done with the wasted money, the coughing, the smell and the need to take "breaks" all the damn time. I want to reclaim my life, I don't want to be addicted to something anymore.

Sorry if this turned into a bit of a ramble. I just wanted to get this all off of my chest. 

[This is how I feel right now.](http://gph.is/1j2oPo3)

I haven't smoked since 9:00pm last night, which means I got through the morning without needing my "first thing waking up" smoke.

Wish me luck, I want this more than anything.

Giving myself a present for my birthday - stopping smoking

Well, I'm back again.

After quitting for close to 2 months in 2015 with the help of Zyban, I fell off the wagon spectacularly. It didn't take much - a particularly stressful period at work.

God, I am so sick of this merry-go-round. The amount of times I've tried to quit, the amount of different methods I've used (Alan Carr, patches, gum, lozenges, e-cigs, Zyban, cold turkey, apps....)

Today is my 34th birthday. I have been smoking for close to 16 years. 

I choose to give myself the gift if health today because I deserve it, my body deserves a reprieve from the abuse of nicotine addiction. I am perfectly capable of doing this and achieving this. 

I want to do this for myself and my future - I want to resume my running regime without the guilt and the knowledge that I would have better capacity to run if I had not started smoking again. 

Thank you for your time, and thanks to r/stopsmoking for existing.

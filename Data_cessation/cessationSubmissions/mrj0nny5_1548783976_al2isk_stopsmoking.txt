Advice on how to help someone quit smoking.

So my boyfriend grew up around constant second hand smoke.  When he left his parents for college he got withdrawal from not having second hand smoke.  He later started smoking on his own and has been for the last 5 years.  He's tried to quit cold turkey in the past but hasn't been able to stay with it.  He smoke a pack a day and we both hate it.  I personally feel like I make him smoke more when I'm around because when we have sex, he smokes.  Showers, he smokes.  Eats food, he smokes.  Driving makes him anxsty so he has to smoke before and after we drive any decent distance.  I want to support and help him but I don't know how to go about it with out feeling naggy or assholish.

I am finally happy to quit smoking !

After 14 years of smoking (32 yo today) one pack a day, and several attempts to quit (nicotine gums, gradual reduction, cold turkey...), I have finally convinced myself (and with the help of Allen Carr's book) to become a happy non-smoker !

I reached a point where I was so anxious to simply smoke a cigarette (I am deeply afraid of cancer, and I guess this is part of a vicious circle started by the cigarette), I felt in a poor physical form, with daily aches, pains, tingling, etc...

And, worst of all, I had lost all my self-confidence. Knowing that I was killing myself consciously, day after day, without being able to stop, was slowly dragging me towards depression.

I was afraid of missing smoking in all my social events (since all my friends are smokers), afraid to not being able to enjoy a coffee or a beer without cigarette.

But now I am happily looking forward to my next party on Friday night, and I will enjoy it for sure !

Cheers to all of you


EDIT: thanks for your comments, this subreddit really is a nice place to start breaking this terrible habit, knowing i am not alone doing this is of great help ! I will report back as soon as possible.

For now, my first two days went okay. I have finished Allen Carr book before Day 1, and watched an Allen Carr conference yesterday. Just a few very short-lasting cravings since i stopped. I'm still a bit nervous for my saturday party, but that is part of the challenge :)

EDIT 2: i did two interesting things as well while quitting :
- i filmed myself smoking my last cigarette. It was midnight and I just finished Allen Carr's book, and this last cigarette felt disguting, as you can see it on my face during the movie :)

- I wrote a short story about my smoker life, trying to picture everyday moment when smoking was in my life. After reading it, I felt so sorry for myself, and filled with disgust.

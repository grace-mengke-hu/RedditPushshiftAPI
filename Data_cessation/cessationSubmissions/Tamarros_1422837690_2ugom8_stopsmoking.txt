Yay for me. What about my dad?

So, I quit smoking about a month ago[20/F], and I'm really trying to get my dad to quit too. He's 62, smoking for about 40 years now and is far from healthy. Anyway, he's going to this support group, but they mostly just piss him off.. He's difficult that way, always suspicious that everyone's trying to sell him something (I guess the best analogy for him would be Red Forman)

I could really use some advice for somehow convincing him to stop by changing his way of thinking about it. (No, I couldn't make him read Allen Carr)

Any help is greatly appreciated (:

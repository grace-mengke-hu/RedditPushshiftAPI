Breathing never felt this easy

SS - When i was smoking, i guess i never paid attention to how i breathed.  How hard or easy it was.

But I'm 70+ days clean now.  Last week my physical therapist cleared me to jog again (old knee injury kept me from the treadmill for a while).  He told me to start at 10 minutes on the treadmill, at ~5.5mph.  I did - it felt amazing.

There was actually this moment when the rhythm of the music in my headphones, and my footfalls, and my breathing all synced up.  And breathing felt *natural*.

I've done Couch-to-5k before, while smoking a pack a day.  And it was definitely an uphill battle.  But starting it again, smoke-free, it just seems so easy this time around.  I love that feeling.

Thanks everyone for your support.  Because of my efforts & this community, i'm smoke-free for >70 days, and have had some of the greatest workouts of my life in the last week.

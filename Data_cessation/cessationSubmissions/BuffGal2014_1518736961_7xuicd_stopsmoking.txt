Guys, I'm having a serious issue and it's really starting to tick me off....

I quit smoking almost 2 weeks ago while still puffing on my ecig.  I switched over to zero nicotine e-liquid on saturday so I have been nicotine free since then.  My problem is that my stomach has NOT stopped growling since the day I quit almost 2 weeks ago.  I don't mean I'm having an "I'm bored because I'd normally be smoking, so I'm gonna eat" sort of feeling.  I mean that I am having the physical feeling of my stomach growling, and even when I eat until I am stuffed, the feeling does not go away.  I'm getting really upset by this because I lost 50 lbs last year and I am not going back to that weight.  I don't know if this is something anyone else has experienced or if it is normal.  I can't find anything about it when I Google it, just stomach pain comes up.  I am NOT going to pick up cigarettes ever again but I need to know that this is going to stop, I am getting hopeless here....

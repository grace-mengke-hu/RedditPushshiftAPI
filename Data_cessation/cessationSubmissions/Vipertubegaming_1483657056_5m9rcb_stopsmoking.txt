Day 3 of Cold Turkey quit

Hi /r/stopsmoking . I started smoking 4 years ago, at age 12, to "fit in" with the group of friends I had. However I recently decided to quit. I am currently on day 3, and I am getting the strongest cravings for a cigarette I have ever had, stronger cravings than when when I quit for 6 weeks. I honestly think I might relapse but I am trying to stay positive. My chest feels much better now, considering smoking certainly did not help my asthma. It's hard for me to quit as I am still at that stage where I enjoy smoking, but hopefully I won't be lighting up any time soon. Thank you for reading.

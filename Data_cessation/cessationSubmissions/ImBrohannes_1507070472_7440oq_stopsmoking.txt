I caved and smoked a pack after just 4 days ðŸ˜”

Apparently quitting is tougher than I thought. Long story short, I quit right before a tough exam. Being used to smoking while I studyâ€”and especially while studying for exams , I caved and smoked a pack. I can't tell if I'm posting because I want advice/consolation, or if I'm posting simply to vent. Either way, I figure people in this community understand what I'm going through.

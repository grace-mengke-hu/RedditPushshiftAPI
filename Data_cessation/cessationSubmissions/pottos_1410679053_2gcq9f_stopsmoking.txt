Is withdrawal worse with heavier smokers?

Hello there, it's been 8 hours since my last smoke. I'm moving to a state where cigs are expensive and frankly I'm just done with smoking, I'm ready to feel good for once. What I'd like to know is this: If I smoked 1/2 a cig every day for the past week, will my withdrawal be less intense than someone who stops cold turkey after a pack a day? 

I'm not looking forward to withdrawal and I'm not too excited to be grouchy at my friends and family all day/week/month, and I can't handle any more stress with college starting, and really, all I want is some affirmation that the withdrawal won't be as bad as I think. I've been smoking for two years and I'm ready for it to be over. Thanks and good luck.

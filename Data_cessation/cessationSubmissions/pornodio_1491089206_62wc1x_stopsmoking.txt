Day 40, smoked one, need advice

I really didnt want to smoke it. Just moved to a big city and went out and it was full of beautiful people smoking, and there was this one girl. I drank a few beers and got a little depressed because of loneliness so i bought a pack and went to this girl to ask a lighter. She obviously said no but her friend was smoking so i felt obliged to light it up and smoked it. It gave me a little buzz. The girl disappeared forever so i threw the pack away. Now i'm a little drunk but still feel guilty. How do i cope? Thanks

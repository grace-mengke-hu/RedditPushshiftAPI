Close call, made myself proud

Recently gave smoking the boot again.  I'm only on day four, but the cravings are almost non-existent (using the patch).  Something just feels different this time around.

Anyway, I came back from the range yesterday and was meeting my wife for lunch.  I went to stow my pistol in the center console (planned on having a beer and didn't want to open carry) and there they were...the three smokes I had forgotten about! My "emergency stash" that I always had in the truck in case I ran out during the day.

I saw my buddy's truck in the parking lot.  It took all the will power I had to walk in, go right up to him and say "Guess what I found in my truck?  Take them, I quit."

Kind of felt like I needed the symbolic gesture of giving them away willingly.  It would have been way too easy to sneak one and then go inside...so I'm happy with myself.

I've finally understood now that it's just like an alcoholic.  I will *never* be able to have just the one smoke and stop there.

Cheers to all of you, this sub has been great motivation so far.

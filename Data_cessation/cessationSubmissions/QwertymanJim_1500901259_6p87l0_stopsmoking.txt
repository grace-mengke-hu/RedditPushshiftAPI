1 week without cigarettes

Not much to add other than that, just happy to have made it a week.

I do feel really good today. Aside from a bit of a cough I'm feeling much better than I did last week - Chest doesn't hurt, I can breathe, I can smell things (the air conditioning in my car stinks of damp when turned on, never noticed that before!)  

Thanks to this sub and everyone here. Y'all are so supportive to anyone and everyone who posts and wants to quit or is on their journey to a smoke free life.

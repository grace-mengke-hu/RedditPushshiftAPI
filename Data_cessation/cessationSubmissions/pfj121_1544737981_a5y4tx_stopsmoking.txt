One Year Today!

I quit smoking one year ago today! I smoked a pack a day for about 22 years. Which is hard to believe now.

It took a combination of things coming together for me to stop. First, I was ready -- truly ready to stop. I was tired of hiding the behavior. I was tired of the expense, not just on cigarettes but also on gum, mints, mouthwash, whatever to cover it up. I was tired of feeling held-back at my gym, which is super competitive. And a couple of dates mentioned they were into me. But not into my smoking. That was embarrassing.

So I listened to Allen Carr's The Easy Way, and that really put things into motion because it changed my mindset. Then I took Chantix for a little over three months, but smoked my last cigarette about three weeks into the Chantix.

I really credit the book for motivating me to act, and for getting me to where I am today. I am sure the Chantix also helped (though that was my third attempt with Chantix -- I had never tried the book as part of previous attempts). It had side effects but I did not care, since I knew they were temporary, and worth it if I stopped smoking permanently.

I enjoy all the usual benefits health-wise. I upgraded to a "luxury" brand car bc I could swing a higher payment with the money I saved on cigarettes and accompanying gear. 

Stopping also propelled me in other areas of my life. It became a motivator. I got a promotion at work. Moved in with my now-SO. (One who did not like my smoking!) And now working on quitting drinking, which is as hard for me as quitting smoking. But damnit. If I can stop smoking, I really believe I can do anything.

Hang in there. I know it is hard. But it is worth it, and you will be so proud of yourself. :)

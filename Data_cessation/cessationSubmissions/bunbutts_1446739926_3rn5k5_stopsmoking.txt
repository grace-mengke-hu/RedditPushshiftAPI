Yesterday I had enough and quit.

Hello. 
I wanted to drop a little intro now that I found a good sub reddit to post it in. I have smoked for about 5 years. (From age 17-22) 

I was and am self-destructive/depressed/anxious which lead me to start smoking and keep smoking. It was a way to hurt but also soothe myself. I'm scared the next time I have a panic attack what will I do. I do not want to smoke. How do you calm yourself down?

I have an appointment tomorrow for a spirometry test, and I am scared of the results. I have always been very allergic, and most likely have asthma because of smoking. I find my breath sometimes making wheezy noises when I lay down. It's worse if I go out and walk. Just walking makes me feel like I am breathing through a straw. Are these symptoms going to last? I know asthma is treatable, but can I make full recovery? I am so scared. Does anyone else here have asthma or something similar?


Thanks for reading and sorry for possible typos, non-english person here.

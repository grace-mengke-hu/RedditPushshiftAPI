Starting Today.

Quitting cold turkey starting today. Just moved into a new place and I can't afford to be smoking not only financially but physically as well. I'm 23 and I've only been smoking for about 2 and a half years. I smoke about half a pack a day. Main triggers for me are anxiety, alcohol, and boredom. I've recently started to try and eat healthier and get more exercise as well. Anybody else have success with quitting cold turkey?

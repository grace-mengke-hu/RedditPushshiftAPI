19 days and counting

The first few days were really hard. I found that walking when I was able helped alot. When I wasn't able to walk because I was working, I drank chamomile tea. It really helped with the anxiety. And drinking the sleepy time tea at night helped me to calm down enough to sleep some nights, other nights I used IBprofen PM.  The last few days have been really hard....but I know in the long run it will be worth it.

One year ago today I smoked my last cigarette! I never thought I would get this far...you can too!

My badge says today is 364 days, because I quit at about 8pm tonight, but it has been a year. A WHOLE FREAKING YEAR. During that year I have drank, eaten big meals, been stressed out, gone on long drives, socialized, fought with my boyfriend, worked long hours and 100 other things...but I have done all those things without smoking. If you would have asked me a year ago, I would have listed those exact things as all my 'triggers' but now they are not. They are just things that everyone does, mostly without smoking to accompany them. 

I used Allen Carr's book - some people hate it, some people love it. I am obviously one of the people that love it. In celebration of my quit, I posted to facebook that I would buy books for a few people that wanted them, and I have already shipped my first book. I have recommended the book to half a dozen people already, all of whom have quit. It might be for you, it might not, but for $13, isn't it worth a shot - especially if you are struggling right now?

If right now is your first hour, your first day, your first month or whatever - know that it DOES get better. For some of you, it is probably impossible to even conceive of a life that doesn't include smoke breaks every few hours, or having a hour or two pass where you don't at least THINK about smoking.  Seriously though, it is possible, and not just that, it WILL happen. Give it time. Stay strong, have a support system and GOOD LUCK!

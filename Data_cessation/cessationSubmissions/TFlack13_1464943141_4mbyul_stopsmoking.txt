I feel like I've tried quitting 1000 times.

I've tried using the stop smoking app, e-cigs, nicotine gum, and cold turkey. Every time I try to quit I make a full hearted decision to quit, but the longest I've made it is 5 days. I don't necessarily know what I'm posting this for, I guess, but I just want to stop smoking and get back to being able to run without feeling like my chest is going to burst. Thanks for reading my rant.

Heart-wrenching moment with my 3 year old.

To cut a long story short, I was just about to drop my son off at his aunties for a couple of hours and I was going to give in and buy a 20 pack. 

I know, I’m not far in to my stop smoking journey but hey, I was going to crack. 

UNTILL, I was putting my son in the car and he noticed one of my old packets on the floor with the picture of the tooth decay and gum disease pics on. He pointed it out and asked me what it was &amp; in his own words he said “it’s a baddy” .

I said back to him “yeah, that’s what happens if you smoke cigarettes” 

To which he replied “but daddy you smoke cigarettes” (obviously, he’s only 3 so he sounded like he said “cigreds” lol).

As soon as that moment happened I was literally mind blown, it was like a film scenario! Something inside of me just shattered. Needless to say, I thought nah I ain’t gunna go and buy them I wanna be clean for his sake. It really made me realise how it will effect his life if I carry on.I suffer from mental health issues and from previous attempts to quit I always gave in because of them but no, not this time. 

How many times am I gunna go around in circles and let the cigarettes win? Well, if I keep letting it happen I will only get deeper and deeper down the hole of addiction.  This is honestly a true story that just happened to me, I’m not fishing for upvotes I’m just sharing what happened. 

Thank You.

How long does addiction take? I have no addiction.

I started smoking e cig one specifically called a Juul for about 8 months now. 3 weeks ago I decided to stop because the cartridges costed too much money and I used them fast. About one cart every 3 days and one cart is equal to a pack of cigarettes it says on the website. So when I stopped that it was a little hard but 3 weeks later and I'm completely off it and have no desire. 

I started smoking real cigarettes right after I quit the e cig and stoped those about 4 days ago because I couldn't stand the smell on my clothes, car, breathe, etc. I never had any cravings or anything. I haven't had e cig or a real cig for a while and I am wondering if I should have some cravings at this point. 

Are some people not able to get addicted? Or does it take a longer amount of time? I'm so confused cause everywhere it says the addiction is sooo strong and almost impossible to stop yet I stopped just like anyone who doesn't smoke.

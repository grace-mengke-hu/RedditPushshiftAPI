1 week down and im super stoked!

Hey fellow quitters! I just got to my one week mark and i haven't felt this good in such a long time. When i was smoking i was working out and running but now I can actually breathe and not cough as much. When I quit i decided I wanted to run marathons. Now I am running farther and faster. I just feel so good mentally a physically! I ran into some temptations but i just had to buckle down and resist. The marathon idea I had was for a personal achievement but also to help me keep on track. I would rather have a life time of self gratification and achievement then the 5-10 minutes of gratification a cigarette would give me!

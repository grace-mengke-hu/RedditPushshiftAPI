100 days!

Okay,  I missed my 100 day milestone, and it's really 102! 
I've gained about 10 pounds, but I've never felt better in my life both psychically and mentally. I have A TON  more energy and confidence.

What helped me most, you might wonder? 

"Non smokers don't crave cigarettes when they are stressed"

"The only thing making you crave the next smoke is the one you just had"

(Butchered Allan Carr quotes)

Seriously,  anyone trying to quit...just do it. It is the best feeling ever.

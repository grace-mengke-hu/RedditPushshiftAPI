NYE Conundrum

So, I welcomed in the New Year in an exciting fashion. I did take two inhales of hookah, although I'm not sure if I even got anything from it since I was pretty trashed. 

Also, the girl I hooked up with is a smoker, but I didn't even want one at all.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that even if I did smoke a bit of hookah, no cig touched my lips and my resolve is just as strong, if not stronger.

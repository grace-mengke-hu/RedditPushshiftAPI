Day 16 and doing ok

So I'm here because I'm back tracking missions on my stop smoking app and thought I'd join in, it's supposed to help right?ðŸ™‚
I am 16 days smoke free (2nd successful quitting of anything more than 2 days) and firmly believe that I can never have another puff if you want to stay smoke free. 
My problem is 2 things, I feel like I enjoy smoking and also that as I have smoked since the age of 12 years old (now 39), it is so entrenched in everything I do that I'm not only quitting smoking I'm also learning while new routines and changing everything I do. 
I have tried over the years, all types of NRT on numerous occasions, cold turkey, the Allen Carr book (pointless if you ask me) and various types of early electric cigarette and more recently vaping. The only thing that worked for me on both occasions was champix, not for everyone I know, but for me it was the 'easy' quit. I do not set a quit date on champix but by week 4 or 5 I do not want to smoke. Only when the champix finishes do I have cravings and I can distract myself. I stopped with champix before but then had some upsetting news, decided I could cope with smoking for one night because I needed it, we all know how that turned out!!
So here I am smoke free again and feeling wiser than before. Fingers crossed ðŸ˜€

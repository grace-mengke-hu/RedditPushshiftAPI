smoking dreams

So, quit smoking on the New years, went a couple of weeks without smoking, smoked 2 cigerettes randomly on a lazy sunday afternoon, now 1 week without smoking again. Almost every other night, i have these intense dreams in which Im usually smoking a cigerette, my cravings have reduced significantly when Im up, but Im just glad every time I wake up that I didnt smoke in real life. Will the dreams ever stop? Its more or less everyday and it bugs me.

how does r/stopsmoking feel about vaping?

fairly new to this sub, but i was wondering how you guys feel about vaping over traditional cigarettes. I've been a smoker since a very young age, and at 26 i'm starting to realize it isn't as cool as i thought. I went out and bought a fairly nice vape battery and ever since i haven't bought a pack. Am i making progress by inhaling water vapor over an analog cigarette?

Ill effects after quitting smoking.

I think that we should all start a mega-thread or sticky on what to expect when to quit smoking. 

I ask because there's certain things that happen while cleansing your body of all the shit you were putting in it, yknow?

Anyone care to share or talk about something that seemed ill-inducing at first, for example the "lump in the back of throat" or smokers "flu" people get after quitting.

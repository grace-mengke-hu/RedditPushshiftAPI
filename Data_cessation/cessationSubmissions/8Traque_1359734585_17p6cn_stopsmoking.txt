A proud moment!

In a couple of days, I will have made it a full year smoke-free.  It'll be the first smoke-free year I've had since about 1993.  However, that's not why I'm posting today... I'm posting because my wife and I just returned from a 5 day cruise without the kids... which means we spent *a lot* of time at various bars, drinking most everything that was put in front of us.

Which brings me to my proud moment...

We were returning to our ship after a day of 'shopping' and seeing the sites (read: drinking free tequila at *every* store/restaurant we walked into), when we decided to stop and grab one one last cheap drink.

Once the drinks came, my wife looked at me and apologized, right before she pulled a pack of smokes out of her purse and  lit up. I knew that she hadn't quit- but, she's been courteous enough not to smoke around me.

The lighting and her first drag almost went in slow-motion.

Immediately, the addict in me began rationalizing and making excuses for why it'd be okay to have *just one*.  

"It's only one...", "I haven't had one in so long, I could just have *one*, right?" and "Who's going to know?"... even went so far as to pull the "Fuck it, I'm an adult- if I want to smoke, I will!"

Now- keep in mind that I was completely intoxicated... By my wife's count, she cut me off after about 30 or so tequilas and I switched to beer.  I would have thought that this level of inebriation would have hindered my ability to say no to myself about having a smoke... much to my surprise, it had the opposite effect: clarity.  Well, clarity as far as having a cigarette was concerned... not much else was clear :)

I couldn't believe I was even having this internal debate.  I was about to mark a full year- my *first* full year- without a cigarette.  I wasn't about to spoil everything that I'd accomplished and start all over.

This quitting wasn't easy.  It ~~was~~ **is** one of the hardest things that I've ever undertaken, if not *the* hardest.

I just sat back, pulled on my cerveza again while surveying the bluest water I've ever seen and let her finish her cigarette in peace, proud of myself for once again showing that I **am** stronger than the addiction.  I just have to believe it.

If I can say "no" when I'm shitty on tequila, I can say "no" anytime.

Fuck yea.

TL;DR: While on vacation in Mexico with my wife, I didn't throw the past year away- despite tequila.

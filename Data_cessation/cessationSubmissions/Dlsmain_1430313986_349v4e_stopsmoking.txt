It's been 2 days maybe?

So it's been two days without a smoke and I just had one, I don't know I woke up and just felt it... I've only been smoking for a couple of years so it can't be as bad as some of you guys have it right? It's hard though in the military my job gives me a lot of downtime and a bunch of the other guys always smoke and they always want a "fresh air break" that's what gets me. Also I've gotten to know a lot about my supervisors and they always taught me good life lessons and about the job because of the fresh air breaks. I would like to keep getting in good with my bosses because I've learned most of the things I know today out at the smoke pit and made a lot of great friends because I smoked with them. I feel the hardest pert to quit for me is the social aspect, how would you guys deal with it?

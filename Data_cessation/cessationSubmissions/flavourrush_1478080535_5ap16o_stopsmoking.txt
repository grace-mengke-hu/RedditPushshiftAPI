worst is the fear of starting again.

I had a dream last night. i was smoking a cigarette and hated myself at the same time. I woke up in a state of shock and then again totally relieved.

my takeaway: the fear of being weak is haunting me. the fear of shame. that's a VERY good sign. my brain is working subconciously on me. it wants me to understand that smoking is danger. monkey see smoke bad? monkey better not do.

day 63, i got this.

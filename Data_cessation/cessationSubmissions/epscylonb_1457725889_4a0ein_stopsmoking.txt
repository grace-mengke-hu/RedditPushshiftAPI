Living with a smoker again...

Wanted to write something because I recently went through a break up, tbh I was never worried about it making me want to smoke again. I'm at the point where I can't remember my last craving and the thought of wasting money of cigarettes is baffling.

But the break up does mean I am living with my mother again for the first time in over a decade. She is a life long smoker and it's been a while since I have lived with someone who smokes indoors and as much as she does.

I was nervous before moving back, worried that the smell and second hand smoke would turn me back into a nicotine junkie.

I'm glad to report that after a few weeks it hasn't happened.

it definitely isn't pleasant living with someone who smokes as much as my mother does. And it saddens me when I realise the smell of smoke makes me want to move out again sooner rather than later.

But I have had zero cravings, it's all just re-enforcing my decision to stop smoking. 

I'm not going to get complacent, after all my mother stopped for a couple of years when I was kid and then started again. 

I think it will be easier for me to stay stopped though, I live in a country where cigarettes ads are banned and can't be on display in shops. Both measures I strongly support since it means people aren't tempted when they are feeling down. 

Obviously I wish my mother would stop too, but if anyone had told me to stop when I was smoking I would have replied with rude words. I firmly believe it's something you have to do on your own. If anyone does have any advice about this I would be interested though.

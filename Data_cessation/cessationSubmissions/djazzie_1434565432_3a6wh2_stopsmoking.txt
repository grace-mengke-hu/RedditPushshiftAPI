After nearly 3 months, cravings are almost gone...

So, I'm almost at my 90 day mark. Wahoo! It feels like forever, yet 3 months is almost no time at all. 

In my 90 days, I've managed to avoid smoking despite:
1) having a near death experience (a very bad car accident)
2) being surrounded by smokers at a friend's house
3) finishing a mandatory health exam for insurance purposes

That last one was a major factor for not smoking, as I didn't want to have to pay double for my life insurance and I didn't know exactly when the exam was going to be. 

As I said, cravings are almost entirely a thing of the past. I maybe think about smoking once a week...maybe even less. And whenever I get a craving, I just think about all the hard work I'd be throwing away. 

I really thought this was going to be impossible. It was hard, but not impossible. And I'm so glad for where I am.

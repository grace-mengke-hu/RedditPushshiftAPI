300 Days!

I saw QuittingLizzy's post and it reminded me that I quit right when my wife and I decided we wanted to have a baby.  Well, it's been 300 days smoke free and our baby boy arrived Monday. I couldn't be any happier.  His innocent little face is a constant reminder that I need to be on this earth as many days as I possibly can.  I just wanted to thank the community for helping me along and also if anyone out there is in the same position I was, please know that the fight is worth it.

Just because I'm a proud papa, [here's a pic of me and my buddy.  :)](http://i.imgur.com/liQJR0I.jpg)

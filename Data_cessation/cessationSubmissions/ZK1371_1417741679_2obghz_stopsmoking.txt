I smoked a cigarette last weekend and I'm so glad that I did

I was hanging out with a friend from high school last weekend. I had told him I had quit smoking and he was cool about it. Then some friends from the Marines came by to party with us. So here I am, getting drunk with a bunch of my friends and I finally asked one of the guys for a drag off their cigarette

We were all too drunk to realize what I was doing, but I'm really glad I did it because that tasted like shit. I had urges before that were socially crippling, but now I know that I'm not going to like it anyways even if I do get my hands on one. 

Thanks for letting me share this and also, 30 days!

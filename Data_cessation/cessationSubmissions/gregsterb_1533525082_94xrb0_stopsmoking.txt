Patches + Gum or Cold Turkey

I'm sure this has been asked before but I prefer a fresh discussion on it. I have 3 packs left until I quit. I'm wondering if the stats we read about that say people are more successful using patches or other aids then they are cold turkey? From people who have quit, is it easier to get the nictotene out of your system right away by going cold turkey or is lessening the blow with the patches a better approach?   
    
    
One other question, what normal gum, candy, lolipops, etc did you find the best for keeping.your mouth busy?    
   
Ok I lied, one more. As a coffee drinker, did you find switching to Tea or something else helped or did you just continue drinking coffee ? 

Thanks!

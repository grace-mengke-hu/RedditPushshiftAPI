Being a Smoker *feels* like a lifetime ago

Today I was doing laundry and washed a scarf that had not been washed since I quit.  I initially wondered to myself why so much time had passed since I washed it- then, realized it was only 3 months ago.  

That realization hit me like a ton of bricks: The concept of being a smoker is now separate and unique from my present.   I could never comprehend such a thing because cigarettes were so ingrained within every aspect of my life - including laundry.  

That said, I still get cravings daily, which I deal with - but the cravings and a smoker's life feel like 2 different things.    

Thank you all on the sub for all the help.  I will not smoke with any of you today!

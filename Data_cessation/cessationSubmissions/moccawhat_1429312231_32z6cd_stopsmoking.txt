I bought a pack, help. (Edit)

>I've been going through a lot lately and today at work just made it worse. I took a few drags off a coworkers cigarette and it was downhill from there, I was so disappointed and broken in a fit of frustration I drove and bought a pack and I've been sitting in my new car crying and holding the first smoke. Need some encouragement now. I'm falling apart and feel like shit about this but I can't put it down, I'm frozen, fighting myself.<

Edit: thank you friends for the help this afternoon. I cried clutching the pack in one hand and cigarette in the other. I screamed and cried then I heard a nearby car door close, it was my boss. She smokes like a chimney and she was parked right next to me! I suddenly noticed I was subconsciously rolling the passenger window up as not to get smoke in my car (the one I recently purchased, $340 of my down payment was money I saved NOT smoking!) And that's when I realized that deep deep down I truly did not want to smoke although in the moments leading up to that moment I would've done anything for one. In combination with that realization and the encouragement of you guys I didn't smoke that Fucking shit!!! You guys seriously Fucking rock my socks and THANK YOU!

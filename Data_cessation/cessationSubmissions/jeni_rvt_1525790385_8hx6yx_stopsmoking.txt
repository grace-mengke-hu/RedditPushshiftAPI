Longest 17 hours ever.

Good morning.  New here. Been a smoker for roughly 20 years (33/f).  I had one of those epiphany moments this weekend watching my friends get wasted and smoking every 10 minutes. And don’t get me wrong, I’m usually right there with them.  But I wasn’t.

I have been wanting to quit for a while.  I have met someone that is quite important to me about 6 months ago.  Her mother died of lung cancer.  And even though she lives far away, she is one of the reason I want to.  

Also, my mum is having health issues and I know I am a large stressor in her life so I am doing this for her as well.

But most importantly, I am doing this for me.  I don’t want to die a slow, painful death.  I want to be able to ride my bike, walk my dogs, go up stairs...

So here I am... I have never attempted this before. EVER.  My head is killing me.  My throat hurts and I am naueous.  But 17 hours down...

I really want to quit (again) but I don't quite know how.

Hi there,

I smoked for a good 17 years until I quit on new year 2013. I stayed quit for almost an entire year but then we got stationed overseas with the military and I got really stressed and started again. So it's been a year and I want that non smoker feeling back so much! I'm so tired of being a slave to cigarettes. 
My husband is deployed for another few months and I want to quit for him, too. The thing is just that my brain makes me think I should do it on some specific date or a date with significance of some sort, even though I know it doesn't matter. I keep pushing it out and it's really annoying me. I'm having a hard time to simply "do it". I also have a bit of seasonal depression going on (I ordered a daylight lamp, as I live a lot more north now than I used to).

How did you all decide "now" is the time?

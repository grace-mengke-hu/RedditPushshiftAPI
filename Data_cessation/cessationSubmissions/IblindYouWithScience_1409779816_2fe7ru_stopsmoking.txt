How do I talk to my mom about her smoking?

Obviously quitting smoking is a very personal decision, but I feel like I'm not being a good daughter by just ignoring the fact that my mother is hurting herself. She's been a smoker for 30 years and she's my life. My father and I both express our distaste for smoking, and I'm sure he's had talks with her over the years about how he doesn't like it, but to my knowledge, she has never tried to quit. 

If she had tried and failed, I wouldn't be quite as concerned. I'd feel like there was hope for her to try again. But at this point I just wonder what I could possibly say to her to help her realize that she's hurting herself and her family by continuing. 

How can I talk to her about this without sounding like a broken record or just another person nagging her about how dangerous it is? Is it even possible?

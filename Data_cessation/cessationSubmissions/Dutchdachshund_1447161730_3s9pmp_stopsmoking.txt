Immune system meltdown?

Hey guys,
I quit smoking 8 days ago, and while I don't have many urges (don't even feel the need to start again), my body seems to have gone into a frenzy. I've currently developed a cold sore, eye infection and am itching like crazy. I'm slowly turning into Quasimodo. 
Does anybody know why this is happening and more importantly, when it will stop? Tnx!!

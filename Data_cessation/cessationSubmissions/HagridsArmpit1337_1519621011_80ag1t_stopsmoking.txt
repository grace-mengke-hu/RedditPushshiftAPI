Low energy is ruining my life

Ever since quitting I’ve had really low energy all the time, I’m usually always moving around and doing something but now all I wanna do is lie down and stare at the wall all day, it’s changing my personality as well, I’m usually the confident load talkative social guy but ever since quitting I don’t even have enough energy to talk which makes people think I’m a shy quiet person, for those who went through this how long did it take to get your energy back? It’s been 5 weeks for me and it’s still not back

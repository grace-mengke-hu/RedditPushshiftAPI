First dream about smoking

So preface: I have not yet had coffee, please excuse words.

I had my first dream about smoking. I don't dream often. Basically never, in fact. I've been quit for 5 weeks, patches and lozenges. I switched to a clear patch (vs opaque) yesterday, same level of nicotine. Last night I woke up sobbing because the dream I had, which wasn't even about me! Dreamt that my mother, who is very obese, quit smoking (she doesn't smoke!) and lost like half her size in a month. Probably 200 lbs. I want to think this is a good thing, like my brain is showing me that quitting smoking nets huge benefits. But waking up sobbing is rarely fun.

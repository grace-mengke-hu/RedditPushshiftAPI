30 Days: My Observations

Today marks 30 days without a cigarette.

I was smoking a pack a day for 20 years.  

When I quit a month ago it wasn't planned.  I just ran out of cigarettes one night and decided I wasn't going to make the 40 mile round trip drive to the nearest store.  I live in a rural area and would plan out how many cigarettes I had left to be sure I had enough for the drive to work.

There was a miscalculation and I thought I had a pack in my car the night I ran out.  Nope.  Nothing.  Getting ready for the 45 minute "run out for a pack" drive finally seemed ridiculous. It was time to quit.

I figured by morning I would change my mind and be right back to the store where the clerk would see me and pull my brand off the shelf before even saying hello.

That morning I decided since it was my day off to see how long I could go without a cigarette.  I was good for 2 days and started craving hard.  So I got the nicotine gum.  Chewed on those for the next two weeks and then started to slow down on the gum.

I still have a piece in the morning because that seems to be my vulnerable time.  This works for me so I'm going to go with it for now.

What I've noticed so far:
* Sleep was crazy.  Up and down with really weird vivid dreams
* Triggers everywhere. Best thing is to take deep breaths
* Staying away from the smoking area at work is vital- I talk to those friends in other places
* I can drive now with the windows rolled up
* OMG things taste so much better now
* When I greet people and they go in for the hug, I know I don't smell like an ashtray
*There's actually cash in my wallet
* I don't have to calculate how many cigarettes I have left until I get to a store

There's so many more things, but those stand out on month 1.

Good luck everybody and thanks for your posts.  I've lurked here for the past month and all your input has been a HUGE help.

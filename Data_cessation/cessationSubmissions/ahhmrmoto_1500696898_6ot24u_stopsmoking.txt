How to get rid of cravings in the long term?

Hi redditors!

The last time I quit smoking, I used sheer willpower to stop and I lasted for about 6 months before giving in. I learned in that time that the "3 day hump" was complete BS. 

I had cravings all day every day for the entire time and I grew more and more miserable until it got to the point where I decided the stress was going to kill me faster than the cigarettes would.

It's been a few years; I fully understand the cravings were completely mental and not physical at that point. I'm terrified of going through this again, but I'm ready to give it another shot.

How do you stop the cravings? More importantly, how do you *keep them away*?

What are some tricks you all have tried to keep your mind off of cigarettes and focused on something else?

I've been told by others to not quit *smoking*, but to instead focus on quitting *being a smoker*. How can I convince myself that I am not a smoker? I've been smoking for half of my life at this point and it's hard for me to imagine not being a smoker. How do I change who I am?

I've tried gum, patches, and non-tobacco cigarettes without success. Should I give one of these a shot again? Have any of you tried something else with more success?

Sorry for rambling. Thank you in advance for your time and advice!

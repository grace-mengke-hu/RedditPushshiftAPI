I need help from people who have actually been there.

I began the process of actually quitting last year and tried patches and it failed.

This year I started fresh with a new approach and this looks more promising because I'm dealing with the motivational factors behind why I smoke.

Yet I'm still having trouble.

I need someone who's been where I've been; someone who understands this:

* wake up, cigarette
* coffee, cigarette
* productivity, cigarette
* creativity, cigarette
* long conversation, cigarette
* mental health problem, cigarette
* beer, cigarette
* long drive, cigarette
* pretty night, cigarette

what I mean is when you're stuck between "I actually want to quit this time" but "Everything I do involves a cigarette."

I'm sick of petty websites saying 'avoid your triggers' and 'just stay busy' - bitch everything is a trigger for me and staying busy makes me want a cigarette even more!

...*deep breath*...

How do I break this woven nature between my life and a cigarette?

How do I wake up without a cigarette?

How do I accomplish a big task and not want a cigarette?

How do I enjoy life without cigarettes?

Thank you for taking the time to read.

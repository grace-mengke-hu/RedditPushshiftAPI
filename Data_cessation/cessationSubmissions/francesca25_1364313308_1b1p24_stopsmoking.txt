How can you replace cigarette time during the day?

For instance, whenever I have a cup of coffee, I organise my drinking speed so that I would end it by the time I end a cigarette. I count time in cigarettes, it is for me like a minute or a second. Or, as a 16 y.o, when my mother goes to buy groceries, I know that she`s gonna be gone for enough time for me to 2 have cigarettes.
I want to quit smoking so bad, but when I drink coffee without my smoke, it feels.. plain, I don`t even know how to drink it or enjoy it; when my mother leaves for half an hour, I feel anxious because it would have been a perfect oportunity for me to have another smoke, and I feel my homealone time is wasted if I don`t smoke.
Do you get my problem, because I feel I`m beeing incredibly incoherent? If so, any advice is welcomed.

TL;DR: Drinking coffee, being homealone for several minutes, waiting for the bus and all these activities seem too long and pointless without a cigarette. What could I replace it with?

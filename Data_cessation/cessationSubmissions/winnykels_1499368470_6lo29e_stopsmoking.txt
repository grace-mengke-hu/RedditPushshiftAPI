I've tried and failed

I never really considered smoking to be that problematic for me, but recently I've come to a realization that it is a lot harder to quit than I ever expected. Over the last few years since college, I've dabbled with smoking. I bought a pack here or there, smoked at the bar. I never thought it was something I did, I didn't identify as a smoker. To this day I still don't smoke very frequently, but it has become a daily habit. I usually smoke a hand roll after work. I stopped about three weeks ago and was successful for about two weeks, but then the fourth of July happened and I had some setbacks. Today I am starting anew and I hope I can really quit before this becomes any more problematic.

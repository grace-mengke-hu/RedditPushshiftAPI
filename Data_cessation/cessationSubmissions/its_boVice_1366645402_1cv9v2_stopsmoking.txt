These WILL be the last cigarettes...

that are ever in my hand. I've been giving it a lot of thought and I should just tell people “I quit" instead of “ I'm trying to quit," which I said a lot in past failed attempts. I believe this will help me as will increasing my workout intensity. I'm doing it cold turkey so this should be a painful week. 

I really want to go back to Las Vegas and considering I'm a pack a day smoker from North Jersey ($8.00 a pack), I will fund the trip with money saved from quitting.

How do I quit one cigarette a day?

Long story short: dipping/chewing for 4 years, escalated to about 3/4 of a tin a day. Decided to quit. Cut it back and started smoking instead to ween further. I'm at one cigarette a day but am struggling to stop completely. Any ideas or experience like this? Weening down?

Thanks.

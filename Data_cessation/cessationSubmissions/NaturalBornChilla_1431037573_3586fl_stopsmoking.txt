There go 450 days.Writing this in hopes that you don't act like me.

Hey guys,

so...450 days and a proud star go down the drain.

Last monday my dog passed away.He was a white German Shepheard.He was the love of my life and only now can i truly feel how much he meant to me.The ache i feel is primal.

I started go grab smokes since then and i can't stop using them to fill the void in my chest.I know it is not the correct way to deal with this loss but i'm just a human.

At some point i thought that smoking would be a thing of the past,i was so strong in so many moments...But at this point i feel there is always one thing that makes you so vulnerable that you start this shitty habit again.

I will not smoke forever from this point on,at least i hope i won't..but just an advice from me: If you feel as down as i do right now: Talk to a beloved one,meditate,do anything...Just let me tell you that cigarettes didn't help me.Pain is not something you can get rid off with cigarettes.

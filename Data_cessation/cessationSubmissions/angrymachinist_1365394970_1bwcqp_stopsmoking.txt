I quit smoking April 1st 2013

Actually the last cigarette I had was last Sunday night before bed. I'm using patches and gum. It's frustratingly hard and I can tell my fuse is a lot shorter. But... I already have more energy. I Feel better when I wake up in the mornings. I can smell and taste things a little better. 
Here's to forever! Cheers

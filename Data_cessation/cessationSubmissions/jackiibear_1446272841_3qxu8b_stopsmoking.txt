30 days!

Conquered this month! I have to say, even though I noticed a heightened sense of smell right away... Today was extremely noticeable. I went to a high school football game and being in the crowd with different people everywhere, I could not believe all the smells I could smell. Each person's distinct perfume, the popcorn, the grass, beer & smoke, B-O, even the air. I just thought I'd share that... Thanks everyone for your support!!! I will not smoke, not another puff, no matter what!!

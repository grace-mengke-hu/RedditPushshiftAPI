Will it really hurt?

I quit smoking 6 months ago mostly because of my girlfriend, we have some troubles in a relationship right now but i don't think we are going to break up. Im really sad tonight and I feel like a cigarette would fill my emptyness. Also I had a treated Major Anxiety Disorder and I am no longer using medication for it, I haven't slept or eaten for few days.

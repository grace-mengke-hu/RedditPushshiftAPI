Its been about a month

And I feel good. I go to the gym every day for about an hour. I have saved a ton of money and I sleep better. All of these are huge wins.

The one thing that has been nagging me lately is I do have a tightness in my lungs which I believe is normal, but I am not coughing anything up. Even after 45 minutes on the treadmill. I was a pack a day smoker for 8 years, so something should be coming up. Right?

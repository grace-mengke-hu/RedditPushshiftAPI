Tomorrow, I start again.

I decided that 2015 would be the last year I smoked. I was going to start on the first, but decided to hold off until Monday, so that I could have a better schedule for the patches I'll be using.

I've just reset my badge. Last time (1159 days ago), I think I managed a week before I succumbed and just started smoking again. I'm back up to at least a pack a day, if not two.

I'll be trying to more regularly interact with this sub, as I suspect that I will really need some support and assistance from others going through the process, as well as those who have successfully done so.

I'm also going to be installing one of those apps to help keep track and inspire myself to keep up the fight and continue making progress.

I'm ready to freaking breath again.

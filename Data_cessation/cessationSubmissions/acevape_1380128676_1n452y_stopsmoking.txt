Sad stories here and happy ones on r/electronic_cigarette

Im not hatting but Ive been checking out this sub lately and its sad to read that all you guys struggle to stop smoking. Technically ive stopped smoking but gained a vape addiction. I feel better and haven't smoked in 3 year. I urge you guys to search vape shop in yelp and find a place that can give you alittle more info. It worked for me and I hope it can do the same for you.

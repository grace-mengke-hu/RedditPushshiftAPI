Best advantage of quitting

What's your favorite advantage of quitting smoking?

Not smelling like shit, breathing better, saving money,  or what? Money isn't an issue for me, nor is social stigma, but I really just want to stop getting cold hands and feet (literally) and rid of the mental side of nicotine addiction. Overall improved health would be nice, too.

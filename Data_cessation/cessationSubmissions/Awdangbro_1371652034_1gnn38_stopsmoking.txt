Addicted to something else in cigarettes?

I have been smoking a pack a day for more than half of my entire life. I've tried just about everything to get myself to stop. Even an e-cig with the highest nicotine concentrate doesn't seem to satisfy the urge. Is it possible I could be addicted to something else that's in the cigarette? Even additive free tobacco makes me crave my usual brand. I want to quit, I just need to figure out why nothing is working, besides my willpower which I know sucks.

Thanks for taking the time to read.

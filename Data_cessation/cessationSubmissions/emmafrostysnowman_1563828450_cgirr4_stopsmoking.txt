It has been interesting so far. First 4/5days were hardest. Became easier day by day. Still not out of the woods yet, cravings are still there but not as intense as before. Haven't noticed major physical changes yet except that saliva is so white! My spit looks so clean. Color of my piss looks "clean", not sure how to express it but color is definitely different than when i was smoking. Overall feeling is of peace and relief and nervous that I don't relapse.

Also , how can't i attach my smoke free app screenshot to my post? I've attached it to Image and Video but never shows up. Sorry, not a reddit user

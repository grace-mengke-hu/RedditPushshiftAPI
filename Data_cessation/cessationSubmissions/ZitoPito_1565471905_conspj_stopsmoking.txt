am weak.

 I have tried quitting smoking so many times and failed horribly, longest I've went without smoking is 24h. To be honest, I've lost faith in my ability to do it, am ashamed and feel like a weak minded individual. However, I told myself as long as keep at it one of my attempts would stick.  

I posted a bunch of times already and when I relapse I would just remove my post coz I feel like a fraud. Today I had about 12+ cigs or more I have lost count. 

Yet, here I am again and am quitting, uhm am typing this with tears in my eyes. 

I'll try my best this time.

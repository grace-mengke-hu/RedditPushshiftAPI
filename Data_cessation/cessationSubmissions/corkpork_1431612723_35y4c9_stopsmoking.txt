30 Days and Counting. What's Helping the Most.

It takes 2 seconds to decide "Yep, I'm going to buy a pack." Those 2 seconds are precious and if you can catch yourself before 3, you're more likely to successfully divert your attention than if you let the thought of relapsing fester. I try not to focus on not smoking. Rather, if I encounter triggers or cravings I distract myself immediately. It's an instantaneous re-routing of thought I've been strengthening. 

I don't try to rationalize why I'm not smoking anymore, because if it's something I enjoyed I'm likely to "rationalize" having just one more, or thinking I'm capable of being a social smoker. 

Thinking can really get in the way of trying to achieve something as simple as not doing something, so I simply BE a non smoker. I am. I don't really need to think that over, I just go about it.

There is nothing I am or am not out side what I am in this very moment. This some how makes it simpler for me. Maybe this doesn't make sense and I'm just brainwashing myself, but my brain could use a good scrubbing.

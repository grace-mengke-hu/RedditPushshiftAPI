I failed on day one.

I'm not sure the best way to talk about it. I want some visibility so I'm making a new post instead of commenting on my post from yesterday.

I failed this morning on my way to work. I have two kids and I'm working on keeping my patience with them. I lost my cool when my 2yr old wouldn't stay still while I tried to change his diaper. I got mad and flipped him over. I immediately felt ashamed.

And that shame made me wonder if I'm even ready to stop smoking if I can't keep my cool for even 24 hours without cigarettes? I ended up buying a pack at the 711 on the way in. I'm intentionally not beating myself up, I already know that won't help anything. 

But this is still a problem! How can I be patient with my children (4, 2, one on the way) and manage my job without smoking?! I have a hard time even visualizing handling my responsibilities without the crutch of smoking.

(And if you're reading this and wondering, no I never smoke with my kids around. Only when I'm at work or in the car alone)

I suppose this is where Allen Carr's work can come in - he asserts that smoking doesn't even help the situation at all. And yet, that's such a hard idea to buy into.

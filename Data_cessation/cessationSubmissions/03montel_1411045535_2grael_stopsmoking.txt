Clean since Sept 1, 2014

In mid August my company sent out an email regarding a new change to our health care policy. A person who smoked a cigarette on or after September 1, 2014 would be considered a smoker and see an increase of $50 per month to their current coverage. After a couple days complaining about how little notice they gave us about this change I had an epiphany. I woke up on August 31th, the third and final day of a weekend spent celebrating my 29th birthday, with awful shortness of breath and an overall feeling that can only be described as "rough." I made a decision that $600 a year, in addition to the cost of cigarettes and obvious health concerns, could possibly be the dumbest thing to continue. I have not and will not look back.

I look forward to coming back to this sub for other stories.

Just passed the 72 hour mark!

And I'm feeling amazing! The nicotine is officially out of my body completely. I can't believe it but the first day was the worst and it keeps getting easier! Today was the first time I visited my family without feeling ashamed because of my smoking. I'm so happy. Thank you for all your kind and supportive words :)

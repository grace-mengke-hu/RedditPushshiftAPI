Nicotine Patches to quit dipping

I am 26 years old and I've been dipping everyday since I was about 18-19. Throughout my time, I went from dipping a whole can of long cut  a day to switching to pouches where one can lasts about 2 - 2.5 days. I've never really committed or cared to quit dipping, but now I am at a point in my life now where I want am set and determined to quit. I am interested in starting out with patches to help combat the cravings and withdrawal symptoms. 

I guess I am looking for some guidance on how to best approach this: How strong of patches should I start out with and how long should I be doing them before I get off of them completely?

Also, my understanding is that I don't need a prescription to buy these patches and I can just get them at my local Walgreens or something.

I am 17 years old and I am becoming quite dependent on smoking, I just need some experienced advice.

I am a 17 year old boy who has been on and off smoking with friends for about 6 months now. I enjoy it and I tend to smoke when I'm feeling bad or bad about myself. I am also a sporty guy and smoking doesn't help me achieve my sporting goals. All my friends smoke and I am offered all the time and when I'm feeling bad its hard not to refuse one because I just want to distract myself. I've tried quitting and I have gone without any for about 1 and a half months, but what usually happens is I feel like I've stopped for long enough to have just one, but it never works. I would just like to hear your stories and maybe some help. There's not many people who are willing to help me with this. Thank you guys

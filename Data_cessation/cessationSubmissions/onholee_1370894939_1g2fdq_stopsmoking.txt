Quitting smoking and fapping(thats w*nking for Brits) after 18 years.

So I am on around day 3. Is has been around 18 years of heavy smoking, 20 to 30 a day and have never had even one day off! Fapping - not addicted, but after some recent problems in the bedroom with "Mr Softie" ;) I'm hoping my new regime will improve things. Drinking - was thinking of giving this up but it is not really a problem, although I haven't touched a drop since stopping abusing the evil weed and bashing the bishop! SO how do I feel? Well all good up to now. The hours feel longer but not in a bad way. It feels like I have more time to do stuff and I feel my concentration span improving already. Sleeping better already and feel so much more relaxed in day to day situations. I also felt horny last night  (there is life in the old boy yet!)....I haven't had  horniness feeling for a while, so I am pleased with that. I'll keep commenting on here as I go.

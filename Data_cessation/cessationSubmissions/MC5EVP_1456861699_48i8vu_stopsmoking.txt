Last day before triple digits!

If you're having smoking problems I feel bad for you son, it's been 99 days and I haven't smoked one! Haven't posted for a while, but this sub really does help get you through the hardest times. Any time I would feel tempted in the slightest bit, I could always come here and it would go away. Good luck to all of you!

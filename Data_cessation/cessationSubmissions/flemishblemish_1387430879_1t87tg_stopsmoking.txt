Dealing with self-sabotage

Hi there. Long time lurker. Sorry in advance for any typos, I'm on my phone.
 
I've been watching this subreddit for a while and have fully committed to the idea of being a non-smoker... but have yet to make the jump into actually doing it. There is some connection that seems to be missing in my brain at this point.

I'm 24, have been smoking since 17. My SO is also a smoker, and it's part of our nightly routine to kick back with a few brews and some smokes. Its how we relax, it's a time where we recap our days and enjoy some loose conversation. I enjoy it. The smokes make it feel easier for me to relax and wind down from a hard day's work.

Problem is, I've been wanting to quit for at least a year. Every time I try, I crumble with excuses. I self-sabotage and end up feeling like shit. I know I'm doing great harm to myself but can't get over the emotional hurdle that it takes to give up. Monetary and health scares don't seem to give me the incentive I need to quit. I'm running out of ideas and am feeling like I'm at the end of my rope. Willpower is nil right now, with holidays and work stress on the horizon. It feels like I have (or give myself) every reason to keep on smoking. It's hard to see an end in sight. Whenever I try to quit, I tell myself that one cigarette will make me feel better for all the stress I'm going through, and I start to feel anxious if I tell myself I can't smoke. This just leads right back into my regular habit. Every time I light up I feel horrible, but can't convince myself to stub it out forever.

I know a lot of you have dealt with the same anxieties and self-sabotaging behaviors. I'm curious, what helped you finally take the leap, and what kept you going even in the face of mega triggers and sadness? I'm at a major loss and would do anything to get my brain and emotions on the same level. 

Thanks much, I appreciate any advice.

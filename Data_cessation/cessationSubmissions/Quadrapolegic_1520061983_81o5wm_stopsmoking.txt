1 week smoke free.

It was a tough week but worth it.    I haven't gone a week with out tobacco for about 10 years.   And smoking for a total of 16 years.  
I want to thank the folks here at stop smoking for the inspiration and help that your comments and posts have given me.   
The hardest part for me has been the habit of going outside once every few hours for a cig also before and after work.   I have been using nicotine gum and that really helps.  
Thank you so much everyone.

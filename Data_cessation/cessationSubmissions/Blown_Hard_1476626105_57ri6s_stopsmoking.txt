I feel soooo GOOD!

Thirthy days of course hasn't been easy. I have managed to avoid enough things that I haven't ruined any relationships being moody. I don't have to work right now so that has made all the difference for me.

For the past four days I have been waking up feeling a sensation in my chest that I can only describe as excitement, yet it doesnt make my heart race and ache like it used to. I am so happy I did this and this sub has been really helpful, also whyquit.com.

I quit a heavy drinknig habit around the same time and that might have something to do with feeling better as well but the feeling is in my heart and with my circulation.

This is amazing.

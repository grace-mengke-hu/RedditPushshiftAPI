Day 2 (cold turkey)

Woke up feeling better than yesterday. Still nervous and fearful wondering if this will be the attempt that sticks. I took some of y’alls advice and purchased Allen Carr’s book “the easyway yo stop smoking”... so far it’s an enjoyable read and makes a lot of logical sense in its points. Anyway, just wanted to write a post and hope that it gives me a little more accountability. Hope everyone has a wonderful day.

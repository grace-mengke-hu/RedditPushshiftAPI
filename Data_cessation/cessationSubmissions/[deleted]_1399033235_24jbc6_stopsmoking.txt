Confession

I smoked a cigarette yesterday. I only took two puffs before I realized I didn't even want it. That's a good thing, right? Regardless, I feel like my badge is a lie and it needs to be reset. It doesn't feel good that I caved and smoked, but it does feel good to confess my mistake. 

EDIT: I smoked my last one today. I don't want to do it anymore. I can't do it anymore. As hard as it was, I felt better about myself. I honestly don't know why I chose to do it again in the first place.

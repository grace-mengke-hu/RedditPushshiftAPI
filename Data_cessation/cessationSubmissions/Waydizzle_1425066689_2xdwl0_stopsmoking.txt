I don't want to smoke anymore.

But I'm definitely addicted. I'm 25, and I've been smoking for almost 11 years now. I've tried to quit before, I did the vaping thing, none of it has worked (obviously). 
My goal is to quit before March 1st. Maybe an accelerated approach will work better? I have almost a full pack currently. Should I just throw them away now, or ween myself off? Does anyone have an opinion on which option is more successful?

And how do I explain being a grouch to all of my peers, most of whom are smokers?

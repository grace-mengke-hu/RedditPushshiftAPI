What’s your Quit theme song?

Mine’s Survivor by Destiny’s Child. I actually laughed out loud the first time I listened to it after my Quit started because of how relevant it is.

Now that you're out of my life I'm so much better
You thought that I'd be weak without you but I'm stronger
You thought that I'd be broke without you but I'm richer
...
You thought that I'd be stressed without you but I'm chillin'
...
Thought I couldn't breathe without I'm inhaling
You thought I couldn't see without you perfect vision
You thought I couldn't last without you nut I'm lastin'
You thought that I would die without you but I'm livin'
...
You thought that I would self destruct but I'm still here
Even in my years to come I'm still gon be here

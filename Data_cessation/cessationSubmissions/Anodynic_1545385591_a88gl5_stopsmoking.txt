My boyfriend is about to quit smoking, how can I best support him?

Good afternoon Reddit,

So my partner as we have all noticed is an old man in comparison to me, elephant in the room. With that out of the way, he has smoked since he was a little younger than me, and goes through a pack every day or two. I've never smoked anything ever and have slightly encouraged him to quit, as it's bad for his health, but otherwise didn't really think of it too much. Additionally, a close family member of his just survived cancer and I think that made him really focus on his health.

So, he came up out of the blue and said he'd stop smoking on New Year's. I'm kind of surprised actually since I hadn't pushed it too much (just really jokes about how unhealthy it is) but proud of him for taking this step. That being said, I'm not sure how I can best support him during this time? I know he may be cranky and irritable (or so I've heard) since smoking is a stress relief. He'll be taking medicine to stop it as well as chewing anti-nicotine gum I think, but I know a large part of not smoking is by receiving support from your loved ones.

Also, I posted this first in another subreddit but I am not sure where it would best be suited and would like all of the advice I can get! :)

Pub quiz tonight and I'm bound to slip up (day 3)

Hi guys. First time posting but dam this community has helped me the past few days. Problem is me and my pals have a weekly pub quiz that we go too every Thursday night. I plan on having a bit to drink and all my friends are smokers. Every interval (5 intervals) everyone in my team goes out for a cigg. Is there anything anyone can recommend for me to do when they all go outside? Silly isn't it but I feel like it's going to trigger me wanting one especially after a few drinks

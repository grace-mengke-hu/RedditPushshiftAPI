I quit because I got a nasty cold. Days 1-4 have been smooth sailing. Day 5 I feel like jumping out of my own skin and running away from it all. HALP.

I felt fine yesterday but today I feel very... Frayed, for lack of a better word. My morning hasn't been bad, or difficult, but I feel uneasy and like I have a very short fuse. It's probably the lack of cigarettes catching up to me, but I feel crazy. I have cried twice this morning over nothing in particular. I've even thought about cutting, but not with any seriousness... I think. (Please don't judge, it's an old, BAD coping habit from my teens, over 5 years behind me. I'm confused as to why that thought even popped into my head - it's borderline intrusive).

I'm craving a distraction. I had a great evening at work last night, but today I'm back to being pissed off at everything. Through my renewed job search, I'm having a self-doubting existential crisis about whether I'll even be able to be an accountant later, since I wasn't smart enough to complete Intermediate Accounting, the class I'm withdrawing from. I'm getting worked up over something 5+ years away, over things I can't change.

I need to breathe but I feel like I'm underwater.

Sorry. Not sure how you can help with any of these random problems I just let spill out anyway. Quitting smoking is bringing everything else to a head.

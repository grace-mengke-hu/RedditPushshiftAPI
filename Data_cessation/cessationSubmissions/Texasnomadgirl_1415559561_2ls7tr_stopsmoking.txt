10 days quit. Feeling confident!

I'm 44 and have been smoking half a pack a day for the last 22 years. The most significant amount of time I've quit was for 2years for each of my pregnancies. I did quit for about 3 months a couple of years ago using Chantix but started back.

I quit this time because I started running and couldn't breathe. I'm taking Chantix again but not following the dosage recommendations. After trying to quit about a year ago with it, I had to stop taking it because it made me feel anxious and a little crazy. 

Over the last couple of months, I really started to hate the hold smoking had over me and honestly I wasn't enjoying like I always had. So one night I smoked the last cigarette in the pack and I told myself that was it. I started taking Chantix the next morning and haven't smoked since. This has been the easiest quit of my life. 

I don't crave them. I think about it when they'd fall into my schedule but it's not like a craving. I'm so excited because this is the first time I have been okay with saying "I'll never smoke another cigarette again ever" and it doesn't freak me out or make me a little sad or make me feel like I've lost part of myself I didn't want to.

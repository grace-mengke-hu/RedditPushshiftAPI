Almost had cig.

I went drinking with a buddy last night. He smokes the same brand that I used to called Camel Turkish Gold. He left his pack out, I grabbed one, savored it's fruity tobacco smell, and almost lit up. I stopped myself only just, and although I was quite drunk I realized that I would really be disappointed with myself if I went through with it.

I remembered another poster who mentioned that he'd gone a year and then faltered and made a mistake in a very similar way I was about to. I'm glad that some lessons can be learned without having to experience them yourself.

That was close!! Thanks guys.

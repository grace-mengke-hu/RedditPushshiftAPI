Day 4

Stopped cold turkey four days ago. 
Been smoking for 15 years, about 15 cigs a day.

Doing okay so far. Don't actually miss it that much right now. I've been vaping a little, but it's more because of the feeling of doing something with my hands, than because of the nicotine. Going out to buy non-nicotine fluid now.

Going out this weekend with a group of friends, all of them smokers. It's going to be tough, but I'll have to be strong and get through, cause I don't want to skip the social part of going out just because I'm dropping cigs.

2 packs a day for 5 years. Decided the cigarette I just smoked is my last

I have been smoking 2 packs a day for the last 5 years. I tried to quit a couple of times, always premeditated. Spent my 21st birthday in a fetal position shaking because I was 3 days in cold turkey.  
I just figure that its one of those things where an impulse decision is the best. No ceremony, no nothing. I smoked my last cigarette 20 minutes ago, and tomorrow should be a new me.

How long until the horrible feeling goes away? Please read my post, I would be very grateful.

I'm a little drunk, not retarded just saying, so sorry for how I'm writing. I ran out of tobacco yesterday and am going on holiday tomorrow, I'm 16 years old and I only say that because it's relevant to being able to purchase tobacco (keep referring to it like that because I smoke rolling tobacco).

Basically I have been one of those people always attracted to drugs in some way, and when I was 13 I used to smoke with friends and liked it. After this though I got sick from smoking too much and was repulsed by smoking after this.

At 15 I started vaping because I liked the feeling and it didn't taste bad, and since then have been vaping because I had an addiction, but comparable to caffeine so not too bad.

After my vape broke I decided to properly just smoke because it looked cool and because a girl I liked smoked and would comment how vaping was cringey.

But smoking is a lot more addictive than vaping although I'm not sure why. So right now I feel terrible and really want to go and buy a pack of tobacco, but I want to ask if that's a good idea and how long it will be until I don't feel this awful and can just use e cigs alone. I have an e cig right now but it isn't satisfying me the same way.

Should I buy some incase I can't cope while I'm away (3 weeks)? I'm not sure what else to say because my brain isn't working properly.

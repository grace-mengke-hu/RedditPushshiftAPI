What other method should I use?

Wellbutrin almost worked once, vaping for a month got me to quit for 6 months and nicotine gum got me through 3 days. Thoughts on where to go from here? Other methods? Wellbutrin was nice because I forgot about smoking, literally. Nictotine gum was kind of the same. Vaping was wierd, not sure why that worked but I tried it this time and it wasn't doing it for me.

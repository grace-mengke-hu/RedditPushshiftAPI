How much damage from 2 years of smoking? Can it ever be undone completely?

I began smoking around November 2012. The amount I smoked varied since then, my worst was 20 rolled tobacco a day. It went down to about 10-12 for a couple of months and then down again to 6-10 for the remainder of the period. 

I am worried about how much damage I have done to my body, particularly my lungs and throat. Smoking comes with a lot of risks and diseases, the most worrying is cancer of course. I just can't shake the thoughts I have about how damaged my lungs must be. I'm 20 y.o (18 when I started). Will my risk of cancer and other cardiovascular problems ever decrease (to that of a non-smoker) or am I doomed forever? I hate myself for picking it up in the first place and the self-blame is never ending. 

I am seeing my GP tomorrow (for something else) and I plan to discuss this with him. But for now I can't stop stressing over it.

I picked up smoking on my semester abroad and need to quit. Do you have any tips?

I know this is stupid, but I don't really know how to proceed. I'm currently in a southern European country where smoking is very common and accepted if not expected in a lot of places. I have a very addictive personality in general, and one thing led to another so here I am. 

I smoke about a pack a week now, but sometimes I'll chain smoke 10-12 cigarettes at a time if they're in front of me. I'm still in the country now, and I really need to quit. What tips can you give me? I know it was dumb to start in the first place, but here I am.

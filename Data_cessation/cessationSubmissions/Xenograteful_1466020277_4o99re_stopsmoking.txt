I got stressed out and little depressed by my birthday because I started to think about all those people I'm not in contact anymore. Nicotine addiction surfaced and made me think that a cigarette would make me feel better

I decised not to celebrate my birthday that much, partly because my work shift is at night, except by having dinner with my family tomorrow. I also started thinking I've made a lot of wrong choices this year regarding relationships with people and I'm feeling melancholic. Somehow I feel that I would able to cope with my feelings better if I smoked but that's probably the nicotine addiction speaking.

Some positive ideas about my current situation:

- This is probably the longest I've gone without a smoke for five months and I've somehow gained a bit more willpower. A month ago I would have given up already.

- I could just get my thoughts to something else until I don't feel as melancholic, preferably until I begin to sleep. This feeling will pass, and I'm gonna feel better at some point whether I smoked a cigarette or not.

- I can't have 'just one' cigarette, smoking at all would mean starting the habit all over again. Maybe the first cigarette would feel slightly good, but the good feeling would last just a few minutes at most and after that it would just be the same dull compulsive drudgery again. Smoking won't make me cope with stress better.

Gum problems

Hey guys, so I have been smoke free for nearly a week (after having a tooth extraction) and am confident in keeping it up! Just wondering if bleeding gums is common in quitters as it is worrying me a bit (I have read a couple of things online saying this could happen). Anyone here experienced gum bleeding a lot after brushing in the early days of quitting? And if so how long did it last?

To the onlooking cravers, don’t give in, and start running! Exercise really really helps and you’ll be surprised with how much you will enjoy it! Download a running app to record progress and set goals! Scenic routes help too :) 

Thanks all, hoping for some reassuring comments!

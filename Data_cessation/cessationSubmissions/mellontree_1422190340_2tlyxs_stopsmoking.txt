I fucked up.

So last night I went out drinking and smoked. I knew this would happen, and I've long thought that I will probably continue to smoke when out drinking. Today I don't want one. And I don't want to go back to it. I'm very rarely out drinking so I don't expect that this 'social smoking' will cause me problems. The thing is, I don't feel like a smoker anymore. Guess I need to reset my badge now though huh?

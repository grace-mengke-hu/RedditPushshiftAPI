Oops... Back to day 1 again.

I was 4 days in. Had a fight with my cousin, and we're back at day one again. To be honest, it wasn't even as great as I remember it. Like, yeah it was only 4 days not a life changing amount of time. But honestly, smoking isn't even that great anymore. I'm sure it'll just get easier.

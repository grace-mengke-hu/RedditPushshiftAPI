One Week Mark

I have asthma but I couldn't help myself from doing something stupid in highschool. This was my stupid thing I did. Now seven years later I've decided to quit. I felt worse and worse. I was coughing up stuff the time, waking up in the morning choking and using my asthma medication way more than I should have. My grandpa died on an oxygen tank, still smoking to his grave and I always promised myself I'd never be so stupid that I'd keep it going even though it was causing me obvious physical harm. But I was too dumb to admit I never should have been doing it in the first place.

I got sick with some sort of bacterial infection in my chest and even though I didn't really want to quit, I'm making an effort. I can't help but love smoking. It's been a crutch for me though rough times. It makes be feel good. And as uncool as I know it is, it always made me feel cool when I lit up. 

It's been a week now. It's getting easier, even though I've already gained 10lbs from stress and withdraw. My fiance smokes and we live together so it's sort difficult with him around. But it is nice to feel like I'm not putting my lungs though extra hell.

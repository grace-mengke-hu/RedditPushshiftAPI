What to do when Allen Carr's book doesn't work for you

I've read his book about 3 times, watched the video his team made and listened to his audiobook yet I'm still struggling. 

I have quit once before and in the strangest way. I woke up one day and thought am not smoking and didn't for 2 years until one drunken night. I was again hooked and been struggling ever since. 

I'm now going through periods of getting all motivated, throwing my tobacco away only to go and buy more several hours later. 

I understand Carr's book and it makes 100% sense but it just hasn't been enough for me. 

Any advice?

Day 4 is hard!

Got my earliest craving so far - 9:30am! On my way back from the supermarket with a screaming child and I wanted to smoke so much!
Silly thing is, when I was actually IN the supermarket it didn't even occur to me to buy tobacco, even though it was right there in front of me!
I should probably be pleased about that but to be honest I'm just feeling really low today, rubbish about myself, my kids, my past... Feel like everything is catching up with me ☹️

5 days in, HELP.

So some bio.

I'm 16 and in 11th grade.
I've been smoking for 4 years.
Tried to quit many times, went to ten days max.

Now it's been five days that were pretty easy, but the problem is that all my classmates, friends, and father and uncles smoke. I live in Kuwait which has a high majority of smokers from what I've seen.

So basically every social gathering, family gathering, and anything of importance will be riddled with people around me that are smoking. It's getting hard, what now?

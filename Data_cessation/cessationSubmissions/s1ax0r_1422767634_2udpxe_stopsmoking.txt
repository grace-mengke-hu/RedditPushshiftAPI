not a part of this community. not sure where to post. but this needs to be said.

I have been a cigarette smoker for 5 years 8 months and 22 days. I drank alcohol and smoked weed as a kid but when cigarettes came around, I made a promise to myself that I would not smoke until I was 18.

I have quit several times. For weeks or months. Long enough to get over the physical addiction. But it is the habitual addiction that remains. And every time, several weeks or months down the road, it took simply seeing someone else smoking a cigarette in passing that brought about the insatiable urge to smoke just one more cigarette.

Heroin addicts have said quitting heroin is not as tough as quitting tobacco. I believe that the biggest reasons are the availability and societal acceptance of smoking. It is for these reasons that I believe the time has come to make selling and consuming tobacco products illegal. As a smoker of 5 years 8 months and 22 days I ask you to help me quit by supporting the outlawing of sale and consumption of tobacco.

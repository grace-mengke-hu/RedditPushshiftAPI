Survey: Is it really easy to stop smoking?

Just curious about your experiences. Is it as easy as Allen Carr says it is? Even you haven't read his book, did you find your own quitting experience to be easy or hard once you knew for sure that you would never smoke again?

And one more question: Do you allow yourself the occasional hookah? Or does that restart the nicotine cravings and make you fell that you're never really free from nicotine?

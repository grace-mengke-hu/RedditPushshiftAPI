Questioning the decision of quitting

I have been feeling low lately. I have argued with everybody (not because of nicotine withdrawal, just me having crappy friends), and I feel like I could really use a cigarette since smokes have always been there for me. I also have this terrible muscle soreness from all the sports I've been doing, so since I am stuck at home, with nothing better to do, I am quite scared I'll light up a cigarette. Also, I have only smoked for one and a half years, so the health benefits are not so motivating to begin with, since there;s not much to repair yet..
TL;DR: I have more pros than cons to lighting up a cigarette. I'm probably gonna go ahead and give up.

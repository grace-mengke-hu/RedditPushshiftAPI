I HAVE TO but I don't WANT TO quit.

I need help.... and I need to vent. I'm currently on day 6 of not smoking and I've reached a point where I'm actually impressed by how smart my addict voice is because it keeps convincing me to bail and just smoke already. And I really want to smoke so bad. The entire problem is that I did not want to quit. That was not my will. I always knew I will want to quit before getting pregnant. I always told that to myself. That might be next year, or it might be in 5 years, nobody knows, but I've sworn to myself I will do that. Right now I'm only forced to give up smoking for almost two weeks because I had my wisdom teeth taken out and I'm not allowed to smoke. And I was ok with it until I started thinking "well, since I'm not smoking for 2 weeks anyway, I might as well quit now".

And now I'm all over the place. I'm a graphic designer, I'm a freelancer, I work a lot, my teeth hurt, my clients are crazy right now, my face is all bruised, my stomach is fucked up from all the pills.... and I really need to smoke. I really need my coping mechanism back. And I'm ashamed because I know smoking is back and I know I have to quit sooner or later but it just feels like now is not the right time. I wish I would've reached the moment when smoking feels disgusting, or reaching the moment when you have an epiphany and you want to change your life. I haven't reached that. I know I have to quit, but I just don't want to.

I'm angry, then I'm crying, I'm procrastinating, I'm struggling to work, I feel like I'm suffocating, my heart beats all over the place, the deadlines are stressing me out and all I think about the entire day is why the f\*\*k am I actually doing this to myself when I could just light one up.

P.S. I don't know if it makes any difference but I've been smoking for 7 years, something like 10 to 15 cigs a day and I'm turning 25 soon.

Need help guys

As the title says I need help guys... I've been smoking a little while now . Mostly because of stress or I just get bored (as bad as that sounds). It seems like anything that stresses me out I have the urge to smoke . Also sometimes when I drink or have nothing to do I have a urge too. What are some steps or techniques that you guys recommend? And then How do I stay consistent with those methods? Thanks

Well, after 10 years and multiple failed attempts to quit, today I threw my final pack in the trash. Please show me some encouragement.

I'm having some bad anxiety about quitting. I'm 26 and been smoking for what feels like forever. 10 years, smoking through the best and worst times of my life. I feel like I just lost a huge part of me, but I know I'll be so much happier in the long run... Speaking of run, I would also enjoy running again without having a panic attack about running. It'll be a long trip. 

Edit: you guys are the best thing I've ever had on reddit. What a great community of positivity in a world of such darkness. I just can't believe it's only day.. This was such a long day. Thank you guys for all the support.

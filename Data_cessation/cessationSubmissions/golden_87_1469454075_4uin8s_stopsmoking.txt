I'm 23 days and feeling strong but...

The last few days I've woken up feeling like I smoked a pack of cigarettes the night before. My chest feels heavy, I'm coughing, just feeling down right crappy, but not in a "I'm sick with a cold" kind of way. 

Also, I just wanted to thank those in this community. Although this is the first time I'm posting I've been using this sub as a distraction for when a craving hits. Reading posts and success stories helps the time pass and helps me get over the craving.

Hoping someone can give me an idea on when I'll start feeling better and why is this feeling just starting.

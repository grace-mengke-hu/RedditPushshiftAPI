Quitting when your partner smokes?

Hi Guys, 

So I'm almost at the end of my second week on Champix. It hasn't been too bad so far, a little bit of nausea when I take the pills, a heightened sensitivity to alcohol &amp; some crazy dreams but I'm handling it OK. Urge to smoke is drastically decreased &amp; pretty bearable. Yay! 

BUT

My main problem at the moment is the mental habit, especially around my boyfriend as he's a smoker &amp; we live together so there's cigarettes around all the time. He's "not ready to quit yet" and I respect that, but it's making it really difficult to not be tempted to have a puff or the odd smoke here &amp; there when they're just so available &amp; our routine has evolved to quite often involve cigarettes - get home from work, sit on the deck with a glass of wine, talk about our days over a cigarette, eat dinner, go outside and have a cigarette etc etc. 

I know I'll have to get over it eventually, cigarettes are always going to be around so I have to desensitise myself to it, just wondering if anybody has any advice on how to stay strong in these early days when your partner smokes &amp; there's cigs around *aaaaaaall* the time?

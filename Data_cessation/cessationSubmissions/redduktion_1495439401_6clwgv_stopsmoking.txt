A year slipped by and I barely noticed! 370 days strong, if I can do it - you DEFINITELY can.

I work in a very smoky environment, lots of friends that smoke, live in a city where you can smoke in bars. The first months of quitting were so difficult, now it has been a YEAR and I will never go back! This sub was a great pick me up to read when I was down. 

If you are reading this and doubting yourself - you got this bro/buddy/friend/bitch, you got this!

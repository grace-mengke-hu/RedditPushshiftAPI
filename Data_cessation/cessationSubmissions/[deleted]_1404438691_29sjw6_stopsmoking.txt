Stopping with those cancersticks is turning me into an alcoholic....

Hey all the brave souls who try to quit smoking,

I recently quit(about a week now) and I noticed that I became much more resistent too alcohol. It's worrying because I am currently on vacation and i have drank everyday for the past 7 days. I am enjoying a glass of wine when I am typing this. Can anyone give me some advice on how to deal with this because I don't plan on becoming an alcoholic...

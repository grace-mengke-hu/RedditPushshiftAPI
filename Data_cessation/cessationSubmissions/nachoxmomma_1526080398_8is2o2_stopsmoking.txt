I need to be held accountable by someone.

I don't even want to say the words, but I smoked. One yesterday and one just now. I had made it 19 days and then all the stress and anger of life just came crashing down. I feel terrible and like a failure but I don't want this to be a full relapse. I'm done now. I'm going to throw my pack away. I had a leftover pack from my original quit date as a "safety blanket" which I now realize was a stupid thing to do. I knew they were there and I caved.
But no more. I don't feel good. They did not make me feel any better and now it's all I can smell on me which disgusts me. 
I'm sorry for my failure, but I have improved immensely and will continue to improve from this day on.

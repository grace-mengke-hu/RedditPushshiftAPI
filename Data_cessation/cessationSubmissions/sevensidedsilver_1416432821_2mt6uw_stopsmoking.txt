Smoking In Certain Company

I'm sure someone here has experience with this.
I am committed to being 100% nicotine free and have been for nearly a year now - however, I always seem to falter when with the wrong company.
I've recognized that I can't drink anymore until I'm comfortably into my clean time. But there's just certain people that trigger me to smoke! And they give me cigarettes! I feel so strong and committed to stopping for good, and will go a couple of days or even a full week or two. 

Then I go work with my business partner and he offers me cigarettes, I've told him not to smoke around me too. I feel so weak when this happens. I'll go outside with him to continue a discussion, and just can't turn it down when its right in my face, 100% free, and being offered. 

This is my LAST and final obstacle with nicotine. Is it as simple as "just say no"? Or does someone else have a solution to help remind myself?

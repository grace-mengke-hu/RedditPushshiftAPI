It's so hard to cope!

I tried cold turkey, I've tried sucking on candy, I've tried the patch and the gum, I've tried vaping. Nothing works. I've smoked for more than half my life. It's nothing ridiculous, only about 3-5 cigarettes a day, but I don't know how to cope with my emotions without cigarettes. I'm depressed, overly emotional, and I snap at people. I don't want to be a lifer. I went 6 months without one until my vape mod broke. Got a new one and it burned the shit out of my mouth and I caved and got cigarettes. Now that I'm smoking again, I can see how badly I've been behaving the past six months. So how do I quit without being horrible to everyone around me? Am I just a nasty person?

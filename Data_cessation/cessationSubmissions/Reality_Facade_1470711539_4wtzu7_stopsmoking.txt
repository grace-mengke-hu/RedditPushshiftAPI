Whyyyyy do I feel this way??

It's been 6 weeks and the last 3 or 4 days have been almost as rough as the first week. I have no idea why but every day is a constant struggle to not give in. Today I bought some Camel Snus like a moron, and actually put a pouch in for a few minutes before spitting it out and dumping all the pouches individually into the dumpster. 


I don't want to throw away the progress I've made but fuck me I don't want to feel this way.

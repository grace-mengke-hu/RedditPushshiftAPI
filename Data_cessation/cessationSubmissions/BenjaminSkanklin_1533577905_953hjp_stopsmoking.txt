1 week smoke free tonight at 10 PM, after 15 years. Using NRT gum and the occasional douche flute. Seems too easy for the first try

I'm honestly kind of surprised at how easy this has been, aside from the first day.  Am I in for a nasty surprise when I quit the gum and e cig all together? I've made it through all the triggers and I'm still on the wagon but I feel like it has way more to do with the training wheels than my own mental fortitude.

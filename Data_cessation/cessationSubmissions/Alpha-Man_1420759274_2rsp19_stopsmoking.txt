Quitting Smoking Is EASY if you stop PMOing

Hi,

It's been 2 days since i had my last cigarette, and this forum has helped me a lot in order to Quit...Thank you Guys for the Help !

I really thought that i didn't have the power to Quit, i smoked for 3.5 years and i was smoking 2 packs a day in my 2nd year, and 1 and half pack a day this year... I actually stopped smoking many many times before, the longest Quit was 3 months ! but before i quit i found that smoking was really really hard to stop, i couldn't even stop for 2 hours and i thought that i was in prison, it was getting in the way of my life, it was destroying me, it was killing me, and the worst part is that i didn't feel i had the confidence or the courage or the energy to be able to stop again, i felt hopeless and addicted to something so bad. 

in Order to Quit Smoking, I needed to be prepared, and i mean that i had to save my energy in order to be able to really stick to my decision this time, so i remembered that not ejaculating or PMOing at all could get me the Energy i needed and that was exactly what i needed and did. Although i don't consider my self a PMO addict, but i decided that i'll never touch myself again, no porn, no orgasms, i saved my Sexual energy for only 7 days and i felt like a superman! and Stopping Smoking was easy like shit ! but i guess i directed all y energy toward this Goal: Quitting smoking. 

side effect :  I easily get angry, and i feel that my body is undergoing some changes, i feel that i have extra energy for whatever...

Sometimes I wonder if the Withrawl pangs are really bad!  in the past when i stopped smoking, i didn't feel any bad things, and this time also , i feel actually good! very very good, I was tempted by my friends to smoke hours ago, and i didn't feel any desire for cigarettes at all ! it's like the Switch is OFF! Enough is Enough.

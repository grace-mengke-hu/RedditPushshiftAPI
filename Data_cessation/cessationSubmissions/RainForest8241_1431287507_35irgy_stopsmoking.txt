Candy and snacks have helped me quit smoking

I was a heavy smoker. At first I cut down. One day I only smoked 5 and I told myself let's see how long I can go tomorrow without smoking. I did just that and noticed my appetite increased. I was craving food more and thought it was a good idea to buy a ton of candy and snacks to keep me occupied. It definitely helps out a lot. The cravings to smoke are still here I'm only on day three. If the cravings get bad I try to grab a snack or some candy. I'm not overweight and exercise so this isn't a problem. But if you are concerned with your weight this might not be the best option. 

Now let's hope I don't get addicted to sugar ;)

Quitting Vacation!

Tomorrow’s the day! Tomorrow begins my 9 day vacation and marks the umpteenth time I’ll be quitting.  I’m not going to say trying to quit, I’m saying quitting because I will succeed this time.  I’ve failed in the past because I haven’t given myself what I needed and fell prey to social triggers.  Having a set week to just put myself inside my comfort zone and be able to sleep, meditate, shower and cry through the cravings at my leisure is going to help wonders! 

I have my crafts ready, I have my movies and books and phone games and logic puzzles ready.  I’ll be picking up the candies and gum, and the packages of seeds and toothpicks I ordered off amazon tomorrow.  

I bought my last pack of cigarettes this morning and am at the same time enjoying yet hating every one I am getting through, and seriously can’t wait to kick the habit this time around!  Also excited because I haven’t taken a vacation in 6 years, so it’s going to be good knowing I don’t have to go to work tomorrow.

Also have a Kenny Loggins concert on Sunday I’m looking forward to where I’ll be surrounded with family who don’t know I’m quitting (as they don’t know I smoke), but will be a good support to keep my mind off of it.

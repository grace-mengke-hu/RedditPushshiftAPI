I could use some help/ tips to quit.

I have smoked for almost 10 years now. It was only about 5 or so cigs a day for the first 4 years, then after I joined the Army it jumped to nearly a pack a day -hurry up and wait for me meant smoke - and recently it has dropped back down to around 10 or so a night when I work, and none when I am home and not working. I work overnight security outside. I can go days without smoking if I'm off, but the minute I get to work I crave a smoke intensely. I really want to quit and I was hoping that you guys might have some tips. Please,if anyone has some advice, hook me up. I am tired of smoking but I'm struggling to quit on my own.

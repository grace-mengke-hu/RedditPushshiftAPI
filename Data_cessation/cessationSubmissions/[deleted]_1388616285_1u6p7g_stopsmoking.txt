So I think this is going to be hard.

I need to quit and I want to quit. From this day forward I don't want to smoke anymore. All that worries me is how I'm going to cope with the cravings, especially while I'm at work where I don't want to be losing focus etc.

Please tell me, what do you guys do to get through those cravings? Please don't send me to any Alan Carr material.

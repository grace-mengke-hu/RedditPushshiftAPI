Over fourteen years, and feel like starting again.

Quit in 2003, but lately the stress from.. everything.. really has me wanting to smoke. Already hitting the bottle a bit too much, and I should cut that down, instead now I feel like getting back into more bad habits.

Anyone has an idea of something that would give me the feeling I'm smoking without actually going that route?

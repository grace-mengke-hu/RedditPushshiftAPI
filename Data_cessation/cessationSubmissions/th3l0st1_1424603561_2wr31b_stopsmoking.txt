One Hundred and Eleven Days. Time to celebrate.

Obligatory milestone post. More than 3 months and now I don't smoke, don't have the craving to smoke, don't associate smoking with fun/booze/weed. And the badges make my day whenever I come to this sub. Thanks guys. It wouldn't have been possible without you.

Making Progress

It has been one month today since I have had tobacco in any form. Previously, I smoked a pack a day for 15 years. This has been much easier than I thought. All I did was read Carr's book, mental prepare myself, and quit cold turkey.

 I think the most important thing is that when I do get a craving I don't worry about it. I laugh it off, remind myself that I don't smoke (and don't want to smoke) then I go about my business.

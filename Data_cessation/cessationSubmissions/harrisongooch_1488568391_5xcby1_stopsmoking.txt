I really didnt inhale though

Long story short, i ended up taking a drag off a cigarette last night. It's been 19 months since i touched any tobacco.. i didnt inhale just drew it into my mouth like a cigar. It was easily the most disgusting thing i've tasted in 19 months. I immediately used mouthwash, didnt work just made it taste like minty ash. Got some gum on my way home, nothing. Brushed my teeth, more mouthwash. It's been over 12 hours and there is still a hint of ash in my throat... i can't believe i used to smoke at all let alone 20 cigarettes every day. It's amazing how good i thought they tasted, now that the addiction is behind me and my mouth is clean i can see then for what they are, disgusting.

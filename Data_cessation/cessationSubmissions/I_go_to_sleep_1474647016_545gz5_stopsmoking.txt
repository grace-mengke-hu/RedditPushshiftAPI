I will never smoke again III

I'm almost full five days in never smoking again.
Yes, i feel irritated time to time and the task - never ever smoke again - seems hard and too ambitious.

On the other hand - all I have to do to meet my goal is I just have to avoid one cigarette in my life. And I know I can do it. You can do it too.

Thanks for your enormous support and your stories. You are so much help.

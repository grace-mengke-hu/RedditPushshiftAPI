I have C-PTSD, I've been a smoker for 9 years and I want to quit before the summer is over

What is the best way of going about it? I really need advice. 

I want to give myself time to quit because going cold turkey with C-PTSD is almost impossible for me, but I also have a goal of quitting before the end of summer, preferably around the time of my birthday in August. I've tried cold turkey a few times and failed within the first few hours because the symptoms seem to be really severe when they're accompanied by worsening PTSD symptoms. I almost quit a few months ago, but a situation arose as I'm doing EMDR therapy, and some pretty severe traumatic memories resurfaced and I gave into smoking just short of a pack a day again. I was down to 3 cigarettes a day from 20. I also have a lot of allergies, so I can't use vape, nicotine gum, patches, to aid me in quitting.  

My fiance wants to quit as well and he has some of the same issues with PTSD, but he's had a lot more time to recover than I have, so he's having less of an issue with needing the crutch of smoking to get through difficult situations. 

Does anyone have any advice for trying to quit smoking while also having PTSD symptoms?; what worked and didn't work for you?; is there some things I can do that will supplement my mental health/physical health during my next attempt at quitting that will also tone down the major anxiety/anger symptoms? (For example: certain herbs/foods/drinks or something of that nature?) 

I'm open to any and all advice, thank you very much!

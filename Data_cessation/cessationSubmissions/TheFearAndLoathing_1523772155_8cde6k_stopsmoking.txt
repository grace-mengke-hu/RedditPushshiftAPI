48 Hours in

I don’t know how this sub feels about vaping to quit smoking, but it’s working for me after a rough day. 

Started out with a dead car battery. No big deal, buy a new one, good to go. Nope, nail in a tire. Great, now I’m late for work and need to put a donut on to get that fixed. Oops, tread on tires too low to service, guess I’m getting 4 new tires today. Wait, one of my rims is dented in a couple spots so I need a new one of those. 

I know these aren’t the most drastic inconveniences ever, but this was the second day of stopping cigs and using a vape as my resource and I’m pretty stoked to say I made it all day without cracking. 

I’m using a 6 mg juice currently. I work at a medical marijuana delivery service and I used to light up a cigarette on pretty much every drive, so like every hour. I don’t plan on staying at 6 mg too long. It’s harsh on my throat as it is and I want to drop nicotine completely. Thanks for reading all this if you did

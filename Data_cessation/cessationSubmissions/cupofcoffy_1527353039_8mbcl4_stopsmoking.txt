Am I supposed to be getting more colds after I quit?

I've been quit for ten months after smoking more than a pack a day for 30 years. I rarely get colds or flues or headaches, but since quitting I've had some sort of infection (coughing, congestion) three times. I never get headaches either and I've gotten three of those since quitting too. Is this normal after quitting?

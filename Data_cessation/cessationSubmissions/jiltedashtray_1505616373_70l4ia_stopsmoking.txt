Quitting and Anger

How bad does it get for everyone here?

I'm on my second serious quitting streak (1 week tomorrow!) but I feel like I'm having some pretty unmanageable aggression when quitting.

The first time I quit smoking lasted about a week and I have family members that still bring  it up. I figured a family vacation would be the perfect time to quit since I didn't want to break it to them that I was smoking! Turns out the close proximity coupled with withdrawals is not a good recipe.. the week can be summed up in outbursts, snide comments, sobbing, passive aggressive remarks, etc.

A few months later and I'm trying again. I feel like I'm going through the same thing. For context, I had to move back home a few months ago, I continued smoking (mainly vaping), and now I'm trying to quit while in close proximity with family. Tensions are high, they keep telling me "it's like when you tried to quit on the family trip." During one outburst I was told to start smoking again, which really fucking hurt. Not as much as what else was exchanged during the argument, but man this is fucking rough. It's like a breakup x 100. I'm hurting everyone around me.

Is anyone else like this?? Can I get a sanity check please??? Am I possibly just bipolar and it's only coming out now???

I was once told that smoking is one of the few addictive drugs that you could use and only hurt yourself. Oh my god, I want to punch that person so hard right now.

Low energy levels, anyone else?

Hey guys, I'm currently 11 days in and everything is going great. I'm feeling a lot better bar one thing: energy. I sleep a lot more and tend to get tired despite not really doing anything. This isn't that big of a deal since I'm on winter break, but I was just wondering if this is normal, and when this tends to stop. Thanks!

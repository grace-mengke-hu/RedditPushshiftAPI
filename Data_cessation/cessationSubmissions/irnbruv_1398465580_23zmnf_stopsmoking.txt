I haven't smoked since I woke up January 1st.

I think I've cracked it! Smoked for around 7 years before I quit 10-20 cigs a day.

Here's the reasons why I think it worked:

- Set 'quit smoking' as my New Years resolution, and told lots of people I was gonna do it.

- Got really drunk NYE and knew smoking would make me feel worse on the first.
- Mum said she'd give me Â£100 on the first of Jan 2015 if I hadn't smoked by then.
- Girlfriend was very supportive and I didn't want to disappoint her.
- Did long shifts for the first week.
- Took it one day at a time.
- Downloaded 'Smoke Free' App.
- Posted milestones on Facebook.

It really does get easier every day, and I don't worry now if I go out or am around people smoking, because I know i have the power to not smoke. Good luck everyone!

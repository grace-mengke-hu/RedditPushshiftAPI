Staying off nicotine in a time of high stress

I quit nicotine on June 1st, so have 20 days with only a couple puffs of a friends vape. I’m very happy with this, but my girlfriend is currently in the ER with the effects of an ongoing medical problem and I’m very stressed. All I want is a cigarette.

What do you guys recommend to do in times of very high emotional stress instead of smoking?

One week in, third time quitting, and I just don't feel myself

I can't concentrate on anything for more than a few minutes at a time. I'm constantly hungry but also have a sensitive stomach. I drink too much coffee then drink too much green tea to calm down. I feel like I'm boiling water for either coffee or tea all day and night! 

I think I'm going mad. 

To top it all off, I'm starting a new year of grad school this week. Will I be able to get my work done? Will this ever get better? 

I just want my addictive stimulant back :(

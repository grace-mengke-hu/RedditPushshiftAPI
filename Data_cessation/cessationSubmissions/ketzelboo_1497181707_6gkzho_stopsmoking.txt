Tomorrow is the day

I have been stuck in a relapse-loop for 3 years now. Made it a couple of months, slipped, smoked for a couple of months, quit, slipped ...am really annoyed with myself. I didn't smoke the first three months of 2017 and it wasn't even difficult, eventhough my husband continued to smoke. Relapsed when something stressful happened.
Anxiety really is my biggest weakness, overall and in relation to smoking. But recently I've made some progress and it seems easier to not let anxiety take over my brain. I'm in a really good place rightnow, everything is going fine, smoking is the only problem I have. So let's get rid of this problem. I know stressful moments will come, shit will happen, but I'm positive that this is the right moment to stop this lame half-arsed attitude towards quitting and selflove.

I've quit so often, I know I'll be fine after a couple of days. Withdrawl symptoms aren't the problem, cheating on myself is. So, as of tomorrow no more cigarettes, no more excuses ...

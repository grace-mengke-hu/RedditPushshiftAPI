Quit somewhere in April, need some place to vent or I am going to buy a pack.

after a lot, and I mean a lot of soul searching, I truly believe that nowadays only self-punishing persons smoke. I started late, in my 30s, have stopped twice, longest time, what the hell, does it matter? 

My pulsion for smoking is certainly masochistic, I want to punish myself, I know it's not pleasurable, I know how shitty it is, I know how it pisses everyone around me, and that makes it even more entertaining... why the hell do I have such desires? why I have to have a "I want the world burned down" feeling? 
I am an alcoholic too, can't manage a couple of days without a 12 pack. If I read the news, ww3 and all hell will break loose at any given time. I am not sure this is the right spot to submit this, but I want to smoke and I am not falling for it this time.

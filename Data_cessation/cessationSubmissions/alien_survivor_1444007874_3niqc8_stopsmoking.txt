Two months clean and my new meds are making me crave a cig badly... I asked my ex wife for just one and thankfully she did not give me one

I am on some sort of anti anxiety anti depression medication and I have been taking it again for like four days and it has revved up my gears and made me want to smoke sooo fucking bad. I do not understand it at all.  It sucks

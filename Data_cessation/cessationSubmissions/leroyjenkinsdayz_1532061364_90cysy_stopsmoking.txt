Question about smoking joints

Started mixing my weed with tobacco about a year and a half ago, started smoking cigarettes alongside that about 5 months ago, decided to quit all tobacco 2 days ago.  Will smoking weed joints impair my lungs’ ability to heal and expel tar? I’ve found smoking a joint satisfies my urge to smoke something and being high helps me resist the nicotine cravings, but I’d rather not risk prolonged negative health effects.

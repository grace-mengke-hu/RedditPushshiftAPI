Willpower

It has been 16 days since my last one. It's hard to believe but feels great, my fianc√© smokes and had left one sitting out today. I stared at it for a minute, then walked away, then came back again. But then I remembered I don't have that dusty feeling in my throat anymore or the nicotine stains on my fingers. It helps to remind myself all the things I got rid of once I quit. It's still hard but getting easier everyday. Good luck everyone!

Need some help

Ok so I failed at quitting but the willingness to is still strong. I smoked while wearing the patch for almost 4 weeks and yesterday I think I over did it and got nicotine poisoning. I had all the symptoms the queezyness, nervousness, confusion. So this morning I didn't apply the patch nor did I take any  Wellbutrin. When I try to throw the cigarets away and just use the patch I seem to go into a panic attack. So has anyone else here had such problems ? What does one do when so addicted to smoking and no matter how many times I try I cannot seem to quit. Any advise will be ever so appreciated. With my thanks, Gary

It's getting rough. Only 5 days in.

I'm dealing with the cravings but they seem to be getting really intense. I saw a lady smoking on her break yesterday and I was jealous. The smell was too familiar. Sometimes I think just one more, but I know that doesn't work. I'm so tired too. Coffee doesn't seem to be as good without one either.

This is really harder than I thought.

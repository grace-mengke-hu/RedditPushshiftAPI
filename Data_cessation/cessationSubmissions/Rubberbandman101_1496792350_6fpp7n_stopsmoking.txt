Fellow Redditors, i need tips on quitting smoking -Cold turkey

Hi guys, i've been smoking for 2 years and i'm 18. Right from the get go of my addiction i started smoking a pack a day. It was so fun back then, but now i feel like a slave. I feel like every-time i smoke one my insides are turning rotten. I'm really tired of this habit, i really don't find no joy in it anymore. I was wondering if you guys can give me tips on how to quit cold turkey and stick through it. AND yes i've read the Allen Carr book but it don't have any effect on me. I'm really sick of this poison, but without it i don't feel good and with it i don't feel good. Ya feel me ?

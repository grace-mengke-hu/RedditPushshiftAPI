90 days cold turkey.

I can't believe it's been 90 days already and I can't wait to hit a year. The first time I quit smoking it took me about 9-10 months to completely forget about cigs after smoking a pack a day for 6 years. I must say I've definitely had my ups and downs. My depression and anxiety is so back and forth it's ridiculous but it's still not as bad as it was right before I quit. I honestly think smoking really affects depression and anxiety and can make it worse. Since I've quit I feel better but I still feel like I'm stuck in a rut. If i remember correctly it took me about a year to completely get over my anxiety and depression the first time but I made it through. Quitting smoking is like breaking up with your girlfriend of 5 years that you were totally in love with. You struggle for however long and as time goes on you slowly getting over her and then finally come to a point to where you could care less about seeing her with someone else. These last 90 days have been something else but I can see and feel myself getting better each week that goes by. Stay strong out there fellow quitters, it's worth every struggle at the end!

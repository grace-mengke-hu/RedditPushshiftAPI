Beginner's inquiry. The little changes from quitting smoking. 

I'm prepping myself mentally to become a non-smoker. Not quit smoking, just don't smoke. 

I know it's a subject that is beaten to death, but I think it's one of the biggest motivations. What are some of the subtle (or not so subtle) changes and different experiences you went through as you made your journey to a nicotine free person?

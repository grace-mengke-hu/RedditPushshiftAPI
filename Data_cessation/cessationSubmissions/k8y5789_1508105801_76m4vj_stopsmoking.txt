Gradual or all at once?

Okay, I'm a 20 a day smoker and have been for 12 years now. I know I'm thoroughly addicted, to the point where having a cigarette is the first thing I do when I wake up, every morning. It's time though. I need to quit! Here's my dilemma... should I cut down gradually over the next few weeks, so it's not such a shock to the system? Or should I just go for it?

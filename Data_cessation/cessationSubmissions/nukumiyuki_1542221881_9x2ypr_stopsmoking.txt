How do you even quit?

I don't even smoke that much (about 10 a day for the last 3 years or so, a lot less for a long time before that and wasn't I proud I never really liked it and probably won't ever get addicted? Yeah...) 

Whenever I try to quit after a few hours I feel antsy and nervous and unhappy and even though I know that smoking will only keep the addiction going and after a week or so it's probably going to get better I feel like I can't think about anything else nor concentrate on what I'm supposed to do, then I tell myself that I will try again at some better time and of course there is never a better time. 

I've tried watching motivational videos on how to quit smoking and reading that book of Allen Carr that's rumored to be able to help smokers to quit, but it didn't work either. I've heard of hypnosis as a way to quit? But also feel ashamed that it's so hard for me to do this by myself... 

What do you do that helps you to not smoke? Do you replace the habit of smoking after a meal or before going to bed with anything else? If you want to take a short break from working what do you do apart from smoking? Does anybody live in a country where smoking is still social and about half or at least a third of your colleagues smoke? What is a good way to get to know your colleagues especially when you've got a new job?

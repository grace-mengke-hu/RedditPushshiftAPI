2 years - Thank YOU

I have not been the most active member of this group but this community has been there for me everytime I needed some support. I turned to you at different points of the day or night and always found some inspiring stories, good advice, links to useful material... The amount of knowledge that all of you have put together over the years is really unvaluable and helped me tones to get where I am today.

I am **2 YEARS** smoke-free and I can say that was one of the biggest turning moments in my life. Not once I have looked back thinking:
> *"oh! I miss those mornings when I would wake up with a bad throat! How wonderful was when my hair and clothes stunk! How much fun was it wandering the streets under the rain looking where to buy cigarettes at 3 am"*


My life is so much **BETTER** in so many ways. And **YOU** are all part of that success. 

A **BIG THANKS**, I will be toasting for you today!

I really didn't think I could do it. But today is day two.

I posted here not too long ago expressing my total defeat. I thought I couldn't quit. I was depressed coupled with a shit job. 

I started my new job yesterday and haven't touched a cig since. Maybe its the social pressures that got me into it. But now for the better its the social pressures that got me out. I can say even though I didn't respond to everyone I spent the day reading everyone's responses every time I craved a cig. Thank you for this community. I know I have a long journey ahead of me but you guys really help make it a bit easier!

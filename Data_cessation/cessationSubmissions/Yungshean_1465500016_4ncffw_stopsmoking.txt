Slipped Up, Question?

It's been about 38 days since i've smoked. I've smoked four recently over the past four days. I don't have the dependency anymore but when I drink I'm likely smoke. So my question is should I reset my quit date or should I have more self control in the future, and treat it as if I still haven't smoked. (FYI) I used to smoke about half a pack a day for three and a half years. 21 years old currently.

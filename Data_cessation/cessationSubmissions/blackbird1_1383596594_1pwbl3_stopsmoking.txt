Practice makes perfect

In yoga, sometimes we flow. That's going through a series of poses in a specific order with a specific rhythm. Sometimes we hold poses. And them there's true hatha, which consists of holding a pose without moving for at least 5 minutes. Even the most comfortable and restful of poses can be horrifically excruciating after 4:30. 

In that moment, when you desperately want to give up and just put your effing leg/arm/hip down, or whatever it may be, we are encouraged to look inward. To find what we can learn about ourselves when we hold straight, when we most want I bend. To stay strong, when we are feeling our weakest. It is a exercise in not just will power, but in finding calmness within the mind when the external world is shouting its loudest. It's not just about distraction, but about peace.

What a great tool for those of us dealing with competing interests and forces. One part of the brain says smoke, another part says don't. How do you silence one and not the other? How do you ignore your own needs?

You practice. Sometimes you fall to the mat. You do it again.

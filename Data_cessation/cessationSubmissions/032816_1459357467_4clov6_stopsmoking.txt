Metabolism

I am on Day 3. Fended off some early morning cravings and instead worked out for a bit. I feels like my metabolism has slowed down the last few days.. I am not as as regular as I used to be :-)

I am eating better than before, and 8 drinking glasses of water every day. Anyone have suggestion on to counteract it..

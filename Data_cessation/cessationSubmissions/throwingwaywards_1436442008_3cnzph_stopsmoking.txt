I quit smoking with Champix. But the side effects?

I was a pack a day smoker for about 2 years. It was really a stress thing as I was running my own business, and had some money problems. eventually I used Champix to quit. Around the time of quitting, I also sold an investment property, which solved my money problems.

Ok but now the side effects. Since Champix the following has happened:

- I have given up on my business, and ruined my goodwill with about 15 clients just by not showing up for jobs.
- I sleep until about 3pm every day.
- I have stopped playing sport.
- I would say I am really depressed, often have suicidal thoughts, but I could never actually kill myself tho, as I have a wife, large family and I couldn't do that to them.
- When I wake up (at 3pm) I generally just sit on the computer all night. Often I stay up until the next morning, sometimes I just don't sleep.
- I have no eating/meals routine, and have lost a bit of weight.
- My wife and I were trying to have a baby before all this started, and quitting smoking was part of the reason with this. since Champix I have had no sex drive or motivation in general.


So is it Champix that has caused all this? How the f*** do I get out of the routine? My wife says I should just get a new job and see if that helps, but I really feel like I couldn't even hold one right at this point. has anyone else had similar experiences with Champix or when you quit smoking, how did you deal with it?

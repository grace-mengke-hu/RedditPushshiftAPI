It's been about a month and I'm doing well but...

today I was overcome with a most intense cigarette craving. I drank water and chewed  gum but Jee-ZUS! Will it always be this way? I wasn't especially stressed but I *had* just lunched, which is the smoke I found hardest to give up when I stopped. I'm avoiding alcohol this weekend so I don't relapse. Strength!

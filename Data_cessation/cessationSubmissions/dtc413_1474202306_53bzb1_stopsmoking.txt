I about caved last night...

Tomorrow will be a week with no cigarettes.  I chose a shitty week to try to stop, since I mostly smoked to deal with stress and anxiety, both of which have been a struggle this week.  Last night was the hardest, I was at small party, had a few drinks and my cravings ramped up.  Then Igor a few texts that got me thinking about my ex and how I'm alone and all that shit and I really had to fight the urge to not smoke.  I think it helped that I had a close friend at the party who knows I'm trying to stop, so part of me didn't want to disappoint them.  It's so hard this morning though not to go buy a pack....

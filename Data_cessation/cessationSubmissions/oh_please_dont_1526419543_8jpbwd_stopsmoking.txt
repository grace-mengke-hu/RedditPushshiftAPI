I'm still here, and so are you, yay to us!

This place helps me a lot when sometimes still cravings come. I just go here and lurk a bit and read about some of your experiences. Shortly after, i forgot that i had a craving. Thanks, i guess!

I'm still on the gum, but hey- usually no more than one or two per day, and yesterday i even forgot completely. It helps me thru times when the cravings get hotter. I know the physiology is so that i should probably kick that too... Maybe i'll just forget i need them someday.

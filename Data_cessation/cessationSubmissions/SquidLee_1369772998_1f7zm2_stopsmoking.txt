Here's to the rest of my Life

I lost my dad to lung cancer in 2011, my mom was recently diagnosed w lymphoma (though she never smoked; cancer runs on her side of the family) and after a surgery and chemo and such, she's doing well.  I have felt the most guilt for my smoking since my father passed. I decided to quit today and am excited. I can't wait to see what the rest of my life will be without that crutch.

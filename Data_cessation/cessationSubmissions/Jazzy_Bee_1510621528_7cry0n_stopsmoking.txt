Over a month as a non-smoker

Yippee for me.  I've smoked more than 40 years, with multiple health issues related to it.  I'm using nicotine replacement, and no plans to change that anytime soon.  I was unprepared for the surges in urges after a few weeks, it's more than nicotine habit with smoking.

I'm here because it's a tough day, but one I got through with a little extra nicotine spray and more puffs on the e-cig.

Quitting Nicotine Replacement Therapy is Hard Too!

After 17 years of smoking I replaced cigs with nicotine gum approximatley 16 years ago.  I gave up the gum on 1/1/15.  I have withdrawals just the same: very irritable, constantly craving both nicotine and food, miserable.  And I can't seem to think about anything besides wanting time to pass so the cravings and low mood do too.
I'm begining to wonder if, under the nicotine, I'm just a very impatient, none too pleasant person!  Does any one else feel like this?  Anyone??!

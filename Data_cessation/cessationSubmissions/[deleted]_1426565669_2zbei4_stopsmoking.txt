Bombarded with cravings these last few days...

Like a ninja, I kicked each one of them flat to the ground. I have been so stressed lately. There is so much going on in my life that I feel like I am bursting at the seams. So many times I thought I would cave and smoke. I actually thought about how I could get just one. Just one. I did not want a whole pack. Just one. But I fought through. I kicked those cravings in the crotch! A little advice for those who are just starting: Don't give up. Fight it! You awesome ninja! It will get better!

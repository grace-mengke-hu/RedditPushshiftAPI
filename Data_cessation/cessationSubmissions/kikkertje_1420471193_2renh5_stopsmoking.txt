Day 4 - My experiences so far

I am (was?) quite a heavy smoker, 2 packs a day (4) and 36-years old now. I had countless attempts to quit, but none of them stuck so far. January 1st before going to bed I smoked my last cigarette and haven't touched one since. Three days might sound like a little, but boy it was heavy. My girlfriend quit as well, and the house is as grumpy as you can imagine, luckily enough we both realise full well that it's the cigarettes turning us into little monsters. Eating has been non-stop for the last 72 hours, but who cares about that, I'd rather go on a diet than having to endure the annoyance of quitting smoking again.

Today I went to the gym for the first time in months, pretty stoked about that, and started on a running program, lungs and body felt pretty solid throughout, all in all I'm pretty positive it'll stick this time.

Just felt like sharing! Good luck everyone going through the same!

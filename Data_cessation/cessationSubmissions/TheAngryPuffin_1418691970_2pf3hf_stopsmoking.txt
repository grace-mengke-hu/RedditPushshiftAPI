Spent my 100th day ironically

100 days in, cravings have virtually disappeared (99.9%) although I know there'll be future occurrences and I'm prepared for them. Spent my evening celebrating at a Irish traditional music event where there was smoking inside... the opportunity to smoke didn't interest me in the slightest and even had to completely change into new clothes when I got back as I couldn't stand the smell!

Stop smoking, find something to occupy yourself (whatever the hell you like, at least it has to be better than smoking) and have little reminders for you to look back on and consider your journey i.e. smoking phone app, progress tracker in /r/stopsmoking

Wish you all luck with your efforts :-)

Even when times get tough...

Keep going! I quit smoking in January, not really knowing how long I'd last. As it turns out, this year has been rough for me. Two pets, two grandparents, and my stepmom have all died in 2015. There have been so many times when I've just wanted a cigarette-- after funerals, crying sessions, etc. Especially because lots of my family members are chain-smoking chimneys. But I remember something a clerk at a 7/11 once said to me when I was buying a pack. He asked why I was smoked and I said things were stressful. He told me, "things will always be stressful--it's never a good time to quit. Someone will always die, someone will always be in the hospital, someone will always break up. At some point you just have to stop."

I never imagined I'd get through the past 8 months cigarette-free, but sometimes it's a matter of taking it hour-by-hour. Don't give up!

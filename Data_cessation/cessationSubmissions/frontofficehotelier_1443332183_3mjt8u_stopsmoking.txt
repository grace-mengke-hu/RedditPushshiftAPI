Former chef, current smoker, need help

I cooked for ten years starting when I was 14. Anyone in the food industry will know how prevalent it is. I started smoking when I was 16, I'm about to turn 25. I have tried to quit using patches, chantix, and the best I have done is 3 months quitting cold turkey.

I want to be done with it but old habits die hard. I need help/ motivation. Any kind words and advice would be lovely

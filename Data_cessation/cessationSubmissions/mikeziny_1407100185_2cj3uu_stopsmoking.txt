Lung "tension" while active (running)

Hello r/stopsmoking!

First of all i'd like to say: Hell yeah! I'm free for 105 days now =)

But i have a question. I might go see the doc about it, but first i'll ask here if anyone is facing same problems.

I smoked a lot (pack a day) a while ago and i did work out while smoking. Sometimes while running i had that strange "tension - like someting is burning in my chest" feeling in my loungs. I figured it was from smoking and did not concern myself as much as i should...

But now i am a non smoker for 105 days and i still run (4 or more times a week) and from time to time i still get that feeling in my loungs. It occurs only when running, starting after 10 min in and lasting sometimes for a short time, sometimes until i am done runnig.
I do not have any problems anyhow, it's just the feeling that bothers me... 

Does anyone know what could it be? Could it be my loung cleaning themselves after 4-5 years of smoking? 
Should i go see a doctor about it?


Thank you for you help, it was this subreddit that helped me stop and i really love to check my badge daily.

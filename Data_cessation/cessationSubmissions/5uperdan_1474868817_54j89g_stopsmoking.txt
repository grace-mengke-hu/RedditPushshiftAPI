Denial is a crazy thing.

So my badge must say over a year now. Sadly it's not true. I'll reset it when I work out how. Gave up last year for a good 8 months. Then I had a few drinks one night and almost dared myself to smoke. One led to two and before I knew it I was smoking a pack every time I had a drink. I still wouldn't admit to myself that I was smoking. For the last month or so I've been smoking 20 a day. All sorts of feelings have been going on; shame, weakness, anger etc. 
I was so so hungover yesterday that I couldn't smoke, so I figured if I can do one day then I can do another one. 
I liked being a non-smoker. I'm looking forward to being one again. Good luck to anybody quitting and remember, 'just the one' is never just one.

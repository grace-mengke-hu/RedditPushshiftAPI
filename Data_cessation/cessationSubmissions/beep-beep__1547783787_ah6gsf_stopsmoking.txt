Thoughts on the best nicotine replacement?

I want to quit, but a big part of me is afraid. My smoking has been a crutch for my anxiety for the four years I've smoked. (Not as long as some, I know.) The last time I went cold turkey I suffered horrible fits of anxiety and do not want to face nicotine withdrawal boldly like that again. If anyone has any reccomendations, pros/cons of different substitution and weaning methods and just any advice I'm open to most anything

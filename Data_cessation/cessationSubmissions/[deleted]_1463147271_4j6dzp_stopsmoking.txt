Cutting down/out on caffeine is working for me.

Some of you out there are probably caffeine junkies like me, I always associated coffee and cigarettes together as a way to kickstart the day and would proceed to consume a further 4-8 cups throughout the day. 

Not only was this bad for me in a habitual sense of linking the two patterns of behaviour, but caffeine as a drug can increase your heart rate, make you anxious, in turn you crave the sedative effect of nicotine, the stimulant nature of caffeine can make you obsess about getting that nicotine fix. Not only that but it would effect getting a good nights sleep, the caffeine created an insomnia effect and in turn I'd have a cigarette to relax.

This time quitting I've completely cut out coffee from my diet and it's working. Instead of having a coffee and cigarette in the morning I'm lifting weights and then having a shower. It gets the blood flowing in a far more natural way and I feel energized. It's taken me years to realise how much of an effect caffeine had on my behaviour.


Maybe all of this was obvious to some people, maybe it doesn't apply to you or maybe you're thinking there's no fucking way you'd give up caffeine as well as cigarettes, but if you're a serial relapser like I was, it's worth a shot right?

Good luck everyone.

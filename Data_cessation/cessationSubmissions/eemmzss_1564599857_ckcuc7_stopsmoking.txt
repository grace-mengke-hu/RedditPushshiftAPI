How many tries did it take for you to quit?

I've tried a few times but so far I've always talked myself back into buying another pack and starting all over again.
I've taken a week off work and starting tomorrow afternoon I'm going to do my own diy smoking rehab at home.

I would love some encouragement if it's taken of you multiple tries to get out of this awful addiction

Advice is also very welcome, how you did it differently when you finally finished it for good.

Last but not least, thank you all for this sub! It's helped me get further than before and I do appreciate it. I know I will make it eventually, because I see so many of you doing it

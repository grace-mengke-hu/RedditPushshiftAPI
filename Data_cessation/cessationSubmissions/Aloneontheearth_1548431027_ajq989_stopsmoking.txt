Got 3 days

I finally got 3 days without a cigarette. I smoked for 4 years when I was younger and then quit for 5. I picked it back up about 8 or 9 months ago after a bad breakup and found that it was even harder to quit now than before. I tried the patch, gum, lozenges and cold turkey, but I finally found what works for me. I have gone cold turkey with one lozenge per day so that I can go to sleep without withdrawal symptoms. Soon I will eliminate that one lozenge and get myself to be entirely nicotine free. I know it is a mental game from here on out, but I am proud of myself for being able to give it up even for a few days. I won't go back to smoking this time. Being able to breath is worth quitting for.

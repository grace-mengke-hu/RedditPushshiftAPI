Meta: Keep advertising off the sub

I've only noticed 2 posts so far, but it's enough to concern me. What's more annoying is they're both for electronic cigarettes, it makes me feel like a dick for being one of the big advocates for accepting them as a legitimate tool to help people quit, but that's beside the point.

Cessation aids are big business and I'd hate to have to sift through post after post of advertising to get to the posts that matter, helping individuals quit smoking.

I'm not a mod, so I have no power to enact anything. But I think the simplest solution would be to ban direct links to stores. Recommend books or products all day, but avoid links that benefit one seller over another.

I dunno, just my idea of the moment. I'd like to know what the rest of the community thinks of it.

Recently started Chantix

I just discovered this sub so don't mind me if this is just another ramble but I started Chantix 24 days ago after smoking for 13 years. I continued to have cravings for about 4 days. After that, The cravings stopped and I can say I've been cigarette free for 24 days and craving free for 20 days with Chantix. After so many failed attempts to quit, I feel this is finally the end. Anyone else have such great success with Chantix?

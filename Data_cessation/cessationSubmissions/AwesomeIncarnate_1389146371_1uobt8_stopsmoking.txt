New Years Resolution was to quit am on day 7 now. Boyfriend has unfortunately caved. Help!

My boyfriend and I decided our New Years Resolution together would be to quit.  We both started smoking around the same age but he was a heavier smoker than I was.  He was a pack a day man and I was a pack a week woman.  So far I feel like I'm doing well.  As long as I keep myself busy I don't have any urges or cravings.  I quit cold turkey.  For him we got him the Nicoderm stage 2 patches and he's caved once.  I'm trying to be really supportive of him and he says the fact that I also quit helps but I'm not sure what else to do to keep him from caving.  He also used to be addicted to Vicodin and he's been clean for a year.  I know if he can quit drugs and drinking he can quit smoking permanently.  Any thoughts or ideas?  Thanks guys!

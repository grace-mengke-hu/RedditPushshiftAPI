A (selfish) request for help...

The reason I feel selfish making this request is: I haven't really been around on the board much lately, which means I haven't really been helping anyone else (which I feel sort of guilty about). But maybe this post will help somebody. 

Long story short, today is Day 48, and I'm craving like it's Day 9 or 10 (for some reason, those were the worst days for me). I'm anxious as HELL, and my brain is SCREAMING at me that smoking a cigarette will make me feel better. 

Rationally, I know this is nonsense. But emotionally, I feel like a baby screaming for his Mommy. 

Anyways, just needed to get that out. 

Thanks in advance for your help and support. And to those with fewer days than me, don't lost heart: you can and will get through this.

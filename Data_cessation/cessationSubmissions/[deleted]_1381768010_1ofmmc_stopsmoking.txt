My last cigarette

I remember my last cigarette vividly. It was a warm evening with birds singing in the nearby trees. I laid back on a cozy lawn chair and lit up the last cigarette I would ever smoke. Carefully inhaled every bit of smoke and enjoyed the nicotine flowing through me. It was a perfect moment that I thought of as the beginning of a new smoke-free life.

Few days later I bought a new pack.

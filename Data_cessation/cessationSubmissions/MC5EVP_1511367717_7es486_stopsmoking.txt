2 years

It has been 2 years officially! The first few days and weeks I was on this sub 50 times a day lol. Thank you to everyone who was supportive and gave advice to me, or anyone else trying to quit. It is a tough habit to break, and I couldn't be happier that I stopped. Stay strong over the holidays and look for reasons not to smoke instead of reasons to smoke. Have a great Thanksgiving and be safe!

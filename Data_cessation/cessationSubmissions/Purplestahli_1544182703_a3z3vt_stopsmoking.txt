Best way to ween off of NRT?

I've been a casual smoker for almost 10 years, just last week I decided to put my foot down and quit for good. I picked up a 160 count pack of Nicorette because I knew there was no way I was gonna make it cold turkey. Its been going very well so far, I have 3-4 pieces a day and I have had 0 cravings to light up. Its all well and good on the surface but I have this nagging fear that once Im out of gum ill just relapse into smoking again or feel compelled to buy more gum. I really want to cut my nicotine dependence out all together because its taken a hold of my mood stability. Does anyone who has done NRT have any tips for gradually weening themselves off nicotine dependence all together?

Blood in nose after I quit smoking.

I quit 13 days ago. I have never had an issue with getting a bloody nose just the occasional sinus infection. In the past 10 days, mainly the right nostril has a constant stream of bloody boogies. I never had this before but it is right in line with quitting.

Did anyone else have this issue and know why this is happening?

Other than that I am breathing easier and my lung capacity is up by 50% (yes I measured this) my cardio workouts are easy now and I have been able to double my distance in the same amount of time. I am able to do more reps/sets in my strength training.

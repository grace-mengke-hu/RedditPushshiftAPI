Second Attempt at Quitting!!

I have been smoking 4-5 cigs a day for the past 7 years.. I quit for a good 8 months in the middle and then started again to cope up with family drama and stress.. I have realized that these stupid cigs don't help in managing anything.. 
So here goes my second Attempt.. it's my second day today.. 
Hoping that this group helps to quit the most useless invention of mankind!!
P.S. I often think how aliens would react to someone smoking..

Day three? On Friday, March 1 at 6:45 AM, I extinguished my last cigarette! However, that day I had Nicotine Gum. Around 3:00 PM that day, I had my last piece of gum. Now, I want to throat punch everyone back to the womb!! I am trying to quit since my wife had to for her disability. But I might die!

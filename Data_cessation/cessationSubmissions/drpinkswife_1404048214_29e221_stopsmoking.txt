Yeah OK this book is starting to make sense....

I imagine myself before I ever started smoking. Healthy, muscular (played tennis and other sports), fearless; maybe not wildly happy, maybe confused, but I was a teenager. Who isn't a little confused then? I remember that first smoke and I remember it was disgusting, vile and smelled gross. I know I have nothing but good things to gain by staying a non-smoker and yet I still fear failure. So just thought I'd put that out there. Anyway, I'm not going to fail today. Nope.

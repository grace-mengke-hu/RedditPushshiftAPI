The first week of the rest of my life

I made it one whole week 15 minutes ago. I have been taking chantix non-regularly but I haven’t vaped or dipped or snuck a puff from anyone. Every day I drive home and think about buying a pack, or just bumming one from a smoking friend. But I haven’t... I haven’t taken in any nicotine in a whole week but it’s not getting easier. I’ve got this! Thanks for your help /r/stopsmoking!

I need some help. I'm having trouble quitting completely

Right now I am going through a pretty stressful period.  I need to figure out something to help divert myself from smoking when I get stressed.  I smoke maybe twice a week (down from 3-4 a day two months ago), but I am having trouble going completely smoke free.  Sometimes I will go a week or so, but something comes up and I feel the psychological need to smoke.  I have trouble resisting the urge to have "just one".  I need help getting to where I need to be.  

My boyfriend has been supportive, but he is going through his own stressful period, and is having some difficulty quitting himself.

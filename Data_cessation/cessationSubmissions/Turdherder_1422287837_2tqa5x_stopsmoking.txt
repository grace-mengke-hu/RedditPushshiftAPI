After 6 years i'm ready to turn my back on nicotene.

I started smoking when I was 16.  After a couple years I was up to a pack a day.  I started chewing in college and haven't stopped since.  I woke up this morning and realized I had no control anymore.  I've taken massive strides to improve my health over the last 4 months, losing weight and lifting but I still haven't improved in one area.  I chew every day and smoke every weekend. 


Tonight I'll have my last dip and wake up ready for a new day tomorrow.  I gain nothing from nicotine and it's time to start acting like it.

My lungs are hurting, and that's a good thing!

I have just quit, and my lungs are quite painful and I have to cough a lot. Presuming this just goes over (of course it will), I  am actually happy that I get this, because I don't have the tendency to smoke now and this can get me through my first week or two.

Also, I am exercising every day (different types so not to get injured) and when I am better than that will take over as a motivating force not to smoke.

My goal is to:

* run a 5k in less than 15 minutes
* do triathlons
* become faster at ice skating
* start brazilian jiu jitsu
* climb a 7a level route

In order to do all of these things I need to stop smoking now (if I want to do these before the end of this year, which I have decided) - and I need to lose weight as well, and of course practice a lot. And take good care of myself in general - sleep well, eat well, recover well, etc.

At some point you *just need to do it.* But it helps to have a strong motivating force behind and in front of you, and to me, that is the fear of getting ill and the desire to get ultra fit. And to be as free as I can be!

Good lungs on your own journey!

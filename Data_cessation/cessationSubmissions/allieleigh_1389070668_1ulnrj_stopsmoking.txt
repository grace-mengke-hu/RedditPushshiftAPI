End of day seven

Okay, so I really never thought I could make it this far but here I am finishing my 7th day of being a non-smoker. I have to admit that day four was my worst but today was relatively okay. I know I'm not out of the woods yet, but it is definitely getting easier.

By the way, does anyone else have dreams about cheating and needing to reset their counter? I had my first one last night and I was genuinely sad that I needed to reset my app because I was doing so well.

QUIT: Day 13, Done for Good.

Continued from this thread posted 1 week ago: https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/3wlju1/10th_time_quitting_6_days_in_wish_me_luck/

Since posting this thread last Saturday, I have encountered numerous revelations in my head. It took 7 years to get here.

Still have not had a cig since December 7th, 1 AM. Seems I can keep it this way, this time.

I went way out of the way with my post-smoke training to make sure there are no places left where I have craving. I attacked all of the things I love doing most with a cig, notably: driving, drinking beer/coffee, after dinner, etc.

I have FINALLY trained myself to go without cigs. Even around smokers, even in a smoky bar, I'm not compelled to light up anymore! I don't hate them for doing it! I don't hate myself for not doing it! I love not doing it!

Give Allen Carr a read, don't give up, and you will succeed folks! Take it from a fool who found success, that anyone can succeed.

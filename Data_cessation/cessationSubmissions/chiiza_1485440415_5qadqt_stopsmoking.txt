Anyone else wake up feeling like they smoked a pack the night before?

It's been almost 40 days for me and I'm not sure if it's my lungs still healing but there are mornings where I feel like I had smoked a whole pack the night before. Voice is raspy, throat feels uncomfortable and chest feels a little heavy.. you know the way you used to feel almost every morning as a smoker. Why do I still have this feeling sometimes? Am I alone on this?

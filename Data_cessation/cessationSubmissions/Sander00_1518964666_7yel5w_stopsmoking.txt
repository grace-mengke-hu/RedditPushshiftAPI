Today is the day!

Today I'm quitting smoking! I just finished reading Allen Carr's book and it really made me understand the psychological side of smoking. I'm almost turning 20 and I don't want to be a smoker when I do. Although I have only smoked for 3-4 years, I'm super done with it. I hope some of my friends will follow me in my journey :). Also because I'm quitting smoking i am quitting smoking weed as well. I just had to tell some people i am quitting :).

I need a goddamn nicotine fix!!! Help!!???

I have been smoking since I was 16 and I'm 23 now. Up until summer 2016 I only smoked one pack a week but now it's up to a pack a day. I haven't smoked since 6pm last night and I need a cigarette so bad. There's a huge snowstorm and I can't leave my house nor do I have any money anyway. I have two more days of this and I don't know what to do. There are times I pace around like a druggy waiting for their next fix. I have been chewing a lot of gum but even that supply is running low. I also go outside to try to get a "rush." I have my porch door open a little bit and I think it might be helping. After writing out this post I feel a little better but I know the cravings will come back. Help!!?

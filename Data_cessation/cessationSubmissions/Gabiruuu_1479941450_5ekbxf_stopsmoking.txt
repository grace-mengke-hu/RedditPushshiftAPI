Saved money in one year: Almost 2000â‚¬ !!!

So, when I decided to quit I read that it would be good to put the cigarettes money in a jar that you could see it growing day by day.

It is a wonderful idea in the beginning. The problem was that with time you get used not smoking, sometimes you don't have money with you to put in the jar, and then you just stoped doing it.

When I was a smoker, even if I was short of money some month, I would continue smoking. Now, if I would be short of money one month, I would not put it on the jar.

This didn't feel right

When I quit smoking, one year ago, I promised myself that I would do with the money whatever I wanted. If I would have spend it in cigarettes, I have the right, when not smoking, to do with that money whatever I want. So, it has been essencial for me to keep saving and putting apart all the money that I am saving.

So, instead of keeping the jar thing, I have programmed my bank account to transfer every week the money I would spend on cigarettes to a saving account. After one year smoke free I have saved 1900â‚¬.

The first 40â‚¬ went to a massage.

Then I bought a pair of sneakers.

Then a trip to Greece!

Then set apart 1000â‚¬ for something I might need.

Now almost finishing a bike.

Going this weekend to Paris to celebrate one year smoke free. (Also payed by my "friends" cigarettes.

It has been really helpful for me to keep the exact amount on the side. It allows me to reward myself for not smoking. It's a great feeling to do all this with the cigarettes money. You kinda fell things were given for free! If you're starting now, you should do it too. You'll see its great! ðŸ˜‰

I see all these posts months and years in...

I'm day one, hour one, minute one. I'm genuinely concerned about the cravings, especially when I wake up. It's not cigarettes I'm quitting, but vaping. I went from one habit to the next. However, I'm pregnant and know there is no better time to do this. 

Any tips for morning/night/after eating nicotine cravings? I went a whopping 2 hours after curiosity today and noticed a quick decline in mood. As soon as I got nicotine in me, immediate relief, though mental frustration. Any advice is sincerely appreciated, as is motivation. I'll need it when I wake up and turn to this in the morning.

For some background, I [31F] smoked 15 years, vaped 3, zero support system. I have the will, but I'm scared.

Made it to day 8! Woo!

I've made it to day 8 and man it's been one interesting ride so far. I just want to say thank you to everyone that replied to my previous post with awesome suggestions for fighting cravings. 

This is the longest I've ever quit so far and at this point I have NO plans of going back. Thanks again for all of your support

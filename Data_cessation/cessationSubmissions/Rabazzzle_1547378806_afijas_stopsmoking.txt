48 hours in and still feeling nothing? Can anyone else relate?

Hey all,
Long time lurker, first time poster. TL/DR at bottom. 
I’m 24 and have been smoking since I turned 18. I’ve never attempted to quit before but about a month ago I realised I was wasting my life on something that gave nothing back and decided I needed to try give it up. Obviously I had no idea what to expect and read this sub a lot as well as health sites. Friday comes and I just sit down for my last smoke (I will admit I teared up realising I was about to lose a friend) then went inside, destroyed my smokes and went to bed. Saturday I went to work, felt normal all day besides being dizzy and feeling like the day flew by. Today has been the same and as I’ve now hit the 48 hour mark I’ve realised I’m still not feeling anything? Is this normal at all? I’m not emotional or craving, I’m just doing what I usually do without the smokes? 

Thanks for any replies! 

TL/DR: 48 hours into quitting cold turkey with no unusual emotions or cravings for smokes.

Trigger at the airport

It’s day 43 off the cigs. I’m feeling great and loving being free of it. Funny though how I got off the plane and I’m thinking about smoking (just thinking about the act not considering doing so). I do feel a pull but it’s like a physical memory manifesting. It is easy to tolerate. For 30 years whenever I got off the plane my main thought would be about getting as quickly to the smoking area as was humanly possible. But now I don’t have to. I don’t want to. It’s awesome! I don’t have to rush anywhere or feel annoyed by (inevitable) delay or other annoyances of travel. Thanks for listening, redditors. And keep up the good work of not smoking ever again.

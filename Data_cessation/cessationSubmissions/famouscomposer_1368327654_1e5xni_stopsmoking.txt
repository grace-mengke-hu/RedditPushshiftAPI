What are some logical and effective ways to attempt to quit smoking?

I've been smoking for almost 3 years, and I'm just tired of it.  I'm the only member of my immediate family (before my younger sister) to stay away from drugs and alcoholism and jail.  Also the first to graduate high school.


I'm sick of feeling winded walking up and down flights of stairs.  I'm an active guy, I run fairly often (2-3 times a week) and I just want to stop smoking for every reason.


My question is fairly simple.  I want to do this.  What have you all done to get past this horrible habit?  I'm sure this is a common question here, but I was hoping for a more personal answer with some testimonials.  I know different things work for different people, but I'm interested in how and why specific things work for specific people.  

I know smoking cigarettes isn't a big deal compared to hard drugs and alcoholism, but I have such a clean record in my family that I want to be the best *me* I possibly can.  I'm going through some huge changes in my life recently, and I want being a "non-smoker" to be part of this new me that I'm working at.

Thanks so much in advance for your help everyone.

This time....

Ok so I quit smoking on the 4th of January. .. It was a sunday... I ended up caving on 8th after a massive argument with the hubster (who isn't quitting) and smoked 3 ciggies. 
However... straight away the next morning I was even more adamant I was quitting.  And this time I'm not even using the 2mg gum. Zero nicotine. I just hit 72 hours and still going strong. (I reset all badges and counters :D)

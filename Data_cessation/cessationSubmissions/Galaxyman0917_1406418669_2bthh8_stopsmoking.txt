Guys I need some help. [Vent]

I've been smoking for a few years. Tried to quit multiple times. I've managed to get it down to smoking at work but I hide it from my wife. I feel like shit for that, but I haven't been able to stop. 

I am desperate. I want to quit. I hate it. But I haven't been able to so far.

4th day

I've just arrived in Bulgaria and it's my fourth day.
Wanna make it through this holiday without smoking, but its hard. Although I've already resisted some strong cravings!!

This change of environment an all its insecurity gets a lot of cravings going. This ajustment to not smoking through all these occasions, leaving the airport, leaving the metro station, having drinks on a terras. Its though.

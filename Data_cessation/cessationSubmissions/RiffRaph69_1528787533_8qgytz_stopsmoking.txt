110 days and everything feels like it’s getting worse

First time posting so please be kind. I’m useless with technology and the internet but I need some guidance. I feel like I have no one to talk to about this, everyone I know smokes or drinks and feels totally normal. I’ve been smoke free for over 100 days, it’s an amazing effort and I’m not interested in taking it up again... BUT I feel like garbage. I’m drinking more than ever! I’m
more uncomfortable in my own skin than ever before. I loved smoking, more than anything. I still love it, I think I always will. But after my best friend killed herself I guess I grew accustomed to losing things I loved and I thought losing another love wouldn’t kill me. It hasn’t killed me. But I feel nothing. I feel empty. I’ve tried doing the healthy thing (running daily, yoga, healthy eating, sleep) for the past few months and it makes me feel worse. Maybe because I’m doing everything right and feel worse than I ever did when I did everything wrong? I want to feel what everyone else seems to feel when they get through the first few months. Truly comfortable and happy in their sobriety. At peace with themselves in their new life. How did they get there? Anyway sorry in advance for the very deep and somewhat revealing post. Any help would be amazing. Cheers

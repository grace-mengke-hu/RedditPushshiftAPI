15 years later....

28 year old male, have been smoking since I was 13. I would stop during my teenage years only during swim season. I have been smoking a minimum of a pack a day for the last 10 years, sometimes even more during my drinking/drug binge days. I quit cold Turkey on the 1st at around 10 PM and haven't had a smoke since. I'm struggling there, but want to do this!!!

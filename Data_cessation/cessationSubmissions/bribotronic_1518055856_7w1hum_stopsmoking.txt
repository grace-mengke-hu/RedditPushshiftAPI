Cheating with smokes that “don’t count”

I smoked about a pack a day for 10 years. On January 1st, I officially quit, with the help of NRT patches. It was hard to break the habit for the first week or two (especially at work, where there’s other smokers) but I finally felt like I got to a place where I was no longer addicted. During my quit, my husband and I split up, but even through that, I stayed strong. I feel guilty though, because my boss often pressures me to “just smoke today” any time there’s a crisis at work. Or sometimes even when there’s not. I don’t always give in, but sometimes I feel like, “eh, fuck it.” I haven’t bought my own pack, or smoked anywhere other than at work, but over the 6 or so weeks since “quitting,” I’ve probably had about 20 peer-pressure cigarettes with my boss. I keep telling myself it’s fine as long as I don’t smoke on my own time or buy my own cigarettes but I know it’s a really slippery slope. I guess I don’t know what the point of this post is, other than I feel guilty and like I need to confess :(

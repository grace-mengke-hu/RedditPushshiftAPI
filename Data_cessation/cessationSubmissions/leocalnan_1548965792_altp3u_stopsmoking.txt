Friends being unhelpul

It's just coming up to my 2nd day of being smoke free and it's getting really bad. 
I'm so angry at everything (I know this is a side effect of withdrawal). 
I would have hoped that the two of my best friends would have been proud of me for managing this first step, but they said that 2 days is nothing.
It's really wanted to make me relapse as its only been 2 days and I've got so much further to go.
I was proud of myself before I messaged them, now I feel like awful. 
Help me

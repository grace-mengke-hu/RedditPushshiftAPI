2 weeks today.

Two weeks without a cigarette.  I'm not even sure what number quit attempt I'm on. I did it before for almost 2 years. Then I moved back home and started smoking again about a year ago. I'm hoping this time sticks. I'm hoping I can finally be done with that disgusting awful habit. I'm glad I've decided to be done I'm just hoping it really is the last last time.

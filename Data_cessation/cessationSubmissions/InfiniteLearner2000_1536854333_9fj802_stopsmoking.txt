Sleep Issues

Anyone else have sleep issues after quitting smoking? I’m 25 days in and still having major lack of sleep issues. 

Can’t seem to get more than 4-6 hours. I know 6 ain’t bad but 4 is not enough for me, most days it’s closer to 4. I’ll get up to pee after 3 hrs of sleeping and go back to sleep and stay asleep for an hour or so then I keep waking up every five minutes if I do ever fall back asleep. So I give up at the 4-5 hr mark.

Looking for advice. I still am vaping but with 0 mg nicotine so I haven’t had any nicotine in 25 days.

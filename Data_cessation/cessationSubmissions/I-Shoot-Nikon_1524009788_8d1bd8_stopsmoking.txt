Emotional wreck without the patch - 3-plus weeks quit.

Hey! This is my first-ever Reddit post. I quit smoking a little more than three weeks ago after some 30 years of mostly a pack a day, though half a pack in the last few years. Don't know if I could have done it without the patch. Problem, is, I'd actually like to be rid of the patch, but if I go without it for a few hours I turn into an emotional wreck. I cry for no reason, am anxious and nervous and fearful and sad all at the same time. I can't get a hold of myself. Putting the patch back on relieves this in a hour or so. Good grief, what happens when the patch program ends? I don't want to have to stick these things to me each day for the rest of my life just to have some sanity! Any one else experience this?

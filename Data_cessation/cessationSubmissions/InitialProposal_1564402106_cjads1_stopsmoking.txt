Day 28 . Back to college and I am getting strong urge to smoke after seeing my colleagues smoking around me . It is so difficult to resist the nicotine .

So I am back at my college , I started smoking in college 2 years ago and I about a month  ago . But ever since I returned to college and around my friends and the culture here , I am getting strong urges to quit and smoke a cigarette . I know if I start off with 1 , I will relapse and fall into same cycle again . I do not want cigarettes to damage my body ,more , but its so difficult to control now.

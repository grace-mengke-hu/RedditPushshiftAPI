Nicotine free for around 40 days. The story of quiting

I'm 20 and I can't even remember exactly which year I started to smoke probably 7 years of smoking or more (so 13). At 16 was the first and the longest attempt to quit I did it with 3 other guys and finally we gave up all before exams (around 3 months of quiting) but I knew and I wanted to start again. From 16 to 20 I did:

1. Betting with friends on smth (always lose except ones betting with other smokers mostly we started smoking together). Smoke alone hiding feeling so awful about it. Did it a lot of times - not working.

2. Simply stopped smoking telling myself this is the last one and that is it. Maybe I was quiting from 2-5 days not more. Not working also cause of lack of motivation.

3. Used e-cigs - shit, really. Did it for a month that started to smoke usual ones again. The only benefit I found is smell.

4. Started to make cigarettes by myself not sure how it calls in english. But there are better as I think tobacco definetely better and you can make small cigarettes decreasing quantity of nicotine maybe I'm misteken here. But anyway I liked it more than just cigarettes.

5. Read Allan's book received a lot of motivation and finally stopped

Pretty sure I'll never start it again I don't even understand how stupid I was. Never forgive myself if I start doing that shit again

Good luck me and everyone.

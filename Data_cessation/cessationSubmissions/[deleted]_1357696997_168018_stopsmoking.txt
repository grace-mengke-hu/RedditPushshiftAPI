Friday is approaching...

So I quit smoking on New Years, so far everything has been great :) Also, no real urges to purchase/smoke even around coworkers who are smoking. But, I'm scared...Three reasons why I'm scared of this upcoming friday.

I will be...
1) with close friends who almost all smokers.
2) be going to places where everyone smokes inside.
3) be drinking heavily (i'm Canadian)

What have others done in this situation to overcome this?

How do I stop smoking cigs casually and then end up temporarily addicted to them? I want to stop for good.

I smoked a lot of cigarettes in college, almost a pack a day smoker. 

Then I moved back with my parents and spent less time around people who smoked cigs. 

Then I moved out to the big city where a bunch of my friends live. 

A good chunk of us smoke cigs and when everyone goes out for a cig break, I then follow as well and smoke out of habit, more so for the social aspect. 

I'm also that guy who doesn't really smoke, but ends up bumming from friends when I have that craving. Then I realize that I'm bumming way too much and that I should get my own cigs, so I go ahead and do that.

Then I'm like "Well, I got this pack now, might as well smoke it". Around 2-3 a day.

After the pack is gone, I essentially quit cold turkey because I really don't crave it that much.

My roommate also smokes, so he will ask me if I want to go outside with him for a smoke break. I do it because I enjoy smoking cigs with my roommate.

Also, if I drink with my friends, I am extremely likely to go out and just buy a pack of cigs.

The reasons I want to quit are the following:

* I hate going out in the cold to have to smoke a cig
* Cigs make my hands smell as well as my clothes, teeth, and everything else, so I always wash my hands after a smoke
* I waste so much time getting up for a smoke break, it's more of method of procrastination. 
* Cigs make me feel cig sometimes after smoking one. There's a feeling of regret, like I was better off not smoking a cigarette in the first place
* Costs $$, but luckily I don't smoke too much
* it's bad for my health

The hardest part is saying no to someone if I want to go out for a smoke or resisting urge to have a cigarette if I notice other people smoking cigs (especially my roommate or friends).

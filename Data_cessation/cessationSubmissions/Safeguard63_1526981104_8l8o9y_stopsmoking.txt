It's Over!

Its 5:22am here in Boston but I just can't sleep. I broke up with the love of my life today for good...It was an abusive relationship. It was killing me, and yet I kept coming back, because there were some good points. It could make me feel smarter, and calmer, give me the energy to get through a tough day, or relax me enough to sleep well at night, give me an exuse to take a few minutes for myself...

I didn't want to let go. Everyone tried to warn me, No one could understand why I just didn't leave it. But evey time I tried, I just did not feel like "me" without, "It". I loved it, I missed it, we had a history, my memories are all tied up with it, and they are not all bad memories...some are the very best! 

But it's a very dysfunctional relationship. It makes me feel bad about myself, it make's me look and smell bad, it makes me sick and ashamed. It makes me feel weak willed and under it's constant control.  And it will kill me if I stay involved with it. I am sick of it! 

I want to be proud of the way I live. I can never be that, as long as I remain a victim of my own inability to stand up to this monster, once and for all, and say, "No more!" I will not run to you to sooth myself because you feed of my oxygen and rob me of my health. I am done with you. I QUIT! 

I know I will mourn this loss, grieve and struggle. Breaking up IS indeed, hard to do.

But when I feel that dangerous undertow, dragging me backwards toward my untimely demise, I will take courage and draw strength, from knowing that I have it in me to do this! and I am, finally, free to live in the peace I make for myself knowing I did the right thing. In time It will get easier. (Right?). ;)

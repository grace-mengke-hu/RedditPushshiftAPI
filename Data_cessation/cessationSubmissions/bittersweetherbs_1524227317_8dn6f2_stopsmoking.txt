Shifted dependency to alcohol?

I am now smoke free for about 16 days and it’s been relatively easy to abstain from nicotine this time. But I don’t know... it seems like I am drinking way more alcohol (especially beer) for the last week or something. Last three days it have been 4 beers in the evening each. Normally I drink 1-2 beers on the weekend, that’s it. Has someone observed something similar ? Do you think it is critical ?

On my way

Hi guys,
I'm a 25 year old female and I've been a smoker off and on for 5 years. I quit in may 2015 and started back in august after a traumatic with crappy family inlaw. Anyway I've decided to quit again , winging myself off. Yesterday I only had 1 cig ,today I've had none and don't play on having any at all. I'm really jittery and actually depressed. Today is hard for me , really freakin hard. Probably because I have a midterm. I almost want to cry. I feel like I'm all over the place and have no coping mechanisms. Hopefully it will end soon because now I'm just miserable.

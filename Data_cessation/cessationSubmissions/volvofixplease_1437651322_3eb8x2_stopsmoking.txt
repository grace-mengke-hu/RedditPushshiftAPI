What is even going on?

I mean i quit several times but this time around i just know that i kicked it for ever but i have another problem which are withdrawal symptoms,i cant quite say its all "in my head" becouse it just isnt i feel so lost and like im completely de personalized like i have zero self respect and self confidence,i feel foggy in my mind i cant even take the most simplest decisions without questioning myself and im not even sure what is going on I WAS NEVER THIS CONFUSED IN MY LIFE,im not sure if this is something the cigarettes were masking or if they were why didnt this happen at previous times and also i feel like i have below zero energy like literally minus energy...this is my third day but I didnt have a craving yet just these strange things happening with my mind.Help much appreciated.

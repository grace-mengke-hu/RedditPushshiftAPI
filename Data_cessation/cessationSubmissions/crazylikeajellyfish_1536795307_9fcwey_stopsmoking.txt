Vent: 4th Day Clean, Crawling Outta My Skin

Fair warning, profanity. I need to get this out of my head for my sanity and sobriety right now -- y'all are the best.

I just messaged to have my badge removed, last tobacco I had was in a spliff on Saturday night, so today's my first full day with all the nicotine back out of my system. Feeling like a fucking animal caged in my head right now, want a couple puffs like nobody's business, but I know it isn't going to help. The first puff isn't satisfying, it makes me want a second, and then the cig, and then another with a beer, then I want one with lunch tomorrow, and before I know it I've slipped all the way back into square zero.

For context, I:
- smoked full time for three years
- quit for a year
- picked it back up for a few months
- moved to vaping, did that for a couple years
- felt my lungs getting sticky, switched to nicotine gum for ~6 months
- managed to fully nicotine free for the front half of this summer, but then started cheating when I drank, bumming drags or cigs outside bars

Labor Day weekend I consumed a little bit four days in a row, then again on Friday and Saturday this past weekend. A cig or less each day, almost all through spliffs. Doesn't take much to restart that dependence. Woke up on Sunday feeling like absolute shit, did nothing but sleep through hangover and withdrawal.

The withdrawals got steadily worse each day, today it's been really nagging. I know it's only uphill from here, this is peak physical withdrawal. But fucking WOW, though, am I an angsty bastard right now.  My brain wants to crawl out of my skull, my chest feels like tighter than a spring. Feel like shouting, fighting, smoking pot (another vice I'm struggling to moderate), anything -- pent up as hell.

Instead of doing that, instead of wandering to a bar and bumming, I'm sitting on the ride home from work typing out my stream of consciousness, trying not to snarl at the guy driving the Lyft. When I get there I am going to meditate for 20 minutes, and then I'm going to go lift weights, because exercise always helps with cravings.

Now feels miserable, but the pain of regret will sting worse than the pain of discipline. Tomorrow will be better. Thank you all for being here, this beats the hell out of ranting at my non-addict friends who just don't get it.

I will not smoke with you today.

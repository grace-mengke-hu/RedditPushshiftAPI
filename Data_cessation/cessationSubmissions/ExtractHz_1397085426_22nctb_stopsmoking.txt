Day 10: "Cravings"

Theyre nothing compared to the endorphin rush i get when i remind myself how much money and time im saving by not smoking! over the last few years ive gotten to 36/48 hours of no smoking and have caved in. losing time and time again to my pack and a half a day habbit. To me beating my addiction seemed like an insurmountable goal,   if only i knew  that once the first few days of withdrawl are over with how easy it really gets.

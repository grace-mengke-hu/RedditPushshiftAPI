I fell back

I was almost 1 month smoke free and that's the longest I've gone after smoking a pack for almost 9 years.
But then I had a horrible fight w my mother and she got mad and started smoking indoors. That evening I met a friend that smokes and first time I've gone out for drinks since before quitting so you can probably imagine..
But now it "clicked" again so I'm trying again. First two days where the hardest then two weeks for cravings to pretty much stop.
I want to see when I stop think about the sticks overall..

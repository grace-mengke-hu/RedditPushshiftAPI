Quit Smoking on 4 January. Not feeling so good now.

Last year, in September, I decided I will stop on New Year's. I reduced my intake to one cigarette a day slowly. On 1 January, I swore I will never smoke again. On 4 January, a few friends invented me to a party and I smoked. The next morning, I felt disgusted with myself and left my packs at the water-cooler where it promptly disappeared. Sometimes, I felt down but the sense of achievement that I didn't smoke made up for it. Now, I not feeling so confident and I chewing my nails. I feel if don't smoke a cig, I won't be able to do anything. What should I do?

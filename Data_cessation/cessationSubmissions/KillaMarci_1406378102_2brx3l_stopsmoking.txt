And.....done!

The first few weeks were really hard but it got easier as time went by. This subreddit really helped in getting me to this point so I want to thank y'all for yer support! :) Also thanks to Allan Carr for writing that great book which gave me a great insight to my own psyche.

To everyone who's just starting out: Keep going, its totally worth it.

Encouragement needed, please.

It's been a month and two days since my last smoke. And it seems like it's been a gazillion years.  In this time I've written 3.5 graduate term papers (I still have half of a paper to write and it's got to be done on Monday).  I've finished four graduate course (well, except for that half of a paper) and a Turkish language course.  That's all awesome news.  But, I'm in my second year of grad school, so I have a comprehensive paper coming up (due at the end of May) and then I have the generals exam in August.  Needless to say, I am tired, freaking out about the future, and on top of that, I am relearning how to deal with stress.  I know that the smokes won't help me destress (and in fact, it will only increase my stress, thanks Mr. Carr for the knowledge) but -- ohmygoodness, today I've been jonesin' for the "relaxation" of a smoke break.  What's even sadder is that yesterday, I commented to a fellow grad student Redditor on tips for quitting smoking.  Oh man, oh man. 

I know I can do this; the physical addiction is over, it's all mental from here.  

So, those of you how have some extra good vibes hanging around, send 'em my way.  Thanks a million in advance.  Believe me, I'll pay it forward.

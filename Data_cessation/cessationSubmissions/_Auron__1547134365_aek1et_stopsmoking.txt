Day 8 - went to the gas station

.. and bought some sodas, snacks, and gun to stave off a beast of cravings for work today. Not healthy, but better than falling back into the smoking trap. Since I was a regular at that place I told the cashier I quit and he was shocked I quit cold turkey. Feels good.

(By the way, Sabra Hummus + Pretzel packs have **way** too much salt. Now that my sense of taste is back, it tastes like someone accidently dumped too much salt in it. Then I saw it has 840mg on the label. Woah. Avoiding that from now on.)

99 days ago today

99 days ago today, I was heading down to the Houston airport to head to Germany for a three week vacation. I smoked my last cigarette and put it out right before entering the airport doors. I knew it was gonna be a long hard road, but it has made all the difference in the world. I feel better, healthier, stronger. My cough is gone and I don't always have to fight my cravings for a smoke. I still get minor cravings, but nothing I can't handle. I am proudly smoke free and never going back :)

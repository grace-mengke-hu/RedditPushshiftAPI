New quitter, tips?

I smoke a packet (25s) of Benson and Hedges a day.  I have now decided I can't afford to spend $25 dollars a day on cigarettes. :(  But if it's not Benson and Hedges it's nothing for me, I can't smoke anything else.  I've been smoking full time since I was 15 and I'm now 19.  I always promised my mum I would quit smoking by the time I wasn't a teenager anymore.  I have no idea how to quit though! Any tips for a first time quitter?

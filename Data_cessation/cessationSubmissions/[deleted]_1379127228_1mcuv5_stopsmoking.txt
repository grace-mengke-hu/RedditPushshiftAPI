Hi guys! (New here...)

Just saying hello.  I think I'll be visiting this sub quite a bit.

It's been seven weeks.

I'm 33, was smoking up to a pack a day for years.  Re-joined an outrigger canoe racing team because I doubted my addiction would last the season.  (Spoiler alert:  it didn't.)

My season just ended--my canoe took 3rd in our division at the Catalina State Champs Sunday!

Now, I'm going to challenge myself to yoga, sprint triathlons, a half-marathon, and a standup paddle race.

I've quit before and fallen off the wagon, but the times I lasted the longest were times when I was training, training, training.  So that's just what I'm gonna do for the foreseeable future.

I see this one lasting a long time, but I had to re-engineer my life.

This is all for now folks, but I think I'm gonna like it on this sub.

Congrats to all of you who've stayed strong, and to those faltering:  get back on your feet for another round before the ref calls it!  You can do it!

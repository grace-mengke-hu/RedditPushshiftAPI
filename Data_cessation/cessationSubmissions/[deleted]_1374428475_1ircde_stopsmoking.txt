A 23 years old boy who've just gone cold turkey. Help him.

Ciao r/stopsmoking, I'm a 23 year old ex-smoker from Southern Italy.

A small excursus on my smoking habit: when I was 14, on a hot summer afternoon, my best friend D picked me up from home to go to the seaside. But since he bought a pack of cigarettes, and me being a gullible spoiled kid, we went somewhere else to hide and to learn to smoke (yeah because your body has to get used to take that crap.) Since that goddamn day, I've enjoyed smoking, after a coffee, while drinking a beer, between lessons etc.... until now.

When I studied abroad in Japan for six months, I was so surprised that NOONE else beside me smoked in that dorm, and we were more than 100 people. And also, while I was there, I've met a girl and we started dating (it's so convenient to live in the same building ;) ), but she really hated to kiss me after I had a smoke. As a result, I've drastically lowered the number of consumed cigarettes in a day.

Back here in Italy, I slipped into my old habits (drinking, smoking, procrastinating) while being depressed since I'd got used being there.
But something weird happened: my throat has since been full of phlegm every morning, to the point of being difficul to talk. And I noticed the less i smoked the day before, the better I woke up.

So (finally it's the end): Today I call my friend D, go to the sea, went to a caf√© after, smoked our last cigarette,crushed our full boxes in front of each other and promised we won't buy another one ever again.

This idea was floating in my mind since I discovered reddit and this wonderful sub. So, I've basically gone cold turkey... I don't want to smoke anymore. I'm tired of wasting money, filling my body with tar and thinking I cannot enjoy any activity anymore 'cause I'm not sucking burned paper.

PLEASE HELP ME!!!

By the way, sorry if I've made some mistakes, English is not my mother-tongue :)

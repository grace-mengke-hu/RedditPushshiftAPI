Haven't smoked since Friday, but today I work helpdesk...

This is my biggest test because it's a stressful job and I usually cope by going outside to smoke and bitch about dumb/angry clients. It is now 11:50am and so far I have not smoked, but the temptation is really strong. I have gum and also toothpicks to chew on, and my jaw is getting sore already. I have also threatened to murder my colleagues about 20 times XD Wish me luck, reddit!

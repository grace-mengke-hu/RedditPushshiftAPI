Have not smoked for 9 months but thinking about it more lately, can anyone relate?

I have not had a cigarette in over 9 months, but I am starting to think about it more lately it feels like. I am still on the side of not smoking, but it does not feel quite as firm as before. Can anyone relate to this?

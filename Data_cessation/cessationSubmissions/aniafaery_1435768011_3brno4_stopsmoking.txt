For last year's July 1'ers...we made it a year.

I hope some of you are still with me. It was quite the spur of the moment "ok, I'm in!" thread and I hope that at least some of you  managed to push through and for any that didn't, I hope you found or will find success on a different quit date. Thanks /r/stopsmoking for being so supportive and answering so many questions for me at the beginning. You guys are the best kind of community. 

1 year, guys. I'm actually tearing up a little bit thinking about it. For those of you wondering, in my case (1/2 pack a day in NC where cigarettes are cheaper) that's $958 saved and 3,650 cigarettes not smoked. It doesn't seem like a huge amount, but I smoked for 20 years. Think of all that money wasted.

Sincerely y'all, thank you. Thank you for being my inspiration so often when I needed it and for just being here for me to come scroll through when I was fighting cravings.

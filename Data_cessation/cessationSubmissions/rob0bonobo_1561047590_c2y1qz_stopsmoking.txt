Success/Failure

I chewed nic gum and vaped 0.1mg/ml eliquid for a couple weeks. Got myself down to basically less than 1 cig worth of nicotine on the vape per day + about 6 pieces of gum per day. Woke up yesterday without the strong withdrawal feeling, just like a sort of empty / bored / depressed feeling. I thought, well I must be over the worst bit of the withdrawal, I guess I will stick to not chewing anymore and see how long I can go. Made it from 8am til 2pm like that and didn't chew any gum... then i chewed a piece of gum and it didn't do anything. I chewed another and spit it out before it was done. Then I went to the convenience store and bought a pod for my Juul style vape (57mg/ml). Been a day since then and vaped 2ml... I'm giving up for now, I'm just going to vape my strong nicotine and save money because all the gum I chew and vaping loads of small nicotine liquid adds up to cost me almost as much as smoking. 

This is the second time in 3 months that I got over the worst bit of the withdrawal.. I've found that the hardest bit isn't weaning down to nothing and the unpleasant sensation of strong withdrawal cravings... but the hardest bit is when I get down to nothing and there's no strong cravings but I just can't stop thinking about nicotine.

I think that must be what it's like for people to go cold turkey when they smoke 5  - 10 cigarettes a day. It's still not easy, but it's a different kind of battle.

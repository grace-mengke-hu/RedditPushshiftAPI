Two weeks smoke free today!!! I feel so amazing that I made it this far!!!

Thanks to this sub for helping me through during my worst moments.  I almost went back but I haven't strayed once so I think that is freaking awesome.  I hope I can keep this streak going!!!   20 year smoker not looking back baby!!!

Lightheaded after being smoke-free.

Hey guys!

It’s been 21 days I’m smoke-free, been pack-a-day smoker for 7-8 years. I was okay the first phase, but then began feeling lightheaded later on for some reason. I don’t have the urge/need to smoke, but feeling super anxious, lightheaded, and generally depressed after 10 days of being smoke-free. Have any of you experienced this ? 

Thanks for your time! Looking forward to hear your response! :-)

Quitting!

I have said this to myself a number of times and have shamelessly picked up a smoke forgetting all the things I say every time to myself about smoking. I have to quit for myself, for my health and for everything good. I will try harder this time. I hope I stand up to myself for a change. My health is suffering immensely and now I canâ€™t afford to continue this poisonous habit anymore. I wish I remember this!

Day 1 - Need some encouragement.

I have failed probably 200 times alone in the past six months alone, so it's really tough to go on, but one thing I've learned is that I should really try to quit while I'm not currently working. A two-day weekend isn't long enough to surpass that 3 day nicotine free stage that it takes to get through to be a non-smoker, and I'm actually on vacation right now until Wednesday. I am super broke right now and can't afford ciggs anyways, so I'm just playing games smoking bud watching TV and catching up on chores and things I need to do, but now I decided to also quit ciggs during vacation so I can avoid the pesky work breaks where I know I can get a square for free.

So if i make it until 7:15pm today, that's a whole day for me.

3 Hours, 3 Days, 3Weeks, 3Months

After 3 Hours I got the first time unbalanced and furios because i needed a smoke so bad.

After 3 Days I was temped hard in the Store and very close to buy a pack. 

After 3 Weeks was the first Weekend where I went out drinking and really wanted to smoke with my drink.
 
After 3 Months came the last temptation, in form of E-cigs and/or a Cigar, because I thought I could handle 1. I thought I stopped smoking for 3 Months, so stopping again will not be a big problem.

These are my kind of craving moments when it comes to Stop Smoking. I try quit 6 times; 5 times I failed because of these Waypoints. I don't know if it was always exact 3days or 3weeks but it felt like it and maybe its different for others. But first rage, the first time in a Store, the first time drinking and the first time thinking i quit so 1 smoke can't harm me; are the hard ones for when it came to stop smoking. 
Now i have about 4 Months and all these Triggers are behind me, I started swimming and cycling. I feel I quit for good and I have not been that healthy in a long a time, but just to be saved I will put "not starting to smoke again" on my new years resolution. 
Whatever your cravings are and whenever they come, maybe you will not stop the first try, but remember why you want to stop and never stop trying, it will become easier over the time.

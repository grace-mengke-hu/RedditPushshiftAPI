How much damage am I really doing?

My nicotine habit is unusual. For the past few years I've been breaking up cigarettes and smoking the tobacco out of a small pipe. I used to be a pretty big pot head, but I haven't smoked weed for years now and I don't intent to go back to it. Unfortunately, I seem to have switched from one habit to another. I used to load up a bowl of weed and add a bit of tobacco to it. Over time I started increasing the about of tobacco I was adding until I realized I wasn't getting much enjoyment from the weed anymore, it just made me paranoid. Now I just smoke a few bowls of tobacco every day instead. On most days I break up between one and two cigarettes a day and smoke the tobacco in my pipe. On weekends I smoke more, perhaps 3 or 4 cigarettes a day worth of tobacco. I find myself buying a pack of cigarettes about once every week and a half. My question is, how much damage am I really doing? I would like to think that this amount of tobacco is negligible, but I have to admit I feel addicted to the nicotine buzz and sometimes my lungs start to feel like shit. Also, I have to take into account that I'm smoking the tobacco without a filter, which can't be good. Id like to cut back, or even quit entirely, but I wanted to hear what people thought about how harmful my habit really is. Any feedback would be appreciated.

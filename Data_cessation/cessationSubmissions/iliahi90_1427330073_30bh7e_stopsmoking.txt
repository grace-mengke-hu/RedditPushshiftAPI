I relapsed. ...on day One

I for sure thought today was the day. In fact, I went 18 hours without a cigarette. Yaay! I was going to request my badge....And then I went home. My husband is also a smoker and has not figured out when he wants to join the smoke free train with me. He is my best supporter, but knowing he is at some point going to light up, makes this a little harder. Has this happened to anyone else?  Or am I just a miserable and pathetic failure?

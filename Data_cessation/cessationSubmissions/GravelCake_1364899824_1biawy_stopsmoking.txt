Coming up on 1 week. I just ran 3 miles - I can BREATHE!

So I tried to quit about a month ago (smoked for 2 years), I made a post about it. I failed, but I managed to reduce the amount of cigs from a whole pack a day to about half a day over the past month. Today, it's been 6 days without a cig. It just sort of happened. I was moody and impatient with people for about 4-5 days. Luckily its already getting better.

Not smoking helps me breathe much better when working out. I ran 3 miles today without running out of breath, only a week ago I would be chronically coughing after a mile or so.

3 miles might not seem long to some of you, but considering how quickly my lungs are improving, I feel f'ing great!

Here is what else has happened in less than a week for me:

*    My sense of smell is back. Walking to work with spring in the air is amazing now.
*    My gums no longer bleed when I brush.
*    My teeth are losing their yellow tint.
*    My tongue doesn't smell/taste like an ashtray. Big plus when making out!
*    My snoring has gone down somewhat.
*    My clothes don't smell like smoke, they smell good now.
*    I wake up feeling content and even a little happy, instead of reaching for the pack right away.
*    45 bucks saved in 6 days. New clothes!

I quit!! 13 days with no cigarettes!

I visualize myself turning off a craving like a switch. It is becoming easier and easier to not acknowledge the cravings. I do not dismiss them or give them any power . I literally tell myself to feel nothing. There is more of a mind body connection than I ever thought. When I start to get that- stomach/gut butterfly sad- I want to smoke feeling, Ive literally been turning it off. Hard to explain, but so far it's working for me!  I'm starting to feel that I can apply what I'm learning to other areas in my life. So maybe smoking in my life will technically go down as a good thing, because of what I'm learning about myself and human emotion and feelings as I'm getting through the early stages of quitting this nasty habit.

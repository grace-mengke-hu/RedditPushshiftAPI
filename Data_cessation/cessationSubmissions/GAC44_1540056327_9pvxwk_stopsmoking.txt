Really worried about my lungs...

I’m 26 trying to quit smoking because it’s getting hard to breath most of the time I’m breathing through my mouth and I get out of breath for the smallest tasks such as going into my closet to get clothes and putting them on. I have to take a break while going up stairs and walking more than a block leaves me huffing and puffing. Sometimes I’ll just be laying in bed trying to sleep and having trouble breathing. I’m really worried that my lungs are permanently damaged and even if I manage to quit it’s too late. I don’t know what to do to repair them besides to quit smoking...

To vap or not to vap - my story

Hi all,

I’ve been a pack a day smoker for 13 years but realized last year that my health is spiralling downward and it’s now or never to get back on track. I used to be the outdoors active gym type, now I avoid situations where I can’t smoke. Social events, family events, even career opportunities. My god to read that is painful.

I’m also an alcoholic and in 2017 that was my first priority, been sober 6 months and the cravings are long since past. 

I have been lurking in this sub on and off, I’m so scared of quitting that even subscribing to it and downloading Allen Carr’s book caused an anxiety attack - but I did it !

I’m curious for feedback on vaping to lower the physical addiction to nicotine before quitting altogether. I’m very anxious of nicotine withdrawal but because of my experience with alcohol, I question whether this would just be my addict brain negotiation with myself.

Thank you and I look forward to the day I can request a badge !

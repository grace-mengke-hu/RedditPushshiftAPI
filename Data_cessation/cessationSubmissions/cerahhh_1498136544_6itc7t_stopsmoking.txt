Day 2 of the e cig.

I'm quitting using an e cigarette and it's been easy so far. Problem is, I barely know anyone that has quit properly with it. Most people I know have been smoking their e cig for well over a year. I don't want to simply transfer my addiction to nicotine to another way of taking it in, especially as there just isn't enough research on e cigarettes and we don't know the real impact they have on our bodies. I can't assume it's good for me. 

Ideally I'd like to be on it for a month and then just stop. I'm spending my first week on quite a high nicotine percentage until I get used to it and then dropping to the lowest possible one before 0 at the end of the week. I'll keep using that for at least 2 weeks but I'm not sure whether to bother getting the liquid that has no nicotine in for my fourth week before giving it up or just give up the whole thing. It sort of seems pointless but if I'm ok on 0, I guess it would be a way of proving to myself most of my addiction stems from habit. 

What do you guys think?

Anyone on here managed to quit with the e cigarette?

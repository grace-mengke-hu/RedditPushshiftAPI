I dont understand myself

Hey all . I've been smoking like for 4 yrs and now Im smoke free for 2 months . Im comfident about myself and Im sure that i wouldn,t turn back for that disgusting sh*t anymore ! But one thing just can't get of my mind. At the bigining of quiting , every night before sleep i used to listen to Allen , google around about smoking drawbacks , it was my key to succes . Now after all that time im still thinking and im enjoying listening to vids about smoke harm /read reddit posts. I feel like smoking just took a peace out of me because i will always remember being a smoker. Anyway i know im a happy quiter , but do you guys feel anythinf the same , that you want to check and listen all that crap about smoking and etc. Sorry for my english..

2 months in (73 days). What changed ?

i'm at about two months. I'm 31, used nicotine substitutes like patches (i don't have to use it everyday now, i can go a few days without my substitutes). I feel a lot better and prouder. Also i did 3 hours of sport a week and changed mumy diet to avoid getting fat and my weight stayed stable. I had so weird sensations in my heart too, that really scared me, and now I didn't notice this problem anymore. Also i've been depressed for a long time regularly and I saw that smoking was very much related to depression so it was a huge motivation for me to not relapse in the hardest times. I overall feel better in my mind.

During the rough times also I used to look at a list of benefits on health and check where i was, and thought proud i made it there and that i had to get to the next step. (Exemple after 30 minutes of cessation your heart rate becomes normal, then the next step is probably after a few hours when the nicotine in your body decreased by half or totally).

I can wake up less tired. I actually started my 3 hours of sport a week 2or 3 weeks before i quit smoking to get used to it, be in motion already for the time i cease and not do too much hard things at the same time. Sport was also a huge help as it was something I could rely on. The first time i did sport after years of not doing anything was one of the hardest thing i've experienced for years but it payed. I feel much better during sport and always look to push my limits. Also thanks to quitting i think i became more endurant. 

In any case it's worth it to endure the hard times to get where i'm at.

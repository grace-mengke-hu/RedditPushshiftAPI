Using a wicked case of the flu to kick-start stopping.

Quit for 15 years once after smoking for 25 years, then 3 years ago I started back up. I mention this to warn long time quitters that you are never safe. When I quit for 15 years it was after being really sick like I was this time, so I figure it's now or never. Thanks for the support!

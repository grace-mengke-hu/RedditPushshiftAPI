Nicotine is garbage.

I am using hate to quit smoking. :)  I hate nicotine in all it's forms and cigarettes.  I really don't understand why I want to smoke so much.  Tastes like crap, feels like crap, smells like crap, spends like crap, spreads like crap, sticks like crap.  Anyway... it's the toughest thing I've ever wanted to quit, and I'm having a hard and crappy time of it.   Really.

Cold turkey. Right now. I'm done with this.

Hello /r/stopsmoking (Warning: non-native speaker)

I've been smoking since i was 14-15 (22 right now). And for the last 2-3 years i had thoughts about wanting to quit every day. 

I was able to abstain for ~1 month after i completed 2 week water fast. But the habit came back (new year holidays with a lot of alcohol).

Today i'm quitting for good and starting my 40 day water fast. After completing it i will change my lifestyle to kill this habit forever.

Good luck to everyone on this path. All the stories on this subreddit are really motivational and i want to thank everyone for taking part in this.

I will update this post after 40 days.

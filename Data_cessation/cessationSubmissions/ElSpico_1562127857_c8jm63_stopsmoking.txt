I guess I quit.

So because I’m stupid, I picked up vaping w high levels of nicotine last year and have gotten REALLY bad lately at using it all day every day. I thought about it waiting for me at home while at work, I got pissed every time it died, I couldn’t even wait for it to charge 100% before using it and going out for long periods of time without it was the worst thing ever. 

I know there’s a lot of post cigarette smokers here and what you guys go through is much harder but I just wanted to share with people that understand. Today I’m just over it all. I threw my expensive vapes in the trash and that’s where they’ll stay. I was stalling by claiming I’d “sell them” but fuck that I’m not getting that money back and that’s it. I don’t want to be a guinea pig for this stupid fad and I don’t want my throat to hurt or my lungs to feel tight just for a 30 second buzz anymore. It’s over today.

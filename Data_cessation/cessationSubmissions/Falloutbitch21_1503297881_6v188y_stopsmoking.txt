68 hours smoke free

I was doing so well up until the past few hours. Since I got out of work the craving has been intense and will not go away. I could use some words of encouragement.

The hardest part is I think I didn't really want to quit for ME and my own health. But I am pregnant so I am doing it for my baby.

6 months no nicotine!!!!

I made it to six months and it finally is pretty easy ðŸ¤ª 

Also itâ€™s mental health awareness month and itâ€™s okay to not be okay sometimes and to seek help if needed ðŸ’— and always try to be kind to everyone regardless of their mental state please cause lifeâ€™s very hard.

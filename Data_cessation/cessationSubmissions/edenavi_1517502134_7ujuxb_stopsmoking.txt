How do I know if I’m “ready” to quit?

I was told by my mom who quit back in the 80s that people can’t quit things like cigarettes unless they’re ready to. 
Part of me tells me I’m ready and there’ll be times I smoke a cigarette and get this overwhelming “I’m done with this bullshit” feeling and put it out early, but 3 days and 2 single cig lapses in I’m wondering if I’m even ready. I want to smoke so badly, maybe I wasn’t ready yet and it’ll be easier if I go a bit longer and hate it a bit more? Help please...

Edit: there’s also just part of me telling me that smoking is part of who I am now and it’s scary to think I have to come up with a non-smoking version of me to be.

i sat next to a smoker yesterday and had a few moments where i smelt smoke (unintentionaly inhaled) well now my cravings have gone mental, i was fine up until today, i feel like im withdrawing again! but i havent smoked!!! it was a maximum of 2 or 3 times i smelt or breathed in smoke. any advice would be great, thanks in advance

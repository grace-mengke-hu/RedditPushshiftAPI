Did anyone else hallucinate during withdrawals?

To start this obvious question off, let me first admit that I have Schizo-Affective Disorder (for me, paranoid schizophrenia and bi-polar disorder) so anything that I see that isn't within my ordinarily normal hallucinations is a cause for concern. I had my last smoke of a real cigarette around 3pm I think, that was yesterday now. I've been puffing off an e-cig I bought yesterday. I know my through the roof anxiety and utter sense of impending doom will pass. I know the hallucinations can't hurt me, and that they're not real, but did anyone else hallucinate when they quit? 

Edit: Thank you all for being so awesome, I had a bit of a breakdown when I got home from work this morning and called my head doc. I fell asleep before she called back but when she did, all was well. She told me that the worst is over. Here's to hoping she's right!

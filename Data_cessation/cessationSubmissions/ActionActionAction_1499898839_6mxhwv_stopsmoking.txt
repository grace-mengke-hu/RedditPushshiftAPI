I like the nicotine rush after stopping for a few days

I have quit many times before. At least 10 times. What makes me smoke again is the slight buzz you get when you smoke after a long time. And then I'm back to smoking a pack a day. 

I hate smoking now. And almost every pack is my last one. Till I buy the next one. 

I have just thrown out my cigarettes. But I know I will be craving the buzz in a few days time.

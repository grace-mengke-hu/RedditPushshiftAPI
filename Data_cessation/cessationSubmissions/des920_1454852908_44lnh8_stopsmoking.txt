A moment I wanted to share with you all for motivation!

Today is day 35 for me and my smoke free app no longer gives me daily missions so I do not get that daily notifier any longer. This morning while I was bored and staring at my phone I realized the app was still on there and that I hadn't checked it in two days because for two entire days I NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT CIGARETTES! And no, not even once. It is possible people. Keep pushing forward. One day at a time!!

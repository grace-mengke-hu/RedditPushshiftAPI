Couple Questions About Quitting

Okay, so I made a post about cutting down then quitting, and the response was unanimously "just quit." So that's what I plan on doing. But it also raised a few questions.

Pick a day to quit. I like this advice but not sure how to pick a day any recommendations on how far in the future? I guess tomorrow is the obvious answer but is there any additional advice such as "try to find a period when you're alone so you're not a jerk to everyone you encounter.

Make a quite smoking kit. I love this and want to hear your opinions on items to put in it. Currently I have "Sunflower seeds, gum, mints, toothpicks, stress ball" do you guys have any other good items? I'm a rather fidgety person and have a fidget cube already and use that a lot. So if you have any objects or activities you used to take your mind off smoking I'd love to hear them. Also I did DL an app and it has a nice little memory game to play so anything else like that kinda like freecell or minesweeper (I despise solitaire so don't suggest that).

Lastly: Falling off the horse? So say you go like 10 days without a smoke then have one with friends or when your drunk. Any advice with this, because I quit for like 12 days years ago, and I had one just one and I was back to being addicted. So I guess the obvious advice would be "don't" but if it does happen do you have any advice on mindset or what to expect if you have one casually?

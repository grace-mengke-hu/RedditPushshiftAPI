Did any of you have to give up anything else in order to quit smoking?

I've smoked a pack a day for roughly 6 years but tomorrow I'm going to try to quit. I know the cravings will be stronger when I'm having a coffee or go out drinking with friends, so should I avoid those things in the beginning? Did anybody have to completely give up something like drinking coffee in order to quit smoking for good? Any tips for my first day?

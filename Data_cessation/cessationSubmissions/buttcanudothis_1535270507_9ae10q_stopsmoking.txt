Well here goes nothing.

Well this is my third attempt of 2018. I did vaping the first try. Lasted 4 months and was super easy. But vaping is still smoking so it was easy to give up and get cigarettes. 2nd time was with the patch. Went about 10 days which was honestly a big achievement for me. So I'm going cold Turkey this time. Fuck smoking. I QUIT. Ive got a few action plans to execute to help me but please any advice is helpful and appreciated.

82 days!!

I tried to quit so many times but I LOVED smoking!  One bout of bronchitis and not being able to breathe to the point I had to go to the emergency room woke me up.  It is so difficult to quit but, I am so happy I did.  Every time I get the urge I just think about how much damage smoking does to my health and I dont do it.  I found a great app for my phone that keeps track of everything from the money I saved to the health benefits.  Good luck to all!!

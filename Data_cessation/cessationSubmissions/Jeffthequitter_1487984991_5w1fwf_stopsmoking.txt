I need a mental ashtray

Had a wonderful dinner tonight prepared by my wife and me.  My youngest daughter was with us.  Got out the china and had soup and a main course.  Delicious food and great company!
Now the dilemma--"How do I relish this experience without the need for an ashtray?"  Pause, breathe, close your eyes and let the temptation pass.  The experience doesn't need a tobacco crutch.  Put your temptation in the imaginary ashtray.
I made it through clean and kept my 8 day streak alive.
Thank God for all of your coping suggestions.  I raced through several of them tonight on my way past the urge to smoke.

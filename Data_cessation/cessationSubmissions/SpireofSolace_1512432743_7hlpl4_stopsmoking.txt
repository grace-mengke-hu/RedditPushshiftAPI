How do i stop smoking? I hate it.

So I'm 22 and I smoke about half a pack a day. I didn't start until recently (about a month ago) a co worker offered me one and then it just became a regular habit. I NEED to stop but can't. I have a kidney transplant and I know these cigarettes are gonna kill me at some point. I did chew and I much more prefer that than cigarettes. I just need an alternative. I've heard of vaping but I feel there's not enough research to say "Yeah, it's safer!" I mean I know nicotine can cause high BP, but so can sodas and coffee. What can I do?

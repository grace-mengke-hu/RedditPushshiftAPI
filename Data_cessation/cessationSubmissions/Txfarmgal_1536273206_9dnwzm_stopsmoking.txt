Dang, this better be IT

After way too long (trying to quit since April), countless attempts, excuses, days of self-hate, and failures, I smoked the last of the last pack at 4 pm CT today.

Dang, this better be IT.

My BIGGEST thanks and hugs go to my inspiring Quit Sister, who has supported me through this quitting extravaganza. I am immensely grateful to you. Thanks also go to UCanQuit Eric and WhiskeyRider for your honest and insightful feedback. I think y'all will understand this: I hope I don't have to thank you publically again -- because this will be IT, right? 

I believe we are all smarter than the addiction. 

Here's to our smoke-free futures!

Questions for those who have quit successfully

I am a 24yr old female, for reference. I guess I have always occasionally smoked since I can remember, but I picked up the habit as an all the time deal around 19 when my sister was diagnosed with epilepsy. Not blaming her, I am the culprit. I was at a weak point and it 'helped' me through it. Yes I am not retarded. Bachelors of Science. I know that smoking does not help you do anything but just giving you my thought process then. Forward to now. I know that smoking is affecting my health. I want to get healthy, in more ways than one. But smoking is quite difficult for me to quit. I understand its psychological and its an addiction. Part of me (large sadly) does not want to quit smoking. But I need to, in order to be healthy. I don't have the best genetics and I am torn. I am struggling. I am weak. I do not want nicotine supplements.

To my question: Has anyone tried hypnosis? Was it successful? Any tips with any other strategies? All advice is welcomed and appreciated. Thanks guys :)

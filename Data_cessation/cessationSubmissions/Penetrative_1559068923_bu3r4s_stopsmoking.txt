Staying Quit Amongst the Chaos

Please pardon me, as im in need of a little whine.  

I quit smoking approx 45 days ago.  

In that time
* Ive gained 18 pounds.  
* My husband was in a motorcycle accident &amp; broke his body.
* School is out &amp; summer began.
* Son's baseball season started, grass stains to contend with, games &amp; practice to keep up with.  
* Trying to maintain my existing friendships, while keeping up with family that is visiting.  
* Dr.  Appts for hubby, PT, OT, helping him do at home therapy.
* Taking care of my husband, not that he did much around the house before, but essentially its like ive added a child.  I need to pick up after him, I need to dress him, I need to administer his meds, hand over his meals, fluff his pillows, scratch hard to reach places.  Open up doors for him, get his ice, help him with shoes the list goes on and on.  Its exhausting.  
* Obviously my own child is ending up with much less guidance than he is used to.  Which has resulted in far more Youtube than I care to admit.  Im still running ragged trying to set up activities/playdates, and he has his friends over to our place and I take him to his friends' house too.    
* Then there is the property maintenance.  I pretty much always had the interior of the house covered.  Keeping up with dishes, cooking, laundry, floors, general organization/tidying, bed making etc. etc etc.  
* Only now, the stuff my husband was responsible for is on me.  Exterior maintenance.  Mowing, weed whipping, picking up sticks, picking up after the dogs/cats, watering, raking etc &amp; so on.  Im out of my element on this one folks.  My husband loved yard work &amp; wouldn't let me touch it.  I set foot in the garage and had to locate the mowers, see which ones worked, unburry them.  Check the oil, add things, tweak things.  Im not particularly mechanical or anything so this was an enormous undertaking for me.  
* Turned out the riders had mechanical issues.  I could not start them.  So I had to push mow over an acre, bagged it up, sprinkled it over the weeds as mulch.  

Finally finished and it was dark.  Everyone was hungry.  I had to go get DQ for dinner, cost $30 bucks to eat garbage food I hate.  Husband isn't getting a check these days.  Im sorting through medical bills trying to see what what &amp; if our supplemental is going to cough anything up for his absence.  

Plus, my husband quit smoking for a couple of weeks and then started back up again.  Is not interested in quitting, but seems to think him cutting back is enough.  Fine.  I accept, just another added stress for me being around you.  

Im just super stressed, im barely keeping my head about water.  Im so angry all the time, im so mad at my husband for so many reasons, he has not been an easy patient.  He is rude and short with me, and super critical, doesn't seem at all grateful of my efforts.  Sure I freaked out on him when i saw what a hoarder he was and how our garage is stuff to the ceiling with unidentifiable mechanical shit.  I deserved that freak out.  Literally risking my life &amp; limb trying to dig out the fucking lawn mowers.  Brown recluse, black widows, towers toppling over and crushing me, maybe tripping &amp; impaling myself on rods and hes like, "I never have any trouble getting it out."...Well, fuck, thats you.  Im in here up to my ears in God knows what trying to find a tool.  Im frustrated for me and you, im so mad that you can't see how ridiculous this mess is.  Im furious you think this mess is justified and important &amp; valuable.  How dare I criticize it.  I should just shut my damn mouth and mow and be grateful your alive.  I know.   

So, along with stressed, im angry.  I just want to run away.  This life fucking sucks.  

There, whine over.  Through all that ive still managed to stay quit.  

Not one puff, never again.  Never again, not one more puff.  Yea, something like that.

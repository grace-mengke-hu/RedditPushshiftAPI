So, apparently, quitting is fucking impossible?

I'm only hours into day 2, and I feel like I'm going to lose my mind at any moment. I'm being an asshole to people around me, and it's not fair to them, they shouldn't have to deal with the repercussions of my decision to quit smoking. I want to lock myself in a room and stay in the for weeks, in order to avoid being such an asshole to the people around me. I haven't slipped up and smoked, yet... But I am pretty close to not giving a fuck anymore. UUUUGGHHHHJH

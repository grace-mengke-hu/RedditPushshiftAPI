Just threw my last pack off my balcony.

Yesterday I went out and bought a Juul. I still had most of a pack left and I rationalized it, I said "I've already spent the money so I'll just smoke these and not buy any more."

Woke up this morning craving. The Juul wasn't doing the job quick enough and I really wanted to go light up. Instead I threw the pack into the woods behind my apartment.

I can do this. I have to do this.

It just dawned on me.

I haven't smoked since July 2017. It feels so good to think about this accomplishment, especially because of how easy it's been to not think about it. After smoking for a decade, upwards of 2 packs a day, to hardly remember my life as a smoker. 

I go out and never get cravings, I don't worry about falling off the wagon, I don't avoid smokers... I'm just a non-smoker. And that feels so wonderful to truly be able to say. 

So those of you just starting out, or struggling to get in the mindset, just know that you can absolutely be successful. Don't let the quitting become your focus. Just live your life. And live it without a pack in tow. Because before you realize it, it'll be a year and a half since you've quit and you'll be able to pat yourself on the back, then go back to forgetting all about it and just continuing on without them.

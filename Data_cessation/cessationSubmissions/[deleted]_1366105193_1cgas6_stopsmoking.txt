Beginning now

I've tried to quit several times within the last year, some times I was more motivated (and more successful) than others.  This time I feel like I'm in the right frame of mind to quit, but should probably drink and smoke weed as little as possible to aid the process.

Just felt like typing that out because it's another outlet for my thoughts during the quitting process.  Hopefully this will help keep me on track somehow.

EDIT:  Thanks to everyone for the support!  You guys rule.  I've since slipped up and am resetting my counter but I truly believe slipping up reaffirmed why I want to quit.  Here we go again!

Day 4, again.

So, I'm quitting again. Last time I was in anyway successful, my Father-in-law died and I fell back into it. Over the last year and a half, I tried using patches, gum, cold turkey, everything I could. Back in August, I started a new job with incredible benefits that covers smoking cessation. I decided to go with Champix (Chantix in the states, I think). It's working incredibly well, and I'm feeling about a billion and a half better. 
   I've been watching this subreddit closely since the last time I quit, and I was super jealous of everyone's progress. I'm back in the ranks and I really appreciate how supportive this group is. Congrats to all you who've made the jump, and good luck to everyone yet to do so.

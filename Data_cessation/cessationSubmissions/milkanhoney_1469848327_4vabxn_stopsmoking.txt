Just had my last one...

My hands are getting sweaty just typing this out but I want the last smoke I had to really be my last. It was over an hour ago and I'm already debating whether or not i really want to quit. I have kids, they are a reason, I don't want cancer or blood clots or any other smoking related disease, that's another reason. I hate the way my chest hurts when I wake up in the morning, I don't want to look 40 when I'm 30. But I LOVE smoking...I feel like I'm losing a very close friend right now. I've quit before(pregnancies) but never just quit because I felt the need to all on my own, it was always about someone else and I feel like all the very important reasons I've listed to quit smoking still aren't enough. Another issue, I lost a good amount of weight this past year and would be COMPLETELY devastated to put it back on, but if I'm not smoking I feel the need to put food in my mouth, which terrifies me and pisses me off<----makes me want a cigarette...HELP!

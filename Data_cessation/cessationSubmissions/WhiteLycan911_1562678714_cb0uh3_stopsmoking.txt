My head is tricking me with the good memories.

I'm probably just writing this, to get this stuff out of my head, before the real relapse happen. Currently I'm on 6 days smoke free, and the first full week is so close.

Everything has been great and reasonably easy, so far. Confronted a lot of people and situations for not smoking and physically I feel a lot better. 

However, I tend to be very insecure about things and smoking was a way for me to deal with it. It's the wrong way, I know this fully well, but it was a way. But on a personal level some things have gone a bit down, and they made me very nostalgic, to a long time ago, actually where I started to smoking in the first place. 

I made a lot of friends back then, and it was the first time I actually felt liked I belonged somewhere and for some stupid reason that's been linked to nicotine. I'm quite the introverted person and I hate group conversation and places with a lot of people. So often going outside, with one or two other people to have a smoke, were the kind of moments I felt like I was connecting to people, etc. And that kinda stuck with me as a way of connecting with people. But there's no use in staying nostalgic for things that were over 5 years ago.

And yet even now, I miss the more recent conversations in the pub, about making music, about helping the people get their mind right to picking up the things they've always wanted to do. The one on one moments in the smokers lounge/outside (I've also massively cut down on my alcohol intake).

So eventhough my body right now says, don't do it and I know that if I give in, I would be disgusted with myself and not even like it. That little nicotine infused voice in my head, is driving me crazy. =).

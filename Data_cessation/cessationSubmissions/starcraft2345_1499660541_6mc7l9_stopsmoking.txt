Question time! *stoners!*

So I'm quitting cigarettes obviously, but I'm still smoking herb and I'm not planning on stopping ever. ðŸ˜‚ Anyways, my questions: What are some of the positive things I'll gain from stopping cigarettes? Will I notice it because I'm still smoking weed? I'm planning on it to not be as exact as most cold turkey quitting stories go because I'm still technically smoking something.

One year

16 years as a smoker from age 15 to 31. I always said as soon as I have spent more years smoking on this planet than I have had smoke free years I would stop, I did this time last year and haven't looked back since. I had enough of putting that shit into myself. If you are trying to stop keep up, you will get there eventually.

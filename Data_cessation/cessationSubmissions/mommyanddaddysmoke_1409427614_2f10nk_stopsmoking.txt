Wife wants to have a baby...I asked her to quit before trying for a baby....is this unreasonable??

My wife wants to try for our first baby soon (as she's 32)...im scared about her smoking...she's been smoking for the last 12 years at between 10 sticks to a pack...     
my worry is that she won't be able to quit it during pregnancy and if it affects our future baby's health, I'm gonna be really saddened by it.    
I asked her to first quit and then we can talk about starting a family...in mind, I think I'm doing the right thing coz I can't imagine hurting the baby in any way due to our poor decisions...     
is this sort of demand unreasonable?? Pls help me...i only love her but don't want to be a jerk...     
I quit about 3 months ago and it was always at between 2-5 sticks....    

any opinions will be appreciated. Thx.

Slipped up after a month :( maybe I'm just destined to fail

I feel so hopeless.
It's been an extremely stressful month and after a night out with friends I let myself have a hand-rolled cig, or more like a half of it. I'd smoke even more if I didn't have to leave early. It still feels like a huge failure and I'm sick of myself. 

I tried googling similar experiences, but after a million articles telling I'm worthless and still going to die young I feel even less motivated to quit. Please help...

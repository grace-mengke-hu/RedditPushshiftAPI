Looking to quit cold-turkey. How can I resist the urge to smoke?

Ive been smoking on and off since I was 14. Picked it up heavily later last year when i was 19. I go through two packs a week and am sick of smoking as I want to start running again. 

The worst is when I'm in social situations. I hang around other smokers and my mom smokes too. I have bad anxiety and smoking helps me calm down(though im sure it actually worsens my anxiety..). 

This is a legitimate post and I'm looking for help. Thanks!

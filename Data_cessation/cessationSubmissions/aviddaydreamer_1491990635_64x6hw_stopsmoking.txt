Two weeks in...weird amount of congestion

Hi, everyone. I stopped around a fortnight ago and also adopted a generally healthier lifestyle. But for the past two days I have been suffering from crazy chest congestion and mucus build up. I used to run 5km by the end of last week now I can only do 3km. What's wrong? Has anyone else felt this way as well?

Day 3 question

So, by the end of day three, I’m feeling a lot better than day 1 &amp; 2. Like I’ve finally accepted that I will not pick up another cigarette (we are past that point). 

It feels good.

A few physical things— I’ve been playing wth my new found ability to breathe deeply (!!!), and I can inhale to my lungs capacity, but when I exhale everything out, at the very bottom of my exhale, it gets all gravely and gross, and sends me into a hacking fit. Is this emphazyma (sp?) ? Will this go away?

Anyone else experience this?

This morning I woke up with a sharp headache that lasted til about noon, and now.. the constant headache is gone! So that’s new.

Also I feel a little bit more positive and less irritable. Also, more creative! Which is weird. Like. I have more time to actually think about other things now that my time and thoughts are not all consumed about when I’ll get my next cig.

So, yeah, all in all, feeling good. I feel like I might have gone over a “hump” in this process! I’m sure there will be more hurdles coming, but this one feels notable and good!

When should I expect the next hurdle? I want to be ready! I’ve bought a jumbo pack of “halls” and have been popping those back if the cravings ever get too strong. 

Thanks for listening, everyone!

SOS

Yesterday I had dinner. I quit 24 days ago. I drank! And...... I can't say I needed to smoke it is just I wanted! I hate when that feeling come to my head. It is like the idea of smoking involves me and I have the feeling st that point I can be weak anytime. It is difficult to explain..... 

So the point is yesterday I didn't smoke. And today once the party is ended I fell happy and proud but also scared. Can things be different next time? Can the idea of smoking be stronger than me? I don't want to smoke , I really don't.... but in those situations.

Next week I have a party again. Some of my friends  smoke. Before I go to these parties I think about the situations that can make me feel I need to smoke and I have written how to act. Something like if this happen then I will.......

Today I feel weak. I am so scared of cravings

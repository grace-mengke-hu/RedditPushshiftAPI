My GF wants to quit smoking by using e-cigs, but we both have no idea where to start

I have heard that e-cigs have helped a lot of people wean themselves off smoking and it is relatively cheap to do so. However, I have seen some news stories about e-cig batteries catching fire/exploding/etc. Also hear that they break frequently, but perhaps that is just from misuse? What is a reliable brand that is still affordable? Also, we don't know what kind of juice to buy. Right now, my GF smokes between a half to one full pack of cigs a day. What "level" should she start at?  Thanks in advance for any help

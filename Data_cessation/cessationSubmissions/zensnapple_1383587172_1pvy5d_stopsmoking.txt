Two months!

Hey guys and gals! I just want to let everyone know how good it feels to know you've quit for good. Today is 62 days without any nicotine for me, and I feel great. My friend offered me a cigarette last night after a Pretty Lights show, and it felt amazing to say "Dude, thanks a lot, but i'm never going to smoke another cigarette again." The smile on my girlfriends face was priceless, and made me feel so proud of myself. I'm almost in tears right now just thinking about it. 

For those of you just quitting, it only gets easier to say no with time. I stopped eating red meat about the same time I stopped smoking, and at this point, it's way harder to say no to meatballs on my pasta than it is to say no to a cigarette. 

There is hope! I believe in you! I know you don't know me, but I love you, and want only the best for you, whoever you are. If you want advice, or someone to talk you out of having that next smoke, or someone to talk to in general, send me a PM, I'll do my best to help :)

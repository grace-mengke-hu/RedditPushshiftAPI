Resetting badge after 580 something days

It's easy to light up again no matter how long it's been. My husband started smoking again and I did really well for awhile. Then I just decided to have one with him. I smoked for a little over a week and am back on the quitting train. It happens. I'm picking myself up, dusting myself off and continuing my journey. Not going to lie, it was like I had never quit and was super easy to get right back in the habit. Although putting them back down is much easier since it wasn't very long.

Edit: Thank you all for the support. Learn from my mistake and don't bother with the "maybe just a little" or "I can handle just one". You probably can't. I know I can't. It's too easy to slip back.

So I made it to one week, but...

So until yesterday, I've bewn smoke free for a week (after 5 years of smoking around 1.5 packs a day). It hasn't been as hard on me as I expected, since I decided to quit smoking out of gagging around 3 times on my last cig. Not a lot of cravings, and those are ignored by just distracting myself. 

BUT... Last night I was out drinking with friends. Midway into being tipsy/drunk, I find myself unintentionally smoking a cigarette (if I recall correctly, a drunk friend of mine lit a cig and I was tempted to ask him for one (since I usually smoke like a chimney while drinking)). 

I've been feeling like shit ever since I had that cigarette. It felt disgusting yet perfect at the same time, and once I realized I was smoking, I immediately threw it away. But the cravings are now stronger. I thought I was able to control myself to get away from this addiction, but sadly my drunk mind forgot about my responsibilities. 

All I've been thinking about today is how much I *need* a cigarette. I feel my body demanding another smoke. Whenver I distract myself from the idea, I just find it casually returning into my mind. Does anyone have any suggestions? I had just made it to the point where the smell of cigarettes was starting to disgust me, yet now I'm begging myself for one. I was able to hang out with my entire group of friends, who all smoke, without even having the slighest craving. I feel disappointed because I really felt like I was able to go through this properly without any fuck-ups. 

I might be overreacting about this situation but I've literally been daydreaming about a cigarette since I woke up. I had plans with friends today but I'd rather keep myself at home, just to avoid any unnecessary smoking (and so that I'm not tempted to buy my own pack again). Any tips?

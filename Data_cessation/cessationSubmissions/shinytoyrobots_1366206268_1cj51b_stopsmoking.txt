I've discovered that breakfast is a great meal.

For years it's been "nasty taste in my mouth, make coffee, drink coffee with a cigarette".

Now I make myself a toasted bagel, maybe with Nutella, maybe with scrambled eggs, and some (better) coffee. Not only can I taste it better, but instead of wasting the time smoking in the morning before work, I can relax a little more over an enjoyable meal to set me up for the day.

I quit drinking and now I want to quit smoking.

I’ve been subscribed for a long time and now that I quit drinking I want to quit smoking. I thought it would be easy because drinking makes you want to smoke but it’s even harder because I rely on it to help feel normal without drinking. Is there a technique that’s not cold turkey that’s worked for you guys? Did vaping help?

So I guess I'm doing this.

So, yeah.  Smoked for 10 years, a pack+ a day for the last 2.  I'm done.  Just got canned from work, making some big changes here soon, and this is the first one.  I've always said I'd quit when I had a reason to, and well, this is a pretty fucking good reason, so here we go.  Don't really need to hear anything from anybody, I just need a place that I can put this down and tell someone who isn't family or friends.  They don't know yet but they'll figure it out eventually.  Man this is going to suck, but better things lie ahead right?

Anyways, just smoked my last one, l&m blue short, out on the front porch at 3:30 am.  And so it begins.

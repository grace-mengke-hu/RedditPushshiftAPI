I've broken half a pack of cigarettes

I'm trying a different approach. Instead of talking about what I want to achieve, I'm talking about what I have achieved.

Yesterday I broke half a pack of cigarettes in half, one by one. I am on my first day since I quit smoking. I do not miss it.

I'll report back on how it goes. I've faced bigger challenges in life.

Allen Carr book

Has anyone ever used Allen Carr's book "easy way" to quit smoking? I'm already halfway through but the fear and uncertainty of finishing the book and quitting smoking is really hindering my success. I want to quit so bad but I'm struggling getting through the book bc I'm scared it won't work for me.

I've quit several times I'm less than a pack a day smoker, been smoking for 10 years on/off (mostly on) and I quit when I got pregnant with my kids only to start up again bc my husband was still smoking and stress is my biggest trigger.

I feel like shit all the time, I'm having trouble breathing, and don't want to feel like this anymore. 

Any tips on working through the fear of quitting with the Allen Carr method?  What is the best way to read this book?

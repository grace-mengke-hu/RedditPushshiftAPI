Just had my last cig after watching the Allen Carr DVD, but there was one point i can't adjust my mindset to - any advice?

I can see why the book (or DVD for me) is so successful.  I will wake up tomorrow and realise it's the little monster in me needing to be fed.  Nicotine is a drug and killing.  I'm lethargic. My skin is bad.  I'm ready to stop. (Sounds kind of cult-ish when i read that back, but hey ho)

I agreed with all the points, but the two that i can't adjust my mindset to are

1. I like a cigarette with a drink

2. Smoking is a social stigma.

3. Smoking from boredom.

I guess the answer to point number 1, is tell myself that i only want the cigarette because i'm withdrawing and it's a habit?  But as for smoking being a social stigma, well, all the bars i go to, the smoking area is often the best place to be. It's loads of fun.  I don't see anyone that envies non-smokers and i strike up way more conversations with strangers then i would inside a bar where i hang with my friends.  Does anyone else feel this way?  I guess tell myself that when i get home i stink.  But i've also had a good time. The stink of fun. 

And boredom.  I get real bad urges to smoke in the evenings at home when i'm not stimulated.  And that was my favourite time to smoke. I guess stimulate myself more or tell myself it's the little monster again. (now that sounds cultish and porno-y).

Anyway, here's to day one starting tomorrow.  I'm ready to quit for my health, i just hope i can keep it up when i'm out, because every other point has resonated deeply.

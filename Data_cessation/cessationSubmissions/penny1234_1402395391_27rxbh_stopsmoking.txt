Today, I quit.

I am a very active 31 year old woman living in NYC and I'm tired of wasting all my money and putting my health in the gutter. I've been wanting to quit for a while but somehow I go out and end up smoking again. I woke up really early this morning with this urge to quit and I decided today would be the day. I rarely smoke in the morning and usually wait till afternoon/evening to smoke so it really will not get bad till later. Wish me luck!

Dealing with Cravings?

Hi, new here! I'm on day 9 of my quit - it was kind of unintentional. I was a 5-cigarettes-a-day smoker, I wanted to quit, and planned to, and then I got the flu and gave it up because no time like when you're already coughing your lungs out, right? It wasn't easy, but it wasn't impossible, either. I had some cravings, but they were mostly manageable.
However, for the last few days, I am obsessing about smoking. I don't really want to do it, I'm so proud of how far I've come, but this is not like the cravings I had before. I can't focus on anything else! I had some cravings initially and got through them using my Smoke Free app and some of the skills and distractions, but this is like a big, giant, constant one with only little breaks from it. I can't focus on school work, I can't even focus on a TV show to distract myself. I'm a little lost and don't really know what to do, here.
Any advice? Is this common? And for crying out loud, is it ever going to go away?

Quit day tomorrow

I’ve smoked for 35 years and it’s time to quit. Been planning for weeks &amp; tomorrow is my quit day. Have been in Zyban for 2 weeks (which seems to nothing except give me a constant headache) &amp; tomorrow morning, I put on a nicoderm patch. 
I’m fearing failure &amp; the cravings, but looking so forward to being a non-smoker. I’m determined for many reasons to stop this habit. Wish me luck!

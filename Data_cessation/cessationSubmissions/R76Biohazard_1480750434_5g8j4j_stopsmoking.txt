29 days in. Had a really strong craving tonight

You are bigger than your addiction.

I write this for all of you as much as I'm writing it for myself. 

I've been a smoker for 12 years. I'm 31 years old. I've watched my half brother and half sister mourn the loss of their father because he refused to quit smoking. I've enjoyed the company of my elderly neighbor in her nicotine soaked home before she passed from lung cancer. I've seen the pain that it had caused, I understand the logic of why it's bad.

But the cravings still beg me to have one. Just one. No one has to know.

My rational mind screams the reality of sobriety at me loud and clear, but that other voice is so charming and so warm.

My addicted mind which has been starved of nicotine for 29 days 2 hours 23 minutes and 48 seconds (but who's counting), encourages those warm smokey memories....
"Your girlfriend is asleep. Your friends aren't here. Your family is gone. No one will know. Go have a smoke, you need it... you deserve it."

FUCK. ALL. OF. THAT. NOISE.

I don't need it. I can't pretend that a part of me doesn't want it. A huge part of me does want it. That part of me is a short sighted asshat who deserves no attention. 

I am not saying that any of this will be easy. I know I will want to do the wrong thing at some point. The important part is that I will never be satisfied with myself until I become a better version of myself. 

I. AM. BIGGER. THAN. MY ADDICTION.

... and so are you.

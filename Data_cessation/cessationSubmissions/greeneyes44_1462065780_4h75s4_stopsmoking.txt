Stop smoking. Need help

I have stopped smoking for 4 1/2 years. The last couple of weeks I have started back. 1 or 2 every now and then. I have a e-cigarette called Blu. I am so unhappy now cause I shouldn't be doing this. Dad died last November with COPD. That should have been a reason to never start back. Why?

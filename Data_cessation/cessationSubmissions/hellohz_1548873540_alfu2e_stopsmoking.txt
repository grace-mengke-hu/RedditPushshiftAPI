Day 4... SOS

So I'm on day 4 of no smoking and I have been having the nicorett gum which seems to sort of work but my god I am IRRITABLE!!!

How long does this feeling last for?

Any tips?

I also don't think it helps that I did just really enjoy smoking but I always felt guilty afterwards as I know it has no real benefits... But obvs that I don't think that when craving bad.

Aaahhhh

1 year today

1 year ago today I started out with this sub after lurking for a while. I unsubscribed later because getting a reminder every time i hit reddit wasn't working for me. I still get cravings a couple of times a week, especially after a beer or two but using [chains.cc](http://chains.cc) has been an enormous help. And there it is in the sidebar. 365 days since I last had a cigarette. Thank you /r/stopsmoking and keep at it!

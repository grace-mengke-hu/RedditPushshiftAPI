Infections early on?

I am on day five, and my skin is a giant mess. I've read that it's quite normal, and I'm not terribly worried about that. However, some of my old piercings have begun acting up. Most painful is a nipple piercing, one I haven't had a piece of jewelry in, for over 8 years, that has swelled to double size and hurt worse than when I had it done. Does anyone have any experience with this? Can it be related to quitting? I quit once last year, that lasted a month, and had no problems. Not even the skin issues as I have now.

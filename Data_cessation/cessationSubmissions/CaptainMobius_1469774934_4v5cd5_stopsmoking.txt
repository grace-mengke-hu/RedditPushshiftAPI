Gross side-effect of quitting?

OK, fair warning, this is a really gross observation about a certain bodily function. With that said...


I've noticed something since I quit smoking - my shit smells decidedly different. Not "better" or "worse", just... different. I wonder if it's my sense of smell improving, or a result of a change in my body chemistry, or what. Anyone else notice this?

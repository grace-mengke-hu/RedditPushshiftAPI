Did I mess up my progress?

So I’ve been 3 weeks smoke free (yay!). Last night, I went over to a friend’s house. They smoke, but I did not. Shared the great news on my smoke free life. 

So anyways, they were smoking. I didn’t want one at all, but I’m scared being around it and potentially getting second hand has fucked the three weeks I’ve accomplished.

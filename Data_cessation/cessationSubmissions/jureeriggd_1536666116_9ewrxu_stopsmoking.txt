How do you deal with enjoying smoking?

Hi all, I just found this subreddit, and after briefly browsing, I wanted to ask this question.

Today I am 7 days smoke free. I was a smoker for 15 years.

I have made the conscious decision to quit, however, I really do enjoy smoking. I enjoy the smell, the taste, the physical habit, and the "cooldown" time.

I find it hard to take a break now, whether I'm working, at home, or whatever. I've only been able to just push through. If I take a break, I end up thinking about cigarettes, so I just don't do it.

Any advice for someone who enjoys smoking but wants to stay smoke free?

A list of things to remember

Hey, tomorrow it will be my first day as a free person and this subreddit already helped me a lot. I've been reading a lot of things these days and i've compiled a list of "things to remember" both from this subreddit and other sources. I'm sure it will help me read through this during carvings, i wanted to share this with you. Add your own in the comments if you want

> * Everything you are afraid of are just mental traps of an addict.
* You are literally not losing anything, only gaining
* You will have carvings for the rest of your life, or for three days. You choose.
* Just one cigarette means losing all the progress you have done until now
* Smoking is a chain. Each cigarette leads to the next, there is no cigarette without the next one. You just have to break the chain once
* A carving usually stops after 5 minutes and it's going to end either you smoke or not.
* Quit smoking one day at a time.  Do not concern yourself with next year, next month, next week or even tomorrow.  Concentrate on not smoking from the time you wake up until you go to sleep.
* If you encounter a crisis, (e.g. a flat tire, flood, blizzard, family illness) while quitting, remember, smoking is no solution.  Smoking will just complicate the original situation while creating another crisis, a relapse into the nicotine addiction. The car's tire will still be flat, or the bad news will still be bad, but now you will also be an addicted again.
* Ask yourself how do you feel about going back to your old level of consumption.  Smoking is an all or nothing proposition.
* NEVER TAKE ANOTHER PUFF! It only means you decide you really enjoy withdrawal and you want to make it last forever.
* Every day the ex-smoker should wake up thinking that he is not going to smoke that day.  And every night before he goes to sleep he should congratulate himself for sticking to his goal.  Because pride is important in staying free from cigarettes.  Not only is it important, but it is well deserve
* What you would think of somebody with an heroin addiction that will "just take another dose"?
* As strange as it sounds, withdrawal symptoms are good not bad for they are true signs of healing.
* Meet, greet and defeat your triggers. Don't hide from them. You need not give up anything during recovery except nicotine.
* Research suggests that the average quitter experiences a maximum of 6 crave episodes per day on the third day of recovery, declining to about 1.4 per day by day ten. If each crave is less than 3 minutes and the average quitter experiences a maximum of 6 on their most challenging day, can you handle 18 minutes of challenge?
* Really the only thing you have to remember is – zero nicotine into my body. That is the only rule. It can’t be broken and there is no way around it. No compromise is possible, it is totally non-negotiable and the key to success. Everything else needs to adapt to that.
* If you will smoke, or take a puff, again it will taste horrible. You will think "aha. It's awful. I'm not going to fall for this again", but in reality the addiction already come back and it's just a matter of time before you'll smoke another one.

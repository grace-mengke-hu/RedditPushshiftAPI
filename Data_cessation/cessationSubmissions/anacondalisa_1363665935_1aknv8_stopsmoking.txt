If you've got a few weeks of not smoking under your belt, cave, and smoke...you will not have a  cigarette buzz. I promise.

I had 23 days. After two days of straight stressful events I caved and bought a pack. I smoked four cigarettes trying to get that "cigarette in the morning," feeling. I did not get it. 

What I did get was a gnarly headache, dizziness, coughing and a feeling of disappointment in myself.

I'm bummed, guys. Time to reset the badge.

I am now on attempt two to quit. If anything, the relapse showed me how much I'm not missing.

I am confident this will be the last time!

Closing in on two months..

Yea, I kinda forgot I used to smoke and it's hardly been 2 months. It's surprising how something that used to rule over me since the time I used to wake up till I go to sleep could disappear. I don't know if I'll still be a non smoker a few months from now, but so far I've achieved the impossible in my books thanks to this subreddit.

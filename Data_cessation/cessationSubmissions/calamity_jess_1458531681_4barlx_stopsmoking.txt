48 hours into my first quit

Hello all.  Quick backstory: I'm 28, have smoked for three years.  Some friends smoked, I lit up with them casually, then started a soul-suckingly stressful job and it all went downhill into a half-pack a day habit from there.  I kick myself for starting when I should have known better. 

For the past two weeks I've tapered right down to half a cigarette a day, and then pulled the plug completely 48 hours ago.  I haven't had any wickedly bad cravings yet but I am jittery as all hell.  Leg tapping, pen chewing, pacing, cannot sit still.  Total inability to focus.  Good thing it's a quiet day at the office.

Looking forward to the end of this first week, but fully expecting things to get worse before they get better.  Any and all advice or comments appreciated.

3 Days In

I am 45 minutes from 3 days without a cigarette. I feel like this was the worst week to chose to quit, but I keep reminding myself that life will always be stressful, weather I smoke or not. So, why not let it be stressful without the cigarettes? My sense of taste and smell has already drastically improved and I'm past the worst of my withdrawal symptoms. Though out of nowhere my gums have started hurting. I'm not sure if it's linked to quitting but it doesn't matter if it is! I'm 3 days in and I'm not going back!

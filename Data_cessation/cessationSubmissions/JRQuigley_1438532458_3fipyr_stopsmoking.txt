3 weeks accomplished

I had always read that it takes 21 days to form a habit.  Knowing that, I told myself that if I could make it three weeks, then I felt confident of my success. 


Well, today makes three weeks nicotine free.  No patches, no gum, no electronics, no pipes, no quick puffs from friends.   Nothing. 


During this time, I went to a motley crue concert, and holy crap,the second hand smoke there.   

Odd thing, I still enjoyed the smell, just didn't want to smoke. 


On that same weekend, my wife and I stopped at a casino.  

Edit:  my toddler smacked the phone and submitted the post just now lol. 

Anyways, the casino.  I quickly volunteered to go to the non smoking rooms.   I couldn't believe how much snow was in there. 

I've also noticed my supersmell I'm getting.   I can smell smokers from distance lol.   And it's not always tobacco smoke I smell.   :)

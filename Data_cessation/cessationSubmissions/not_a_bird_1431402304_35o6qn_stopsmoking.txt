Question about Allen Carr's book

I've never posted here before, but I've always admired the overwhelming support in this community.  


After having read Allen Carr's book 3 or 4 times, I was able to stop for about 9 months.  I felt absolutely fantastic.  Those were the best 9 months I've had in a long, long, long time.  In a moment of weakness, however, I slipped up and smoked while out drinking with friends.  It all just sort of snowballed from there, and now I'm back on the wagon.  In the past few days, I've smoked almost an entire pack, dipped an entire tin, and have really become very discouraged to be honest.  I guess I'm just beginning to lose hope, because it seems like my best shot at ending this filthy, wretched addiction (Mr. Carr's book) has thus far not 100% worked for me.  I don't know where else to turn, and I'm starting to feel quite scared to be honest.


Has anyone here read the book several times before something finally "clicked"?  If so, I'd love to hear your story!

Reset my badge and ready to try again

I quit smoking and drinking for a solid 2 and a half months and everything was going fine until my friends asked me to go out drinking with them for my birthday. I should have said no but I hadn't seen them in a while and wanted to do something for my birthday instead of staying home all day. I was at the point in quitting where I was finally over the cravings. So we grab drinks and the next thing I know I'm buying a pack of cigarettes and right back to where I was again. Never again, this time I'm quitting cigarettes and never drinking again. Both of them are just poison that are good for nothing. They are for weak people who need vices and can't handle their problems face to face. No more, I am stronger than both cigarettes and alcohol. I will not drink or smoke with you today.

The excuses got me.

Every week goes the same for me. I want to quit but there's always something stressing me to not try if not being a complete excuse.

Before the work week it's "how can I make it through my shifts" and come the off time it turns into "well I might aswell enjoy my days off" if i
I don't immediately make plans to drink and 'just have the last few for the night' 


23. Anxiety. And a near empty wallet. I could use some tips and advice since no one I know is even close to wanting to quit as I am.

Day 3... Never desired a cigarette more in my life.

I decided to quit because I finally have a reason  to after 4 years of smoking. 



The reason is because I'm interested in this girl who wouldn't like smoking, and it keeps me from going to the nearest store and picking up a pack because I know she wouldn't approve. 

I've tried to quit before because a friend talked me into it, but I gave up after a month because I just didn't have a reason for myself to quit. 

So here's hoping that I can kick the habit for good, and I just wanted to say thanks for the motivation that this subreddit  has given me over the past 3 days.

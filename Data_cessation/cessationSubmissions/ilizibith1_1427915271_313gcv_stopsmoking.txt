Ten weeks ago today I was pretty grumpy!

Today I have no cravings.

Today I can watch full episodes of mad med without relapsing.

Today I can exercise full force without coughing up a lung afterwards.

Today I can go outside simply because I want to enjoy the warm weather. Not because it's time to smoke.


Today I am free.

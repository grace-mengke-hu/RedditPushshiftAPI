I'm effing pissed about relapsing

Some of you probably remember my thread from 23rd day, talking about occasional smoking. Yeah, I ended up relapsing that day after a 39 day quit, I think. 
Nevertheless I also feel like my relapsing 2 days ago will help me in the long run, since this is my first serious quit ever. I learned something. 

I'm having pretty mixed feelings right now, because this immense feeling of disappointment and stupidity also makes me extremely motivated about quitting.
In fact, I'm positive I will never go back to regular smoking. I never doubt myself from the beginning anyway.

I don't get bad cravings. Being at work is easy without cigarettes, just like most other things. Whenever I get a craving, I don't resist it. I let the feeling come and go. It's only a matter of minutes until I forget cigarettes again. 
My only problem is alcohol. But I will get through it, and do better next time.

Just wanted to type this out and share my feelings. Thanks for reading.

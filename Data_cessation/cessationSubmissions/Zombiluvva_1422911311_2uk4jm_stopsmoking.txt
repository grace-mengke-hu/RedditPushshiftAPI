28 days later....

Can't believe I've made it made it this far. There's been a few things that have surprised me. 
1.  My stubbornness has lasted - I'm so reluctant to put nicotine into my body
2.  The lack of feeling physically better - Id assumed that Id be breathing better,smelling better etc. instead I've been smothered with a cold that shows no sign of going away
3. How long this 28 days has felt. My god. It's been about three years long. 
4. How hard I've found this. Although I suppose it's not that big a surprise really. But I'm still here. Still not smoking. Mostly because the thought of ever having to do this again is enough to give me nightmares. 

To all of you starting - you can do this. I mean, I am. I'm here 28 days later. And I'll be here 128 days later too. And one of these days I'm gonna feel awesome that I've done this - I'm holding out for that.

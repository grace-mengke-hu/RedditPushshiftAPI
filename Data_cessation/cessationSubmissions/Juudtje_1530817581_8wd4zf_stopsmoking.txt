Day 4: Went home sick

I didn’t think it was going to be this hard. Like the title says it is day 4 today and went home sick, because I almost fainted and threw up at work.

On a positive note, I don’t want to smoke because of the nausea. But stopping is a lot more draining then I thought it would be. There aren’t a lot of ex-smokers in the office, only smokers or non-smokers. So I have the feeling everyone thinks I’m over reacting... Just hoping it gets better tomorrow. 

Tips are welcome!

5 minute hobbies?

Hey guys, i'll try and keep this to the point but I've only just found this Sub so figured I'd do a quick intro. I'm 21, smoked since 15 and having spent over a quarter of my life smoking I'm sick of chest pains, heart palps and generally being tired from movement. I've tried stopping many times, used gum, patches, e-cigs and nothing's ever been a true substitute. 

One thing I'e noticed about the times I try and stop smoking is that the urge is 100000x easier to ignore when I'm pre-occupied. Especially with multiple small tasks, as I can say "Well, maybe after this one" and then start the next before my urges remember. I'm finding smoking to be like 35% craving, 65% habit. It keeps me occupied, it breaks up m day, I gives me something to do while out with the dog.

Does anyone have any suggestions for short little hobbies that I can do when I crave a smoke? I say short because I am quite busy with Uni work so don't want to take on a big project, but rather have a quick thing to do rather than smoke to break up my day.

Hope this made sense, cheers!

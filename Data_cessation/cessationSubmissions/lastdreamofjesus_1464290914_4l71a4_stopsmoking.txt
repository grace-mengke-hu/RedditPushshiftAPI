Is this the right time to stop smoking?

Hey there!
I want to stop. Really do. Or do I? I hate the smell, I hate that my social life is affected (years ago most of my friends did smoke, now I am basically the only one, so it's me all alone standing outside, people have to wait for me...),I hate how expensive it is and that I feel stupid. I don't think it is cool or sexy, I know I am dumb for doing it.
But I love my first smoke in the morning, I love my smoke after I had dinner, I love to smoke in the sun with my coffee. And I need to smoke when going through stressful events. I will be flying to the US soon, roadtrip with all non-smoking friends. 13h flight. I want to stop before, I want to be smoke free then. But I'm having a super stressful time, do my driver's license right now, and I'm scared of driving so this is actually me needing a cigarette every two seconds. But if I don't stop right now, I feel have a really bad cold turkey time in the US - which was supposed to be a fun time.

What do? Keep going so I manage to get through my driver's license but hate myself on our journey? Can you recommend patches? I want it to stop. :(

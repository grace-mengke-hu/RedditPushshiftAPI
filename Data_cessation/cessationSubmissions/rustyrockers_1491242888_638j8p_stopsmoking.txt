Question about vaping to replace cigarettes

Just curious how many of us have successfully switched to vaping, and then eventually tapered off the vaping as well? 

I used to smoke 20-30 cigarettes a day, and quit last December. I started vaping with 20mg nicotine content juice (the highest I could find)

Month 2 I downgraded to 12mg nicotine.
Month 3 I stayed at 12mg.

Just recently I downgraded again to 6 mg nicotine. 

Anyone else doing this? And did you downgrade all the way to zero nicotine and then ultimately quit vaping as well?

Any and all thoughts welcome. Thanks guys!

Two Months!

Wow - I can't believe it's already been two months! 

I feel such an increase in my energy levels and my mental focus.  I feel more present in my daily interactions with my friends and peers, because I'm no longer wondering when the next time I can smoke is, or if I smell like smoke, etc.  I can actually focus on personal conversations which has really helped me with strengthening my relationships with people.  

Keep up all the good work! It's easy, and anyone can do it.  Stay positive and stay quit!

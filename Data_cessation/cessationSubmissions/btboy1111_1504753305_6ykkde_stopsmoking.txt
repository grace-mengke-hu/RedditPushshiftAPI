Planning to quit for good.My 3/4 try. Just one thing bothers me...

So im a 24 y/o dude who started smoking last year and this September its been one entire year that I've been doing it. I started because my ex used to sit right next to me at our place and smoke I just somehow picked it up. I smoke like 4-5 cigarettes(not packs) a day. In this one year I have tried to quit 3-4 times and havent gone for more than 20 day before slipping back. The thing that messes with my mind is that 
1. What if my entire life I feel like im missing the cigarettes.
2. I feel even if I quit ill slip and start smoking when I drink( I dont want to quit drinking, i dont it that much either just a few beers once a week)

The first point is more of a inhibitor in my decision to quit. On the back of my mind I do feel i havent smoked for a long time so it'll be easier but still. Some advice anyone?

Real Quick: How to update counter?

Hi, friends. I can't for the life of me figure out how to update my flair/counter with the new configuration of reddit. Can someone tell me real quick how to go about this? Seeing my old counter from my last (eventually failed) quit is...demoralizing. I'd love to get it current.

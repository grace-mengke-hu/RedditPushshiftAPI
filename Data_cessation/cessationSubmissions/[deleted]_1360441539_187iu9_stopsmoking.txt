I live with smokers, today I start my weaning program.

Hey guys, today I start my weaning process.

**The History**

I have tried cold turkey about 5 times and I needed a new plan. I can admit I lack some will power. 

I stopped smoking cannabis about 14 months ago, Cold Turkey. I knew it wasn't good for my short term memory or my lungs. I used cannabis as an emotional crutch, much like nicotine, and it helped me deal with my constant anxiety. 

I stopped drinking in excess after I realized what kind of monster I turn into when I drink. I drink socially on occasion but not at the frequency I used to (also I consume about a third I would consume when I would go on a bender). I was never really an alcoholic but I did abuse it.

Smoking is where it all started for me. I was living at a group home, an institution for problem children. While I was a meek in many ways I didn't like cleaning my room, so they sent me to a new group home that had recently transformed from a open custody facility for youth to a "Independence Program". Needless to say it wasn't as all the staff were used to be corrections officers to some extent and I was one of their test subjects. 

I started smoking as a stress reliever, living in a home with 5-9 other youth who had been to *Juvenile Detention Centers*, behavior treatment group homes, foster homes and other various institutions. Most of us had been through shitty experiences and I was one of the ones that was a Crown Ward (or ward of the state).

I started smoking both for social reasons, and as a stress reliever; smoking was a great escape from the institution. I could be 100 meters away and actually let my constant anxiety wash away, I was hooked immediately.

7 years later here I am, smoking out of habit and using it as my emotional crutch. It is not as bad as 3 - 4 years ago but now I live with smokers twice my age. They will smoke till the day they die and I have to deal with it. They encouraged me when I showed them my plan but I did not even ask to stop around me, they are stubborn vets and I love them. 

**The Plan!^Plan^Plan^Plan** 

I have ONE Carton in front of me. I went from smoking a Carton in 8 days to 2 cartons in a month.

My plan is to stop in 31 days

I start with 10 smokes a day, on the fourth day I drop it too nine

Every three days I decrease the number of smokes I have by 1.

on the 30th day I throw out my ash trays and get rid of all receptacles. 

On day 31 I start counting. 

**What I Need**

Some basic support, I'm not talking about crisis intervention or someone to talk to on the whim. I don't have any close family and many of my friends at school are smokers.

If it is OK with the mods I will try and check in with once a week or so (probably longer) until it I am on day 30.

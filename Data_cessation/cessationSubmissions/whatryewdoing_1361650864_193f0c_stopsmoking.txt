Day 5

Today is day 5 and I'm having a really hard time. I keep trying to come up with excuses so I can smoke. Like I read online that it usually takes 4 or 5 tries to successfully quit.. So since this is my first try, it's okay if I fail. Or I'll just smoke one and keep quitting. I know at this point it's all mental. And all it takes to quit is to just not smoke and I know it only gets easier with time. I made a list of all the reasons why not smoking is awesome. And I love not smoking. There are so many benefits so far. I know being a non smoker is infinitely better than being a smoker.. But I still want a cigarette! And today I can't seem to shake it.

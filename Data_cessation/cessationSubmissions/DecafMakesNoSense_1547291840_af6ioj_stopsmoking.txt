Smoker for ten years now.  Wow, how did that happen?  On average, a pack a day.  Weekends when drinking, different story.  I LOVE cigarettes in the morning, but after noon and into the evening, I think I do it out of boredom.  I work from home, live on the beach.  I love to take a short break from work, sit on the balcony, watch the waves, and "enjoy" a smoke.  Sometimes I think it's just the distraction from work as opposed to the nicotine addiction, but I could be wrong.  Any advice on how to take and enjoy a break sans that fucking evil fucking drug called nicotine?

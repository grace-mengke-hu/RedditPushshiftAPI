I was pissed and I still didn't smoke!

While dropping my SO off at work this morning, we got into an argument. I'm not a morning person AT ALL [much less at 5:30 AM] and so I went into full-on rage mode. Normally, my response would be to chain smoke so I wouldn't commit [justifiable] homicide. I could have gone to the store and bought a pack. I could have bummed one from a co-worker [they all smoke]. But I didn't. Now I'm still irked at him but at least I didn't give in!

I want to forget I ever smoked

I deeply regret taking up the habit, now that I really understand how hard it is to quit and all the side effects, and tricks that my mind plays on me... 
I despise cigarettes and see them as nasty as they are and nothing more. I can't wait until they become a very far away memory in the past. I'm not giving up now, or ever.

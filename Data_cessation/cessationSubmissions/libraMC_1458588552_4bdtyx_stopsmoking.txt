A bit drunk and I really want a cigarette!

It's been very easy to not smoke lately but right now i'm in a pub with some friends and one of them smokes. It's really hard to not bum one from him but I need to stay strong, I've made it this far and don't want to stop again. Maybe I'd enjoy a cigarette right now but I know that afterwards I'll feel like a failure. We've got this guys, stay strong!

Edit: I'm home now and didn't smoke a cigarette! It really helps to post on here, just to remind myself that I will never smoke a cigarette again. Have a nice and smoke free evening guys!

Really want to vape

It's been 51 days since I last had nicotine, but for some reason this week has been excruciatingly difficult. I've been craving vaping, and cigarettes all week long, and had a dream about vaping last night. These cravings are stronger than the ones I had in the first week or two - when will these end? This shit sucks, and frankly is driving me nuts.

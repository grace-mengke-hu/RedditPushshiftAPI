Stress Smoking.

So I used to smoke about between 6 and 8 cigarettes a day, nothing too terrible, but enough that I wanted to stop. I quit cold turkey and did not really have a problem doing it, except when I get exceedingly stressed. For three weeks now I have been able to get passed everything but stressful situations.

I have anxiety issues and I got passed them, I can handle the cravings, I can even handle being around others who are smoking but I have caved twice due to stress. Once was just a few minutes ago. I keep no cigarettes on me, I bought a pack, smoked 2/3 of one, and pitched the rest.

I know objectively that my reduction is very good for me, and I feel phenomenal and that in the grand scheme 2 cigarettes in three weeks is nothing compared to where I was, but I still want to get passed it.

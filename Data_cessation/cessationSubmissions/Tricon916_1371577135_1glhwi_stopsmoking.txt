Its been 2 weeks, but...

Why haven't I coughed up anything? I haven't smoked a cigarette in 2 weeks, I've used an Ecig to control cravings bit in already barely using that thing, maybe used it once yesterday. Shouldn't u have better sense of smell and feel clearer lungs by now? I haven't coughed up anything at all?

2nd time around. Will withdrawal be as bad this time? (Vaping)

I was a cig smoker for a little over a year pack a day. Back in 2016 I quit over night by vaping. That lasted for about a year. 6 months ago I quit all together absolutely no nicotine of any kind. 3 weeks ago I stupidly picked my vape back up. Luckily I haven’t smoked any tobacco. But I’m refusing to let myself go back fully into my addiction. Today I’m putting it back down.

My first full nicotine quit was pretty bad to be honest. I had a rough few months. To those of you who had a successful quit and then stumbled for a few weeks, how bad was it the second time?

Natural side effect of quitting?

I quit smoking about four months ago. For the most part the withdrawal symptoms ended months ago but my temper has been getting steadily worse. I don't know if maybe that's my brain going back to normal or a longer lasting withdrawal. Anyone know anything about this, or have some advice?

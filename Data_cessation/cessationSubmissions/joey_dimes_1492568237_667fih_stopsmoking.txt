24 hours down...need help staying strong.

I am in my early 30's and have been smoking since college up to about a pack and a half a day. It's something I do when I wake up then driving on the way to work. I usually am stressed and what to get away from work so I usually drive to a parking lot and chain smoke during lunch and listen to podcasts. Driving home then letting out the dog every time is at least a few cigs. I have tried quitting multiple times I am 24 hours in currently and just trying to get support all around me. My problem is I am all or nothing like I wake up in the morning and am like I am not going to smoke today I will eat healthy and workout after work. SO that is what I tell myself them it could happen in 20 minutes I have stopped got a pack and picked up McDonalds breakfast. My mind is good at tricking me into thinking so dumb like making dumb deals in my head. I know its stupid but its a constant cycle then it makes me feel depressed and shitty that I don't have control over myself so then I eat and smoke more to feel better. I am 24 hours in and trying to figure out how I can keep going and advise on not making dumb deals with myself.

36 hours

Feels like a never ending bad trip. Feels like hours go by, I look at the time and it's been minutes. Thank god I don't have to see anybody or do anything for a few days. I'm really out of it. It's like a horror movie. Even though you're terrified you've just got to watch till the end... haha.

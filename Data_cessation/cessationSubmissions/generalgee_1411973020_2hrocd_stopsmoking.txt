120 days to waste?

Hello,

Today is my 120th day smoking free without a gum or anything, I just decided to stop and it was like the 4th or 5th time I quit in my 15 years of smoking, I jog, walk and play soccer, still my life career wise felt apart due to some silly decisions I made earlier this year which affected my whole life.

This is it... I need a smoke... I need a cigarette guys... am losing it... Not gonna happen, but still I always think that am going to lose this battle... but I wont... and you guys dont! this is just one of the many days, and this is endless believe me... never fall for the first week is the hardest week and so on... it will take years and you will have your downs... but always keep the right mindset and you will be fine!

What finally motivated me to quit - taxes!

I smoked for 5 years. Over the years, I tried quitting many many times, but I could never last a week because I didn't really want to quit. I didn't care about health or the money.

Then, about two weeks ago I read that 80% of the price of a cigarette pack is a tax. 80% ! I hated the idea of giving those thieving fuckers any more of my money. So I quit, and am 8 days smoke free.

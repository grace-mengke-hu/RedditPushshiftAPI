Just realised im over a month!

Hi all,  

Hope everyone is doing well. Just realised I'm 32 days...  I say just realised because I'd totally forgotten I used to smoke over the last week or so... the cravings are hardly there now.  I feel great!  

I've been going to the gym for 2 weeks and I actually smell... nice...!  

To all you people worrying in your 1/2/3rd day, don't worry keep fighting. You'll laugh after 2 weeks when you realise you didn't think about smoking for a day!  

Good luck everyone with their journey.

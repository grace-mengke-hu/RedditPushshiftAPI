This is your sign :)

Just wanted to join the conversation after I haven't smoked or touched nicotine for the last two years or so. Funny enough that these types of encouraging posts helped me a lot back in the first few weeks of quitting, so this might be useful for someone. (I wached Elementary and got to the part when Holmes is lectured that the anniversary is not about him but others.) Easyway was my method. Remember: it IS getting easier and easier, each day, each minute. I can now say that I am completely free and this was one of my best decisions. Keep going ;)

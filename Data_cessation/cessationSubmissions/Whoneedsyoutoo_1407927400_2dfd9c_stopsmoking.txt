Why is this sub so anti e-cigs? Surely if someone finds a way to quit its valuable to share how

Reading through this sub, all I see is down voted comments when people mention they quit using NRT. This method may not be for everybody but it is perfectly valid that if SOME people, even one person, manages to stop smoking using NRT then it is worth people sharing their experiences with it without being down voted into oblivion. Personally, I smoked 40 a day for 12 years. I thought I could never quit. I tried everything from patches to cold turkey and I never lasted anymore than 5 or 6 damn days. A friend of mines bought me an e-cig as a birthday present as after using it for just over two months I stopped using it all together. Here I am a year later nicotine free and feeling fantastic. 

Different methods work for different people and while cold turkey works for some E-cigs saved my life so please support people giving up no matter what their chosen method is, they have already made a courageous decision and should be praised for it, not hated on.

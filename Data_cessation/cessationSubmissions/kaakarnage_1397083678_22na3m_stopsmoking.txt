New to subreddit, looking to quit in a few days.

Hey guys. 

I'm broke, and against my better judgment, I bought what I hope to be my last pack. 

Girlfriend hates that I smoke, and it's hard because I live with a heavy smoker. 

I've been smoking on and off for three years, and at the age of 25, it's just time to quit. 

I'd still like to be able to have cigars and stuff when I drink, but I don't want to get hooked again. 

I'm already fat, and I've been scared of the weight gain. 

What are your best tips and tricks, what's helped you, and most of all, what helped you not gain weight?

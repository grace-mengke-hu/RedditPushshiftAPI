I think it's about time I finally stop this back and forth minor adiction of mine.

Hey guys,

I've been an off and on smoker for the past six or seven years, the vast majority of that time being a non-smoker.  Having said that, over the past year and a half I've had a really hard time staying off them for good.  The thoughts of smoking creep in more often, and I no longer have anyone in my life (speaking of a previous relationship) there to make sure I don't relapse.  

So, I'm making this post -- sort of to help cement it in my mind that I'm done for good.  I'm done romanticizing cigarettes and smoking; I'm done spending money on them and feeling like shit for the week or two that I spend smoking again.  I'm done.

Thanks for reading.

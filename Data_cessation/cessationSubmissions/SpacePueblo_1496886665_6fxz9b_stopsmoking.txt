Stopped smoking over a year ago been having fanciful thoughts of smoking...

I stopped smoking in April of 2016. I Read EASYWAY and never went back. In my heart of hearts I don't ever want to go back to smoking. BUT: 

In the spirit of sharing with other exsmokers and others that are trying to quit, I came here to share that lately the thought of going back to smoking has been popping up randomly. I wanted to see if anyone could relate. I thought smoking was a closed chapter in my life, but it's been rearing its head.  

 I should also add that I stopped smoking before I got sober. After I stopped smoking it took another 7 months for me to finally get into recovery for alcoholism. I've been sober for now for almost 7 months. Before I got sober, I saw my quitting smoking as a huge accomplishment. I felt really good, I had, money, all those good things, but I was still an alcoholic and doing shitty alcoholic things. So now that I'm sober I wonder if all those good things were actually good or not. It's hard to talk about these things in recovery because they don't see smoking as a big deal and sometimes even encourage it. Any help is appreciated.

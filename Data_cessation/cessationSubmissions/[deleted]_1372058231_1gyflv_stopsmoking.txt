Quit 4 days ago...terrified of weight gain.

Hey ya'll, 


I just quit smoking after a 5.5 year stretch ranging from half a pack to a pack a day. I've coped with stress by overeating in the past and would like to think I have it under control but I've never tested this theory while being cigarette free. Unstoppable weight gain is terrifying to me - not terrifying enough to continue smoking, but scary as fuck nonetheless since losing weight does not come easily. 

SO - any methods here to keep my mouth and hands busy? Even as a temporary measure? Theoretically I know that having more energy will increase my chances of being more active but in reality I've been ingesting an appetite suppressant for nearly 6 years and stopping is bound to have some negative repercussions. 

Thanks in advance everyone!

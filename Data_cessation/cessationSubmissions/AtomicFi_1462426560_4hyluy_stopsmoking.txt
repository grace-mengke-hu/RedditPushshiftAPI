Excited to quit.

I've been smoking for four years now, and I've quit two times before, more for convenience than because I wanted to. I've always loved smoking even though I've lost grandparents to it, but I could never find the motivation to properly quit. The two times I stopped were for about 3 months each, but I was smoking less back then.

Currently, I'll burn through 12-40 cigarettes on an average day. If I'm working, I tend to smoke less. After a friend managed to drop the habit by vaping, I caved and bought one for myself.

In two weeks I've managed to drop from my half to two pack a day habit to about four cigs a day. Granted, I'm still getting nicotine from the ecig, but I've got it running on the lowest mg/ml you can get. I'm excited with my progress. But I guess I'm just looking for a slight push from somewhere to really drop those last 4.

I don't know why I'm finding it so hard to stop, but I feel almost sentimentally attached to smoking. It helped me and my mom grow closer and just generally being a smoker has led me to meeting friends I still talk to daily.

Apologies for the wall of text, but you all seem like a damned great community, and I'm excited to join.

If anyone had similar difficulties, please share. I'd love to hear how you got through it.

My first 24 hours nicotine free.

At first, my body ached and it felt like I was sunconciously thinking about smoking but discarded a second later because I reminded I quit. Seemed to come about because of the habitual nature. A couple of hours after I woke up, felt like someine over filling my lungs. Headaches and stomach aches. About half way through my day, my breathing was better and I had more energy. My body and head ache a little still but nothing like it when I was smoking.

Those who have vaped to quit smoking, how long did you take to move down to 0 nicotine?

After many previous quit attempts that lasted from weeks to months, but always resulted in a return to the ole ciggies, I've switched to vaping. I had been smoking a pack a day (for 23 years or so), so started on 18mg nicotine. Am down to 12mg after just 2-3 weeks, and finding it fine. Liking the taste of vaping much more than cigarettes, and although it most likely isn't *harmless*, it's definitely a *better* option than what I was doing. 

I plan to slowly move down to 0 nicotine and eventually off it altogether. Keen to hear others' experiences with this.

I know not everyone in this sub thinks this is a "valid" way to quit smoking, but please keep the comments helpful. Whatever works for you, I say. Thanks.

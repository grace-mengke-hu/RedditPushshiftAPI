I was such a little whiney B!

Ok guys, according to my badge if I didn't start smoking again I would be 184 days smoke free today. I caved probably 5ish months ago. I didn't want to quit at the time. I had every reason in the world to start smoking again (or so I thought), so I did. I picked right back up where I left off, and I honestly enjoyed it for the time being. What changed my mind? I don't know, I woke up this weekend and literally had a cigarette hangover. I'm so f'ing over it. I'll be 30 in March and it's really starting to hit me that I've been smoking for 15 years. GROSS. I'm also starting to go somewhat vegan and I can't comprehend eating so healthy and ruining all of that with cigarettes. 
I threw on a patch this morning, restarted my "Smoke Free' app and decided to become active on this thread again. Hopefully without being such a whiny b**** about it. I feel that I have a much better  attitude this time around. I feel much more ready to kick this addiction in the ass than I ever have been. IM DONE!
(I'm also getting my badge reset asap!)

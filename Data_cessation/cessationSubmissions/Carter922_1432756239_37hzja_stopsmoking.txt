Day 1: Take 2

My New Years resolution was to quit smoking, which turned out great for about a month then my girlfriend dumped me and it all went downhill from there. I'm determined to stick to my word this time and say that May 27, 2015 at 8:30 am is the last time I will ever smoke a cigarette.

These next couple days are going to be rough.

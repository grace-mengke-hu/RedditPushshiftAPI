24h Without Smoking

Hello StopSmoking,

Just made it through the first 24h without smoking cigarettes.

Since my main focus is to finally stop poisoning my body by smoking I decided to use a Vape-Pen as NRT and it works really well, even though I still get the occasional cigarette-craving, but it is easy to get over it using the vape.  
I will check in later on and  I´m convinced to be able to abstain from smoking tobacco from now on.

My intent is to taper down the nicotine in the vape-liquid at some point but I don´t want to make a hassle out of it.

Not smoking is enough of an achievment for my for now.

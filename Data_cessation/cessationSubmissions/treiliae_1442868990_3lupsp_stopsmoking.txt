Got prescribed Wellbutrin for depression. Cigarettes are gross now.

On about day 4 I noticed that cigarettes weren't really giving me any kind of buzz anymore, so at first I smoked more to try to compensate. Then they started tasting disgusting. So I made the decision today that I might as well not smoke because it's pointless, and since I'm taking the buproprion therapeutically, I'd imagine I'll be on it for at least a year rather than the 12 weeks or so with Zyban.

Still want a cig for the habit but I just keep telling myself that it really will do nothing because those receptors are all busy with the buproprion. I need to get some straws or a 0 nic ecig to suck on :)

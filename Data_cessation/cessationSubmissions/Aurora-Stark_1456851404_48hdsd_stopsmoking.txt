Arghhhh!

I slipped up AGAIN ðŸ˜• 

Been taking codeine for pain and after a few weeks i've started reducing down because don't want to get really addicted. Have been getting some withdrawals with meds and i've not been able to stop thinking about smoking, i went right out and got some tobacco today and have smoked two *sigh*.

Kicking myself.

All advice and support much appreciated.

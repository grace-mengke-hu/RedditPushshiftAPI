Best advice to get over the 'need' hump?

I've been smoking tobacco steadily for about 5 years. I've attempted to quit on several occassions, but I have fears every time - May it be that I'll gain a stupendous amount of weight, or that I won't be able to get through work with my normally sunny disposition...I need to quit, though, and my brain knows this. My father passed of lung cancer in '03, and I consider myself a singer and someone who wants to make money with his voice in the future...I'm really having the most trouble getting through "Day One" of quitting. Any tips from fellow quitters?

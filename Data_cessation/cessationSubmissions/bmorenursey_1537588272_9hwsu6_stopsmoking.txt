5 months quit, feeling like a real non smoker earlier than I thought I would

I started when I was 14 and smoked about a pack a day for about 15 years. 
For a month after I quit, cigarettes were the first thing on my mind every morning no matter what. 

For the first few months I still thought about them all the time. 

 Its possible cigarettes didn’t cross my mind at all one day a couple of weeks ago, but I can’t remember every single thought I have in a day so I’m really not sure. 

3 days ago, I thought about cigarettes a bit more deeply than I have in awhile when I smelled one in the rain and it gave me the warm fuzzies of nostalgia. And I asked myself why I didn’t just have one... at this point it probably wouldn’t do anything for me, but there’s obviously a small part of me that wants one and what’s wrong with that? Of course there’s a risk it will bring back that needy feeling I tried so hard to defeat, and I might just be hooked again and buy a pack and have to start all over.  If I have one now, I might think about cigarettes all the time again, and not just when it rains. I’ll have to smell like this when I go back to work...

It was easy it was to talk myself out of wanting/having one. 

Thinking about them was never really wanting them- even on day 3 or week 3 when I thought about them constantly. Cravings are chemically induced thoughts. You can’t really stop them if you truly want to be free from addiction, you just have to reframe each and every one of those thoughts until some time passes and you only have to reframe 1 thought a week, not 50 thoughts a day. 

I was so afraid that it would be too hard to quit and I would fail and end up being lifelong smoker anyway so I never tried. And now that I’ve done it I’m proud of myself- not even for quitting but for believing I could in the first place... and I believe in you too!

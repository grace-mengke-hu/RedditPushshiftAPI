Day 2 smoke-free

Hello community- today I'm smoke-free as I was yesterday and its been tolerable. Sometimes I wonder what's the point given that I have relapsed many times before, yet for some reason, this time I really want to stay quit. Been a smoker for 8 years.

I haven't really told anyone about my decision because I realized that when I announce things, it's almost always a given that they won't happen. I do want to share it with all of you. 

My hair was smelling horrible and so was my body odor in general. 
I went to the dentist and witnessed all the stains from chain smoking and felt disgusted with myself.
Not so lady-like of me. 

Honestly I just want to leave this putrid addiction behind, or at least keep it on mute. 2 days gone by and food already has a different taste. My lips aren't cracked anymore, nor is my breath repelling. 

I really want to stay on this path.

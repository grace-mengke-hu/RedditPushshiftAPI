How to stop smoking at certain places?

Hi. So I usually smoke with my friends at the university, when I'm drinking, when we're out. I can "resist" in the last two situations, but in the university I'm used to smoke a pack everyday. I was on vacation, and didn't really left my house, I didn't smoke for one month (except one concert where I just said fuck it, let's make an exception). I didn't really felt the necessity to smoke until I was out of my house. Didn't even think about it. But now I have to go to the university again and even before being there, I said wtf I'm I gonna do alone at the university (my friends were not going) and bought a pack before going there. I think my brain somehow "links" the university and smoking. Also, a lot of people in my career smoke so that could be a problem. Any tips? (I just turned 18, started smoking at 16, I may be a little young but it's a common thing here in Mexico sadly..)

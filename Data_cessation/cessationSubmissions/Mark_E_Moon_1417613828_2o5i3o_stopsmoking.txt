Sense of smell returned; mind blown

16 days off the butts, after 14 years of heavy smoking

I feel like a blind man who can see again regarding my sense of smell.

The first thing I noticed was how STRONG tobacco odor is on others when you aren't saturated with it yourself.

A few more days and the floodgates really opened. With food especially, so much more nuance and flavor. Even people's B.O. is compelling, just because I'm not used that level of detail and intricacy in odors.

It's tragic that I robbed myself of all this sensory stimulation for so many years. I think this aspect gets overlooked in lieu of the more serious health risks of smoking.

Can anyone relate?

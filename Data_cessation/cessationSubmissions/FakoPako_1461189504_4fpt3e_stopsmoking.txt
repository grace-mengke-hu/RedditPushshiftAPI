New Year quitters.. Where are you?

Thought I would drop in and say hello. It's been 110 days, according to my flare. I don't even count days anymore. Smoking seriously doesn't cross my mind at all. It's strange how insignificant it is for me now, but before it was like my life was going to end. Pffff...It's nothing.

I hope my New Year quitters peeps are still here and going strong. 

I picked up a new addiction...walking/running. OMG I can't get enough. My fitbit HR is my new addiction lol. I am running stairs at work every hour. Every hour that my former smoking buddy gets up to go outside for a smoke, I do 10-15 floors of stairs! It feels freaking great! 

Well, I thought I would drop in and see whats going on. Stick to it newbies. It's awesome! It feels really really really good! Hold tight in first week or two, then it's a freaking PIECE OF FUCKING CAKE! You got this shit!

Ok, time for my workout. C-ya!

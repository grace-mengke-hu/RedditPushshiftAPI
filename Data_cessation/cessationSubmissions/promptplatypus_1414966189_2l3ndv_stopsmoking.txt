Made it to two months.

My Smoke Free app counter just hit two months and I'm pretty stoked about it. I've spent a lot of time as a 'professional quitter', but I think I'm really done with it this time. I know it's really rough getting started, but it gets so much easier as the time goes by. Two months sounded like two years when I started the first twenty-four hours, but here I am. Good luck to those just starting out and I'll see you guys at 90 days!

I hit the reset button :( 1000% regret that one cigarette.

After six months strong with not a single puff, distressed and a big fight with a family member knocked me off my feet. And that one puff pulled me right back in. After a few weeks, it began to feel as it did.  Tired in the mornings, sluggish all day, constantly worried about next cigarette. Putting myself back through the turmoil is 1000% worse than fighting through that bad night. 

Stay strong everyone.

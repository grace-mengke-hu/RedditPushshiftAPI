I smoked a pack a day for six years. Tomorrow will be the six-year anniversary of smoking my last cigarette.

I still remember sitting in the backroom at work, reading through post after post on /r/stopsmoking the entire morning of July 1, 2012. I had only tried to quit once prior to that, but I gave up on giving up after about two weeks. 

But that day stuck. I was in the middle of a smoke break around noon, and I just... stopped. I threw half of a cigarette away, walked back inside, dropped the rest of my pack - along with my lighter - into a trashcan, and I never smoked again.

So if you’re on the fence today, I say you should go for it! What if you’re already a non-smoker and you just haven’t realized it yet?

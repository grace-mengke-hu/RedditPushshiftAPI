Looking for words of motivation

Its already been 3 weeks and 4 days! Days are starting to quickly become weeks. I don't even think about smoking as often anymore, but when the thought does pass, it hits hard. For several hours, sometimes. 

As for now, I feel confident and on top of the world. My lungs have finally stopped hacking up brown loogie. My relationship with my parents and sister has become stronger. My wallet has also been thanking me tremendously. Breath smells great, gums are pink again, teeth are finally turning whiter, etc, etc.

However, when stress builds up at home, I tend to start thinking about the future and get trapped in these "what ifs" scenarios in my head. After summer ends, and I'm back at school, will the stress lead me back to smoking? Or when I've graduated and have gotten more money, would I start up smoking again. My future feels uncertain especially since I'm only 22.

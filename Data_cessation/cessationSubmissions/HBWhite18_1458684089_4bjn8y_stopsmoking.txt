23 days and counting-things I do to help

Well, After almost 32 years of smoking I'm 23 days smoke free. (Tried once before, didn't take) So I found a few things to do that help me keep my mind off of it in the evenings. 1) Crochet. I only know the one stitch, so I have one, very long, one stitch piece of yarn. :) The one thing I really loved was rolling all our loose change. We had a bowl full! I sat down for several nights and rolled it all. Now not only am I saving over $250/month by not smoking I just rolled over $146.00 worth of change. That, to my husband, is found money so it has been put in the bank and a check written in that amount to the SPCA. Now, I'm all out of change-Anyone need coins rolled? :)

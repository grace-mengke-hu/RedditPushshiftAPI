14 Days - Update.

Well.

If you read my previous post on day seven, you'd know that up until that point everything had been relatively good except for me experiencing insomnia.

Unfortunately after day ten, it sort of took a turn for the worst. Ever since I was ten days in, each day becomes harder and harder. I am finding it so much more difficult now than I did before.

I'm holding out and I've been around smokers but managed to not cave, but the Carr mentality has wore off, and I'm left pretty depressed that I can't sleep, I have a sore throat and I'm coughing which are supposedly withdrawal symptoms, and I'm missing my cigs.

I've been speaking to my buddy who's gone about a year without a cigarette, and he tells me that he still craves cigarettes now and again, which sort of makes me scared that I'm going to be addicted for the rest of my life.

I guess I need some encouragement haha.

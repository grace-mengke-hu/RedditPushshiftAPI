Holy Shit. Read Allan Carr's book. It works. 

I had my first cigarette when I was like 12 or 13, became a pack a day smoker pretty much the day that I could legally buy them when I was 18 and smoked a pack a day for 3 and a half years. Tried to quit many times, always fell back on it. Then I quit smoking and read about Allan Carr's The Easy Way to Quit smoking so a couple days into quitting I read the book an it completely worked. It completely removes the desire to smoke using only pure logic and reason. Quitting smoking doesn't seem like this gargantuan task anymore. When you start to believe that quitting smoking is incredibly hard you are just shooting yourself in the foot. It becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. Sure physical withdrawal can be quite uncomfortable and when you're trying to will yourself away from smoking it can be incredibly hard because the temptation is everywhere and always present, but Carr's book really goes through the logic step by step and by the end I had no desire to smoke anymore. Now when I walk past other people that smoke I don't wanna strike up a conversation just to bum a cigarette or go to the nearest store to buy a pack. I just feel sorry for them. I haven't touched a cigarette in 48 days and I had actually not even thought about the fact that smoking used to run my life in over a week.

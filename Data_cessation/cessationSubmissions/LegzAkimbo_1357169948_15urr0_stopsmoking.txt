Don't allow yourself to come up with excuses

"I'm not ready"
"I'm too stressed" "there are a few big nights out coming up" "I don't really want to quit" "smoking's not that bad" "I don't need to quit yet" "Non-smokers are so boring" "I'll put on weight" "It's impacting my relationship" "It's making me be mean to my friends/family" "I can't concentrate on my work"

Try and take yourself back to how you felt just before you quit, not how difficult it is afterwards.

Don't let yourself get away with shitty excuses.

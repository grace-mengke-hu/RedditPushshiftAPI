Question for pot-smokers..

I smoke both.  I just finished reading Allen Carr's book.  I'm ready and just smoked my last.  I happen to be in Japan on vacation and return back to the States tomorrow, where I smoke a lot of herb.  How treacherous are the waters of pot-smoking whilst quitting?  Does anyone have any experiences or insights worth sharing?

By the way, I subscribed to this subreddit a few months back, and I probably wouldn't have committed to quitting today without it.  A big, hearty thanks!

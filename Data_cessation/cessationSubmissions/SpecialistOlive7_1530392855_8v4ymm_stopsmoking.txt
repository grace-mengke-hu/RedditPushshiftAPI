I feel like an idiot

I had quit for 5 years, no one smoke. I was recently extremely depressed following a break up of a 5 year relationship and someone offered me a cigarette at the right time and the memories came flooding back. I felt really good and it alleviated the depression a bit. Anyone have a similar story? I have only bought a few packs and today begins my run of quitting cold turkey. I know I can do it and my depression has passed. Hoping for some support my friends!

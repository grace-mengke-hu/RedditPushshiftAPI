Hey fellow quitters. I'm new to this sub. I'm in my first week and just had one or two questions for people who have quit

I was smoking 1-1.5 packs of Newport daily.  I had a very stressful year (lost my mother, father had a stroke and almost died.) and it caused me to even smoke 2 packs a day sometimes. Anyway, I'm on day 4 (my flair says three but only because I accidentally entered the wrong date when I submitted it.) and my lungs feel better, but I've had cold like symptoms all week (soreness, achy, shaky, etc).  While my energy level has gone WAY up, and my mind seems to be sharper, physically I'm feeling kind of crappy.  Is this something anyone else has experienced?  

My other question is how long did others wait to start exercising?  I literally run out of breath walking up one flight of steps.  That's been better this week, but I want to start at least doing some basic cardio.  Is this something I should ask a doctor instead?

Thanks everyone!  BTW this sub is really awesome.  Just reading through some of the threads, there's little to no douchery in here and everyone really seems to support one another.  I like it.

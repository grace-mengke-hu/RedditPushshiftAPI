18 days... With ChampixÂ®. What about after treatment?

Hi folks, 

I always promised myself that I will stop smoking the day I'll have a kid. I started cigarette at 11 or 12yo, for a summer, then really start smoking at 14. Things got more serious at 15 when weed and beers joined the game. 

Here I am, 32, and a little one will show up next month! 

So it's been 18 days today I stopped smoking, by following Champix treatment since 28 days. So far, it's pretty easy; no craving (or just very small ones that go away very fast) , relax about it... It even leads me to drink much less! As cigarette is the best friend of drinks, I feel like I limit myself on drinks to not have the craving issue. Good 2 in 1!
My body accept pretty well the treatment, got only few weird dreams. 

For the ones who stopped with Champix, I have a question : how did it go for you at the end of treatment, after 3 months? I afraid of getting cravings and start smoking again... 

Thanks for your answers!

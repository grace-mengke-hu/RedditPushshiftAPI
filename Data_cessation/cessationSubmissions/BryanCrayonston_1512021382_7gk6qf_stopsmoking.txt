Running after quitting

Has anyone here taken up running after quitting? I'm at somewhere around 150 days and convinced myself that if I have the will power to quit one incredibly nasty habit, I have the will power to pick up some good ones, right?

So tonight I went for a run for the first time in a long time. I made it further than I thought I would. Certainly further than it would if I still smoked. But holy shit did my lungs hurt. I had to stop and walk for a bit it got so bad. I'm gonna go again tomorrow and try to keep pushing, try to go further and walk less. But I need to know... does it get better? I smoked for about 12 years - will my lungs eventually begin to hurt less with more exercise (like other body parts), or are they just permanently fucked?

Was stopping smoking unexpectedly easy for anyone else?

Y'all will probably hate me for it. After 7 years of smoking half a pack a day and 1.5 a day in the weekend, I quit cold turkey. The first two weeks I was kinda irritated all the time but after that I could go to clubs where people smoked and already kinda forgot what it was like - didn't consider myself a smoker anymore. I missed the feeling of it a little but almost no urges. I was done with it and still am. Of all my addictions I thought this was the hardest one to quit, I kept postponing it - and it's apparently easier to quit than my other vices! Anyone else had this experience?

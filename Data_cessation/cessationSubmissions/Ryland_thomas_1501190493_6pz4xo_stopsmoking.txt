6/7 months smoke free today i failed

I often get urges i think about smoking everyday and it only got harder for me after the 3 month point , but i persevered . Today i had a pretty mentally straining day at work ! And broke my cycle ! 

I hate myself so much all that effort of not giving in to urges and today i just couldnt fight them anymore !

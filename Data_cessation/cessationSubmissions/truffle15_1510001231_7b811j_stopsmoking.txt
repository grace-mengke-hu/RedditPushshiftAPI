Day two.

So I stopped smoking a couple of years back using Easyway and managed to stop for 8 months then due to a bereavement started again, so I know I am more than capable of doing this. 

I'm quitting again with my husband now. I didn't smoke yesterday as I was pretty hungover, but today was my first day at work. I usually have two before work, one mid morning, two or three over lunch, one mid afternoon, one at the end of the day and then a few in the evening at home.

I've been so miserable - I feel like I'm not a nice person when I don't smoke! I'm blunt with people, just short of being rude. I've made my colleagues aware I'm quitting so they know I'm not purposefully being difficult. I'm also due on my period this week so great timing there. 

I've been here before so I know that by Friday, Saturday, I'll be pretty much there and I just need to get past these first few days. I really want to light up (we don't have any in the house luckily!) and I'm worried about social situations as I love having a smoke while drinking, in a pub garden etc. 

BUT I don't want to smell like an ash tray anymore. I want to be able to breathe walking up the stairs and to the bus. I have more energy when I don't smoke, my skin is clearer. I don't want to be smoking money that could go to better use. 

I'll check in on Friday with an update!

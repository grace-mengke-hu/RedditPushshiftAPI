I want to stop smoking. Rant inside.

I want to stop smoking. At least that's what I tell myself, and I tell myself this quite often. But when it all boils down, I want to smoking on my commute to work, during my break, after meals, and when I'm bored. At least that's what I tell myself. I can't tell if that's nicotine telling my brain that or just the habit. My dad, who quit successfully about five years ago, always tells me you have to really want to quit to actually quit. It places this very confusing stigma on me and I don't know what's true. I hope this is making some sense.

About a year ago my girlfriend and I got into a really big argument and she confessed to me that she was finding difficult to be attracted to me because of the smoking. I vowed to quit then, but then I just quit smoking around her. Now I smoke when I'm with her and it makes me feel this huge guilt. She has a four year old son and this past Sunday they were drawing a volcano with chalk in the driveway and he was drawing smoke. Somehow the conversation went from that to Uncle Trey smokes, Papa smokes, Matthew smokes too. Matthew needs to cut that out. And I want to. Or least I think I do.

This is really long winded, but it's helping to get it all out. What should I do? Just fucking quit already? Am I motivated enough? I don't know. I'm seeking that and guidance. I have half a pack of Camel Lights downstairs and I know as soon as I get on the interstate tomorrow I'll want one. Do I finish out the pack? Fuck it, leave them at home? Throw them away? I've thrown so many packs away to come home and even get them out of the trash. God damn. I wish this were easy.

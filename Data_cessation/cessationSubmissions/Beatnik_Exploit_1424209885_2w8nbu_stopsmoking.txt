Cold Turkey sounds better for dinner

So today is day 1, honestly never knew this subreddit even existed but was thinking about smoking so I decided why not and say hello. 

Not my first time quitting but I am so tired of smelling like a dam ash tray I am fed up with my self. 

So cold turkey, why does this not feel like the gold standard in quitting, every time I tell someone I just want to quit cold turkey I am told to try a pill, patch or technique. 

I my self have tried the patch with little success but cold turkey and Wellbutrin have given me a few months of freedom before I slip back into smoking again. The most I have gone is maybe 6 months but that was cold turkey. Wellbutrin was interesting because I don't really remember the withdrawals but I do remember feeling out of it

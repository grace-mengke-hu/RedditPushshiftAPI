16 days in.

May 15th was the last time I smoked. I went out for drinks the other night and although was sorely tempted I resisted the urge. What really helps me is the fact I drive a taxi and people that smoke get in my car and they really really smell! I cannot stand the smell and never ever want to smell like that again.

Almost a month smoke-free, but brain fog making work impossible, concerned about job.

After wanting to quit for a long time, I finally did 25 days ago. I've gone through a range of withdrawal symptoms -- anger, depression, upset stomach etc etc. But the one I can't shake, and which affects me earning a livelihood, is the brain fog I've experienced with no reprieve over the past four weeks.

I am a journalist, and always smoked when I was writing. Since quitting, I have been late completing assignments and unable to organize my thoughts. I'm fearful that I will lose my job. I spend 30 minutes on an email because I feel it could be missing words or not flow correctly. 

I'm past the point where I physically want a cigarette. My only urge is to be able to concentrate, which I at least associate with cigarettes. It's obviously in part psychological, but I do think the nicotine served to medicate my attention difficulties to a degree.

If this brain fog continues I may have to revert to e-cigarettes. 

Anyone else have brain-fog last months?

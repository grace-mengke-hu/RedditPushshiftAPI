The smoker's flu is becoming worse by the day. But I am happy that I quit a week ago!

I relapsed and quit again, and now I have the smoker's flu, again. I don't like having much less energy than normally and not being able to exercise as intensily as I'd like as a result (but hell I won't skip training!), but I am actually happy that's it's there. Smoking is very bad for our health, not just on the long term (ugly diseases), but also on the short term (much worse endurance, coughing, etc). This smoker's flu is just a symptom of my body cleaning up itself. And I will interpret it as a reminder that I should not poison myself again.

No more smoking. Yeah, it's april 1, but I couldn't be more serious about this! ;p

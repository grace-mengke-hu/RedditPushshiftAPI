32 days in and problems with panic/anxiety

Nicotine withdrawal seems to have messed with my brain pretty badly. Has anyone else experienced a big increase in moments of anxiety and panic after quitting smoking? How long did it last for? Sometimes it gets to the point where I can't even work properly, and I always have difficulty falling asleep now.

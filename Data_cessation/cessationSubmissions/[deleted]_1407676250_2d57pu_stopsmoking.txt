Is it wise to add quitting to an already stressful time in my personal life?

Like the title says, I have some ongoing stressful stuff in my personal life. Relationships, other aspects of self improvement, and pushing personal boundaries. 

I was a smoker several years ago, mid teens to early twenties. I completely quit for about 7 or 8 years. But ended up picking it up again dealing with some heartbreak, using it as a minor act of rebellion, and as an escape from a job I was overworked and stressed in.

Damn that was a long week

Day 7 today. Pretty sure my family and friends don't think so highly of me after this week but i actually made it. Cravings are definitely tapering off and I kinda feel normal again. I will never put myself or he people around me through this again. Nice to know I have a lot more willpower than I give myself credit for.

3rd day - still hanging in there

Actually I snuck 3 cigarettes ( in a row) after my first day because of cravings. I immediately broke out in my face and scalp with an oily burning sensation which I knew would be bad the next day, and it was. So, I have no desire to smoke anymore. Also my breathe is short and my throat is constantly burning. Is less today, but still there. I am really happy not to be poisoning my body today. Make no mistake - it is pure poisoning. I smoked for more than 34 years, and every day was "Quit tomorrow". Tomorrow never comes - it's always a day away. Please don't make the same mistake I did - quit now!

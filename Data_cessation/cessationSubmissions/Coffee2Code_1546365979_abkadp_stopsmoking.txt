GF gets pissed off because I quit

I quit today and apparently I'm once again "the terrible mean killing machine / nuclear device" even though I'm attempting my hardest to stay calm and nice, as for the most time I am. 

But she tries her hardest to get me to fly off the handle and run for my cigarettes. 

She keeps telling me to start smoking again as well.

What the fuck, guys

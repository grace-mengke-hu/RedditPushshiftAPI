Kill two vices with one stone?!

Backstory: I have been on/off smoker from 14-23. Two kids helped me immensely forcing me to quit during pregnancy. Yet, I always seemed to slowly get back into it. 

25 days ago I decided that my drinking habit, of smoking cigarettes was turning into an everyday habit, again, and I was beginning to smoke a lot. I quit smoking. Cold turkey. I vow to never smell disgusting again, never to have a cigarette hangover again. I FEEL AMAZING. 

I also started chewing regularly at 18. I have never been successful in quitting more than probably 3 days. But I HATE that I do it. I am a lady, like a classy lady, who hides cans of chews in her purse, and will not buy it at any local stores, because I am that embarrassed that I chew. But I just am so hooked. 

Anyways, I am trying to live without vices, and be healthier for myself and my sweet babies. Has anyone here concurrently quit two addictions? Do you recommend I start with patches/gum, or just go cold turkey, on will power alone? How long should I wait between quitting each? I can get free patches/gum with a quit program in my state.

Nearly two weeks without having a smoke

Just wanted to post about what helped me quit. I'm a huge comedy fan and listen to a lot of comedy podcast. Recently I've been getting into the podcast "This past weekend" with Theo Von and he's the one that gave me the courage and will to quit. Not only am I entertained because he's hilarious but I get inspired to live a healthier life both mentally and physically. Theo Von is 2 years sober, he used to have a bad cocaine habit. If he can do it and still have a great life while making people laugh so can we.

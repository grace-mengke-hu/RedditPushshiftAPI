Smoking is deadly...

But my addict brain is trying to convince me that not smoking is going to kill me. It's been almost 24 hours. I'm almost convinced I just can't handle these withdrawals. Somebody please remind me why I should quit smoking? Seriously. 

Edit: thanks I don't feel like I'm dying anymore. Well, for now. I think i can do it, though. Silly mind can trick you into anything.

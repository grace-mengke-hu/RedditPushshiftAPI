Need advice for nicotine replacement

Hi Guys,

Not had much luck with my search on this, but figured reddit might be the place to find the information. I quit myself a few years ago, but my fiance is trying at the moment.

She has a major problem though and that's being allergic to most forms of NRT. She has a lot of allergies and most forms of it seem to contain at least one of her problem substances!

Patches - Bring her up in a massive rash almost straight away.

Gum/Lozenges - Really allergic to artificial sweeteners, anything marketed as "sugar free" makes her ill if she takes it, primarily aspartame and acesulfame k are the worst offenders. I did find one particular flavour of gum (fruitfusion) that didnt have sweeteners and used actual sugar but when we've looked in stores now its changed and also uses sweeteners!

Vaping - She got on really well with this before, started using it in place of smoking and didn't have a cigarette for about a month, then started getting allergy symptoms again once her body decided it was foreign and didn't like it! We tried different liquids, different brands, replacing the vape kit completely. Also tried 100% VG liquids.

Has anyone had any similar problems or if possible know where to find some sweetener free NRT? (Or patches that are designed for super sensitive skin) She's desperate to quit and its heart breaking seeing her try so hard and having her own body reject all these different types of treatments.

Our last option was getting a prescription for Champix/Zyban from the NHS, but that is really the last option if there are alternatives!

Thanks,

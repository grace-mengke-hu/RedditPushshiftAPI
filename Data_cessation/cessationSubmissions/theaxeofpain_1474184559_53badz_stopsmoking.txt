Approaching the first 24 hours

I've been smoking for a little less than 10 years, about a pack a day, and this is my first ever attempt at quitting. So far it hasn't been hard, I don't think I have withdrawal symptoms. I actually had a drag this morning, and even though it felt good, I immediately put it out, it just didn't feel right and worth it. 

I really want to gain some weight (I'm very thin, a bit less than 60 kg, 175 cm tall) and quitting, exercising and eating a bit more and healthier might help. 

Yesterday was drinking a few beers but resisted the temptation, so I think that's a good start. 

Edit: I found that apps like Smoke Free and Cessation Nation are really helpful, with achievements, missions and stuff like that, kind of like behavioral therapy.

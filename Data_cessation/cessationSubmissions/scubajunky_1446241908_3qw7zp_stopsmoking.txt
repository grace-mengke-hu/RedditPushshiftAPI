Found out I had a benign lesion on my tongue today. Let's try this again. Day 1 starts now.

Freaked out about this lump I noticed on my tongue all week. Turns out it was benign. I smoked all week, and now I'm quitting for good. 

I feel sad that I'm losing cigarettes. I've used them for nearly 10 years. I'm probably more emotionally attached to them than I am physically. 

It's time, though. It's just not worth it anymore. 

Wish me luck. Thanks for being a part of this subreddit. I intend on coming here every time I want a cig.

One Day at a Time

Sometimes I feel amazing. Sometimes I feel totally on edge. I feel grateful as I near the completion of my 10th day. I am proud of myself! I am looking forward to tomorrow and each day to follow. I could not honestly say that when I smoked half a pack a day. I was stressed out, tired, and miserable. I thought the cigarettes helped me cope with my stress. I am stunned by how much stress has disappeared from my life by completely eliminating smoking. I am also terrified by the thought that I could lose my self-control at any point and smoke again. It makes me sick to know that I'm psychologically scarred like this for who knows how long. That I did it to myself, in denial, is even more disturbing. I will just remind myself to take things one day at a time.

On day 4. Again.

I'm quitting again.  Go me.  Been smoking  about twenty years and have tried to quit so many times before.  I realized something different this time though. In the past, I was always quitting....,*for now *,  or until later when I could have one here and there.  Like somehow quitting was a temporary thing I was  *trying * to do. This time, I had to take Yoda's advice and just do it  (there is no try, do or do not) and do it my way. 

 I didn't rush it, I didn't use a single method to quit , I sort of mixed and matched what parts have worked for me in the past (Chantix, meditation,  journal daily,  support from those close to me, candy /gun) .  I feel so much more confident this time, and eager to succeed.  That part is super new, I'm excited to quit and it doesn't feel like a punishment this time. This time, it feels like a challenge, but one in ready to face. 

Thanks for reading and good luck to all of you!!

The big 5-0!!!

Made it to 50 without too much pain....Alan Carrs book really helped, and except for the minor weight gain, I'm feeling IN CONTROL and can confidently say that I'm a non smoker!!!!!  After a lousy first week, and subsequently easier following weeks, I'm feeling good.....I smoked for 17 years (yes, I know, I'm old as shit) and never in my past history of quitting, was I EVER this confident that I could stay quit as I am this time! The flair is a great motivator, and I'm going to do something damn special when I hit that 100 day star, so for everyone out there, KNOW that we can all be NONSMOKERS if we just try! :)

At Home for 3 days Project

I posted this link a couple of days ago:  http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/2ou8j8/anyone_ever_try_not_leaving_house_to_quit_smoking/

All my shopping is done.  Got 4 packs of gum, and just smoked my last cig for a very long time hopefully.  Thanks for all the support.

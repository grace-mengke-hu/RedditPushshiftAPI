Stopped smoking on 2013-09-22! Not easy at all.

Doing this post as more of a way to let off some steam as everyone I've talked to about this has only made jokes about it. 

I started smoking when I was 15.... 10 years ago - out of pure peer pressure. I was a stupid teenager, I know. I smoked on average 1 pack a day and I've tried quitting once before and managed to go 13days before giving in after having a few beers.

Three months ago I made it a goal and commitment to myself that on the weekend of September 20th I would quit smoking for good. Yesterday I didn't have one cigaratte and things were fine. Today on the other hand has been exponencially harder. Everything started falling apart very early as I lost my car keys, had to take the bus on a rainy day and have just been losing my cool for any little reason.

I guess what I'm trying to say is I'd just really apreaciate any kind of encouragement or advice as it's been a shit day.

Day 2 - 14mg patch

Feel lethargic and like I want to be sick from the amount of cookies I ate last night......but, I am on day 2 and really, the fact that I didn't have a cigarette is all that matters really.  My husband is still smoking.  I want this to be the last time I have to go through this shit.

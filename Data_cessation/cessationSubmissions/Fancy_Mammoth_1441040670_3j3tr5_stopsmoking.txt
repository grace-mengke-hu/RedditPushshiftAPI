Today is day 10

So I have been using the patch for about 10 days now. Until I quit I was smoking between a pack and a pack and a half a day. I have slowly weened myself off cigarettes and yesterday managed to go the entire day without a patch - through alot of stressful events - and did not feel the need for a cigarette. I plan to continue using the patch for a few more weeks until i feel the need completely disappear. I'm starting to feel better, almost like I've gotten a massive quality of life improvement . I am 22 and have been smoking since i was 18. I quit once for 9 months after having surgery and picked it up again after starting a new job with people who smoked. I'm turning over a new leaf, and this time, its not a tobacco leaf. If anyone has any additional tips and tricks to help take the edge off it would be greatly appreciated. Anyway here is to a new smoke free beginning.

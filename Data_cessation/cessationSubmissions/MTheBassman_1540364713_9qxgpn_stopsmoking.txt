Need some tips on relieving withdrawal symptoms

Hey everyone,

First of all, I quit smoking about 5 days ago. Before that I was quite a regular smoker and smoked about 4 packs a week, though it was not uncommon for me to get through a whole pack while going out. Now I quit cold turkey but the detox symptoms are very strong for me. First I got a nasty cold with intense sneezing and painful coughing. Now I just have the cough that appears occasionally.

I also noticed I sleep for short nights and generally get very intense dreams that just make me exhausted when I wake up. A lack of concentration and mild anxiety also have been appearing here and there.

So my question is: is there any way to relieve these symptoms or do I just have to battle through it and get the poison out?

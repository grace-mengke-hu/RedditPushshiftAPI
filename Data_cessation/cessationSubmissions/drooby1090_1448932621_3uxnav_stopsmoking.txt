Smoked for 15 years

Always told myself that I'd quit before I was 21,  then I'd quit before I finished college, then it was before I turned 30.   Since all of those didn't happen, I'm actually trying now for the first time since I was 16.   8 days in, feelin okay.   Im using an ecig to help avoid the need to begin punching people.   I know it's not ideal, but it's helpful.   Also the kwit app gives me some positive feedback.

Day two. Doing all the things.

Quit two days ago â€“ cold turkey. I can honestly say that day one was the slowest day in my life ever. The hours went by so, so slowly...

Day two. I've cleaned the toilet, all apartment surfaces, and rearranged the cupboards. I'm doing all the things to keep my mind, mouth and hands busy. Kind of like a frantic Mrs. Doubtfire. I'd say it's working rather well: a tip for all quitters out there!

Wish me luck.

I tried nicotine salts to help me quit smoking

I've been smoking cigarettes since I was a lad, but I want to quit. I do not find it appealing, but I am addicted to the nicotine now. I've tried everything - therapy, hypnosis, the patch..everything. A few years ago I started smoking e-cigarettes thinking it would trick my body into quitting regular cigarettes. But all it did was make me want to smoke even more when I was indoors. I thought about giving vaping another chance, but my fear was I would waste money on flavored e-liquid for naught. A pal of mine went to a vape show earlier this year in Birmingham, UK and found a new brand of e-liquid like no other. It was something called nicotine salts. Of course, I didn't buy any at first because who's to say it would have any effect on me. My friend, however, was brave enough to spend his money on the product. I've had a hit here and there but he has been consistent. It seems he prefers it over his cigarettes now. I'm thinking about giving it a go; what do you think? Let me hear your opinions.

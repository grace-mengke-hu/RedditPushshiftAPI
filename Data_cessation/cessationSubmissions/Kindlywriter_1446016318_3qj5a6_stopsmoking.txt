Well guys, thanks again for the support. It helped heaps. I am still holding strong, it's day four. Not doing too great.

Things that have happened to me since I quit smoking four days ago:

-I've cried A LOT
-I've lashed out at my well meaning boyfriend
-I've missed work
-I've dranken to excess
-I've been utterly depressed

Bad tally right? Then I thought about this.

Things that have happened to me while smoking:

-I've cried A LOT
-I've lashed out at my well meaning boyfriend
-I've missed work
-I've dranken to excess
-I've been utterly depressed
-I've been wheezy/out of breath/stressed to death where my next fix was coming, and I smelled like shit when that all was happening

This thought helped me a bit. Thanks again guys, I BELIEVE that one day this will be a non-issue.

Ps it's the fricken fourth day. I still physically crave a cigarette as much as on the first day. Don't they say three days????

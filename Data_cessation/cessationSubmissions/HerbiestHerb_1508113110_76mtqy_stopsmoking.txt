Im making yet another attempt to quit smoking.

I quit for a few months during the end of summer up until early fall. I started letting myself have one here and there. Excusing myself because, “hey, at least I’m not buying them.” In the past 2 weeks I’ve probably bought 5-6 packs of cigarettes and smoked more than I did before I quit last. Nature of the beast I guess. I am ready once again. I know it can be done because I have done it before. I just have to exercise better self discipline and hold myself accountable. I can do this.

Need a little encouragement

I'm almost 48 and smoked a pack and a half a day most of that time.  Quit for 3 years using chantix until my divorce 6 years ago.

I've been using chantix again.   Today is 6 days 9 hours smoke free.  Had a slip today and smoked a couple of cancer sticks.  Feel crappy about it.  Not looking forward to telling my fiancee.  I know she'll understand but disappointed.  I'd been promising for 2 years I'd quit.

I think I let myself think it was too easy.  And I feel guilty seeing the amount of time I've "not smoked" on my app after slipping today. 

How do you guys deal with these feelings?

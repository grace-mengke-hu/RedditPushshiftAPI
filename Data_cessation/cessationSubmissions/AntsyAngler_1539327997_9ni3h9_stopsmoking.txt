4+ months quit, after 20 years smoking. Could this feeling of anxiety, stress, and low grade panic still be related to quitting after 4 months?

I am trying to determine if I'm still experiencing feelings of unease from quitting smoking after 4 months of no nicotine.  It's true that there are some other stressful factors in my life, but the feeling of unease and anxiety seem heightened.  Do any of you long term quitters have thoughts about the time it felt to get over general anxiety from smoking?

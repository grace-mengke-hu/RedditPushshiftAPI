Quitters flu

Hello ex smokers, I quit smoking since February (vaped a bit after) but put that down as well. Now I have the worse sore throat that feels like its getting worse and won't go away. I have odd body aches and anxiety to the max. Q: after quitting did anyone get sick or have a sore throat after quitting or swollen lympnodes? When I goto the hospital all of the results come back negative and they say im fine but I fell like sht.

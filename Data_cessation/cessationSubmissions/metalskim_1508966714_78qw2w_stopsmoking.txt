Stress/lifestyle induced pains?

So I'm day 38, constantly stressed and anxious. Im feeling sore on my left lower back, stomach aches and some discomfort in my left testes. I've been working out and weight training too. 

Is there anything i could possibly be doing wrong like say stressing so much it's causing physical problems or that I could be over exerting myself to cause these? I've cut out caffiene, nicotine and soda for this long too. It just feels like I should start to feel better not worse this far in

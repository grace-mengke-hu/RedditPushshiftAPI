Please tell me not to ruin my quit &amp; why.

Omg my entire life sucks right now and I've been quit for 11 days and I'm about ready to throw in the towel, but I know some part of me will really regret it. I'm feeling so weak though. Please help. Idk what to do. I'm so stressed, upset, very very alone....idk.

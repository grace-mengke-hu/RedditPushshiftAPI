Breaking point

25 years old and been smoking for 3 years and it has got to stop!!! I'm tired of scrambling for money to buy cigs. Missing out on 15 minutes of pay at work to leave and get a smoke in (workplace went smoke free January 1st) but today I think was the last straw.  As odd as it may sound.  I smoke in my car and had the back window cracked so after I finished my cigarette and tossed it like normal (I'm bad I know) I get home and discover the butt came back into my car through the window and burnt a hole in my seat!  It's a relatively newish car (2009) and I have always felt bad for smoking in it but this is the last straw.  I'm pissed at myself for letting this happen.   I'm finishing this pack and I'm done! Enough is enough

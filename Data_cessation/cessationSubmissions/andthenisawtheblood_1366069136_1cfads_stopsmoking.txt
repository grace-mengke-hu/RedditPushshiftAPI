Starting over--THIS TIME with Swisher Sweets!

Jointed reddit for this subreddit, so just wanted to put my story out here:

I hadn't started smoking until I joined the Marine Corps (joined at 22, started smoking at 23), and just got addicted from there. Didn't really have a reason to quit until I met my girlfriend, who is an ex-smoker (for over 4 years). Tried and tried cold turkey, and went on the patch which helped a lot. I had quit in November and was good up until early March, when my brother relapsed with heroin use, and I smoked for a few days. I didn't really feel like I became "re-addicted" though.

At that point my girlfriend and I went on vacation to see her brother, who has kids, so I didn't smoke a thing for 10 days, which should've been a great clean slate, but when I got back I started smoking Swisher Sweet cigarillo. 1 a day became 3 a day became 5 a day. As awful as it sounds, it's easier to hide from my girlfriend (we live together and I'm going to school full time at the moment) than smoking. We're talking about saving up for a house, and the money I could save along with the obvious health benefits and the crappy way it makes me feel makes me want to quit. With the SS I don't feel like I have a physical addiction though, so I feel like real willpower is what I need. 

Thanks in advance for the support.

Depression and Smoking

So i'm a pretty depressed person, started when I was 14 (17 now) which is also when i started smoking as a way to feel better. I feel like smoking is both worsening and making it better, So on edge right now, i feel good after i smoke but shitty straight after (not like hours) but like 2-3 Minutes. Is this just me or a part of smoking? Sorry if this is a stupid question, im just a confused teenager after all haha

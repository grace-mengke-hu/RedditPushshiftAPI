93 days... WTF?

The past week I've been craving like nobody's business... I don't want one. The thought of having one is repulsive, but damn it keeps hitting me in waves. This is a recent development - This wasn't happening two weeks ago. Weird.

EDIT: To be clear, I haven't smoked, not am I going too. It's just weird to me that is gotten over the cravings and they've started up again. 

Thanks for the support everyone. I hadn't heard of the three month thing before. I didn't have it the last time I quit (lasted two years).

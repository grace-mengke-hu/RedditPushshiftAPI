Chest tightness and night shift problems...

Sorry for the 2 questions in one post. I quit 4 months ago and I sometimes get a real tight feeling in my chest like someone is squeezing me and I have to fight to breathe. Is this normal?

Also I work night shift and I never had problems staying awake till now. I used to just smoke a bunch of cigarettes at 4AM to stay awake but now I can't. Any suggestions?

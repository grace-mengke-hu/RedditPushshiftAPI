How do you guys deal with the mood swings?

The last time I quit I found out there was a chance I was pregnant and stopped with almost no problems. This time around I'm a little irratated the first day with no nicotine, the second day I'm ready to fight anyone and anything, the third I don't even want to get out of bed, and I haven't even made it to the fourth day yet because I always give up. How long does the moodiness last? What did you guys do to make the first days tolerable?

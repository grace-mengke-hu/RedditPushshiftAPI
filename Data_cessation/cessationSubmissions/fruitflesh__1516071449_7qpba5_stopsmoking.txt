I want to help my mom quit smoking

My mom has been a pretty heavy smoker for over 30 years. Since the recent death of her mother (my grandmother) she is planning to finally quit on my grandmothers birthday in February.

The thing is, I know there are lots of apps and tech type stuff that can help, she doesn't have a smart phone and doesn't really handle technology that well in general. I'd appreciate some advice on how to help her cope with stopping something she's been doing for so long.

End of day 2 and i'm struggling

I have reached the end of day 2 cold turkey and I am really struggling. I want a smoke SO BAD! I can't get the thought out of my mind. I am currently on holiday at my parents house in the beautiful place of Queenstown New Zealand, it is here I decided to quit. Tomorrow I fly home to Auckland to go back to work, I am afraid I won't be able to handle the stress of my job and the busy city. Please /r/stopsmoking what are some tips/thought processes I can use to stop the urge? 

I really appreciate advice you may have.

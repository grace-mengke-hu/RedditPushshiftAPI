How did you quit smoking? Did you replace your cravings with anything?

I had decided in May that I was gonna quit on the 1st of September, after the Summer and all.

I’m 26 and the longest I’ve gone without smoking was a month. I feel ready and confident, though.

On the 31st of August, I sat outside before going to bed with a brand new pack. I chainsmoked as many as I could and when I began the 5th smoke, I naturally told myself this was the last time. 

It felt like a break up that went well.

I get cravings and I surprise myself that I actually log them into the Smoke-Free app. Food naturally comes to mind as a replacement but I don’t want to gain weight from smoking so I drink water instead. It’s good but I need something a bit more rewarding.

What are you guys doing to get over cravings?

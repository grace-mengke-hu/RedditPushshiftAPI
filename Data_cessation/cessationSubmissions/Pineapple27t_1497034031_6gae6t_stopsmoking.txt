Started smoking again

So I just started smoking again after 1 year free from addiction, I only smoke 1/2 cigarettes in the afternoon to help me. 

I'm trying to quit weed (daily user for 3 years) and I think it's helping me get through the day since I only smoke weed at night

Anyone been through the same? How will it be to quit smoking again? 

I don't really enjoy it, the smell and taste is kinda bad

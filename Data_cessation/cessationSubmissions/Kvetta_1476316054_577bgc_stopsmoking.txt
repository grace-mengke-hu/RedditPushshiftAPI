This is harder than I thought

I'm going on day 2 of no cigarettes. I don't even have a pack to fall back on if I wanted to. If I did have that pack of cigarettes, you bet your ass I'd be sneaking one. I was at the store today and I didn't buy a pack. I thought about it. I thought about it real hard. The amount of people who have told me they're proud of me stopped me. I wouldn't want to tell them that I've failed, but it's not for them. This is for me. I just hope I can make it through. 

This is my second time trying to quit, but this time I'm doing it for myself and not for someone else. Maybe this time I'll get it right.

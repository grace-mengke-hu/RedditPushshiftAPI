Coughed up black mucus..time to quit

Hey guys, I've been coughing like crazy the last day or two because i have a cold, but just this morning i coughed up some black mucus..this kind of gave me a kick in the ass to ditch this habit. 

Does anyone know what black mucus indicates? should i be booking a doctors appointment or just give it time and see how it goes?

I'm 20 and have been a pack a day for about 6-7 months, before that I was only a social smoker having between 1-15 a week.

Really hope i can kick this, anyone have some tips? I'll be using my ecig for a while but I want to eventually stop smoking anything completely.

First time posting

Hello all! I am new to reddit and now to this subreddit. I am still awaiting my badge at the time of this posting, but today marks 3 weeks since my quit date. I attempted to quit last summer and successfully went 2 months, but had a relapse and took another year and a half to try again. But this time feels like the real deal. 

I joined a research study where they give me the patch and pay me to abstain (I blow into this machine that measures my carcinogen levels). But in truth I stopped using the patch because it seemed like it was only postponing having to deal with ceasing the use of nicotine. I'm still doing the study and I just tell them I'm using the patch because they pay me well lol. Think of it like this: I am getting an incentive to keep up with it for the first 2 months of quitting AND I get to speak to a professional on a weekly basis about how the quitting is going and they give me advice and handouts with a bunch of useful exercises and whatnot.

The key to quitting smoking or anything else for that matter is behavioral modification. But you can only change if you want to. I want to so I am on the beginning of not only getting rid of a nasty habit, but beginning many good ones. For me quitting is not just about stopping that one part of my life, but - over time - completely reshaping my life and my well-being.

Can I ask that this community will be there for me on my journey?

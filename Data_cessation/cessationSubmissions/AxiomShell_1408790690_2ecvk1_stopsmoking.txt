Starting today

Too many years smoking and I've had enough.
I've reached that point (very familiar to many of you, I'm sure) where I don't even get *any* pleasure at all from smoking. Just a sense of something I "have" to do regardless of how crap if feels. I don't have a big problem from not smoking during the day, my major relapse cause as always been "social" smoking. Going out, couple of drinks ... you know how it goes...

Could be the time

I finished my pack yesterday, usually would have already had a new pack opened and ready for when that one was up. But I’ve had a chest cold for over a week now that won’t let up and I just want to breathe again. 
Figured maybe it finally is the time. I’ve been talking about quitting for years (smoked for eight, started when I was thirteen and about a pack a day.) it’s been “by the time I’m 18.” “Before I graduate” “with the new year” “for my 21st” but I never followed through. Friends and family have been trying to convince me for years,  and I’ve just shrugged them off, and ignored their criticisms over my failed attempts over the years. 

I didn’t tell anyone that I was gonna quit this time, I am hoping not having their expectations will make it easier somehow? Idk. Anyway this is rambling and I’m feeling self conscious about my first written post. BUT, I woke up and made myself a breakfast this morning and drove my sister to school without a smoke for the first time in years!

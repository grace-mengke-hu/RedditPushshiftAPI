Burn the money you save...literally

A thought just occurred. If you are new to this and having trouble still after a few days, take the money you saved so far not smoking, out it in a bowl or your old ash tray and light it on fire. Literally. Watch your hard earned money burn. This might help your brain understand what smoking is really doing. No one wants to see their money go up in smoke right? 
It's an extreme move but some of us need that. 

OR you could just send it to me and I'll spend it recklessly on useless things then send you the pics of what I bought.;-)

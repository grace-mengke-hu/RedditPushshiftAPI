Gotta start somewhere

This is it. Day 1. I've attempted quitting before, between stress and the social aspect of it, I've started up again. I think I'm finally ready.

I've got some great support, which should help, but I'm already dealing with cravings. I feel like it's because i told myself no more. 

I'm glad to have found this community, and hope to check in often.

Wish me luck!

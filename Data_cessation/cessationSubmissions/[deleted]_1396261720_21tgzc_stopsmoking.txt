Third day :)

Going ok, I can hear something in my brain telling me to run down to the shops RIGHT NOW and get a pack, just ignoring it at the moment. Its not as hard when you seperate yourself from that feeling, although I've failed at quitting like 10 times now so who's to say I won't again :S

If I make it to two months I'm gonna buy a laptop with the money I save.

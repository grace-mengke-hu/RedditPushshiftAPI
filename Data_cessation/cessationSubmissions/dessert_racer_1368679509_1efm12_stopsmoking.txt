I'm thoroughly disgusted by cigarettes at this point...

Not sure if it is a psychological sort of defense mechanism, or if I really find them as gross as so many people seem too. 

Do the rest of you long term quitters feel the same, or do you still have positive associations with ciggies?

I can't even walk 10 feet behind someone smoking one now.  

Damn it feels good to be a gangster...

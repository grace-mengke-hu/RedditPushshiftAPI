Serial quitter

So finally decided to post after lurking for a while. Quit smoking yesterday and by 11 today, I had succumbed to the craving, after resisting the cravings associated with my morning routine. My longest time without smoking is about forty days and it started in a similar way before I went a full day without one. Am dreading the withdrawal symptoms already but I know they'll pass and with the number of people trying to quit too I feel much more at ease knowing I'm not alone. The goal is to get to one day, just one day without nicotine and I'm on my way.

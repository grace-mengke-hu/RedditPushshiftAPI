It gets easier... after a lapse?

So I started quitting at the 10th of June and had a terrible first week, where the idea of going out and buying a pack was constantly on top of my mind.

So, last Saturday, I finally caved after having gone through a couple of almost caves already. Smoked one cigarette. Smoked one more. Felt so bad about myself I went to my brothers place and have my little niece talk some more guilt into me. Threw away the rest of the pack there and then and havent looked back since.

I've reset all my progress which, to be completely honest, feels a little bit demotivating but I'm almost back at the same progress before lapsing and I've noticed that ever since lapsing, the glorious idea of having just one more cigarette is no longer there. 

Feels like I've been there and it wasn't all that special to be honest.

Basically that's all. Maybe it helps someone else, maybe I just wanted to rant a little about it, since I have no others to rant about it to. Thanks :-)

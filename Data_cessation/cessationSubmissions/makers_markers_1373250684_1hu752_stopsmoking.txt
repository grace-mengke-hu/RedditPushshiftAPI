I forgot my quit day was in June, not July. Three years of not smoking came and went without me realizing it until today!

For anyone interested, I wrote up some thoughts on quitting and my progress two years ago under an old account. [You can still read it here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/hur1c/i_havent_taken_one_puff_from_a_cigarette_in_a/)

I hope that every single one of you quitters will someday forget how long it's been and not even realize how far you've come!

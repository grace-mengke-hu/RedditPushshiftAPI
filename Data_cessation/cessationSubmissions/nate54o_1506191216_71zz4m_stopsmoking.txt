something i never noticed

i never noticed how the smokes make me so lethargic. i quit and quit and quit many times this year. finally, 2 days ago, i had my last smoke and completely lost all my urges. i dont know what happened. ok, i have a very slight sensation every now and then, but i think it was the smokes i was having (newports). i switched boxes (newport platinum, gray box), and they werent as strong, which made me want another one less frequently. 

i went to get my oil changed this morning. i usually wake up, have a smoke, get my oil changed, come back home, have a smoke, and fall right back asleep. now i cleaned the majority of my apartment (to a single guy's standards lol) and i feel great. i was always scared of quitting because i didnt know what life would be like not smoking, even though i had only been smoking for a few years. crazy.

anyway, yeah.

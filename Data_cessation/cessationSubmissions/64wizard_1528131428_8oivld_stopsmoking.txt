This will be the last "attempt", because I'm going to do it this time. 30 hours without a cigarette.

Currently using a Juul, and after I'm done with butts, I'm going to get a different vaporizer that I can use 3mg, and eventually 0mg juices in.

I'm 25 and I've been smoking for 8 years now. 

Both my parents smoke, and my dad is currently in end stage COPD, confined to oxygen machines 24/7.

I love my dad, but at the same time I am so angry at him. I won't let him know how angry I am, because I need to be there for him. But I'll be damned if I'm going to put my future kids and SO through that. I don't want my kid(s) to ever feel the way that I do right now, helpless and losing your best friend (my father).

I hate cigarettes more than anything right now, as I watch my dad waste away.

This has pushed me to stop. For real. No half assing it this time.

I'm done.

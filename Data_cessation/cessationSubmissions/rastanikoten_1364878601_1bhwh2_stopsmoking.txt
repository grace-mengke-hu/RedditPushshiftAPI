36 hours, no cigs. The cravings are intensifying but my will is strong.

I am noticing that sometimes after a strong craving I get a foggy feeling in my brain for about 10 minutes. During this period, I don't feel very sharp. I feel like part of my brain has said "Closed for maintenance" I'm sort of on auto-pilot, functioning on diminished cognitive function--still able to remember and recognize and feel but unable to generate internal dialogue. The best way I can describe it is it's like having a long case of being tongue tied.

Is there a science to this that someone can ELI5?

I have experienced this problem before and that's why I have give up on previous quit attempts.

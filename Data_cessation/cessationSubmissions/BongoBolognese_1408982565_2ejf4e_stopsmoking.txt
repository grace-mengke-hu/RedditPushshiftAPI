50 days

I haven't checked r/stopsmoking for a few days now. Last week I was on vacation in italy with my girlfried. We went their by car, traveling more than 2000 km in heavy traffic. When I was a smoker, after like two hours of driving I usually stopped to have a smoke (I never smoked in my car as my gf did not like that). Yesterday I drove 6h without a stop. When we arrived at home my girlfriend asked me if it was hard to not smoke during the ride.

This was the exact moment I thought about smoking the first and only time that day!

A 1 Year Thank You!

When I first quit, I relied on the posts of this community to encourage me to keep going and to make sure I wasn’t losing my mind. Reading others’ posts, really helped me realize that I wasn’t alone in what I was going through. Now one year into my quit, I just want to say thank you!  I also want to let those that are in the earlier stages of their quit that the feelings and cravings will subside and it does eventually get easier.

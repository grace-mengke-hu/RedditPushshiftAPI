One month smoke free!

After 36 years, this is an accomplishment. One of the things that helps me the most, ironically, is keeping a pack of cigarettes in my purse.  I know it sounds weird but when I know I have cigarettes to smoke, I know I can also talk myself out of having one.  It also reminds me why I had to quit.  This little pack of 20 cancer sticks has been in control of my life for a long time.  It's time I tamed the b*tch!

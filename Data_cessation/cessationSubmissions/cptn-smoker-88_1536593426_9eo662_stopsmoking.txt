Day 12 - going strong

My energy has increased, in turn my productivity. I have bipolar disorder so I have some fears of mania, but so far my friends and loved ones have enjoyed the new energetic me. I started working out again using the Nike+ Training app, and all the workouts are way easier! I've even set a new personal record. Running feels AMAZING.

When I have cravings, which is largely when I have downtime, am driving, or in a social setting, I hit the Juul. Gone thru a few pods already, I like the Mango best. I'm conscious of my use tho, bc I actually want to SAVE money. Got rid of the Chantix, this was my second time taking it, the first time I didn't last two days bc of the weight gain. (Yes I know I am vain.)

I'm feeling confident, but not cocky! Looking forward to day 365.

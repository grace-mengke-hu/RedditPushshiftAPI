Starting Today

I enjoy and love smoking, but it's time to stop. I've been smoking for two years, not heavy maybe 4 or 5 a day, but my lungs are hurting. For real hurting, just a deep breath and it hurts bad. I also feel pain in my toes and fingers, maybe not related, but it sure as hell isn't going to be anymore. Any advice is good advice, I have an ecig I plan to use (with no nicotine) just so that idle fingers don't go reach for tobacco.
Thanks!

Looking for advice from Chantix users (4 days btw!)

I'm on my first week of Chantix.  One of the main side effects I've noticed is drowsiness and fatigue.  The dreams are a little weird too but I knew to expect that from a friend.  So far I'm on my 7th day of pills and my 4th day of no cigarettes.  I was even able to have a few beers last night without smoking, which is huge for me.  My questions are this:
1.  Is the fatigue common?  I know it says it on the box, but they have to say that if it is even a small percentage of users experience it.
2.  How long after you quit did you keep taking the pills?  I'd like to stop taking them as soon as possible to get my energy back, but I don't want to start craving cigarettes again.

Thanks guys and keep it up everyone!

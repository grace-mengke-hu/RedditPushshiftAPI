Had a small victory last night...

So I went to the pub with a few mates, all of which smoke when they drink. I was the only one at the table that didn't have a smoke and just a week ago I was the heaviest smoker out of all my friends. Everyone congratulated me and said my skin looks better and I look healthier. I'm feeling great right now...

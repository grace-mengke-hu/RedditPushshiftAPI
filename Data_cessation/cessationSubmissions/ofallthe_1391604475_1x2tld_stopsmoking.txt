What a crap morning!

I think I may have had that moment of realization. 

This morning sucked balls. I had to wake up and shovel snow. The heavy wet kind that breaks your back. My 2 year old threw up in his sleep and the wife had to clean that up. Neither of us was in a good mode.

We were just picking and snapping at each other. Which lead to yelling and screaming. Just a horrid start to the day. I put on my boots and left for the bus just cursing up a storm under my breath.

The whole bus ride to my train I'm just fuming mad. I mean "curse some ones eyes pissed off at the world" kind of mad.

It wasn't until I got on the train and started checking reddit that I realized something. Not once did the thought of having a cigarette enter my mind. Sure I was pissed, but I handled it without wanting a smoke.

I stated chuckling to myself. This is a great day.

A few stupid questions? :)

Hello. I've stopped (obviously not successful, but it was my desicion every time to go back) smoking many times. And its different every time. First time was the hardest. I had many simptoms like: I couldnt sleep (deeply) or I slept less, dizziness, couldnt focus/concentrate, nervousness (all these)... Every next time I stopped was easier. And I dont get all the symptoms again. Is this normal? I mean last time I stopped (for 20 days) without any problems at all. Nothing happened. Just the dizziness appeared after like 30 hours and like one night I couldnt sleep so well (but still slept enough) :) This time (is my last time for sure!) I'm nervous (only this!) but I didnt get the insomnia and the dizziness? Is this normal? I hope you get my point... Some of the symptoms are missing and I get something else (compared to the previous time)? Excuse my simple/stupid usage of english but its not at very good level :D Im just curious. Thanks for reading ;d

That last vestige of self control

Went out with old friends last night. They all have cut smoking down to social times only. We were all SO drunk, I'm really proud of myself for managing to not smoke the whole night. It wasn't even ask that difficult, I just imagined what a cigarette would ACTUALLY be like. I smelt them when they came back in, and I really didn't feel like I wanted to be nicotine's little bitch anymore. 

Proud of myself, and proud of all of you who manage to do this too.

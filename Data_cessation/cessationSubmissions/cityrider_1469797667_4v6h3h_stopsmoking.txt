One month down. My Respiratory system hates me.

It was difficult for the first three days but got much easier afterwards. My lungs feel like shit. Feel like I'm always clearing my throat of mucus. It makes my annoyed that I started smoking in the first place.  I have been working out daily and eating clean for the most part and still have days I just don't feel all that great. 

Anyone else experience this? And if so how long did it last for you?

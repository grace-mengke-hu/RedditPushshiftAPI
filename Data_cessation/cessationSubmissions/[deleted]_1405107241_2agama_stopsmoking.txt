Former regular smoker, now social smoker, need to STOP!

30/F here, started smoking casually somewhere in my mid-teen years, took it up regularly from about 18-25, then slipped into a social habit (I only smoke now when I'm drinking, but I can go through 10+ cigarettes a night). 

I know I'm not physically addicted to it anymore, it's more of a mental craving, but apart from cutting back on drinking, which I've already done, any pointers on getting over that last mental hurdle?

Good luck to everyone!!

Wait, I'm never going to smoke again? That thought is still scary.

At about 11:00pm last Thursday I finished the last smoke I had in my pack and decided that I was done.  I have been a somewhat casual smoker at maybe 1-2 packs a week, but recently I saw that I was smoking more and more.  I hated that I loved it.  I couldn't wait for my kids to go to bed so I could go outside.  I could barely enjoy time with my non-smoking friends because I was dreaming of going outside.  I hated the way I knew I smelled even though I felt like I didn't.  The final straw was realizing that I have been smoking for 19 years (minus pregnancies), YUCK.  Enough is enough!  I've tried all sorts of methods in the past.  This time I just decided to stop.  I read "the book" everyone is always talking about and I think it's helpful.  So far it's actually been very easy.  Thoughts come and go without much effort to fight any urges or cravings.  I just take a deep breath and it usually passes.  Yet I have been here before.  It's always easy for me the first week or too.  It's the long haul where I have stumbled in the past.

The one thing I can't wrap my head around is never, ever, having another cigarette again.  Not one with a drink now and then... or one on a stressful day... not one ever.  That is what I want, but I can’t seem to picture it.  I’m as ready as ever to do this and I want to get my head around that concept, because if I don't I feel like I'll be doomed to eventually just give in.  Any suggestions?

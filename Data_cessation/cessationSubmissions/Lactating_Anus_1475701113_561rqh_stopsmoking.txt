A few thoughts on day 3000.

It wasn't my first quit. It wasn't even my best quit. But here I am still chipping away one day at a time. Although I may be proud of my self on a day like today. I am infinitesimally prouder of all of you just starting out on this journey.

I'm an addict and an alcoholic. It's been 3000 days since my last smoke, 110 since my last drink, and it does get easier most days. 

Just remember why You are doing this.

I quit for my wife, my friends, my brother and my parents.

I quit to be a better rolemodel to my nieces and nephews 

I quit to grow as a chef and a person.

But most importantly I quit for me. My happiness, my life, my future, and gosh darn-it don't we all deserve the same.

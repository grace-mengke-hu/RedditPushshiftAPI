35 days smoke-free

A few people have messaged me for advice on quitting smoking, so I thought I'd write out a few things that worked for me:

1. Use a "crutch" when you're going through the hard days (first 10). For me, a vape in a fun flavor worked. I chose Cannoli Be One by Cassadaga Liquids: http://www.myvaporstore.com/Cannoli-Be-One-by-C…/g2-xcan.htm. As for the vape, I use the SubVod ($30): https://www.myvaporstore.com/Kangertech-SUBVOD-S…/krsv10.htm

2. Download an app to track your progress. I found this to be very motivating! Quit Tracker is great.

3. Do the things you'd normally do - just don't smoke. For me, achieving behavioral milestones like "going to the bar," "driving to work," and "going out for coffee" were crucial in proving to myself that I could do it. I do find myself still going outside with smokers "for a smoke" - I just vape instead.

4. Be strategic when choosing a time to quit. For me, traveling for work was a great time because it shook up my entire routine.

5. Let people know that you're quitting and that you may be super cranky. I had a few days where I thought I was going to die. Even on those days, stay strong. Use your "crutch" if necessary. I'm lucky to have friends and colleagues who have been super supportive! <3

6. Note the positive aspects of being smoke-free. For me, being able to sing in the car without fighting for a breath has been a great perk. Also, food tastes fantastic now. It's like I'm stoned. lol I recommend a calorie-counter app. I no longer have to be ashamed about how I smell, and my teeth have gotten whiter. Even through the hard days, it's been worth it. I recommend quitting to anyone who wants to!

It feels great!

Hi All. :) I was about to write here 2 weeks ago however i couldn't be sure whether i should share or not. But here i am, looking good, feeling good. I would like to give a quick summary on what's happening when you quit. At least these are what happened to me.

I was mentally ready, actually i was extremely focused that "i had enough" of smokes in my life. Not because of the money that i'm spending or the health issues, I'm working in a reputable bank, as an assistant manager and gosh, that smell. it was killing everything. 

I started using champix and on day 13 i quit. first days of champix wasn't bad. right now the only thing i feel when i take a champix is the excruciating cramps in my stomach only for a couple of minutes but it does pass as i drink water. 

I'm 31 years old and have been smoking more than 12 years. Last days, I have been smoking 2 packs per day and i felt, my body is crying for help. I was having hard time when i woke up because I'm 1,85 cm and got weight more than 15 kg (makes a total 110 kg) due to a small little depression. so i decided i should quit. 

- 1stday was absolutely the worst. I was with my mother that day and the pain in my hand was excruciating. I remember that i slept at 20:00 pm due to the pain. I had cold sweats at the work. I was drinking cold water all day (like 4 lt at least) it helped too much. 

-My second day was a lot better.

-Third day i started to feel like my body was getting rid of that addiction and nicotine. Also i felt like, i was smelling better. (not taste though, as opposed what they say on internet, that came a week later)

- when i hit the 1st week mark, i felt that my bereathing ability became better. Of course not a guy like never smoked, however no more chest pains. I was walking like 3 km everyday since the first day that i quit. Later, i make it like 7-8 km. God, it feels too good when you walk on the evening between trees, and that oxygen feels so damn good. :) 

- Now I'm on 3rd week mark. They told me that this is a time to relapse however i didn't feel any need or urge to smoke and there is an extremely huge probability that i will never smoke again in my life (i'm an engineer btw lol). i actually leave it behind, right now my second priority to get fit. after i quit smoking, i get rid of 3 kgs of my excessive weight and would like to be 95 kg again. it's not the urge that you'd like to eat because you don't. it's only blood sugar. Nicotine effects you blood sugar in couple of seconds where you need to wait your blood sugar to rise like 20 minutes when you eat. During that time, just drink water. It helps. 

Also please, never get afraid of not succeeding. because i remember, i decided to give up smoking, and 15 minutes later i gave up and smoked a cigarette. I couldn't know that was my last. :)

I hope everything's gonna get better and better.

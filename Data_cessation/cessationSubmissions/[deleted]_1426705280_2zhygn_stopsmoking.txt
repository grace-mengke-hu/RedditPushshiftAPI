Everything hurts... what is going on? Help.

I am going on my third day without a cigarette, everything hurts. Why do I feel physical pain? I had a panic attack last night. I feel like something is seriously wrong with me. Is this withdrawal? Has anybody else ever felt like this? I feel really beaten down right now, I am having a hard time focusing in class. I am fighting the urge, but my resolve is dwindling.

Day 4 was too much again. I'm hopeless

Hey Reddit. Any advice?

I have been smoking cigarettes for 10 years now, mostly a pack a day. It has always been my crutch and companion. Have been doing quit attempts every year. Nothing really seems to work. I'm starting to feel hopeless about quitting as it never seems to work.. Somehow, in the back of my mind I have a feeling I will succeed someday. Just need to find a way..

• Have read Allen Carr's book 3 times, always get great motivation to quit but cave in after 1-7 days
• Have switched to swedish snus. It's easy to do and the lungs start healing. But the constant supply of nicotine is so much I find myself being a bit "off" and exhausted all day
• Cold turkey 3-4 times, lasting for a week
• Nicotine gum - horrible
• Vaping. It led me to chaining all day, especially with low-nic. 0-nic felt "pointless" to smoke..
• Practice yoga 3-5 times a week, eat mostly healthy

What can someone do in a situation like this? When I don't have a cigarette for a few days I get into this dream-like state where things are surreal. A portion of my day goes to fighting, like "I want a cigarette" 
- "no, you can't" - "please?" In this state I feel like I'm living for nothing, like my days are spent just waiting for them to end. 
Mental clarity is heightened, aswell as the senses. It's amazing but at the same time exhausting. Need to get out of it....just for a moment.

After some time I cave in. The first hit of nicotine makes me relaxed, content with the whole world. 
It feels like I have been wearing a 40-pound armor for a few days straight, and then get to get it off. Feels like a feather again! I can fly through a day and be friendly to people.

Then after a day or two, smoking a few cigarettes, I get numb again. Just smoking cigarettes to get through the day, no big feelings. Clarity has gone, I want to quit again. 

What could the lesson in this be? Thank you for listening /stopsmoking

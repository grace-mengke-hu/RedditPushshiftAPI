Misconceptions that lead to previous failures

Ok, I read the Allen Carrs easy way and had quit for a few days with no problems until I had my first REAL craving. I thought I had failed and caved. I re-read the book with the same exact results. Day 4 and there I was again!  Now this time I got the audio book, which in my opinion, did a way better job at explaining things. First off, you wil have cravings. Your mind will try and pull those same mental gymnastics that it always does trying to convince you that a cigarette is the answer. But this time I understand it will happen and it's not failure. It's not that you WONT have a craving, it's that you'll have a totally logical and CORRECT answer to them. I'm totally psyched!  I know the answer to the problem and it's "Shut up brain, you're a dirty drug addicted liar! Let's move on, shall we :)". Fortunately I had a buddy coming to visit for 5 days. A non-smoker who will surely be a great role model as I watch them get drunk, eat food, drink coffee and never once needing a cigarette.  Id say wish me luck, but that's like wishing someone luck on a test that they have the cheat sheet for. 

Thanks!

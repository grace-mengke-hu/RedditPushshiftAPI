How I was Censored by the Reddit Mods on the Health Subreddit

I recently posted in the r/Health subreddit about how I became a non-smoker, trying to help a fellow person who is struggling with smoking cessation because I know what a killer disease is. 

Shockingly however, I was banned within minutes, seconds even to my utter dismay. I can’t believe that in this era of free speech and where we are coming out of the shadows of the past, I am being censored. Yeah CENSORED for speaking out the truth. And that too by the medical health section of Reddit. 

The funny thing is among the subreddits I posted of r/stopsmoking and r/cigarettes, r/health was the one who banned me. As much as people at r/cigarettes hated my post, they did not CENSOR me! What does this say? 

Below is the response I got after ages on why I was banned. 

The moderator’s response was that the book I posted was “rubbish”. 

I didn’t realize that a mod could ban my opinion or experience based on his/her opinion. 

I have not violated any terms or rules. Because the mod did not respond and tell me that I violated any rules but the response was that my post was “rubbish”. 

If it was rubbish, why not let redditors decide that and vote it down. Why censor it? 

I post here hoping you guys will read it and support me that freedom of thought and expression cannot be censored in our day and age. 

If I violated any posting rules,  shouldn’t the mods let me know so I could modify the post?

Today is day 5

Just waking on day 5 of having chosen health and wellness as a priority in my life!! Fuck I'm proud of my stubbornness to see this through!!!

Visualizing the hard road ahead, I have been thinking about this evening.  I am to join friends at a bar for a show.  Everyone will be drinking and smoking and staying out late..I of course am enjoying 30 days of sobriety so I'll not have anything to drink and of course will not be smoking...I'm just thinking about being around all those folks that are using.  I might be keen to just say fuck it and not go, but I've been super lonely as I work and live alone...I need to be around some people or I'll lose my mind.

Apart from not going, does anyone have any advice on how best to stay the course in an environment like the one I've described?

Many thanks!!

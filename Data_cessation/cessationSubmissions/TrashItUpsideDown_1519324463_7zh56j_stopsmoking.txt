Giving it a shot

I'm tired of not tasting food. I'm tired of spending all my money on booze and cigarettes. I'm tired of removing myself from social situations to go outside. I'm tired of planning my commute around when I need to buy a pack. I'm just tired of it so here goes. Trying to be sober and smoke starting now.

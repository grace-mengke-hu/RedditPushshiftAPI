Has anyone ever tried hypnotherapy?

I've been back and forth with quitting more times than I can count. I've read books, quit buying packs, used the patch, tried the lozenge, etc. I've heard that people are using hypnotherapy and I was interested in giving it a try. Any insight would be a great help. Thanks in advance!

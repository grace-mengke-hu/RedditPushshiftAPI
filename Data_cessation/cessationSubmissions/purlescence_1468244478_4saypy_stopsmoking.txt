3 Weeks

- I can't believe how deeply I can breathe and how much easier exercise is
- By this point I've worked almost all the gunk out of my system and my smoker's cough is virtually gone
- I get maybe one craving per day, if that
- I'm firmly out of the "eat whatever you want" phase and can drink alcohol without thinking about cigarettes

Y'all it is SO GOOD where I'm at. Keep going!

I really must stop, . Please help

I have been smoker for 10 years.  
I smoke 20-25 per day. My fiancee hated it and at first breakup I promised I would stop. 
I did by cold turkey and wasnt sleeping for few days, trembling, Angry and depressed
But I made it and was proud for one year. 
Fiancee cheated on me, by grandpa died and I found a cigarette. I hated it but started smoking again.
I also did a lot of weed every day to help me sleep. I vomit because of it and yet the urge was strong enough to continue this nasty shit. 
Now I must end it. I read Allan Carr book and realize it was all just illusion, i dont need it in first place.
But I am still a bit worried with next few weeks, any advice will help a lot. Please I am alone on this and need help other then therapist i visit.

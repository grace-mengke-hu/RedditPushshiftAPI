Finding it hard to take the first step - any advice?

I've been smoking for 5 years, generally get through a 20 pack per day. I'm now at the point where, what I used to enjoy, I now hate but can't seem to bring myself to make the first step and actually resist any of my cravings. I've realised that they stink, make my mouth taste like crap, are costing me a fortune and are seriously impacting my health (only really noticed these things over the past couple of weeks) but every morning, as soon as I wake up, I have a smoke.

I started to cut down dramatically a few weeks ago, when I was diagnosed with OCD. I'd been having treatment for general anxiety and having the new diagnosis has been hard to accept. So I did what I've always done and turned back to cigarettes to stop me from confronting what the real issue is. 

I guess what I'm looking for is advise for that first smoke free day and something to concentrate on to help me resist from sparking up as soon as I wake up. Any help would be genuinely appreciated.

I'm on hour 65

This is going a lot easier than i thought, second day was torture but third is almost over, and I'm barely feeling any cravings. Sometimes I look out at a window, and think for a second I should go out for a cigarette, but aside from that no problems. Been smoking for 4 years, since I was 15, haven't tried quitting in like a year, so feeling really good about how its going :). Thanx for reading my ramble.

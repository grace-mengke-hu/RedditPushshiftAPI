So for badges sake, do black-out nights not count as a reset?

I am doing really well (my second real attempt) but the fact is that my friends and myself enjoy drinking. And if I start drinking... we all know that road. I have limited myself to one or two on drinking nights and can abstain for the rest of the time... 

So I guess my real question is am I ruining my chances of quitting?
I am going cold turkey other than these drinking nights.

edit- so since half of the responses include mentions of alcoholism, I will clarify. St. Patties '12 was the last time  I "blacked out". I merely used the term for drama. Thanks for you concern.

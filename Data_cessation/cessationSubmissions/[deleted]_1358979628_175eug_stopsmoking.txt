Nicotine-Free Herbal Cigarettes?

I was wondering about these, now, I know when i wanted to stop smoking I wanted to get away from the addictions, etc. 

Now that I have stopped I feel healthier, better, and more active.

Yet I haven't went out drinking or have been dealing with alcohol situations because of the craving I fear.

Now, has anyone tried herbal cigs when drinking?

I know I should stay away from smoking over all, but... I was wondering if these would help or hinder me?

I am doing fine sober, but I don't want to be having these thoughts in the back of my mind that I will be always missing something when I go out and drink/party.

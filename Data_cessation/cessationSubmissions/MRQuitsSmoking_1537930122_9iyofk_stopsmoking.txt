Day One A Couple Hours In

Reddit stopsmoking, 

I quit smoking 8 months ago for 5 months but relapsed and got heavy back into it during the summer. Cravings are in the morning with coffee, after sex and after work shifts. Any tips on what I can replace smoking with during these cravings? The last time I quit for awhile, I did it no problem cold turkey. I've been trying to quit for the past couple weeks but it's been a lot harder this time, the only way I want to do it is cold turkey. Any tips on what to replace a smoke craving with?

Thanks

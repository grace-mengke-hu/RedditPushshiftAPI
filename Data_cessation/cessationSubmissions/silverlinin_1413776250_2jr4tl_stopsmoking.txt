Dad's Huge Belly after Quitting Smoking

Help. My dad has stopped smoking about 3-4 years ago and has a huge round belly that is extremely obvious. He's about 59 years old and it's so hard to encourage him to exercise. Old people are known for their stubbornness. Is there a way to fix his belly issue?

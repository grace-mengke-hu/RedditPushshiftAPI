day 12

Have decided to stop vaping as well. I'm day 3 nicotine free and already feeling considerably better, no more dizziness and I feel kind of calm now.
 
I'm also reading the Allen Carr's book right now and it helps staying motivated immensely, I think I'm even going to reread it throughout the quit period.

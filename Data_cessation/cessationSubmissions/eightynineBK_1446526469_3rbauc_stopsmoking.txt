Scrubbed off a nicotine stain on my tooth! Quitting while ahead âœ¨

I scrubbed a brown nicotine stain off of my front teeth. I thought it was the beginning of a misfortunately located cavity at first. I've been smoking on and off for four years and I can't believe I got one in the first place. So, my newly white teeth and I are quitting cigarettes as of now âœ¨ðŸ’« 

For the record, a baking soda scrub followed by a long rinse with hydrogen peroxide did the trick. I had to repeat the process several times but it was well worth it.

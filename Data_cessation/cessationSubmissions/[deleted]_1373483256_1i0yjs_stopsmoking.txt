Nearing 4 days of no cigarettes.

I have to give HUGE credit to Allen Carr. He has made this journey soooo much easier. 


I now completely understand what I was doing wrong with the last dozen times when I tried to quit. It really is easy now. I was a pack a day habit for quite some time, but this has really been easy. The only time I really had "withdrawal pangs", as he calls it, was the first day. I now realize that it's just my body feeling scared with a mixture of the brain washing that I have gone through. 


To any newcomers, please please PLEASE read, or listen to, Allen Carr's Easy Way to Stop Smoking. It has helped me tremendously.

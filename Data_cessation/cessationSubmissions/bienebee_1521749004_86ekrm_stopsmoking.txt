Day 3 - weak cravings - quitting cause I literally have no money for them

This is my second quit attempt, I was going to quit anyway this year (an undetermined point of time before 2019), then I hurt my nose which made me spend 3 weeks worth of grocery money in one day. I told myself I'd quit again after I finish my tobacco pack (which had  maybe 5 more cigs in it) and I did. Trying to convert the injury that happened to me into a positive thing. In about 2 months I'll stop working and start living off my savings in order to focus on passing entrance and language exams for a Masters program abroad I want. 

These 3 days have been ok. On my previous quit attempt I was murderous days 3-4 and 17-18. My last relapse happened around the middle of month 3. I feel normal now, but I'm aftraid that the shitstorm is just lurking behind my shoulder. I can't seem to believe that this is going without the paralizing anxiety that happened during my first quit. Complacency screwed me the last time, so I've almost convinced myself now that having no obvious withdrawal symptoms this time is a bad thing. Somehow. 

Not even sure does this post have a point, as I rad what I just wrote I realize I'm far from coherent üòÅ Thank you for existing all, I loved every single success story I read here!

Withdrawal is about more than quitting ciggs for me.

TL;DR Getting cerebral whilst in pain.

I've quit smoking about 3 times before in the last 4-5 years using E-Cigs, Snus, Nicorette. Never lasted long and usually ended up mildly addicted to the NRT. 


Now, smoking for about 11 years. I'm 29. I'm almost 24 hours in and I'm starting to have some bouts of heavy depression. Finished watching that doc Scorsese did on George Harrison. 


Here I am thinking to myself that instead of missing the Cigarettes, I'm missing how I used to feel before I started smoking. I don't think we realize the slavery, not just to the nicotine, but to solving problems in our lives by "thinking it over with a cigg". No. No. No.


My pleasure/reward system wants to take the easy route. I never take big risks because of the safety I feel with my ciggs. I feel pretty terrible right now, and I can barely type. The withdrawal is the pittance I am paying for not doing more with my 20s, with hopes that my 30s will be fucking amazing. 

That's why I am done.

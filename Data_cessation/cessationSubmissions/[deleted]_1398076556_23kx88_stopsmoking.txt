How to deal with living with smokers.

Hey guys and girls.

I'm smoke free just over 2 weeks now cold turkey, and feeling great for it. However, I live with my grandparents who both smoke in the kitchen all day long. It's making life quite difficult for me, as I need to, you know, eat and stuff like that.

I've voiced my concerns to them over and over again only to be met with hostility, and you know what? It fucking sucks. Here I am trying to do something pretty difficult and getting little to no support for it.

When I first stopped, they would smoke outside, and it was great, no conflict whatsoever. That has now gone out the window, and I'm the one in the wrong... apparently.

I've even tried asking that they smoke outside just when I'm in the house, and do whatever they feel like when I'm not there. I work 40 hours a week, so it's not exactly an unreasonable request.

What should I do here? I'm moving out in a few months, but until then, there has to be some way for us all to be happy.

**TL;DR** Living with smokers who are unwilling to compromise is making life very difficult for me.

If you're happy and you know it clap your hands!

30 Days.. 
30 long days.. 
I'm still trying to process it all. Somehow it feels like a lifetime and an instant all at the same time. 

30 Days.. 
That's over 722 hours..
34,300+ Minutes..
More than 2,600,000 Seconds..

But even more incredible than the time,  that's 600 cigarettes NOT SMOKED. 

I was sitting here a bit ago thinking about it all.  600... 600... 
That's a HUGE number.  I kept trying to visualize what a pile of 600 cigarette buttz would look like. 
 It would be ridiculously big.  
I then thought of all the crap and nicotine I wasn't pumping into my body,  and I took a deep breath.
  The deepest of deep.  On the exhale was when the emotions hit me.  I nearly cried.  30 fuuking days and 600 cigarettes not smoked. 

 There's no way I can say I don't hate it every single second of every single day,  cause I do.  I really do. 
 I don't know that I will ever adapt Into that mindset some people talk about.  I've tried the mantras..  Not one puff..  Blah blah..  It doesn't work for me. 
What has worked though is sheer bullheaded perseverance. I WILL emerge on the other side of this as a non smoker.  No matter what.  No matter how hard.  Nothing will stop me. 
 30 days are all mine and there is no way I'm giving that up.  
Smoking now would be a choice.  My body stopped needing the nicotine days ago.  If I chose to smoke now it would be of my own free will.  How could I do that to myself again..  That's fucking lame.  17 years ago when I started the damn habit,  I didn't Know the hell ahead of me.  Now I do and I will never be so stupid again.  
I want to smoke all the time.  I just won't. For Once I'm using my stubbornness for good.  My momma would be so proud lol. 
Oh and did I mention....  30 stinkin' days!?! üòÅ sorry..  I'm just  Little proud.  Haha

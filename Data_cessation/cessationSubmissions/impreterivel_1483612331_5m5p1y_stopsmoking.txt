Day 5 and kinda scared

Hi! So this is the second time I'm trying to quit cold turkey and I'm not agitated or  with mood swings, I didn't felt that way the first time too.

The problems will begin in like a week or so with the feeling that I'm  supposedly more relaxed and confident and I think I have it under control, I begin to have serious cravings.

Does someone else feels or felt the same way?

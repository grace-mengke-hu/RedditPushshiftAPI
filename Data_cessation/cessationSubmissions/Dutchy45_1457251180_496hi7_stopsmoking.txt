wanting a cig

It's morning over here. The first cigarette of the day always was the best one for me. Yesterday was easier, 2 days ago was easier still. I feel like today is going to be difficult. It's so easy for me to ask myself: Why don't I have a cigarette if I want/feel like/deserve one. I decided to post here for now instead (hope it helps). maybe it's a good idea to post my reasons for wanting to quit, so here goes in no particular order. It's a ridiculous waste of money. My mother died 6 months ago from complications from smoking. 2 flights of stairs leave me winded (a source of amusement to some of my non smoking friends). My cat!! has emphysema. I can't fall asleep laying on my back because I breath to shallow and don't get enough oxygen and as a result I sleep terribly. I only partially taste food. I wake up with a dry mouth because my nose can't give me enough air. I'm an addict, a slave to nicotine. Just for today I will try very hard not to smoke. Succes to everybody struggling today.

Awww yeah here we go, it's finally my big day!

And all I can say to you guys is that quitting nicotine was the best decision I've made in a long time and succeeding after 6 years of smoking a pack a day did wonders for my confidence and resolve.

You can fucking do it. The beginning is tough as nails but it only gets easier and easier. Good luck, I believe in you :)

Sharing a helpful discovery

Hey all,

Longtime lurker, first time poster here. I just wanted to share a little discovery I made in my process, and I hope it helps some of you continue the good fight.

Anyways, we all know how hard it can be when you see, smell, or otherwise encounter someone else smoking a cigarette. Instead of entertaining feelings of jealousy, or feeling nostalgic for feeling of smoking, I found it really helpful to tell myself "I'm so glad I don't have to do that anymore." Even if I don't really believe what I'm saying in the moment, I try to repeat it until I do believe it.

Anyway, thanks to all of you for sharing your stories. This is a wonderful community, and I'm very grateful for the inspiration and  support!

Day 3 starting.

I wonder what I did wrong,  my badge still says day 1? I shall check into it. 

Still doing this thing! I will be totally honest and tell you that I think this is one of the hardest things I have ever done. Which in a way makes me angry, because I did this to myself. BUT! That anger drives me forward. I have a bit of a competition going on between me and the nicotine monster. It keeps trying to lure me back and I have vowed to do everything I can to push it further away. 

Last night I cooked a nice dinner and when I cook I love to drink a few beers or a couple of glasses of wine and like most people drinking and smoking go together. But I had 3 beers and did not light up a single cigarette. It felt a bit strange, yes. I can't deny it. But I lit some incense and played music and just got swept up in the sounds and scents and moved on. I don't know that I would go out for a night of social drinking at the bar quite yet, but I was very pleased with being able to have a couple drinks at home and not fall.

I do have some nicotine gum bought from an attempt 3 months ago but I am not planning to use it. I know from everything I have read on this sub that I just need to get past another couple days and the physical addiction will be better. The headaches will get better, the tiredness will go away. It's all temporary. I will not smoke today.

How is everyone else doing? Talk to me people! I want to hear your struggles and gains!

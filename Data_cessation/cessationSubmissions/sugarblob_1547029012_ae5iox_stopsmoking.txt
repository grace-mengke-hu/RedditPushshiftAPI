Quitting smoking, planting trees instead

I've come to notice that the price of a tree and a pack of cigarettes are similar, after years (5+) of attempting to quit repeatedly, the association of whether I want a pack of cigarettes or to plant a tree has encouraged me the most by far, in the past 2 days I havn't even had the thought of buying a pack.

     The normal symptoms of being tired or irritable seem to be at bay, as something I need to deal with to accomplish my goal of creating a forest.  Everyone will have a different "forest".  It took many things falling apart for me to realize what truly makes me happy, and if I focus my energy on that, instead of covering up short term emotions with a drug, the long term will be green.

42 days since Last Vaping Nicotine!

Fuck yeaaah!  I stopped paying attention somewhere around day 24.  (Smoker and and off for 12 years until I got into vaping in January).

Guys, it's fucking scary, I was jogging outside and there was a guy parked with his car with LOUD music and windows completely closed.... I COULD SMELL THE SMOKE VIOLENTLY GUSHING out even with the windows closed it smelled just as if I was trapped inside the car with him....  AND THEN IT HIT ME.... Oh SHIT, I must've embarrassed the fuck out of myself...my clothes....my smell walking into classrooms, elevators,etc.  Heck, If that guy would've exited his car and walked past me even 30 mins later... I would've detected a human ashtray passing by me................How embarrassing.... I was worse. Way worse...


You don't get the full picture of drug addiction until you are outside watching! 


I encourage and I want all of you to KNOW you can do this. Just STOP giving up and GET BACK on track. ALL it takes is 2 weeks of your life and then I promiss you'll look back and say SHIT I WAS AN IDIOT!!


P.S  at the VERY least go buy yourself a VAPE.  You're gonna smell good at least and your reputation won't take a HUGE dive.

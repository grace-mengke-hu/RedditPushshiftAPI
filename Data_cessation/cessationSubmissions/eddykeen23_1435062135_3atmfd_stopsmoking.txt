8 days smoke free. Tempted to do some nicotine free vape.

Hi all,

I'm 8 days smoke / nicotine free. For the last month that I was smoking, I was actually vaping and found it quite enjoyable.

Now that I'm 8 days nicotine free, I don't think that I feel any nicotine cravings but I do miss the breaks during the workday and the taste of the e-liquids with vaping. 
Does anyone here have experience with nicotine-free vaping as a non-compulsive / non-addictive hobby or is this the addict in me trying to find an opening?

Thanks

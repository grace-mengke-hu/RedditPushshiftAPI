Quit tobacco yesterday, using e-cig for nicotine replacement...

Hey all. I housesit for a friend who really hates cigarette smoke and so I got an e-cig. It worked. I didn't even really want a regular cigarette, and it especially helped that I didn't have any around. So, I thought I would make it official. Rationed myself down from 20+ cigs a day to five per day. Then waited until I ran out of regular cigarettes, which was yesterday. Today was my first full day without any tobacco and I am feeling good about it. 

Still, I've heard that people who use e-cigs don't quit at high rates and it end up actually hurting your chances. I think it is going to work for me, but I wanted to drop a line here and see if any who've tried this have any advice or pitfalls to avoid or anything like that. Thanks all.

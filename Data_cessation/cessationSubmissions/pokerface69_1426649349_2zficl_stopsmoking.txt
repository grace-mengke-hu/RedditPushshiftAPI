50 days and here's how I did it :)

I decided to open stopsmoking and check my badge and it was 50 days! so I wanted to write a few words that might help others just starting :)

currently I feel no physical symptom, can stand with smokers when they smoke and not want it, hate the smell of smokers, can shout at top of my lungs and not have pain in my throat, and don't need to depend on a tar stick to go about my day. 

There are cravings but they're so small I can easily dismiss them. sometimes they're strong but that's very rare but they're also fight able :)

so here's how I made it so far :

cold turkey quit. 
extremely difficult first 3 days, managed to go thru them with lots of juice, engrossing myself in work all day, zero caffeine intake and taking proper rest. 

Everytime I felt a craving, I opened this forum on mobile and read as much as I could. 

after 3 days I felt a bit better for 1-2 days and then the real shit strom came. cravings and depression and stomach ache and what not. 

kept drinking fluids, didn't do much of outside communication just office buddies and kept doing my work. 
started smoking a quarter of nicotine free joint before sleeping. 

There were good days , bad days , shitty days, but this forum was a huge help, posting here or reading here helped me a lot to control my cravings. 
I still open this forum once a day but read only one or two entries. 

last two weeks I've been travelling like crazy all over India and did not smoke even once :)

also had couple of intense smoke dreams. 

join me today in not smoking.

For those of you with many days quit already - when did you stop *thinking* about smoking?

I don't want to smoke. But in being mindful about this process, I realize that I think about cigarettes a LOT. Even as I don't want one, they're still on my mind.

Did this happen to you, and if so, when did you notice it started to change? 

Heading into Day 21 and it feels like a major milestone :)

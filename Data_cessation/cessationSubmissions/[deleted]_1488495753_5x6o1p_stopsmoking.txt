swapping one addiction for another?

All I want to do is _____.  It took me the better part of two years to stop drinking to the point of brown out every night.  I am now 6 days into not smoking, and I've gone back to drinking. Not much, but I know that some can easily lead to excess. I swore this morning I would do neither. The lingo and tools are interchangeable. What am i lacking aside from willpower? Am I stuck with choosing between being a sober smoker or a drunk non-smoker?

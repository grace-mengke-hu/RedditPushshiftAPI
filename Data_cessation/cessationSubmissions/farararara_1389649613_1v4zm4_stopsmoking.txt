Two years and counting!

Hi everyone. Just wanted to drop in and offer some words of encouragement to all of you who have recently decided to quit and are going through the more challenging part of adjusting to a smoke-free life. Stick with it! Quitting is the best decision I ever made, and I can't imagine my life if I had not stuck with my decision to give it up for good. You will reach a point where you no longer think about it at all...and where the scent of someone else's cigarette grosses you out. Freedom from smoking is life-changing. Good luck :)

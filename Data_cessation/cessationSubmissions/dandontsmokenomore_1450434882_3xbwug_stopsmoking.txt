Screwed up yesterday - anybody have advice? gotta keep going!!

Last night I Screwed up. 1.5 smokes, crap loafs of vape, 1 bottle of wine, lots of puking. I think i only got drunk so i could 'justify' smoking and vaping. Do that's 25 days sober and 19 days nicotine free down the toilet.  I was feeling so strong, so happy with my decision,  but i did not put in place coping strategies for coming back to my home town for Christmas.  Am starting to see that all those boring sounding visualisation exercises and meditation practices that people swear by are perhaps back up; extra strength,  for when we're in situations that exhaust or scare or tempt us. I need to take this quit seriously,  and do the homework.  Anybody got any tips for good extra help practices?

My partner and I are quitting but I love smoking so much.

We picked a date and we quit.  Together.  Today is day 4.  Honestly, it's not as hard as I thought it would be; the withdrawals are just like being a little tired or having low blood sugar.  He is having a much harder time - he smoked much more than I did.  My first smoke of the day was never before noon, sometimes not until 5pm if I was super busy at work.  I didn't chain smoke. I was never a pack-a-dayer.  Some days I would go entire days without a cigarette and it wouldn't even cross my mind.

So why am I posting here?  Cause I fucking love cigarettes.  I love them so. Damn. Much.  I love the feel of it in my finger tips and the smell of it in the air.  I love that first click of the lighter and the that first slow drag after a long day at work.  I don't need it every hour or even every day but I want the option to be there.  Do I really have to stop altogether?  Is there anyone else here that was a smoker like me and can tell why I really, truly, absofuckinglutely have to stop smoking?  My resolve is shaking and the only thing keeping me on the wagon is my love for my partner.  I want to quit and yet I don't.

I took all the old cig butts from the ashtray and put them in an an empty pickles jar with a little water.  Every time I think of smoking I pop that lid open and take a big, deep, nauseating breath.  And yet the desire still persists.

What happened to me so far and how i dealt with it.

Well i quit by having bon stop trebor strongmints for about a week to stop that nasty taste coming about, even thou i probly destroyedy teeth with so much sugar, then i went on to smints, this is a major tip to use, always have mints. The first day i had cold sweats but wasnt so bad with the mints, than by day3 onwards i went really dozy and confused due to being high off all this new oxygen, it lasted a few days, i stopped my trebors after week 1, the smints week 2, week 3 nothing just star bursts now and then, oh and i was usually stuffing my gob a lot because of all the new tastes ots really nice, and i got addicted to brushingy teeth gor ages now. Im on week 4 now and my only side effect from the first few days really is gaving a rediculous lack for need of sleep. And my lungs feel stuffy because there sort of nackered and dont really start healing till 12 weeks on, and thats at super slow speed.

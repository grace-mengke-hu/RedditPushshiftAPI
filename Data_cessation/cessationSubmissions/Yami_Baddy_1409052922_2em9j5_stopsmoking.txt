Stopped smoking 5 weeks ago

Hello everyone!

My main motivation behind why I wanted to stop smoking was that I wanted to proof myself that I can do it and not only procrastinate it. The usual "I can stop, if I want to".

So, in the end I was actually able to.

Only the first day was a real struggle for me. After that, it was quite easy. 

The first week went quite smooth. I even felt encouraged to smoke a joint (mixed with tobacco) with my friend on my birthday. No drawbacks, no nothing.

Second week was going fine too. At least I thought so. I started eating way more than I used to when I was smoking.

Starting with the 4th week, I began to start dreaming about giving into smoking a cigarette. I had 5 of those dreams since then. 

I got the feeling my mind/body is trying to get me to smoke again subconsciously.

I really thought I had the greatest struggle behind me, but just realised, it is only beginning.

I am not planning on returning to smoking. But it would help if you guys might have an advice or two to help me through this. (:

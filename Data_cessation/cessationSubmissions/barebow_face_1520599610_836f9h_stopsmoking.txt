7 days free, worried for tonight.

Been a lurker here for a few years, smoked 20 a day for 5 years. Now 7 days free thanks to Allen Carr. Not only was it much easier thanks to the book but migraine free also (unlike previous attempts to quit cold turkey).

My concern is that tonight I am going out with some friends I haven't seen in a while. Drinking will be involved. The only part of the book I've had trouble with is the go out to the social events and enjoy being a non smoker. Prove to yourself you can do things you normally would Do, and enjoy them more as a non smoker.

I feel like it's the fear of me having one too many and losing control of my current mind set and having that "just one cigarette" that doesn't exist.

However on the other end I know if I make it through all night nicotine free then I've done it. The fear will be gone and it will only be easier at each future event.

After typing all this out I don't really know what I'm looking for out of this post.. maybe just to get my thoughts in order? If anyone has experiences of similar situations and any tips/advice on how you made it through that first night out, I'd greatly appreciate it.

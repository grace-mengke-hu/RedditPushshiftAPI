Just hit week 4 cold turkey.....

....and it has been such hard work.

I had been a 20 a day smoker for nearly 23 years.

Week 1 was my worst for cravings, my day 2 and day 4 i was basically bed ridden. The pangs for terrible throughout the rest of the week.

But what no one told me about and which i found harder than the cravings in week 2-3 was the changes my body went through.

My Gums lit up on fire for a good 4 days, so tender to touch, everything hurt them, and i swear they bleed just looking at them in a mirror.

Couldnt sleep

I was so dizzy i swayed down a street one day. 

Stomach bunged up and i forgot where the toilet was on some days.

But.... i feel im over the worst now, we had a bbq at home this weekend, had about 20 people over and half were smoking, i in all honesty had no desire to have a smoke. 


Im not saying i've beaten this fully but as it stands, im very very happy to have just hit 4 weeks, saved Â£300 and not be smoking any more.

and also thanks to everyone here, im a silent reader but it all helps.

Cheers  John

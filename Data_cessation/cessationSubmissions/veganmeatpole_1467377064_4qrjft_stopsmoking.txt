Quit Day 3 - Quitting after finding out some terrible news.

Hi Everyone! I've been lurking for a while but this is my first post.

I've been a pack a day smoker for the past 10 years. I'm on day three with no cigs. I tried to quit cold turkey a couple of weeks ago, but after 48 hours and a trip to the bar, I bought a pack. Now I'm using some leftover nicotine gum from when my dad quit (2mg), and it's really taken the edge off. 

The reason I chose to quit two days ago is because my close friend just found out that her mother has terminal lung cancer. She went from being a normal, healthy woman to finding out she has months to live over the span of three days. I watched my grandmother take her last breaths from lung cancer (she was diagnosed at 50, died at 60). It just really got me thinking, what do cigarettes do for me??

My friend is also two days into quitting smoking - during the most horrible, stressful time in her life. I really want to support her and succeed with quitting.

For the past two days when I crave a cigarette I've been asking myself "How is smoking going to improve my day? Or my life??". That has worked so far, so I'm going to keep on trucking. Soon I'll be a non-smoker and I can't wait :).

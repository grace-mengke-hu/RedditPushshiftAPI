Times up. Lets do thisLEROOOOOY JEEEEENKIINS

Starting today im starting nofap and stopping smoking. I went without smoking 2 weeks with no probs and decided i cud hav 1 cigar. Then bummed half a  cigarette from a friend. Bad idea.

From now on my motto is 'not even one'. dont even pick a quit date. Just decide that TODAY RIGHT NOW is the quit day and take it one day at a time. Fuck all that other shit.

Ok ill update u guys on my progress to help lurkers decide to quit. I always knew id quit cold turkey and be a boss and make it look easy. Stay tuned. Oh yeah gonna start workin out tomoro too. Im gonna be such a badass. ðŸ˜¤

Day 2. My middle game.

I have reset Day 1 more times than I can remember, but today I am Day 2. I know if I can get these first three days down, I will have beat the worst of it. Day 1 I am proud of, the opening game. Day 2 is the middle game. Less charged, since I'm just repeating yesterday. More complicated since I just have to get on with my day. It's the middle game. Tomorrow will be Day 3, end game. 

Just trying to stoke up some good feelings for motivation.

5 days ago I had my last cigarette. Switched to vape.

Hi there. 31/yo pack plus a few a day smoker for 10(ish) years. 

I'm going to have gastric bypass surgery and needed to quit smoking. I bought a vape and a bottle of 12mg nic. But that was too strong. So i bought a bottle of 3mg nic... and that wasnt enough. Ive been mixing. 

The plan is to ween off of nicotine for awhile... and then ween off the vape. 

I'm surprised at how well ive been doing. The vape has been a godsend. I work in a bar 6 nights a week... and cigarettes are EVERYWHERE. i haven't caved. And only had an emotional breakdown once. 

However... everyone keeps scaring me saying that vaping is way more dangerous than cigarettes. Popcorn lung... pneumonia... etc. Etc. Ive looked it up on the google machine... and i cant find sources to tell me if im worse off vaping than smoking. 

I see that many people in this sub use(d) vapes... did any of you get horrible lung issues? Or pneumonia? 

Glad i found this sub! Thanks in advance!

I just had a cigarette.. not because i craved one

I had my MSc results today. 

My father passed away in 2014, his last wish was that i go onto do the MSc. It's completed and I'm so happy with my result. I kept one smoke aside for this occasion as i have avoided visiting his grave for nearly a year now. He'd always go up and visit his mom and have a smoke with her. Today i thought i'd sit and just have one reflecting on his memory.. I've felt so lost in life lately as I now have no further instruction or guidance on what to do with my life.

A pro and a con to this is that
pro - god, they taste fucking awful now. so so so bitter, ugh.
con - I had one and i feel so guilty and angry with myself. 

Just needed to vent really guys, i don't open up to anyone i know and thought i'd just get it off my chest somewhere..

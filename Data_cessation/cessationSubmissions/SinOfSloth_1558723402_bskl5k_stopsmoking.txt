21 y/o — been smoking 6 cigarettes a day for 3 years. I’ve gone 5 days without a smoke but I’ve begun craving one badly the past 2 days. Any tips would be greatly appreciated.

I’m at my parents for a 2 weeks, so I guess it’ll help that I can’t smoke around them. But even so, I’ve been very tempted to drive down to the store and get myself a pack. The first 3 days seemed relatively easy, but god it’s really setting in now. The thought that I’ll never smoke again makes me shudder. Any tips to get through this phase would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!

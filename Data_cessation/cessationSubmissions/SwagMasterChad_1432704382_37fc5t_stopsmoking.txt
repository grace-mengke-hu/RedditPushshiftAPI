Done with this shitty habit

   I'm sixteen, which is pretty young for this sub I guess, but i've been smoking for about two years now. I found it nice to have a cigarette after school to wind down a bit. Then it turned into one after school and maybe another if I felt like it, then one before school, after and so on, until I was up to a half pack to a full pack a day. Long story short, I went to the little convenience store down the street that sells to minors, got a pack, came home, decided that this is one of the worst things I could be doing to myself at my age, and threw it out. It's been about a week and the cravings suck a little, it's not that bad honestly. Definitely glad this sub is around to help me realize how stupid this habit is/was.

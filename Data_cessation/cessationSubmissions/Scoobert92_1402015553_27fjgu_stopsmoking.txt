Day 11! Here are some original quit tips!

Great job if you are quitting or if you have quit. 

1. If you really read the stats a lot of them will freak you out. One out of two smokers will die of a smoking related cause. ***I force myself to watch recordings of anti-smoking ads or those affected speaking about their experience. The foreign (I'm from the US) anti-smoking ads are especially harsh*** Quitting is hard, but not as hard as cancer.

2. Try chewing on whole cinnamon sticks, personally I go for the organic ones.

3. Hot tea and gentle medicines help to ease the quitter's flu, I've been using guaifenesein to clear the mucous. I think this helps keep one on track.

4. Stay stimulated! Either get busy with work or distracted with play. Yoga and deep breathing are good too.

5. Maybe this one is just me, but you could always spend 5 minutes petting your cat or dog while you wait for your craving to subside.

So maybe all this is just me, but you could always try it on and reject what doesn't work for you! I have quit once before for 6 months, but I decided to start up again. Hopefully I am done now and I hope you are too, Good luck!

Browsing for a month. Today makes it one week. Thanks to you all.

I've been wanting to quit for the longest time. I never had the strength. Last weekend, I decided I hated being being shackled down to a fucking stick. I couldn't breathe in deep without feeling pain. Stairs were a nightmare and that doesn't fly when you're a barback at a two story nightclub in the heart of Manhatten. So, I decided to do it and for three days, I puked up black mucous. Disgusting yes, but it's also my toll into the realm of clean lungs. Thank you everyone, really. To anyone trying, bite your lip and jump. I gave the last five years of my life to cigarettes, they gave me nothing in return but pain and wrinkles. You can do it, too!

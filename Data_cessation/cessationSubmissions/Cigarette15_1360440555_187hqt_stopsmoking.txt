Fuck Yeah!

I never in my life thought I would have to overcome smoking cigarettes. I never thought that it would be at age 15 either. But here I am now, not a cigarette in 120 days. I am happier than I have ever been.

The feeling, knowing that I won't waste another penny on smoking, knowing that I won't harm myself, knowing that I have set myself up for a healthier life. It's a wonderful feeling. It's one of those "Fuck Yeah!" Feelings. 

I am happy with the decision I made, and I will stick with it. Just like you all should too. Thank you all for everything you have done. 

The strength you have inside of you will surprise and amaze you, and you can do it.

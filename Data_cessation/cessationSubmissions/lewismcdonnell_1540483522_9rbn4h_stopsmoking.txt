Do you really still believe that stopping smoking is hard? What I have found is interesting

 I have recently joined multiple stop smoking groups to find out how others are coping with becoming a non smoker...

And I shockingly discovered...

That there are people complaining of intense cravings after weeks and some people even months after quitting! 

This confusion must be dispelled.

Yes there is a re-balancing process that the body undergoes as it detoxes and restores optimal balance within the system.

But these long term "cravings" are emotional.

Smoking just like over eating or drinking is the attempt to fill something that seems to be missing.

Until that "something" has been resolved the unrest will remain and if anything the old habit will return or be replaced with something else.

The willpower struggle is a conflict between our conscious desire to stop smoking and our subconscious beliefs and unmet needs.

Examples of subconscious beliefs that my smoking clients have uncovered during our work together are:

"If I am bad I will get the attention of my father and he will love me"

"I hate myself and deserve to be punished"

"I'm not a confident person. I'm awkward and I want to fit in"

"Smoking makes me feel in control and free"

These beliefs are caused by certain experiences in life and we then come to conclusions about life and our self.

You see, without first resolving with these issues we can find ourselves conflicted.

Once these deeper wounds have been healed the inspiration to continue smoking disappears.

This answers another question that I have received:

"Will I gain weight if I stop smoking?"

Weight gain from stopping smoking is a result of replacing one habit with the next in an attempt to fill the same wound. Heal the wound and there will be no issues there.

And it debunks the myth that stopping smoking is hard.

With the correct method it is simply a decision.

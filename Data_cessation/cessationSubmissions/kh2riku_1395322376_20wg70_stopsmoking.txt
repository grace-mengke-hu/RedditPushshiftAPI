On Day 5 of Chantix. Anyone else feel like this ?

Before I begin, Yes I've read all of the horror stories, I know the possible side effects, etc.

I've tried patches, lozenges, gum, welbutrin, cold turkey and e-cigarettes to stop smoking before. The patch+E-Cigarette combo worked pretty well but I was still feeding in to the addiction so I ended up just picking up cigarettes again.

I chose Chantix as a final shot to quitting (after 20+attempts). The first few days were fine. I get a nauseous for a few minutes after taking it which is no big deal and expected. I actually felt more focused on things and my mood was improved. I still feel that way today and don't think that will change. Was getting the same vivid dreams that I did while wearing patches. 
I took my afternoon pill a few hours before going to sleep and started to feel kind of weird, like when you're drunk and a little disoriented, that lasted for about 20 minutes. 
Last night I was only able to sleep for an hour and a half. I had a dream that pretty much encompassed a few of my worst fears. It basically consisted of me being in a very dark house, knowing/seeing someone was in the house hiding (with an intent to harm me, really heavy overtone in the dream) and no matter how hard I tried none of the lights in the house would turn on. I woke up and sat in bed for a few minutes before trying to go back to sleep but couldnt because my thoughts were getting really overwhelming. It felt like 10 people were talking to me at one time, but my thoughts, then after about a half hour it just stopped. Could that just be from the dream ? I feel like I'm getting some weird symptoms for a short period of time then I'm fine for the day. I kind of get really jumpy at night now for any noise. 

I don't want to quit Chantix because I can already feel it starting to work but I don't entirely want to lose this much sleep all the time. Any suggestions/similar reactions ?

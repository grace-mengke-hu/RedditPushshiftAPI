Cigarettes aren't as good as you remember them

I decided to quit 11 days ago, first days it was very hard (biggest problem was I couldn't sleep), then it become so easy I almost forgot about smoking, but in last two days suddenly I couldn't stop thinking about cigarettes. I did not have physical cravings, but just a thought of how cigarettes are nice and how beautiful are the design of cigarette packs I usually used to smoke. Today I had to wait several hours, did not have anything to do and like in autopilot suddenly went to store, bought a pack and smoked one. It was disgusting. I got dizzy and did not enjoy a single puff. Then, after a few hours, I decided to smoke another one, although I didn't have any cravings, just to see how this one feels - I did not feel anything and remembered the reason I quit - you only "enjoy" 5% of cigarettes you smoke, the other 95% are because of addiction. If I could, I would only smoke these 5%, but unfortunately, that is not possible, so I'll try my best to never smoke another one again. Maybe I'll fail, maybe not... but then I'll try again.

And another reason to quit - prices are increased. My usual pack (Philip Morris blue - http://imgur.com/hQQjQTF) used to cost 2,65€, now it costs 2,80€. That is too damn expensive, and it's only question of time when prices will increase even more.

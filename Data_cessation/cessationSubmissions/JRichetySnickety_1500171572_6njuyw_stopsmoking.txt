F'N Cocktails

I quit smoking cigarettes 3-1/2 years ago excluding drinking anything alcoholic i.e. having a glass of wine/bottle of beer/whiskey rocks/vodka soda/margarita/Bloody Mary/old fashioned/white wine spritzer etc.... ðŸ™‚.  The progression after the 3-1/2 years is a nitecap after the kids are asleep 2 times a week with exactly 2 cigarettes on the porch.  (A beautiful end to the evening) + the weekend fun and probably 5 per night Friday - Saturday.  Anyways......  I am now 7 days into zero smokies, quit my two weekly nitecaps and currently trying to enjoy a couple margaritas after the kids go to bed.  The urge to just have a few knowing that I won't lite up in the morning is so tempting, yet I know that I will feel like crap and when I really let it hammer it will be the 1/2 pack - full pack type of night.  I have no idea what I am asking for, I just know that I don't want to smoke because I am tired of being a slave when I have a few cocktails.  However watching Sherlock smoke on TV looks like the tastiest treat I may ever of had!

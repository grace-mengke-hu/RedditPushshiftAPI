I feel the need to put this here. I will not smoke another cigarette after midnight tonight.

I'm 18, been smoking since I was 13. It's hard to breathe, I'm severely hurting my voice (I'm a musician, singing is a big part of my deal..) and I just feel like garbage. For the past couple months I've been feeling a deep resentment towards myself whenever I smoke, I often tell myself after a cigarette stuff like "Why the hell are you smoking? You know it's going against everything your working towards. You are the wall."

I figure, hey, since I obviously know I want to quit, why not make the final step? I feel mentally liberated. 



Wish me luck!

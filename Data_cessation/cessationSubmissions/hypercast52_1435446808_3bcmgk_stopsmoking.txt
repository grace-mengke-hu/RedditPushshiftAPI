Not a smoker, but a friend of one.

Hello reddit! 
                
I am personally not a smoker but my best friend is. He is 18 years old and has been smoking for a few years more than I've known him. I've wanted him to quit since we met but I'm not sure how to go about it.

This issue has been compounded further by the sudden loss of his mother recently. She was a heavy smoker and somewhat of a drinker; died of a heart attack. I don't want to lose my only friend I can actually see before he can become that professor he wants to be.

He says he is getting a vape from his uncle but those require money to sustain, money he simply does not have due to no income whatsoever. I'm terribly afraid he will go back to cigs when the vape is useless.

His stepfather continues to feed him cigs even after his mothers death. It dosn't help that he shrugs anything negitive I bring up about cigs with "oh well" in a "I'm boned and I cant do anything about it but who cares!" voice.

I've had a look through this reddit and I belive you folk can help both me and my best friend. I've never had to help anyone stop an addiction and I don't want to threaten him with his mother. I care for him very much and would like to see him actually get out of this terrible town and do something worthwhile if only for himself.

15 days - hardest day yet

This is the second time I'm quitting. I quit around last March for the majority of 2017 but started again right around the holidays because "it's a vacation and I want to enjoy myself completely."  

I'm just over 15 days without a cigarette right now and the first 14 were manageable. I'm not sure what was different about today?  It almost feels like today was the first time I toyed with the belief that I could have one and only one. 

If it took anything less than walking to the store and buying a whole pack, I very likely would've caved.  

What helps you get past the idea that can you can have just ONE cigarette?

2 weeks. I am weak. I need help

My grandma, my rock, my second mom and best friend died almost a month ago. I live with my best friend but due to fundamental disagreements on how I should be living my life he's kicking me and my son out this weekend. I have couches I can crash on and my son's dad is helping for now. I don't have parents I can rely on, my friends are being as helpful as possible, I can couch surf but they can't take on a kid, I'm going to be asking some of my friends' parents if I can crash at their place the 2 weekends/mo that I have my son.  

I'm at my fucking wits end. I work over 50+ hours a week, parent duty is split 50/50. I've been completely sober of all things for the last 2 months. I spent the entire month before my gram died spending every available moment with her at the cost of everything. I'm so sad. I'm so depressed. My friends and family are being as supportive as possible about me quitting, my friends especially. My fwb is a non smoker so it helps discourage me(seeing him tonight). I'm scared I keep thinking that I just need a binge night. I'm planning on getting shit faced with my friend this weekend (I'm not an alcoholic, been sober cos I've been w/ family) and I keep thinking that a smoking binge that night would be fine but I know it's not and my friends (on/off smokers)  are discouraging the smokes. 

Sorry for the word vomit. I just want to curl into a ball and cry

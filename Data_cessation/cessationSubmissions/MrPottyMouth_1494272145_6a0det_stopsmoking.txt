Help with mental roadblock to quitting smoking

Hey All, just thought I'd throw this in here and seek some assistance.
I need to quit smoking and I am having some trouble with dealing with mental roadblock in starting my path to quitting.
I know that I need to quit.  I know that its bad for me health wise.  I know that I will have a better life without smoking but I just can't seem to get over that mental block in my mind.  
Any help or assistance is greatly appreciated.

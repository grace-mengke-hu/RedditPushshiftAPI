9 months in, feeling low, feeling my will being eroded, open to suggestions/comments

This winter has been somewhat hard on me for a variety of pretty stupid reasons, nothing really too serious, but I've felt a bit down for a few months on end now. The first three months of my quit were hard. I didn't stop feeling regular morning anxiety until I got to the 4th month. At 6 months the cravings came back a bit, but they weren't serious enough for me to even feel a need to ask for help. I posted a shit-ton here the first month, and barely any since then. 

I needed your help to quit then, and I feel like I need help now. I've started thinking about smoking. I've felt the idea to smoke as a real, viable option start to recirculate in the back of my brain. I know it's fucking awful, wrong, and I'll regret it, but in my depressed and low state, it feels like a good 'fuck it' option to maybe distract myself.

I haven't given in. Rather than just try and 'tough it out' again, I figured I'd come back and post. I always promised myself I would post here before choosing to smoke, no matter fucking what. I will not wait until after I choose to smoke to post. So, I'm open to suggestions, criticism, tough love, happy love, advice, rage, encouragement, whatever the fuck. Asking for help from this reddit helped me tremendously in the first month, and I haven't needed to ask for help since... until now.

Anyways. I am making a promise to myself that I will follow through on a reasonable suggestion posted here, as a way of getting myself out of this fucking bad head space. Thanks everyone.

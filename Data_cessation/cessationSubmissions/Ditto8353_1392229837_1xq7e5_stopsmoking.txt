You'll Probably be Seeing a Lot of Me

I had my last cigarette yesterday.

My girlfriend of (nearly) 2 years quit smoking last year, and I've always felt guilty smoking around her since then. I've always worried that I might cause her to start smoking again. But she has always been understanding, and insists that it's okay.

Until she gets her degree, we live a little over 3 hours apart. When I pick her up and drive us back to my place for a weekend, we spend most of that 3 hour drive singing. I can't sing through an entire album with her anymore, and that's what hurts the most. I don't want to lose any time with her because of smoking.

And apparently all of the women in our office in the UK think I sound sexy, so they've started requesting me on support calls, so I've got that going for me.

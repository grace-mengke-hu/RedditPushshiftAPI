My girlfriend is an occasional smoker and I'm not sure how to handle it.

I started smoking when I was just a teenager, was a chain-smoker for three years of my life and quit last November.  I read Alan Carr's book and it really was a moment of catharsis.  I have never touched a cigarette since and never will again. 

However, my girlfriend occasionally smokes and she doesn't think it is a big deal which is probably the worst part. I don't like berating her about her smoking but I feel like it is my responsibility, especially given how much I used to suffer from my smoking and how much I know about how it creeps up on you and you think it's not a big deal and suddenly your a full-blown addict. I tell her my story and she says she's not me which is true but I'm not sure what to do. If I just keep berating her every time she smokes I'm afraid she's just gonna start hiding it from me.

I love her too much to let her do that to herself though but at the same time she's her own person and I can't control her. I'm not sure what to do. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

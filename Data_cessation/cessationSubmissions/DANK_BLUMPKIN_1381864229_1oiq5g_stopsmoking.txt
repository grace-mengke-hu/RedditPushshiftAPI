Finally got me that happy star!!!!

Holy cow I finally made it to the end of my first year!!! what an incredible and empowering feeling! The first month felt slow and was certainly difficult, but after that I almost completely ignored my day counter and the rest of the year flew by!

Now I have replaced my old habit with new activities like going to the gym and riding my bike practically everywhere I go. Now I can do these things without running out of breath abnormally fast too which is an amazing feeling! 

After attempting to quit a bazillion times I finally have broken free from my tobacco shackles and feel truly free! Everyone who is just starting or is well on their way to a tobacco free life should know that it only gets easier and to keep on going just one day at a time! and if you really feel like you are in a tough spot, just talk to someone you know and they will help you get there!

Anyways here's to celebrating the beginning of the rest of our tobacco-less lives!

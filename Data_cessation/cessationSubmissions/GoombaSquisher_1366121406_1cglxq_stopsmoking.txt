Quitting for good

Just gave up after being a smoker for 7 years. I'm dying for a cigarette right now and feeling incredibly weak. It seems like yesterday I tried my first cigarette and here we are, 7 years later and I'm ready to move on. At least I think I am. Right now, the urge is killing me. Just wanted to put that out there. Reading your posts helps take the edge off a bit.

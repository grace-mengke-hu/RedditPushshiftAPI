Having the occasional one

Anyone have any experience with having about one cigarette a week? I feel pretty confident that id be able to sustain it at that level and that it would make everything much easier while still not having a big negative impacT.

I quit about 20 days ago, had a cig about ten days ago. Now Considering having another. It hasn't really been hard at all since then which is why I feel like I would be able to keep it at that level. Thoughts?

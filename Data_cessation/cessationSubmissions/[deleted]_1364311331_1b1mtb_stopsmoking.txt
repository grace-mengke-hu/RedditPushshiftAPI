Anyone else start having some CRAZY dreams after they quit?

I haven't had a cigarette in about a week now. I have started having a lot of really vivid/lucid dreams. Last night I dreamt that I found a corpse on some train tracks, and then took a baseball bat and bashed the head into tiny little pieces causing blood and guts to splatter all over my legs. The spirit of the corpse then possesed me and I lost my own leg somehow. Then I had one of those dreams where you think you are awake. I was in my apartment and got up to get ready for work, and right as I was about to leave the door I woke up again in my bed (for real this time) I dunno. Hopefully, these will go away soon, but it was a bit unnerving.

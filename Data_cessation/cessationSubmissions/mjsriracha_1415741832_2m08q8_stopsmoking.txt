Day 3

So it's day 3 for me. I was really struggling after my first class. First of all, I absolutely despise that class, it's about as exciting as watching paint dry. Second, I hadn't had any coffee this morning and was just super out of it, barely able to hold a conversation with this girl after class. I couldn't stop thinking about how I needed cigarettes, gum, coffee, something. She probably thought I was super weird, but oh well. It's all good because instead of buying a pack, I got some gum and coffee. Drank that shit like my life depended on it. Since then, I've been great. Friend offered me a smoke after my next class, when we always smoke, but I had no difficulty turning him down. I also noticed on my walk home how bad all the cigarettes smell, and how strong the smell really is. It really lingers in the air around where people are smoking. My main concern going forward is that it's this girl I like's 21st this weekend, and she invited me to go drinking with her. I don't want to skip out on it, but if I go I'll get drunk, and my chain-smoking friend who is very generous is definitely going to be there to tempt me. I might just have to tell him ahead of time to not let give me any smokes. Or maybe just hajg out and not drink, I don't know what the right call is. Sorry about the wall of text everyone, just wanted to share where I'm at right now. Day 3 is the farthest I've come in a while. It's also the longest I"ve managed at school, where so many of my friends smoke.

Quiting has made me a nicer person

Quit 3 days ago and im getting mad and frustrated at every little thing, but everytime i do i quickly realize that its because i quit smoking and immediately go out of my way to react in the nicest way possible which is more than i would have done when i was smoking. This has been nothing but fuel to keep on track. I can honestly say i feel happier by doing so.

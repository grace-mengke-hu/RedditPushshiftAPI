Almost done with the 3rd day...

I think physiologically my body doesn't crave the cigarettes anymore, but psychologically it's definitely tough. I loved smoking outside on a cool night with a hot drink, and since it's winter, the weather hasn't been helping. 

Also, I am going to hit the gym later tonight since I've stopped smoking. It has been a pre and post workout ritual for me to take a stog. If I can get in and out of the gym without the temptation to go buy cigarettes from the gas station, it'll be a huge step for me. I think if I really crave a cigarette, I'm going to jump on the treadmill until it goes away. Hope I can do it! you betches are all very inspiring, especially you guys who are quitting with a lot of stressful things going on in your lives. respect.

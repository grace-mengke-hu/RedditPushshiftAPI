Day 15: First 24 hours without Nicotine.

I stopped wearing the Nicoderm patches yesterday.

I need to be free of this ball and chain. Swapping a cig for a patch was a start, but I need to finish it. 

24 hours nicotine free, and I'm doing alright; although I did have a pretty significant urge to slap a coworker earlier today.

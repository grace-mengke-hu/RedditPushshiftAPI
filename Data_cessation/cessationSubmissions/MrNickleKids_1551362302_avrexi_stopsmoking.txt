How to stop smoking?

Hey quitters!

I recently started a youtube channel inspiring people to live their best lives with quick-tip videos. Though I am not a smoker myself, I've been subbed to you guys for a while now because I find you all very inspirational. 

I know smoking is so easy to start, so hard to quit, and that quitting improves your life dramatically. I'd like to make a video inspiring more to quit smoking.

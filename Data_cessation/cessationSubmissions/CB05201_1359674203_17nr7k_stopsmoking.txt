I'm trying to be as supportive as possible helping my gf quit smoking! HELP!

Ok, never being a smoker, I am doing the best I can to support my GF. This will be her first full day without a cigarette. When ever she texts me about how crappy her day is, I try and find quick/temporary solutions to help her through the day. Right now the biggest thing is the shakes. Is this just a physical withdrawal symptom with no real fix for? Also, please leave any comments on how to be over the top with support. Like I said, as someone who has never smoked a cigarette before, I probably won't be able to relate to what she is going through. Please help me support her!

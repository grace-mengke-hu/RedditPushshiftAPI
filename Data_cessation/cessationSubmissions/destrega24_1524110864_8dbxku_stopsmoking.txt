Needed some reassurance

I'm on my 24th day. I've smoked for around 3 years. I had flu like symptoms on the first week. Second week was where everything started.  Extreme anxiety and had some shortness of breath. This shortness of breath happens whenever I'm not busy but it feels like I have to breathe consciously ever since. I don't feel it when I'm occupied with something.

I also feel sad and empty specially after waking up and going to sleep.

 Visited my doctor and had ECG and X-ray done. Everything is perfect according to the doctor. The worst thing is I think I've become a hypochondria maniac and every symptom I get makes me feel like it's a bizarre disease and I keep on searching the internet about diseases. Ughhhh. Makes me want to go back smoking.

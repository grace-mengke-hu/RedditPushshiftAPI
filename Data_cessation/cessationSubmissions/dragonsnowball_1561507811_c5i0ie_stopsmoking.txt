Day 6

Feeling good. This is my 3rd and final quit. I'm halfway through Alan Carr's book. I thought I could go without the nicotine lozenges but I'm not quite to that point yet. Working up to it though. Been doing a lot of meditation, yoga, and working out. Trying to stay busy. Feels good to be almost a week into my new life as a nonsmoker!

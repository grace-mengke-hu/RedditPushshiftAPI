Quit smoking four months ago and I'm unhappy about it. I miss smoking every day and often wish for a cigarette. Anyone else going through something similar?

Just want confirmation I'm not alone. I'm 4 months and 3 days nicotine free and I hate it. I miss smoking so much. I miss the taste, the smell, the feeling I'm my throat and lungs. My cravings have actually been worse the last month than they were the first month. I keep thinking about picking up vaping. Anyone else go through something like this?

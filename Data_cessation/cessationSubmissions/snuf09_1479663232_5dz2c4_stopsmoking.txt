Day 6 - I did it! Motivation is all time high now :)

I'm so stoked, I actually managed to party and get drunk without having a single puff! I had an absolute blast and I was still able to stand outside with my friends that smoke without any trouble.
I really feel like this is going to work! Thanks a lot for the support and help!

Quitting in the Military

I've been wanting to quit for a couple years now, and failed many times as well.  I'm sitting at the Base of Mt. Fuji, living out of tents, and freezing my bum off.  I have nothing but time on my hands, full of boredom, followed by a whole lot of organized chaos. So far I'm doing good, the cravings are there, I wish I could tell others to lay off and give me some space otherwise I'm going to resort to smoking...that's what I would have done when I was younger.  I realized something this time around though, nobody really cares about your smoking habits at work, nor do those at home a lot of the time, as long as you're taking care of your business, I'm not saying no one does as that's why we're here.  And I know this is probably common knowledge but I figured it out and I am now quitting for myself.  So with the cravings come my thought process of, "I'm doing this for myself, and that what I care about, not what others think."

So the best advice I can give is, do it for yourself!

New Years resolution quitting, Jan 2nd @ 1000 was the last cigarette.

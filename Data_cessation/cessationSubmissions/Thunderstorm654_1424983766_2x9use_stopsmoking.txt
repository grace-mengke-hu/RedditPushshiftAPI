Two years! (I don't remember the exact date)

Maybe I shouldn't be posting here, because I was never really a heavy smoker. It started back in 2009 when I landed a job in which the majority of the people there were smokers. Before that, I bummed cigarettes from my smoker friends when I was drinking but never inhaled. When I started that job, I picked up a pretty healthy habit. Not real heavy, maybe a pack every two days. 

After I was fired from that job, money was tight so I was sort of forced to stop smoking whether I wanted to or not. 

I got another job and started smoking on and off for a few years. Then in February of 2013, I bought a pack of cigarettes after a period of not smoking. I lit the cigarette and for whatever reason this overwhelming feeling of "I don't want to do this anymore" came over me. I didn't even finish the cigarette I was smoking. I put it out and threw away the rest of the pack and haven't had a craving since then.

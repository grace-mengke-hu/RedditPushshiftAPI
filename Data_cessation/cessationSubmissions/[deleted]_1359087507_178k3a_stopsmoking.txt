Almost 24 hours...

I've been cutting back for weeks and last night I finally decided to sever all ties with cigarettes. It feels good and awful all at the same time. I've been wanting to quit for a lot of reasons. Some of them are obvious like the insane health risks associated with smoking. Some of them are more superficial but just as important to me. I am also prone to horrible anxiety and smoking only worsens my anxiety. I live a pretty healthy lifestyle otherwise (well, I could exercise more, but one thing at a time) and it doesn't even make sense for me to keep up this filthy habit. I have been smoking since I was young, about 14, and I became a "real" smoker around 16 or 17. I've been smoking about a pack a day for 14 years. 

I have been reading a lot of your posts and I just wanted to say hello and introduce myself here. I think this is a great subreddit and I look forward to helping others as much as I'm sure others will help me.

Also, I would like to say after almost 24 hours of not smoking how damn good I smell! I'm going to try and hold on to and remember these little things to keep me going. 


As a side note I would like to offer up any help for anyone who might be dealing with a lot of anxiety as a result of quitting. I have horrible anxiety as it is and I have a lot of helpful techniques for people struggling with anxiety. I suppose it's sort of my unprofessional specialty. 

My quit plan (doctor recommended) is to quit the cigarettes completely and use the patch to taper down. I know some people might see this as cheating or delaying the process but me and my doctor both agreed that such a shock to my system of going nicotine free would be a bad idea. I went about 15 hours without a patch and I almost ripped off 2 innocent peoples heads and couldn't concentrate to the point of not being able to see straight so I decided to give the patch a go. It has taken the edge off and even allowed me to get a post class nap in.  

I wrote a list of reasons I wanted to quit earlier and I figured I would share them with you all in case anyone is looking for some more reasons to help them out in their struggle:

* my health
* my teeth
* my skin
* my hair
* the way I smell
* the way my house & clothing smell
* to be free of the NEED
* to not freeze my ass off in the winter
* the health of my pets (sometimes I would sneak one indoors)
* to be a good example for my nieces and nephews 
* to make my folks proud who have lost a good friend to lung cancer
* to feel better
* to look better
* to not have the guilt anymore
* to be able to play with my friends kids without worrying about passing on second hand toxic crap
* to not be the person who stinks in class or at work
* to be able to keep my new car clean and not looking out hazy windows
* to feel good about myself
* to feel a sense of accomplishment
* to say "screw you" to tobacco companies
* to be able to get more active without wanting to hack up a lung
* to finally round out my healthy lifestyle
* to make dating easier  (dating non-smokers before always made me feel AWFUL to the point that I almost avoided them)
* $$$$$$$
* to help with my anxiety

Was clean for 10 months but caved in :(

Survived clean for 10 months but gave in a moment of weakness. In past four months, I have smoked 1-2 cigarettes every couple of weeks or so. Typically on days of high stress at work. 

Every cigarette after a break of couple of weeks feels even better now! 

Starting my third try at quitting today. Hope I am stronger this time!

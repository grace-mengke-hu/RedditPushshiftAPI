On Kissing Smokers, Relapsing, and the Nature of Things

**Introduction**

First of all, thank you all very much.  While I haven't always been trying to stop -- I have been a part of this community for a good, long time now.

**Back Story**

This is my second quit.  First was three years ago.  I quit for approx. 18 months.  Then I met ... her.  She's awesome - but smokes.  The first time I kissed her, I remember thinking, 'Hmmm ... what is that exotic taste?  Oh yeah, that's cigarettes.'  It wasn't long before I was back at it.  So -- fast forward about a year to the present day.

**Our Hero**

We're still together but she's been away for about a month.  During that time, I quit smoking.  I really didn't 'mean to.'  I just woke up one day and decided that I didn't feel like it anymore.  It's been a little more than two weeks now AND I FEEL GREAT!  I've barely had a craving - not even while drunk.

**The Conflict**

So she comes back on Wednesday.  We've talked about it and I hope that she'll join me in the Quit.  She's not certain about it yet, though.  So keep me in your thoughts, friends, because a big, smoky kiss is right around the corner -- and I don't want it to lure me back in!

**TL; DR**

I'm nervous about an upcoming make-out session with a smoker.

I want to quit!

I switched to vaping about a year ago and have gotten all the way down to 3mg. Problem is I feel like I’m glued to the thing and I’m tired of it. 

I’ve gone without for about 12 hours and it’s awful. Should I try going to 0mg or just go for complete cold turkey? 

My husband smokes cigarettes and he’s planning on quitting next week. I feel like we should both quit but I’m a little nervous- he’s on at least a pack a day and I don’t know if we should quit at the same time since we will both be at a minimum, crabby as hell. 

Any thoughts or suggestions?

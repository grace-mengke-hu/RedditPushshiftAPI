Leafing through the thread, I noticed something

There is a total lack of harden the fuck up. Down vote me if you must but on some level you people must know that in the fundamental sense it comes down to not buying a pack, not fishing for a lighter, not smoking. I'm 29 I've tried to quit a bunch of times but really this has been the only thing that's kept me clean. I'm done with this shit and and so should you be.

Stop. Smoking. Just like that. Use your patches or your whatever else (I strongly disgaree with e-cigs, it just prolongs what you need to do) and for fucks sake quit. None of this "diary" shit. None of these "I caved, what do I do now" pleas for attention. 

Three days. It's true. Three days and you're good. So do that and you're on the way. The danger of these 'support' groups is that they become a crutch to recidivism. Stop smoking or don't. Up to you. But none of this half ass shit. Just take a drink of water when you feel the craving, turn to your hobbies and stop being slaves to the habit.

Sorry I just needed to rant a little. I'm on your side.

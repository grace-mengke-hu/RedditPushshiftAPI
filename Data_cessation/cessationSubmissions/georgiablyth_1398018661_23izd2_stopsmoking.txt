Get's worse as time goes on?

Hello!

I used to smoke about 4-5 cigarettes a day (I'm 16). I have quit in the past to around the 4 week mark on multiple occasions but have given in due to an increase in cravings at this time.

This time, first week was hell, then I found it fairly easy between week 2 and week 4, but it's getting harder this week (by that, I mean a shitload more cravings/anxiety).

Does it get easier and if so, when?

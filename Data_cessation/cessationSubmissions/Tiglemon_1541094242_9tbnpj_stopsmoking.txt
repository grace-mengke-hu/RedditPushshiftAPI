3rd and final time this year. Im done.

First 2 months quit , then 2 weeks. I'm done. I have made up my mind I'm done. 

I want to enter the new year with a few months on me.  

I don't want another year on my birthday as a smoker. 

Oh ya, on an other note. Im doing IF to keep my weight in check and been actively exercising past few months. (Got back to workout slowly after an injury early this year) I feel great and I didn't smoke today.

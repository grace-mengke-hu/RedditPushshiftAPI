Warmer weather means outside hang outs, roof decks, long walks, stoop beers, driving with the windows down aaaaaaand

all the other things I remember doing with a cigarette between my fingers. Last night was a serious challenge, all of my friends that I hung out with yesterday smoke and we were on a roof deck. I'm proud of myself, but I do continue to get this twinge of anxiety looking forward to my summer because that trusty old friend won't be there with me for it.

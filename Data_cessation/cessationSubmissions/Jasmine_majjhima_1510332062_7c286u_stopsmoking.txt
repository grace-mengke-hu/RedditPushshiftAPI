Is Allen Carr's 'The only way to stop smoking permanently' really badly written or is it just me.

So as the title suggests I'm reading Carr's 'Only way...'. And I'm embarrassed to admit that I'm having difficulties with it, I'm half way through and he keeps losing me, I can forgive him for taking the opportunity to express Allen's world view sometimes but it's starting to seem too much that that gist of his argument gets lost and jumbled at times I'm having a hard time pulling out the threads. It may be just me, I'm happy to admit to that but it seems to me in order to reinforce his point from 'Easyway' he's added so much to lend it credibility that it's lost much of its power. Has anyone else had problems with this?

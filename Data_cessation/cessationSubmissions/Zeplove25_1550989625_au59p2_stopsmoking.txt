Day 5. Im most surprised by the mind games, but I think this is really it.

I have quit a few times before, but always with the same fundamental reason: “I know I should.”   Based solely on will power, id always cave. This time its different. At 30, I dont want to be a smoker anymore. I dont want to smell like smoke. I dont want to purposely remove my coat before getting on an elevator at work, or purposely stand five feet away from people because im ashamed. I dont want to wheeze when I lay down, and I dont want to have that nasty cigarette taste in my mouth that even toothpaste does not remove. 

Today is day 5, cold turkey. I actually thought my physical cravings would be worse. Those are subtle. The biggest challenge has been fighting against the voice. The one that acts super chill and non-chalant and is like “really though, do you need to quit right now? Youre doing fine.. you could quit whenever.” Or, “youre only quitting because of reason 1,2,3. If that changed, then you could just smoke.” 

What is this demonic shit, and where is the simple irritability i was promised??

Never Felt worse since I quit smoking, am I alone?

I have been cold turkey from cigarettes and trees for over a month [smoked for almost 12 years], to be honest I have never felt worse in my life. I thought I was just withdrawing etc. But I have no cravings or anything anymore. I cant sleep, stress is soo bad I have been put on anxiety meds, stomach is always upset, etc. Everything feels bad all the time. Been to the doctor a lot recently as well [having swelling in 4 ribs that they cant explain] and brought up everything and they donno. Did anyone else have long term bad affects from quitting? 

I'm never gonna smoke again and I know smoking is never a good thing,so no chance of starting again. But everyone is always OMG I feel soooo great!!!! etc. I feel horrible and just wanted to see if it was just me or not >.<

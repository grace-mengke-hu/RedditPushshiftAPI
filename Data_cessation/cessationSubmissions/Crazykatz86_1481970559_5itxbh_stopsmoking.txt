Annoyed

So it's day six of my quit.  Have been having some ups and downs.  I'm at work and one of the people that I worked with returned contaminated equipment to me without telling me.  Hence exposing me to said contamination.  I am beyond furious! I am trying to breathe and take my mind off of it but a cigarette sounds really good right now.

Will I always miss it?

I'm 5 days in, I've been using nicotine microtabs and lozenges to help with the sweating and headaches. But this doesn't help my brain going into overload when I see someone smoking, I get lost in my imagination thinking about how much I liked it and how it made me feel, and then the craving comes rushing back. Will it always be this way? How can I trick myself into believing I don't like it? This is a lot harder than I thought it would be.

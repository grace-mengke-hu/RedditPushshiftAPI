I am a non smoker!!

After 2 years of attempting to quit on and off. I have finally succeeded. I extinguished my final cigarette not 20 mins ago, while finished the last pages of Alan Carr's The Easy Way To Stop Smoking. I read it slowly over the span of several weeks.

No more nightmares from lack of oxygen. 

No more starting my day with a severe asthma attack and coughing up copious amounts of phlegm.

No more yellowing my teeth, grey pallor, destroying my health, and playing with fire as an HIV positive individual.

No more taking unhealthy amounts of asthma medication daily.

No more chest and lung pains, headaches, heart palpitations, hair loss, and blood pressure issues due to smoking.

No more guilt for smoking around my pets and other innocents like children.

No more stinky clothes and car.

No more lighting money on fire.

No more apologizing to non smokers and doctors.

There is nothing to lose and everything to gain. Something I love from Carr's book is the analogies of smoking being akin to wearing tight shoes just to experience the relief of removing them occasionally, and the "glass half full/empty" scenario where the delusional smoker sees a full glass when it is totally empty. His book helped me to deconstruct the brainwashing, which I agree is the only reason smokers continue to smoke.

Everyone is capable of becoming a non smoker! Keep trying, no harm comes from trying.

Woohoo! 6 months!

I can't facebook this cuz my family is on facebook and can't see this, so I figure this is a good place for this...6 months without smoking!  Yay me!

This is probably the 6th time I seriously tried to quit in the last 10 years and this is definitely the longest I've gone without smoking during this time.  And for the first time, I feel like I've really quit for good.

For those of you who just started or are having a bad time, let me encourage you by telling you that you really do get to a point where you don't think about it all the time.  I'm not going to lie, I still think about it every now and then, but I'm finally at the point when I respond to those urges by saying, "eh, I just feel too good about myself for not smoking."

Remember, quitting is hard!  And you're doing a great job by just trying.  Don't get caught up with numbers and stuff.  The 3 month anniversary and the 6 month, and hopefully for me, the year anniversary will just come naturally.  Don't worry about quitting long term and just do your best to not have a cigarette today.  I promise, these days will eventually begin to add up faster and faster.

Anyways, feel free to leave me notes of encouragement, but what I really want you to do is feel good about yourself because you're trying to quit.  Have a great day everyone!

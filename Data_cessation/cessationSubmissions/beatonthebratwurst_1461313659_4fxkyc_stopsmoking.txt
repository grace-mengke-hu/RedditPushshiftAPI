Climbing the walls on day five.

So it's day five of my umpteenth attempt at quitting. I'm through the nightmare that is the first three days and settling into the grind of still craving whilst no longer feeling the novelty of "woo, I've quit smoking, look at me go."

I have nothing further to offer, just posting this small vent to keep myself from running down to the bottle-o for beers and ciggies.

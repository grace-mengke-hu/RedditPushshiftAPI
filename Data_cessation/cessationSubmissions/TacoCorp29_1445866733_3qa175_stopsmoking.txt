After 14 years, I want to quit. Any helpful attitude/psychological adjustments welcome!

I started smoking when I was 17; I'm 31 now.  I chain smoke like cigarettes are going out of style, and I'm tired of being out of breath after walking up only 1 flight of stairs to my apartment.  I have also become, in the last year or so, a total alcoholic.  I think quitting smoking will help with quitting drinking, and vice versa.  Feel free to drop any words of wisdom, advice, and/or motivation my way.  I'm going to need all I can get.  Cheers!

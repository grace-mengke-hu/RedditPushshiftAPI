3 months without nicotine and still have cravings. Do they go away?

I never smoked cigarettes however I chain smoked a vape for about a year. From 3 mg of nicotine to 50 for a while. I got super sick for 3 weeks and decided I shouldn't be doing this since I have asthma. I quit cold Turkey when I was on 20 mg. I used nicotine to self medicate which is why I took up the habit. It's been 3 months and I'm still dying to start back up again. I've been looking into the patch and the gum but I'm afraid that it would make me relapse back into it. Do these cravings go away for everyone? If so how long do I have to wait? I feel like any minor stressful situation I just want to go back to it.

Thanks

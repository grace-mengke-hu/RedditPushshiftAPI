6 months down, and now a true test of will.

I quit last october. Using the vape and loving it (say what you will, its working for me). I got motivated to quit when I was applying for jobs last summer and saw that most of the jobs were asking for non smokers (architectural drafting). last week i landed a job in an office full of smokers, and they chain smoke in the office. Its a private company in a building they own, so legally they can do as they please. 

This has been a great test of will. Never have i hated smoking so much. I hate the smell on my clothes and the taste of ash on my breath after a day of work. Its still my 1st week, so im going to wait till next week to ask to move my work station to somewhere more secluded. 

I was a pack a day for 11 years. 6 months down and I can say with confidence that im done with ciggerettes. I wish you all the best of luck and hope my story brings some of you confidence.

Tldr: 6 months quit. Got a job in an office where everyone smokes in the ofice, hate smoking more than ever.

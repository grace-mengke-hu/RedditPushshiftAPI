Really bad cravings after a month since quitting

It's day 36 that I haven't smoked. Days went by without much difficulty that led me to wonder why is this hardest thing to do as many people say. For about 30 days it was all good and I was really happy.

Around 31st day or so everything changed. I was going through some personal problem at the same time. Real bad cravings that never ceased to this day. The problems have been resolved but the urge to smoke hasn't. I don't know how long I can take this.

Has anyone else experienced this?

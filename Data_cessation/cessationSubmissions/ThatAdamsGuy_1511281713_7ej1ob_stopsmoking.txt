Turns out running out of money works wonders for not smoking.

So overspent a little on my carefully budgeted month so far when going back home to visit my fiancée (I'm currently 200 miles away on a year-long internship). Last cigarette smokes was Sunday night, and I have £15 til the end of the month. Hoping that by the time I get paid I won't have as strong an urge to smoke, and can fight it better.

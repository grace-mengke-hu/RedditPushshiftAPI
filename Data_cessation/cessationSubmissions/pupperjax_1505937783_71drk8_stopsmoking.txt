60 days

I didn't think I'd get here... but here I am with 60 days behind me without having picked up a single cigarette (except in my dreams, which I've been told is very normal... however I still wake up feeling guilty!) Feeling physically and emotionally GREAT. One minute at a time, one lung full of breathe at a time, one step at a time, they all add up. After 12 years of smoking, I didn't realize the literal weight that cigarettes were having on my life. It seriously dragged down every part of me, but I had become so used to it that it was the norm. I pray I don't relapse, because the pervasive depression I was living in while smoking is NOT WORTH IT. Thanks for reading this, if you took the time. If not that's fine too because I'M STILL NOT SMOKING!! :)

How do I continue to stick to quitting

I have some time off right now which I am using to my advantage to quit. It's been 4 days since, we have a plan to go drinking in another 2, I'm scared I might relapse then. Also, I'm going back to college in another 11 days and all my friends smoke, literally everyone. How can I continue to not smoke when everyone is smoking around me and I know for a fact won't be as supportive in me quitting?

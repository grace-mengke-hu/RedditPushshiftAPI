Today is day 100 smoke free. Not what I expected ...

Smoked about a pack a day for 23 years.  Been 100 days as title says and I'm pretty proud of that, but I'm really not getting the benefits I thought I would.  Definitely breathing easier and not getting winded (wasn't ever much of a problem to begin with though) and that annoying cough is gone, which is the best part.

But the kicker is I just have absolutely no energy.  Like none, like I am I just completely tapped out.  Is this common?  What did you guys do about it?

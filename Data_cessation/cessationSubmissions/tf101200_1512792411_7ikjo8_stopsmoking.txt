What got me through the quit

It's day 40 now. I can't believe I've made it to this point. I had tried quitting many, many times and never made it more than 4-5 days before I weakly caved. I just wanted to share what helped me get to where I am now.

1) I got an e-cigarette. I had always tried quitting cold turkey and it was always a failure. I have used the e-cigarette since the day I quit and it was SOO much easier. I have tapered down to 0mg nicotine juice and plan on ditching it completely in the next week.

2) Exercise. Cigarettes had me to a point of absolutely no exercise and walking up my one flight of stairs would get me out of breath (I'm only 25..) I went for a run a few days after I quit and felt absolutely amazing and I haven't stopped.

3) Remove yourself from other smokers for the first week or two. I have two roommates who both smoked. When I quit I actually convinced them to get the same e-cigarette and they are now on day 39 as well. I noticed I always caved because I wouldn't resist when I was around them when they were smoking.

Guys. If I can do it, so can you! Stay strong and make sure you have a plan around your quit. I believe in you and can attest that you will feel exponentially better just days after you quit. Love y'all and stay strong.

Last week.

I tried quitting twice, cold turkey, last week. I couldn't make it past the 26 hours mark.
So I'm back smoking, but less, and more aware. problem is - this has taken a huge toll on my mental health. I suffer from general anxiety disorder and depression, which were well treated with zoloft up until this week. the smoking cessation attempts has led me into a plethora of mental effects, some of them "easy" - agitation, nervousness, confusion, and some of them terrible - acute anxiety and depression. bad depression. first time in years I have actual suicidal thoughts. 

I'm teriffied and confused by this feeling. Even in the darkest hours of depression and anxiety I have never, EVER, thought about killing myself. could it be that i will need psychological help for this journey? maybe I need to re-adjust my meds? did anyone else here suffer from mental disorders, and quit smoking?

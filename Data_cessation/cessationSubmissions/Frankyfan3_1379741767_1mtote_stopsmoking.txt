Sensory deprivation / floating can help you quit?

I recently got a Groupon deal for a place that offers floating in sensory deprivation pods. While researching the practice I found claims that it can be helpful with smoking cessation. (And weight loss, & pain relief, & a long list of unbelievable claims of fixing all the things.)

I tried it the once, & if only for just the forced relaxation/mediation time plan to do it again.

I am wondering if any of you have experience with this & if you found it helpful for your quit, or even in general. Thanks!

PS: I used to have a smoke right after trips to the lady spa & hate myself so hard for poisoning myself  immediately after spending money & time to detox & improve my health.

Leaving the floating place I was super relieved to not have that urge (I had already quit about 2 weeks prior, cold turkey.) Thanks in part to you guys!

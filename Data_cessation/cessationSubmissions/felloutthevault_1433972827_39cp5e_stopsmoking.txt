Only been four hours into cold turkey

My heads racing between how just one can't hurt, that I can just begin to cut back, and also how bad I suddenly want to pick up rock climbing as a hobby. 20 minutes left at work, I can't remember the last time I went for more than 2 hours without a smoke at work. Years, without a doubt. I'm going to make it this time. I've gone whole evenings without cigarettes before when I was sick. I don't have to work tomorrow or Friday. I can do this. I haven't even told my partner that I'm trying to quit cold turkey yet. I wonder if she'll take it seriously. It doesn't matter. I need to to stop, for myself, for my son, to have a good nights rest again, to feel the bottom of my lungs when I breathe again, to not get winded from a flight of stairs. It's going to be hard, but I can do this.

1 Month HOLY F'ING SHIT

I made it a fucking month without a cigarette, without committing murder or getting checked into a mental institution.
This sub has been such a huge help. 

It's actually been sort of easy. I'm just SO DONE. 
So here's to 30 more. 
FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK you cigarettes! (and nicotine) 

To anyone struggling- you've literally got this. Fuck cigarettes, they smell like shit. They're a burden in every single sense of the word.

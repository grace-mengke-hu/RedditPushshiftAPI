Day 1 of No Cigarettes

I smoked my last cigarette yesterday, February 15th, 2016 at 3:30am. I had 11 cigarettes left in my pack when I was on my way to work. I had just finished my pre-work cigarette; the entire time I smoked it I was thinking about quitting. I've "quit" before, and failed. I've never been somebody whose smoked continuously in their life, its mostly been binge periods during times where I'm particularly stressed and then I set it down for a few months before coming back. This past month I'd "set it down" 3 times before the urge to buy another pack set in. Smoking that last cigarette made me realize that if I keep doing this, it's going to become more than just a binge habit, and I don't want that or need it. In a moment of willpower I threw my pack out the window of my truck. Not the most environmentally friendly method of disposing my last, but I couldn't bear to have them in my sight anymore.



On my drive to work this morning, it was raining. I felt the urge to smoke but the rain soothes me in a way that nicotine never could, and I was at peace. I think it was a sign. I almost told myself "I'll finish this pack and I'm done." As I type this I have the urge to smoke. I probably think about cigarettes at least once an hour. I think if I had kept that pack my willpower to stop smoking would have faltered. 

I finish my undergraduate studies this May; my first goal is to not smoke another cigarette before I graduate. From there I'll up that goal, but I figure working towards small goals repeatedly is easier than one long term one. 

I'm not really sure how to end this. I just wanted to get this written down somewhere and I figured this subreddit was the best place to record my thoughts and get help.

While I'm here I guess I should ask; does anybody have any solid destressing methods they use in place of smoking?

2 Weeks of being Nicotine Free: Cravings aren't appearing every day and my energy is gradually coming back.

I am so grateful to be completely away from American Spirts and nicotine gum for two weeks. I did develop some minor bad habits of binge-watching Netflix and eating crappy foods at the end of my first week -- which I blame for causing some anxiety and depression around this time. Thankfully, that started decreasing at the beginning of my second week. Now I see myself starting school, practicing better health habits, and reminding myself every day that I can't ever have any intake of nicotine. I hope everyone is doing well on their journey to a better life. Peace!

[Update] Passing the week milestone, with a little help from my friends.

A couple weeks ago I had made a post about wanting to quit, about being broke and the days of of choosing to smoke instead of eat [(original post)](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/1c5kuy/well_its_gotten_to_the_point_where_im_forced_to/).  I had progressed to a pack a day, with 5 years or so of smoking (17-22).  I had my last cigarette on Sunday, April 21st, it's been a week and I feel like hell, but mentally I know it's good.  My friends knew I wanted to quit and give me the motivation to do so.  I have a hard time wanting to quit for myself, but having other people show concern and try and help me motivates me to stop.  

Smoking was selfish of me, and I do not view myself as a selfish person.  I was robbing my friends and family time to spend with me, even if that would be down the line in my life.  Cigarettes killing me slowly was something I knew was happening, and didn't really care about.   At this point it doesn't really matter much how I am viewing myself, but how other's view me.  People turn to me to be that rock in their life, the immovable boulder that will always be there for them to lean on.  People will always need me, and I need to be around for them.  

Smoking was a crutch, a weakness that I had the power to fix, so I decided to do just that.  I know I do not want to smoke, despite what my mind may trick me into thinking.  I'm a strong believer that the most challenging aspect of life is mastering your own mind, and when you can conquer your own mind's negativity, you can accomplish anything.  Thank you for reading, and remember that you all have people that love and care about you, even if it's people you don't know or haven't met.

Had a dream was smoking

So I had a dream that I was smoking a cigarette but I was completely disappointed and pissed off that I did. I wonder if this is my body subconsciously saying, "hey asshole, this is how you gonna feel if you do this shit in the real world." Or if it is playing games with me trying to get me to smoke again.

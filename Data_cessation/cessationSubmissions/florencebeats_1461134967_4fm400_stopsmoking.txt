Being the "cool guy" smoker

So, I'm a couple weeks off cigarettes. I've failed quitting many times this year alone and I'm trying to make it through this time around. The physical addiction isn't too tough for me. Yeah, I'm irate the first couple days but that fades. What I really struggle with is - as dumb as it sounds - fighting off a craving when I want to look "cool". It sounds like a bad joke, but it's true. I've smoked since 16 and it's become a part of my identity. I'm used to having a few drinks at the bar then sulking outside to have a smoke with a scowl on my face, showing the world that I'm a cool dood going through some ruff times (oh GOD, this sounds so lame now that I'm writing it out). On top of that, I'm a bit of a romantic so I cant help but want a cigarette during a scenic view, during a really moody song, or anything that brings back that warm nostalgic feeling.

Anyone else have this problem?

I don't remember smoking. That was some evil parallel universe.

Tomorrow is 50 days. Honestly, I barely remember smoking. This is so doable, friends.

I smoked in some evil parallel universe. I grew up in a house where my dad and four of my siblings smoked. I smoked for twenty fricking years, stopping soon after my kids were born, but then stupidly resuming for another five years after they left home. 

Or did I? I don't remember. It was just some evil parallel universe.

It's so good to breathe. 50 days of freedom. And I turn 50 this year. Thank gawd I escaped. You can too.

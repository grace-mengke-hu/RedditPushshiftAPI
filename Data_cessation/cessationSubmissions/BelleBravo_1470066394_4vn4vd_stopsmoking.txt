3,297 cigarettes not smoked

Over $900 saved, clothes smell clean all the time, no standing out in the extreme heat or in the rain just to smoke, no more wheezing as I lay down in the bed and being able to recover my breath easier after running up the stairs at the metro station. I'm happy I made it this far, through the ups and downs. Thank you everyone who has been here to help calm me down through cravings and breakdowns, thank you to me for making better decisions for myself and thank you to the person special who helped me stay occupied the first day a year ago I decided to quit.

Over a year and still struggling.

I used Allen Carr's book to quit cold turkey. I read it three times. I almost felt successful. I live in a foreign country now. My job is harder than it's ever been. I wish I could smoke almost every single day. I think it will relax me and help me deal with my stress. I know that it won't relax me overall, but at least it will give me a little control over my moods. It's been a year and four months. I feel like I can smoke for a while and then quit again. I'm running out of will power. I know Carr doesn't believe in the will power method, but I want them and I can't make myself stop wanting them. Maybe if I smoke again for a while I will remember how unsatisfying they are.

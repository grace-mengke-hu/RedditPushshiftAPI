MADE IT THREE WEEKS IM A GOLDEN GOD!!!!!

Did I cancel all social plans this weekend because I was super cranky? Yes. But I did drink wine with my husband and watch many of the Missions Impossible, and next weekend I will be back in the social swing and ready to get a month under my belt. 

Thank you so much to this community-- it's incredibly helpful to have a place online available to commiserate and strategize with other new non-smokers.

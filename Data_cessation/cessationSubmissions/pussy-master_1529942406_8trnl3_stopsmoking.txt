Last pack mentality

I've always told my self it would be my last pack or my last cigarette. I give my self that nod, "yep, this will be my last one"', almost like an excuse.

I'm trying to stop that, next time you tell yourself that just pause for a minute and ask yourself, "will this really be my last".

Maybe just wait 5 minutes.

Quitting is easy, its not starting up again that's hard.

My my 2 cents.

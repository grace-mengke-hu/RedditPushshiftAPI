Stopping Today

I just finished reading Allen Carr's Easyway To Stop Smoking book tonight and I feel really motivated to never put another cig in my mouth again. I'm excited about all the things I stand to gain from stopping and although I didn't think it was possible, I'm actually looking forward to waking up tomorrow and taking on the day without smoking. I hope I don't feel differently in 24 hours, but this sub and its stories and encouraging comments have already been so helpful in my decision to take action and buy that book. It's a step. After 9.5 years a slave, I'm ready to break the chain.

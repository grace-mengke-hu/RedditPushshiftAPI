4th day

7/31/2017 was my last day as a smoker. I cheated and decided to use NRT. I think cold turkey is best, for the simple fact that I am weening myself off the nicotine and delaying the withdrawal further - but it is what it is. This early in my journey - I am at a constant mind game/battle. 

It helps me, although it seems silly to type out here, I am just going to share how I stop my addict brain's rationalizations.

I say to myself, or out loud if able:
I am a non-smoker
I am strong
Mope not, rejoice
I am doing this
I am successful 
I am beating my addiction one day at a time.

I am looking at this as a game, between my addict mind and the rest of my brain. I can do anything I set my mind to, I am going to do what I set my mind to. 

I know that as time goes on, and I finally ween myself completely off the NRT - that it will be easier, and not such a constant battle - for now I will argue day in and day out with myself if I have to, and that's just how it is. 

This is so much easier with the right mind set!.

Best wishes to you all - any further advice or kind motivation is welcomed.

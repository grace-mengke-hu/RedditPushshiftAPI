Wanting to quit..partially

Just to start I'll give a bit of history.   Started smoking when I was 18, 21 now. Been smoking close to a pack a day pretty much everyday since. Getting to the point where I just want to stop smoking for the sole reason that I am addicted.   I enjoy smoking. I love cigarettes and cigars and don't want to go my life without smoking either one again. I just want to break my addiction.    So I'm looking for some tips. I'm going to start quitting this sunday when I go to visit my SO for a few days and figure that will get me at least three days in. It's getting past day 4 that I struggle with.

Relapsed, hate it, blah. Trying to get back on the wagon.

Hi ya'll. 
I was goin' strong for a minute there (few weeks), and posting a lot here at first.
Life stuff majorly hit the fan (lost job and housing, live in a very overpriced struggle-tastic city), moved in temporarily with friends (who'd been randomly given free wine and two free cartons of cigarettes literally the day I moved in), partied. Smoked. They both left town and the remaining bottle of wine and the carton of cigarettes and I house-sat, alone, with $12 in my bank account, for two weeks while I continued to look for work and play really underpaying music gigs.  
  
So. F---.   
  
I'm now back to really straight-up smoking. I'm smoking a brand I hate (the free carton) and I think these are even more poisonous than the brand I smoked before; I feel absolutely and completely like shit. And I am completely addicted. Totally walked right into the mouse trap and now stuck there.   
  
With recent quitting experience under my belt, I know I can do this--I just have to isolate for 3 or 4 days and not have access to any cigarettes. I can get the roommates to hide theirs from me.  
  
In my case, I think with all the stress going on, I actually really should set a quit date so I can plan to at least have the basic stuff I need to survive days 1-3 again--like fruit juice and carrots and netflix. I know there's no time like the present but I really can't afford to be distracted by a craving in the middle of a job interview or something, so I need to do days 1-3 when I don't have anything life-altering going on. What do you think?  
Love & luck to all and thanks for being an awesome non-smoking group!!

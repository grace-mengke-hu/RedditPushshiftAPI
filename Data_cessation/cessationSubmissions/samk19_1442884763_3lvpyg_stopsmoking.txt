Really wanting a cigarette today.

Today's my last day on the nicotine patch. I still crave them pretty bad but I haven't had one. Tomorrow I'll start using nicotine gum when I have cravings. Its getting really difficult not to just start again, I want it so bad. But I'm not giving up. How is everyone else doing today?

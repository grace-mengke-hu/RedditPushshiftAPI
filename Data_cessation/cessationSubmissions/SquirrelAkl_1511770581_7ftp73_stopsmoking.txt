Frustrated, angry, irrational - I don't like myself much right now

Day 11 of not smoking.  In some ways it's easier than other times I've quit before - I don't actually want to smoke - but I'm finding I have SUCH a short fuse at the moment! I'm thinking irrational negative and bitchy thoughts, I'm overreacting to things, taking things personally, thinking the worst of people's intentions... I think PMS has unfortunately coincided with week 2 of not smoking - Danger, Will Robinson, Danger!!!  

I really don't want a cigarette, I know it'll be gross and give me a sore throat and I won't enjoy it, but goddam I just want to feel normal again!  

Any encouragement or perspective would be welcome right now. Also I just needed to vent.  Thank you for providing a place where I can do that :-)

I really miss smoking.

I am ten days in and find myself really missing the act of smoking: I miss it with my coffee first thing in the morning, in the car after work, with wine on my patio, after dinner, before I go to bed, during the night when I can't fall back to sleep, on the phone...it's not so much a craving but a longing.  Please help me.  Will this pass?

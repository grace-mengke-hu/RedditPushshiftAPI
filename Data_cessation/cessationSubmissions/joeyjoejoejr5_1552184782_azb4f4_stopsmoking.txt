Blood Flow - Erections

I’ve read all of the posts on blood flow and erection issues. Finally quit and I’m just hitting 34 days smoke free but my erection issues remain. I was about a 1/2 to a pack smoker for around 20 years. 

I’ve seen posts where your circulation begins to improve from anywhere within 2 to 12 weeks. I was hoping that I would be in the 2 week group, but I’m still waiting. Is there anyone here who it took longer than expected for their erections to return? How long did it take for them to get back to normal?

Somebody tell me they’re coming back and I just need to calm down and wait a little longer???

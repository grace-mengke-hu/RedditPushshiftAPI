Nicotine addiction low point...

Please don't judge, I know this is completely disgusting... 
So I quit smoking in 2012. I have since only dappled here and there. I have had maybe 7 cigarettes this whole year. 

So don't ask me why, but I had bought a pack, and smoked 4, then decided I needed to get rid of them last night. I threw them in the trash and kind of covered them up with a cup. Anyways, this morning, in sheer desperation, I dug them out of the trash to have just one more. So gross. I only smoke like half of that cigarette and put it out, wet it, and threw it away. So now, I'm freaking out that I'm going to end up with some sort of food poisoning for putting something from the trash near my mouth. The box wasn't wet, I wiped it off, and smoked half of one that was inside the box. Trash was last taken out yesterday, so there wasn't a ton in there, but my roommate did make sausage this morning, so the wrapper was in there, along with biscuit can. Coffee grounds. My gut says I'm over worrying, obviously don't do it again, but I'll probably be fine. I also brushed my teeth immediately after smoking. Besides this being a low point, am I going to be okay likely in the aspect of chance of food poisoning?? I know people do much riskier things, like eat food from garbage/dumpsters, and some have been known to smoke leftover cigarette butts in ashtrays...

Welcome to my nightmare.

Hey all,
I had been smoking for about 7 years and it's now been 2 weeks since i've touched a cigarette. I'be struggled to quit a few times in the past, but this time seems much easier and the last week has honestly been pretty effortless in avoiding the ciggs. I couldn't be happier but I have been having THE most intense nightmares i've had in my entire life. After a bit of google work, it seems as though this is fairly common amongst recent quitters. The nightmares are so bad that I sometimes find it hard to get back to sleep. This has been the case for the past three nights and it's getting old really quickly.
Has anybody else experienced this in their road to quitting?

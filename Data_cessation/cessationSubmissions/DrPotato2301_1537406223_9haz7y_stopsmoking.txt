I'm trying to convince myself to give in to my cravings.

It's been 29 days since I quit. And I haven't smoked a cigarette since then. During this period, I've hung out a couple of time with smoker friends, and didn't smoke even when I was offered a few times. I got super drunk twice and I didn't give into having a cigarette. 


I got into the habit of smoking after I started taking adderall for my ADHD. And I came to know a few months back that adderall and cigarettes works very well together. I realized that it would be hard to control my cravings when I was regularly taking adderall. So I quit smoking right before I had a break during which I didn't have to take adderall. 


I took an adderall IR in the morning and I've been craving a cigarette for like an hour now (I've been thinking about cigarette since around 7. 30pm). I just can't stop thinking about it. I didn't have such a strong craving during the past 28 days. I hate this!! 


I know that even a single puff would reset my progress, but still I almost convinced myself that it's okay to smoke once in a while and be a casual smoker even though deep down I know it won't work for me. 


I started smoking cigarettes in the March of 2017 and I failed to quit thrice since then. This is my fourth time trying to quit and I don't want to get back to smoking again!


FUCK CIGARETTES! FUCK NICOTINE!! It's ruining my night!

Quitting and integrity of quit date

Iâ€™m working on quitting for my second time in the last year and a half. It was a relapse of a couple months but still very much a relapse.

I counted my recovery date Saturday morning. Do you guys restart your stoppage date if you had a couple puffs off a cigarette one day? I want to make sure I am true to my date and wanted to get others perspective.

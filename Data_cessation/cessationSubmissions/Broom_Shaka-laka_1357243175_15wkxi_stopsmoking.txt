how would i even begin to stop?

About 3 years ago I moved to a country that still permits smoking indoors and most of the locales in my city contain smoking sections. As almost all of my friends here smoke, I picked up the habit in earnest (had always been an occasional smoke) and smoke anywhere between 1/4 of a pack and two packs in a day depending on the evening's activities and my stress level. I live in an apartment building that has a smoking area and it's right in front of my place. I already run, hike, ski, snowboard, play basketball, soccer, etc. etc. quite often.

Anyways, that's my story. So how do I quit without losing my friends or becoming a recluse? Any tips?

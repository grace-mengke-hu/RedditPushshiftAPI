Smelly Feet? Lol

I am 15 days smoke free now and I have noticed that my sense of smell has improved greatly. Did anyone notice that their feet or general sweat smelt worse? Lol I know this is a weird question. I read an article that said its just someone "realizing how we actually smell" and that non smokers are just used to it. I would like to think its all the nasty stuff purging from my system...but probably not. Hah!

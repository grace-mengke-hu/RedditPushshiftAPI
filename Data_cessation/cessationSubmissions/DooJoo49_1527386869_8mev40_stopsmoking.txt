Forgot how hard quitting actually is. Day 1.

I was offered a job in a medical group that tests for nicotine. So this pack-a-day smoker went cold turkey. With tons of research, I'm drinking a ton of water, juicing, healthy crap, vitamin c, Apple cider vinegar....just your general detox that I'll probably also use when I quit kratom. 

It's a $20/hr part time job with benefits so I can still do graveyard CNA shifts to get my experience up. My ultimate goal is BSN. But clearly, I gotta get my shit together first. Wish me luck. And luck to all of you as well!

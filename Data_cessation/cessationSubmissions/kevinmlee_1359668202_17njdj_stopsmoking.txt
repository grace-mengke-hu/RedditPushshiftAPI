Almost third day since quitting, is heartburn and indigestion common?

Is heartburn and indigestion common with quitting? I just started having terrible heartburn to the point where i am dry heaving. Haven't heard too much about it only a couple blog posts saying its possible but just wanted to see if anyone on here has experienced this. Thanks!

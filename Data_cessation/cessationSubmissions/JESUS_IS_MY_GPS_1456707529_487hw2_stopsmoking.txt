I think I'm tilting into addiction... Advice appreciated.

I've been ramping up as a casual smoker for about 2-3 years now. Roommates have always been heavy chain smokers, gf smokes, and a couple of my friends do too. I have been surrounded for years just casually bumming off people, more and more...

I've never bought a pack, but I find myself smoking one cigarette a day by bumming from people. I recently tried to stop for a week but only made it to day 4 and caved. It really worried me. I usually smoke at night when I'm really exhausted.

Clearly something needs to change as I do not want to slip further down the slope.

**Any** advice, stories, or insight on how I can turn this habit around as very welcomed. I don't want to get into the grips of serious addiction and I feel now is the time to reverse this compounding habit. Thanks

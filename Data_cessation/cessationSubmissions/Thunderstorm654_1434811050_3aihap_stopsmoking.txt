Two and a half years gone.

I had my first cigarette last night since February of 2013. We were drinking and other people in the group were smoking. I've been in that situation before with no problems staying away from smoking. But last night my friend got REALLY drunk and I was the one who ended up taking care of him. Making sure he threw up in the toilet and not in the bath tub, giving him water, propping him up so he doesn't pass out. It was a stressful night and I broke down and bummed a cigarette. 

It felt like my first cigarette actually. Coughing, that huge rush you feel all over your body. In the moment it felt great but as soon as I put it out I regretted it. That was not a smart move. So I had one cigarette. I'm not planning on having any more. I'm not even tempted. We can't change our actions yesterday or tomorrow, we can only change our actions today.

Forced to quit before quit date. Should I go back to smoking for 4 days?

I got a wicked cough last weekend, with chills and fevers, so I put a patch on my shoulder and just worked on feeling better.

I had planned to quit this Saturday (2013-12-21) as a birthday present to myself.

So now I've been smoke-free for 3 days, but feel like I was cheated out of a good quit date and a few more days of smoking. Any advice?

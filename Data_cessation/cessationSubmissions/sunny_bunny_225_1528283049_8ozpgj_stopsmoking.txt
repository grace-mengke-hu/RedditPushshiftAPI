How to help my bf quit again?

Hi guys, me and my boyfriend stopped smoking April 10th, after being heavy users for 8 years (me) and 13 years (him) it was a great experience to stop and while we were in the same location (long distance relationship) it it was quite easy to help eachother and keep us accountable. For the last few weeks my bf was under so much stress because of his family and job (I also didn't help) and he started smoking again last sunday. He is not back to the amount he smoked before but if you ask me it is just the matter of time.

I am trying to be supportive and not show my dissapointment but how can I motivate him from so far away to stop. Should I just wait until ı go there on the 13th (İt will be much harder then right?) I really hate to see him miserable like this so if you guys have any advice how to be a good accountability buddy from far away please share

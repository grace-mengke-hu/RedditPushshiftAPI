Stopping a friend before the addiction starts.

I am looking for advice and methods to stop a close friend from smoking before the addiction starts.

She is 19, and just started smoking about 2 weeks ago. Not alot, but about a cigarette every 1-2 days, using the excuse that its 'stress related'. I am about 90% sure this is an excuse when really she thinks its cool, because she is very spoilt and does not live anything close to a stressful lifestyle, I have lived with her and been around her a lot for the last 3 years, and she has all expenses paid by her parents, and works VERY rarely as a waitress at a small cafe. 

We have both seen what cancer can do to people, and have both had relatives killed off by cancer, which does not seem to deter her. She says she is not addicted, but it is only a matter of time, and after some persuasion, she has agreed to ditch them if I can find her some other techniques to relieve her 'stress'. I want to do this ASAP, as she is a very pretty and friendly girl, however our friendship group is utterly repulsed by smoking, and is begging to avoid her because of her new-found habits. 

Any and all help would be great Reddit

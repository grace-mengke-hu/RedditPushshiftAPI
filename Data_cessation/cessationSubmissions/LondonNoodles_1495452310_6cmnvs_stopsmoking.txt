5 days in only and I just can't remember what I liked about smoking!

I think I have put a lot of pressure on myself thinking it was gonna be super hard because I was smoking quite heavily (a pack a day for the past 6 months) but truth is I've never felt so good!

Also I thought people were maybe exaggerating about the fact that smoking kills your tastebuds, but oh my god I understand now and I understand why they do it! All the food I ate quite regularly tastes so much better than it used to, it's insane! I've also had to wash all my clothes several times because I can now notice how everything smells of cigarette, when I wasn't aware before, and it STINKS!!!

On saturday night, I got a bit drunk, and a friend offered me a cigarette which I mechanically accepted, and when I inhale the first puff, I thought I was gonna throw up! It tastes horrible! It burns your throat, and has an awful aftertaste! I turned it off and got back to my delicious bubble gum, and that gave me confirmation I will never smoke again, because it's just disgusting.

Good luck to all and I strongly suggest that free app "smoke free", it really helped me get some perspective in the first days! Thanks to all for your precious tips as well :)

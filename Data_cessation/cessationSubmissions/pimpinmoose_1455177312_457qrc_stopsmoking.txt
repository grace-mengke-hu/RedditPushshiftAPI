Smoked a cigar, should I feel bad?

Hello everyone, I have not smoked a cigarette for about 43 hours now and I had such a bad craving yesterday (caused by stress) that I went out to buy a pack. But before paying the money for cigarettes I grabbed a cigar instead and smoked it without inhaling any smoke.

The app that I'm using says %88 of nicotine in my body has already been expelled and I haven't craved since yesterday evening so I want to stick with the quit. My only question for now is, do cigars count while quitting? I know they are also harmful but I think I did a pretty good job of controlling myself and not buying a pack. However, I still feel a little bit guilty.

PS: I drink the strongest coffee I know whenever I get hungry to control my weight after quitting. It might help you too.

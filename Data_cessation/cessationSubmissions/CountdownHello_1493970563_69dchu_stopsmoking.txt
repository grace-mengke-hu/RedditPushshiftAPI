How I became a happy Nonsmoker

Jogging, L-Tyrosin, 5-HTP (supplements) and Cranberries will help you through the time of withdrawal (they reduce mood swings to almost zero). Search for apps as well (e.g. Smoke Free).
Be aware that your body didn't get enough vitamins as a smoker. You feel weak / energyless caused by a lack of vitamine C, A, E, Beta-Coratin, Zink and Selen. Fix it. See a doctor or make tests (e.g. https://www.cerascreen.co.uk). Eat healthy.
Never forget the 3 pillars to overcome successful withdrawal:
1. Strong Mind (Psychology)
2. Strong physical condition (enough dopamin & Serotonin in the brain to feel ok)
3. Social support (friends, partner or a good app on your phone)
Last but not least:
Main reason to fail is because you don't feel happy or you have added weight. Therefore, eat healthy (less sugar / carbohydrates) and make sure that you are happy. Get a pet, find a new hobby, make new friends, make some sport, read a book, make a trip, do some art, go into the nature, take a timeout, learn how to ride a horse or learn french cooking. Understand, there ARE many things which you have never tried but they might make you happy. All you need is to become ACTIVE. Good luck and share. Thx

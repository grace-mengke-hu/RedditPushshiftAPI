Downhill in 6 months

I'm a 31 year old female that was a nonsmoker all my life, and hated to be around people that smoked. 2 years ago I started dating a guy that smoked pipe tobacco, which I didn't mind as much because it smells better. About 6 months ago I had been going through a really stressful time and felt the urge to try smoking his pipe tobacco and  I've been a heavy smoker ever since. 

I smoke when I wake up, and I smoke several times a day (I'm self employed and work from home so I find myself smoking at least once an hour.) I don't know why I feel compelled to do it, even in the beginning it didn't make me feel good, mostly sick and anxious. Now I have a constant cough and rough voice, no energy, I sleep terrible, and my skin looks awful. People used to tell me I looked much younger than my age but in just 6 months my skin has deteriorated so much and I've developed lines and I wrinkles that make me look older. 

Today I woke up with a cough worse than ever and am coughing up thick dark yellowish stuff. I told myself that's it, I have to quit, but I still couldn't resist and smoked twice today. 

The weird thing is that I went on two business trips in the last few months where I was gone for about a week each and didn't bring my tobacco. I was fine and had no cravings whatsoever while I was gone. As soon as I get home though it's back to smoking non-stop. 

I want the old me back, I want my healthy looking skin and my normal voice. I want to be able to breathe.

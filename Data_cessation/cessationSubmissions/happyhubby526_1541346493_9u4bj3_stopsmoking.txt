Starting tomorrow... need all the help I can get

I have been smoking for 20 years... started at 18. Then I played years of baseball in college and professionally and began dipping. Over the course of the last 15 years I have nicotine flowing through me constantly. 
  I have a kids and I know I need to quit and be free. The time is right but I donâ€™t know if I can do it. 
  I work a high stress job... and have attempted quitting many times. Only getting through a day or two. I can use some support.

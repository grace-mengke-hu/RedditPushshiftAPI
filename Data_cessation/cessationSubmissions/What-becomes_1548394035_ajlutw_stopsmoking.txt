I'm done with them.

Today is my last one. I'm sick of paying $38 a pack for you. I'm sick of coughing in the morning, im sick of the smell of it. I'm sick of being out of breath. I'm sick of using you as a crutch when I'm upset or stressed. You no longer taste anything but unpleasant to me. I just do it out of habit. I'll find another way to deal with my hand to mouth oral fixation, chewing gum is far better for me. 

No more. Day 1 starts now.

Quitting and gaming

Sometime is feels like quiting is the hardest thing I will ever do. I posted on facebook, as I am posting here for the first time, just to share a quick story and hopefully relieve some of the stress I feel at a week in. I am in the process of quitting and I felt like I would lash out for no reason. I decided to keep my self preoccupied so I couldn't focus on all the shitty feelings. I started playing world of warcraft again, and it has been a tremendous help. My aunt heard of some of the things that have helped me, and now (after her 30 years) she is willing to try it with me. So here's to another cessation method I hope can help me kick the habit! I enjoy lingering in this sub because people share the same struggles and triumphs, so hopefully in 6 months I can post a very similar story!

Quitting Nicotine Gum

Screw it, r/stopsmoking is about as close as I'm going to get to a reasonably active subreddit about quitting nicotine.

I quit smoking in 1998 and started chewing/dipping/nicotine gum.  Basically I've been chewing nicotine gum since then.

I quit drinking alcohol in 2011 with the help of a 12 step program, which was the best thing that I've ever done.  I've tried to kick the nicotine a few times since then, but have always given in after a few days.

Just downloaded smoke free and input the $$ and metricks for nicotine gum rather than cigarettes.  I've been really good about adopting lifestyle changes as of recent months, but only if I stay accountable.  So from time to time I'll stop by and comment or post - who cares if it says "smoke" - I'll just substitute "gum" in my mind - it's all just nicotine addiction.

Hey look, my app says I've saved $0.23 so far.  How cool is that?

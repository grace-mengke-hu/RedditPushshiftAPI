Payday is tomorrow

And I'm determined to make today's pack the last. I'm currently on the sick until Tuesday for mental health reasons and I can't bare the thought of going back to work still smoking and still wasting my money and health.

I weigh 134lbs 6ft tall, there are a few things I need to purchase with my pay that I'd rather have instead of cigarettes so that's part of my motivation. I have many many supplements ready to take that I haven't been consistent with in the past, but I have a pill box now it's it's become much easier keeping it up.

It's so weird because the odd day where I don't smoke I feel a lot calmer, my OCD is reduced yet due to boredom and this feeling of loss, I end up buying another pack.

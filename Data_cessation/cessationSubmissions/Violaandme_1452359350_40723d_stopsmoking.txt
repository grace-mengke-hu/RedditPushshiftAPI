Growing young

So I quit some time ago now February 18th 2015, and only recently found all you quitters. What a wonderfully supportive group you all are spewing encouragement at every turn. I wish you all long term success and happiness not only in quitting the gaspers but in life in general. 

I also wanted to say to any new or wannabe quitters that my skin and face look so much better in only those few short months but more importantly my lungs feel so much younger and work so so much better already.

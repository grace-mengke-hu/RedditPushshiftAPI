Headaches

When will the headaches stop from quitting cold turkey? This is day 4 of constant headaches. And it's killing me. I also started having hot flashes since I quit? 

I'm miserable. And where I work EVERYONE smokes. It's terrible walking in there. Everytime it creeps up on the time I usually smoke at work I start shaking and my heart beat gets out of control. 

Someone tell me when this all will pass.

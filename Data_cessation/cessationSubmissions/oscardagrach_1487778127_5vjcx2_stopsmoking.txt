[18 days] Looking for some advice

It's been 18 days for me as of today. This is probably the billionth time I've attempted quitting. I actually replaced cigarettes a few years ago and moved on to snus and disposable e-cigs. I go through one of each every 24-48 hours. I needed a break from the high blood pressure, the headaches, the insomnia, etc... I'm cutting out all nicotine for good. 

My question for you guys who've long-term quit is does the sensation that you need a 'hit' or a buzz of some sort go away? I don't really have the stereotypical nicotine/tobacco cravings (I did at first) but it's molded into a generic buzz-seeking crave, and not necessarily tied to nicotine. It's been really difficult to deal with, and I'm looking for some reassurance that it will fade over time. Has anyone else experienced this?

I am currently trying to stop

Ok, I made a throwaway for this as people know my main account name and very few people know I smoke.


I am currently trying to quit. It is so hard, all I can think is day dreaming about when I am next going to have a cigarette. Its only been 24 hours but I can see a corner shop from both my living room window and the window of my work. I have constant itchy feet to go and buy a pack of smokes and it is getting to me.


I also work a stressful job where smoking is viewed very negatively which makes it all the harder. This is also coupled with my partner not being paid the past couple of months. I know how bad it is for me, I know the health risks, I know how bad it is for my wallet. That doesn't make it any easier to stop smoking. It is now coming up to lunchtime and I am determined to not cave in.


I just caved and bought some more. Has anyone got any advice for what to do so I don't cave like this? It's really getting me down and I'm not sure if it is my personal life or withdrawals causing this. I am determined not to chain smoke this pack I just bought (not that I really chain smoke, I will have 5 or so a day but I am determined to only have 1 in the morning as a way of weaning myself off). Every pack I buy is the last but I always go back. I would just throw them away but then the regret of relapsing combined with the waste of money will be too much.

Just hit 2 weeks, progress report

I've been good. Mostly. I've cheated with one cigarette per 3 days on average. So it would appear I'm simply a social smoker, right? But I know that's just my lizard brain being tricked by chemicals that are trying to kill me.

I'm going to be completely smoke free, but I need to figure out how to stop myself giving in to those temptations every few days where I say "what the hell" and do it. So far I've been making do with my gas station disposable e-cigs, but these cheater cigs have been happening when that just wasn't cutting it. Alcohol is a non-factor, it's happened when I was dry too.

Advice and/or scolding welcome.

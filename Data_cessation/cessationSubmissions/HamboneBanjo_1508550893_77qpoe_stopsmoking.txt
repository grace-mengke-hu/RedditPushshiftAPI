Cravings are slim to none but not sleeping great lately. Looking for relevant input.

Same goes for my wife. I hope we get past this hump soon. It gets to be a bit much sometimes. I try to remain aware of the real issue but the hardest times come in the middle of the night when my mind is at it's pettiest and it's easy to get riled up about work and the minutiae of life. 

There's some decent info to be found online, which sounds great in theory but isn't necessarily all helpful all the time. I think it's time to increase and renew my stress management routines. I'm looking for new options that I possibly haven't considered or haven't yet begun. I'm going to pick a few and incorporate them, presuming I get some input from you kind folks.

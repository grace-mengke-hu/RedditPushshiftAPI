Day 1...again. Wellbutrin is a wonderful, horrible miracle.

Here we go again.

I quit in November easily and successfully with Wellbutrin. Unfortunately, it gave me awful anxiety and I spun into a depression which didn't lift for a couple months. Good riddance and I felt great for a while!

Then, we moved. With the stress of the move I stupidly picked up smoking again. Now I live in a nice neighborhood with little privacy where it seems like everyone is a perfect little non-smoking healthy athlete. I feel so awful. I decided to quit and started taking my wellbutrin again a couple days ago. Today is the first day without a smoke. But the side effects of the drug bother me more. I spent 2 hours online shopping for a laundry hamper (didn't buy one), cried while listening to Radiohead for an hour, and had a mild panic attack at the grocery store because I couldn't find parmesean wedges. 

Man, I can't wait to be done with it. Should only be a few more days. 

Anyone else have amazing effectiveness with smoking cessation, but almost unbearable side effects of wellbutrin (bupropion)?

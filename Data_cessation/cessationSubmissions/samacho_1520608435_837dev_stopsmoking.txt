Made it to day 5!

This is just me giving myself a little public pat on the back because once the clock hits 11pm today I will have made it through the first 5 days. 

I've posted on here a couple of times about quitting and never followed through beyond the first couple of days. I'm so happy that I've made it this far and I'm looking forward to being able to confidently call myself a non-smoker (the cravings are still too strong for me to do this now lol). 

While most of my participation in this sub has been silent, I still appreciate all the positivity and determination of the folks in here. It has definitely helped and I wish all of us the best of luck. â™¥

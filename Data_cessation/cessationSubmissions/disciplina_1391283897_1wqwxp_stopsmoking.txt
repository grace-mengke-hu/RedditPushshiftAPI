2nd try here

i tried once and after a week or so i failed... but there was a guy that week that motivated me a lot. He sent me pm's here everyday which was awesome. Now im trying again Cold Turkey. Haven't had a smoke all day and its 20:45 here 

EDIT: Sorry for the late reply but i haven't had any internet for 2 days thats the bad news. The good news is im still a non-smoker and i fucking wont smoke again ! Thanks for the big support :))

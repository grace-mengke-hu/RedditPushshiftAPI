Nicotine gum

I quit smoking in 1997.  I do not have cravings for cigarettes, and have not craved a cigarette in more than ten years.

In times of great stress, however, I will go and buy a box of nicotine gum, the 2mg kind, and chew that.

I quit drinking a couple of months ago, and bought some nicotine gum. I quite enjoy the gum, which probably sounds crazy.

So...is this bad to chew gum aside from using it to quit cigarettes?  Do I need to stop?  I probably chew about 5 pieces a day.

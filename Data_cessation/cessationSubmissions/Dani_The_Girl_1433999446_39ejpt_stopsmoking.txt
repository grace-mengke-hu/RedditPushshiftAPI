I just feel off...again. Cigarettes make me feel like shit. It's the feeling of the first drag that I am addicted to.

The first time i started smoking lasted about 2.5 years. I started because I lived with a roommate that smoked. I quit cold turkey...it sucked but it worked. I was off Cigs for more than a year and again I started up due to living with a smoker.

Once again I dropped it cold turkey...initiate full blown Hulk Mode.

I now **AGAIN** find myslef living with a smoker. I am smoking again...consistantly for about a 10 days now. I literally just put out a cig and feel shitty and guilty. I wake up with a headache...have a headache...smoke to get the fix and 3 drags in I feel shitty and guity. I know better...I really do...fuck my dudes...I know what I have to do....but fucking shit I don't look forward to the next 30 days of cessastion. 

Please help. Any first few day Pro Tips are more than welcomed. I'm disappointed I am at this point again. I recognize the pattern...being around smokers absolutely triggers my habit. So what can I do from here on out to resist when I am getting wiffs of cigs while I'm at home? I literally am in bed and can smell it blowing into my room through the ventilation system.

Also any Pro tips for combating the headaches and all around withdrawal symptoms. Much Gratitude in Advance.

Need some advise here.

Hey there,
Tried many times to quit, like everyday. Tonight i decided to throw the last few cigarettes i had in my house.
Now the big problem is what to do if i feel a need of a cigarette, i had this problem many times and i would just ask for a cigarette or buy a pack.
I really need a way to calm down and avoid doing that again.
Any ideas? What do you guys do when you feel you want one?

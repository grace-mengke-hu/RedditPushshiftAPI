Here we go again....

Made it 87 days last time, then I convinced myself "I can have one; it can't hurt"...which became one a day. Which became 3 a day. Which became going back to the old habit.

Well, I moved with my fiance this weekend and didn't smoke the entire 1400 mile / 3 day drive. Now is a good time to start again.

I'll reset my badge, as my last smoke was around 9PM on Friday. 

I can do this.

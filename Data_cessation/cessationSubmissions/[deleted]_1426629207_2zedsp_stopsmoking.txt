Day 4

Hi! I'm new on this site and not sure if I know how it works yet. I have smoked for 21 years and just had a baby and decided to stop. I'm using champix and seems to go well (patches didn't work with me on my last 2 times of trying to stop). Has anybody used champix before? Something I'm really scared is to feel very low and anxious on the next few weeks. Any advice is welcome. Thanks!

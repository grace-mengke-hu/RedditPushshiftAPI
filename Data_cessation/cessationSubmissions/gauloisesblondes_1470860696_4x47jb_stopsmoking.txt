greetings from another life

So itÂ´s a year now. I do not feel proud. I feel ashamed that I did not stop earlier. I am ashamed that I smoked for 20 years and spent so much money on ruining my health, being unfit and stinking out of my mouth. Quitting cigarettes was the beginning of a new life. I got a huge drive out of it and because I quit smoking succesfully I changed my life in other areas too. I am eating more healthy now, I work out almost every day, my problems with high blood pressure are gone. Even mentally I feel much better and a lot more stable. I feel 10 years younger now than I felt a year ago. 
Smoking? Fuck that. Never again. And you can stop it too!

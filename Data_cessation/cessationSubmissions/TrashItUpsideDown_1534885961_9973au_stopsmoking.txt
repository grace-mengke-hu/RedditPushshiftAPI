Giving it another go

Trying again because I was sick last week. Now I've got 7 days down and a lifetime to go. I've already noticed some huge changes too! My taste is better, which means I should probably learn to cook better food. My tongue doesn't feel like it's on fire all the time anymore! My heartburn is still flares up but is not nearly as severe.

I do however have a pretty persistant cough. I thought it was me just getting over my illness but it's stayed since I started feeling better, so I assume it's my lungs trying to heal from all the shit I've been inhaling for 5 years. It really hits me how terrible smoking is for you everytime I cough up more yellow shit.

Anyway things are looking up, I'm almost six months sober, 1 week smoke free, and I'm trying to get in shape again. Next step is to find a better job. I wish you guys all the best and if I could borrow our daily mantra from r/stopdrinking, I will not smoke with you today!

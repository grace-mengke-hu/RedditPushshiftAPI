When people ask if I FEEL better

People keep asking me if I feel better, and I keep say, to be honest, no... I don't feel any different. I don't feel like I've suddenly gained the ability (or desire) to run long distances. I don't feel like I'm being better to myself... Food doesn't magically taste better... 

But today I just realized, It's September 3... and I did not get my annual bout of insane end of August allergies.  It's usually so bad, like my sinuses get infected and my throat feels like its full of razors....  But this year, nothing. I feel a SLIGHT congestion in my throat on the super humid days this week, but that's it.

So even if you don't think you FEEL better - just remember - you ARE better!!!

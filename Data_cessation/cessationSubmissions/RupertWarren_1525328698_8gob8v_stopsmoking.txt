New here. Looking to quit but can't seem to get out of my own way.

I am not a heavy smoker, one a night, so if I don't belong here I understand. Please let me know in the comments.

I smoked for two years straight, quit for a year for my girlfriend. Then last year I started smoking pom-pom(like a little cigar). I smoke them every night, and on the nights that I try to not I end up talking myself into it. I lie to my girlfriend and it's eating me up inside. I have an addictive personality, both my parents are smokers and alcoholics. I really wanna quit again but I need help and support, if you'll have me I'd love to be apart of your community. 

Thanks,

W

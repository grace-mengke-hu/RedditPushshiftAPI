Quitting cold turkey. 5 days with no nicotine!

Hi guys. I quit smoking cigarettes on Saturday night, so roughly 5 days ago. I've often laid in bed before sleep running through all of the different reasons why smoking is a waste of money, a waste of health, and a bad idea. Yet this time, it seemed to stick.

I didn't have my normal pre-bedtime cigarette(s) Saturday evening, and woke up motivated to quit. I decided to not use nicotine replacement therapies because I don't want to extend the length of time that I withdraw from the nicotine in my body. I've actually been having some health issues since quitting (chest pains, lack of energy, stomach pains, etc.), but I'm really looking forward to a smoke-free life from now on!

For those wondering, I've been chewing sugar-free gum and chewy candies to help deal with the physical withdrawal symptoms. Be careful with the sugar-free gum, BTW, because I've been told the sorbitol it contains causes stomach issues. For the psychological symptoms, I've been taking quick-paced walks every time the urge to smoke strikes. 

Here's to another couple of days of no smoking to make it a solid week! I look forward to quitting with you guys! :)

edit - In case it's important or helps others, I wanted to include how much I *did* smoke previously. Before quitting, I usually averaged about 2 packs a day, so it was a pretty bad habit.

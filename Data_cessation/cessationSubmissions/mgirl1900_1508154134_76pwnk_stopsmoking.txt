Question for the long time quitters

Just wondering at what Point in your quit did your quit start to take a back burner in your brain? When was quitting no longer at the forefront of your thoughts . I am almost at 2 months quit and although I don't have strong cravings anymore smoking is still in my brain too often ...looking forward to the day I no longer have it in my thoughts all the time :((

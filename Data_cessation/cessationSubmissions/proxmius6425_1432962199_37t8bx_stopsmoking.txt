Advice to get family to stop smoking?

My entire family smokes, around me and in our house. I'm a biochemist and despite my attempts to explain to them scientifically the dangers of smoking, they write me off and tell me to shut up and that they don't have cancer and it's a farce. I'm at the point where I don't want to be around them, and have tried ultimatums in the past and was unsuccessful. Does anyone have advice on how to deal with a house full of smokers?

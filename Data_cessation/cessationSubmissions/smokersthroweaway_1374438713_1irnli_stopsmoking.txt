Want to quit, but am hesitant because of insurance uncertainty

First post here, and I'm turning here because I can't find information anywhere else on the subject. I am a undergraduate student who first started smoking at the age of 17 and have been for almost 4 years now. Lately I've been smoking anywhere from half to a full pack a day. I finally feel that I'm ready to quit, but want to get patches to aid with cessation. I simply can't afford them over the counter, and the open meetings the university provides with provide them to students there don't start for two more months. I am thinking about going to see a doctor at the university health center to get a perscription, but am hessitant because I'm unsure if it would affect my health insurance. I'm on a family plan and my family doesn't know that I smoke. I know that if I were getting insurance by myself it would come up, but I'm not sure whether or not they ask on family plans or how it would affect things if the person filling out the application was in the dark about it. If I see a doctor for cessation assistance, would any potential discrepancy be reported to my insurance provider? I want help, but have been hessitant to seek it because of this. Any advice would be really appreciated, thanks to everyone in advance.

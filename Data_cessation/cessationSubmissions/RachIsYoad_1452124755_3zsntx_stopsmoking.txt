Death of a routine and crazy shaking

Well I've done it and I have been a non-smoker for 41 hours! Woohoo! While the cravings come and go, the oddest thing about this is the change of routine. Like sometimes I don't feel like I'm craving exactly, just that it's time for a smoke. I tell myself nope you don't have to get up and go outside, you can keep doing what you're doing, but it still feels weird because of the break in routine. However, I am adjusting that routine accordingly and have gotten a lot done, especially in times of bad cravings when I HAVE to stay busy. 

Also, a quick question. Has anyone had fever chill - like symptoms? Last night was rough. I was freezing, yet my bf said I was on fire. I kept shaking. It sounds like withdrawal from something else and I can't imagine nicotine has that strong of an effect? Maybe I'm getting sick... But just wondering if anyone else has experienced something similar?

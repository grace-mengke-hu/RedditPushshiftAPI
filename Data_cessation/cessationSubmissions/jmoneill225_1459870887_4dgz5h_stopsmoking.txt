"Mommy why do you want to die?"

After my 5 year old broke down crying asking me why I wanted to die, I knew it was time to quit. I knew it was slowly killing me but it took him to say that to make me open my eyes. I promised him that I would quit and that is what I remind myself of each day. I am not going to lie, it has been a rough few days but I have remained strong. I hope to continue to post positive results.

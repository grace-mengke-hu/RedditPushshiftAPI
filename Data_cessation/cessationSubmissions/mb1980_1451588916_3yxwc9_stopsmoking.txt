Thank You

Not sure why I'm even writing this, I think it's guilt.  I quit smoking almost 4 months ago.  I quit the vape 118 days ago.  Today I bought some juice, skipped the meds and went back on the vape (with nicotine).  I couldn't take the anxiety and depression, or the meds prescribed, told to stop taking them, changed the prescription and restarted, and then changed by my doctor again (they did help, but came with their own set of demons).  Unfortunately for my quit, I feel better already mentally, and I don't know how I can re-quit without spending another 3 months feeling like that everyday or even if I want to.  I think I'll stay subbed, who knows what the new year will bring.  I wanted to thank everyone that encouraged me along my journey, and wish all you quitters the best of luck in the new year.

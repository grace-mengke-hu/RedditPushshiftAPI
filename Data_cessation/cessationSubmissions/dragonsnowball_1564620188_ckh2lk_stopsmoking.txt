Self Care

I really believe one of the keys to quitting smoking is drowning out the negative and focusing on the positive. You have to have compassion for yourself, you have to forgive yourself, so that you can visualize a different path, a better path. I have screwed up lately but I can still see the path ahead and it doesn't involve cigarettes. I am working on becoming a stronger person. It's a tough and often lonely path but it's well worth the fight.

I'm giving up

Yup, I can't make it through. I will try later. But for now, I am going to remove my badge. I hate myself for doing this, but it is what it is. I have no power left to resist smoking anymore. 

Thank you for you support, and sorry for being a disappointment. If anything, I had never made it this far through. I am sure I can do this again, but just not now.

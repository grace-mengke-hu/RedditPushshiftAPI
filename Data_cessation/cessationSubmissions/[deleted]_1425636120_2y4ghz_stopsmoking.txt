I will be strong.

Last two days was a bit rough in my quit journey. I have been thinking about smoking, but know that smoking will not solve the issues at hand. I suppose this is a test to see how I can deal with stress on my own. 

Smoking does nothing for you except drain cash, destroy health, and reduce social confidence. 

My word, this little plant and it's poison has a tight grip, but I will be strong in my abstinence. 

Cheers, 
Renegade.

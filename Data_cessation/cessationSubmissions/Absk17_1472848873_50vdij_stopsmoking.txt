About 3 weeks and going great so far. Need advice

Would be great if you guys could help me out on the below two things:
1. Is it okay to smoke weed/hash once in a while? Does it increase the chances of a relapse?
2. Is it necessary to cut out other smokers from your life? My flatmate is a smoker and so are few of my colleagues whom I accompany sometimes for smoke-breaks. While I haven't felt the need to smoke yet even around smokers, I'm afraid if it's just a matter of one weak moment.

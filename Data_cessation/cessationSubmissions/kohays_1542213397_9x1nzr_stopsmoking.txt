I accidentally got addicted to nicotine and vaping.

Ever since I was a senior in high school and started partying whenever I would drink I would hit vapes because I like the buzz. Never really smoked cigs since I find them gross but now for the last couple weeks I started hitting juuls and I'm addicted now to nicotine. It's not too bad but recently I bought myself a vuse areo and I need help quitting before it gets worse. Does anyone have some tips on how to stop this before it gets to the point where I need nicotine?? I literally start to only become focused on it after not smoking it for a while.

Been dreaming about smoking.

I've had a few weird dreams these last few days where I had been smoking in them.

Then when I wake up I have a confusing few minutes of 'did I really...  Did that just happen?'

I'd like them to stop! Got any advice on stopping them or is this just something I need to ride out every so often? Anyone else been through this?

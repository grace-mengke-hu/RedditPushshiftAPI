Relapsed after over two years of being a non-smoker. Need words of encouragement

I went to a music festival over Halloween and most of my friends that I went with smoke. Long story short, there were late nights with libations and I said fuck it. Well, I've been smoking a little on-and-off since then until last night. I probably had about 10 cigarettes all in all. I have "re-quit." Any words of encouragement from anyone who has experienced a relapse after so long? I was to the point of having no cravings and cigs grossed me out.

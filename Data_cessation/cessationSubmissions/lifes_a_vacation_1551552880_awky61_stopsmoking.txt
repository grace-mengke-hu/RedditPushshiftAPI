I wanna punch a fucking wall

I’m doing cold turkey. I know it’s not the easiest way but I’m the type of person who can’t be weaned or else it’ll never happen. It just has to stop point blank. But I’m on day 2 and I wanna kill everyone I come in contact with. I’ve cried twice today, once because I thought about something that passed me off at work a week ago and another time because I was hungry and couldn’t get food right then. I’m quitting nicotine all together but I’ve been gaping for about 6 months. And the nicotine in mine was about 3x a strong as a cigarette. I already wanna give up but I know that’s not an option. PLEASE. Any advice on coping.

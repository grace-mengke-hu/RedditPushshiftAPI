Tapering off the patch? Opinions?

NOTE: I am not trying to stir up a CT vs NRT debate here...

I've been on the 14 mg patch for two weeks now and just picked up my second box. Cravings are down to 1-3 a day and pretty easily staved off. Realized when I changed my shirt after work that today's patch was stuck to it, and not me. I'm thinking about trying to go every other day without a patch for the next two weeks. Has anyone tried that? Would that be of any benefit?

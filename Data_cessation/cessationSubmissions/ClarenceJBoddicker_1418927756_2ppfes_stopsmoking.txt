On day 4 of no smoke or drink. Starting to feel the pressure.

So typical cravings.  Been on the sauce and cigs regularly for a few years.  Quit before twice for 4 months.  I found the reason I would give in was always because there was not much else to do...boredom and too much free time.  

Tried AA and it was not at all right for me.  The second time I somehow just stopped with minimal cravings throughout until I went camping and huge triggers were too much to handle.

So what are some things to fill in the gaps?

Thanks

Quitting while in school

So I quit smoking over winter break and started spring semester a few weeks ago. I have noticed that it i so much more difficult to concentrate and discipline myself to sit down and do my work this semester. I'm thinking it may be due to no longer smoking. I know that when I was smoking, I took a break about every hour and it did feel like a nice reward and just taking a break helped as well. Did anyone else feel like they didn't concentrate as well after they quit? I've been quit for almost 2 months, so I wasn't expecting this.

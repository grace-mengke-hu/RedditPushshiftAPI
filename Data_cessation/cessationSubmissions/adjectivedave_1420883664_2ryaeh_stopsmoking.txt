Constipation and running

So i've been smoke and nicotine free for 10 days, and i haven't pooped in about 10 days and was feeling really shitty (bum tsch).

Eating loads of fiber wasn't helping and i very nearly turned to laxatives.

I've been running from around June last year but actually haven't been in 2015, so i went for my first run this morning. When i got back i had a massive dump.

Not sure how to end this but hopefully someone will find it of use!

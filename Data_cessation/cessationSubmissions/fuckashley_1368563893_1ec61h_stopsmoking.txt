The three day hump is a real thing.

Yesterday was my third smoke free day and frankly, it was awful. Today, however, I feel great! I haven't thought about smoking all day until now, and even then it wasn't a craving just a thought. I know it still won't be easy but I'm really proud of my self and I feel like I can do anything!

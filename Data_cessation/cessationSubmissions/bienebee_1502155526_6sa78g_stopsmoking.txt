Day 8 cold turkey - the coughing started

I've experienced something that feels like the beginning of sore troath for the past two days and a runny nose. Thightness in my chest and coughing with mucus started tonight. I am at my parents house, fairly isolated, which was the plan for the first 3 weeks. I had truly horrible days 3 and 4, but i've been feeling ok after that. My cravings seem manageable, but the current situation makes me so frustrated cause i felt ok while smoking and now i feel like shit, even though i've made a healthy choice. I am 24, been smoking 1 to 1.5 packs a day for the past 3 years and I'm otherwise quite healthy and fit. I have a boyfriend that started becoming regular instead of casual smoker because of me and that gave me initiative for this quitting attempt after a failed one a year ago. For the past year i truly hated each cig i smoked and i have many good reasons for quitting, but my current state makes me forget that. I am skinny, I like to eat healthy food, I swim regularly, I don't drink, I've reduced weed to occasional use and somehow my brain keeps suggesting that smoking isn't as bad for me as for people with more risk factors. I know this is UTTER BULLSHIT. Can that  be some twisted way of manifesting the craving, cause they last for a few mins, and pass if i just start doing something else?

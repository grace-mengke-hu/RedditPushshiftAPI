It's very very doable, I'm living proof!

I think I missed my exact anniversary because I probably don't even think about cigarettes every day anymore, but 3 years!  

Second serious try with Allen Carr worked for me.  10 year habit that had escalated to about 25 cigs per day on weekdays and even more on weekends.  You can do it!

Can we talk about the cough...

I’m just over 2 weeks on my final quit. I’ve quit for months at a time before, but always relapsed. I’m getting to the age where I know I really need to start taking care of my body if I want to live a long, happy, and healthy life. I’ve also been going through intensive therapy due to a mental breakdown I had last fall after many traumas in life, and no longer want to self sabotage or harm. I don’t drink anymore, not that I had a problem but I was prone to using one drink as an excuse to relapse into smoking. I don’t party anymore or do any of the things that might trigger me (outside of that morning cup of coffee, haven’t given up the caffeine just yet). So I’m feeling good and I’m feeling confident I will never touch a cigarette again.

But GOD. DAMN. This effing cough is driving me crazy. To the point where I can’t sleep comfortably so I’m missing out on sleep. All the other times I quit the cough hasn’t been this bad or lasted this long. I also have heavily smoked since I last picked it back up prior to this quit, so that’s probably the cause of the severity this time. I’ve been staying very well hydrated and doing gargles with salt or coconut oil, but it’s to no avail. 

I know this is a normal symptom. I know that it’s good because my body is expelling all the crap that’s no good for me. It just doesn’t feel very rewarding to be hacking my lungs up. Like my lungs are like congrats on quitting, boy do I have a fun prize for you. 

This is mostly a rant and to see if anyone else experiences this problem and needs to vent. However if anyone has any tips on how to alleviate this cough it would be much appreciated.

Stay strong Non-Smokers!

E-cig, which one?

Hi everyone,

So I'd like to try quitting by stopping normal cigarettes and using an e-cig.

I have 0 knowledge about these devices and would like some info on which one to buy.

I'm willing to spend up to 75 euro on it. The quality doesn't have to be the best as I'm only planning to use it for a month or so.


Can anyone recommend me one?

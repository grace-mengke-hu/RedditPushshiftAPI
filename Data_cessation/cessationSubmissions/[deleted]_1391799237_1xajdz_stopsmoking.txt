A realisation I had

For me stopping smoking it's not too hard, the only reason I go back to smoking it's because I enjoy it and I don't smoke too much so I don't fear the consequences. At the moment I'm on day 5 cigarette free just to prove myself I can stop it anytime.

I will probably go back to smoking eventually. The bottom line is that I feel the biggest deterrent to stop smoking is not the addiction itself but to have a reason to. So for instance I 'd rather live a few years less than don't smoke or eat fats, but for the same reason I won't become a heavy smoker either, lest I develop a horrible disease.

I've smoked for less than a year so I only realise now that campaigns and raising public awareness may be the single most important thing, rather than fighting the addiction. Thoughts?

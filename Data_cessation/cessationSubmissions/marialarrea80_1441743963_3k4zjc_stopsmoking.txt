I'm avoiding alcohol... for how long?

So when I slipped on day 4 last Friday I smoked and drank all that I wanted. I'm not a heavy drinker so it's not a problem to avoid it, but a holiday is coming and I'm sure we will go to restaurants to have nice dinners and drink wine. I would say that (I normally drink red wine) that if i drink alcohol the next few days is going to be lager, something different that I do not associate with smoking. It might sound stupid as being in a bar having lager and everybody smoking around me is going to be soooooooo tough!!! At the moment will definitely avoid it! I have just started day 4, I can do it!!!!!! Stay strong everybody.

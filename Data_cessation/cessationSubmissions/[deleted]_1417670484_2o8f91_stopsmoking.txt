Just stubbed out my last cigarette

I was a heavy smoker for over ten years. As I write this, the smoke from my last cigarettes is still wafting before my computer screen. And even though this will be my third attempt to quit, so I know what I'm getting into, I also know that this time (for five good reasons) I am going to make it stick.

Anyway, it still ain't easy, so I just sub'ed and will be dropping by here from time to time for tips, advice, or just to shamelessly angle for support. 

P.S. Not being mysterious. I just Didn't want to bore you with the five reasons. Happy to answer questions for the curious.

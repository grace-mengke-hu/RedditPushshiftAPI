Back to Day 1

I ran out of cigarettes last night, and when I woke up this morning I decided fuck it, I'm going to quit. Smoking has been bothering me for some time now. Between my dentist, my mom, my girlfriend, you name it telling me to quit - between my own self-negativity - between the coughing when I play basketball, it was time to give it a solid, college try. I previously quit for over six months using Carr's method, and today I brought my copy to work to skim when I feel a craving. 

Wanted to stop by, write this up for self-therapy, and get some encouragement. Nice to meet you guys

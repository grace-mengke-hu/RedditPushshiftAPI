beginning kinda rough

decided i need to stop now, past two days i smoked a whole pack while studying with a bunch of people for our final, and thats about as bad as its been since I joined the military. Was on a pretty good streak where I really only smoked during weekends but realized that's not a good compromise either. First weeks gonna be rough because smoking is my "transition" activity, between class and the gym and meals. Here i go.

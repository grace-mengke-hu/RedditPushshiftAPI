So. I want to quit smoking. The problem is I don't smoke ... Except when I go out. And I don't know how to quit that.

Hello everyone!  
The title gives a good summary. I don't smoke. I used to, but haven't been a regular smoker in 8, maybe 10 years.  
The thing is, when I go out and drink (which I really like), I smoke. I don't go out often, maybe one night every two weeks. But when I go out, I drink and I smoke.  
It's a habit, the connection between drinking and smoking is very strong, but I also just plainly like it.   
But it's also an addiction, as I can't seem to not do it.
I tried, but I get very frustrated and I get to a point where my mind *only* thinks about smoking, or well, not-smoking, and I find it hard to keep up conversations or just have fun.  
  
As I said, I also like it, I won't lie, but I just want to quit altogether.  
Not smoking 95% of the time isn't enough. Most of my friends have stopped, and I would like to too.  
  
I've been to the doctor, but she said she couldn't help me, as most programs are geared towards regular smokers.  
  
The only solution that worked is not going out, which I did for 6 months (and didn't drink and thus smoke for 6 months).  
But it killed my social life.  
  
So, do you have any tips? Tricks? Experience?

It's a long, hard road

At this point, I have lost count of how many times I have quit and failed. I have been wanting to quit for as long as I can remember. I can't even remember why I decided to start smoking, but I did. Now, less than 15 years later and many failed attempts, I will be successful at quitting. My failures have given me some insight as to what to expect. I got this. Hell, we got this.

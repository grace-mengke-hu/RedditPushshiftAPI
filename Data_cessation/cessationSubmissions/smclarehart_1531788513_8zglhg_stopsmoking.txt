Nicotine... liar.

Hi. I'm writing this post to myself, though I'm sure some of you may relate. I'm on day 9 of my quit. This is my (many times attempt) at quit. I've gone for a long time, sometimes (like when I was pregnant and nursing.\[3x\]) Longest was 5 years. Then 2 years. Those were the longest periods. 

Started my first cigarette age 11. (Back in the day when I could actually GO to a liquor store at age 11 and buy a pack of cigarettes. No questions asked). That pisses me off.

So, one of the things I hear in my head as I quit is "Hey... your friends/family will respect that you tried.. relapse is normal... you can always try again". 

And, yeah, all that is true. But who does that serve? Ummm.. I think it serves BIG TOBACCO. And I think that's about it.

As one poster reminded me.."The solution to the problem is also the cause". That is the formula for addiction. It's a big itch... it sucks... but there is no escape from it other than to stop feeding it!

I've been using EFT tapping to calm my cravings.. has been working pretty well.

Honestly, I'm still on the fence about giving in and making the excuse that "I tried". I'm hugely tempted every moment (especially in the evening) to dig some old butts out of the trash.

I've been smoking for roughly 40 years. My (20 year-old) daughter's dad (ex-husband) passed away this year from Prostate cancer. I want to be here for them as long as I can. Heck, I want to be here for ME and not just here, but HERE in a big way.. where I can be present and contributing to the planet. My addiction has cut my life in half (at least). And I'm not just talking about longevity, I'm talking about participation in LIFE on a day to day basis.

Anyway... thanks for this forum and for letting me share (and ramble on). I keep moving forward and I pray for all of us to get out from under the thumb of that "F\*\*king Nicotine Beast"!!

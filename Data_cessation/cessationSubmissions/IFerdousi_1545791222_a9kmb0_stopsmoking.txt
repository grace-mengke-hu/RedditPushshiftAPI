CoCare

Hi All,  
Hope you are having a joyful Christmas. I am Ishita, currently a student at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia, USA. I am working on an app called [CoCare](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlpv-8knosA&amp;t=1s) for family caregivers of patients with COPD. If you could have a look and let me know what you think about the features, it would be very enlightening and helpful for me. Its an youtube link:

Looking forward to hear a lot from you.   
Cheers!

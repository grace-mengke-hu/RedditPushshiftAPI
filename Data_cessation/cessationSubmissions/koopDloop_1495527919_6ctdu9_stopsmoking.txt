Close to a year but caved...well as close to it as you could get.

So im a couple weeks away from a year of quitting but suddenly suffering from insane cravings for nicotine. Thinking back, it may be a stupid decision to hold onto my vape from when I used it to curb this disgusting habit. But whenever I see it, it reminds me of the progresss I've made. I've been completely nicotine free for the period of a year, apart from ~two weeks of vaping to kickstart my quit. But this random craving tonight snuck up on me fast and hard. I literally held my vape up to my mouth for a second, then up to my nose to just smell it, back to my mouth and finally put it back down. I thankfully resisted but this has utterly caught me off guard. I've had such confidence in my quit but now im not so sure. This serves as a reminder that no matter where you are in your quit, always be wary of slips and relapses. Sorry for the rant. Any and all advice, personal experiences, or support would be very much appreciated. Thanks for listening.

Smoking with a nicotine patch on

Hi all, I’m 3 days into quitting and the nicotine patches I bought are great but I was starting to get really restless and decided to go for a quick smoke. This is the first one I’ve had in 3 days and haven’t felt the need to have one until just now. I read online from various sources that the combination of a patch and a cigarette can cause an overdose but just as many sources said that there wasn’t a problem with this. Is there anything I should do here or have to worry about?

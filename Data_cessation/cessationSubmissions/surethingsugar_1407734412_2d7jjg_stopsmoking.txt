Well shoot. I'm having my first real craving/ need. And I have cigarettes in my car.

Ahhhhhh crap. This is the longest I've gone in about 7+ years. I totally feel like THIS IS IT.

**I QUIT** and nothing is going to make me ever start again!!!!!

But.

I'm having a super crappy, lonely day and got some stressful crappy news tonight. I'm stuck in my head and really down.

I quit smoking when my e-cig arrived in the mail. I still have a few smokes left in my car... I really *really* **REALLY** want to go get them.

I've sort of given myself permission to finish the pack if I ever "needed" to but... I don't think I'll feel very good about myself if I do.

But they are there.

And I really want to.

I need a hug :(

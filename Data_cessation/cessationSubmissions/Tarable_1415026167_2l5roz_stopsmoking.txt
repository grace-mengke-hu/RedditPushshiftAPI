I'm a star!!!!

Never thought I'd be here.  Looking back after 30 days, it's dawned on me that is really has gotten a lot easier.  Cravings still happen every now and then, but if I distract myself for the 3-5 minutes, it passes.  

I began running along with stopping smoking.  After reading some more articles on the benefits of quitting smoking (I like to do this as reinforcement), it was then that I realized the muscle spasms in my legs after running is due to the oxygen returning to my body.  My body is not used to having so much oxygen!  I thought that was pretty cool.  I also learned that the many headaches I have endured is also due to oxygen surge.  

It's awesome to realize these side effects equal something positive.  It's telling you that your body is fixing itself and is getting back to normal.

Many thanks to all of you for your support and kindness.  This subreddit has been a godsend.

Edit to add:  Never knew canker sores/mouth ulcers were a side effect of quitting.  Holy crap it hurts.

I know it's not smoking but

In 36 minutes I will be dip-free for 20 days. That is 480 hours without tobacco or 28,800 minutes. I have saved around $42.67 so far (a can every day and a half).

I am aware that there is a no dipping subreddit, but hardly anyone posts on there. So here I am.



Here's to another 20 days.

Has anyone used Wellbutrin to stop smoking for good?

I have been smoking for longer than I want to admit.  I quit once for five years and then earlier this years I quit for three months.

The problem is that I don't really know why I smoke.  On the one hand, it is pleasurable but on the other hand I know it is killing me.  However, I continue to do it and, even when I quit for five years, it was an almost daily feeling of I want a cigarette.

So, now at the suggestion of my doctor, I am considering Wellbutrin.  Has anyone tried this?  Did you have good results?  My main concern is about the psychological effects since it is an anti-depressant and I have never had the need to be on one.

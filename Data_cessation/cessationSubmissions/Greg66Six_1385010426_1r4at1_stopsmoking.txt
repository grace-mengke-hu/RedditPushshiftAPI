Does Laser treatment work?

Hi there;

I'm considering laser treatment to help with quitting smoking. Has anyone tried this, and what were your results? Internet research gave me mixed reviews, so I figured I would come to Reddit! Thanks for your help!

( sorry if this has been asked a million times before; there was no FAQ or anything in the sidebar. )

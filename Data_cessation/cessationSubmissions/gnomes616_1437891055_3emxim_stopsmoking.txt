One year down, about 45 minutes ago. I couldn't be happier!

After smoking for 10 years, I couldn't ever imagine giving it up. I was terrified that I'd be one of those moms smoking around their babies or worse, while pregnant. When I quit last year, it was a rough start. My poor husband! Then he quit a month later, and I was more level headed to help him. Spare the thought if we'd had to quit at the same time..

A year on, I can't remember what it felt like to wake up with my lungs feeling bogged down every morning. I can't remember the tightness in my chest, or how miserable just one flight of stairs used to be (and how embarrassing to get winded in ones own home!). I started running, and I've started eating better now that I can (kind of) taste flavors. I sleep better, as well as an insomniac can. I'm more focused at work. I smell better. I can hang out endlessly with my best friend and her boyfriend who is allergic to smoke.

I hope everyone trying to quit, or who has quit, keeps their resolve and remembers that every craving, annoyance, stress, and moment of weakness are only temporary. And all the people who relapse will remind you it's not worth it!!

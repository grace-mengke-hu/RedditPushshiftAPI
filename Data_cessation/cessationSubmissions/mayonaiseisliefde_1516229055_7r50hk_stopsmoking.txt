Day 8, three days without patches but still using my vaper (and a very weird question to all of you...)

It feels like i am cheating my quitingprocess but until now, my cravings are down to a minimum. I allready got rid of the patches. And when it comes to vaping, i dont smoke over 1.6 ml a day (6% nicotine), so that is not even that much!

Things are going pretty smooth, i noticed i smell more and i taste way more! 

An other thing i noticed as well sounds a little odd. Since a couple of days my farts disgust me. They smell just awefull! Is that normal after quitting?

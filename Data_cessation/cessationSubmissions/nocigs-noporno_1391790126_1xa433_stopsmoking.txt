How am i suppose to quite again? I want to but i don't.

I quite before for four months.  I read easy way and it work as it said it would.  The stress just got the better of me and i had the one cig.  Now i've been back at it for three months, full swing.  I want to stop but just can't bring my self to put in the effort.  I really need to but i really dont want to.  It eats away all my money.  Im broke bc of smoking.

Sixty days of healing

I gotta say, I'm really proud of how I've handled things so far. There have been trying times but thanks to the inspiration I get from this sub, I've been able to pull through.

There are even days when I don't think about cigarettes at all. It helps that I'm really busy.

As a tip for those who spend a lot of time on reddit, unsubscribe from this subreddit. It depends on you I guess, but for me, I was constantly reminded of smoking because of the posts I would see from here, so I just unsubbed and made a habit of coming here manually whenever I felt an urge. 

Stay strong everyone.

Mouth sores a month after quitting?

About a week ago i developed a couple..I don't know what exactly to call them..basically canker sores on my lips. I was very relived to learn that this isn't uncommon for people who have quit. 2 of them of them are pretty severe and are being a bit of a nightmare, making sleeping even harder than it is and eating difficult. They're healing, but very slowly. Thankfully holding cold water on them helps temporarily. Has anyone else experienced this? What did you find to be the best treatment/solution? Thanks! :)

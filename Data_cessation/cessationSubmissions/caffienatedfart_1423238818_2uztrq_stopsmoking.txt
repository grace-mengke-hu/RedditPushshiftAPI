And gentlement it has been three weeks!!! Three motherhuggin' weeks since I have been free of tobacco. It feels so good, it is unbelievable. I have never been more proud of myself than now :). I mean it might sound pathetic that I've never been more proud than when I escaped smoking, but heck if I care :). I have literally forgotten what it feels like to smoke. Cigarette smoke now smells just nasty. 
Thanks gentlemen and ladies for your encouragement and whatnot. It has been awesome :D. I love you guys and gals...I am now planning to use this momentum to quit other negative aspects of my life. Happiness (the pursuit of) and health is my right, as it is yours :)

A whole month without a cigarette!

Hello /r/stopsmoking! I want to thank you all for being such an inspiration for me. I'm 21, smoked since I was 16. I never allowed myself to get anything near a pack a day, but I was going through 1-2 packs a week and that was enough to get on my nerves.

I decided enough was enough, and it was better to quit while I'm young. I quit cold turkey, no gum or anything. Thankfully the withdrawing has stopped. That was really brutal for a while. The cravings, on the other hand, have not stopped. I really hope those start to go away soon. I truly never thought this day would come, though, and it feels absolutely great.

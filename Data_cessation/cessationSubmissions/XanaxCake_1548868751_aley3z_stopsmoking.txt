I Want to Quit. But Dont Know How

Ever since trying ciggarretes I've found them as a solution to relax and sometimes forget my surroundings and the stress of life.  I went from smoking a ciggarrete at night, hidden from my own mother and grandmother, to smoking up to 2 boxes a day without any fear of the consequences and my loved one's approval. I am only 19 years of age, I feel like I cannot do much of what I used to. When cousins invite me to the park or overall activities that involve movement I tend to get tired faster than what I used to remember. It's certainly something that I'm slowly starting to realize it's bad for my life. I've spent thousands of dollars on Juul pods and ciggarretes. I've always wanted to buy a computer to finally play games but I have never been able to save money due to my addiction, I consider my dream to be burried 6ft beneath the earth nowadays. At home I have to deal with the gossip and talk behind my back due to my addiction. But I cant just find something that will grant me that smoking does. Usually I wake up depressed and rather tired of everything  but as soon as I light one up my happiness seems to be regained. I just wish there was some other ways to achieve this happiness that I seek. It is certainly degrading my life, I'm tired of it, and I wish I could just stop, but the urges keep coming and I just keep landing in the same hole. Please help.

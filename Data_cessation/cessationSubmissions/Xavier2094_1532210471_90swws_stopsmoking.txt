I want to quit cold turkey. How did you do it?

Did you make sure you have a couple days off so you can lay around the house miserable or do something to preoccupy your mind? Or did you go to work during the withdrawal? Also, did you plan a week in advance? Or did you just say "fuck it" and stop smoking on the spot?

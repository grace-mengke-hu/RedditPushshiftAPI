Today someone died

  It was a wife and a mother of 3. Aunt of a friend of mine, who called me an hour ago, crying because her aunt and friend died just minutes before, at 33 years old.

  The worst part for me was to listen and try to confort a little innocent girl, telling me her aunt already knew this was going to happen. Telling me that "she had smoked since she was 15... we all knew she wasn't gonna live a long life, but she was so nice to everyone.. she didn't even get to know how much the family loved her and I didn't think she was gonna leave this soon... she didn't look bad at all last week... but as soon as the news reached us we only had some days to say our goodbyes"

  This woman suffered an COPD and fell into a comma in matter of 3-4 days. From comma to death it took only 10 hours. The girl that cried on me couldn't even say her goodbyes and right now she is writting a letter with all the things she wish she had told her when her aunt was alive.

  I am not personally close to this death and I may not have the most accurate info about this case... but one thing is for sure: a week ago nobody would have expected her to leave us today, I am sure not even herself. 

  Stop smoking. Now. You are risking your life and the happiness of the people that loves you. Stop burning years of your life and go hug all the smokers you love because you will not expect the moment their health vanishes. You are hurting yourself just to smell like shit. Good job. I'm sure men/women love the smell of smoke better than perfume smelling people.

  Don't wait until you are in a hospital bed, surrounded by the people you love to share time with them. Because at that point the time you have will be limited. And there's nothing you will be able to do about it.

Stop. Smoking.

(sorry for the ranty badly organized writting and the broken english... I just had to write this down somewhere and I thought this could help someone stop being a senseless smoker so... there you have it)

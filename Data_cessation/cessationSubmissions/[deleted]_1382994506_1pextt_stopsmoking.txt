Short-term anxiety relief

Dear Friends,

I've been repeatedly trying to quit cold-turkey for several months now.  My only real symptoms are headaches (easily dealt with), irritability (I have a loving home and office that deals with me), and increased anxiety.  The third, though, feels impossible.  I usually get into the 3rd night, then get slammed with a massive panic attack.  I'm trying the patch now, about halfway through, but I'm dreading the inevitable withdrawal at the end of it.  The problem is it's not a little voice saying "you need a cigarette", it's more along the lines of "one day you will inevitably die, and there's nothing you can do about it nor any guarantees about what lies on the other side."  It's not a craving. It's pure terror, in a way I've never felt before.  It puts me into hysterics every time and the only way I know to get through it is to have a smoke and calm down.

Does anyone know of fast-acting short-term anxiety relief available without a prescription?  (As mentioned, I don't HAVE anxiety, this is only 48-72 hours after going cold-turkey).  I feel like if I can get past the terrors for a couple of nights, everything else has gone swimmingly.

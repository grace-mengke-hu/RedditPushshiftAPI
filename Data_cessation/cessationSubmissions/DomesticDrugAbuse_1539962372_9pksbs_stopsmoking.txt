Today’s the day. .

If I had a dollar for every time I said that. But I really feel like today’s the day. I don’t feel an urge or need to quit but I know something needs to change. I’m sure I don’t even recognize how bad cigarettes are really, but something has to change. 

I work in a disease ridden, old as hell mill where people are constantly depressed and sick of life. Where people are constantly escaping into their phones first chance they get and smoking away the little bit of life they have left that the chemicals and work here didn’t kill. 

 I live in a drug infested, dead-end town where everybody is smoking or taking something. Everyone is sick and tired of the same shit and even the most professional people here have terrible advice. Where businesses die because of dumbass bosses and not even the best employee could save it.

I feel like I live in hell and something has to change before I’m just as complacent as everyone else. So today marks the last day.
Today marks the last today is today. TODAY IS THE DAY. And I look forward to a week from now when I can log in and tell you guys how it the first week went for me, because the fourth day is alway my breaking point. Except this time. Thanks you all so much for sharing your stories alongside people I actually know. Smoking isn’t ok, and we can all be ok without it. Thank you. I’m hoping this also marks the beginning of me getting out this place to pursue an actual career and actual life somewhere else, but no one knows what the future holds . Once again, thank you guys.

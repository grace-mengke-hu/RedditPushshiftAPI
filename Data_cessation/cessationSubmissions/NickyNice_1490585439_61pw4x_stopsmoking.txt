Questions about quitting using patches.

I am looking for somebody who has ~~successfully~~ tried quitting using patches.
  
I had been smoking for 8 years and typically smoke 10-15 a day. According to the packaging I should use the patches accordingly: weeks 1-4 21mg, 5-6 14mg, and 7-8 7mg patches.

I'm on day 31 currently, and things are going well so far. I do realize that I am still physically addicted to nicotine though and I'm just wondering what I should be preparing for once I'm off the patches.
  
How long after my last 7mg patch until the nicotine is completely out of my body? Are there any physical withdrawal symptoms I should prepare for? Are the withdrawals weakened since there is less nicotine in my body than if I quit cold turkey?

Any advice or info is appreciated.

Reached 4 days then gave in

Hi, ive been a smoker for around 8 years. 

Attempted stopping countless times at different points. Most recently i stopped 4 days ago and really struggled with withdrawal symptoms; foggyness, irritability and so on. It sounds strange but reality felt different. After 3 days i was happy to know nicotine was out of my system but on the 4th day (today) i slipped up and bought a pack. 

As expected the immediate regret sunk in, the smell, the disappointment not only for myself but for the people that hope for me to quit. I repeatedly looked at this sub and found comfort at times cravings set in but my impulse got the better of me. 

I wasted the money on buying them and would feel even more stupid just throwing them away but i feel like im just enabling myself to smoke them. 

Im not sure what to expect by posting this, maybe im just venting where i feel i wont be judged. Not to mention, i just suffered those withdrawal symptoms for nothing...while i anticipate going through it again

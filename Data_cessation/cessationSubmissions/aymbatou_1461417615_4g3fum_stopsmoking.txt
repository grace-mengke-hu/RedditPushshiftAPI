Quitted 5 days ago. Fuck, I never thought I'd make it!

Hi guys, just discovered this sub! 

I was a smoker for 10 years, or maybe more. I'm 27 since the 6 of april. I was smoking 20-30 cigs a day. Seriously addicted. And I quitted 5 days ago. I tried many, many, many times over the years, but I couldn't do it, as I was not seriously motivated. I'm asmathic and all pulmonologists have told me to never begin when I was a kid, and to stop immediately more recently.

My biggest issue for quitting over the years? Parties, friends, terrasses, and alcool. But this is it. 2 days ago, I was on my 3rd day of quitting, and I was at a big party, the "first one". Everyone was smoking. I knew no one there. Usually, I think I'd smoked 30 or more cigs, but this time, I resisted, all night. And I made it. The party was shit, okay, but it would have been shit with cigarettes too. Probably more shitty. So I'll now let it this way : I'm not a smoker anymore. I'm so fucking proud. Sorry to say it like that! But, seriously, I feel so much better, and I want to keep going, I want to stay strong. As I said, as an asthmatic, smoking was the best way for me to die quickly. But I don't want to. I tought it was clearly impossible for me to do it, but thinking seriously of my health changed everything. And fuck that, I do not want to supply companies that poison us anymore. Fuck them for killing us. 

Sorry, I have no moral to do or anything else to say. I just wanted to tell people, because I don't have many friends that could understand, and my family does not really care. Have a nice day!

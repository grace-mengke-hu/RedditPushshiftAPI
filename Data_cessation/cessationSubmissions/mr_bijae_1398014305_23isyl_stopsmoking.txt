Happy 4/20... & 364!!!

To all of you out there on day 1, hang in there. The cravings pass and the desire fades. When you're ready it's not that hard!! okay there are days when you want to light anything just to inhale the smoke, but hang tough, those will fade. I never thought I'd make it a week and now I'm at the 1 year mark. 

Holy crap!!! A year!! WOW!!

One step at a time, and you will be here too!

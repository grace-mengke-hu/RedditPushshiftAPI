So much trouble!

My life just grinds to a halt when I cease smoking. 

Can't work, can't study, I become angry and snap at my partner. 
I can't function, can't do housework...just want to stay in bed and cry.

I've tried guided hypnosis / meditation, patches...haven't read Allan Carr yet but I should try.

I need to be locked away in a padded cell for 2 weeks or something. 

I absolutely must quit smoking, even if I die next week, I want to die a non-smoker. ><

Literally coughing right now. errgh!!!

I messed up :/

I got to 2 weeks without one, then I got drunk on a weekend, bummed one off a random person. Tried to justify it to myself by saying I was just drunk but then today, about 5 days after that I had another one sober. I've gotten out of the habit I used to have, instead of 7 a day I've had 2 in the last 3 weeks, but I still feel like I've failed myself. Worst part was it wasn't even remotely worth it, barely tasted like anything. I'm gonna keep trying again, but I just feel like the best I can do now is just not get back into my old habits, haven't bought another pack yet and don't plan to but I don't know how well this cold turkey thing will work. I feel awful.

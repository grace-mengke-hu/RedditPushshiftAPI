Just failed

I'm writing this post whilst good and drunk. I've had about fiftteen cigs tonight after quitting since monday lunchtime. After all my friends have gone now I feel like an enormous failure. Does anyone have any good ideas about staying off the smokes while drinking? I allready have an E-cigarrete and nicotine spray, but the spray nearly always makes me throw up. Sorry about the grammar and the spelling, this is posted from my phone.

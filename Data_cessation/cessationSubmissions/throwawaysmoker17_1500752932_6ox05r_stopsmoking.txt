3 weeks away from being the first in my family to go to college and I am NOT smoking today

I'm 17 and I had my first cigarette 3 years ago and have been smoking about 3-5 a day since last summer. I'm leaving for college next month and will be the first one in my family (youngest of 4 siblings) to go.

Smoking is pretty common in my hometown and at the school I'm going to and because I tell myself I didn't smoke "that much" I had just assumed I would keep smoking at school and quit sometime in my 20's before I had a family.

For whatever reason while I was having my after-work smoke last night it dawned on me what a total load of bullshit that was. I get nothing out of cigarettes besides a rush that lasts for 10 minutes and I'm voluntarily choosing to give hundreds of dollars a year to corporate America so that I can slowly poison myself.

Finished that cig, tossed the pack, and now I'm going on 18 hours in.

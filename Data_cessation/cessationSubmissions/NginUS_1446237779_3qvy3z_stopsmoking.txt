Back At It Again

I didn't really want to quit, but I had run out of smokes & felt I may as well quit. However it didn't stop me from bumming, which eventually resulted in my buying another pack. I keep putting off my quit date, don't know if I'll ever have the strength to try again.  Feeling hopeless.

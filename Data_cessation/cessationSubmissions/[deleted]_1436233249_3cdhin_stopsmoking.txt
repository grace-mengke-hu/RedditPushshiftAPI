Someone is coming over to argue about something tonight and I have to follow my own advice and not smoke.

Posting this here to keep me strong. I'm angry, I'm stressed and I might yell tonight.. but im not smoking because fuck that, it's not worth it.

But god this is the first trigger I've felt in weeks. Just typing this helped though.

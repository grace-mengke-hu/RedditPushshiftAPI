My job is going to make this impossibe

I decided to stop smoking early yesterday, as it's my two days off from work and I wanted to avoid the stress at the beginning.

I'm a croupier and our breaks work 1 hour on 15 minutes off. With some break changes we end up with six or seven 15 minute breaks per shift. By the time I'm in the break area I have about 10 minutes which has been my smoke and coffee break and this has been my routine for nearly a year.

Has anyone been in a similar situation? I have no idea what to do for 6*15 minutes per shift except for think about and tempting myself to smoke.

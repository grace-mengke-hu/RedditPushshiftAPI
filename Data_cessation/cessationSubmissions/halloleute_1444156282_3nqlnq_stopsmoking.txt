33 days and still feeling great

I sometimes still can't believe I quit.  I'm 27 years old and have been smoking since 14.  My quality of life has increased so much.  Taste is better, smell is better, my SO is happier, *I'm* happier and I've saved almost 200 bucks.  I rarely have strong cravings anymore and the smell of cigarettes actually sort of grosses me out now.  

Reading everyone's stories and tips on this subreddit has been very beneficial and I hope you all succeed too.  Keep at it folks.

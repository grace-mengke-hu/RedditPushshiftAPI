Need advice, quit approx. 1000times never succeed

A year ago I successfully quit for a year. Then I lived with someone who smoked a lot. Like the first thing he would do when waking up was lighting one up. And it made me think he HAD to enjoy it. So I started smoking again. The first cigarette did NOTHING. But I got nicotine in my body again and slowly started started smoking up to a pack a day.

I've read all the books about quitting smoking (including Allen carr's). I tried switching to electronic cigarettes. And at first it actually works. But usually around day 1-3 I cave in .

I tried talking myself into that I don't need smoking. But the high I get makes me start again

I think my problem is that I don't believe it on an emotional level. Sure, logically it all makes sense but do you know what I mean?  at some point in my quit I just ignore all logic and want to feel good for a moment. 

After I get my high I feel regret and say to myself that I will quit again tomorrow. This has been going on for weeks. Everyday I start a new quit to the point where quitting lost its meaning.

I know it's pathetic but that's how it is 

Any advice?

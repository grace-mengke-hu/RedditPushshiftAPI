Uncontrollable sneezing fits

I have been smoking for about 5 years and around the time I took up the habit I also started getting these sneezing fits. Mostly in the morning or sometimes just randomely during the day i'll just start sneezing 10-15 times in a row, it could last for a few minutes and by the time it passes, my eyes are watering and bloodshot, my throat is soar and people around me are standing awkwardly thinking how many times they should say "bless you".

Now that I have not smoked in over 3 days, i noticed the sneezing is slowly going away, i always knew that it was somehow related but was never sure, because none of the smokers i know have experienced anything similar. So I was just wondering how common this kind of side effect is. Have you guys known of any similar cases?

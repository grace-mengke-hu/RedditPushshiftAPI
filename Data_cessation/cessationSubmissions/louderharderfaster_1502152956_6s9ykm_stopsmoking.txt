66 days!

I still can't believe I am a nonsmoker but then again it's like I never smoked... I was just on the phone with a pal and I heard her inhale as she lit a cigarette and it was so FOREIGN to me. I counted the days and realized it has been over two months... wow.

The first ten days were so hard but for the first time (this last quit) I had it in my head that my future self would be so grateful if I quit and... I am. I also started meditating every day this time around so I bet that has a lot to do with it. 

My skin is brighter, my lungs don't ache, my clothes don't reek, I've saved all that money and it is now effortless. If you are struggling right now just KNOW that it does, it really does get easier and better!

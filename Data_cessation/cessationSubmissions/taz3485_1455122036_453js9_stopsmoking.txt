Need some help.

So I'm active duty Navy, and as stressful as being in the military is, I thought I would try to quit to improve my health. I quit for two days, and now I'm back smoking again, and now I'm kicking myself for starting back. I realize that only I can help myself quit, but some pointers will hopefully help with me quitting permanently

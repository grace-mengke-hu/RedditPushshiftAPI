Day 9... Just worried about when I have my first drink

So I quit smoking 9 days ago and have been smoking since 2003 about 10 cigarettes per day (less a few years ago). 

I'm just really worried about when I have a few drinks this weekend with friends (I purposely stopped drinking for a bit to help with quitting) but I have a wedding to attend this coming weekend and will surely have a few drinks. Does anybody else get crazy strong cravings after a drink or two? What do you do to stop those cravings?

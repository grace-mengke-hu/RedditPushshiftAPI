I want to quit. I'm scared.

 I'm sick of worry about my health. I keep telling myself I will quit, only to wake up and say "I'll do it tomorrow/next week/etc".  I've smoked for 15 years.  I am 30 now.  I have a fiancee and she has told me she doesn't want to have kids with me until I quit.  I have all the reasons to quit, but I am just not doing it.  I try and cut back, but it doesn't work that well especially because I live by myself now.  When I am with my woman I can cut down to 4 a day, when I am by myself it's like 10-15.    

I quit a few months ago for over a week until I caved.  I got a ton of nicotine gum right now.  Because the last time I quit cold turkey and I was a mess.  I think that's why I am scared.  I suffer from panic attacks and anxiety and when I quit last time I was a nervous wreck.  I'm just looking for support.  I really, really want to quit.  And not next week.  Not next month.  I want to do this now.  Any advice?  Tips?  Do I just man up and throw the damn things out?  What worked for you?

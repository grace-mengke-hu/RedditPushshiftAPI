Halfway thru day 5, new here.

Hi,  I'm 30yr old female from NJ.  I have been trying to quit for what seems like years and years.  I had tried patches,  gum,  and chantix (which was working but made me feel weird so I stopped it)..
I started smoking when I was 16. I quit for awhile while in the Army but then started again.  (stupid!)  unfortunately I even smoked when I was pregnant with my son in 2003. Ciggs were a crutch and staple for everything in my life. 

I'm now pregnant again (11yrs apart) and I just up and decided I was going to quit, cold turkey. No delaying nicotine withdrawal.  I woke up on Memorial Day and haven't smoked since the night before.  108 hours smoker free.

I thought this should be tougher,  but I guess I never put much effort into it in the past.  Don't get me wrong,  cravings come hard, and my restless legs have gotten worse..  But it's not been hell. The worst part seems to have past,  I was not sleeping,  sweats,  chills on days 2-4.. But I actually slept last night.  I hope it keeps going this way.

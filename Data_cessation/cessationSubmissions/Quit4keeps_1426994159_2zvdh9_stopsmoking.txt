First day

Hey all. This is my first day quitting the habit. 
I have been smoking since I was 20 when I moved in with a group of smokers during university. I am now 29 and my wife has just had a beautiful baby girl. The reality has hit me in this past month. I want to see this beautiful girl grow up and having been a pack a day smoker for the last nearly 10 years I know that may not happen.

I am literally terrified now and can't stand the thought of not being there to see my girl grow up. So I made the decision to quit. 

I'm here for help and support! I live in China where smoking is still pretty much the norm. There is temptation everywhere. Being the boss of an english school does not help either as the first thing bosses generally do in meetings is offer each other cigarettes. 

But I hold onto the reason I'm quitting which is my daughter and will politely refuse every offer I get. 

Any tips/support welcome thank.

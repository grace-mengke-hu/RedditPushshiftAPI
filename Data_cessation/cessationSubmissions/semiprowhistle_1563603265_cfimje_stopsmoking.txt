Humor changes?

Hi all friends. First of all really Thnks averyone in this sub for the help and motivation. Second sorry for my English. And third, time to time my humor change like hell. Get really mad, I pist off people who don’t deserve and I’m a really peaceful guy, but the cold turkey might give me this change humor.

This is another reason for not smoking, I don’t want to arrive again to this feeling.

My best wishes buddys

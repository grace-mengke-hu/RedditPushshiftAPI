Just hit a month, and I feel great for it!

Honestly, I didn't know that it would this... easy. I know that it sounds strange, but I've just not been in the kind of situation where I would have a cigarette. Usually, it would be on a night out drinking, but I've been avoiding those, and since I'm at university right now, I just don't associate this location with smoking!

It's a very helpful way, though I don't quite know how I'll fare when I go back home this weekend, where I usually bum a smoke from my dad or two... Here's hoping I'll be strong!

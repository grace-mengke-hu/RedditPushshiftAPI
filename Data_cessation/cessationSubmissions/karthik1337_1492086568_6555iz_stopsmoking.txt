How good is this theory to just smoke when you've had a couple of drinks?

I have gone cold turkey for 3 weeks, it feels great clearing the gunk out if my lungs and I definitely do better at the gym. The only mega cravings I feel are when I have a couple of drinks, it makes it really hard to resist a cigarette. So I've spoken to a couple my friends who just smoke when they drink and I want to be one of them, at least for the time being, anybody here with similar habits? Does it work?

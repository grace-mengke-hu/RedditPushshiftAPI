No more inspiration needed,

The way I smell 
My yellow teeth
Dependency 
All this money 
My health
What a terrible mistake I made
No more inspiration 
I'm sorry i never listened 
I want to quit 
Everyone of us is trapped by nicotine 
So many cowboys have been killed 
Overflowing ash trays 
I need one more, screw it I'll get a pack,
Why not 2? 
I'm going to be 40 and in my throat there is going to be tube 
Good luck, but I know you can't quit. 
But prove me wrong because I don't want to be right 

I'm quitting today after a pack a day for the past 3-4 years I'm done, my body can't handle the toxins

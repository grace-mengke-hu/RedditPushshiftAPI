Don't make stupid trigger decisions. How do you handle drinking and social smoking? Any coping methods?

When it comes to your first week, its a good idea to stay far away from your biggest triggers if avoidable. Drinking heavily. Going on smoke breaks with friends to "hangout". Any avoidable stressful scenario really.

Ever since day three I've been coasting. More thoughts of cigarettes, Less real cravings. Each day and cravings are getting much more manageable than the previous.

I made the mistake of throwing myself into two of my biggest triggers. Adderall and Drinking. I took an adderall to finish some work and, after a productive day, decided to grab beers with friends.

Wow! Major craving. Not your typical three minute ones. I haven't been able to really get them off my mind so I came to you guys. I'm not tempted to buy but keep thinking how great that damn cancer stick would be right now.

I'm a bit scared of the future due to this. The social drunken cigarette is my biggest threat and enemy this next year.

How do you combat the social drunk cigarette? I need coping strategies.

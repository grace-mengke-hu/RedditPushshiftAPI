How heavily addicted were you?

How did you find quitting nicotine as a half pack a day smoker vs a 3 pack a day smoker. Personally I’m still trying to quit. I smoked atleast a pack and chewed half a can of dip per day, every day. I’ve stopped chewing for now but am up to probably a pack and a half of darts. Can’t seem to find a way to stop..

1 month smoke free as of today.

I've been smoking since I was in high school (~10 years) but after an event that occurred in late March I decided that it was finally time. Didn't think it was possiblem but I really owe it to the Smoke Free app on my phone which helped out tremendously.

Since then, have never felt so healthy in my life and no longer have any cravings, in fact just the mere sight of a cigarette makes me queasy now.

Just wanted to say that to everyone that finds quitting difficult, it's not impossible, and above all else, believe in yourself to get through the worst of it.

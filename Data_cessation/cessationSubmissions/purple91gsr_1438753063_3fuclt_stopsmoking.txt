Vaping lead me to quit, and it was easy, yes, easy.

So I unsubbed from here a year or so ago, after another failed quit attempt, the guilt of seeing all the posts was too much. 

Recently I discovered vaping, with a little help from the guys at r/electronic_cigarette and r/Aussievapers I picked out a setup, and ordered some juice. In the two weeks I had to wait for my juice to ship (no nicotine juice in Australia) somthing weird happened.... I was getting EXCITED. For the first time ever, I was exited to quit, and that juice couldn't come fast enough! 

The delivery came first thing in the morning, I ran downstairs, filled up my clearo, and I had quit. Just like that, no morning smoke, didn't even consider it.

It's now been just over a month, and I've not had a single drag, despite holding on to a full pack I could have opened at any time. It was my birthday over the weekend, and drinking (I usually don't drink) tempted me pretty bad, but I just vaped through it. 

After 15 years of 20+ a day, my time had come. Yes, I'm still addicted to nicotine, but I have already cut down from 12mg/ml to 6mg/ml, and I don't feel anywhere near as reliant on my vape as I did on cigarettes. And yes, there are risks with vaping, but hey, they are absolutely miniscule compared to smoking! 

TL;DR: got excited about vaping, quitting has never been this easy.

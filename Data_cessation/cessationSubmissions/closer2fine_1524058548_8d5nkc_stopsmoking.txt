Last cigarette this morning

I quit drinking 18 days ago, and at the same time threw my vape in the trash. Trying to go cold-turkey off both alcohol and nicotine at once was killer and I ended up having bought two packs of cigarettes since then (the most I'll smoke in a day ever is like 5). Today I smoked the last cigarette in my second pack and I am DONE.  Hope that this community will be as helpful and supportive as /stopdrinking has been. Thanks all.

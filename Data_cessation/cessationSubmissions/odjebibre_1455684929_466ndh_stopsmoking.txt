One week today - I would kill for a Lucky

Or a Marlboro Red, even a Marlboro Light

Thankfully they don't sell those here and I only have Canadian cigarettes I can buy without driving for an hour and a half.

Someone please tell me some stories about how it gets better or some crap. I dreamt about Luckies last night and have literally been scared to leave my apartment knowing I'd be tempted.

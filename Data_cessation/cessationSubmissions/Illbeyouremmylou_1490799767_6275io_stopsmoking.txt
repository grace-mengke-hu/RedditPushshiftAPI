I'm slippin'

Hi guys,
I started off strong. I was going to swimming & yoga.. I felt great. The past three weeks I've just been feeling off. I don't have any motivation to go to any activities, I don't want to be around people.. I feel like I'm mourning the loss of cigarettes. How can I turn this around? I really don't want to smoke again, but I don't like this empty, sad feeling I have. Logically, I know smoking doesn't change this feeling and only serves as a distraction or temporary "fuck you" to life.. but it did provide me with a bit of relief. I would really rather not go on medication, I have been on it before but I want to feel life and learn how to be happy without any crutches (I don't feel I'm clinically depressed, and am not judging any who require medication) 
Can any of you relate? Any suggestions are appreciated! 

Side note: I've also been quitting drinking for the past year, another long time vice

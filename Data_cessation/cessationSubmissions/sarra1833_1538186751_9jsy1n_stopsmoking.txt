First day nearly done..

At midnight it'll be 24 hours. Aside from the Nic demon (aka my inner addict voice) begging me to light up, it's been fine. I do know the next few days could suck. I'm drinking 100% juice and it definitely stops my exhaustion that comes on and gives energy plus keeps me smiling for real.

I AM using a vape mod, sub ohm, big baby beast tank. I used 12mg juice today and a few hours ago mixed 6mg with it. I was using 6mg Nic juice while I was still smoking so I figured it'd not help so the 12 mg Nic juice was it. It Def helped big time and I'll keep using it for the next few days. Goal is 0 Nic.

So far I'm in a great mood (it was helped by my stocks deciding to shoot up, making me 864 dollars today in profit alone. Figuring I take home 309 a week from my work checks, getting paid today from work AND "2 more checks" from stocks is kick butt. Figured it's karma kissing me for quitting lol. Plus I just signed up for aflac so trading cigs for a safety net if needed seems a killer trade.

I'll keep saying "One puff is too much and a thousand is never enough". And I'll keep in mind ALWAYS that "I'm a cigarette addict and I am forever one puff away from a pack a day".

I'll never take another puff.

Oh, everyone I know smokes so I was around it all day. My bf smokes. I prefer being around smokers. It both calms me AND once the smell goes bad it'll also repel me. I rolled two cigs for a neighbor after work today and it didn't even phase me.

I have a feeling kicking this pack a day for 26 year drug addiction wont be as brutal as I thought. It's just that inner voice that's annoyingly Nutballs. I just tell it to "stfu. I don't smoke".

I'm happy about today. And tomorrow I get rare overtime at work so there's more positive.

I'm sure if I get all nasty feeling and a strong crave (I'm only human), I'll be posting here. I love how supportive every one is to everyone else and thats a huge help.

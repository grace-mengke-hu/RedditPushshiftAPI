Hate if you want, I'll keep vaping

Got a vape yesterday, and finally learned how to properly inhale the damn things. I love it. Here's to day 2!

And for those questioning the safety of vapor: imagine your child is a completely hopeless alcoholic. Like they show up everywhere with a fountain cup with booze in it. One day they find that straight sweet tea somehow fills that void and satisfies their cravings. So now they've always got a jug of sweet tea they're sipping out of. And the first words out of your mouth are "well, you know, there's no way that much sugar is good for you."

Good luck to all, however you do it. And here's to optimistically beginning day 2!

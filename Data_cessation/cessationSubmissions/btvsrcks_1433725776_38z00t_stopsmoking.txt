100 days and counting!

I just wanted to thank you all for pointing me to Allen Carr.  Seriously.  I am 100 days clean and feeling wonderful.  My phlegm problem is GONE.  I can breathe again!  And now that the hot weather has returned, I am not suffocating outside in it, instead I am enjoying the AC. :)

I still smoke a little pot now and then, but the cigarettes are long gone and I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for this subreddit.  Thank you so much. <3

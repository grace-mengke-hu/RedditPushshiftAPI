Need some encouragement

Hey everyone! I posted on this sub a couple weeks ago about how I planned on quitting. I got a lot of tips from some really supportive people, one of which was nicotine lozenges. And let me tell you, those helped A LOT. So thank you guys for all the advice.

My latest update: I was doing really really well for about a week. Like, 3-4 cigs a day as opposed to the usual 20. I was excited that those 3-4 cigs didn’t even taste good anymore, I guess that was because I wasn’t smoking as often because I was using the lozenges instead.

Anyway, work has been stressful lately so I unfortunately started back up and am almost back to the spot I started in. One thing that had been really helpful was that my boyfriend had quit vaping a few days before I decided to quit smoking, and it was nice that we were supporting each other. But that meant that once I started smoking more, he went back to vaping. I feel guilty that I was the reason neither of us were able to stick to quitting.

One achievement, however, is that we had a beach day on Wednesday and the whole area is no smoking. We were there for about 5 hours and I actually didn’t have any cravings! I had brought my lozenges just in case but really didn’t feel like I needed those either.

So I guess the silver lining is that my mindset has changed in that I don’t feel like I NEED to smoke as much anymore. It’s nice to enjoy a cigarette but I no longer feel anxiety about getting my next smoke break. You guys really helped me get into that mindset, so thank you.

As of right now, I guess it’d be nice to hear y’all’s stories and how much your lives have changed since quitting. I think some success stories would be good to read so I can have something positive to work towards. Now’s your chance to toot your own horn!

Sorry this was so long and rambly, it’s 5:30 AM and I’m still kind of out of it haha. Any and all support would be really helpful. :)

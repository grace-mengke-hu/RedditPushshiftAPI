I am doing so well, but I have some questions.

I am writing a paper right now and I am dying for a cigarette, however I know that I don't really want one and I am not even craving the nicotine, I want something that I achieve from smoking, but I might be able to find those things elsewhere. Here are my current reasons: 

I seek some relief from stress.
I want a change of mental state that is significant but not long lasting.
I want to take a break from work.
I want to put myself in a slightly altered mindset that will jumpstart my thinking.

What are some things that can satisfy some of these wants that isn't smoking?

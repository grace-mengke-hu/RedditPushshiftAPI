Allen Carr's book(s)...

I searched for Allen Carr's "Easy Ways to Stop Smoking" via amazon.com and several books appeared, a standard book title and then one which is tailored to women smokers. Which book are you guys referring to when you mention "Allen Carr's book?" I already downloaded the .pdf file but want to purchase a hard copy of the book.

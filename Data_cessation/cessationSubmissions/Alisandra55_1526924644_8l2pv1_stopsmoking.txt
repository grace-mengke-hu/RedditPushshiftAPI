So my “mission” (should I choose to accept it😀)

On “Quit” app is to post what helped. (1) Chantix. Smoked 38 years. This medication decreased physical urges so I had more the mental battle to fight, which was hard enough (2) Mike &amp; Ike sours For some reason that really sour taste distracted me during cravings. (3) thinking of myself as a non-smoker. (4) support from family, friends, this site, &amp; the apps: there is also American Cancer society hotline &amp; quit groups. (5) God  (did a lot of praying &amp; I believe God gave me strength in the hard times, including a surgery &amp; painful recovery period)   Hope this might help others. Hang in there: it is soooooo worth it!!!

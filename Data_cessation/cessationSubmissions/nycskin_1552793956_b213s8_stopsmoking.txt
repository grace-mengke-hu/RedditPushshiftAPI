Please quit

It has been 6 months 2 days and 16 hours since me and my wife's last cigarette. We both quit when we found out her mother had lung cancer. The doctors removed the cancer and part of her rib and we thought she beat it. We found out today the cancer is back, it is in the lung, bones and the liver. They just gave her 2 weeks to live and put her on hospice. She is 66 years old. It is just not worth it.

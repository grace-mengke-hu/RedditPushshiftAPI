Please help

I stopped for 6 months then picked up again. I stopped again in January and managed 3 months but I've picked it up AGAIN! I have my first child on the way and don't want to be a smoking parent! Any advice? I only smoke 5/6 a day but always manage to convince myself that it's okay because it's such a small number. My wife is due 15th May and I am desperate not to be a smoker when my daughter arrives. What helped everyone here?

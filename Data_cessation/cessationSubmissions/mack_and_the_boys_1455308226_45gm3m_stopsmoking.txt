Fronting up - I fucked up.

Ummed and ahhed about posting this but feel I have to. This is the place for total honesty. I'm on 86 days now and was WAY over the worst. Tuesday was my birthday, and I'm staying at my recently deceased Grandmother's house. I was boozing and toasting myself as you do and there was a pack of B & H lying about...hilariously, this was an unopened pack from the mid 90's when my Grandad was still alive ! I imagine there was a mind boggling amount of carcinogens involved in the two cigs that I smoked...I 'treated' myself because it was my birthday. I'd had no thoughts about doing this for the 2 and a half months since I quit...you really do have to stay vigilant at all times. Especially when it's your birthday and you're in the mood for stroking your ego and believing your own hype !

Immediately after smoking the two I felt rotten. I texted a couple of mates that evening to unload. I felt even worse the next day. I have really beaten myself up in the 3 days since. In a way I'm pleased with my reaction. My resolve is as strong as it was but the physical cravings have come back a vengeance. Very pissed off with myself but prepared to take the punishment until it clears. Which it will.

Not even one people !

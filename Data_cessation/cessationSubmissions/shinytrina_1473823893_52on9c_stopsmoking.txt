I might just make it after all

A bit about my smoking history. I started at 12 and am now 39 with a 2ppd habit, until this morning.

I have tried quitting several times in the past (needless to say unsuccessfully), but things have changed and now I need to stay quit, not only for myself, but I have a surgery coming up and they want you nicotine free for 6 weeks before the surgery. I have about 3 months to get there.

The surgery is something that I have been looking forward to and the last thing I want to do is risk my chance of messing it up and giving the surgeon a reason not to operate.

I went today to the vape shop and bought an e-cigarette and juice. I know that it is not being totally free of nicotine, but I figure it is better than to keep on sucking a bunch of toxins (somewhere around 4000 per cigarette and when you figure 2 packs of 25 cigarettes per day that is 200,000 per day which is pretty scary when you think about that).

I also am tired of trying to use perfumes and gum to try to cover up the smell of cigarette smoke and being out of breath when climbing up a flight of stairs at work (which left me in a breathless coughing fit the other day).

My Dad's observations since he quit a couple decades ago.

Both my parents were smokers when they were younger, before they had any kids. I decided to quit myself a couple of days ago and asked them for some nuggets of wisdom. 

My dad used to be a pack a day kind of guy. He managed to quit around 1990 with my mom. He went to a high school reunion in 2010 and out of a group of 15 friends, only him and one other person had managed to quit. A couple of them have died from health issues since then. My dad was also the only one who had both parents alive, who also happened to be ex-smokers, and now they've both made it to their 90s. 

Do it for your health!

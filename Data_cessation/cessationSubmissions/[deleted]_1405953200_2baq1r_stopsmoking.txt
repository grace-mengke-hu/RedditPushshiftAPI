Made it 3 1/2 weeks and crumbled

I was doing so well for the last 3 1/2 weeks. Did not smoke one cigarette even in situations where i would chain smoke (camping, partying, golfing). Well on Friday night I went out downtown and made it the entire night until the way home where I was talking with a friend (smoker) that I hadn't seen in a year, when I smoked 2 cigarettes. At the time I didn't feel too terrible about it mostly because I was wasted, however the next morning was a whole different story. It's now Monday and I still feel just as bad about it...

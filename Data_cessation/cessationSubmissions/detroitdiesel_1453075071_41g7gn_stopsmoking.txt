16 days/18 years

I started smoking when I was 14 but want practiced till I was 16. I've tried quitting so many times I lost count but now instead of beating myself up for FAILURE, I've accepted that it's a part of the process. FORGIVE YOURSELF. I've been actually quitting since July and I'll never stop quitting forever. I feel better than I have in years and I'm not giving that back for anything.

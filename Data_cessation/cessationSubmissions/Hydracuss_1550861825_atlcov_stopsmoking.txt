Cigarettes suddenly taste horrible to me, why?

Certainly not complaining here. I've never been addicted to smoking, I often smoked when I went out or if I was around friends who smoked a lot. For about 3 years I smoked on and off and I have no problem not smoking. Recently I spent a few weeks abroad with friends and they all smoked so naturally I smoked too. But after 1 week, cigarettes started to taste weird to me. I didn't really like it but kept doing it anyway because it still kinda helped me chill when I was stressed. Ever since I haven't smoked for about 2 weeks. One of my sisters offered me a cig after I picked her up from the airport. So we sat down and smoked and it's a brand I've always smoked. But for whatever reason I really hated it. The smoke, the taste, the smell,... Half way I wanted to throw it away but didn't because sis would complain about wasting her cigs.

So I'm just wondering, has anyone else suddenly developed an aversion for cigarettes out of the blue? I didn't smoke much to begin with, but for years I still enjoyed it at least. It's just strange.

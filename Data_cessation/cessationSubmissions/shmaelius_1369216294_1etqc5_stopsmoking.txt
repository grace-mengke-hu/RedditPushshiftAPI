Why did you stop smoking?

I'm doing a class project regarding persuasion, and I have a question for the fine people of reddit.  Perhaps through answering this question, you can help others quit as well.

I know we all have good motivations to stop smoking- family, health and lifestyle.  We all know that smoking is bad for you.  Smokers know that smoking is bad for them.  That still doesn't actually persuade them to stop.  The question I have for you all is:

What finally persuaded you to stop smoking?  A book?  A family member?  What were the circumstances and how has it worked for you?

I appreciate you all taking time out to help me with this project.

HELP!! I can't stop eating!

I have been smoke free for a month now, yay! The trouble is I literally cannot stop eating!! I don't want to smoke, and I'm so chuffed that I have managed to stop. But I don't want to keep gaining weight. Has anyone got any suggestions? I work from home which is hard as there is always good available, but I just can't help myself!! HHHEEELLLPPP!!!!!

I've started smoking again sometimes after quitting for 2.5 years

I had completely quit smoking around feb 2014 thanks to vaping and stayed that way for 2.5 years

But recently I've been smoking cigarettes (usually rollies or rarer cigarettes) some weekends or when drinking and this has been going on for a few months now.

Could someone chime in on how harmful this is? I feel fine other than the day after I smoke when I tend to sometimes cough more. 

I'd already quit vaping around a year ago but I've still got my vaporisers so if smoking around 3-4 cigarettes once every 2 weeks ish is harmful I'll start right back up with vaping again.



TL;DR
Is moderate smoking harmful?

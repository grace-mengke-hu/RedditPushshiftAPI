22 days strong

It hasn't been easy,  but I've made it 22 days without a cigarette.  To be honest,  I don't even think about smoking during most of the day now. In the beginning I noticed it was really helpful to just let stuff go.  That's what helped me.  It sounds strange,  but I've had to be a lot more forgiving to stay quit.  Getting upset about some asshole in traffic was a sure way to get me to light up. If you're in the early days of quitting,  take a deep breath and let some of the petty stuff go. It's not worth going back to smoking over.

28 days! I can barely believe it!

Hey everyone! Just checking in!

Currently I am so happy with myself that I have managed to stay quit for as long as I have. I quit once before, about three years ago when I was 24, and quit for a year. I started up again about a year ago and have been trying to quit ever since. Usually I would make it a week, maybe almost two before I cracked. I was getting so frustrated with myself! How did I quit for an entire year, and now I can't even go a full three days.

But I did it! I am almost to a month and I barely think about smoking anymore. When I was a smoker (both times) my first thought when waking up was having a smoke. My first thought when getting into the car was having a smoke. My first thought when getting out of work! After eating at a restaurant. When out drinking with friends! The first thing was ALWAYS cigarettes!

I will never let myself become a smoker again. After going through trying to quit again, I didn't realize how hard it would be, I figured I quit for a year, I can quit again. But I was so wrong. It was so much harder to quit this time than it was even four years ago. But I finally did it again, and YOU can do it too!

The sooner you do it, the easier it's going to be. It only gets harder! I feel so much better now. Not as tired, I have more energy through the day, I want to get outside and breath and do things! I have started yoga again, AND best of all - I don't have to stop at the store every day for a pack. 

Thanks for listening everyone!

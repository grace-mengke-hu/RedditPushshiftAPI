Not completely sure why I do it.

I'm probably not as a big smoker as most of the people here trying to stop, but I do smoke quite a lot when I go out with friends to a bar or anywhere else really. In a night I can smoke half a pack to 3 quarter of it, but when I don't go out I a pack can last me a week or even a week and a Half. Today I've smoked one cigarette, yesterday I've smoked one too. I like to think that I'm not addicted but for some reason I can't get around not smoking one when I'm alone at my house or on break at my job.

I don't feel compelled to stop as I see myself as not that much into smoking but something inside of me is telling to fuck off. 

Health wise I'm really not that bad, I'm more healthy than most of my friends who never smoke cigarette, but that's really due to how I eat (Healthy) and to the fact that I still do quite a bit of exercise.

Any one as had experience with that type problem?

Gradually reduce or go cold turkey?

I gave up smoking months ago but I fucked up this week, I bought a packet about 4 days ago and I've been smoking since. I got through about 30. I've got 2 left now and I'm stopping after this. 

My question is for anyone with experience of withdrawls. Will it be better to just smoke them today and be done with it, or will saving one for tomorrow night and one for the day after help reduce the withdrawls? (I'm not throwing them away)

Thanks in advance.

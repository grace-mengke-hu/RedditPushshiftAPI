I can't breathe

I've been smoking for 18 years. I'm 34, I've quit here and there for short periods of time but it never sticks. I smoke 1 1/2 to 2 packs a day and have had bronchitis about 6 times in the past 5 years. I wake up and hack and the first thing I do is light up. I want to stop but I get horrible anxiety and rage, last time I quit after a few weeks I picked up a trashcan at work and through it across the room. I'm sick of this, any tips?

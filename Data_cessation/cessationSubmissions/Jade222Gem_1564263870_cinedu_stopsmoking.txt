It's 2 years today since I quit. Thought I'd drop in to say if I can do it then you can, too. Just take it one day at a time and crush that nicotine monster underfoot anytime he tries to put his stinky little head above the parapet.

Quitting is so worth it.  You'll feel like a new person health-wise.   Good luck to everyone  Onward and upwards!

What helped me most.

The why quit forum.  whyquit.com

Allen Carr's book.

They both armed me with the knowledge I needed not to fall into the relapse traps.   

Both are well worth looking at.  All the best.

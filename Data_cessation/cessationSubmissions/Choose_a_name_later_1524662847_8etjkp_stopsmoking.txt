High Score! 

At least for me. 

Passing on cigars at weddings, staying indoors at the bar during the smoke break, foregoing the holy trinity of a smoke, a coffee, and that early morning BM. These are all things I never thought I would be able to do. 

I owe the beginning of my journey to all of you and your support. I couldn't have done it without you. 

I have, however, left this sub about 2 years ago. While I should strive to support everyone like I felt supported, I realized how much of my motivation was simply from the actual and truthful decision of mine to stop. Those of you who have made this decision for yourselves know exactly what I am typing about. 

I wish this epiphany on all of you and hope you no longer need this sub. I also wish you the safe journey that brings your milestone stories back here to add to this positivity pile. 

Love you guys!

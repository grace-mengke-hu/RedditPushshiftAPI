I don't want to stop smoking, but I really should stop smoking. Any tips? See text for specs.

I just discovered this subreddit today so if there are previous posts I should look at, I'd be grateful for links.

I've been smoking on and off for most of my life.  I grew up around cigarettes - my father has smoked my entire life - and most of my friends have quit, but I seem to keep starting back up after I quit for, say, a month.  

My wife hates it, so I smoke when I'm not around her (but I tell her I smoked if she asks).  

My biggest trigger is that I drive for a living, and I love to smoke when I drive especially if I'm getting tired and it's late in the day (don't want caffeine or I won't sleep well).  But even when I'm not tired, I like smoking while I drive.  It's pretty fun.  

I've tried chewing gum, sucking suckers, nicotine gum...I'm still smoking.

I don't want to quit, but I know I should.  Lately, I've started visualizing my lungs when I inhale cigarette smoke, and it grosses me out, but not enough to stop smoking.  

Can anyone help?

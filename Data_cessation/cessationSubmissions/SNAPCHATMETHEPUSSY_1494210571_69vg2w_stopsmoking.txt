Day Three Cold Turkey

Cravings have been absolutely terrible the past few days. They have seemed to let up now though. I still have psychological cravings but those aren't as bad as the awful physical ones. I'm still very proud of myself. I've told my smoker friends that I'm quitting and to keep all the cigarettes away from me. Cravings are just weaknesses leaving the body. Man of Steel. What would superman do? Superman would not smoke. We got this.

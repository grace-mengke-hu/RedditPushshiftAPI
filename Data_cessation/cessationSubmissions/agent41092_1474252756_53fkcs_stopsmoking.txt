Thoughts on timing of quitting

I'm halfway through my second to last cigarette of my pack, been wanting to quit for a while, hate the fact that I'm a smoker. Worried about the withdrawals. I don't want to be on edge, I kinda feel that I've convinced myself that my temper will be short with the withdrawals and I'm generally a pretty easy going person. The timing issue is that I'm planning on smoking my last cigarette on the 30 min walk to our car before a tightly cramped 4 hour drive with 4 other people. They can be a bit much to handle but I imagine they'll fall asleep at some point. I have Monday off of work but I go back on Tuesday and work is where a lot of my daily stress comes from. I don't want to be short tempered there dead center in my withdrawals. I can take Tuesday off as well but I'm not sure if my patience will still be running thin around then. 

I guess I'm asking if I'm way over analyzing how short tempered I could potentially be for the first 48 hours or so. I plan on getting a bag of apples to help curb the habitual hand to mouth addiction.

Maybe I should try at a time when I can more control my environment with 3-4 days off work/less stress?

Any thoughts are appreciated, TIA

8 year pack a day smoker. Read Allen Carr's book in one sitting last night, and had my final cigarette

Been getting some cravings after waking up this morning, its very odd not having a smoke after waking up. But I know it's just the little monster dying. 

I'm so excited to get my health money and self respect back. Just wanted to introduce myself. I'd fully recommend that book for anyone who really wants to quit.

The one issue is that my girlfriend still smokes, she wants to quit too, but seemed very unconvinced about the book. So she's still going out to the porch to smoke which is tricky for me. But I dont want them, and I don't need them. I'm rambling. Cheers guys!

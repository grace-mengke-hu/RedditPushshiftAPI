Alone in Europe

I'm here for a week. There's a gas station across the street and my room has a balcony. I really want to go get a pack and a bottle and enjoy the solitude - no kids, no husband, no house to clean, laundry to fold. Nothing but time. I really might not make it.

But I want this trip to be my trip back into feeling my feels and being mindful. Becoming a better person. A better parent and spouse, not one that hides in the garage when things get ugly. One that isn't racked with guilt and terrified she's going to orphan her children. 

I'm all alone.

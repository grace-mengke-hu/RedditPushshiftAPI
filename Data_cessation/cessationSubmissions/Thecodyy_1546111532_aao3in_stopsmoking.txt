My personal progress and what I’m doing to save money, and quit for good.

Hi all! So I’m officially 2 days without a cig. I am however using a juul. I couldn’t have quit without it. There was just no way for me.

I’m already breathing better, and I can feel that I have more energy.

I spend roughly $20 a day on cigs, and a pack of 4 juul pods at $25 will last me about a week.

So I’m using the Acorns app on my phone to take out $20 a day from my account and deposit it into its “savings”

Not sure what I’m going to spend the extra $7,000 on in a year but I’m excited for it!

I do plan on weening myself slowly from the juul.

Yesterday I was super moody. Today is definitely better and I do crave a cig here and there but I just hit the juul a couple times and it goes away.

Just thought I’d share, this method may not be for everyone but so far it’s working for me. Good luck everyone!

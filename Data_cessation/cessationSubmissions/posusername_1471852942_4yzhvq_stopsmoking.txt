Defeat, shame and frustration. I have no willpower, I have no self control, I have no discipline. It would've been 94 days today if I hadn't quit from quitting. Three days is the longest I've gone without a cigarette and that's only because I couldn't afford them until payday! Chantix was like a light in a smokey tunnel until I had a dream of finding a family member face down and dead... Smoke or willingly put yourself through something that'll make your depression worse? I need help but I don't even know how to get out of my own way. I'm just down, guys. Sorry and thanks for letting me rant. I'm gonna go smoke a cigarette now :/

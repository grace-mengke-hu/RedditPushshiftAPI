went to a wedding

I went to the wedding of one of my oldest friends on Saturday. Once or twice I wanted a smoke but mostly I was thinking about everything I might have missed if I was out smoking! I might have missed their first dance or them cutting the cake. I felt lucky for the first time that I didn't need to step out for a cigarette. And because it was -7 degrees out!!

Is Champix making me irritable, hostile, angry, depressed?

I decided to start on Champix and it's worked wonders in the sense that I no longer get any pleasure from smoking and I have no desire to continue with it, but I've felt completely horrible the entire time I've been on it. I should mention that I have bipolar disorder so I'm predisposed to moods like this, but it seems like things only got really bad for me when I started on the Champix. At least before there was some joy to go along with the hard times, now I'm just angry all the time, hostile to everybody, and suicide is the only thing I can think about for any length of time. Overnight, I have given up on all of my dreams and I no longer get any pleasure from the things that used to make me feel happy. I know there was a study in 2009 showing no link between Champix and mental health problems, but the anecdotal evidence points in the exact opposite direction. Could it be the Champix? Should I stop taking it?

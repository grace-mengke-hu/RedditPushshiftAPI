100 day mini-rant/soapbox!

A few tidbits about my first 100 days (about a pack/day for 8 years):

• Over 1500 cigarettes NOT smoked
• Over $600 saved
• Over 25 lbs. lost
• Smell and taste came back in a way I didn't know existed
• Records for longest distance jogged (3mi) and biked (36mi) came easily
• Significantly reduced alcohol intake
• Realized that getting into better shape and being healthier is NOT that hard at all
• New found sense of self confidence AND self worth
• Tackling new challenges and goals both professionally and personally not only seem less daunting, but much more exciting
•  No more chest pains, no more coughing and wheezing and trying to play it off like it's a cold, my skin looks much better, no more worrying about breathing on people or smelly clothes, no more leaving social events and dinners to stand outside by myself to get my fix, no more getting anxious while I'm working and fixating til I get out and have a smoke, no more skipping nutritious breakfasts and snacks and holding myself over with cigarettes.  This list goes on and on and on... 

For those of you struggling in the beginning, I agree that it can seem difficult at times.  Make sure to take time every day to smile about the decision you've made, and look for positives that you didn't have before.  Soon you'll be thinking about those far more often than cravings.  I'm still new to being a nonsmoker and there are still times that seem difficult, but doing something truly great for yourself makes cravings seem very petty, and they only last a couple minutes anyways.  Keep up the good work everyone!

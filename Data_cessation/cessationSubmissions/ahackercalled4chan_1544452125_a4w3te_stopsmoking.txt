Relapse after 2 days

i just discovered this sub this morning. i tried to stop smoking on Friday because my wife an both ran out at the same time. we trashed our ash-trays &amp; cleaned up everything. Confiscated all the lighters &amp; hid them away.  Saturday &amp; Sunday were unbearable at times, but thankfully i was able to find an old vape pen that still had some charge in it.

but both my wife &amp; i broke down this morning &amp; we bought a pack.
i feel disgusting and guilty.

my brain keeps freaking out and giving me anxiety attacks from the nicotine withdrawal. i don't know how i can break this addiction.

i guess i just needed to confess my struggles to y'all since i know y'all can relate. could really use some encouragement &amp; advice on strategies to quit successfully.

thanks for reading &amp; listening to my victim-puke

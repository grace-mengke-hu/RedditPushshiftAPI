100 hours smoke free

After 2 years of 'quitting' practically every week I never thought I'd see the day where I had clocked 100 hours smoke free.  It got to the point where I'd lie to my family and my partner about smoking, I suppose I was ashamed of the addiction.? After every pack I said to myself that's it. Last one. You can do this, and within 8 hours I would be making the same promise to myself after buying a new pack. Now, finally I heard about a tablet that helped you quit but with several nasty side effects. At this point I didn't care. I've been on champix for two weeks now and although I think about smoking a lot it is definitely being pushed to the back of my mind, further and further each day.  I was one of those smokers who had tried everything. E-cig, vaporisers, books, cds, and pretty much every form of nrt... Sometimes I feel shame that I had to resort to meds but that soon goes when I look at my smoke free app telling me how much my breathing has improved etc.  if anyone is struggling and had tried the conventional methods I'd recommend champix (or the other alternative which name escapes me) just be prepared, it is s different kind of challenge than going cold turkey and still requires determination.

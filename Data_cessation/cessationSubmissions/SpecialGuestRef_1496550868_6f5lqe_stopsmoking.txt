Day 3, first time to a bar since quitting.

Our band played tonight at a very smoky bar and I didn't have a drink or a smoke or an urge truly. After our set I went and sat by the car with the equipment until time to leave so I could stay away from any temptations. Afterwards at home we unloaded and the cravings set in. My bandmates were smoking but I never caved, I just chewed a toothpick and ate a jolly rancher and played on my phone. Cigarettes have that gross smell now so them smoking actually made me want it less. Thanks again to this sub and good luck to all.

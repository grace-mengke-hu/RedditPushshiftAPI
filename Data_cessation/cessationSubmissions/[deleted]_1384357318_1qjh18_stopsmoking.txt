Terrible taste

So in the last couple of days, since quitting 9 days ago, I've started to develop a terrible taste in mouth coming from the back of my throat. I should also mention that I have started to experience what seems like something being constantly stuck in my throat, phlegm perhaps? Is this normal? It's absolutely horrible and no matter what I do I can't seem to get rid of it.

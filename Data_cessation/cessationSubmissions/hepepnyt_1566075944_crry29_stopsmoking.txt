How to counter depression, sadness, anger without smoking?

Hi, I get all those negative withdrawal feelings from quitting smoking like depression, sadness, anger, loosing motivation and energy and don't know how to cope with them.

I do sports a lot but it helps only at moment. Socializing is hard as I think about smoking half of time. This is even harded because I know, cigarets still exist and it is so easy to reach for them. But I don't want to.

I just need something which could kick me out of blue, makes me happy though day. Those little joys like driving, running, food, sweets, good talk, etc are fine but in compare with what I lost after quitting, it is so weak.

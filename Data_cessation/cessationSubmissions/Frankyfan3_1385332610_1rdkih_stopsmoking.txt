Oh, hey. 81 days

Thanks for the blingin' flare to remind me how far I've come.

It's not an even number, or even very significant except for the fact that I'm having the first lazy Sunday in a long time & have no inclination to smoke. Lazy Sundays were super triggering back in the day.

Went out last night with some folks who were smoking & not even a little bit tempted. Yeah!

Quit thanks to meditation

I started smoking Marlboro Lights several months after turning 18 at the end of 2009, eventually making it to Reds back in 2011 and smoking a pack a day. I tried the lozenges a few times, but it only helped my addiction grow more. I grew into the electronic cigarette, which I consider a lot easier to quit with by a landslide.

A friend came up with the suggestion of meditation for stress, to generally just help me relax. He told me since I knew about the city's digital library, I should try checking out some books on it. So I picked the first book that showed up, called "The Heart of Buddhist Meditation" by Nyanaponika Thera. It helped me amazingly to relax. At work, my e cigarette battery broke, so I just said I was done with it and threw the whole things away, after a little over five years of smoking.

I also checked out a meditation center here in my city, which was free and helped. I understand a lot of these preach Buddhism, but I was really open to this. That's my choice, and I don't push it on anyone.

Ofcourse meditation helped me, but some other things that helped were to not worry about being stupid on days 2 and 3, let myself screw up basically and make as many mistakes as I must. Letting my body's blood pressure go low and high, understanding I will be ok. Most of all, it was meditation. I meditated for three hours on day 2 and 3, which helped by far the most.

I'm mostly glad of all the time and money I've saved. Looking for a hobby after quitting, will help because you will see extra time get very boring. And the extra money I had for things was the best part. I wasn't spending nearly as much thanks to e cigarettes, but even the little bit is felt afterwords. I would also suggest tapering down on your e cig dosage before quitting, that seemed to help. I went from 32 mg per ml to 18 mg before quitting. I was originally going to go the whole way to 0 mg, but was pretty confident I could do it.

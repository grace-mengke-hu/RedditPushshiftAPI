Still @ 0

Not even sure exactly how long.. 2 months or so?  And cold turkey for the first time. (I’ve tried to quit countless times over the past couple years)
This was the easiest quit ever.  

Thing that really clicked for me was getting to the root of what it was about for me..
I’m sure that’s been different throughout the years.. 
But at this point I figured out what that was...

And I realized there were so many other ways to satisfy the feeling/need I felt cigarettes filled.
That they really don’t provide any benefit, except to be able to say “fuck it, this is for me”;  which is a powerful feeling.

But there are infinite more ways to get that feeling that are way better and even helpful for me.

I just put out my last cigarette!

I feel very excited and slightly nervous, not nervous about quitting, just nervous about what my life is going to be like. 

I’m 35 and have been smoking since I was 14, so basically my whole adult life and almost my whole adolescence.

I don’t know what a life without cigarettes is, I really have no idea. But I’m excited to find out. Easily the last 10-15 years I haven’t even enjoyed the smoking and I’ve hated myself for doing that to myself, but what’s done is done.

Now on to a better life.

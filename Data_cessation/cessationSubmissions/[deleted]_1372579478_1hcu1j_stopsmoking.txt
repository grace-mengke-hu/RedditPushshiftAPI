Damn the longest I've been able to stay away

I started smoking when I was 17 and I absolutely hated. It made me feel nauseous and I even threw up once from smoking. I later picked it up while I was in China because I just smoked so I could relax from the stress of social interactions. Then smoking cigarettes become a clutch for everything, any emotion I felt. Happy, sad, angry it always resulted in a cigarette. Recently I was able to break that routine, I'm 24 now, I originally started with e-cigs. I was on that for 3 weeks and then I was off completey for another 3 weeks and now I'm occasionally hitting the e cig whenever I get a chance. 

I don't know what I'm exactly trying to get across. I feel bummed out and wish I could just smoke one right now but I know it never helps but it does feel good to vent out on here. 

Cheers to feeling better

I was nicotine free for a day and a half, and I just lit a cigarette... I feel awful

Okay I quit a day and a half ago. And I thought I could take it. Actually, not being able to light a cigarette while drinking coffee/after eating/when waiting wasn't that hard for me. I 'missed' it, but it wasn't hard to take it.. 

My biggest problems were CONSTANT cravings... I've read that a craving lasts only 5-7 minutes, but mine were constant :( I think they DIDN'T last 5-7 minutes... and when I say craving, I don't mean "a wish to light a cigarette" only, but unbearable dizziness/feeling like I am out of reality/inability to process thoughts/sloppy walking/etc. So if it was only craving, I could proceed... but it's a set of physical symptoms too which is the worst. I felt like I was high on some hard drugs.

I lit up a cigarette an hour ago and was close to fainting while smoking it!!! But after that I felt fine, I don't have any cravings now... is it too late to 'continue' not smoking? I feel disappointed in myself. I shouldn't have lit that cigarette.

I have been smoking for the last 6-7 years, since I was 15. I definitely need to quit.

I read "Easy Way to quit smoking" last year.. It lasted two days for me until I started smoking again..

28 days smoke free

Yeah, it has been almost a month that i dont inhale that disgusting smoke. I feel phisycally better, I walk down the road much better, the food tastes incredible now and I've saved some Money too.
Although, it hasn't been easy, the first week was the hardest, because I had cravings all the time , but now I have less. Psychologically, I get negative thoughts a lot of times , I get irritated easily and even sometimes I Just want to smoke a cigarette, Just not to be so Gross to the people that surrounds me (Family, girlfriend, friends). 
It has been tough, but i will not give up.

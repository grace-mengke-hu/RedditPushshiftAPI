7 Days Tobacco free and now vaping my weed

I've quit tobacco now for a week and I'm missing my joints. I've made the transition to vaping which is getting me through these tough times. I'm 41 and have smoked cigarettes since the age of 13. I've smoked joints daily for over 20 years and trying to change a habit of a lifetime is hard. All my friends are still blazing SPLIFFS and it smells so damn good. I know for health reasons I need to stay well clear of tobacco as I'm a pure addict. I won't quit weed as I love it so much and find it helps me focus and stay relaxed. Just hoping I don't get bored of vaping. I have to admit that it's a cleaner way of getting high and it sure works!! Anyone else made the switch to vaping and stuck to it. Any advice welcome!! Thanks

My app led me here.....

5195 minutes since my last cigarette (3 &amp; 1/2 days).
Todayâ€™s mission on my app was to visit this site and chat about how I feel. So letâ€™s have a go..

I feel like a ski slope. I go down and then up then down and then up. I feel like nothing will help except a cigarette but then I feel immense pride that Iâ€™m actually doing it.

Ps..... Life smells good, food tastes good and donâ€™t drink too much coffee ðŸ™ˆ

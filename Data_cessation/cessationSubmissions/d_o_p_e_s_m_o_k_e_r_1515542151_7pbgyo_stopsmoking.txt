This little trick helped push me over the edge and quit for good. It's gross, but it worked for me.

So after 8 years of smoking, and about 3 more of "trying to quit" I was really pissed at myself, and came up with a Clockwork Orange style solution to my problem: make myself sick when I think of cigarettes.

I did this experiment more than 2 years ago and still get nauseous when I think about smoking.

Here's what I did: when I decided the pack I was on would be my last, I collected the ash and butts from my ashtrays, put them in a half-full jar of water and closed the lid.

When that pack was gone, whenever I got the urge to smoke, I would pop the lid off the butt jar and took a big whiff of that delicious brew. The smell is absolutely vile, I would almost vomit, but I made myself take a bigger sniff. Then I reminded myself that I was putting that filth into my lungs, every day. Craving over, rewiring started.

Once you make yourself fully realize how disgusting that shit really is, and it's very hard to look at cigarettes the same way again. 

You got this âœŒ

day 3 smoke-free

hahaha. wordplay :). I'm back again!

So this is my third day. I have managed not to smoke at all (yay meee!), but I did something I want to share with you. 
I put aside a jar in my apartment. I wrote on it cigarettes, then crossed that and wrote on it tattoos. I then divided the amount a pack of smokes costs to the number of cigarettes inside. Everytime I feel a craving, I put that amount in the jar. It helps me a ton. Also, man, I spent a shitload of money on cigarettes. Shame on me. I could have had a new car by now.

Mental issues

How did you guys get over the mental hump of not smoking? I have quit in the past but no matter what I did I could never get smoking out of my head. The longest I quit was 4 months and nothing changed since day one. I want to quit for good and not let my mind want it when my body doesn't. 

I should add that I'm a stay at home mama and smoking is like my "break" from the monotony of laundry and baby stuff ;).

Thanks!

Cigarette free for 25 days, nicotine free for 10.

And I feel amazing. The cravings and triggers have gotten much easier to resist, and I can breathe and taste and stuff. I haven't gotten headaches yet, and I'm coughing LESS than I was as a smoker. Haven't started getting rid of the leftovers yet, so I'm not looking forwards to that, but I still have no intention of ever picking up a smoke again.

I was having pretty good success with the patch, but I went out of town last weekend, and wore a patch on my flight. The next day I just didn't put one on. I had gone a few single days patchless before but the next day I had to wear one to beat the cravings. This time I just kind of... Didn't. I was hanging out with smoker friends, I went to a concert. I drank. Every craving I got I was able to simply talk down. And then I kept going. 

I'm so happy right now.

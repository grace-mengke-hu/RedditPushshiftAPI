How many times have you quit/relapsed? What do you enjoy about quitting?

I'm on day five of what's probably my third or fourth time in my life quitting. The longest I ever made it was 4 years of no smoking before I relapsed due to depression and personal issues. I've kind of been off and on with it since then, but I'm determined to be done with it now. It's made difficult by things that people say like, "Once a smoker, always a smoker." and the idea that I'll just pick it up again someday when I can afford it and want to enjoy the feeling. I don't know, but I don't have any plans to start again anytime soon.

One thing I enjoy is how the congestion/mucus in your chest and throat starts to break up after a few days of quitting. It's a nice, satisfying feeling and one I'll miss considering you can only really quit once! (unless you start again)

Anyways, sorry for the rather pointless post, I just figured I'd write this down for my own reference and use the flair on this board to track my progress.

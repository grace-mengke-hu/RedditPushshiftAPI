Thoughts from the other side.

Well there are two things I've almost forgotten now that I'm this far into the journey:

1. The fact that I ever smoked at all 
2. How much this sub helped me with my first few weeks

So I'm making this post to just reflect upon this sub and what it's done for me in the hope that you might find it in some way useful. I smoked from the ages of 15 to 20, I was one of the first victims of a new generation and now that I look back, those numbers scare me; I was so young and at such a critical period of life. I'm glad I quit though, and you can too, to anyone who's just begun, keep at it and relish the grind.

It sounds strange, but just try and find the satisfaction in the craving: physical evidence that you will get results and achieve something big. I know I'm not as far into this as some on this sub, but I feel like there's no harm in just throwing my two cents out there in the hope that someone will get some comfort as they bite into cushions and chew off the ends of pencils. Just keep going, your future self will thank you.

Here I go again!

So in December, I was contemplating quitting, until i realized there were too many temptations in that month (vegas, raves, etc.) that I personally could not resist smoking in that month. I was about 6 days in quitting before my friends and I went to vegas.... and it was all downhill from there of course...

Decided that I would just make it a new years resolution like everyone else, but kind of a half-assed promise to myself. then last night, my friend's younger brother developed pneumonia and aplastic anemia. he is currently in ICU and will require a bone marrow transplant. the hospital had to make him unconscious because it was too painful to breathe from the lung infection. i've known my friend and his family since i was in elementary school. it really shocked me and i thought in a way it was a sign that I personally need to take care of my body better and really count my blessings. so as i pray for his recovery, I decided I will quit not only for the many benefits of my own health, but also to quit for the sake of supporting his recovery. 

over 23 hours in, feeling like shit, but hey, i remember feeling a lot more awesome when i quit for only 6 days. i can only imagine how it feels  when i quit for a lifetime. so good luck to you all and lets all feel shitty together in the beginning stages and kick this stupid habit that we stupidly developed!

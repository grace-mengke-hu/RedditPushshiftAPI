Hey, this sub amongst other things made me decide you just up and quit yesterday :D

i just wanted to say thanks, i've been smoking for about 5 years now, i did quit once about 2 years ago for a period of about a year, then i started smoking a cig here, a cig there, when asking people for a smoke got to the point where its just not cool, i started buying packs again, which just made me smoke more... and more.. and more...

so i've been contemplating quitting for a while now as the price for a pack in my country is ridiculous (about 9.21$ for a pack of marlboro!!)  and a broke student i shouldn't be throwing money away on this crap...
i saw this sub the other day and read some stories, then yesterday i met friend i haven't seen for a couple of months, we sat down for a smoke and he told me he quit, and then a couple of hours later as i was sitting down to do an assignment i noticed my hand smells like ash... that was the last straw and i just didn't feel the need to smoke since.

so thanks, about 24 since my last one and i dont see my self going back, now i just need to find a way to make my wife quit as well :P

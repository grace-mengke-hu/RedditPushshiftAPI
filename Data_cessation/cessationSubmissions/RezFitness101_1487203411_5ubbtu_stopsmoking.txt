Hello I quit smoking for 20 days now but...

I started smoking 3 months ago just causally nothing to bad 3-5 a day was just wondering if this little smoking spree is going to affect me in the long run. Quitting was really easy i didn't have cravings what so ever. I think it's because I only smoked socially. my lungs feel fine, if it makes a difference I just smoked regular cigarettes thanks for any responses.

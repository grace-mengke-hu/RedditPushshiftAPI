I wanna be a non-smoker

Hello everyone, I've got a date set for April 1st. I've tried to stop smoking so many times I've lost track. I truly want this one to be my final try and become a non-smoker! Last year I stopped twice. Once for 26 days and the other was a little over 3 months. I get stressed out and on impulse go buy a pack. I've tried prescriptions, patches, nicotine gum, chewing on straws, toothpicks, gum, hard candy and just about everything else. I would appreciate any input, suggestions and support.

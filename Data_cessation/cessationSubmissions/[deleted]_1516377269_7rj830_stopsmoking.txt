Its been over 2 weeks

Its been 17 days, the first 4 days I was using Nicorette lozenges and it was a tough go, after the first 4 I decided to try and kick it. So here I am 2 weeks without any nicotine and I feel like Im having a harder time now then I did my first week. I just want an idea of some sort of timeline of what im going through. the internet sites are saying after 3 days im over the hard part, put I don't find that's the case. Im more agitated now, I feel like depression is setting in and I feel my anxiety is growing. Im not surrounded by any smokers or former smokers so I cant ask them. can anyone let me know what to expect emotionally and mentally.

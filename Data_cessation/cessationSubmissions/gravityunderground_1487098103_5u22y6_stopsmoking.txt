Day 50! Sharing an update and hope to motivate fellow quitters...Cravings are 95% gone and I'm exercising 4x a week.

I'm moving beyond nicotine addiction and started studying healthy eating (documentaries on YouTube).  I feel and look noticeably better. Younger, lighter, happier.  I sleep better and worry less.  Wife is happy (relieved) and I'm able to play with the kids more actively. Everything is better without nicotine. The smell of an ash tray now elicit very powerful emotions (disgust, resentment, hate of Philip Morris execs, etc). 

If you're on this subreddit, it's gotta mean you wanna quit smoking. It's totally possible and absolutely worth it.

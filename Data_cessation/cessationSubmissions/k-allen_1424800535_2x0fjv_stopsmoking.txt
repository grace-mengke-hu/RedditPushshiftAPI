Allergic reaction made me realize so much

I am coming off of a very stressful weekend (that should be an oxymoron). It all started with an infection that prompted a prescription for a simple antibiotic. Two days later I get a case of the worst itchy skin all over, I attributed this to the cold dry weather and went to put some lotion on. This is when I discovered huge red hives and blotches all over my body. For what ever reason this did not convince me I was having an allergic reaction and I decided it would just go away. Needless to say it did not, and a visit to the hospital confirmed I was indeed allergic to the medicine my doctor prescribed to me. This realization absolutely dumbfounded me when coupled with my recent quitting. It just blew my mind to realize that a very common antibiotic could make my body react so horribly to it. Strangely I begin to think that this was a horrible reaction that I could actually SEE, and to think about the damage of smoking for 7 years did to me that I cannot physically see. I realized that your body is so sensitive to chemicals and compounds that you put into it. Needless to say, I will not smoke another cigarette and hope fellow quitters or people who are thinking of quitting will do the same!

Losing the same battle again and again...

Hey folks,

Long time lurker of other subs. However, amidst my struggle to quit I found this lovely subreddit and thought I’d give this a go!

I’m 22 years old, and have been smoking for the past 3-4 years (on and off). Reality kicked in when I found myself struggling to admit that despite my attempts to quit, I still haven’t. It was as though I convinced myself that wanting to quit was enough to make me not a smoker.

My partner is very against smoking, both for health and personal reasons. I’ve hid it from them for too long, and every time they’ve found out and have been supportive (though disappointed). I rationalized hiding it from them because what you don’t know, doesn’t hurt you.. right?
Well, not entirely. 

I quit for some time, but have recently relapsed and am becoming very discouraged. I want to quit both for myself and for my partner. I thought being in a community of others fighting the same battle may be helpful. So, with all that said, I look forward to both supporting and contributing to this subreddit, and hope you can all we come me with open arms.

Thanks for reading, and stay strong folks!

TL;DR - I’m a smoker who wants to quit, and is looking forward to being a part of this community.

Anyone else get intense cravings where they almost forget they've given up?

Sometimes I'm doing something that will trigger an intense craving. It's almost like I'm back to being a smoker and I've completely forgotten that I've given up. I come to my senses pretty quickly but that cravings lingers for a little while after that.

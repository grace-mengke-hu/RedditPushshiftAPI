I'm an idiot. Help me before it's too late.

I quit for the fourth time when I graduated college on May 5th. I wasn't 100% sure about my decision, so (like an idiot) I took the seven unopened packs I had and left them at the house I'm renting for law school. Lived with parents in a neighboring state for the summer and didn't smoke for 72 days. After moving into my new place Saturday, I smoked two (like an idiot), and I've probably had eight since then. I know I need to get rid of the rest of this carton before I start chaining again. 

1. Why should I destroy the rest of these cigs? (Be harsh)

2. How should I do it?

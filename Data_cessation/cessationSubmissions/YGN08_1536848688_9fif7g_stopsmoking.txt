Sleepiness after 4 hours awake

I stoped smoking 9 weeks ago but still suffer from drowsiness and sleepiness. My energy for doing stuff lasts around 4 hours and after that I just want to have a nap. 

After googling Iâ€™ve seen that some people suffer from sleepiness up to 6 months after going cold turkey (as I did). Does anyone here have some tip on what I should do about this? And is there any way to speed up the recovery process?

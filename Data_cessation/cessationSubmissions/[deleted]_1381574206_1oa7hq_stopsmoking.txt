Disproven excuses

When I was first quitting, I lamented the fact that I would no longer have cigarette breaks to make my work shifts go faster, since it helped me carve my nights (I'm a bartender) into manageable chunks.  i.e.  "It may be 9 hours until the end of my shift, but only 45 minutes until my next smoke break!"

I got to thinking though, not smoking actually makes my time pass faster because I'm not looking at the clock and counting the minutes until cigarette time. 

  I actually find myself glancing at a clock and thinking  "Wow, is it (whatever time) already??"  

That never happened when I was a smoker, I always had one eye on the clock waiting for that time I could justify going out for another one.


Any one else have any examples of excuses to keep smoking that turned out to be the exact opposite?


(Sorry for typos or incomprehension, I'm a little drunk on mobile at 3:30am after a 12hr shift, I cannot brain so gud rite nowe.)

For every week I don't buy a pack of cigarettes I'm going to put $20 aside for a new computer

I've been meaning to build my self a gaming PC for the longest time, and I figure it's about time to achive that goal. I want to also quit smoking for good. Why not kill two birds with one stone? My idea is to continue my lifestyle and budget as if I am still spending money on darts, but I'm going to build a savings with that money instead. The only change will be that I won't be sucking my life away.

I quit for a few months, but started up again a couple months back. I figure that I go through about 2 or 3 packs a week - bit of a light smoker. I resubscribed to /r/stopsmoking and with the help of the feeds coming from /r/buildapc, I'm hoping to accomplish this.

Wish me luck!

What to do with the behavioural addiction?

Hi, im Alex, 29.

*I*n one week from now, i'll be trying to kick the habbit.

The first 16 days are going to be "fairly" easy - im going to a vacation with my wife and well, i don't smoke near her, sort of a habbit since she is non smoker.

But the thing is, i've never had that much of a physical thing for it (well, i had, but not that big of a deal), and it always been more like a behavioural addiction to me.

The problems begin when i come back, and start going to work etc... I'm used to taking breaks at work, breaks at life etc with the smokes. I thought about - hey, lets do the same without it. But in reality, managing over 30 people, the second you put that cig away is the second people start calling you back to work. you cant have the break.

I dont run, i dont go for meditation or yoga, im a simple man.

How do you kick off the behavioural habbits at work? those seem the hardest. I'm afraid for days 17-30.

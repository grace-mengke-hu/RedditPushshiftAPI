An Android App to monitor progress

Can anyone suggest one?

One thing that I do struggle with is removing the rush of an 'instant gratification' in the things I enjoy and / or do.  This applies to work, school, women, smoking, etc.

I think if I were to track my quitting smoking progress, I would likely be able to 'visualise' my progress.  I've been poking around Google Play, but I would like to hear from others if they have a suggestion or an underrated application I could try out.

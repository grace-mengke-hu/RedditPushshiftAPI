Haven't smoked in four days. I don't feel any symptoms of withdrawal or really much of an urge to smoke beyond boredom

I've smoked for about nine months now, American spirit blues, about four a day average, and I decided to stop. So far I haven't really felt any cravings. When do things get bad and what should I expect?

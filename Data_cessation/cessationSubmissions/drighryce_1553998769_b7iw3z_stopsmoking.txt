3 days nicotine free! Any advice?

After smoking for 6 years and vaping for almost 2 I've finally dropped down from 6 to 3 and then 0 within a month after two years of staying at a 6 nic and various strengths of salt nics. 

I'm feeling okay so far but what's a good rule of thumb to stop vaping now that I'm down to 0? I'm vaping a pretty strong menthol while I'm getting over the nicotine withdrawals and so I still have the hand to mouth motion but whens a good time for me to quit altogether? I just don't want this transition to be any hard than what it is. Thanks to anyone who responds!

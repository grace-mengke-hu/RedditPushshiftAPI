Scary/rough mornings

Tomorrow morning is 21 days for me not smoking, I have been doing yoga and exercising this past week along with meditation but when I wake up in the mornings I am jolted with bouts of anxiety and shakiness. I can deal with it during the day but when you are woken up to it it’s quite scary. Has or is anyone else had this happen to them and any tips that may help ease this. I’m also only able to sleep for about 5-6 hours before being woke up. Thanks in advance for any and all useful information. And I will continue to not smoke and I will conquer these demons inside of me!

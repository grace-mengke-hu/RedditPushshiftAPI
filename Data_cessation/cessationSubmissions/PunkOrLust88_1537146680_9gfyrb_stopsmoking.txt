Giving it another go, thanks guys

After many failed attempts at quitting this month, I’m gonna give it another serious go tomorrow.   I just wanted to thank each and every person in this community who’s reached out or offered me encouragement in some way.  I am truly touched and amazed at the unwavering support and kindness everyone has for each other here, it’s genuinely been a very empowering outlet and resource for me, I appreciate you all.

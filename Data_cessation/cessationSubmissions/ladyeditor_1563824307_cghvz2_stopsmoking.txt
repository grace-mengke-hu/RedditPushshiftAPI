Seeking advice on quitting with Juul?

Hi team, 

This is my third quit since early June (two weeks, then three days, then most of a day). Now I'm heading into hour 10. 

A friend who quit recently said her Juul vape helped a lot. I've always been a believer that it's trading one addiction for another, but clearly I need a different tactic than the one I took before. So I bought one. If nothing else it cost less than a week of smoking cigarettes. 

Juul users: what's your quit been like? Benefits, challenges, stuff to keep in mind?

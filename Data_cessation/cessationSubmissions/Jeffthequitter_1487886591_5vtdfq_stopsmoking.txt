My new montra

Seven plus days in for me today--I'll make eight by midnight.  Paul Simon is one of my favorite artists, and a song of his reminds me of my love affair with smoking.  "The problem is all inside your head she said to me.  The answer is easy if you take it logically.  I'd like to help you with your struggles to be free, there must be fifty ways to leave your lover.  You just slip the back Jack, Hop off the bus Gus, Make a new plan Stan, no need to bbe coy Roy, just get yourself free"

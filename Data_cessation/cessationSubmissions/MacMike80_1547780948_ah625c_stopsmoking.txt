Day 16 over

Going to bed now and tomorrow will be the start of day 17.  Today was not too bad; a few cravings that passed quickly.  Yesterday and the day before were very difficult- I don’t know why.  
But I’m hoping moving forward it gets easier and easier.  
I am now confidently saying: I AM a non-smoker.   
Not another puff, no matter what.

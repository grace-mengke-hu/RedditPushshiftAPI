Something strange happened today...

First off, it has been awhile now since I stopped (over a year). My roommate still smokes and so does my boss. Usually I don't care if my roommate smokes in my car but, this morning I get in my truck and notice a strong odor of smoke. Normally I would sit for a second and reminisce over the ol' days when I was a smoker but this time was different. It actually stunk! 

Let's fast forward to lunch time now... 

So, typically I ride with my boss to lunch and he will smoke on the way to wherever we are going. He lit up a smoke and instead of having that usual initial craving for a cigarette I reached for my window so I could get some fresh air. They smell was horrible! I normally love (even as an exsmoker) that first puff of smoke right after someone lights up...

So this led me to the questions: Has this happened to anyone else? All of a sudden you hate the smell of cigg smoke? Is this what all the non-smokers always complain about? Am I finally letting go of the fact that I was a smoker? 

Anyhow.. I just wanted to share that with you guys. It kind of caught me off guard. :)

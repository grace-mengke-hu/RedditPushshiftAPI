Weird job schedule, long boring shifts and I always start back up smoking.

So I have a job where I work 7 straight days, 12 hour shifts, with lots of downtime. It's a paradise of excuses to smoke. Bordem, long hours and occasionally stressful.

 I'm usually great at quitting for my following 7 days off when I spend a solid week with my family having fun and doing chores, but every work week I fall back into my same rut. I'll feel anxious about the work week and buy a pack. I always tell myself that this time will be different, I'll only have one a day, blah blah blah. Even when I was a regular smoker I would be about a 1-and-a-half pack a week guy. I usually have one or two the first shift, but by day two or three I'm up to 5-6 a day again.

Anyone have any advice for avoiding the "smoke due to bordem" or "only at work" ruts I keep finding myself in?

Thanks

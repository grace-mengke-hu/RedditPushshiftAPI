The 3 & 2 method.

After trying to give up using countless times I've recently quit cold turkey from smoking 20 a day for 5 years and have been clean for about 4 months now so I though I would share my experience and any points that might help you chumly bunch.

I found that there were 2 key points within the first month of quitting, Day 3 and week 2. I feel that anyone wanting to quit should make note of the following points, that should hopefully help in the mental battle that awaits you:

* Stopping: There should be no preparation to quit. Just stop, choose a random cigarette when the mood takes you and just don't smoke it, your journey begins now and with as little fuss as possible! Don't wait until the last cig in the pack or say you will quit on the next cig, it has to be a spontaneous act. Don't build the moment up to be more than it is, this will let you focus on the actual process of quitting and give the whole ordeal less gravitas than it deserves.

**I would advise not reading the rest until you have achieved the above and stopped, but hey if you decide that moment is now, then lets go!**

* Initial attitude: So you've stopped without a fuss, well done but don't focus on it, that's behind you now and to be honest this is no big feat. You now face the worst 3 days since you first picked up a cigarette. I cant give you too many pointers, however the following helped me: for the next 3 days You are now the most pig headed stubborn and selfish person on the face of the planet, all that matters is not smoking for these next 3 days. Try to control your environment as best you can, stay away from triggers such as alcohol, coffee, other smokers, people that have a pulse, and life itself in general. Keep your mind focused on the fact that it will get worse minute after minute, hour after hour... Yes WORSE not better, worse. Forget the long term here, forget being cough free, forget reduced risk of cancer, forget it all. YOUR ONLY GOAL IN LIFE RIGHT NOW IS GETTING TO 3 DAYS WITHOUT A CIG. 

* Day 3: Worst day of your life, may sound like a bad thing but it's actually a positive. It doesn't get worse than this, let that sink in... It is all going to get easier from now on, minute after minute, hour after hour. Embrace how awful day 3 feels, make sure you take a mental note of the stress and pain your going through, this is important for the next step.

* Day 3 to Week 2: So day 3 is done and your now on the long road to your next goal, the end of week 2. During this stage, your going to still have some serious issues, but it's important to think back to day 3 and notice how far you've come in terms of stress levels and cravings. Day 4/5/6 aren't going to feel much better but they will feel better, and its that progress which you should focus on, its never going to feel as bad as day 3 again. By mid way through week 2 you should notice a marked improvement and each craving should feel like a cakewalk in comparison to day 3. Remember it's all about your attitude, yes you want a cigarette, and yes it feels horrible, but it doesn't feel as bad as it did on day 3 and tomorrow its going to be even better so your not going to have another smoke! During this period is when your going to be most susceptible to relapses so although its going to make life even worse I would suggest you avoid and triggers, this means not going to the bars/clubs, not having a coffee, staying away from friends who smoke and generally being a hermit. It sucks but it's only 2 weeks and its 100% worth it.

* End of week 2: You've quit. 

* Moving forward: So now your past the 2 week mark you can adjust your attitude and focus, it's no longer a battle, you've won. Don't get me wrong, your still going to feel the odd craving or pang but remember back to day 3 and laugh at how weak and puny the cravings are and how they are mainly situational (i.e you've just had a beer/coffee/argument), these are the habitual scars of smoking and I still experience them myself but they are easily brushed aside. Your next and final big test will be avoiding the temptation to have a smoke when your at your weakest (drunk/stressed), just remember you dont smoke. yes you used to smoke, but you've quit, time is no longer a factor here because your past the 2 week mark, your just the same as someone who quit 50 years ago, your no longer a smoker and having a cigarette is as ludicrous an idea as starting smoking in the first place.

So thats my bit on the whole ordeal. If you have any questions about my journey so far let me know and I will happily help :)

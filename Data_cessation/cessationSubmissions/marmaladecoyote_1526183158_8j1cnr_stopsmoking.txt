Giving it another go

About a year and a half ago I made my first real attempt at quitting. My habit wasn’t terrible, but it was there. I was 31 at the time. Had been smoking regularly since 15.  At worst my habit was 3-4 packs per week.  But I usually settled in the 2-3 range.  Anyway my physician just said try. So I did. I went with Wellbutrin. It worked for me. I stopped smoking for the better part of 4 months.  I was also sober at this time.  Then I started drinking again, then the Wellbutrin alcohol combo made me feel terrible so I stopped taking the pills, then I started smoking again.  Anyway a couple months of cigs. Then I put them down and went to a vape. No smoking cigs, just vape for probably the last year. Well long story short I went on a party trip last weekend and I thought I deserved to smoke real cigs. Hell. It was vacation. Drank myself into oblivion each day/night and smoked 4 packs in 3 days. After that trip I was so hungover and sick I decided I never wanted to do that shit again. 

I’m on day 6, no nicotine of any kind.  Been a rough go. Short fuse, very irritable but I know it will pass.  It will be worth it to finally, finally be nicotine free and not having to use a prescription.  I won’t smoke today.

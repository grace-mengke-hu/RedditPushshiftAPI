How do you do it? I mean, really... How do you stick with the plan without talking yourself out of it?

   I'm 26 years old and have been smoking for ten years now. I've tried quitting numerous times and always end up talking myself out of it. The closest I have ever gotten was with dipping. I dipped for about two weeks without a single cigarette. Why couldn't I go any further? Stress, mostly. And then I seen how bad dipping was turning my teeth an awful color.   
     I've tried Chantix before, but the side effects were too great (blurry vision really). I also really didn't like the idea of being on a pill that was supposed to be an anti-d. So I that up.    
     Patches? Didn't work one bit. I would often find myself forgetting about the patch and that I was supposed to quit and end up with a cigarette in my mouth.     
     Gum? The taste was so bad that I'd rather smoke a Marlboro rolled in Pakistan (these are horrible).    
      Electronic cigarette? Tried twice. No dice.    
     So how's this willpower working for me? It's not. I've tried a lot and somehow I end up talking myself out if it and convince myself that its not a big deal because I'm still young. Would I feel better if I quit? Sure, but I already feel good and pretty active already. 
    
    So my question to you r/stopsmoking, how do you do it? How do you stick to the plan?

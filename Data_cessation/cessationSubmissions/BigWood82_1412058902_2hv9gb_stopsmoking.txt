8 days and 23 hours down...

I quit while at work in New Mexico,  really just got trapped on location by flood waters and no way out  for 4 days.   I'm almost 9 days into my quit and really not doing bad.  It's pretty rough at first when I  wake up, but after an hour or so I start feeling better. I'll head back to Texas in the morning for my 9 hour drive home, and my first time driving since I quit.  I find it's not bad as long as I'm occupied. When I can't find anything to keep my mind busy I start getting anxious and in a shity mood.  It'll be nice to see my wife and girls though so that should help on my 2 weeks off. Just gotta stay away from the cold beer.

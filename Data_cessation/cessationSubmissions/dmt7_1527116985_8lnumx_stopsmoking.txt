Anyone else quit with Champix?

I have been smoke free for about a month &amp; a half now and still taking champix. I was all excited first but now I feel miserable &amp; sick. The cravings have gone but most times I feel nauseous despite the vast amount of water I drink. I’m hungrier than I was but then once I fill the hunger void, I feel literally sick to my stomach with gastric issues (I’ll spare the details). I’m not enjoying myself and I thought it would be better than it has been. I’m also bloated and all I feel like doing is sleeping because if the nausea. I won’t start smoking but please tell me it will get better!!! I need to hear that. Also if you have any suggestions for the nausea I’d love to hear your input. Also going through some depression and not wanting to do anything. I’m trying to “hang in there” but wow I feel like crap.

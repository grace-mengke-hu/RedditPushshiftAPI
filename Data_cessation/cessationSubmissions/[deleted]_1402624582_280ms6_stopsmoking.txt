Day 2

I just wanted to share since I've been a lurker for a few months now. I have been a pretty steady smoker for a while, but recently got a nasty cold and have since had no desire to touch the stuff. I'm going to try to keep the momentum going since now is as good a time as any. So far it's finding new fillers for my routine that have given me the most trouble, not the desire to sit and smoke so that in itself is super encouraging for me. Maybe I'll pick up my guitar or grab the free weights the next time I would normally go outside to grab a smoke and pass the time. Hopefully this isn't wishful thinking. Thanks for letting me vent /r/stopsmoking!

Day 12, cravings worse than the first week.

Here I am on day 12, and unfortunately my cravings are worse than before. My wife is experiencing the same thing. We aren't going to smoke, that's for sure, but is this normal?

How long until my cravings stop? I'm not talking about wanting a cigarette here and there, but this is actually making me pretty grumpy.

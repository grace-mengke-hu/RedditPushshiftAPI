Hard to quit although I have all the reasons to do.

I'm 26 years old and I smoke since I was 16. I can't find the willpower to do it I mean it seems just too hard. I find smoking very enjoyable and I consider every cigarette a cheerful small event.
The sad part is that all my health issues are somehow related to smoking. Some hearth issues, stomach issues, teeth issues. I recently got diagnosed with herniated disc and ankle arthrosis and after some research on the internet I found that even those conditions are influenced by cigarettes...
There were many times when I tried to quit but I failed every time. The range was between one to several days of not smoking. I even tried e-cigs but without success.
There was one time when I managed to quit for about a month and a half. But the saddest part is that the event happened because my father got diagnosed with lung cancer and that ruined me. I was very ashamed of myself when I relapsed because my father was always telling my mom when I was doing something wrong: "it's not that important that he failed some classes or the other things he did, I just wish him to quit smoking. if he does that he'll be fine".
I don't remember the things that made me happy before stared smoking. When I did this, I also started my social life, as before that I was kind of a loner. I started meeting new people, going to events and parties, joined a band, meeting girls, what a teenage dream ... There is a very strong bond between cigarettes and who I am today.
I am mentally weak and I usually do whatever I like and I find very hard to make sacrifices, whatever could them be.
I even started reading that Allan Carr book but it didn't affect me by any means ... I might consider to read it again with another perspective.
I also like to drink from time to time, but I find abstaining and drinking almost impossible.
Any thoughts and advices are welcomed.
Love you all.

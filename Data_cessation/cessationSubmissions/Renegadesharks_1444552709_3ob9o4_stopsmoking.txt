Going crazy

I smoked for 12 years 20 a day was easy never really felt the need to stop even though I knew the facts. I stopped 4 days ago, this is my 5th day of not smoking I'm on the patches and spray the habit is what I'm battling first. I'm finding it moderately difficult. I feel like when I breathe I'm missing the smoke it feels ultra wierd my brain is telling me to smoke yet I'm telling it to "go do one" and its reply is "OK feel like shit, go crazy I'm gonna fuck you up". Luckly I have a great fiancé giving me some awesome support and my reason for quitting this shitty addiction means a lot to me ( my fiancé is pregnant we spent a long time trying and it means everything to me that we are to start a family after 11 years of being together). I'm writing this story to physically tell my brain that this addiciton, this shitty meaning of life does not own me and I will be much better for it. My family will be much better for it and I will beat this shitty feeling. If your reading this write your shitty feeling down then tell it to fuck off. You're better than that.

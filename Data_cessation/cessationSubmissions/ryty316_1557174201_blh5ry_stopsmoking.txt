If I can do it, anyone can

Hi guys,

&amp;#x200B;

Tomorrow (Tuesday 7th May) I'm going to hit 2 milestones I haven't reached for over 13 years:  


5 weeks without tobacco 

5 days without any nicotine 

&amp;#x200B;

Before I quit, I didn't smoke tobacco much on it's own but i LOVED smoking joints (UK here, so our joints contain tobacco &amp; weed). I'm lucky enough to be able to smoke at work so I would typically roll &amp; smoke7-8 small joints in a baby rizla each day. It was getting to the point where as soon as I put out one joint I was having cravings for another. Not only did I not want to quit, but I actually enjoyed smoking and everything that came with it. The idea of not smoking made me anxious and filled we with dread. 

&amp;#x200B;

I purchased a nicotine vape and a hand-held cannabis vape with the idea of getting rid of tobacco entirely. I was vaping 3mg nicotine juice for 1 month and I've moved to 0mg nicotine as of 5 days ago and doing well. Vaping cannabis instead of smoking it has made me realised I smoked far too much and my intake of cannabis has reduced to approx. 1 third of what it used to be.

I just want to say I wrote myself off as a last cause and thought I would likely never quit smoking â€” but this has been so much more easier than I thought it would be. So if anyone out there has doubts they can quit or they feel like they are faltering........if I can do it, anyone can.

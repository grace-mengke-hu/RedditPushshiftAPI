44 days in, no looking back! Super proud. But my nose feels super weird. Anyone else have this problem?

I used the patches and I'm not looking back, some days I even forget to put one on and I hardly think about it.  It's great!  Would have been 9 years, a pack a day in October.  So relieved and happy and I notice so many differences!  

One difference I'm not happy with.  One of my nostrils has been screwed up since about 2 weeks ago.  I feel no symptoms of sickness or nasal congestion.  My left nostril is just plugged.  There's nothing in there though!  It's so damn frustrating.  I blow it, nothing comes out half the time.  And whatever does come out, it's nothing huge.  

My silly assumption is that it's because the cilia have become operational again and they're struggling to get the particulates of smoking out of my sinus.  That's a complete speculation though, because sometimes when I do blow my nose, bright yellow mucus comes out, like it would when I'm sick.  Has anyone else had this issue?   Other than my most likely inaccurate diagnoses, I'm at a loss.

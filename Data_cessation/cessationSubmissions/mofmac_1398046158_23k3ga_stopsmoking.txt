this addiction has made me a feign

ive tried quitting multiple times this past 6 months, with a feeble 1-2 weeks of abstaining, recently i relapsed by picking up butts in my friends ashtray, being a student i can be strapped for cash and there have been occasions where i've succumbed to feigning butts on the streets and ashtrays, this depravity is my realization that im a f**khead and need to quit, and this support network looks like a brilliant means of alleviating some of the difficulty

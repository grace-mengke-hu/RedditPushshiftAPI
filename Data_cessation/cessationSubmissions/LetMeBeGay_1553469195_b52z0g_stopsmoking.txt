I Have ONE Cigarette Left

... And I really don’t want to buy anymore. I feel like a slave. My body hurts, I wake up wheezing, I feel empty when I go too long without one. And it’s gross. It’s disgusting. I hate smelling like this. My teeth are starting to stain.

Anyways, I have just one cigarette left and so I’d like for everyone to share the single-most detrimental thing that they did to help them succeed when quitting smoking.

I really want to stop this time, for good. I can literally feel it starting to destroy my body.

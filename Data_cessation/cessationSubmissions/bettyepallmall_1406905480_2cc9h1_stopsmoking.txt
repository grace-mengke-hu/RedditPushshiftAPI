Out of patches, out of money for a week!

I haven't smoked a cigarette since 6 p.m. on 07/27 and I'm very proud of myself, but because it has been such a short time I'm starting to get worried. I was a pack a day smoker, so I started on step 1 (21mg) nicotine patches. I was using some before actually quitting, and gave my boyfriend a couple to try and basically I only have 1 left. I've got one already on today, then 1 for tomorrow.

I am pretty broke at the moment and am worried I might slip up. I am confident in myself right now, I haven't cheated, I haven't even wanted to cheat! Most of me feel a like I'm just done and could never smoke another cigarette in my life, but part of me wonders if I just feel that way because I'm still getting nicotine.

I'm mostly just venting today. Words of encouragement would be appreciated! Keep it up guys! :)

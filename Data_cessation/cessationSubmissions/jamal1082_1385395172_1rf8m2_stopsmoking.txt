2 weeks cold turkey - doing great!

Dunno what was different this time - Maybe it was Allen Carr's book, maybe it was going to the memorial for my friend's father who passed away from lung cancer, but either way - I have made it over 2 weeks without any nicotine (actually well over a month without a cigarette, but I was chewing tobacco for a few weeks there). Got a few friends and employees quitting with me too. I haven't cheated at all, and I haven't backed down from any potential triggers (i.e. beers with friends). 

So far so good, thanks much to everyone on this sub!

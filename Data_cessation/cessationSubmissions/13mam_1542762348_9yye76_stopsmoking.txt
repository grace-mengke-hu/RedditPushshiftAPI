Been smoking weed for 4 years almost everyday ! Should I stop ? Want to see if anyone has any good experiences after quitting .

I’ve been smoking weed for the last 4 years . I smoke everyday about three times unless I don’t have money that day . The days I go without smoking i don’t feel any withdraws but it’s still on my mind thinking how imma get the couple of bucks to buy a gram or something but it’s not a bad wanting feeling . I feel like if stopped smoking I could also save money and maybe have a better life .

All in all I just want to see if there is anyone who stopped smoking and thinks they are living a better life . If anything  changed after stopping for the better or worse .

Okay help!

Alright guys it's been 4 days for me! It's always easy to quit when I'm with the family, but as soon as I get back into my life routine I pick up a pack.... aaaand I go home tomorrow. Any advice on staying smoke free even at work/at my local coffee shop/at home with a roommate who smokes?

One whole week! One whole week!

Oh boy it’s been a tough week, but every day gets a bit easier. 

Feeling especially proud of myself because I’ve been out for drinks with friends (some of who are smokers / it feels like everyone in Brooklyn smoke, sigh) and dealt with super-stress at work and didn’t cave a single time. 

Seven days may seem small, but they’re my seven days! Thank you all for sharing your advice, listening to me rant, sending your support.

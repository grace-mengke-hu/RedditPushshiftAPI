This Sucks

To be honest, I pretty much just want to whine. My husband and I want to quit, like actually want to. We are on the patch. My cravings are really bad and seem to last quite a while (some are over an hour long). With our work hours, I tend to take care of our 1 and 2 year old most of the time..for non-parents it's a SUPER fun age (read tantrums and fighting constantly). I've been doing my best to stay busy, but then my mind wanders to the fact my husband is probably having a smoke on his break at work (not a lack of trust, he has people from work he bums from, he even bought have a pack from a guy a few days ago) and I get bitter and want one even worse. Please tell me this gets less suckish! If anybody has an app to recommend, I'd appreciate it.

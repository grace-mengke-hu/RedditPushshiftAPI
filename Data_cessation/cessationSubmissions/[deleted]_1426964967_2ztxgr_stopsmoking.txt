The butt stops here...

It has been about 40 hours now without a cigarette.  I have an e cig with a small amount of nicotine that's been helping me through. Last night we had company over, and despite 3 out of 4 of our guests smoking, I managed to not join them for even a single puff! Pretty proud of myself!

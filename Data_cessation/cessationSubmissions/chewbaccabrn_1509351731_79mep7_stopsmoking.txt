Two days

I quit smoking two days ago and have been religiously chewing gum almost the entire time. Now my mouth &amp; jaw are super sore. 

Is this normal? Will this go away? I am afraid that if I stop chewing, I will smoke. I have even gone so far as to consider smoking my old butts...gross. 

Are there other symptoms I should look out for while quitting? In the ten years I have smoked, I believe this is my most sincere attempt. I don't want to screw this up.

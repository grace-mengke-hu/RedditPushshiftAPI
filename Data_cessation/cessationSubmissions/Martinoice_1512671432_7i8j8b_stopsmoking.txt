I think I want to quit.

I found this subreddit today and it has kickstarted ideas in my head. So thank you for that. 

I want to quit but I'm scared. I started smoking because I Was bored. (amazing reason to start, I know.) I had nothing going on in life and I just accepted things. 

But now, almost two years later, I have an amazing boyfriend a beautiful dog, and loads of new friends. I want to quit for my man and my dog. But I know that I need to stop for me, because life can take sudden turns, and If the reason I stop disappears then I know I'll just start again. I don't really know why I'm writing this. I think it helps me somehow.

I do see a way though. I've recently started improving myself. Going to the gym three times a week, gotten more efficient at cleaning my apartment, starting seeing someone to talk to and I'm starting school next year to get an education. I dropped out of school at a young age. 

The thing is now that I'm actually doing something I'm starting to feel self worth. And I think if I can make that self worth grow just a bit more I can quit, for me. I guess I'll just keep improving and maybe update you guys about how it goes.

To everyone who quit, I am proud. To everyone trying, I am proud. And eventually I will be proud of myself. I swear.

Day 1 quit for a 24 year smoker.

I told my brother (who currentlu vapes) that i'm quitting today and he sent me a link to thus forum. Is that what they call these of Reddit? I dont know- i just joined today specifically so i can post here and share. Anyway, i'm about 10 hours into the quit and finding it very difficult to concentrate at work. I think about it every minute but i kind of expected that since i havent had a single non-smoking day since i was about 14. Every time i get a craving now I go outside and take a lap around tbe office building. I just thought about how i would have typically smoked 7 cigs by now and it's a half hour to noon. This is my first shot at quitting, ever. Ive never wanted to quit before but i think im finally fed up with the habit. 

It's been an interesting month. I broke up with my girlfriend of 4 years, started walking for excercise multiple miles per day and have lost about 7 lbs. so far, and quit smoking today. Guess i saved the best for last. Hope i can keep all of it up.....

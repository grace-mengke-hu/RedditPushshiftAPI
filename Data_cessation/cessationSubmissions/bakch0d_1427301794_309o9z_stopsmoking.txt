Miles to go... one step at a time

So I decided to kick the cancer sticks out of my life 2 days ago. Yesterday was the first full day in last 7 years when I was able to go smoke free. Whenever I felt the need of smoking, I browsed through this community reading threads of people making successful attempts and that gave me strength. So many thanks guys !! 

A few notes from the first day without smoke:

* Water is magical. I kept drinking cold water yesterday and it helped get through the cravings. Lets see how it goes today. 

* Concentration was really bad, like I could not focus on my work and every few minutes I had to push myself to stop thinking about smoking and try to divert my mind to work.

* I was getting pretty cranky and edgy towards the end of the day. I realized that its probably a withdrawal symptom and tried a few deep breaths and to my surprise I became calm within a few minutes.

* Probably just my subconscious playing games but I was feeling very warm and sweated a lot last night. 

* I feel a bit congested this morning with general cough. 

Thanks for reading guys and thank you so much for this community.

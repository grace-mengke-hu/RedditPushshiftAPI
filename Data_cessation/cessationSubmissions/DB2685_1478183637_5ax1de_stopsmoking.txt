Day 5 and I didn't smoke at a concert last night!

Myself and one of my drinking buddies decided to quit Nov 1. I had my last cig on Oct 29th just before midnight at a wedding. I was a sporadic/social smoker. But it had been creeping into my daily life at work and most weekends (because I drink/go out most weekends) Last night I went to a Yellowcard concert in Milwaukee. Usually the event would be one of my GO times. But I barely even missed it. I was with a different friend who never smokes so it definitely helped. For me the hard part is going to be when drinking and walking past all the smokers outside bars. Or those few times when I get very stressed or anxious. 

It's a steel wall in my mind that Oct 29th date. I dont smoke anymore, its not doing me any good and I always always felt like crap after any cigarette. Hangovers were 1000x worse. I feel as though a bourdon has been lifted. I dont need to worry "Do I have enough for the weekend?" or "I need to smoke this one quick" when traveling, I wont stink, feel bad or need to leave a non-smoking friend alone in the bar. I feel free! Im clinging to that feeling for dear life! 

Heading to Chicago on Saturday- same friend as last night and I expect it should be pretty smooth sailing. Go Cubbies! Im excited to see the atmosphere down there.

Has anyone tried to quit when their spouse/partner wasn't ready and kept smoking?

I need some help guys!

My husband has attempted and failed several times when he has tried to quit smoking. Last week I decided that I wanted to quit with out without him but I didn't realize how difficult it would be. 

My cravings are the worst after we have dinner together because that's one of the habits we got into after we got married. Now, I feel so conflicted when he goes out to smoke because I want to join him so badly, its when we talk about our day and bring up anything else that needs to be discussed. 

Does anyone have any tips on how to deal with quitting when their spouse doesn't want to quit/can't quit? 

Thanks!

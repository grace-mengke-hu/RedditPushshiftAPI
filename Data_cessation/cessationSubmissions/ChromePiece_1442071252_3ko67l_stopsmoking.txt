I've been an addict before but nothing has me weak like cigarettes do.

I wish to quit smoking and I'm always telling myself I'll do it tomorrow. It's been 2 years since I've relapsed. I've been addicted to hardcore substances in the past and I quit. I've been clean with the exception of my tobacco addiction. Tobacco helped me with terrible withdrawals, bipolar mood swings, and the dealing with the gambit of stress I go through everyday as a truck driver. 

So to get to the point how can I deal with my very intense feelings without the deathsticks? Are there any resources or guides on how to manage my life of mood swings after cigarettes? I don't want to quit but I'm 28 and I'm so tired of the money going out, the constant want for cigarettes, smelling bad, wasted time on trips to the store, inability to perform sexually, and many health problems directly related to my habit. The cons outweigh the pros but I can't muster the strength of will like I've done with many other substances. Why am I having so much trouble with getting to the 72 hour mark?

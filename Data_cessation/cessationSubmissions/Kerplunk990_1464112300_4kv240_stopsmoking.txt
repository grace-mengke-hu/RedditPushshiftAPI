75 Days in and it's been tough recently.

Even took a hit of a Garcia vega...gross as usual but the thing is recently is i'm having *nostalgic* thoughts about cigarettes. Like what the hell? a month ago i could go a whole day without even thinking about them. Is this normal around the 2-3 month mark?

Here we go!

The time has come. I've just finished Allen Carr's book. I'm smoking my final cigarette right now! By the time I'm done typing, I will no longer be a smoker!!! I just wanted to say thanks to everyone on this subreddit who recommended Allen carr's book. If you haven't read it, do it now! Best of luck to everyone. Have an amazing day :)

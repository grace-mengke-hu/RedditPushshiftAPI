Reaching the year mark

I smoked my last cigarette in the first week of January (4th or 5th i forget which).  I promised myself I wouldn't smoke for the rest of the year and I've kept that promise but I crave cigarettes every day without exception and now that i'm reaching the end of the year it's just getting worse and worse.  I have a beautiful gamer wife who promised she'd take the kids and leave me if i started again... it's getting to the point where I have trouble thinking about anything else when I'm not at work.  Has anyone else had experience with persistent intense cravings lasting this long (11 months now)?  Did you relapse or not and if not, do you have any coping strategies I can use?

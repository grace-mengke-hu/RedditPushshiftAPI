200 days in!

Eyo guys, 200 days in today, I've also celebrate my first non-smoker birthday(2 days ago). 
After such amount of time, cravings are nearly absent, I think that I have a craving once/twice a month, and not regarding the cigarette itself, but more because of the habit that I've developed(this come to me only when I am drunk, like "ok give me another beer, and light one up" was my routine during parties so it it strongly printed in my mind, but I am still rewiring so it's just a matter of time).

stop smoking is the best thing that I've accomplished. 
Go Guys, you can succeed!

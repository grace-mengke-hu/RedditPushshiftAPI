I just need to vent a little...

When I get done eating I have a huge craving (every. single. time.), and when I drink coffee for drink alcohol, I have huge cravings.  I have had half a smoke when I was drunk, since I've quit, and I did not like it at all, and it just turned me off even more to smoking.  I think it is disgusting now.  The smell, the taste, everything.  But why do I crave it so bad?  And when I gave in that one time, it sucked ass.  Yet I still have these cravings as if I were still smoking a pack a day.  I just don't get it.

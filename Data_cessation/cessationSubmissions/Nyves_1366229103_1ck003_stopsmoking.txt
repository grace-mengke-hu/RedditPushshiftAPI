I'm at that point where I'm ready to rip out someone's esophagus and feed it to their mother.

I'm usually a pretty mild-mannered guy. I'm only 19 and I've been smoking for a year and a half. I've seen others who have been smoking for 30 years and are having a terrible time quitting. I don't want that to ever happen to me. It's been a difficult 3 days and 2 hours for me, and I don't want to ever go back. 

This day has already been tough. Walking in on my roommate and his girlfriend going at it like wild apes, then I leave my backpack at my friend's place and I needed to transport an eight page essay from my dorm to class then math comes along and I can't even go because my stuff is in my backpack. I feel like I'm going through the devil's gauntlet and I'm barely surviving. I need to go boxing or something.

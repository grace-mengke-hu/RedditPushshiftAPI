Relapse after 3 days

Oh damn I'm so sad I couldn't stay clean. Days 2 and 3 were really difficult and I just didn't make it.
But... I'm still on the fight. I'm not going back to 10 cigs a day, no sir. My next goal will be 5 days out. I know it is not really quitting, but it's already a great achievment for me.
I'm reading to your suggestions and wise words.

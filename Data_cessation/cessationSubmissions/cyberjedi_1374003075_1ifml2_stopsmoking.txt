Safe time to start drinking again?

I quit drinking beer when I quit smoking. I really like my beer but I'm worried that I will have a major craving after a beer or 2. Anyone else have experience with successfully drinking and not smoking? Not planning on getting wasted, I just want to have a few beers.

Some weird side effects I wasn't expecting

I'm 8 days in. 120 cigarettes not smoked.

Aside from the weird intestinal stuff I'd rather not mention, the hardest part at this point is actually when I'm sleeping. I dream about smoking several times throughout the course of the night.

But here's the thing, even in my dreams I feel guilty after having caved. Even my subconscious knows my brain is tricking me into wanting nicotine. No way will I give in at this point. Stay strong, everyone!

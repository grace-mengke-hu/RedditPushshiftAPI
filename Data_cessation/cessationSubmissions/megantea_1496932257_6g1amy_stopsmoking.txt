Depression and smoking? Psychological effects of quitting

I'm on day 4 of quitting smoking cold turkey and yesterday my moods started to get out of control. I know that quitting is supposed to affect your moods a little but I was super anxious, switching from violent anger to uncontrollable sobbing off and on all day. Started having brief suicidal thoughts and panic attacks. Also crazy sexual frustration. 

I should also mention that I have severe depression and anxiety but am on medication for them both. I have not had a single day like this since before getting back on medication. Should I have talked to my psychiatrist before quitting cold turkey? Is this normal for anyone else? I don't want to smoke again if this is just a couple of days that will pass... but this is AWFUL. Advice please?

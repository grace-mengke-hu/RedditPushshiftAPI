Resetting my 8 month badge

A few years ago I quit for 2-3 months using patches. Then I caught myself at a pack a day again and reset my badge 8 months ago. I don't think that decision lasted more than an hour or two. 

I'm giving it another shot. It's expensive. It smells and tastes bad. I'm sick of all my stuff smelling like cigarettes. I get nothing out of smoking except headaches, dry lips, and ashes all over the place. 

I'm addicted and only smoke out of habit, and it's time to stop. I'm starting to eat right and exercise, and continuing to smoke means I may as well switch back to soda pop, fast food, and sitting on ass. 

No patch this time either. Time to stop my nicotine intake.

My first full day

Well, I just went my first full day with a cigarette and I swear it's the hardest thing I've done in my life. When I got off my bus from school (yes school, I'm 18 and been smoking for 2 years) I walked pass the store that I normally buy them at and I put in everything I had to not even look at the store. I was THIS close to buying them, but I didn't :). When I got home I still had half a pack left and I sat there for about 15 mins trying to throw them away and I ended up doing it. Now, all I have to do is walk pass that store everyday for a number of weeks fighting myself not to buy them. But what sucks is that my dad smokes, so I could go downstairs and get one while they aren't there, simple as that. But I already posted that my quit day was today, so let's hope I don't go back. Even though I have failed about 20 times already. Wish me luck :) 

PS: How do I get the number of days I have quit next to my name like other people? I feel like it would motivate me even more.

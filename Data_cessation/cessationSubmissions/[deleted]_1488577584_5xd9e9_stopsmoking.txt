one week...

I am 45 minutes away from one week smoke free. I have renewed confidence. I have to admit the cravings are getting weaker. Taste and smell improving. Weird dreams, but that's the patch. A helpline coach called this afternoon. We talked for almost an hour. It helped. Being here does, too. So thank you!

Day 3 at 6am. I'm going to bed before it says 3 rather than being a night owl.

This day has been unpleasant. I'm edgy and look like I hate everyone. I'm reaching out a little bit. I'm a little sad and I had the first of the negotiator in my head. 

If you could just go a month that would be so good, even if you went back to it. 
Yeah right, you're not even likely to make it to a week. 

I see me trying to slip in some way to go back, but I'm not. I've been enjoying my breathing, and coughing. I'm lightheaded, my face is red, I'm sweating but I haven't lit a smoke up. Literally everything I've done today has been half assed except that.

I'm going manic and things are about to get complicated. Whatever.
I'm am prepared for this. :)

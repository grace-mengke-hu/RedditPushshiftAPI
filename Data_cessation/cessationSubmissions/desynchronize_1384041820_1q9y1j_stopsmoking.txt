Hello, I am new to stopsmoking, but very familiar with stopdrinking. I am here because I decided to quit smoking yesterday.

So I have been smoking for about 7 years, consistently. I became an alcoholic at age 22 and finally sober 9 days today. Please, if you have any advice and tips, I would greatly appreciate it! Thank you 

P.s I am still consuming nicotine through an electronic cigarette. Any pros and cons on these are welcomed. 

Edit* I'll be 24 in January, if this helps

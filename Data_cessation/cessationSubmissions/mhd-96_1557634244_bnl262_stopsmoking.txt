How can we pass the craving for cigarettes ?!

I have mostly five days since I decided to quit smoking .. yesterday I had smoked 4 cigarettes the taste and the smell was very horrible , I couldn’t complete any one of them .. It was very painful moment to see myself weaker then a cigarette !! Which is nothing but a stupidity ..

I couldn’t allow myself to get back to this kind of slavery .. I got rid of the packet  .. I knew I will have to face the withdrawal of nicotine again but If this is the price to be free and fully responsible for my life and health .. it will be a journey of pride and awareness  .. 

Since what happened yesterday .. I deal with 
The craving from meditative prospective .. and I can say it is insignificant at all !!! .. just watch it joyfully .. it doesn’t  have to be a dramatic moment :) .. so yoga is an option for me and for you to overcome any compulsive habits , especially “shambhavi mudra “ with sadhguru ..

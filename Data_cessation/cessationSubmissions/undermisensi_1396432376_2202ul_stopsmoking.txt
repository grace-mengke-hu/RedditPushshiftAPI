Don't get complacent.

The day it started going wrong was the 1 year mark. I thought "fuck, it's been a year, I've got this" and started to not worry about smoking the odd cigarette here and there when I was drunk. Then it went to when I was bored. And now I've woken up and had a cigarette first thing every day for a week.

I don't know what I'm trying to achieve by posting this, but if there's anyone else who thinks that addiction won't come back if you give it half a chance, you're wrong.

Off to throw it all in the bin, here we go again!

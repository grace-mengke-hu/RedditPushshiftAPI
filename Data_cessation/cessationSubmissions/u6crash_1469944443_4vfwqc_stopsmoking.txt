Haven't had a smoke for a whole eleven hours...

Didn't plan this real well. 30 days ago I called a quit smoking program offered through my employer and set today (my birthday) as the quit date. I was supposed to be scaling back and doing  "mini quits" but barely cut down. Then yesterday afternoon I was down to one in the pack. I couldn't very well justify buying another when I wasn't going to have 20 in a ten hour time frame. Now I really wish I'd had that ceremonial last smoke just before midnight.

Quitting smoking again

After being a smoker for four years, I quit in 2017 when I learned I was pregnant. Mid December, I started using a juul, which apparently contains 59mg of nicotine. Man talk about a rush! Hit that thing and you can hear colors. But I have to stop because I donâ€™t want my child to have a nicotine addicted parent. Wish me luck and drop any tips for quitting smoking in the comments. The first time I quit, I did a lot of crossword puzzles and drawing to get me through it.

Need tips for quitting while working in the service industry

Hey everyone. I have been smoking for over 5 years and recently decided it's time to quit. I started smoking when I was 14/15 but my addiction really solidified when I started working in the restaurant industry at 16. I worked in a kitchen where pretty much everyone smoked, so it was a social thing to go out for a cig together but also a way to deal with the chaos on busy nights.

When I turned 19 I started a new job waitressing at a new restaurant and have been there for almost 2 years. There are still a lot of smokers there, and a bunch of the kitchen staff are guys I used to work with/smoke with at the other restaurant.

I decided this past Sunday I was going to stop smoking, and made it through Monday-Thursday smoke free (with the help of nicotine replacement). Last night I went to work and found my cravings were intensified while working. As anyone who has worked in the restaurant industry knows, pretty much the only break you get is sneaking out for a smoke during service. 

At home I can deal with my cravings by breathing through it, doing some exercise or snacking on something healthy, but at work it's much harder to do that, and over the years my smoke breaks have made themselves an integral part of my shifts.

I would love any and all help/support that I can get to help rid myself of the association between work and cigarettes.

Thanks in advance and stay strong!

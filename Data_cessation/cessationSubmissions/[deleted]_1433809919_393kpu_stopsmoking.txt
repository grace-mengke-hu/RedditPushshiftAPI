Lobbing butter tarts into the battle

I should be happy. I reached day 21 and I got that shiny new 3 badge. Instead I'm a little down, indifferent about the success, even a bit vulnerable to relapse. It's not that work or anything is stressful now. It fact things are slow and I think that's part of the problem. Anyhow I'm pulling out the big guns to prevent relapse. I'm lobbing butter tarts at my bad mood. It's working. Of course it's working. They're butter tarts!

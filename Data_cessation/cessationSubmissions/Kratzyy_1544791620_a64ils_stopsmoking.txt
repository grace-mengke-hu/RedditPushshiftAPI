Wholesome Subreddit, this is it!

This would have to be the most wholesome subreddit I’ve been in. Everyone supports each other immensely because everyone knows exactly how it feels. It’s a great utility to gain inspiration to keep moving forward with the quitting process in times of need. I’m only coming up on one week, however I’m really confident that this time I’ll be able to quit with the extra support I see on this sub. We’re in this together ladies and gentlemen!

Not another puff! Not one!

Back on the wagon again, finishing Day 8

I lurk here pretty often, found it super helpful in my first true quit.  

Was clean for two years and then made the idiot decision, "If I keep cheating, that must mean that I really want to smoke in my heart of hearts, so I should just pick it back up.  I'll quit again later."

Fast forward, it took nearly 20 months to put them back down again after intending to smoke just for January 2016.  Saw a few people with electrolarynxes (just had to look up the name, been calling them "push to talk"s) and it really struck me.  Made the consequences real concrete.

The last week was tough, but I pounded seven cups of coffee a day and got through it!  Just reset my badge, looking forward to sticking it out with all you veterans.

Thanks to everyone who sticks around in this community after their quit, y'all are an inspiration.

Cold turkey the hard way

If I can do this, you can to.  smoked 20 years.  American spirits at a pack a day for the last 6 years (super high nicotine level). First 3 days are bad.  First week sucked.  1 month later I got Labyrinthitis.  Crazy f'n dizzy.  The doctors didn't diagnosis this for another 2 months.  MRIs; crazy tests.  I would not wish Labyrinthitis on anyone.  The whole time I wondered if quitting somehow caused this.  

Cold turkey is 3 days of hell and then another boring week. My only trick was to stop smoking in the car 2 months prior to quitting. Take lots of B vitamins.  Sublingual B12 twice a day and fish oil.  Fuel that brain so the receptors can compensate. 6-12 weeks for the receptors to change.  

I'm 4 months smoke free and hope to be past the Labyrinthitis very soon.

Good luck

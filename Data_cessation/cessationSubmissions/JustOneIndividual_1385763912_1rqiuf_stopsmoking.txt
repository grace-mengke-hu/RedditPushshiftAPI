Any interest in a sponsor system?

Maybe this is a dumb idea, I don't know, and ultimately its up to the mods. If we asked people who have successfully quit for a year or more and partnered them up with someone who recently quit or wants to quit, I think it would be helpful. Someone to check in on you and encourage you
 and sympathize with you. Someone to message when you're having a tough time. I think it would be helpful if implemented successfully. Thoughts?

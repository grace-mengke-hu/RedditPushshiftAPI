23 days and still feeling the depression

I'm 23 days into my quit (smoked for 26 years). I have a prior history of depression which I'm sure is playing into this. The weird thing is that I don't really want to smoke. I can't say that I'm having cravings or having to stop myself from going to buy a pack. But, I feel empty. I wake up sad and even after working out this morning I started crying. 

My brain is having to get used to not having the hit of dopamine every hour and I understand on some level that that's a process I have to go through but man, I wish this feeling would go away.

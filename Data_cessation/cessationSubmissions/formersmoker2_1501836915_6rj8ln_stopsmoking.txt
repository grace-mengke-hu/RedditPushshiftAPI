Is quitting NRT harder than cold turkey?

2 year tobacco addict here, started smoking and went to heavy use of snus for about a year.

Recently started on NRT 3 days ago using 4mg lozenges every 2 hours as directed by the label. It hasn't been nearly as bad as trying to quit cold turkey, but isn't as terrible as I'd imagined, meaning it seems too good to be true, as I always still have an itch that isn't being satisfied 

 TL;DR, how difficult is weaning off NRT?

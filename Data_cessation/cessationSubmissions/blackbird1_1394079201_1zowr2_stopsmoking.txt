A major victory

After almost 20 years of smoking (started very young) and many failed attempts, I quit the day my asthma doctor told me that my asthma had turned in to COPD. Surprise! Today, 4 months later, I went in for my third follow up breathing test and scored better than ever. No smoking plus aerobic exercise plus yoga breathing exercises has led to major improvement for me. Granted, I am on a lot of medication to make that improvement possible and I always will be. That's pretty depressing, considering I'm only 29 yo. Still, with my upper airway at 101% and my lower airway at 70%, I feel better than I ever have (in spite of having gained weight after quitting.)
The point is - it's not too late. Every day makes a difference. Every choice makes a difference.

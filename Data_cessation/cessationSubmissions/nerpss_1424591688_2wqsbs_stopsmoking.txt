Anyone else quit as a result of an unrelated illness?

Out of nowhere, I developed a brutal sinus/lung infection that left my throat feeling like knives. Anyway, after a couple of days of brutally torturing myself for the sweet nicotine, I just stopped. I'm only on day 5 now but I'm having my first cravings. I managed to quit for 3 months a few years ago, but for some reason went back at it. The craving right now is pretty horrible, I'm not going to lie, but I think I'll get over it.

Stoped smoke cigars, but not weed.

Hi all,

I want to share with you my experience.
I'm a 27 years old guy, that smoked since 17!

I was 21 when i started smoke weed. I smoke on a daily base from a few year now.
I decided to stop smoking cigars! But not weed!
I now i'm 3 months without touching in a cigar.

But, yes, there always a but, i started to smoke more weed :3
Since i have a awesome job that they just don't care if i go to work stoned (i'm a programmer/devops/sysadmin kind of guy!) i start to smoke a joint in the morning, after lunch, and after work! Plus the ones that i normally smoke after work!

Since a week ago, i give up on smoking the morning one! And i feel ok! The one after lunch i've tried a few times. But that one is kind of hard to leave!!

I don't know now what is my objective. Maybe return to smoke only after job, or stop smoking at all. The thing is that i like to smoke weed! And i can do it! So why not?
But i'm starting to think that quited the cigars and started to smoke more weed wasn't the best solution! 

This is what i feel, and i just wanted to share with you all!
I pretty know that my english is awful and i apologize for that! 
kthxbye

80 days, 800 cigarettes not smoked.

I'm a first time poster here, but I've been following this subreddit since I quit 80 days ago. At my worst I was smoking a pack and change a day, when I quit it was about half a pack a day. That's about 800 cigarettes I haven't smoked, and that number has been a big source of encouragement for me. The Cessation Nation app has been a huge help, and I look at it whenever I catch myself wanting to smoke.

I still crave cigarettes sometimes. One recent party in particular had all my triggers: food, booze, spending time outside, even some friends smoking like crazy inside a car. I felt like it was torture, but I made it through because I realized I was the one in control. If I wanted to smoke, I could smoke. I was the only one responsible for my actions, and the one who would feel the consequences if I chose to smoke. I'm proud of the self-control I have learned, and that means more than smoking a cigarette does.

I've also been running 3-5 times a week. It's a nice way of reminding myself how much more I can breathe now. I'm headed to California in a couple weeks, with triggers galore. I'm hoping a solid running habit will help me say no when I'll be surrounded by cigs pretty much the whole time. Thank you to everyone who has posted inspiration here, and good luck to all of you!

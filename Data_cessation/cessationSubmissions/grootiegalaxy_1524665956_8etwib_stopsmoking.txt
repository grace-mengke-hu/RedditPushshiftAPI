Day 1! Again.

I'm 36 F and have smoked since I was 15.  Yesterday I made the decision I do not want to be a smoker any longer.  It's day 1 for me.  I've never quit more than a week in the past.  Going cold turkey.  It's 9am here and I would have already had 5 cigarettes today, but I haven't.  I haven't really thought much about it at all so I guess that's a good sign.  You really have to want to quit!

One year! Thank you /r/stopsmoking

I just wanted to thank this Sub-reddit. Exactly one year ago I started lurking this place, and was introduced to a lot of ways to quit. It lead me to the most popular way here, which would be  "Allen Carr's Easy Way to Stop Smoking" I bought the audiobook and everytime I had cravings I would listen to it. Next to that I got myself a badge here and used the Iphone app. The first week was the worst no doubt about it. Then there's the little voice inside you saying "You can make the cravings stop.. Just take one hit... Go ahead... It won't do any harm."

Soon after the dreams about smoking started, then coughing up mucus followed by restless leg. Eventuelly I started exercising and as time went by the thought of smoking faded away.

A year later the thought of smoking still pops up but it's very rare and will only last a few seconds. I want to tell those who just quit to not give up. It will get better guys just stay strong don't listen to the voice it's lying.

Fuck smoking.

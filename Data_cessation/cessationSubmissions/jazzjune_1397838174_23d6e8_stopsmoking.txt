Win! I didn't think about cigarettes!

I've gone through many steps (and the entire emotional spectrum) the past couple weeks...

Like wrapping my brain around the fact that I quit.

Learning to do basic tasks (like talking on the phone or drinking a beer) without a light.  Each a fresh new experience.

But every day I've definitely thought about cigarettes.   I've thought about how much I want one.   How much I miss them.  How much I hate them.  How could I ever have liked them?  How they smell different now.  What to do if offered one.   How to react when standing face to face with that wall of smokes in the gas station. ...

Even though my cravings are manageable now, and I certainly don't regret quitting. ... I still have this constant undertow of cigarettes in my brain.  Even things like checking this sub is confirmation of that.

But yesterday afternoon I totally just didn't think about smoking or cigarettes in any (positive or negative) way for like 6 whole hours.  I think this is what they mean when they say you will eventually feel like a non smoker who never smoked.

Of course it was only half a day, and here I am slightly obsessing over it.... but it felt like a win.

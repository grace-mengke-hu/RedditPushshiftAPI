I'm going to make it this time because I got a plan

Hey there. 

Quick Info: female, 25, been smoking for 11 years  

I had several attempts to quit. I always tried to approach it by doing mental work... but ended up manipulating myself every time. All this thinking and rethinking cost me so many nerves which made quitting such a stressful thing that I wasn't able to deal with it after some weeks had passed. I never made it past 3-6 months. 

So now I decided to approach it from a different angle. I got a really bad phase atm but since there's still no end in sight, I decided to quit now nevertheless. I waited for some very stressful events to pass and now I got 5 weeks of summer break ahead of me and that seems to be my best bet. 

I'm a very analytic person, but I don't feel like this helps me with quitting at all. So I'll try it without journaling, without apps and books and psychological theory this time. I know everything I need to know, but this time I'm going to apply that theoretical knowledge to practice instead of focusing on analyzing the psychological process of beating an addiction. 

I will 

- focus on what my body feels like by starting to workout again and I'll celebrate how workout will be much easier now that I'll be able to actually breathe again 

- cook myself healthy and tasty dinners instead of simply substituting cigarettes with food. Instead of analyzing meal plans and macro theories, I'll simply buy some fresh ingredients and focus more on the process of turning them into something GOOD instead of just eating it

- play all the games I've bought in the past and will enjoy the experience rather than use it as a distraction and then be frustrated because I'd think about how I'd rather smoke all the time

- read books that I actually enjoy instead of wasting time with another scientific book about addiction

- study, because I love studying and I need to prepare myself for my physics studies which I'll start in October. Studying is the only thing in the world that stops my head from spinning

- stop thinking about smoking whenever the thought crosses my mind in order to avoid doubts. Yeah, sounds shallow, but I use this to fight specific trauma related symptoms and it sometimes works well. Whenever I start debating with myself, I'll avoid these thoughts and will start to think of specific other things immediately. 

So yeah. I am not a fan of behavioural therapy, but I'm gonna give it a try this time. However, I think that the most important point is that I really want it to work this time. 

Wish me luck. Much love to everyone around here, stay strong in the fight!

Fuck smoking ...

Just got off the phone with a friend of mine, who informed me that a life-long friend of ours just passed away after a bout of pneumonia, collapsed lungs, ventilator, etc.  She was truly an awesome human and one of my favorite people when I wanted to have a good time.  Second friend this year that was a smoker that is now dead.  I know when you are in your teens or 20's, death seems like a distant concept, but I promise you life is short.  Don't make it shorter.  Keep up the fight.

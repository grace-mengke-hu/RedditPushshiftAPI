Quitting today

Hey everyone, so I started smoking since I was 18 years old and now I’m almost 28, so ten years of abusing and destroying my health and body. I have reached to a point where I can no longer continue. Don’t get me wrong, thankfully I haven’t reached to a stage where it’s too late. However, I just can’t seem to enjoy life with cigarettes anymore. Recently, my coughing is becoming worse, fatigued easily, and the worst of all is that constant tight feeling in the chest and quite frankly I can’t take it anymore. I’ve started working out about 6 months ago and noticed that my stamina and physical well-being have reached a ceiling due to smoking and I can’t get better while continuing smoking. I have attempted quitting hundreds of times, and keep failing. My two biggest triggers would be that empty feeling and loss of identity since I have pictured myself as a smoker always which causes a depression every time I quit. Has anyone ever experience that feeling? (please let me know). 

Anyway, here’s to a better life! And I wish you all a happy and smoke-free life! 

Fuck you cigarettes very much!

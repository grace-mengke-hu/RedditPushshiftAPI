Yesterday was day 1

Hi everyone, I am new to this. I set my quit date yesterday but failed. I did avoid smoking twice but failed on third attempt. 
I am ordering Allan Carr's Easy Way to Quit Smoking. 
I have some cigs to smoke and a ecig. After listening to 
a few online videos of him and celebrities, I think those alternatives will die. I am looking for support and know I have a problem. 
I would like to take it a day at a time for now.

Gonna try this again...

I was at a solid 4 months of not smoking, quit cold turkey, started working out. I was deployed, in a remote location, and it was so easy. Came home, went through a really brutal break up, and caved after two weeks of being home. It's been almost 4 months since I've been home. I'm gonna try this again. The support was integral to me committing to this and drinking is a trigger for me to light a cigarette, so I'm gonna try to stop drinking as well.

Any new/better pointers?

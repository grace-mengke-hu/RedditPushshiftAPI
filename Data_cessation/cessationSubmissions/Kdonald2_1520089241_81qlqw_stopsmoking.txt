Day 11-feeling foggy

I woke up on day 11 and felt really good.  I got some walking in and got ready for work as usual.  I went in feeling foggy and drained.  I thought i was getting sick because everyone seems to be coming down with a cold.  I went through the day like i had taken a sleep aid; i could hardly keep my eyes open!  By the end of the day, i realized that i hadn’t put in a nicotine patch that morning!  I powered through and went to bed early.  I slept almost ten hours last night!  I realize that i can do this.  I’m going to make it.  It’s really all in my head right now and I’m more powerful than the cigarettes.

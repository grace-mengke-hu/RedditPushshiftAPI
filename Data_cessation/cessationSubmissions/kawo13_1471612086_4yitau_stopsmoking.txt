why I quit

my dad got lung cancer. had tubes going inside and outside his body. they had to cut open him from the back to remove a piece of lung. he was lucky, they found it early, he survived. is something like that really necessary?! why would you do something like that not only to yourself but to everyone that knows and loves you? don't smoke ever again! it only brings unhappiniess in your own life and into the life of others around you.

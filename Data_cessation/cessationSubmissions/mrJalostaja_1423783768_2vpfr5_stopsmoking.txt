What have you learned through trial and error?

Successful and not yet successful quitters, what mistakes have you made that other people can learn from? What else have you tried, which strategies have worked for you?

I'll throw some of mine in:

* Always keeping a pack of cigarettes with you even after you quit makes you immune to the temptation of someone offering you a smoke. Generally, if you can carry smokes and not smoke them, you're winning.
* If you don't like the flavor of the nicotine gum you bought, try another one. It's a lot easier to turn chewing into a habit if it tastes good. I've tried nicotine gum a couple of times, and the flavor is a huge factor in determining the success rate.
* Don't make your relatives responsible for not giving you smokes if you ask. If you really have to, then tell them to make you wait for 5 minutes until giving it to you.
* If you have a craving, go take a deep sniff of the ashtray. 
* The biggest cravings come with the actions that you've used to follow with smoking. For me they are stuff like waking up, eating, waiting for and getting off a bus. Find these routines and prepare for the cravings. Make sure you have something to do and remind yourself of the fact that you don't want to smoke because it's satisfying, but instead it's because you've conditioned yourself over the years with nicotine. Find a replacement, like regular chewing gum or a toothpick.
* Don't try to quit before you've got actual motivation. Cigarettes seem godly when you're not smoking, and resisting that is difficult without motivation

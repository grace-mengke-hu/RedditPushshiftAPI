I need to quit while I'm ahead, so today's the day. Boom.

Been smoking since 19, I'm 21 now. I stopped buying packs after I got up to about 1/week in my first year. 

Now I just take drags and occasionally bum from friends at parties or bars... But I'm a runner and a biker and I never want to give those things up.

So wish me luck, I'll be around.

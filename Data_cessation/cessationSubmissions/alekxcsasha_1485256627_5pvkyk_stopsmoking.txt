Tomorrow is the day

I have been smoking for 10 years now, tried to stop once but I failed after 5 months. I decided to try to quit once more, mostly because I fear for my health. Now, I mostly fear that I am going to miss something very important in my life when I quit, not physicaly. For example, I fear that my afternoon break, when I drink coffee and smoke two ciggaretres, is going to loose its importance, and that I wont have anything like that anymore, to relax. Also in the morning, I feel that I cant go on with the day if I dont drink my coffe and smoked at least two. There is also the thing when I go out in a bar, I am ussually shy, and when I dont have anything to talk about I just smoke one, and it feels like a shield, like I dont have to to contribute to the conversation thats going on. Has anyone had the same issues when trying to quit? If yes, how did you overcome them?

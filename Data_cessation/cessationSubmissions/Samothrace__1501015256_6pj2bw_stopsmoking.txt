14 hours and I don't feel like I can go any longer today.

I've gotten through most of the day at work with the patch, and lots of internal struggles, but now I'm sitting in a meeting as I type this, feeling like I'm going to have a breakdown any second.  All I keep thinking about is going to the store and buying a pack the second this meeting is over.  I should have waited until the weekend to do this.  I don't care about my reasons for quitting right now,  but I know I will 30 seconds after smoking a cigarette.  Fuck, this is hard.

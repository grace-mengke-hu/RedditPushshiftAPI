"Join me in not smoking today" - this phrase or its are getting so annoying. Everytime I read it, I think I'm in some cult.

If you want to make words meaningless - overuse them.

Anyway - let's be happy we're not smokers anymore. Because I certainly am!:) And for all of you, who want to quit.


* Read Allen Carrs book

* Take yourself as much time as you need

* Add something to your quitting. Another healthy or interesting habit - something you enjoy

* Welcome in the normal world.



**Edit:** I fucked up the title. It meant "this phrase or its variations".

I need some support with quitting smoking.

I feel like I'm trapped guys. I've only been smoking for about a year and a half now but it has it's grip on me. I didn't have asthma before and I think the smoking brought it light. The doctors tell me its a mild case but the longer I smoke the more I've needed my inhaler. All my friends smokes, mostly hookah but some do smoke cigs. I feel like crap all the time plus I live in a old, dusty, musty house that only makes things worse. To give you guys a little back story because I feel like it would help, my Grandfather smoked for 40+ years and that's what killed him. I look up to my Grandpa so much even though he has passed. My Father dipped for 20+ years but quit so I know it is possible to stop. I guess my question is would nicotine gum help? Most of the time when I wanna smoke is at work because a lot of people smoke at my job. I know it's going to be hard but I can feel myself slowing getting worse every day and I feel like I've lost... please give me some input, I need words of encouragement!

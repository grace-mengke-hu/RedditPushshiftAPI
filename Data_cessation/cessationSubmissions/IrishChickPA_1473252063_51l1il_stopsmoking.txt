5 days until Quit Day

Hello,

I've been doing reading and research but I'm looking for suggestions from people who have actually quit on how to deal with cravings triggered by stress. I know my brain is lying to me when it says I need a cup of coffee and a cigarette to deal with a very stressful moment, but I'm trying to figure out what else I can do that will actually work. I don't want to just go around and be snippy with coworkers, or go into the house and be snippy with my kids, just because I'm having cravings. In the past when I trying to quit I suddenly become snippy even though that's not my normal self.  And then I go smoke.

Any suggestions for those of you who have dealt with this successfully, without turning in to someone you're not and being mean to the people around you?

Thanks for any help!

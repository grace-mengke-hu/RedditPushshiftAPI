Today is the day

Today I quit smoking! I knew this was a bad idea since i started but I couldn't stop myself and before I realised I was already addicted... Moreover, I am only 16 and this will not end up well if I continue. I realised that this is only a mentall addiction and only harms me. I have been smoking for, forunately, only a year and this is the day I stop! It will be hard as here in Bulgaria you can buy cigarettes at almost every shop(I can't blame them though as everybody is looking for extra income in such a poor country) and also some of my friends smoke but I just won't let a cigarette come to my hand.

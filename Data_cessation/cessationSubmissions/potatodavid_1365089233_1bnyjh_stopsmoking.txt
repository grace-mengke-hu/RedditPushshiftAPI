Day 1 sorta

I've actually quit almost a month ago. I was a pack a day until March 18th, I didn't really feel I could post here until I officially  quit for good. I had 4 cigs one night drinking with friends. The next day I woke up  like someone shit in my mouth.   I started using lozenges, and have had have had virtually no cravings apart from when I go drinking. So now it's been 2 weeks since the 4 smiggy night. I will call this day 1.

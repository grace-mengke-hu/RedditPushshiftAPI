Quit for 4 months

And I'm suffering from pain, almost like a burning sensation like their inflamed. Is it a case that they will get worse before they get better? I'm very fearful of how much permanent lung damage I have done. I have probably smoked for 10 years 3 cigarettes a day.
I'm going to the doctors next Tuesday but if anyone has any experience with this please shed some light on a worried fella. I'm scared of having diseases like emphysema and not being able to undo all this damage.

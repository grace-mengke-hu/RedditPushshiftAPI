how long before i feel better?

Ive heard that smoking can give you a nasty cough (badness leaving you) but since i quit, Ive had laryngitis, tonsilitis my asthma came back and i now have a nasty chest infection, ive been so sick that my doctor now says theres no point of me having more antibiotics, so ive started natural remedies- ive been inhaling steamed Friars Balsalm.

The giving up smoking part as a result has been a lot easier ironically! 
So have any of you have such a long bout of illness?

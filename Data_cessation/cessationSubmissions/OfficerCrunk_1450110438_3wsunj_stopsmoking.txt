Week 7 smoke free - insane amount of random cravings?

I work at a business where fucking everyone around me smokes and although I've been  completely cigarette free for 7 weeks now I just randomly started getting these nasty cravings to make love to a cigarette.   

it's insane considering I've done incredibly well these past 7 weeks.  Like literally all day at work I just can't get over not being able to smoke until I'm at home and can completely control my surroundings.   

Useless post I know but I'd rather write a bunch of stupid shit instead of going and having a smoke....

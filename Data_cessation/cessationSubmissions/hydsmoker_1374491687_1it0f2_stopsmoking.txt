Somewhere around my 7th attempt. Going cold turkey. Need motivation

Today is day 1 of what is probably my 7th (or 8th or 9th.. I am not sure any more) attempt to quit smoking. This time however, I am feeling a bit more confident than usual and hoping this one goes better than others. It's not even 24 hours yet, but unlike other times, I am not craving for a smoke at all.

My strategy is simple.. every time I feel like smoking, I just tell myself, "If you don't quit now.. you never will". Will keep you updated, reddit.

PS: A deeply heartfelt thanks to the guys who started this subreddit and all of those who keep it alive. You guys are awesome!!

Stinky smokers!

In my college library at the moment and someone sitting near me has just had a cigarette - the stink!! That smell is so rotten I can't believe I used to willingly do that to myself and that this is how I used to smell to other people. I think the smell off a smoker is actually worse than the smell of cigarette smoke itself. All I smell of now is that lovely Lush body lotion I put on this morning. Here's to going through the whole day smelling like roses, peeps!

Chesty cough a few days after stopping normal?

Hi there.

Smoked from 15-18 daily. Heavily for 1.5 years.

Stopped at 18 and slowly started again at 21. Smoked joints mixed with tobacco semi-regularly at 19+20. Never smoked cigarettes daily again but it was starting to get that way.

Stopped a few days ago and felt great but a chesty cough has started. Is a delayed clearing of the lungs normal?

When will I feel fresh lungs again?
Cheers

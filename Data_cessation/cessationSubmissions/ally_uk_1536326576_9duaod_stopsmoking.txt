Nearly a Month with No Nicotine checking in

Hi guys I quit vaping about a month ago just stopped cold turkey. 

I have no desire to smoke however some things are bothering me.

1) Overeating some days I cannot stop eating everything in sight I have gained weight.
2) A strong desire to get fit but no motivation I keep putting it off.
3) Brain Fog / Apathy I get days where everything is meh I can't seem to focus on anything or absorb information I am easily distracted.
4) Because of the brain fog feeling and weight gain I think I am beginning to suffer from depression.

Someone please help me I feel so low and unmotivated.

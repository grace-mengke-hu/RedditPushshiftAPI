Was a full year free from nicotine and i had a ecig relapse.

Since a week ago, i fixed my vaporizer and i tried to stay with no nicotine juices, today i was vaping a lil bit( i mostly do it at night) and i suddenly saw a juice that i bought long ago and it had a few drops in it, so i just putted it on my vaporizer thinking that it had no nic on it( forreal thinking it, then i started vaping and i felt the fucking effect like on my 5 vape, i just liked the taste of it but it stated (3mg of nicotine) i fucking pannick, im still kinda on shock, i felt the effect of it, i think i was planning it but i truly thought that it had 0 nicotine. I felt the effect like 5 seconds and i really felt bad about myself. I now feel anxiety and like no sleeping. I now think that i should do something about it i dont want to fully fuck myself up or relapse entirely. Any advice?

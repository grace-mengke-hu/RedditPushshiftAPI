WHO AM I ?

You said it all.I can't believe how out of character I am.I started cold turkey,but had to go to the patch-I walk around in a fog and feel so uncomfortable,sad & lost. 6 weeks and can't smell or taste food normally.I am sleeping but have to say I cannot believe how horrible it is to stop smoking and what I have gone thru..good luck to all!

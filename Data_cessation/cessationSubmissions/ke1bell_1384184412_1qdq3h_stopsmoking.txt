Last smoke was Friday-the weekends are easy-its work that's the killer!

So, I started smoking again.  When i was waiting for my bus on Friday afternoon to take me home, I realized I was out of smokes.  First thought-do i have time to run to the store to get more before my bus?  Second thought-Do i really wanna keep doing this to myself?  

My boyfriend doesn't smoke anymore and hasn't for over a year.  I pick it up, drop it, pick it up, drop it.  He doesn't deserve to have to kill my ashtray mouth.  I smoke much less on weekends/at night simply because of the shame i feel walking out to sit outside by myself and smoke, and walk in KNOWING i reek and running to brush my teeth and put some sort of spray crap on so it won't be so bad.  That's a lot of work when you're paying for the privilege.

Well, i haven't smoked since.  All weekend, whenever i wanted to smoke, I would 420-leading to me feeling like I have a full term food baby right now, but at the same time....I can deal w/ waddling a bit right now.  I can deal w/ the bit of short term constipation, the runny nose, the disappearance of my patience....if it means I can get over this hump and really truly make my smoking a thing of the past.

I'm happy that I didn't buckle on the walk from my bus to work.  That's always the worst and weakest moment of my day.  But, I'm armed with citric cough drops and the resolve that I will be able to enjoy my holiday season without being preoccupied as to when I can sneak out for some delicious cancer. 

I am ready this time.  2 days in, and I'm not looking back!

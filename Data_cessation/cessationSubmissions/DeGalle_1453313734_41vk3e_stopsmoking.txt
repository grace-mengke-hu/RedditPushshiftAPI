Stopped smokin 14 days ago but my asthma has got very bad. Help.

As title says. 

Does anyone have similar experience? Coughing a lot and finding myself out of breath. Haven't had an attack for years and so this is a real shock to me.

Been doing some research on Google and a lot of people have similar experiences that last for years. I am actually quite frightened. I know why it is happening (cilia in lungs irritating me etc) but I have found very few people on line who experienced this and have reported that they felt better after x time. Can anyone share similar experiences? Thanks. Tempted to start smoking again, at least I felt better and was active.

Thanks guys.

Almost 7 months quit. Losing hope that cravings will ever go away.

I don't have cravings every single day anymore, but it’s close to that. Pretty tired of fighting them off :(

I’ll most likely stay quit, and I apologize if this is discouraging, but these realities are important to comprehend. Nicotine is a powerful as fuck.

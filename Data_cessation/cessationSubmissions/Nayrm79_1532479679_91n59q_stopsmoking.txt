35 days feels great!

First this subreddit is amazing, I love when people come together to help other and inspire other to do great things, I'll be 39 in a few months. After losing uncle a few weeks ago (he was a heavy smoker and drinker for 40+ years, you know where that leads). I decided that was enough, my writing on the wall so to speak. However my goal was smoke free by 40, started when I was 19 and several failed attempts later. I've done it, yes I'm 30ish days in. But this time feels different. I feel mentally stronger. 30 days and I don't miss them. But need help, my wife is still smoking and it hurts me. To watch the woman I love slowly kill herself. I don't want to be that nagging ex-smoker. Well all quit when we're ready. And helpful tips? Well all have to die at some point, but why die a slave to cigarettes. Thanks!

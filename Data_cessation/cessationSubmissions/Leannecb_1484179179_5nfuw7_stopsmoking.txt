Finding ways to be a nonsmoker

I go to my room to be by myself when I am cranky and I'm finding this very helpful. I called in sick for today and tomorrow so I can get a bit stronger before having to deal with unpleasant people at work. Taking deep breaths often BUT I AM NICOTINE FREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

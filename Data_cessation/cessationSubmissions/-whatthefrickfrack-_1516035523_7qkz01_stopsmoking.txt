Just found this Sub

from a link in AskReddit. I am currently trying to quit smoking. I used the patches for about 8 days. Once I switched to the smaller patches, I backslid. Both my boyfriend and my brother who live with me smoke. I am going to try again in 2 weeks. Do any of you have any advice for living with smokers while trying to quit? My boyfriend is quitting slowly by weaning himself off.

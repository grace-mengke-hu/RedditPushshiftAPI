I quit smoking on Tuesday and then I was thrown the ultimate test of will all week. TL;DR of the past 5 days.

Preface 31/F/Austin, TX. Very healthy eater and hard core worker outer... with 1 dirty nasty secret.

Monday: Wasn’t terrible. Had 10 cigs that day and decided randomly I was done when this pack was done; found out my “Work Grandma” had a stroke and cried like a bitch.


Tuesday: Got in a fight with a Russian at 3 am (phone not physically). Went to the doctor and got a script for Wellbutrin: Russians are awesome and so are drugs.


Wednesday: Was ran off the road on I35N on my way to Dallas, almost died; fuck you fucking gold mercedes, you didn’t even look.


Thursday: Got trapped in a Walgreens bathroom with a crazy man and had to pull my concealed carry weapon (S&W 9mm Shield) Yes I have a license to CC. Check out /r/EDC; scariest moment so far this year. When you can't flight be ready to fight ladies. I took my shoes off incase it came to hand to hand combat and I didn't want to get blood on my Michael Kors tweed 4" heels.


Friday: Wellbutrin is built up in my system, finally, there is no longer a pounding in my brain screaming for nicotine; Never turned into to a giant bitch. At least I don't think so.


If I made it through this week I can make it through anything. I had many opportunities to give, especially after Walgreens bathroom incident, it was staring me in the face, my beloved American Spirit-Yellows. I subscribed to this sub months ago and was really jealous of all your badges, I really wanted to earn my own. There should be a badge for "Very stressful day/week/month whatever. 


I earned this 4 day badge so hard and I am so proud of myself as a 15 year smoker.

Love you guys for the everyday reminder that it can be done; just took me a little longer to be there. 


Edit: Grammar: 

Two "ands" in one sentence.

Clarification and better explanation.

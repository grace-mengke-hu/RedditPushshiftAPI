I don’t have cravings... yet I want to smoke?

Hey guys! So I’m on day 4 of my quit and honestly, it’s been pretty cruisy. In the past I’ve done cold turkey but this time, I acknowledged that I needed a little help. So I decided to try patches. So far, I’m beyond impressed with how much they’ve helped. I’ve had maybe only 1-2 cravings over the past 4 days and they weren’t severe whatsoever. I’ve had a couple of low moods but completely manageable. Nothing like what I’ve experienced in the past. All in all this quit has been... a pleasant and positive experience so far. 
The problem is... I want to have a smoke. I don’t even know why because I’m not craving them, I just want to go outside and have one. I realise smoking was a big part of my routine before and it’s the habit that I miss rather than the act itself but I can’t help but think life is ‘missing’ something because I’m not going out for my smoke breaks anymore. Has anyone else felt like this?

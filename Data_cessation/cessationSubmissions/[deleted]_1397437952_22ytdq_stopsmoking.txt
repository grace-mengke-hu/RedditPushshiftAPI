Withdrawal symptoms or something else?

I quit smoking 3 months ago and I've had some wicked withdrawal that was unexpected. Headaches, night sweats, shaking, weight gain, and thoughts of murder (Just kidding). Most of those symptoms went away except for two things.

Case 1.

I originally quit to save money and my lungs because I couldn't breathe well at night.  I noticed a significant increase in my ability to breathe after the first month BUT that's because I wake up nearly every night soaked in sweat regardless of temperature. This occurred the first week I quit and it's still happening. Not sure if this is normal or it's because my blood circulation has improved.

Case 2.

I've gained 20lbs in two months and I haven't changed diet or eating habits. What the fuck!!! Actually I could use the weight gain but I wanted to know if 20lbs in two months is too much for someone who quit smoking. I've also considered the weight gain to be a contributing factor to my night sweats. Do you think it is because I have too much lover blubber?

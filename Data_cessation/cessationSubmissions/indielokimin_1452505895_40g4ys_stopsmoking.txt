Chest pains after quitting?

I'm going into my 23rd day of quitting smoking and I've been getting these chest pains since day 1. I have acid reflux disease so I'm used to getting minor chest pains from time to time, but lately some of them have been slightly alarming to the point where I thought I was experiencing a heart attack. They come at random too, so I always find myself on edge. Is this normal? Are any of you getting these chest pains too? I've read that they're a sign that your lungs are repairing themselves. If that's the case then I'm more than willing to ride them out. 

P.S. I also laid off smoking weed at the same time I did for cigs. Would that also explain the chest pains?

Getting rid of the crutch. A good secret birthday present!

I used to smoke almost a pack a day and quit that habit about 8 months ago. But, I have been super easy on myself about bumming them from other people. Not everyday and usually not more than 1 when I did.... But it is a huge crutch, knowing I could have one if I wanted. 

My boyfriend doesn't know I have the occasional smoke and that makes me feel more guilty about it... He told me he was so proud of me. So today, which is his birthday, I quit for real. No more crutch!! 

I'm about 22 hours in now and wanted to post this for accountability! Thanks! 
What's funny is, I've gone 22 hours plenty of times before... it just seems harder this time because I know there won't be a slip up.

Resetting the clock.

I caved in and bummed a cigarette from a coworker. My addiction to nicotine is frightening - two hours without a cigarette, and I find that my mind cannot focus on anything other than lighting up.

I am so disappointed in myself. When I took the first drag, I could feel the effects of the cigarette right away, and I instantly knew I did myself a disservice. This might be the hardest thing I'll ever have to push myself through. :(

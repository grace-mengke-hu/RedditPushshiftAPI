Only 6 days in but going strong...

So I'm 38, been smoking since I was 25.

I was on 25-30 smokes a day...well recently my mother had an operation to remove part of her stomach (she's morbidly obese) and part of that surgery was to quit smoking.

Well she reminded me that years ago she made me promise that when she quit I would too.

Previously I had been to the dr to get champix but they said it would be too much of a system shock and I needed to reduce myself to 10 a day before they gave it to me.  I told them if I did that I could quit myself and stormed out.

Turns out my mum had about 6 weeks of champix left, she gave it to me and within the first week I had reduced myself to 15 a day.  At the end of the second week of taking champix I went from 15 to 0.

The hardest part has been my routine and my young children driving me to despair...but each time a craving has hit I've maintained my resolved.  Mainly to prove people wrong about my ability.

Just as an aside, 5 years ago I gave up weed and 6 years ago I gave up alcohol...my partner and friends ask me out and tell me it's just one but with my families history and my personal experience...abstinence is the best policy. 

I an however curious, at which point should I stop taking champix? (I'm thinking 3 weeks as that's when withdrawals are meant to stop)

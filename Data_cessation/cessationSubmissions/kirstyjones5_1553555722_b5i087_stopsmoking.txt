18f, how do I stop accepting cigarettes from people

I started smoking recently out of curiosity. 2018 was the year I was going to do everything I’ve always wanted to, and try ‘everything’ at least once. Now that college stuff is done I can finally relax somewhat, and this whole year’s been just one long break from responsibility.

I grew up around a lot of people who did a lot of stuff and by the time I was in 8th grade, almost everyone I knew was a smoker/stoner/alcoholic, but I never fell to the peer pressure to smoke, simply because it never interested me. 

But this year, I decided to try it out after spending some time around this one group of other seniors I had a falling out at one of their friend’s frat parties. It’s disgusting and I hate it, but I felt the need not to waste the pack so I kept doing it. Before I knew it I was going through half a pack a day, then I stopped for a while. However, I alternated between inhaling and keeping it in my mouth, and the majority of the time it was in my mouth. 

I know secondhand smoke is still bad, but after half a year what are my chances of getting cancer if I quit now and never take it up again? Will my throat ever heal completely? I’ve just had the realization that I’m not worthless and I have goals now, I want to be healthy. I’ve been eating a ton of peppers and drinking lots of water after cleanup but it seems like it’s all in vain.

Btw, it’s really easy for me to quit cold turkey, but when presented with the opportunity to smoke I almost always take it up just because.  

TL;DR: How do I stop accepting cigarettes from people, and what’s the probability of me getting cancer if I quit cold-turkey now?

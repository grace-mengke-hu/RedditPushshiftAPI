Regarding Allen Carr's Easyway

I've read it before and now I'm reading it again. I recently failed another quit. What I wanted to ask/say was that I know I can push through, I know I can do it and it was A LOT easier after 3 days except for certain times- those times when my depression and emotions kick in and I lose my faith in myself and in everything. But for all those going cold turkey as I did, I wanted to mention that for the first 2 or 3 days I cried constantly, bawled even, and felt physically HORRIBLE. I came down with a fever, had to sleep a lot, etc. I'm saying this because from what I remember after reading Easyway we should expect none of that. I found this to be untrue. My mind was in the right place "Yes! I'm free! This is a reason to celebrate!" But physical withdrawal I believe is a real thing and someone had commented on here that "if you haven't given yourself at least a week you haven't even tried" because that's the hardest part. That helped me, or rather will help in the future. Off to read my book now. Just wanted to share- IMO if you're experiencing these things it's normal. Anyone NOT have the withdrawals?

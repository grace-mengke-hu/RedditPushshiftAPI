Quitting with a significant other

A little over a year ago, I told my husband I wanted to quit smoking but that I didn't think I could do it unless he did too. We set a quit date. He ended up quitting 2 days before me-- he was already in the mindset and didn't want to buy another pack.

He expressed some resentment that I "made him quit" or that "he didn't even want to quit," especially at the beginning. Now I think that he is happy to be a former smoker, but I don't think that nagging thought that his wife made him do something he wasn't ready to do on his own ever completely went away and I am worried that his perception of me changed despite my efforts to show my gratitude for his support.

He hasn't mentioned my "making him quit" in a long time, but it still scares me that he definitely felt and might still feel that way.

Did any of you quit because of someone else's influence? Did nicotine withdrawal make you resent them, and if so did it ever fully go away?

For those of you trying to quit, I'll include the motto that helped me the most and that I often comment on this sub-- "Remember that this is a temporary journey to a lifetime of freedom."

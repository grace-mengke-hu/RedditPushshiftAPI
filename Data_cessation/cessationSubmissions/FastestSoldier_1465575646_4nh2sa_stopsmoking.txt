Two weeks completed

This has been the easiest quit so far. I can drive, work, play games, watch movies without the urge of using tobacco while doing these activities. The hardest trigger I will hopefully overcome tonight. Drinking. Wish me luck!

This is a summary of my quitting process. 

>The first three days 

Fucking horrible as usual. Thinking about tobacco 24/7. Those three minute urges the scientists talk about don't apply to me. I have craving that lasts for hours. 

>The rest of the first week

Going ok. But depressed, sad and empty feeling. The worst cravings are over and now they only last for a short amount of time. 

>Second week

Incredibly easy. Almost no urges at all. I'm also starting to feel happy and relaxed without my tobacco. The only thing I struggle with is sleep. I can't sleep when I go to bed and I wake up incredibly early. The other night I couldn't sleep before 1:30 am and I woke up at 5:30 am unable to sleep again. The other nights are also similar to this and I usually wake up several times a night. I'm starting to feel like the guy in "the machinist".

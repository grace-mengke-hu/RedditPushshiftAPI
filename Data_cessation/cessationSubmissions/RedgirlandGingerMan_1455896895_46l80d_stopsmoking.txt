1 year!

So it's been a year and I'm so happy! Yesterday I ran for 10 minutes straight on the treadmill without stopping for the first time in my life, I was barely even out of breath! I love being a non smoker!! I've also gained more friends, got a much better social life and I don't smell like an old ashtray anymore! Yay!!

Do smokers go through phases?

I do not smoke.

My one friend says he goes through phases. He would smoke for a while, then stop. He would pick it up every now and then.

Currently he has stopped and just decided to not ever do it again. He hasn't been smoking for months. He says he was never addicted. He says he is better off not smoking right now.

Does that make any sense? Can a guy just smoke whenever and not actually be addicted? Stop for a while and then pick it up again?

It shocked me how he was able to just stop smoking so easily. This guy even was using chewing tobacco. He just stopped smoking all of a sudden. 

Will he eventually go back to it or something? He says he is pretty much done with it and wants to be healthy.

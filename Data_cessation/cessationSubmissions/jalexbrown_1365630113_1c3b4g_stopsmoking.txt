At Only 17.5 Hours, I Relapsed of My Own Accord

I contemplated lying and pretending it never happened, but that wouldn't be fair to the people that worked really hard to keep their badges; as such, I've already - less than 24 hours later - had my badge removed.  I'm sad, because it wasn't some irresistible force that made it happen; it was a very casual, boredom-based craving that I lacked the self-discipline to deny.  I'm as disappointed in myself as I'm sure most of you will be, but I hope to be back and try again after I've worked on conquering some of my self-discipline issues.  To anyone that said kind and supportive words in my short time here, I'm sorry that they were wasted on me.  Good luck everyone!

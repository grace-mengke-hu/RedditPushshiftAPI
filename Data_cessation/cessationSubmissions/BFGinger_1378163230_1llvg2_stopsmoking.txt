Had an Asthma Attack without even having Asthma, Really shook me

So let's keep this one short, I'm only 17 (I know people are a lot older) been smoking since I was 15, on Friday night, after regular chest pains, short breathness and constant coughing, I was submitted to A&E, where I discovered that I was asthmatic, anybody ever had anything that has shook them quite badly, that has make them just quit, I never wanted to stop smoking, but I'm trying, one thing I need help on is this constant thinking of where I was planning to have a cigarette in the future (Festivals, Parties, Gigs) and that has what has got me hooked, but I'm now 36 hours clean, but that's because of my e cig, which I plan to put down, any opinions and ideas on how to help?

Maybe not short, but any help would be amazing :)

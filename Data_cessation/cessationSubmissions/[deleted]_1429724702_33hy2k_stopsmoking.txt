How to deal/help a quitting smoker.

My boyfriend is quitting. I am 21, he is 35 and has been smoking since he was 15. He hates the fact that he smokes but enjoys smoking as his career is stressful and lots of his friends smoke. He has quit a bunch of times in relationships and started again once they ended for different reasons. Now he has quit again and is on day four or five of the patch. When we first started hanging out and before we dated he mentioned wanting to quit. When we first started dating he said I made it easier for him to smoke less b/c I didn't smoke and finally set a quit date.


Anyways, over the week he is getting more and more moody and irritable. He has no sex drive. One minute he's in a good mood, the next minute he's being all ...weird. Like if I ask him a question he'll start getting all weird and asking why I'm asking that and just being testy.



I am here for him. I am and I'm holding it together. But I have depression which I have been dealing with for many years now. I tend to pick up on other people's sour moods and it's hard for me. I feel a little tearful just being around him. Like I know when he snaps at me or whatever it isn't personal it's just the dark mood is kind of contagious. I can manage it but it's no fun. I know it's only temporary and I just want to be here for him. 



He's not seeing a doctor to help him quit and I don't think he wants to. I don't know if I should recommend that he does? I am wondering if he needs some antidepressants or something to help him out. 



Any advice on what I or he should do or should not do? Please don't recommend that Allan Carr book, he's not really interested and I'm sick of hearing about it lol. Mainly I want to know what the best method is me to be here for him without a hit on my own mood.

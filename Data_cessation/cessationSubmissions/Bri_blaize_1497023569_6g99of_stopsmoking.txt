Day 6 Exercise - Write Down the Five Best Things I've Experienced Since Quitting

Pretty interesting exercise that I'm having difficulty answering.  It would be a lot easier had they said the "5 Worst".
- Yesterday I hit the not having 100 cigs milestone, which was uplifting.  Admittedly, I might be embracing these milestones a bit too much, however after trying so many times to quit, I finally realize how much power the cig had over me and I that each milestone is significant.
- Joining this community.  Didn't have any expectations but after receiving some positive feedback/tips...I think this site might be a blessing.
- Fingernail on left index finger has a solid straight line slightly past my cuticle. The majority of the nail is stained yellow from smoking but one small section is clear.  It's like I have detoxing gage right there on my hand...who knew?

I know the exercise stated five, but I hate writing stuff for the sake of writing.  I will remember these things most when reflecting back.

Thanks for allowing me to share and good luck in your personal fight.

Smoking screwed up my lungs and my throat

Now I'm not a chronic tobacco smoker but I am a chronic marijuana smoker. But for the last few days I was on a trip with my friends and one of my buddies he made a pact to smoke cigarettes throughout the trip and so we ended up smoking around 30-40 cigarettes per person for the whole trip I think. After a point all of us lost count . Well I don't really enjoy smoking tobacco but I was making do with it as I was out of weed. Long story short, right now I'm having a very bad cough, my throat seems fucked and so do my lungs. I think I screwed up my throat and lungs. I haven't smoked anything for a day so far. But this cough isn't going away and is getting worse. What to do?

Just had a son...want to quit

Hey everyone ! So my son is 2 months old. I'm at the point where I don't really enjoy smoking unless I'm drinking...then I love it lol. But....I'm continuing to smoke. I worked a night shift last night and smoked. I'm home now and haven't bought a pack....here's to hoping....

Just hit the 7 days mark after going cold turkey...

Used to smoke 40 cigs every day on average, but I gotta admit the quitting is going really well. Some concentration problems, three or four major cravings per day and some weird nightmares, but I feel so much better and quitting is so much easier than I feared it would be :-)

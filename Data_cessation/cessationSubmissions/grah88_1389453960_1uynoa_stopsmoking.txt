Let me tell you my "I Quit" story.

So there I was a happy and healthy smoker. Then on that same day I was on a little run about 3 miles in my back started hurting no biggy. The next day it was worse decide to go see a doctor. Doc takes my blood pressure I was running on more compression than a diesel engine. He said fuck my back lets check out my heart. Looks me dead in the eyes and said you need to quit smoking. Since that day I  stopped my 2 pack a day habit. 

Pro-Tip. The E-cig is just a cop out. I did it and it only slowed me down.

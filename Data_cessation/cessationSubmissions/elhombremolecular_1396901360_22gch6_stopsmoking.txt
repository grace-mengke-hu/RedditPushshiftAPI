It's been a week...still no cough?

Greetings ex-smokers. I quit once a few years ago, got a pretty bad cough, lost my voice, recovered, and then all was well. 

I have been off cigs for a week now, and I haven't started coughing at all. I do use e-cigs, and I wonder if this may play a role in delaying a cough, I don't know why it would, though. 

Other factors: I was a fairly light smoker, a pack every 2/3 days at my heaviest. I regularly exercised while smoking, and I read somewhere on the interwebs that this may actually help keep the lung cilia "upright", atleast a bit more so when compared to a sedentary smoker. Anyway, I don't think I've escaped the post-smoke cough, I'm just confused as to why it hasn't hit yet. 

Anyone else experienced a delayed cough or the absence of one? I played in a hockey game yesterday, (quit for 6 days at the time), definitely felt better, but not back to my smoke-free self yet.

Day 2 - Check in

Checking in and checking up on my July 1st stopsmoking cohort.  Made it past Day 1 guys...how about you?

This time seems different.  I have my head in the right place I think.  Before, it was "I know I need to quit" and this time it's "I WANT to quit". I downloaded a couple of apps, the Smoke Free and Livestrong ones for some accountability tools and I'm planning on coming here daily for additional support.  

Yesterday I chewed gum all day and drank like 2 gallons of water.  I'm definitely hydrated now!  Every time I had a craving (which was at least 20-30 times), I would take a couple of deep breaths to use as a reminder of why I am quitting and also as a habit replacement.  Substituting clean air for tar filled air.  I'm a big believer in the [Power of Habit](http://www.amazon.com/The-Power-Habit-What-Business-ebook/dp/B0055PGUYU) and making a different habit pattern outside of just "don't smoke" I believe is important.  And I don't want to substitute food obviously. 

Here's to a successful Day 2!

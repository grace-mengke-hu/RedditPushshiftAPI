Recently bought a vape... So far, so good.

So I recently bought a vape in the hopes that I would be able to substitute smoking for vaping. Maybe not the smartest way to quit smoking but so far it's working. 

Up until I bought the vape, I would normally smoke about 10-12 cigarettes a a day...sometimes more. I have become increasingly embarrassed about smoking cigs, the smell, the deviant habit, everything. After buying the vape though, I have drastically cut back on my cigarette smoking. Yesterday I only smoked 3! Today I am on track for 3 also!

Am I wrong to think that this is a big victory for me? I'm pretty happy about it. 

 I know that I am still taking in nicotine but I feel like it's much better to pick up the vape and take a couple puffs than to light up a cigarette. 

I am hoping that I can just switch to vaping and then cut that off. I'm sure its not that healthy to replace smoking with vaping but it HAS to be better than smoking 12 cigarettes a day. 

I really, really want to stop smoking cigarettes for good. Is this an appropriate way to go about it?

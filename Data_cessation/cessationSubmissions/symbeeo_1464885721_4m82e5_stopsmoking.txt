Yesterday I became a non-smoker - Yay!

I have been smoking since 1969. It was summertime, I was hanging out with the neighborhood bunch and there were a couple "new cool kids" in the mix. A cigarette started going around, and I took a puff. I had never tasted anything so vile in my life! Can't believe I continued for the next 47 years. Can't believe I'm still upright (as in vertical). 
June 01 at 10:15 PDT I smoked my last cigarette - and today has been okay. I smell better.

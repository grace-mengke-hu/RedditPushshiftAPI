Want to nip it in the bud.

For the last couple of years, beginning around the time I started college (British college, equivalent of American High School) i've smoked from time to time, what i'd call 'social smoking' -- only when i'm out and with other people.

However, over the last month or two, starting with my final A-levels exam season, I started smoking on my own to help cope with stress. It's now got to the point where i'm smoking daily - albeit one at most, and most of the time i'll stop halfway through a rollie. It's mainly for the nicotine rush, as it feels like it's the only respite I get from the constant revision that's been going on for the exams. This will probably sound really pathetic, especially for people who have been chain smoking for years. But i'm desperate not to have a long-term dependency. I've decided to quit smoking altogether starting on Friday (the day of my most important exam) but i've tried 'quitting' before (when it was at the point of smoking a couple times in a fortnight, at most!) and I go back to it for the nicotine rush.

I have a lot of sympathy for people who want to quit and who are used to smoking a lot more than me, so I feel incredibly weak for wanting to come for help at such an early stage. But like I said, i'm really desperate not to attain more than even the light addiction I have now. What can I do to stop, even with the exam stress?

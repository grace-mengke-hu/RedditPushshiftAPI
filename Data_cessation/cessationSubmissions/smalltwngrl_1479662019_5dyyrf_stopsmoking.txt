Relapse... feeling pretty guilty about it.

Yesterday was one month since my last cigarette until about 10pm last night. It was also my BIL birthday. We all went karaoking and drinking and I ended up having two cigarettes. I feel fine this morning no cravings as of yet. Has anyone else been able to quit but still have a couple when they drink? Can I still keep the clock rolling at a month and a day or did I ruin it?

Craving/anxiety that just won't go away

I've had a really terrible night at work, and I'm on my 15th day with no cigarettes with 14mg patches getting me through. I have a horrible, hair pulling craving and anxiety that has been persistent for over an hour. It just won't go away. I've been off work for 55 minutes and parked in my driveway with my head down. I don't dare go inside and see my boyfriend like this. We live in a bachelor suite and there's no room I can lock myself into and be alone. I feel like if I go inside, I will probably lose control of myself. I feel like a loose cannon. I'm trying to ride the craving off... but, as I said, I've been sitting here for about an hour with no luck. What on earth do I do?

How to "believe you can do it?"

Hi all, first post but long term lurker.

My history with smoking goes back to about 6 years ago in university when I smoked around 10 a day for 2 years. I then successfully quit cold turkey using the Alan Carr book. Due to recent life changes and stress I started again and am now smoking about 15 a day. Its really frustrating for me as up to last year I was very fit an healthy, running half marathons etc, but life caught up with me and I badly wish I'd never started again. 

I re-read Alan's book again recently, more than once, but I keep getting stuck with the bit at the end that says "only proceed to quit if you have no doubt in your mind you will be succesful." I tried once last week anyway and only made it 24 hours. I just have no confidence that I will be able to do it and when I try to "be happy about being a non-smoker" instead I just imagine all the situations in which I will cave and give in. Has anyone experienced this and managed to get over it? 

Thank you in advance.

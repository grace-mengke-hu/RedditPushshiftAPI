Just found a pack...

...AND SQUASHED IT!!

I've been going on a 10 minute walk in lieu of my morning smoke break. During my walk this morning I saw a cigarette pack on the ground and picked it up assuming it was litter, only to realize that the pack was still half-full.  For a split second I considered what I would have to do to light one of those cancer sticks, but immediately squashed the pack and chucked it in the nearest garbage can.

24 days! Hope everyone else is winning their battle today.

Just started cold turkey!

Any advice to get me through? I have tried to quit before using vapes and gum but neither work, so I've decided to mind over matter it and force myself to quit for the sake of my health, my bank account, and my loved ones. The biggest issue is both my mother and co-workers smoke, so there is a lot of environmental pressure around since it's so easy just to say "I'll just cheat and bum one." Next thing I know, I cave and have bought another pack. I've downloaded the smoke-free app so I'm hoping that'll help! I've smoked for 4 years now and it's become such an everyday routine. Any words of wisdom helps! 

I'm excited to see how much better I'll start feeling and to become an active part of this community! I already know all you folks are awesome and for all those who have quit, or are trying to, keep up the good work!

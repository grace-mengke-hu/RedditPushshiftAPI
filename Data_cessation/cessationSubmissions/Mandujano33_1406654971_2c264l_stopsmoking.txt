when I wondered when quitting. my answer was when I turned 30. That day was yesterday. Today is my first day!

redditors friends, I have the full support of my girlfriend who is also quitting .. everyone tells me I can not, but I have the conviction that yesterday I smoked the last cigarette of my life .. any suggestions?.
Edit: Now the second day! was hell of a night.. I felt burning in my head .. but we will pass without incident. Now I feel stronger and I'm sure one day at a time and with the support of my girlfriend and you, we will get over it.

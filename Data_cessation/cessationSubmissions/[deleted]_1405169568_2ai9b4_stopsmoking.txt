How did I get here?

I grew up around smoke.  Several people in my family are smokers.  My grandmother smoked constantly from the time she was 13 until her late 60's/early 70's (she now has a myriad of smoking-related illnesses that she is struggling with).  My parents both are constant smokers.  Growing up in a smoking-house, I hated it.  I would go to school and people would ask me if I smoked because everything reeked of stale cigarette smoke.  I remember driving somewhere in the summer and having the AC on while they were smoking - it would burn my eyes and irritate me.   I tried a cigarette one time in High School - it left this weird residue on my tongue and made me gag.  I would occasionally smoke in college at the bars (when you could still smoke and drink inside!).  

Fast forward to my master's degree, and I guess in combination with the stress of that program and moving out of my comfort zone, I began to smoke.  The first time I smoked regularly for about a year.  Then when I couldn't take a full breath without sounding like I was wheezing, I dropped it.  I remember there being some mild discomfort the first few nights after quitting.  However, now, five years later, I have been smoking for three years fairly regularly.

I am actually getting ready to go back for my doctoral degree, and I want to give it up when I move - for good - August 1st.  I see the change of scenery and lifestyle as a good time/place to make a few changes.  

Any suggestions?  What should I look out for?  What should I expect?  Does this sound like a good idea?  Those of you who have been successful in your efforts to quit: what helped the most?

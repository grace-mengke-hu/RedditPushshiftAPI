Just make it past Day 3: How Day 4 changes everything

1. Day One : The Deciding Day 

Sometimes the hardest Day. Sometimes the easiest. This day depends on your attitude. For me I was determined so day one felt like a breeze. 

2.Day Two: The First Hard Day

You wake up. You think of a cigarette. Make Coffee think of a cigarette. You eat. You think of a cigarette. My day two was not in any way easy. Everything on day two will trigger you to smoke. You must resist and reaffirm that YOU want this for yourself. 

Day 3: The Hardest Day

Welcome to hell. Your reptilian brain wants nicotine. Your brain is ready to deceive you at all cost. You feel prepared and ready on day three. You have a goal on quitting and your mind is set. But don't fall for any sly brain tricks. Stress. Meals. Breaks. Triggers. You don't need that cigarette. I had my first drinks on day 3 and survived, including walking outside with a smoker as they lit one up. I fought hard and won. Battle Day 3 and win. 

Day 4: The Easiest Day Yet

No cravings upon waking up or breakfast.

No need for a cigarette during work.

It all clicked on Day 4. This is easy. Don't convince yourself its hard. Nicotine had a grasp on all of us but it gets better. Every cigarette you turn away from your brain you grow stonger. Happier. More independent. More Healthy.




Make it to Day 4 and I promise it'll change for the best.

Post Dinner cravings

So after several failed attempts to quit smoking here I am. This time i'm pretty sure I'm done smoking. 20 cigarettes or so a day for almost 6yrs is enough. I'm tired of smelling bad, being unhealthy & feeling broke at the end of every month because of cigarettes. I seem to be able to deal with all my cravings & moments when i'm usually smoking except for the one post dinner. That craving alone doesn't seem to go away until I fall asleep. It is driving me insane! I had a similar problem in my earlier attempts at quitting smoking as well. The one time I lasted a little short of a month it still wouldn't go away.

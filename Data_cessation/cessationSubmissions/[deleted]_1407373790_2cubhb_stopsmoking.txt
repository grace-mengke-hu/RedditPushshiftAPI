Should I reset?

Hey /r/nosmoking. I was with some friends this evening. We went for drinks. I had no physical craving to smoke but out of curiosity and psychological habit I arksed my friend for a smoke. He gave it to me and while they smoked I took drags on an unlit cigarette (which I gave back when we was finished). Does this count as smoking, and if thus, should I reset my badge? Safe, cityx

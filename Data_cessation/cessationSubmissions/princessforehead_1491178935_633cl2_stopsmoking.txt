Stopping smoking today

My boyfriend and I have decided to stop smoking, myself having been a heavy smoker for 4 (-ish) years and never really committing to trying to quit, and him, having been a heavy smoker for 10+ years (I believe?) and having tried quitting multiple times just to start back at some point. Any advice for us trying to quit together? I want to be supportive as well as strong for the sake of us doing this together because he does rely on me not giving in to help push him forward.

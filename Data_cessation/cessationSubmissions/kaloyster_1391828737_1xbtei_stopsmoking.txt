[Question] Regarding chest pain

Is this normal on people trying to quit? Woke up and I feel my chest is painful (but tolerable pain), mainly in the center and on the sides (in between the armpits and nipples area)

I hope this is normal.

I had my first craving last night. My heart was racing and the chest pain is much more intense. Glad I powered through.

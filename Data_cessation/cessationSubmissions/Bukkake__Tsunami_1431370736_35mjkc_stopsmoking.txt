[Questions] Looking for experiences from people who have quit smoking and drinking (not necessarily at the same time)

*There's no need to read the whole post (this is going to be long). Comments answering the questions in the Tl;dr are completely sufficient and I'm glad for any responses.*

## **Tl;dr:**

Are there people on this sub who were smokers as well as alcoholics and have managed to kick both addictions for good? I'm very interested to hear your stories and/or how you would compare the first weeks/months of quitting for both substances. The more details, the better. What was harder? How would you compare the process?

I'd especially like to hear from people who have quit both separately, with some time apart. But I'm happy for any input, including people who quit both at the same time.

## **Long part / background (optional):**


***Current Situation / Plans***

I plan to quit smoking within the next 12 months. I know that right now is not the right time, because there's too much else going on at the same time, and I have the tendency to give up all my plans if I put too much on my plate.

This is not something I'm willing to argue btw. I know that as a successful quitter of an addiction, your first instinct is to tell me that "this is just the bullshit story you tell yourself so you don't have to make changes now", and generally I'm inclined to agree with you. You might even be correct in my case, but I'm not here to argue this or be convinced to quit right now. I'm merely interested in other people's experiences, because I think this will be essential on my road towards making the decision.



***Alcohol***

I had been an alcoholic for ~12 years before I quit for good 1.5 years ago (shoutout to /r/stopdrinking!). I can now say that I'm definitely done with it for good. I don't go to AA meetings anymore and I haven't been active on /r/stopdrinking for a year either, I consider the whole thing "behind me", at least in the sense of "I don't wanna bring it up every day/week anymore, I want to look forward". Of course I have to always be vigilant, but that's normal to me now. For example, I always check ingredients in cake for alcohol, etc - or I just don't eat cake if I'm not 100% sure.

Today, I'm incredibly secure in my abstinence, there are zero cravings left and the thought of drinking scares me - I know it would ruin my life, so I'm really happy to stay away. It has become a non-choice/no-brainer. I never expected it to work out this well for me and I'm really grateful that it did.



***Cigarettes***

I've been a smoker for 15 years. About 8-10 years ago I quit twice (first time 4 months, second time 10 weeks), but relapsed both times. There were at least a few months between attempts, I don't remember exactly.

With my experience now I can say for sure that I wasn't in the right mindset to quit back then. A certain lack of self-awareness played a role as well. For example, the first time I relapsed when I got extremely drunk (even though I knew that alcohol was a MAJOR craving catalyst) and bummed a cigarette off a friend. Bought a pack right after and that's that. The 2nd time I used the first major happening in my life as an excuse to start again (I ended a relationship, but it was still pretty rough on me so there was my excuse).

What I do remember from my quitting 8-10 years ago are the VERY frequent cravings. They popped up every day, even after 4 months. Sure, the 15th week was much easier than the 1st, but still it never really became something I felt comfortable with. It was a very annoying part of my life and I was never nearly as secure in my decision to quit smoking as I am now in my decision to quit drinking.



***My own comparison***

I think it would be unreasonable to compare those 2 experiences, given my age difference (early 20s vs. early 30) between them. However, I can't help but notice that quitting the alcohol was easier by a pretty huge margin. After the first few weeks I was very comfortable and after a few months I knew this was for me. Now, after 1.5 years, I know that I'm never going back. My sobriety has survived some hardships that were much worse and more long-term than the breakup 8-10 years ago.

Quitting cigarettes back then was... not as easy. It's true that there's a big difference in mentality and I was never remotely as sure that I wanted to quit cigarettes back then - it was more like "I really should quit", not "This shit has to go".



***Fears***

When I read posts in this sub I can't help but notice that sometimes people relapse after a really long time. It's true that this happens to people with alcoholism (or any other addiction) as well, but what scares me about that is that it's often described as a strong craving out of nowhere, even years later. My own experience with quitting alcohol is completely different. I haven't had what I consider a craving for at least 8 months, probably much longer. And I never even had a *strong* craving after the first few weeks or so.

Also, I'm somewhat afraid that this is going to be much, much harder than quitting alcohol, simply because cigarettes don't really have the direct and obvious life-ruining consequences that alcohol does, at least in most cases. I mean, you're not gonna get fired because you oversleep or call in sick after smoking too many cigarettes last night. So the reasons to quit seem not as strong, at least to me. For example, money has never been something I considered very motivating when it comes to quitting. Same goes for health. I mean, of course I've always been aware of the dangers, but as a young person it's something that feels relevant to the far future, and who cares about that? I've never had any direct and obvious health issues from smoking aside from the usual being out of breath pretty quickly and coughing up a bit of phlegm from time to time.

I have several good reasons to quit smoking, but none are as glaring as "your life is gonna go down the toilet within the next 6 months if you don't quit immediately".



***Why this post?***

I suppose I'm looking for either some reassurance that it's "not gonna be as bad", or, alternatively, realistic estimations of what to expect so I can prepare correctly. I don't wanna "just dive in" and then be overwhelmed by the difficulty of the project after a few days or weeks.

When I make this decision, I want it to be final. So that even if I should relapse, I want to jump right back up on the train like so many people here are able to.

Seriously, major props to all you people who manage to jump right back into it after relapsing instead of wallowing in self-pity and a "well, I tried and failed, so whatever" attitude (like I did back then). You have my utmost respect and I hope that I'm gonna have your strength when I finally jump on the train myself. 8-10 years ago I didn't.

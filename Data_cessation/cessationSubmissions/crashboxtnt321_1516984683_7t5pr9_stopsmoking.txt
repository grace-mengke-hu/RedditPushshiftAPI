Is it OK to be hooked on Lozenges?

I have 5 cigarettes left which I am planning to finish today, and stop smoking from tomorrow. I went out and bought Lozenges today and even had a little trial where I never smoked in the morning, took one, and it seemed to eliminate the craving so was quite happy about that.

I have smoked for roughly 22 years ranging from 10-20 a day. I have tried cold turkey in the past and lasted until day 3 or something pathetic like that.

Is there any health issues with never smoking again but maintaining an addiction to nicotine through Lozenges. Or is my goal to eventually come of the Lozenges, it's just that I think if I stop the Lozenges I will go right back to smoking. Am I even classed as being quit if I am still giving my body nicotine?

My quit date -  27th January 2018.

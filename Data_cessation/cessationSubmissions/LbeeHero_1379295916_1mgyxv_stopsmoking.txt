I said I'd quit in October..

I've been thinking about quitting smoking for ages. 
I'll be joining up to a gym next month, because I am just sick of having to look in the mirror everyday.. I want to change.
I want to be able to walk around without having to reach for my inhaler every now an then (i have asthma & i smoke, iknow its horrible)
I also want to help my GF , shes also trying to quit. Shes tried but idont know if shes doing good.
I want to succeed, an if I can, I want to help her.

I had a cigarette just a few hours ago(my last) and I was just looking in my wallet to see if I'll have enough to purchase another , until I had a epiphany. 

"Why don't you quit now?"
Was all that was going through my head .

I have made my decision . 

Today is the day.

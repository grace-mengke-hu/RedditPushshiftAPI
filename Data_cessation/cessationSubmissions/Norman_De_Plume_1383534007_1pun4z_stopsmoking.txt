It's time to quit (again)..

I had previously quit in 2007 after smoking 20 a day for roughly 7 years, this lasted until two and a half years ago, am now back on 20 a day. 

I went completely cold turkey that time and plan to adopt the same approach with this attempt, as I feel that using nicotine patches/gum/inhalers don't help with losing the addiction - they only postpone the inevitable nicotine withdrawal.

Was wondering if any of you guys have good tips for surviving the first 3 days of quitting? i.e. reducing irritability, cravings etc...

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

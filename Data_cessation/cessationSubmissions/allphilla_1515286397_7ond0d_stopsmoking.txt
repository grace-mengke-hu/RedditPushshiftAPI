4 days 12 hours cigarette free

I’ve been smoking for almost 20 years and finally had enough and decided to quit for my health, but mostly for my kids.  

I’ve been using an ecig as a bit of a crutch for the nicotine, but haven’t had a single cigarette, nor really the desire for one.  I want to be completely nicotine free and drop the ecig by the end of the year. 

It’s hard, and I sympathize with all of you out there.  But smoking sucks, and we can make ourselves better. 

Good luck to all of you out there.  You got this!

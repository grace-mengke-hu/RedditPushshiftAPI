First time user, looking for any advice or techniques to help me quit smoking cigarettes

Hello, this is my first time using reddit, i'm not sure how much of this works yet, so i apologize in advance if i have poor reddiquette, i'm happy to hear any suggestions to help me out if I've made any mistakes on that subject. This will be my first post, and I really hope I find what i'm seeking. 

I've been smoking cigarettes for about 3 years. now, it is a gross habit that I have tried to quit a couple times, but haven't made any progress, each smoke I have, I think about how much I want to quit, but the craving seems to win every time. I have faith that i can quit, i just need some advice, some suggestions about how i can stop myself from falling back into this hole after i've quit. if anyone has any suggestions, please, let me know. I want to change. 

Thanks for taking the time to read this and please, if you have any suggestions, advice, or anything that can help me, please share! :)

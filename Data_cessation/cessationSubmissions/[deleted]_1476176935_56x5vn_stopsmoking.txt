Hi everyone

Hi all....day 1 of my smoking cessation journey today :-) It has helped me to read some of the posts on here first thing..I am now just getting used to the site. 
I am feeling positive if a little 'bereaved' -going cold turkey-but I know its just my mind playing tricks on me and that it is a temporary state. Gotta go through it to get through it unfortunately....
Thankyou old and new quitters
for all your posts .. reading them helps with the cravings....

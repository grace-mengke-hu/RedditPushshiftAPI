So I think I've done it.

I'm coming up on twelve hours in. I'll give you updates on the deterioration of my situation. Haha. Just kidding, hopefully. I went to bed early last night, made foods this a.m. and have so far denied myself a few thoughts on taking a puff but I know it's just the beginning...

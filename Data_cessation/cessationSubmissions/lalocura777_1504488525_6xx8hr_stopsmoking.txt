Last hours of my first day:

I started with nicotine patches and that, to be honest, helped a lot. I'm at the end of the treatment (7ml) Today was my first day without any cigarettes. I started well, I played a tennis match with a work colleague. It feels good. Wish me luck and good luck to all. (Sorry for the weir english, not a native speaker)

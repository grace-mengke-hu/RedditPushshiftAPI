Dreams about all the things im trying to change?

Im 8 days in and last night I had a dream that I had my old ecig back and I was smoking it like I usually do. Then I went to a party and ate a ton of food while puffing my ecig. Then I woke up with a craving.  

Did anyone else have dreams about smoking after quitting?

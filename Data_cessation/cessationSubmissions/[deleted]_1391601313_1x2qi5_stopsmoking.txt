I'm around 30 minutes away from 4 full days.

And I couldn't be happier with the way I'm traveling. I'm using gum and have only used 3 pieces today, down from smoking 25 16mg cigarettes per day for a bit more than 3 years.

Is there anything I should know about the next couple of weeks that could surprise me?

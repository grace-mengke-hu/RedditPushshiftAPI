A change of perspective.

So whenever I have "cravings" or I'm "triggered", I've started to associate that feeling with reward, pleasure, joy, etc., as opposed to the anxiety of not letting myself or not being able smoke. 

When it happens I begin to remember that those feelings or chemicals (nicotine, etc.) no longer and will never again dictate my actions. That feeling then turns into a somewhat addrenaline type buzz. A sense of pride, strength, self respect.  

For example, when I see a smoker on the street or in their car, I don't let the jealousy take hold and feel like I wish I too could be smoking. What I do think, is of how bad and sorry I feel for that smoker for doing so much harm to themselves like I once did. 

It's then that I'm over joyed and appreciative that I'm no longer in that sickening addictive trap.

My first time!

Hello r/stopsmoking. I haven’t been on reddit in a very long time but I made it a point to come on and post here. It is my first time trying to ACTUALLY quit. I’ve talked about it here and there but never made a true effort. Well it’s day 3 and it’s tough. But I’m doing my best to quit. My girlfriend hates it and I’m thinking about asking her to marry me. So I’m id like to do this, for not only me, but for us. Thanks for listening to me ramble!

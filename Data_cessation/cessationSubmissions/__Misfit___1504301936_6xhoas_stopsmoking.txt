trying to quit smoking every 2 months or so, for the past year and a half

Anyway. This whole ordeal with quitting and starting again is getting pretty old.
English is not my first language, so please don't cringe at my grammar :)

I am smoking for about 20 years, pack a day. Im trying to quit on and of for the past 10 years.
I have trouble breathing for the better part of that time. 
But last week I got diagnosed with asthma (which was probably brought on by my smoking).
I also did a chest x-ray - doctor haven't called so I guess everything is alright with my lungs.

I know I have to quit - soon - but I just can't muster up the courage to do it. 

I am taking corticosteroids for asthma and Im still smoking. If I don't quit smoking the whole treatment will be for nothing.
Im not happy about taking steroids, they can have crazy side effects to be honest and the whole ordeal is a bit scary.

So.. I'm sitting here, thinking why am I doing this to myself and how the hell can I decide and just stop. And how crazy you have to be to have asthma, taking steroids and still smoke. 

I don't even know why I'm posting this. Probably hoping some miracle is going to happen and desire for smoking will disappear :)

any advice how to set my mind to quit for real and just do it?

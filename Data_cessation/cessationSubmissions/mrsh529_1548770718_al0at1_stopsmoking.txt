Today I am ONE YEAR smoke-free!

Quit cold-turkey on year ago...I cannot believe I am here … AGAIN … I've quite numerous times for a year and always went back to smoking.  I don't know how I will stop that from happening again, but hoping by being aware of it that I can stay away.   My SO still smokes so it's difficult, and this past year has been difficult, but it is getting even.   The last couple of weeks I've had a couple of strong urges, but did not smoke...I want to stay that way.   To everyone going through this struggle I wish you the best....we can do this!!!

Ready to quit the quit.

Twelve days cold turkey. I have been insane for all of it. Shitty to everyone. I'm miserable. Bored. Depressed. Sad. Annoyed. I am about over it. I can't even say I feel better. This is my first time trying to quit.....maybe it's not time yet. I see now it isn't scary, and that I can do it. Maybe I shouldn't have picked right NOW to quit. I have a lot going on at the moment... I don't know. Help!

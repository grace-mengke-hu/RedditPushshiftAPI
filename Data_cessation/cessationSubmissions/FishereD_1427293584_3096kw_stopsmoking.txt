Goodbye lighter collection!

Hey guys! I just decided to throw away my pack and go cold-turkey. I noticed that I still had a lot of lighters and even kept one with me, throwing those away definitely made it more concrete that I was quitting. After the moment of doubt on whether I should keep my lighters for a just-in-case scenario, I got rid of them and do feel a little more motivated about this.

Here's to the first day!

Stopped 21 days ago

I stopped smoking on New Years.  I smoked for 12 years before this, with brief quitting attempts.  I find I am tired all the time to the point where I can't focus on anything.  I get irritated over next to nothing.  All I can think about is how much I wish I was smoking.  In 21 days I've noted no benefits and managed to upset my best friends and girlfriend.  I was a better person as a smoker, I think.  I'm using an ecigarette but it doesn't feel like it's doing much.  

I kind of just wish I felt better in *any* way.  As of now, quitting has done nothing but save me a couple bucks that I probably spent getting too drunk to care about smoking anyway.  I'm sick of being tired and angry, any advice is appreciated.

Second day

Hi guys, I'm a 19 year old guy who decided to quit ciggaretes. I wanted to quit them for a long time now, but I'm a little overweight so I always used an excuse like I can't stop because I'll get fatter, I don't want to stop because I'll just start again etc. Well I decided that shit is bullshit, and I stopped smoking yesterday and started training. Fyi I smoked pack, pack and a half for more then three years. I hate that I ever started that shit. Worse thing is I started with Marlboro red and was smoking it for my whole duration. Thanks for reading and good luck to me and to you guys.

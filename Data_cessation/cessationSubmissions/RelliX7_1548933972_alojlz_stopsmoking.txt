Started quitting but gradually

So I started the process of quitting (if we can name it that way) and this is my 3rd day. 
I've been smoking for 4+ years now and I started hate myself for this bad habit. I've stopped smoking for 10 days last year but I didn't manage to keep myself away from cigarettes. 
I have decided now to quit this shit by doing it slowly. 

My routine was like this :
- 1 cigarette in the morning before work 
- 1 to 2 at break (between 10am to 12)
- 2 at lunch break 
- 2 in the afternoon before 5pm 
- 3 to 4 in the evening 

My actual routine: 
- 1 at lunch break 
- 1 after work (5pm)
- 1 to 2 in the evening 

Now I'm trying to get rid of the evening cigarettes and I'm hoping that by the end of the week I'll be smoke free. 

What do you think about this method? I don't want to go cold Turkey since I know that I won't achieve it and I rather prefer to do it gradually than doing it one shot and risking the fact of going back to slimming heavily. 

Also, the main reason why I smoke is when I get angry.. And I do get angry very often, do to work or personal problems. 

Can you guys help with advices and tips to stay away from smoking and managing my anger? 

Thanks in advance, this subreddit is awesome.

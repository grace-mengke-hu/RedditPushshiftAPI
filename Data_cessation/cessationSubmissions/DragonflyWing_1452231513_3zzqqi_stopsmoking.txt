Relapse after almost 2 weeks. Anyone else quitting again after a false start?

I quit on December 26th, and went 12 days without a cigarette. I didn't really have cravings, and I was feeling really good. 

Then after work tonight I got this sudden all encompassing craving. I couldn't think of anything else, and almost on autopilot, I bought a pack :( I've smoked 3, so I need to reset my quit date. I'm kicking myself for not being able to resist. argh.

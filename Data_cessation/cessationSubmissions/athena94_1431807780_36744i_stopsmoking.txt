A question for the ladies....

I'm currently eight days clean from the horrible cancer sticks :) 

However, I started my cycle yesterday. This whole entire week I've been fine until I got my period. I smoked like a CHIMNEY when I was on my period. And now instead of the usual slightly hormonal bitchiness, I'm 10x more irritated. Depressed, almost. Thank god for my vape because I probably would've gave in by now. 

Any other lady quitters struggle with this?

trouble with long term quitting

hi all. Been smoking for 15 years. I have "quit" many times before, once going about 2 months no smoking. I seem to have no trouble stopping for a few weeks at a time and getting nicotine out of my system. I run into trouble long term- like the psychological addiction is greater than the physical addiction. Anyone else experience this and what has worked for you to finally QUIT?

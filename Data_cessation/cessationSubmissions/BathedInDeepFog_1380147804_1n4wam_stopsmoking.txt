I need to find nicotine patches...

Hello, 

I'm new to this sub, so please excuse me if this has been addressed several times before.

 I have heard that there are programs out there that offer free nicotine patches for those who are trying to stop smoking. I can't really afford to buy tobacco anymore, so it's either cold turkey or some sort of free nicotine replacement therapy. I would much prefer the latter. Any advice that anyone can give me will be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

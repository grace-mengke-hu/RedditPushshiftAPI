22 days and It's been a tame roller coaster.

I decided to quit smoking ages ago but waited until I moved on the 1st of this month to start to take advantage of a new perspective. So far so good. Days 8 and 9 were the most difficult. I could rationalize a week of not smoking, but facing the reality of what I was doing really set in around then. Since then, I have almost zero cravings and I use this awesome sub to keep track of the days and read about others going through the same thing. No more.

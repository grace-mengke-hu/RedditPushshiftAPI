Happy New Year!

Got through the holidays! 

There were some struggles and quite a few cravings, particularly at the end of week 3, but made it to 30 days! Now I'm going through long periods of not thinking about it, then having moments where I think "hang on, I should be craving!" 

To all those who are just starting - it really does get easier as time passes. It's not super-easy now but compared to the first week it's a breeze. As stupid as it sounds the trick is literally just to not smoke. As each moment passes just don't smoke. Minute by minute, as each one goes by without smoking you've achieved something. Then a minute might pass when you don't think about it. Then two. Then five. Before you know it there'll be hours that go by without thinking about smoking. All the while the benefits keep racking up, as does the money. I've just got myself a new computer from just one month's savings.

To those 30+ days - I'm right behind you! Your successes are inspirational and a distraction from personal cravings. It's great to know we're all in it together.

Good luck going into the new year everyone!

The end of an era..

Tldr: what to do with leftover smokes? (sounds a bit silly when I put it like that, I know)

Well I made it through my first smokefree weekend.. it wasn't so bad, although I am definitely much crankier than usual, and feeling quite tired.

I have one thing I am still trying to work out.  Initially I was going on patches and planned to gradually reduce over 2 weeks.  After less than 48 hours on NRT (And after reading other people's stories) I decided screw that poison, cold turkey it is! 

As a result there are 2 cigarettes left in my packet that I hadn't planned on dealing with and it may seem stupid but I'm not sure what to do with them... just chuck them out, hold on to them as a reminder, carry out some sort of ceremony? 

What did other people do?

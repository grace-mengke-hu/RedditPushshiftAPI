2 months today!

I'm 24. This is the longest I've gone without smoking in 10 years. 

A few things I've learned...

- It gets better. I promise you, it gets easier and it gets better. 

- Smoking makes you anxious as hell and the anxiety of initial withdrawal is so, so worth the difference. 

- Smoking makes you numb. I'm learning to deal with emotions I usually would have shut down with a swift puff on a smoke, that releases dopamine. It's amazing and terrible at the same time but I love it. 

- No person on this earth could pay me enough money to pick up a cigarette again. Not even Bill Gates. It is toxic, it is disgusting and quite frankly I'm horrified we don't do more to come down on the industry. 

- A few things for new quitters to look forward to: a new sense of smell and taste (amazing), more energy, being able to breathe deeply, not smelling gross, not tasting gross, more money, a sense of pride and - honestly - better orgasms. 

It's so, so worth it guys. Some days I still get cravings but my brain now regards them as nicotine cravings instead of cigarette cravings (the idea of smoking a cigarette is gross to me now), and I can dodge nicotine cravings more easily these days because *I don't want to go back to being an addict*

Stay strong, keep venting, keep doing your best and never be afraid about starting again - I can't even begin to list how many times I've failed before but this one really feels different!

Thanks for being here r/stopsmoking. You've really, really bloody helped me out.

How to overcome urges after 7days of quitting ?

I'm 25, been heavily smoking both weed and cigarettes for past 3years. I finally went cold turkey last Friday. I thought I would go insane with withdrawals and cravings, but i didn't. But now the urges have become really strong, especially if i see someone else smoking in real life or in a show/video. Help me out if you guys have any tips.

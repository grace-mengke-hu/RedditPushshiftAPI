Any experience using an app to quit smoking?

On day 13 without cigarettes, but vaping and using https://smokefreeapp.com for motivation. I actually think it has helped me a lot. Doing all the missions and getting stats on money saved, health improvements, seeing how cravings decline, keeps me motivated. All the applause and happy gif's does lees. 
Anyone had success with this kind of apps?

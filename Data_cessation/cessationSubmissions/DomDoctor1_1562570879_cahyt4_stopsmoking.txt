Mental health and life hygiene

Hey guys.Currently on a 24 days streak of not smoking.I'm 24 and have been smoking for 7 years, towards the end ,i was smoking a pack a day.
In the last year this and my other addictions have given me alot of anxiety ,self guilt and have made me not love myself that much.I still struggle with feelings of worthlessness but i have sometbing to be proud about.
My anxiety got so bad that back in november i had a huge panic attack that made me quit cold turkey ,also i had given up coffee at that point ,for close to 45 days.After my anxiety had gone away and I learned to deal with the panic attacks in general ,I started smoking again.
Ever since 2 months ago things got really bad ,i would wake up in the morning ,drink my coffee ,smoke almost half a pack till 16:00 PM ,gorge myself with food ,another half a pack till 2:00AM,eat again and go to sleep at 4:00 Am ,and repeat.This gave me horrible acid reflux , insomnia and made me feel like shit in general.It all culminated 3 and a half weeks ago ,when I woke up , had the same routine , went out with my gf to eat but i started having a panic attack again ,only this time , and I know this sounds fucking stupid ,I couldn t stop swallowing and burping air ,non stop ,every 3 to 4 seconds.I thought i went mad ,the episode lasted for almost 2 hours ,i felt like I was gonna pass out , my gf was supportive but after she told me it's all in my head she had enough of this and left me alone ,went into the bathroom of the mall I was in and I started looking at myself in the mirror thinking I was gonna die.....but I didn't ,and I didn't smoke since then ,and things got better ,I started taking cold showers ,exercising ,having a better sleep schedule , and feeling better in general.I still remained with some reflux and anxiety when I leave my dorm or I am in a stressfull situation ,i keep swallowing air but it happens twice or 3 times a day and doesn't last long.My point is this:
1.I am a 5th year medical student ,I have never had any auditory or visual hallucination ,nothing that would put me in the range of serious mental health .Regarding physical health ,maybe some slight gastritis ,I will go and have a full set of tests soon.
2.I have read alot on this topic and what I have found out is that smokers:
-have more anxiety 
-have more chances of panic attacks and mental health problems 
-have huge ammounts of receptors for nicotine in their brain that lower their numbers after 1 month,thus making you feel less anxious
3.My own experience...I feel more confident in myself ,I never would have imagined the fact that I would enjoy life without smoking ,less being able to actually quit ,fear is what made me quit ,the fear of being a nervous wreck all the time and the fear that i might lose my mental and physical health.
Deal with your problems and be the master of your own destiny ,this year I have been through hell and back ,a constant barage of hits from life ,but what truly builds character and makes life exciting and meaningfull is how you react and what you learb when you go through rough times...
Thank you for this sub,and stay strong my brothers.Sorry for any mistakes ,english is not my native language.

3 days in...

Not my first attempt, but definitely feeling more motivated than ever to succeed in the long run.

Decided to stop on friday after work. The weekend was pretty difficult but I made it. Now I'm back at work and just trying to make it through the day. It's particularly hard when I have to walk past the smokers area several times a day.... oh it smells like heaven out there. 

Anyway. going strong. Feeling particularly good today actually. All this fresh air is doing me good :D

also.. turns out coffee tastes like ass when you don't have cigarettes.

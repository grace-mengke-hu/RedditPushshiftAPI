How did you know that you had become addicted to smoking?

Hello all,

I am worried that my smoking cigarettes may turn into an addiction, and I need to know how or when that line is crossed. 

I am 24, generally clean, though I do drink and smoke weed quite a bit. I have cut back on both tremendously, and have always been afraid of cigarettes, since my mother has an addiction and this addiction used to bother me as a child. When I first tried smoking (offered by girl I had recently starting seeing, drunk, around new people) I realized I really enjoyed smoking and became afraid right off the bat since. In the last few months, I have a had a few stressors I won't get into, and I have smoked more tobacco in hookah lounges and cigarettes socially. Yesterday, I bought my first cigarillo to deal with stress, and right now, feeling stressed again, I had another craving. 

My mother has been addicted for over 30 years. Many others in my family also have been addicted for decades. 

I'm really freaking out because I don't know if this is how it begins or not. I'd really appreciate it if someone broke down the process of addiction or how it happens, or has a link that describes it. I think it can really help people like me who may just be beginning to smoke, but who don't necessarily know the signs. 

Thank you so much for any information and advice.

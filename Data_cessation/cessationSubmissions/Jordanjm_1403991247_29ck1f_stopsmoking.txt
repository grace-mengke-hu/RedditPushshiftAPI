I feel like I simply can't handle things without smoking!

I'm 23 and I've been smoking since I was 14. I've tried quitting smoking many times and even tried things like the gum and ecigs (which don't do this it just made me smoke more when I went back!) 

I feel like since such a huge chunk of my life has involved smoking that I simply cannot handle simple life stresses without smoking. I got about 2 weeks out recently and I feel like every little thing just made my blood boil and I could feel my heartbeat in my neck. What kind of advice would you have for someone like me? I know I'm not the only one who has grown into an adult smoking and having that to always fall back on.

Really need support

This will be my probably about 20th time trying to quit smoking. I've never been able to get past even the third day. I'm 19 years old and have been smoking probably half a pack a day for 4 or 5 years now. I used to be a fantastic wrestler and boxer, but my lungs are probably not even a quarter of what they used to be. I can barely breathe most days.

Smoking has been pretty important to my life nonetheless. Everyone in my family smokes. No matter where I go there's always a cigarette or someone smoking at all times of the day.

Basically,  is there anyone here who thought that there would be absolutely no hope of ever quitting and somehow managed? I'm trying again tomorrow. But no matter how many times I try I just don't see myself ever really being free of it. I can't see myself being happy without cigarettes, but I know sure as hell I'm not happy with them. They've sapped any athletic ability I had and I feel like an old man with no energy.

Day One -- Using NRT

I've been smoking 6 years, and I always kept giving myself a quit date far in the future. "I'll quit when I get physically fit." "I'll quit if I get married." "I'll quit the day I get pregnant". 
The latter two are unlikely to happen within the next few years, so I decided to get a head start. I'm tired of being so ashamed and so embarrassed. 
I run a restaurant, and a great deal of my staff smokes, so I am very nervous about going back to work. I have told several employees and friends that I am quitting to try to give myself accountability, but I am terrified of relapsing and making a fool of myself. 
Thus far I feel the patches (Habitrol) are helping. Did anyone feel that using NRT was beneficial to their success in quitting? Is it a hinderance? Are you still guaranteed to gain weight if you are eating healthy and working out regularly?

Everything at once is running through my mind and I know in the morning when I first wake up it will be the most challenging hurdle. 
Fighting the craving.

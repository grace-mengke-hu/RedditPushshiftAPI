I’ve had enough

This is my first time posting absolutely anything on Reddit. Within a helpful app I’m using, I think it’s day 3 or 4 ish “challenges” you to look up 5 success stories and has a link to this sub. And I’ve gotta say I’m as incredibly impressed as I am fully motivated to quit smoking thanks to some of your posts! 

I finally decided to quit after struggling with an abundance of stress and anxiety. I was sick of always relying on smoking to calm my nerves. Also sick of the bad breath, the shortness of breath, just in general all the things that accompany smoking. 

So far today I’m only a week in, and most of you know why I use the term “only” , but I’m staying positive and I’m doing my best to look at it as “hey, I’m already a week smoke free!!”

I’ve tried countless times, as I’m sure most of us have. And countless times I’ve given in again and again. But a small but powerful quote that gets me through is short and sweet, “never quit quitting”

I’ll be thinking of all of you who want to quit, are trying to quit, and have quit for however long. It’s incredibly tough. But surprisingly my cravings have been very little so far (knock on wood). 

Keep it up! It’s never easy, but damn if the outcome and rewards aren’t outta this world! I believe in you! And as it is so far helping me, I hope it helps you too, NEVER QUIT QUITTING!!

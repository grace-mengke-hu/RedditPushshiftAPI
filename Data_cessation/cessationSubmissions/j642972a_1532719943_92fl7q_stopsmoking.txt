Timing

So I have a nicotine/cotinine drug test coming up. I smoked 6-10 cigs a day for 3 years and for the past year I have been using a 5mg nicotine vape as a nic replacement therapy device. This is day 2 of no nicotine at all for the first time in 4 years. I feel like shit. I have a date that I really want to go on though. Any tips for ways to feel better for this date?

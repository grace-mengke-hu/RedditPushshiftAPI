A request for talking some sense into me!

Quit more than a year ago (never made a tag for myself), had one on May 5th after a day of beverages. Since then I've been thinking about it constantly (what a powerful drug). I got a 78% on my steel design exam and a 71% on my concrete design class and really disappointed in myself.

I snuck a cig out of my dad's pack and am saving it for when I'm done studying for the night (another exam tomorrow). I know I shouldn't, but as pathetic as it is; I don't think I can go put it back in my dad's pack instead of smoking it. I'm still studying and need someone to talk me out of it before I'm done! mehhhh!

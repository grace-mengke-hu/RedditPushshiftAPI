Caved in after six weeks

Hey all, six weeks ago I quit smoking cold turkey. I got through it pretty well and the urges the weren't too bad. Foolishly I picked up a pack this afternoon and smoked 3 cigarettes. I feel guilty and ashamed that I did this and thought maybe I'd nail it on my first attempt as it went pretty well.

I was a pack or more a day smoker for 4 years.

My question is, should I expect nicotine withdrawal to return? I've gotten rid of the pack and am determined to keep on the straight and narrow but I'm worried I may have reset something. I noticed the urge to smoke come back after just that one cigarette and was feeling pretty antsy.

Thank you and hope you all stay quit.

I totally missed my 1 year "anniversary", I never even think about smoking anymore. It's the most amazing thing :)

June 6th, the day came and went and I didn't even realize it until a few days later. It's crazy how fast the year went by and how smoking is basically a distant memory now. It was a part of my life for over 10 years. Until I read a book and thought "I should just quit now, why not today?" and I did it and I haven't looked back. I will say for me personally, it's been surprisingly easy to quit. I believed it would be easy and so it was. 

This past year has been full of positives in my life. Feels great :) 
Keep strong everyone, it only gets better and better!

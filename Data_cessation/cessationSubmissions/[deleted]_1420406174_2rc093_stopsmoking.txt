Replying to posts

I'm a little confused, I am reading the posts here and replying to the ones I feel are helpful to me, but it seems I'm not supposed to?  I went to reply to one and got this... "you are doing that too much. try again in 21 seconds"  Doing what too much? Congratulating people who are doing so well?

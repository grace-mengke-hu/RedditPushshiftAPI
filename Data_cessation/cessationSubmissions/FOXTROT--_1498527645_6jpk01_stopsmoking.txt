It's pretty daunting.

I smoke a bunch, in frequency as well as the quantity of cigarettes that I inhale into my lungs. If I don't have a cigarette in the morning, I turn into the old lady at the end of Mrs.Doubtfire that the family was interviewing to fill the position of the new nanny. 

I obviously cannot do this anymore, my whole routine revolves around smoking. I'm tired of having Japanese folklore heaved out of my esophagus every time I cough. I'm tired of not being happy or panicked when I don't have cigarettes. I'm just done. Obviously the solution would be easy right? Just wish I had the balls and patience to do it.

More than 3 weeks now, I rarely think about smoking now!

Just a little rant and reflection of my latest quit attempt that well, has worked. I have tried in past, but this time it's for real and once my mind was set to it, everything else followed.

The days start to rack up quickly, the first 2-3 days might be very hard...but then you feel like you're doing so good, to reset it and start again from day 1 would be such a waste...and so the days start to build, then its a week... and then you stop even counting...and just like that, it's all gone from your life. 

I seriously am MIND BLOWN that just a week or two after stopping, I can smell things I never could smell, my entire sense of smell was pretty much gone because of smoking...food taste better...and BREATHING. Wow. 

I swear to god you will notice it in a week or two, being outside, walking, and you take a breath, and its such an overwhelmingly big, deep breath of clean fucking air, and every breath feels so deep, and clean and pure, and it actually feels amazing. A thing as simple as breathing how everyone has been will feel like such an amazing thing! It is so drastically different, and I can never go back to strangling myself of this feeling. 

Suddenly feeling more energetic every day, feeling better, started working out again and everything is falling in to place :D

Stay motivated! The initial hurdle is the hardest, then it's smooth sailing. Know your triggers and avoid/block/deal with them!

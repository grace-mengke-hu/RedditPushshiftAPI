Mental breakdown at day 9

I quit smoking 9 days ago and quit using the patch 4 days ago. Today I cried for an hour. I'm still crying. I can't stop thinking about all the failures in my life. I feel like I have nowhere to go. I feel like there is no escape from this addiction. I have a dentist appointment on Tuesday and I don't know if I can sit on that chair for an hour with my mouth open. 

I'm thinking about using a patch right now.

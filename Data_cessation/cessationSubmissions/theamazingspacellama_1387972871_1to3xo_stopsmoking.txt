Can't be prescribed Chantix

Hello, I realized I was a really bad smoker about two years ago, and it's appeared nearly impossible to quit. I've asked my doctor several times to prescribe me something like Chantix, but because of my medications and mental illness (schizophrenia), it would be a bad idea. So, I've bought maybe a months worth of lozenges and I'm just not slowing down on them (Happened a year ago as well). I've also tried the nicotine patches, but it's not strong enough to stop the cravings. I can't keep buying nicotine cessation because the main problem I have with smoking or even the cessation is the money and how I desperately need to cut my spending. Thanks guys, any advice is very well appreciated.

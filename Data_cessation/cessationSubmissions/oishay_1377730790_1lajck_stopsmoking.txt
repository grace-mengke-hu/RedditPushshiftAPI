Tracking days stopped smoking good or bad?

I don't know guys I mean I am happy for anyone who has made a good achievement and given up smoking and I have no problems at all with people posting about how long they've quit for it makes me so happy. All you people are the reason I have given up. 

But I just have to think once you give up smoking why count the period of time that you stopped it's like you always remember that you smoked. Do you know of anyone who just gave up and decided from this day on I don't smoke and never talk about me quitting.

Almost didn't make it today.

I've been having a rough go of it. I read Alan Carr's book, I tried Chantix, tried hypnotism, meditation, positive thinking the whole lot. I've gotten myself 25 days along but I started having serious psychological issues from the Chantix. So I went off the Chantix which didn't go well  and was causing horrible panic attacks today. I couldn't quite figure out if this was a result of going off the medication or if this is just what quitting smoking without medication feels like. Somebody handed me a cigarette, and just holding it made the panic subside. I didn't smoke it, when I realized but the Panic slow down I realized I didn't have to smoke again. I did get zero nicotine Vape to bridge me between coming off the Chantix and being fully ready to be a non-smoker. Maybe it's a pacifier But I'm happy that I didn't cave and reintroduce nicotine to my system after almost a month. I really wish I could have been the kind of person the Allen Carr talks about in his book that just walked away and enjoyed it or whatever, but I'm not that person. The idea of feeling like this every day for the rest of my life honestly freaked me out. So you're if you're at this place and and you can't make your subconscious live up to the same standard other people seem to be able to do, Maybe you don't want to use a replacement but also don't be afraid to use a replacement if you need to. One method doesn't work for everybody. I don't know if this helps anybody but it helped me today.

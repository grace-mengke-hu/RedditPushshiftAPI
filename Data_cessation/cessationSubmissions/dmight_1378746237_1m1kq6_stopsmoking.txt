My first week. It wasn't as hard as I thought it would be

Hello there, 

This is the first time I have tried to quit. I thought my experience might be useful to someone and thought about sharing it here. 

First of all I smoked for about 5 years. The first 4 years I smoked about half a pack a day and then this last year I started smoking 1 pack per day. 

I always wanted to quit but I didn't want to bad enough. I recently lost a lot of weight and have been exercising and I felt like I was limiting my improvements because of smoking so I started trying to convince myself that I had to stop. I thought it was hard for me to decide to quit because I thought it would be VERY difficult to quit.

Eventually I decided I am going to quit soon and started reading about what way would be best for me. I wanted to quit cold turkey but then I read about withdrawal symptoms. I did not want to go through them. Then I thought about nicotine patches, but I thought I might not have the discipline to keep the patch on. Then I talked to my vaping(ecigs) buddy and thought I might try that. 

I bought one of those vaporizers that cost me about 70 dollars and bought me a flavor with menthol(medium nicotine strength) on it (I used to smoke camel menthol). Buying a higher quality device might reduce my excuses. 

Last Monday I smoked my last cigarette and I have been using the vaporizer and it has been EASY. The vaporizer I bought gives me the kick I got with cigarettes and the nicotine to reduce withdrawal symptoms. I did buy medium strength nicotine because I do plan on reducing the strength and eventually completely stop my nicotine consumption. It has definitely been effective and I have gained a ton of confidence in my ability to quit. I am doing it!

TLDR; Quitting smoking (so far) is A LOT easier than I thought thanks to my vaporizer.

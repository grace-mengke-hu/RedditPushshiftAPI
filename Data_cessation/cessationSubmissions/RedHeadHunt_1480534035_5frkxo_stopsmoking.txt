I think I am really free

561 days without a smoke 

I am finally at the point where I go days without a craving 

Well two nights ago I smoked one hand rolled  cigarette. I was drinking but made the decision counciously. Yesterday I work up and didn't even want one. Today I have been amazed at the fact that I went the last 24 house not thinking about smoking. The only thing that reminded me was this sub in my feed. I think I might be mostly through the fight.

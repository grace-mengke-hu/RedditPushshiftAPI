Irritable and impatient...but the first four days were great!

Today is Day 5 of quitting smoking. I am using Champix, not NRT. The nicotine should be out of my system by now but for some reason I am super irritable and impatient. I even had a little headache today. The first four days were great. Zero withdrawal symptoms minus mild cravings. Any advice on how to kick this feeling? Heeeelp.

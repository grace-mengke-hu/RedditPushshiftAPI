Hanging out with smokers.

I went to my parents house recently, and where we all gather is out on the porch. Everyone drinks, relaxes, and some smoke. 

After two days of hanging out back there experiencing second hand smoke, I woke up with a sore throat and saw blood after blowing my nose. 

I am so glad I quit, and so happy that I don't have to have that as my daily reality anymore. Seeing a glimpse of my old symptoms was shocking. I'm proud of myself for sticking with this.

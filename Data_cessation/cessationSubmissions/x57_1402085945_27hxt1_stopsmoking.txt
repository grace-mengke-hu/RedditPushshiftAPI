Are my cravings at this point still physical or are they completely psychological?

It's been 11 days. I'm still having some strong cravings, just not as often. Is there still a physical dependence triggering these or is it psychological? Is there a time frame when I can expect these to go away? Kinda driving me crazy. Thanks guys, stay strong.

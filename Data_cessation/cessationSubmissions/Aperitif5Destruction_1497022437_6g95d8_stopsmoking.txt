Approaching two months, cravings are kicking in hard lately.

Like the title says, I'm 50-something days in and lately I have been having the strongest cravings. I'll suddenly think "man, you know what would be great right now?" and then remember I can't have one and get super bummed out. Please tell me this goes away. I was going strong for so long and it seems to have gotten worse lately.

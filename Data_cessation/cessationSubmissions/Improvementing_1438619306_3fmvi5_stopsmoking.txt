Psyching myself up to quit, any tips?

I have smoked on and off for close to 20 years. I have tried every method of quitting smoking: nicotine gum, vapes. losenges, candy, motivational videos, etc. 

I managed to quit the longest on nicotine gum (around 6 years) but, and this is embarrassing, I NEVER QUIT THE GUM. 

So it occurred to me that the only method I have never tried is the simplest one- cold turkey. I have never gotten the nicotine out of my system. 

I am a little scared of doing it this way, but if I am being honest with myself, it is the only way I am actually going to succeed in quitting for good. Right now I am just under a pack a day. I have around a half a pack left. So, tomorrow? 

I'm posting this now so that I can't pretend I didn't make the plan to do this. The plan I have formed in my mind is to get home from work tonight around 10pm, have a drink and a last smoke, take a shower and wake up owning zero cigarettes, and start day one. Is this a good plan?

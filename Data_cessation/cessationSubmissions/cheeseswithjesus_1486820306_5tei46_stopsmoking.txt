Is it possible to quit smoking and smoke here and there later on

I'm on my 6th day smoke free. I guess you could consider I was a light smoker. The most I've been at is 10/day and more recently before I decided to quit I was smoking 1-5/day. I like to be active and I noticed a laziness and 'out of breath' happening even from such a little amount and didn't want to continue like that. Plus the whole health thing haha. 

A cigarette at social gatherings is awesome. I was thinking maybe after I've gone smoke free for at least 66 days (that's apparently how long it takes to develop a habit) I could smoke here and there again without getting back into it. I won't buy packs, will only take cigarettes offered at parties. I figure if I don't buy a pack I won't have any laying around to tempt me. Parties go on only every couple of months so I think id be ok. But idk maybe I'm naive. What do you guys think? Do you know of anyone who's done this?

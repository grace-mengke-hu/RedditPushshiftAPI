Week went by and somehow I feel worse than ever.

Hi everyone. I'm feeling awful. I'm an ex 1.5 - 2 packs a day passionate smoker for 14ish years now. I've quit smoking in the past several times, longest for 2 straight years. Today is my 8th day off cigs. Quit cold turkey. I thought the worst is behind me but, I feel like absolute shit today. Anxiety is killing me. I feel like someone is standing on my stomach and throat, i can't breathe. I can't focus, talk or anything. I just want to curl in a ball. Or smoke. And it's not going away! Help.

Smoked for the first time.

I smoked for the first time last night at a party.

Just a little background:

I am 21 years old, I drink occasionally. When I drink, I go all out but it happens like every 2 months or so. Last night I was drunk and at the party there were people smoking and a cigarette was passed to me and I just didn’t think much of it. I figured that i was inhaling a bunch of smoke anyway from the surroundings so I may as well try it. I took like 4 puffs. I made sure they were small because I had never smoked before. Maybe a 3rd of the cigarette at most. I didn’t cough, I felt nothing, and I kind of disliked the taste so I just passed it back and went back to dancing.


However, I just wanted to ask if there’s any bad effects that could happen from just the one time. I’m asthmatic and overweight so that is probably the main reason I’m concerned.

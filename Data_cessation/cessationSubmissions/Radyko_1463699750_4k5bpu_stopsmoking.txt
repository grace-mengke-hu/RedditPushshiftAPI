Resetting my flair, for the last time

These things are shit. I enjoyed the very first cigarette I smoked. Then I proceeded to smoke another three. My mouth feels weird. My chest feels weird. My throat feels weird. As if a huge weight was placed on them, and I'm the only one placing that weight on them. I'm done. This must be the last time. Professional drunk rant right here. Good luck to all of you! We can't keep this dirty habit going!

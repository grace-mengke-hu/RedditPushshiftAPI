20 days and I found a pack. Success!

How the hell did I miss a pack of cigs? At some point I bought them and then at some point I forgot about them? How in the hell did I do that? I was chained to them every day, it seems impossible that I'd miss them. 

But I was cleaning out my truck and found an unopened pack under my seat (and I last cleaned about a month ago, so they should be fresh).

I didn't even think about smoking them at first. My first reaction was "Ugh, what?". I then started to think about smoking them, but in a different way. I instantly thought about how the taste would be foreign in my mouth, how the smell would probably make me gag, how I didn't want any clothes to soak that smell up...

... and then I promptly tossed them in the bin and kept cleaning out my truck. 

Guys, I have no idea how I've switched this dramatically in my head, but I have. I'm so, so, so happy I have. I pray this never goes away.

I am not a smoker. That pack was trash to me.

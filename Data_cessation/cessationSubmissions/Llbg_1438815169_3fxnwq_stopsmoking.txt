day 3 of no smoking: should I use my e cig?

Hi everyone, this is my third day smoke free! I feel a lot better than yesterday, but I still have massive headaches and difficulty focusing. I am a 23 female who has smoked almost a pack a day for 4 years. I am hoping to quit once and for all, but I can't stand this lack of focus I have when I have so much work to get done (I'm a full time student and a writer). I don't want to have the addiction of an e cig, but I'm thinking that might be what I have to do to keep from smoking. pros/cons for e cigs when quitting smoking?

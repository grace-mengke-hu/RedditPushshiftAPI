Feels easier this time

I tried to quit last year, using the new years resolution cliche.  I actually made it a few weeks, but ran into some life problems, and ended right back up at a pack/day.  

This year, I'm determined to make it work.  The really strange thing is, a week and a half into the year, smoke free....it's feeling 10x easier than last year.  I'm not letting my guard down though.  In fact, I signed up for a badge on here, to serve as a reminder, and to keep one more layer of motivation on me to stay smoke free.

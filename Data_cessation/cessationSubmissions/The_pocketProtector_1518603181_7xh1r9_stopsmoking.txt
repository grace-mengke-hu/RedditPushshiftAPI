Today is the day! It's happening!

Hi everyone!

I have decided that today is the day I quit smoking. Just as Joel Spitzer says, it's all about making and sticking to a personal commitment to NEVER TAKE ANOTHER PUFF!

I've wanted this for years, and it's now so clear to me. Relapsing happens by taking another puff, so I will never do it again! I will never have to, and neither will you!

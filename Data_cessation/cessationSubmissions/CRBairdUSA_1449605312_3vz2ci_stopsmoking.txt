Advise me please: traveling home and quitting

Hi everyone. I've been a smoker for approximately 10 years and I am traveling back home to live and work with my father (an ex-smoker) for 6 weeks. This seems like a perfect time to detox and change. I'm flying in 10 days. Please, any advice no matter how direct or uncomfortable is appreciated. 

I need the help and I am grateful for any.

Day 4 of dropping the habit...

I've made the decision yet again to quit smoking. I'm only 23 and I've been smoking for right about 10 years now. When I started smoking it was only a few here and there a day until the last 5 years where it basically became about a pack a day.. I feel like now is the perfect time to quit because I am still young. My brother, dad, and I have all decided to quit on new years together but that didn't work out since I caught my dad and brother smoking on day 2.. I am on day 4 of quitting and I am hoping to get some tips and/or support with this. I really want to kill the craving and get back to normal.

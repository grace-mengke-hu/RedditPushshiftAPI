6 days and still going strong

Atm I have been smoke free for 6 days. And it is awesome!
By the way I am 17 years old (18 soon), Smoked for 2,5 years now.. I wished I never started, especially this young. 

But I got no cravings anymore. Today at school (I am sick so I need some fresh air) I went out with my friends whom smoke. But I didnt!! And I didnt feel like I wanted at all.

Any tips how to keep it going? aka. I know it will hold, some tips would just be nice.

Sincerely Esben

Day 3 Reflections

Day 3 - one of the hardest for me.  But it's amazing the quick changes taking place after 35-40 years of smoking.  This morning, I smelled the coffee brewing from another room.  I am coughing more, but feels like a healthy, lung-clearing cough.  Met a smoker on my way to a meeting and felt no longing for a cig - only pity for him!  I feel happy today.  Good luck to all, no matter where you are in your journey!

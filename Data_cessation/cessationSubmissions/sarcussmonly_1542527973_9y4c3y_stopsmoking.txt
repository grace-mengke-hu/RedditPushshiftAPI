Help please! ðŸ˜Š

Hello guys, I'm a college student 20 yrs old. I've been smoking for the last 3-4 years but recently from late 2017 to early 2018 I used to smoke 3-4 cigarettes a day, sometimes more but now for the last 2 months I've tried to control a lot and the amount has been reduced to 3-4 cigs a week. The thing is that I don't want to smoke anymore but the cravings are just so hard to get rid off. Whenever I'm stressed about anything it makes me feel like I wanna smoke but I've been trying to not do that. I only smoke one cig in 2-3 days now, and just need your suggestions on how to completely get rid of this habit.

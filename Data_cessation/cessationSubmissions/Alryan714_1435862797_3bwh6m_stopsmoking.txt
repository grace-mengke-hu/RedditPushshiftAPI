Day 17 rant

The last 24 hours has been so hard. I even got offered a smoke because the clear stress I was dealing with.  I said no. But I just hope I can continue to say no. I am fighting with my in laws. My father in law can be childish at times and I recently make the choice not no respond when his anger was over the top.  He in turned called me thin skinned and cowardly.  I am trying to be more peaceful.  I would talk to him if he was more calm, did not cuss me out and disrespect me and my whole family. I at the moment will just keep to myself. I will in no way keep my husband and child away from them. I just want to keep my self from stress. I know smoking won't do anything to change this but god do I want to. The stress makes it so easy to fail. Sorry for the rant.

Help me Stop please

Title of post, I smoke 2 or 3 cigs when stressed and during finals and thesis defence I smoked a pack every 3 days.

I've stopped cold turkey for a month and then a hard test made me pick it up again.

I smoke marijuana daily and I think it feeds into it. I'll get high and unwind during finals smoking 5 cigs in 3 hours.

I'm a motivated person and daily weightliftwr, what are your best tricks and advice. 

Thanks

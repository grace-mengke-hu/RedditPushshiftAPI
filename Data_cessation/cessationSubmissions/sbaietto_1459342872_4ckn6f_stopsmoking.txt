24 hours in

Last night I passed the 24 hour mark. It wasn't as bad as my previous attempts to quit. My children are ill with the flu so I'm staying home from work. I was able to eat and sleep more than if I was at work which I think helped. Plus they keep my busy when they're sick: fetching them water, food, and medicine. My littlest one is excited that I haven't smoked. I really don't want to let her down again. I know that I have to do this for me though. I want this, I'm sick of smoking! I'm strapping in. I know days 3-4 are the worst. Here we go!

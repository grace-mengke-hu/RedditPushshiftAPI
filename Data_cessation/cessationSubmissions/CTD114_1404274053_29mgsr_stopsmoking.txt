If you read Allen Carr and had a hard time...

Try Neil Casey Nicotine Trick. I read Allen Carr and although it made me want to stop, I was still terrified and had a rough time for months. 

This book is completely different and it really helped me so I thought I would let you guys know about it. If you want to stop but are afraid, this book can help you not feel so afraid of stopping anymore.

Guys, I can't control myself and I am getting sick of this.

I feel like crap all the time. I can't stop buying packs. I finish one and I feel disgusted by it, I tell myself that I am not going to have another, I am going just finish the pack or something.....I just keep doing it. I just had another after telling myself 20mins prior that I would stop. I'm shaking and feel very hot, I'm freaking out because I don't have control and I am slowly killing myself. What can I do help me calm the fuck out and get into a headset of quitting again?

I quit for 18days over the summer and I felt a million times better, then the first hint of stress comes along from work, I started the e-cigs, then that just made me crave again, as soon as I was offered a cig from a colleague...I accepted without hesitation.

Guys, teach me how to help myself. Please.

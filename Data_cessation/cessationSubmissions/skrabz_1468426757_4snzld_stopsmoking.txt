Tonight I'm smoking my last cig (hopefully)

Hello dear people of /r/stopsmoking

22-yo french guy here. I've been smoking for roughly 1.5~2 years now. Had ups & downs but right now my daily cigarette consumption is sitting at something like 6 cigs/day. Can't even remember why I started in the first place, but I sure know why I want to quit now : to stop feeling like shit every morning when I wake up, to not have to catch breath after every stairs, to be able to taste & smell things like I should be able to...
Anyway it's a bit more than 6 PM here, and by the time I go to bed I'll have smoked my last cig. Also next monday I'll be starting the Couch to 5K running program to try and get in an even better shape !
I wanted to thanks you all guys already, reading stuff that gets posted here played its part in that decision-making. If anyone is interested I would gladly report on my progress :)

For those who are struggling, hang in there ! I feel like just making that decision required some serious willpower (at least for me), even though I probably won't say the same after my first cravings haha
And for those who are lurking -and still smoking- like I used to, let's all stop together :D

Day 2...

I'm not sure what else to say besides a big thank you to all of you who share stories and comment, do a little venting, and ask for some advice. So here we go. 

All of you you who share your stories, or news articles and graphs or give any sort of advice in the comments: you guys kept the thought of a way out in my head while I was still smoking. I'd go out to have a smoke, pop open reddit on my phone and I'd always see this sub pop up. So thank you guys for keeping a seat warm for me here. 

I've gotta say that I haven't felt this bad in a long time, physically. It's probably my body flushing all the poison out, but man do I hurt in all sorts of ways. I'm restless and irritated and I can't stay concentrated. My muscles all feel contracted and I feel like I'm going to burst out of my skin. But I know that this is going to pass and that I can't give up now. Going back to a pack and a half a day is the last thing I want to do. For my health and my attractiveness to others and for my wallet, I know that what I'm doing now is right. 

I'm withdrawing hard. I've quit before and it has never been this painful and hard mentally and physically. Does anyone have any advice for me on how to make this go as smooth as possible? I'm trying to snack throughout the day and stay busy but I was wondering if there was more?

Again, thank you all so much. You guys are awesome.

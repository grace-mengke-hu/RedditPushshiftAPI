Perhaps not one to be proud of

On Saturday I turned 24 and after 6 months of trying to stop, I stopped at 22:29 GMT on Sunday night (you gotta continue the birthday weekend and evening pints) after cutting down from 20 to about 7 a day. Everything was great till last night (about 21:00) after 3 three days quit life was gravy. Then I rolled a cig, instantly everything went tits up, the night was no longer fun (in the space of about 20 seconds). Laughter turned to looking at ones shoes. And I shall restart on this lovely weekend. Look forward to it. Fuck looking at shoes.

42 days in, why is my brain dumb and anxious still?

Title. 24 y/ male, smoking for 10 years
Anyway, it's like a big ball of anxiety in my chest and it's been there since I quit, like on and off again. I have panic attacks before going to class at uni. I'm trying to make friends but don't know how.

Plus my ADHD is back in full force. Luckily I have a light semester but I actually want to start fixing my life so I need to have organizational skills!

depressed, moody, anxious, crazy, too much energy, no focus or concentration

I thought the withdrawal was only 3 days?

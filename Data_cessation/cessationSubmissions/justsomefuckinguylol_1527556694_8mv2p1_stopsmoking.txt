Eleven Days: What to Expect?

Hey folks, posted 6 days back about being on day 5. Still running, still smoke free. 11 days in and cravings aren't an issue (sometimes my brain seemingly defaults on a cig being next after coffee in the car, but it's not hard to stifle that habitual response).

I'm literally getting anxious waiting for my lungs to start cleaning themselves out, I'm worried how much it's gonna suck (but obviously the reward is way worth it). I thought I'd be feeling it now, though?

I was wondering, is there any solid resource on what to expect on the path to recovery? Cravings are gone, weren't much to begin with - but I did have this weird-ass side effect of insanely profound dreams (Very similar to when I stopped smoking weed awhile back). I'd love a list of shit most people don't mention. Or big hurdles so someone knows what to expect. I will say I feel like my mouth is way more dry and the back of my mouth, as it goes into my throat, feels like I'm almost losing my voice - but no hacking up or coughing. 

Any other weird symptoms? I'm really happy I somehow missed the farting haha.

Allen Carr doesn't work for me. Need help.

I know that Allen Carr's Easy way to Stop Smoking has helped a lot of people. But the book simply doesn't work for me. All the things he says, I already know and realize to be true. I don't enjoy smoking, it does nothing for me. I know I am addicted.
All that being said, withdrawal symptoms are a pain in the ass. I can't brush that aside.
I have quit a few times, never more than a week or two and then gotten back to smoking with a vengeance. The withdrawal is just too much to carry on life as usual. I have a pretty stressful job and I usually manage to do quite well. On days when I am attempting to quit, I can't manage to keep my temper in check. I snap at small things and am unusually pessimistic and spread that negativity. I am a manager with around ten people in my team in an organization that is not employee friendly. People like and respect me. But when I am off smokes, I am complaining and criticizing all the time.
I try to quit and always fail. It has gotten so bad that quitting is all I think about while smoking all of the time.
I get addicted quite easily and have had extended periods of depression.. 
I was addicted to weed since 2008 which I have managed to quit altogether.. Almost an year now.. 
I also have a drinking problem which I have somehow managed to control.. Still drink but not half as frequently.. Used to drink 3-4 beers every day for past 6 years..

I work extremely hard at my job and everyone likes me and appreciates my effort.
But my personal life and health is a mess..
My wife moved to another city in 2015 as she couldn't cope with my depression and addiction. . Things are better now and we do manage to get by. I am 33..Alone and fighting.. 
Seems like a rant by this time.
Need help and suggestions..

TLDR - Allen Carr's easy way doesn't work for me. Desperate to quit and stay quit. Have an addictive personality. Need help.

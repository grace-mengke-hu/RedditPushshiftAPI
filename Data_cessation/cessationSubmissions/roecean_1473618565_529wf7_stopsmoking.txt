Been waiting for this day for so long...

I didn't want to jump the gun & say anything too quickly, but I am officially 27.5 hours since my last cigarette.
I was originally intending to use Zonnic 4mg cinnamon nicotine gum. I used two pieces early yesterday then got tired of it & haven't had any since. 

I know this is just the beginning of a long road, but I feel confident. More confident than I ever have. & somehow, this is the easiest quit attempt I have made yet.

Thank you for the inspiration!

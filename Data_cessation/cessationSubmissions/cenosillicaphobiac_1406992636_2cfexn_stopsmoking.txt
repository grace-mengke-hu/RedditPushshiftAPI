About to go camping

I'm heading up camping in about an hour.  I am already feeling the pangs of withdrawal.  Fortunately those don't make me want to smoke, they only make me wish they would just go away.  

None of the people I'm camping with smoke, which is a bonus.  Plus I'm fully aware (having been there) that a relapse will cause me multiple days of displeasure, so that's not really going to happen.  It's good to face these triggers in an environment like this, where I'm with family that supports me and is invested in my quit.

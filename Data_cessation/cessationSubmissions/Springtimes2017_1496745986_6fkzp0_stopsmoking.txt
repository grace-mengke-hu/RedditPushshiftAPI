Birthday treat - 52 days smoke free!

Hi all,

Yesterday was my birthday and I rewarded myself by getting through it and now i am 52 days smoke free!

The money Ive been saving meant I could go for afternoon tea with my daughter and enjoy the day without having to leave her at any moment in order to smoke.

Im really grateful to this thread and to the smoke free app that I use.  

For those of you who are just starting as non smokers or new in - keep going. Ive not long been where you are and it does get easier to say no to any cravings.  I have also seen that for those who have been non smokers longer they also have to remember they can never just have one or they will more thab likely end of having another pack and be on it in no time at all.

I truly believe that once we choose to let go we can and dont get me wrong ive has near misses or times when  felt i needed a cig but this board has been a huge help.

Long may it continue!!

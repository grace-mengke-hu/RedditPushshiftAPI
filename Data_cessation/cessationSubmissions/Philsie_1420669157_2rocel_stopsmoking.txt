Coming up on 3 years!

Cold turkey, its the only way for me!  I also used the rule of 2s.  When craving hits, watch a clock.   When 2 minutes has passed, so has your craving. 2 weeks.  First 2 weeks are going to suck.  Make it through 2 weeks, you're over the hump!  2 months.  Make it through 2 months,  and you're now a former smoker!

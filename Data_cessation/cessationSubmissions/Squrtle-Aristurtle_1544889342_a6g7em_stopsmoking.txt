10 days, guys.

 I know its just a small victory, but to me it's huge. I quit for a year before, got drunk at the Christmas party 2017 and had my first cigarette back. Been smoking strong since that Christmas party. I gotta quit. For my kid. I'm gonna die if don't. And not the easy, quick kind of death, the slow coughing, suffocating through an oxygen mask kind of death. Capital F FFFFFUUUCK THAT! I choose life, boys. Being without a cigarette makes me panicky, but that's the real panic, actually having one.

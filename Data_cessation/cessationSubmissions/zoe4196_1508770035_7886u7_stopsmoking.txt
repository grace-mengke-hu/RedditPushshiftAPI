Day 6

It's been 6 1/2 days, I made it through the weekend and through a few drinks. I feel so much better not smoking. I have a ton of energy as opposed to feeling lethargic all the time! I feel like I am a nicer person to be around and I smile so much more now and feel like I am actually enjoying life. I wish someone had told me that my negative moods and lack of energy were from smoking. I thought the cigarettes were keeping me from losing my mind but in reality they were making me lose my shit all the time. Fingers crossed that this continues. The hubby quit smoking last night so I hope together we can do this!

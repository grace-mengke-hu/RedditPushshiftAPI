Drawing a blank

Guys I need advice. I quit smoking 5 days ago and although it has been a smooth journey so Far, there are times when I just draw a blank. I cant remember names or can't focus. I can't believe the damage nicotine has done to me. But I was just wondering if anyone of you faced this and what did u guys do?

Day 1.. and Day 177.

Today I threw out what will be the last packet of smoke I will ever buy. 177 days ago was my last drink and I'm so happy and thankful for that and for /r/stopdrinking. Now I plan to do the same here and continue hitting my goals and fitness. Thanks all for being here and supporting everyone.

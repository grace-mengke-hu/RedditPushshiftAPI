The Smoking Habits Of My Friends Annoy Me

[I quit smoking](https://reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/7jlaph/how_i_quit_with_lsd_a_book/) over a year ago. I don‘t really crave cigarettes at all anymore. But what hasn‘t faded is some weird kind of light resentment towards my friends when they smoke (Literally all of them do).

It partly feels like a kind of jealousy, as if I‘m missing out on something. I know that I did the right thing but since I‘m the only one who did I feel kind of lonely.

Of course it also smells disgusting and their addiction patterns are so obvious.

Anyone else feel this way?

Today is the day.

(Sorry for the incoherent rant you are about to read, someone told me this may help) That's it. I've had it. I've been trying to quit for the last 4 months always telling  myself "just have one to stop the cravings". Not anymore. I'm putting my vape away, I'm not having anymore cigarettes. It has controlled my life for too long. The fact that I have bad health anxiety doesn't help. I'm sick of always being worried something is wrong. I'm sick of telling myself day in and day out that I can quit anytime and never doing anything about. I'm done. These stupid sticks will never have a hold on me again. I. Can. Do this.

Day 1 of giving up nerves

So today is day one of giving up smoking, I’ve been smoking for around 7 years now since my brother passed away. I’ve not struggled too ,much so far but I’m due to start night shifts tonight and smoking is a big part of the culture in work, particularly on nights. Does anyone have any advice of how to remain strong?

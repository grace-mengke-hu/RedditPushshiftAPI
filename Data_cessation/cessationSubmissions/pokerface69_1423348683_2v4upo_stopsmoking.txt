Alcohol Weed and Music Fest

So I've been having these major craving attacks not more than once a day now. 
I've been sober for around 10ish days

I always seem to think about those posts where ppl used to feel proud when they successfully not smoke in a bar/while drinking. 

I guess today is that proud day for me. 

I got so bombed and with a few glasses of wine I was craving so baaaaad , seeing almost everyone smoking. 

what got me thru today was the little concious mind voice saying it's not worth it.

Stopping on hard mode

I’ve been smoking for around 3 years, luckily not too long to start a new path without the cigarette.

Last time I stopped was for 2 months but after going to St Tropez to meet a two friends who opened their bar, I started smoking again. Smoking has always been a social thing for me. It’s more of a habit then a rush for nicotine. I’m working in the Hospitality industry and with all the stress, you need a break from time to time. Unfortunately, if you are not a smoker, there is no reason for you to take a break of “fresh air”. So the habit creates itself day and day.

I’m on my 5th day of not smoking anymore. Quit cold turkey. But the reason I called this post stopping on hard mode is because I’m actually working in an Asian country. And whoever has been in Asia before knows that smoking is just too easy. A pack of cigarettes goes from 7€ to 1€ (I'm from France). Before you had the pressure of having to go outside to go smoke, now you can smoke pretty much anywhere freely.

But I feel strong enough to keep on going and to kick this shitty habit and this shitty drug. Keep strong guys and I will do also. Fighting all along together even though we don’t know each other makes me want to work hard and make you guys proud. I am doing it for myself of course, but being in this together creates a bond between each other that forces me to not disappoint you guys. If I had never wrote this post and would have no obligations towards anybody except myself, but creating this link between each other makes me want to do more and to prove wrong to anybody who ever doubt I could stop.

I just hit my juul for the last night. Any tips on quitting?

The biggest regret of my life is taking that first hit of cigarette in high school and today, I decided it's about time I stop this ridiculous habit and try and go back to nicotine free version of myself.  I've been noticing that I need nicotine to feel normal and I fear this habit might get back at me when I get older.  

I already feel my body tingling and getting anxious and it's kinda scaring tf out of me.  Wish me luck!

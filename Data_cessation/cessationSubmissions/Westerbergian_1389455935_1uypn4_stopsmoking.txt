5 Days In... My Rant.

Well, according to my nifty app it's been 5 days and 9 hours since I quit smoking. Honestly, it's been going fairly well, better than I thought it would, but there's one thing that really bothers me.

I have to get past this feeling that I'm missing out!! That's what always gets me (this is quit #5 or so). I am not missing out on anything. I'm not inhaling shit and chemicals, I'm not increasing my chance of cancer and scores of other terrible things, I'm not making myself stinky, I'm not wasting money anymore like I have for the last 16 years. I am not weaker than nicotine and this filthy habit. 

Also, in a bizarre twist, I've found something that helps me with the crazings. Death metal. The darker and more evil, the better. I would consider myself a huge music nerd, but I've never really explored this genre until now. It's like my mind can't process the nicotine craving AND the intense metal at the same time, so the craving is over-ridden. 

That's my rant. Thanks for "listening". Stay strong folks. We can do this. We are better than this.

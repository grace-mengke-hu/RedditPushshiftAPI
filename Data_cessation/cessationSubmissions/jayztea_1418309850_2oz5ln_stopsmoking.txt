Another attempt, for a hopeful quitter.

My last attempt at quitting failed.  But this time is going a little smoother.  I made it through my first weekend and with alcohol in my system.  If I can make it till after Christmas then I'm home free.  I'm going away with my family for 10 days and 100% will not smoke.

Anyways I just wanted to update where I am.  I have a few more hurtles left, but they aren't too high for me to jump over.

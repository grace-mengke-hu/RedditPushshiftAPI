I relapsed today.

I guess I oughta go reset my timer. I was out with friends last night and one asked that I bring cigarettes. She had been going through a really tough time and I said that I would. I had intended on just giving them all to her and forgetting about it. She was late arriving to see me, so I smoke one, then two, then three. I'm back at it again. 

I feel like shit.

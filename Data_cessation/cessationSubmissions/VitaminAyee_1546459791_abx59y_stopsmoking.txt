Desperate to quit and looking for support

Hey all!  


Trying to make a commitment to quitting! I'm 22 now and have been smoking since I was 14. There have been good years and bad years but I'm making this promise to myself and my SO.   


Health has been going down the drain and I'm determined to change that!   


What are some apps, communities, resources that you guys can recommend? Would switching over to patches or gum help for now?  


I had my 'last' cigarette without deciding that was my last and I think that's for the better!

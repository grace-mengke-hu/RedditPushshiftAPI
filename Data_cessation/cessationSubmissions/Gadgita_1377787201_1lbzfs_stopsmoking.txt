Relapsed - Need some insight on re-quitting...

Disclaimer: My flair is a lie and I haven't had it reset yet. 

Now that's out of the way, I quit for the first time Jan 13th of this year. Did fantastic before relapsing in the middle of the night when I found out about some medical problems I have and plainly flipped the F out. (<--- excuse, I know) 
Anyway, this was Jul 13th that I began smoking again and I can't bring myself to unsub from this subreddit - you guys give me some sort of glimpse into quitting again and being smoke free again. Unfortunately, when I quit in Jan the medical problems I was unaware of were already taking it's toll. I felt WORSE (way worse) after I quit smoking so I don't even have the drive to "feel as good as I did when I wasn't smoking". 

**What** does it feel like to quit smoking WHILE you're healthy? Breathing problems in particular and activity level/ability? Not particularly fishing for reasons to quit just curious...

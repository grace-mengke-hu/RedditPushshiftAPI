Crazy dreams!

I had a dream last night I was on vacation in Mexico and I started smoking again, and by the time  I remembered that I wasn't a smoker any more  I had already bought like a suitcase full of cigarettes... I woke up in a panic, then had a huge sigh of relief when I realized it was a dream. 

Do any of you have crazy dreams like this?

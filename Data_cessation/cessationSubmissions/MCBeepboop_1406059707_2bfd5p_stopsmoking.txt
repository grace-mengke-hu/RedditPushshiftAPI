I threw my cigarettes in the trash.

I posted a few days ago about feeling weak and discouraged. That same day, you lovely folks offered me stern and caring words of support. I threw that pack in the trash (this is the first time I didn't just pass a pack off to a friend- they actually went in the trash where they belong!), and I've been cigarette free for three days now! 

THANKS!

Stopped smoking, still feel like shit.

About 2 months ago I quit smoking cigarettes with the help of an e-cig. I was a pack a day smoke and chainsmoker when drinking and was spending way to much money on smokes. Now I've quit and feel no desire to buy a pack but I feel like I want to, not because of nicotine but because I feel no different from quitting smoking. I still get brownish phlem that I used to get when i would smoke like crazy. My lungs don't feel better and I get the same chest pains I used to get every once in a while. I barley use the e-cig compared to how I used to smoke cigarettes. Is there some better feeling that's supposed to come or is this it?

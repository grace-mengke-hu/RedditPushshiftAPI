Day one, one of who knows how many Day ones.

I decided to quit smoking, again. I picked it up when I was 14 and I've been quitting ever since. 

This is a pretty great time to quit, though. I'm 23, back at home for a semester, just ended it with a girl because we wanted different things, and I'm back working FOH restaurant stuff again. Those are either great reasons to quit or great reasons to start. All I know is that today is going to be the first day in a long time that I get to work not smelling like I had a cigarette on the way there. Who knows, maybe when I get home I'll go on the first bike ride in who knows how long?

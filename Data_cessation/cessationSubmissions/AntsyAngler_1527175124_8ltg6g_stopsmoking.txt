Day 15. Wicked cravings this morning.

I'm just posting this as a reminder to myself to stay vigilant.  I'm not out of the woods.  I can hardly even tell in which direction "out of the woods" is located.  

But I'm not going to cave in.  I can make it through another day without smoking.  These craving will pass.  They've already faded from a roar to a shout, and eventually they'll be a quiet hum, easily ignored.  

I felt a craving as I went in to clean the kitchen, left messy yet again by my family.  I felt a craving as I thought about if I should get a divorce.  I felt a craving as I worried about house payments, medical bills, full time employment.  I just washed the dishes and started laundry instead.

I can smell cigarettes out in the garden. It may be a trick of the mind.  Being in my garden is a trigger, unfortunately.  I smoked while I watered my vegetables and flowers.  I smoked while I did so many things.  Now I'm learning to do them without a cigarette.  It just seems so impossible at first.  But then I do it, and it is possible, sometimes it's even enjoyable.  

That's all.  Just posting to get through the craving.

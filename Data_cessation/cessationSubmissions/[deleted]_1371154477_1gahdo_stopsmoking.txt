Effectiveness of E-Cigs

I (very) recently quit smoking. As a crutch, I picked up one of those electronic cigarettes. I was wondering if anyone has personal experience and can tell me about their effectiveness? So far my consensus is that it tastes terrible and isn't anything like the real thing, but that it seems to help to mimic the motion/inhaling and exhaling "smoke." However, I am worried that I'm possibly bolstering my nicotine addiction since I can just sit inside and mindlessly puff. Help? Am I giving myself a good transition or setting myself up for failure?

Almost 2 months without a cigar...

Its been a long journey since i quit and i was thinking that i really don't miss smoking, i don't have cravings, and just thinking about the smell gives me nauseas, if i see someone smoking i don't mind, and the most ridiculous thought that comes to my mind is that i hated my fingers were always yellow and i don't want to go back to smoking because of that!

This is my first time quitting some smokers come to me and say that   stop smoking for me was easy because i smoked for a small time (5 years) but mentally i am starting to hate cigars, is it normal when you stop that you become disgusted?  

I thought i was going to crave for cigars everyday and honestly i had my last craving a month ago...

Thanks (Note: English is not my native language!)

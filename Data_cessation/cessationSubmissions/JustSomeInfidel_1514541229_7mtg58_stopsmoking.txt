[Day 1] Quitting Smoking (rant)

So it's been like 3 hours since my last cigarette and im really irritated, What pissed me off the most is when i asked my mother for this thing that will help me quit smoking (that she herself told me about), she just told me "my mother quit without using anything, don't make excuses for yourself" at this point i felt like fucking smoking again but i decided not to and instead to just drink coffee instead of smoking, also for some reason im starting to take out my anger on myself, i just really hate myself for some reason since im bascilly the family's black sheep as they say, I also have finals and the withdrawal is not helping me with it. i actually feel alot better after writing all this, maybe i should rant more often not sure if this is the right place for it.

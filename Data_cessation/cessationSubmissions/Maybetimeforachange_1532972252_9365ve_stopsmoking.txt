Ugh, starting over again...

I quit smoking last winter using a vape, gradually reducing nicotine to zero.  Thought maybe I didn't need the vape anymore, but I guess I was wrong - I lasted less than a week without it.  Had three cigarettes on Friday night - I'd love to blame the beer but the fault is all mine.  I'm back to vaping, but I went right back to vaping without nicotine.  Almost back to three days without nicotine.  So ashamed...

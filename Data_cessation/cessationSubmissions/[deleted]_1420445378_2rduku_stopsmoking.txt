I really need some help/advice

I know I've made the right decision to quit smoking. It's been 5 days since I stopped. It wasn't for health, it's purely about money. Here in NZ it's now $1 a cigarette and I just can't afford that. 
Both my flatmates and most my good friends smoke and they keep telling me how proud of me they are, one even came up to me today and said that because of how far I've come she's going to quit too. The support has been great but holy shit these withdrawals are going to send me over the edge. 
I know it's not meth addiction so it's not as bad. But still... I can't handle it. 

How did you guys cope with the extreme withdrawals? How did you stay strong?

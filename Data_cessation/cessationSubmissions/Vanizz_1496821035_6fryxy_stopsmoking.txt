Any runners?

So, I'm on day 1 and I've had 1 craving so far and I dealt with it by eating a lot which is something that I want to replace with another thing, many people say gum but I don't know about it, anyway I've been running for the last 6 months while smoking a lot as well but apparently I've reached a point In which my times would just not get better and I believe it's because the cigarettes, there have been times where I don't smoke because of sleep and go to run next day and I run better and with much much better times, how is my progression as I quit going to be on running?

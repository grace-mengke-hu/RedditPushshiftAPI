I literally can't even believe I've quit this long

I just popped in to see all the New year's resolution stuff and realized it's been over a year and a half since my last cigarette :)  I feel so stupid proud!! Reading threads from this subreddit was a major component in helping me quit so hopefully I can pass on just a little motivation to all of you guys just starting out. Good luck to you, this year is your year!

Day 5 and needing support/advice

I started smoking just before my 18th birthday and have recently turned 21, on Monday I quit smoking (last cig was on Sunday) because I just don't want to fall into being a life long smoker, by Wednesday I was twitching out of my skin and caved and went and bought a box of nicotine patches. I still haven't smoked and the nicotine patches helped with the withdraws a lot, my concern is that as long as I'm on the patches the craving to smoke will still be there. Has anyone else used patches to successfully quit?

Edit: I'm also worried about the weekend starting tomorrow because I always spend the weekends with my good friends who are also my next door neighbors and pack-a-day+ smokers. and I am going to a party this weekend where I know there will be a lot of smoking around me

Quit, then got dumped in the middle of exam period.

Ugh. I was doing so well and hadn't smoked for about two weeks, then this happened and I went back out to get a pack. I'm graduating at the end of the month, we'd been together for years, and now my postgrad plans (finding a job in the city where he'd be) are down the drain.

Any tips for making sure this is a temporary blip instead of permanently going back?

6 Months. I'm proud of me.

I'm not sure I expected to make it this long.  This sub was a big help in the beginning. 

I do need to admit to taking 1 (and only 1) puff of a cigar this weekend while white girl wasted.  Honestly I'm relieved to have that puff out of the way.  It was like running into an old friend and immediately realizing that whatever thing we connected on in the past, is long gone.

Test of my fortitude today...

I'm packing up the house so that we can move at the beginning of August.  I came across a pack of cigarettes that had two left in it.  I sat there looking at those two cigarettes for the longest time, the craving burning like fire in my brain.  My mind was whispering, trying like hell to justify just a few puffs...just a few!  I've been so good!  Cold turkey for 6 weeks...

Then, very slowly and deliberately, with my brain screaming bloody murder, I took both of those devil things out of the pack and crushed them into oblivion over the trash can.

Fuck you, nicotine.  I win.

Made it through the day.

Last night I was sure I would be smoking again today, but put it off until this morning and woke up not wanting to smoke. Getting close to 3 months and this was the hardest time yet.

I still need to stop eating so much and get some dedicated exercise, but I feel like I beat the crisis.

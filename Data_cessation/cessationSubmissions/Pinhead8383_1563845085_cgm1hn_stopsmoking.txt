When is a good time to quit?

I'm a serial quitter. Tried e-cigs, gum, patches. Still smoking

I know the obvious answer is 'now'... but I have came to the conclusion after many attempts that I must not be in the right mindset to just quit. What can put me in that mindset? I'm generally really easy going, work isn't stressful and my spare time is enjoyable, so it seems like the perfect recipe to quit. 

I've heard that after a few days of non-smoking that it leaves your system and makes at a good bit easier to quit. Is this true and when is the best time to attempt this?

I'm really motivated right this second but I'm waking up in a few hours for work. Is this a bad time to attempt it since I won't be in my ideal environment? Should I attempt it when I have a few days off? 

This post is a ramble and there is no specific question although hopefully you get an idea of where I am mentally and situationally. I guess I'm requesting someone to pin point exactly where when how what.. all that bollocks.

Thanks in advance.

Quitting Thursday would like people to talk to

I haven't tried to quit for two years. Previously from I'd say 08 to 13 i could every few months try to quit and go a week without smoking three Times I went between 23 to 30 days. I'm flat broke unfit and fat for the first time in my life. My girlfriend is traveling for three weeks so now's the best time to quit for the immediate mood swings. One downside I'm at a ski resort in between seasons and lots of friends are currently not hereto help but Thursday is day one of my new job. Last year out of nowhere I had two panic attacks. I'm afraid that this time quitting might cause them. Anyone have any advice regarding this? I honestly don't think I can quit without a forum like this/ people to talk to. Thanks Reddit ! I'd like any advice to quit you can give me on here or any I.M I just want someone to talk to you when I have a serious urge people who can relate with how stupid the stopping is when all you have to do is not put something in your mouth.

Need help with the quitting smoking thing

Hi all, I'm looking for a little help with quitting smoking, so I'd say I'm in the right place.

Little about me, I'm 34, been smoking since I was 17, and I'm struggling horribly in the process. I need to quit for the following reasons

I can't afford it - in Australia the prices of smoking are ridiculous, about AUD$15-20 per pack, and we'd be struggling even without the smokes

It's killing my health - I'm an asthmatic, and obviously this is the worst thing in the world I can be doing

I have a baby on the way, and I'd kind of like to be there for him/her, and my wife, for a long time to come.

I know that with these reasons I should be giving up the fags, but for some reason I go for a few days, and then I'll have a couple, and I'm back to 20 a day without even realizing it - been trying on and off the last two years, and I still end up back in this horrible spot.

I've struggled with other addictions in the past, drinking, World of Warcraft, and I managed to grit my teeth and get over those, but for some reasons I can't get my head around this. 

Has anyone else been in this situation (I'm assuming that was a silly question), and if so, how do I get past it? Really looking for some help from the community if possible

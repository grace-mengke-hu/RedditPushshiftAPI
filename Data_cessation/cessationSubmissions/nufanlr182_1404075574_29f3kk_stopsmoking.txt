Smoking when drinking

I can easily not smoke a cigarette all work week- I even run and work out at the gym and I feel great. When the weekend rolls around and me and my friends hit the bars, I always crave a cigarette.

Any suggestions on how to stop the craving when drinking? Any tips or tricks?

thanks all.

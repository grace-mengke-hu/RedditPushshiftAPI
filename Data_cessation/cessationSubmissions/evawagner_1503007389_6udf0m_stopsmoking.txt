Day 19 - What strategies have worked for me:


- Working out in the morning helps me to want to stay healthy for the rest of the day!
- Not drinking any alcohol is key! And a double win! I'm do not want to play with fire.
- Eating healthy, clean and organic makes me feel like I'm cleaning my body on the inside. Would not want to make it dirty with smoke!
- Staying away from typical smoking events, such as drinking coffee outside with girlfriends.  Now we do errands together instead, and take a coffee inside where you're not allowd to smoke.

What strategies have worked for you the first weeks/month?

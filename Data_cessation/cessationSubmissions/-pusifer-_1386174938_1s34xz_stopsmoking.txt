Got sick, quit smoking, what is going on with me?

OK, so I quit a week ago Monday, then slipped and had a couple when i was drinking (read wasted) on Friday and havent had any others since..  that being said:

I want to *KILL* everyone.  I don't even like my dog right now.

What is all of this stuff I'm coughing up??  Will it ever end?

Seriously, I hate everyone, including myself.  This is bullshit. 

How long does this last??  

Sincerly, 
On my pitty pot

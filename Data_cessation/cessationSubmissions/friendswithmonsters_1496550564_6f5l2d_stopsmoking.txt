Boyfriend has been smoke free for 2 weeks! Any tips on what I can do to keep him motivated? His friends and coworkers all smoke and I honestly still worry.

He was a 10 cigarettes/day before he quit. Smoked for 5 years.

He mentioned 3 days ago that he really wanted a smoke because work was stressful and his coworkers were smoking, but he stopped himself. He then told me not to worry and that he won't smoke because there are no cravings?

What are his feelings right now? Should I ask him or bring it up at all? Any other difficult checkpoints coming up?

Thanks all! I'm super proud of him and I want him to keep it up!

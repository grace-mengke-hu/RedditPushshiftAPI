Dilemma

I'm sorry if this seems like a frivolous dilemma, but I was wondering if anyone had any advice.

I live with a smoker who leaves his tobacco lying around - and he's quite happy for me to help myself to it. When I told him that I wanted to quit, I requested that he at least stopped leaving it around the house, so the temptation wasn't there. He obliged.

But, there's still always tobacco in the house; whether it's in his room, where he's "hiding" it from me, or in his car. I'm having such difficulty quitting when it's just there in front of me - all the time. He knows when I've taken some, and, like always, doesn't mind. He'll laugh and say something like "struggling, aren't you?"

Does anyone else quitting live with a smoker? How are you getting on? Any tips on resisting something that's right in front of you most of the day?

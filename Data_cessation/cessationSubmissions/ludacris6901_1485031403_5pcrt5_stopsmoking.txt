Just checking in

Just wanted to post so i had someone to "talk" to. Ive been feeling really good about this quit. Going way better than any previous attempt. Cold Turkey this time too but now a week in, my brain is trying to play tricks on me telling me its ok to smoke one since i know i can quit. (Stupidest logic ever). 

Not one more puff, no matter what.  Deep breaths...

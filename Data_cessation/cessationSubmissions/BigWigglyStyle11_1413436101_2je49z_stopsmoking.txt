I made a mistake this weekend

I got drunk with some friends that were visiting and ended up smoking some puffs off my friends cigarettes, and I had a cigar. I don't really count the cigar, but it feel really terrible about the cigs. I convinced myself that if I didn't have my own cigarette I was good. That was 3 days ago and I'm still clean other than that mistake. Do I have to reset my flair? I don't feel like I relapsed as much as I had a momentary lapse in judgement, but I still feel like I failed.

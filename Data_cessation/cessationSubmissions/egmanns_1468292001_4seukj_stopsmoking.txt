I need to stop smoking so bad but feel like im doing circles...please help

Sorry if this sounds selfish i am just struggling so badly. I have anxiety and feel like cigarettes increase it to the point where honestly i don't want to live anymore and am considering....actually best not say that :)

I have listened to alan carr and it makes sense yet i still can't stop and feel like the biggest loser. It feels like im hyper all the time and very depressed.

I apologize if i sound like a whiner or child its just i am at rock bottom.

Alan carr is against NRT but id like to ask if anyone recommendeds them and any other advise. Thankyou so much.

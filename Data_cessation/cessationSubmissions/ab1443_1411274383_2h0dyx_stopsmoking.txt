9 days in...

I'm 20, been smoking since I was 17. I went from 2 a day to 5 a day to 10 a day... and a whole pack in a night if I was drinking heavily. 
I decided to quit because I've been exercising, trying to get in shape and keep my anxiety and depression in check. I'm running a 5k next month and I do yoga every day.
I'm already seeing benefits (no shortness of breath!) but quitting has not been hard. Is it supposed to be hard right now? This is my first (only) time quitting and I'm not sure what to expect.
Also, if anyone has tips on dealing with anxiety in a healthier way, please help!

Hi, I have smoked cigarettes about every day since 2007. I bought a vaporizer and while it does not replace the sensation of smoking cigarettes all together, it resembles it and may be less harmful. Today will be my first day quitting cigarettes this year. I will post, I am also going to eat carrots

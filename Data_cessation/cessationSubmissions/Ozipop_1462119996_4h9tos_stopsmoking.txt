Feel like a failure, Willing but seemingly incapable of trying again.

I quit for 6 months and then my quit went up in smoke. It's been 2.5 months since then. I am smoking more than ever. I feel like there is no way I could possibly quit, even though I have been through this before. I guess I am looking for some motivation, but mostly I want to send a shout out to those of you who are still quit with a lot of time, STAY QUIT. It was far easier to not smoke than it is to quit.

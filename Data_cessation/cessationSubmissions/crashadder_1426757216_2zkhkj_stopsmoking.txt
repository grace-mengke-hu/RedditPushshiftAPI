120 days

woow. i thought i still had few days to the 4 months milestone. this has come as a good surprise. looking back the journey has been relatively easy. one of the main reason for that is definitely this sub and realizing that you dont miss anything at all. I caught my wife smoking the other day. She was quit for almost 2 months. The first stressful event she encountered caused her to relapse. The sole reason is the fact that she has no idea how this addiction works. She believes willpower alone is all she needs. This unfortunate event proved once again that knowledge is the greatest power and i am following the best path to my own "journey to home"

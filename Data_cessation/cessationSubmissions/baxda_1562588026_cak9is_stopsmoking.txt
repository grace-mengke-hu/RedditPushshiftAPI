Goodbye Ciggies

Been smoking for 7 years and have been on/off the past year. Quit yesterday only to relapse this morning and buy a fresh pack. Smoked 2 out of the pack and didn't enjoy them at all, having my final one now then throwing away the rest of the pack despite it being a huge waste of money (Waste of money either way). Wish me a luck over the next few days as the thought of smoking will become ever more desirable. Keen to hear what helped others get over the initial hump ?

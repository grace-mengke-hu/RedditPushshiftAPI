500 days. Feel like a completely new person. Smoked a pack a day or more for 8 years. Quitting was one of the best decisions I ever made.

Feels so good. Just got done doing P90X3 for the day. Used to get an elevated heart rate and take deep breaths from going up stairs.

At this  point cigs and smokers smell horrible to me. Every once in a while when I am super stressed, I think I could use a cig. Then I remember that smoking wouldn't do a damn bit of good. Keep up the good work everyone. Breathe in that good clean air.

The longest I've ever gone and I feel great!

It has now been 5/6 days since my last smoke and I feel fantastic! I already have more energy and I feel healthier. The only thing that isn't so great is that I'm having problems sleeping due to fidgeting but I can cope with that!


Just wanted to share, I'm so so happy. I never thought I could stop, but this time I know that this is it!

Some advice would be appreciated.

Hey guys,
My girlfriend stopped smoking about a month ago, switching to a vape. She had smoked for about 8 years preceding that. A week or so ago, she relapsed and I've found her smoking once or twice after that. Since then, she comes home smelling like smoke, but she tells me she isn't. It hurts that she's lying but I don't wanna keep calling her out, since I know that won't help.  It's just eating me up inside. I don't wanna watch her fall back into smoking but I also don't wanna come off as controlling. I'm just concerned about her health. I've also never been a smoker myself, so that may be part of my ignorance here, but what would you guys suggest? Is there something I could possibly do to constructively help or should I just let it be?

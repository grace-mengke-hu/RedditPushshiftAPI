I smoked my (hopefully) last cigarette a couple of minutes ago and I’m freaking out... any advice? Please help!

So like I said in the title I smoked my last cigarette and my heart is racing and I’m shaking and I feel like I can’t breath. I smoked about 12 cigarettes today which is more then normal. That said last summer I’d smoke 20-25 a day. So could I be reacting to the extra nicotine? Or am I just freaking out at the thought of quitting? I’m not sure what’s going on with my body right now but this shit ain’t fun. Any advice?

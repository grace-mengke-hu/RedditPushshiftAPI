Afraid of relapse

Hello All,

Just wanted to check in for some support/accountability. Been somewhat stressed lately; finances, school, work, usual adult nonsense basically. Been without my Welbutrin for about a week now which I think is having an effect as well. Hoping to be all back on track in that regard by next week.

I've noticed smokers a lot more lately, and instead of my usual revulsion (to the cigs/smell, not the people) I've found myself craving cigarettes again, toying with the idea of keeping a pack in the car or closet or something.

The better half of me knows I don't need it and the fleeting gratification from a cigarette will quickly be quashed by my shame of breaking my [longest to date] 9 month streak; but the other, ADHD-addled part of me says fuck that, get that instant gratification!

Beat some sense into me, /r/stopsmoking!

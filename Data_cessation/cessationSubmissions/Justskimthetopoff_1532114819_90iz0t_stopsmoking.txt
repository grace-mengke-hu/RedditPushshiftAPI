Pavlov type of addiction to cigarettes - thoughts?

Hi, thanks for reading. 

Day 4 without smoking.  I didn't smoke that much (~1 pack/week at most), but it was extremely influenced by where I was.  For example, I'd never smoke outside of my house, but as soon as I got home, I'd itch for a cigarette.  Has anyone else noticed that it's triggered by a location (Pavlov-esq)?  It's really frustrating because when I'm away or travelling, I don't smoke at all.  But as soon as I lay down on my couch, boom.  I could smoke a whole pack in one evening.

My method of quitting is by having half a beer every time I want a cigarette. 
 

And it's working, I'm not finishing the whole beer (just a few sips/gulps, maybe 2 bottles per night), and it removes the need to do something with my hands/mouth.  
If this fails, I will try and change the arrangement of my living room so I don't feel the same urge to smoke due to the setting.  Any other thoughts on how to quit?  I tried vaping but when it broke I went straight back to cigarettes.

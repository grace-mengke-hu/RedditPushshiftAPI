Day 6

Almost a week under my belt and this end of it seems a lot better than the start. Went for my first run in 1 year and had a solid 3k with intervals. The lungs felt sore but to be able to run without getting light headed was a treat.

It will take a lot of work to get back to where I was 4-5 years ago but I am excited to try. Thanks everyone for your support and best of luck today!

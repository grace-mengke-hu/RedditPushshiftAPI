tough love from an ex smoker

the harsh truth is that your will is weak.  
You are weak.   
the fight to quit is a struggle of the body versus the mind   


your body craves the very thing that is slowly killing it    
but your body can only take so much abuse    


it'll start innocently enough at first  
you'll feel a little out of breath walking up stairs or  
maybe have a little cough once in a while  
but it will get worse  


when it comes down to it  
your body is fighting a battle it will eventually lose  


your body is powerless to your weakness.   
but the thing is   
you dont have to be weak.   


your body needs you to become strong  
will you defend your body?  
will you defend you?  


you might say the gums or the patches aren't working   
but when it comes down to it the only thing that can make you quit is you   
those are only tools to help you   


next time before you light up challenge yourself to postpone it for 5 minutes  
next time postpone it longer  
flex your mind and strengthen your discipline  
the nicotine controls you. it owns you and you need to take your life back.   


sometimes people quit successfully on their 4th or 5th try because they have reached a point where they have   
gained enough mental strength


if you don't think you can be strong enough for you   
then be strong enough for someone who loves you    


it can be scary  
it can be lonely  
it can feel like losing a best friend  
it can make you feel terribly emotional  
any emotions you may have tried to numb with cigarettes in the past will come crashing to the forefront of your   
consciousness


but you will heal  
it will get easier  
and with time you will begin to feel whole again.  



love, 
       an ex-smoker

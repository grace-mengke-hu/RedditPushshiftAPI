Almost done with Day 3 and it was a rough one.

So i am at end of day 3 and this was easily the roughest day for me so far. So many cravings!!! I haven't felt well all day and I am one moody son of a gun. I will not give in and I will stop this disguisting addiction. 23 years is long enough!!

Thank you to all of the people posting on this subreddit. It really does help to hear that it eventually gets better cause this sucks!!!

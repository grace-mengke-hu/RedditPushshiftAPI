Still trying

I am on day 50. It’s all in the mind and mind power to quit. I have had a smoke here and smoke there, a few here n there, then it became 1 a day then 2 a day then 3 a day.

Now I am 48 hours smoke free and I am still going through the same phase as week 1, when I had already got to the point where I could go without and didn’t need that 1 here n there.

My point is, u can not have 1 here n there. People say u can, and some people have told me not to be too hard on myself as I have done so well, however I am still going through the mental mind games with cigarettes. I should be mentally free of them however I am not... they are still controlling my thoughts.  

The first week was maddness. I screamed cried and wished for a smoke... however as each day passed I started to feel amazing. The confidence and love of myself for going 1 day then 2 days then 3 days then 1 week without made me feel like a champion.

It was easy to pin point my triggers.... every 5 min when life stressed me out I would reach for the packet and then realise I didn’t have a packet.... mini anxiety attack for a few seconds which would quickly pass.

Also doing house work was hard because having a smoke was a reward when I would complete it.

Talking on the phone... would be most difficult.... I would always light up when having a good chat.

I am finally over those triggers and am now quitting again without those influences

Food - treat yo self. I’ve indulged significantly. However this is necessary. Then it tapers off.  But lots of different yummy teas, nuts, and fruit perhaps.

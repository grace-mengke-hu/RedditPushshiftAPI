I want to quit, but...

I don't even know where I'd start. I've been smoking for a little over five years now, and I think my biggest regret in my life is buying that first pack. 

I don't smoke much. Typically, it's only at work, though I will have the occasional cigarette at home. I tried to quit cold turkey about two years ago, but after roughly a month, I caved, picked up the habit again, and haven't tried to quit since. I thought that with how little I do smoke (usually takes about three days to get through a pack), it would be easy to quit, but I was wrong. 

I was hoping I could avoid e-cigarettes, but maybe that's the best place to start? If anyone has any advice, I'd really appreciate it. Hopefully, this pack I have now is the last.

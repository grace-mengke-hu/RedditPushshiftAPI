Read about a guy who got throat cancer at 37.

I've been getting a weird feeling in my neck whenever I smoke but I'm 23 and wikipedia says it's impossible for me to get that kind of cancer before the age of 50, well, read the title again. I also read about the comedian who did the AMA who was dying and I now believe that Wikipedia articles pertaining to certain industries aren't to be trusted. Same applies to comments such as "...It looks sexy (when a girl/guy does it)." Not to sound like a conspiratard but corporate shills are a thing.

This is my umpteenth day one, I used to think I couldn't spend the rest of my life without smoking. What if I want to smoke cigars when I'm older, what if I detox for 10 or so years then start up again, how can I quit if I've never smoked after sex. It all seemed like too much to leave behind but now I don't care. It won't be worse than dying young.

Throat cancer is the most common cancer in my country, more common than prostate. As a smoker for 5 years I'm prepared to walk away from that shit and never look back.

Does anyone else's period was messed up when smoking?

When I smoked (not that much, just one cigarette here and there) and it was period time, my bleeding stopped and had transparent excertions from that moment on. Also, my period was delayed a week the next month. These were some of the reasons I quit smoking.

My question is, how common is that? I always had the feeling that I was the only one with those symptoms...

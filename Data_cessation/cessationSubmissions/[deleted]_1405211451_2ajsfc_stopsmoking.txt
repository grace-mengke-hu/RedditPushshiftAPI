I've made it.. now it's staying quit which I think I'll actually do this time.

I'm well over the hump I think. I don't even think I've been tempted the last couple of days and I live with a smoker. I'm chewing nicotine gum but only about 5 pieces a day and the low dose. I smoked for 10+ years, pack a day.

Last year I quit for 6 months. Then I made the mistake of thinking I could have just one. That led to a year of smoking. You just can't have another one, it's as simple as that. No cigarette, no cigar, pipe, etc. 

So to anyone who is thinking this is their first successful quit, great job! Just please learn what I learned last year which is that you really can't have one, no matter what.

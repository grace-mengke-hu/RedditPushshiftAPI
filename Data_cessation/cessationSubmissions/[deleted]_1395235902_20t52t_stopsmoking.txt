Thankful

Today I decided it would be a good idea to thank everyone who made an impact in my life. So I texted messaged and told them i was thankful for the certain things they've done and how they changed my life. It made me feel great. Still sober. Going fine. Quit smoking day 4 one slip up on smoking this morning. Hated the taste, feel and smell. Sticking to the ecig till completely done. So proud of myself. Still having a hard time at night though. Get depressed as all hell. Gotta keep going though!

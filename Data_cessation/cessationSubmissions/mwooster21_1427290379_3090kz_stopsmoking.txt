Coughing up black phlegm after no cigarettes for 6 weeks?

Last night and this morning I noticed i was coughing up some mucus with chunks or streaks of black in it. I haven't had a cigarettes in about 6 weeks. I've tried quitting before and noticed this problem happen within a few days. It seemed like it was normal since the lungs are ridding themselves of tar. But this time I thought it was a little odd that it started so late after my last cigarette. Not sure if it is important but I am using e-cigs to quit smoking and I will be lowering the nicotine over time before getting off it altogether.  I only smoked for about 2 years and at my peak i was probably at 3 packs per week.

I don't feel sick or anything. Potentially allergy related. Since I am mildly allergic to cats (live with 2 cats) and pollen (my bad season isn't until September). Has anyone else experienced this after quitting smoking?

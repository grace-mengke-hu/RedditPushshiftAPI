Well it's finally here, quit day.

To preface, I've been smoking for about 4 years now and have tried to quit seriously twice, both times with an e-cig (both failed, since I just found that it made me want to smoke.

This time I tried something different, I've been slowly lowering my cigarette intake over the last month and a half and supplementing it with patches. Yesterday was my last day to smoke, and now I'm only on the patches. I'm about 33 hours in, which is the longest I've gone without a cig in about a year.

I can't say I feel much better without them, but I plan to stick with it for money reasons primarily. I'm sure you guys here this all the time, but do you have any tips to deal with potential cravings?

starting again today, need your help

I did a whole year, then I got fired in the most unexpected and harsh way and I used cigarettes as a way to cope.

That was in February, I've never really been the pack-a-day sort, mostly 3 or 4 a day, then going hard on them when I drink. 

Now two out of three of my roommates smoke... and we're drinking tonight for international beer day. I'm gonna do my best to not even bum a cig off of them... But it's going to be tough. I was just reading an askreddit where OP asked why people still smoked, and I totally agree with the relaxation aspect of it.

oh wells, here goes, I'm going to post here whenever I feel like hitting it so I can put my thoughts to words and be aware of it.

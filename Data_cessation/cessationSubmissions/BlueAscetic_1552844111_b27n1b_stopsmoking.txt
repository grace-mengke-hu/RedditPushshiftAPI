Day 7! Headaches, but feeling less depressed &amp; sad

I decided to quit officially on Sunday, last week. I have "tried" multiple times after smoking for 8-9 years, but always asked for a cigarette from someone, wanting my partner to come over so I could have some of his. This time, I'm not smoking, at all. I'm also in recovery for alcohol, and I'm 9 months sober from that. I feel so much better today - I woke up and felt happy I am quitting smoking.

I didn't intend to stop smoking, but lately my lungs have started to hurt. I have a friend at work who I would go out and have a cigarette with, who just got news she has cervical cancer, most likely due to her smoking. I've only smoked 2-4 cigarettes a day for the last 8 or 9 years, but it's still affecting my health and self-esteem and I can feel it. The mood swings are going away, but more being replaced by headaches. I can handle it, though. I can handle the thoughts in my brain telling me to go to the gas station. I can handle the heaviness in my head and throat. I can handle the pain in my teeth. It's all worth it, smoking for the rest of my life or trying to quit once I've gotten a dreaded diagnosis is not worth it.

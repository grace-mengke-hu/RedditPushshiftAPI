I want to quit but I'm scared of Chantix though. What are you guys doing/using to quit?

I'm 30 and have been smoking a pack a day for 13 years now..newports at that :(

I've never coughed up blood but my throat always feels swollen and I'm scared I already have cancer and am too scared to go to the doctor.

what is wrong with me. I am scared the doctor will tell me i have 5 years left to live. I'd rather just die in 5 years than to find out now. My mentality about it sucks. My girlfriend hates them, but tolerates it. I just want to stop smoking. I just got back from a cruise and chain smoked almost the entire 5 days. I had these headaches I get only when I smoke too much. The right side of my throat (maybe my lymph nodes) feel so twisted up sometimes and scares me to death. 

I want to live for a long time. My mom's side of the family all dies at around 50 years old from lung cancer. My dads side doesn't smoke and they all live into their 90s.

Help me

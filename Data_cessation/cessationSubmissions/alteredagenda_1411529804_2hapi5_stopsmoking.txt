Dealing with nights out/drinking!?!?

Haven't even hit one week yet...

The last few days have been absolute hell as far as avoiding smokes.  Tonight I had a few drinks with friends in anticipation of a big event.  I feel more compelled than ever to have a smoke... I went out earlier and smelled others smoking and felt drawn in... Instead of bumming a smoke I walked to the market and bought a (non-nicotine) e-cig... I puffed on that for a bit and did my best to take my mind off of the urge to smoke. 

How do I deal with this?  Booze seems to be such a significant mental pull!

6 hours left of the 72.

I'm just scanning around, looking for a cute little bunny rabbit or something so I can tear it's head off with my teeth, rub it's blood all over me and screamgrowl as loud as I can... Hee... hee... :) 

(sitting smiling hands folded)

I got this though.  No nicotine for 72 hours no drinking for two weeks no bars for a month and no adderall (which I don't really take anymore anyway) for a month or two).  Enforce those rules I'm good every time.  Also helps to think I'm allowed to smoke again after the 30 day mark, but I never do.  Anyway..

Good job everyone!  Back to work.

Smoking while drinking

Hey everybody, new to this sub but I'm a bit at my wits end and hoping for some wise words. I can't count how many times I've tried to quit smoking, it's been 10 years and I'm going for good this time - my problem is that when I drink socially I can't help but smoke, I don't want to stop having a few every now and then but I also don't want to be tempted when I have a drink. Is there anything that you do to push through?

Quitting again. For real this time.

I decided to grab my pack of cigarettes that I swore were my last. I grabbed all 8 that I had left and broke them in half. 

My boss's stepson just passed away from oral cancer last Wednesday. He never smoked in his life, and for all intents and purposes, he was healthy. It just over took his body in such a short amount of time and took his life. 
I smoke a pack of cigarettes every two days. What makes me think that I'm invincible? 
I decided to look at my mouth too, and it looked like I had a white bump in the back of my mouth. Which, it could be from biting and grinding at night. I'm not taking a risk. I have set an appointment tomorrow to check it out. 
Needless to say, I'm scared. I'm upset that I have smoked for 4 years thinking that nothing could happen to me, that this was a harmless habit. I'm angry that I've wasted so much money and so much of my life smoking, thinking that it was helping anxiety. In reality, it has riddled me with anxiety. 

I'm done. I am ready to quit.

Day 4: observations

* There's more time in a day (whereas before I'd constantly feel like I was running out of time)
* I move/think/work more slowly (which I thought was a con, until I realized that constantly running at full tilt is probably hard on my body/mind) 
* subtracting cigarettes is not enough to be at peace, I'm going to have to take up exercise to realize the physical potential here
* When I'm not dealing with a craving, there's this genuinely nice glowing feeling (circulation? I'm not sure, but it's similar in some ways to the euphoria induced by stimulants, sans chewing your jaw off and feeling bored of existence)
* I'm able to enjoy what I'm doing, because it's not merely "stuff between smoking". Still getting used to that. It's weird to find myself in a rush, only to remember I have nothing left to rush towards.

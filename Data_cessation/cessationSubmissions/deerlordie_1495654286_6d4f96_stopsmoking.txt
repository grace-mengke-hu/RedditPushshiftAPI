77 days in.

I made a deal with myself that if I could go 90 days (somehow always the habit breaking number I go for) I'd get my thigh tattoo finished/reworked. Multiple times, when I wanted to break and "just have one" I thought about how that one cigarette would mean not being able to make that appointment..... yet here I am, day 77, and I still can't get myself to call and set up a consult. As if I can't trust that I'll make it to 90, even though I'm so close. When will I earn my own trust back?

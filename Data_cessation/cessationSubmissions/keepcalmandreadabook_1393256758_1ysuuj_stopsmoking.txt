Here we go again. Fuck.

I started smoking again last week after 185 days clean after I was with some friends and we toked up. For some reason, toking up makes me really *really* want a cigarette apparently, and since I splurged on that all week I've been splurging on cigarettes too. I have to quit the former **like yesterday** so I'm going to quit smoking cigarettes **today**. I've been trying to quit all week, honestly, and I keep finding stupid excuses.

I want to start jogging again. I want to wake up and not have my lungs feel like shit. I hate coughing out all this shit. I miss running up and down the stairs without feeling like I'm about to have a heart attack.

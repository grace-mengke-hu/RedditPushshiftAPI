I haven't completely quit smoking yet but vape helped me!

I started smoking regularly at the age of 16, back then 8 sticks a day was already enough but that was until I was 17 when I was already starting to smoke a pack a day and that continued until I was 18 and that's when I started to smoke more than that, probably an average of 30 sticks a day. I knew I needed to quit when it had gotten to the point where I don't like smoking anymore but it became a habit that I need to smoke, I smoke in my room so the smell really tempted me to smoke, earliest that I would smoke is right after I wake up in morning. I bought a vape last month and it helped me, I cut down from an avg. of 30 sticks to avg. of 4, I couldn't even chain smoke anymore because it tastes like shit and I could definitely smell the smoke of the cigarette now and how awful it is. I'm setting up a date, perhaps the middle of this month that I will now quit smoking for good. I can already see the future me turning down my friends' offer to smoke and finally get back on shape I'm eager to get there! I'm currently 19 by the way. Anyone else have quit through vape?

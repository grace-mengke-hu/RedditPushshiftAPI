I made it to a month!

I set a reminder for myself on my phone a month ago and on that day, I honestly thought I would just wake up and look at it in shame and delete it. But I actually did it!!!! One month free! If I was smart I should’ve downloaded the quit smoking app on the day of so I can see a detailed chart of my health, but it’s okay! I still feel amazing. So I’m just checking in again for accountability. Thanks for your guys kind words last time! I know it’s only been a month, but I’m kinda sorta soaring right now. I’ve been smoking since my first job as a waitress at 17. 6 long years and I’ve never gone more than 3 days without a smoke. It’s hard to believe I made it this long. A big portion of my family is French and truly, they would smoke in the goddamn shower if they could, and most of my friends also smoke. I’ve gotten to the point where hugging some of them is like “Wow, is that what I used to smell like...?” I never noticed it before. Started 2018 off right and I’m hoping this month turns into 12! And good luck to everyone else! Stay positive 🤙🏼

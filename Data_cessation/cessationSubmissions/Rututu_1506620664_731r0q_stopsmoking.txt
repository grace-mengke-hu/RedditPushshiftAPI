Day 22: Suddenly craving again

Hi.

So it's been 21 days and 13 hours since I quit cold turkey. The first 6 days were pretty bad, but after that it's been a smooth ride. I've compensated a bit with video games and food, but nothing too crazy. Didn't really even have cravings for the last two weeks.

Until now.

The thing is, I can clearly see the reason behind the cravings. I'm a little frustrated/angry at my S/O, and I feel like I want to get away or go out. Smoking used to be my escape in situations like this. Almost like a friend who would listen when I had worries. Something I did just for me. Something selfish.

I know it's all bullshit, but damn this is tough. I know I can just as well take a walk or go for a run. Or even better, actually deal with these emotions head on. The cigarettes are the cowards way out.

Its a little discouraging to get cravings again, but at the same time this all feels like some much more than just quitting cigarettesâ€‹. It feels like a growing experience. It's forcing me to face life instead of self-medicating with more and more nicotine. 

The reason for addiction goes deeper than nicotine, and I guess I always knew that. Now it's time to do the work until I don't need the addiction as a crutch anymore. It's time to grow up, I guess.

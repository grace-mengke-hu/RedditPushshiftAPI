This is it. I'm done with smoking.

Just to let y'all know that today I had my last cigarette, ever. Had relapsed into being a casual smoker after going through some personal issues but now I'm done. For good. No more cigarettes. I mean that. No use feeling for sorry for myself and harming my future. You do only get one life, you have to make the most of it and that is what I am going to do from now on. 

**I quit smoking on the 1st of November 2013.**

I'm a little shy to the concept, and don't know what to say, but I want to get this show on the road now!

Please feel free to ask any questions that may help get me started or get to know me if you want somebody to talk to going through the same thing.

~~Edit 1: 9:25 P Central, refraining from going outside for a cigarette.~~

Edit 2: I've gone back to going outside when I feel like, especially if friends go out for a smoke.

I usually smoke a half a cigarette (Pall Mall Red 100s) at a time, and a pack maybe every 2 1/2 - 3 days. Here is a little more info I posted in a comment down below:

> I'll be 24 in November, and have been smoking since around 13. At this point it's hard to be completely serious because I really just don't have the motivation. I don't necessarily love it all the time, but I do acknowledge the fact that I enjoy it at times. I crave nicotine, taking breaks from things, stepping outside, taking that pull, the whole nine yards.
I really want to be serious about this, I just don't know where to begin.

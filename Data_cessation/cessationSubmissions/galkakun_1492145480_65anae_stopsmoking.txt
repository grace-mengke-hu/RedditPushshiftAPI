My way of quitting

I smoke hookah to help my craving and wanted to share this. It's a nicotine free way of smoking other then vaping that calms me. If you want to change this habit of smoking cig with a more casual and social way of smoking I highly recommend. And yes I know its not the cleanest way of quitting, hookah is still an unhealthy habit but not addictive and used a lot less frequently the cig so I find it still a bit better and it helps me in these first few days of quitting

Made it past 2 months, been on and off

Had 2 and a half months no nicotine altogether, relapsed on a camping trip and then stopped altogether again for a month. Been smoking/vaping on and off for the last month getting clean for a day or two then vaping/smoking heavily for several days. Just back to 5 days nicotine free again and starting to feel like I’m back to being firm on quitting. Haven’t posted before but want to reach out and express gratefulness for this sub and the people active, this community is alive and well has been very helpful to me and others. Stay strong everybody

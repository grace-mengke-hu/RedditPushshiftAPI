Set a start date!

After 4+ year I’ve finally set a date for myself to quit! I downloaded an quit smoking app to help keep track since this is the first time I’ve fully committed to being a non smoker again and honestly I am really excited to start this journey back to breathing 100% fresh air all the time! Y’all have given me the motivation to start and I hope to have the chance to share some major milestones like everyone else in the future. Thanks for being awesome everyone!

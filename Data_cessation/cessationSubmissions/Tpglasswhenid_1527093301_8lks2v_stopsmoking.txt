Day 4/NRT/Withdrawal advice

Hey all - day 4 for me. Was a 15 a day smoker 10 years ish cut down to rolling tobbacco for a month (equiv to 3-4 cigs a day) and now using a 7mg nicotine patch 16-18 hours a day. Despite using the patch im definitely getting withdrawal but it does help I notice when I put the patch on in the morning. Im set on being a non-smoker and confident I can do it. Im aware of my day to day triggers and have been able to ignore so far.

I am feelings tons of anxiety, insomnia, sweats and restlessness etc. I also have a MAJOR lack of appetite (likely due to the anxiety). Its all manageable I just hope this is nicotine withdrawal im experiencing and not side effect of patch. The lack of appetite seems off as everything I read indicates an increase but lack of appetite is a major symptom of me experincing anxiety.

My question is for those who used the patch - what kind of symptoms did you experience after stopping the 7mg patch? Was there major discomfort? I think im on my way to recovery but cant decide if the patch is doing more harm than good and if im just prolonging the inevitable period of feeling like absolute shit by chipping away using the 7mg patch which makes me feel moderately like shit. Day 3 was the worst so far which adds up as far as ive read but should I anticipate another ‘day 3’ when im off the patch?

Sorry if this is long and drawn out. I was in acute withdrawals from opiates for literally the first 3 months of this year which did a number on my brain. That experience is making me reluctant to cold turkey nicotine as the last couple months ive finally adjusted to normal but still want to make healthy changes.

Thank you all. First time trying to quit and I feel like im doing well but im having a hard time finding like real-world timelines and experiences of others at this stage.

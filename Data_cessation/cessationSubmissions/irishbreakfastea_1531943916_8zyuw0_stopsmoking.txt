Nicotine gum or not?

Today I woke up and decided today's the day.  For months now I have been constantly sick and disgusted with myself smoking.  It has been weighing on me so much that I realized if I am not going to quit now, when then?

I threw my cigarettes out.  I feel very confident that I can quit.  I have a lot of good reasons why smoking is incompatible with my life.  

I have attempted to quit cold turkey before.  8 years ago I did cold turkey and I ended up quitting for one year.  It was not as bad as I thought, I had just read Allen Carr's book and I was able to quit fairly easier than I had expected

The subsequent cold turkey attempts weren't so magical.  4 months ago when I tried to quit I broke down constantly in tears, trashed a good portion of my house, and made everyone around me so miserable I ruined their day.  I made it 7 days.  Then I tried to quit another 20+ times over the last few months, using the gum (anywhere from 2-7 pieces a day).  The gum made things more tolerable from an emotional standpoint but I still had cravings to smoke and I still gave in.

I really don't want any nicotine in my body anymore though.  I know the gum helps but I am at a point right now where I simply don't want nicotine in my system.  I am afraid of quitting cold turkey and what it might due to me.  I suffer from major anxiety problems as it is.  That being said, I know the gum helps but I really would rather have no nicotine in my body ever again

What would you guys suggest?

Either way, I am quitting today.  I'm never having another cigarette no matter how bad it gets. No more god damn excuses.

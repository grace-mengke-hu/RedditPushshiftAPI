New here, ready to call it quits for good

Hi all,

After quitting for 4 months over the summer, I have been off and on for the past few months. Ready to stop for good, stocked up on toothpicks and have an old e-cig for the bars. Anyways, just wanted to say hi and be able to come in a panic :)

Cheers.

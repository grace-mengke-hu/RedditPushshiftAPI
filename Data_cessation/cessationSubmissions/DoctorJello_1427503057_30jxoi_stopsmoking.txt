First day. Wish me luck.

My last cigarette was last night. My friend and I hang out almost daily and we usually pool our money to buy a pack. He usually smokes two in a row and last night he kept going outside right after we got back. It made me realize I don't want to get too deep into this (I've been smoking for a few months). This morning I bought an e-cig and I've been smoking that.  

Hopefully I can keep this up.

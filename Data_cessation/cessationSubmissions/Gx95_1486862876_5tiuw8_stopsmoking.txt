need to quit

So i started smoking exactly 3 years ago .. didnt have even 1 clean da, thing is i am afraid of trying to quit because i never tried and i dont know what may happen. Is it doable to quit without any substitutes (patches or else)?

What is the worst thing that could happen to me, i know it may differ but i dont want to try and get deceived.. any experiences? Any 'day one's?

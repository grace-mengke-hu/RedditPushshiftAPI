This has probably been asked before..but has anyone been successful with Chantix/Champix?

I have been smoking for 11 years and I'm 26. I habe tried patches, e-cigarettes, gum, inhalers, cold turkey, and Allen Carrs easy way to stop smoking. I even tried to make drastic changes in my lifestyle such as cycling and healthy eating hoping it would give me strength.. still smoking.

My father has been smoking for 30 years and has also tried everything several times including laser therapy and nothing lasted. He tried Champix knowing the side effects and quit..its been 4 months now and he says he can't stand the smell of cigarettes like a non smoker does. I smoke around him and he's fine.

Sooo I started a box. I'm on day 2. I know suicidal thoughts and scary dreams are well known side effects. My mom told me just to take it day by day and if I feel anything bad to stop right away. I have a history of anxiety and anger. But not depression.

Anyway, what have your experiences been? I'm specifically wanting to hear if anyone has been able to get past the side effects? Most stories I've read people have quit right away after any side effects. Did it work long term?

Thank you.

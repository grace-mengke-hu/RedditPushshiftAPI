Close to three years clean. Don't quit like I did.

Yeah I know it's click-baity. Really I just came to say Don't stop trying to quit. If you fail, if you falter, don't kick your own ass too bad, just keep trying.

The gum and the lozenges gave me heartburn like a motherfucker. Chantix has bad drug interactions with my daily meds. Cold turkey was my best option.

Until my gallbladder tried to kill me. That worked. Few days in the hospital after emergency surgery seemed to do the trick.

TL;DR: Quit Smoking Tip: Lose an organ.

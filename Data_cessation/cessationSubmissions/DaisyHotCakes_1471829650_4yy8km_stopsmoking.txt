I have to put this somewhere public because I am sick of smoking. I hate it. Everything about it. I hate that I had quit several times, each time for over a year, and ended up smoking again.

I hate that I ruined an awesome, happy, healthy, one and a half year quit. I felt great. I was in the best shape of my life. Everyday I woke up so happy and grateful. This was over two years ago. Since I smoked that first cigarette, relapsing back into this pit of hell, I have been trying to quit. Every. Fucking. Day. For two years. 

I am trying this again. No fuck that I am DOING this. Apologies...I'm putting this out there to make myself feel accountable, even if it is to complete strangers on Reddit.

Having much difficulty going from one cigarette a day to none

I’ve weaned myself down to one cigarette per day after smoking since age 16. I’ve maintained this one-per-day habit for over month. I suppose that, at this point, I’m probably minimally addicted to nicotine. However, the idea of quitting entirely fills me with dread. Why does going from twenty per day to ten to five to two to one seem easier than going from 1 cigarette to zero? Maybe I’m not “ready” to quit? My doctor told me that smoking a cigarette or two per day isn’t bad at all, so what’s the point beside to say that I’ve quit smoking? 

I ran out of rolling papers today (roll my own) and am trying to decide whether or not now is time to quit or not. Encouragement/advice would be appreciated. 

tldr: Have smoked a single cigarette a day for a while, figure I can't be that addicted to nicotine, still having trouble quitting entirely

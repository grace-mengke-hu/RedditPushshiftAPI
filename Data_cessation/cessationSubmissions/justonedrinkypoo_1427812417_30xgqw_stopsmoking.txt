Still at it.. Sort of

This is a bit of a ramble because I'm just writing with no idea where it's headed.

I stopped smoking on Friday. It has been going well, but I have had to use a vape to subside the cravings a bit. I know a lot of you are against this and consider it "cheating" but to be honest, I've tried cold turkey so many times and it just isn't working. At least with this thing, I am able to actually cut back and take the edge and stress off.

 I consider going from a pack a day and smoking a cigarette every 30-45 minutes, to a few puffs off a vaporizer every few hours, to be a step in the right direction. I feel my breathing coming back, food tastes better, and I am actually disgusted by the smell of someone after they've smoked a cigarette. I can't believe I walked around smelling like that.

When I have a full pack of cigarettes it's like a free for all. If they're there, I'll smoke them. Quickly. I find it so much easier to resist the temptation for nicotine when it's a battery powered, liquid burning stick.

Overall, I am still a bit edgy because I'm not getting the nicotine dose I've been used to for years, but the time between puffs on the vaporizer is getting longer. I really do believe I can beat this. 

Thanks for listening.

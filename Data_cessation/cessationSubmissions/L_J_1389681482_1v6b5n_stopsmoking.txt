One week! ...again

Made it to a week, 2nd real attempt at quitting (made it 2 months previously).  Last time around I went cold turkey, this time I have the e-cig.  Not sure if that will help me stay a non-smoker or just feed the addiction, we'll see.  My downfall is spliffs, sometimes I think I'm more addicted to spliffs than stoges haha.  I know that's the nicotine addiction taking, but still, there's no better way to get high IMO.  Any other stoners trying to remove tobacco from the equation?

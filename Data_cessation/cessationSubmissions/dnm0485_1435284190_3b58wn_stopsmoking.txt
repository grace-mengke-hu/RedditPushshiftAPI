Aggravated and anxious!!!

First post for me brand new to the site. I've been on chantix for 2 weeks and on my 6th day 11th hr smoke free. start of this week was pure he**. I spent the entire day busy my mind was occupied and I probably only thought about smoking a small handful of times. I now and aggravated beyond belief and incredibly anxious. Dying scares me to pieces and if I smoke again I know for sure that I'll die an early death which is obviously less than Ideal. I just want to be done thinking about this.

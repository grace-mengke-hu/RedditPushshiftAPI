Hi guys/girls.... I really need help.

I have quit twice before. Once was cold turkey, and that lasted about 2 weeks, and the second time was with an ecigarette and that lasted about 3 weeks. I know I can do it, but right now I am taking oxycodone for pain and it makes the urge to smoke about a billion times stronger, to the point where I am smoking over a pack a day and I feel like utter and complete crap, but I just cant bring myself to quit or even to cut down. I can't sleep at night because I feel like I am going to die from all this smoking and the psychological effect of telling myself that I am going to quit soon makes me smoke like a god damned fiend. Just tonight I've smoked over half a pack and I already have a major headache, my eyes are bloodshot and my chest is hurting a lot.

I'm going to psyche my self up to quit when I finish this pack.

What I do is tell myself that I'll quit with the pack Im smoking, then when its gone I say, "I can't do it cold turkey so I will buy a pack just for the intense cravings" then I end up smoking that pack like a fiend, then I say, "Ok, so this will be the last pack" and I do it over and over and over unitl I fucking die!!!!

HELP ME!!! any advice would be damned appreciated.

thank you reddit, you are my only hope.

Been wanting to for a while, tonight is it!

It's been 15 years at a pack a day or a little more and I'm done.  My girlfriend is done to, she will cope better. She works an office job and her smoking is much more limited than mine. I on the other hand am a life long carpenter with multiple smokers at work. I've told all of my coworkers about my decision so hopefully that will help out here in the beginning. Also thank you to everyone here at this sub I've been lurking for at least six months and what I've read here has got me to this point!

Please tell me my energy will return.

I'm 20 days nicotine-free, and I absolutely have ZERO energy.  I'm happy going home from work at my desk job, eating dinner, and sitting on my couch until I go to bed, and I usually fall asleep on the couch.  This has prompted me to gain 7 pounds since I quit, partially because food tastes SO GOOD now (which I know is a good thing, but I lost 50 pounds last year and I really don't want to gain it back).  When I think about getting up and doing something, I just want to cry because I don't think I can even find the energy.  I know I should force myself to do SOMETHING (I'm going to make myself go to the gym and walk on the treadmill after work so I can see if I can breathe better), but I just can't.

Redditors who have been nicotine-free for longer than 20 days...did your energy level decrease after quitting, then increase later?  (Please say it increased eventually...)

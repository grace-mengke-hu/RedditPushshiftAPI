Let's fucking do this

I relapsed mid 2013 and am doing this again on my third attempt. I remember feeling like shit when I relapsed and felt like boss when I was 53 days smoke free. This is the last cigarette I'm ever going to smoke in 15 minutes. I'm not going to act like I'm giving something precious up. I'm not going to cave into temptations. I'm better than this. This shit is fucking evil. Fuck these evil cancer sticks. I'm not going to waste my life on poison. 2015 marks the year where I'm officially cigarette free.

Edit 3/1/15: Thanks for the gold! I was having a terrible, terrible day until right now. I'll promise to return back to this community. Stay strong everyone!

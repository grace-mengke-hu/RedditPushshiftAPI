My boyfriend quit smoking a month ago today! 

He quit exactly a month today! And I couldn't be any happier for him! I've been trying to be as supportive as possible. (I have even bought him pack on top of pack of gum & downloaded a StopSmoking App to help count the days). But I know this has been very hard for him, he has been smoking for over 8 years and he finally decided it was time to quit. I know it's hard for him, especially because he has admitted to wanting to buy a pack but always stops himself. 
I'm really happy for him, but I would love to know what else I could do to help, I know he gets cravings and really bad. But what are some tips for me to help him & some tips for him?!

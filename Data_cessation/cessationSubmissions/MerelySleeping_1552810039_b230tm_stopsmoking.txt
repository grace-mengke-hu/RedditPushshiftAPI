7 months, 2 days, 3 hrs, 3 mins (you can do it!!!!)

I just opened my Smoke Free App for the first time in a long time and it’s been 7 months, 2 days, 3 hours, 3 minutes.  I am shocked.  I just stopped counting a while ago.  I quit cold turkey after smoking heavily for about 12 years. You really can do it, and it’s so liberating!  You’ve got this, everyone!

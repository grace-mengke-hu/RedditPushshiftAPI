Irritable

Over the past 2-3 days I've found myself irritable, emotionally down and susceptible to mood swings. I'm sure its because I haven't smoked in almost 6 days. I didn't even notice it until today. Is this normal? I almost want to say "F*** it. I need a cigarette" but I know that in a week I'll end up hating myself for giving up.

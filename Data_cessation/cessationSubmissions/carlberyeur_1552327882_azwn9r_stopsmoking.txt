Remember literaly everything gets better

The cravings will be further apart, the breathing will be better, the sleeping, the breath, the psyche, the endurance and the poop will be better. It just takes a little while to get through, but if you catch yourself thinking that smoking made X better, it's just that you still need to adjust. I just wanted remind you and also tell you newly quitters to always remember! Smoking is not something you give up, it's something you get free of :) stay strong!

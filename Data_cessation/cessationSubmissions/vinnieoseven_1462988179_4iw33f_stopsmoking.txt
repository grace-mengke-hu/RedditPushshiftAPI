One week!

Man, I've been waiting to write this post all week. Although my counter still says 6 days, it has been exactly 7 days now since my last cigarette!

It has actually been relatively easy. This isn't the first time I've quit, I've quit multiple times over the past years but I suppose I wasn't ready to quit for good in those attempts. I've been through quite a lot.

But this time, it started off different. I went through the withdrawal days with relative ease, noticing the withdrawal and cravings clearly but knowing with great confidence that I wouldn't give in.

I value longevity too much to continue smoking any longer. And now I have made it through the first week :). Very happy with this. 

Up to the 14 days (and beyond)!

I'm now on day 100 of no smoking. Here's some unconventional tips and reflections

Disclaimer: **These all worked for me - they may not work for you.** Take what you want, leave the rest. If any of these points prolong someones life by even one day then this post will have been worth it.

1. Every time you say no to a cigarette you get a little stronger and it gets a little easier.

2. The first week is a battle of the body (Physical cravings.) After that it becomes a battle of the mind (Retraining the brain to find a new way to relax and release tension.) The first week is by far the hardest. After that it's a downward slope.

3. Don't see it as noble for trying to quit. For a lot of us, smoking is a guilty pleasure that we know is harmful - similar to eating junk food when we're trying to lose weight. **Personally**, I liken smoking to self harm. It was about gaining control over my body and giving myself the opportunity to treat it badly, and finding relief in that I was the one deciding what level of pain I was inflicting. This was subconscious and it wasn't until I reflected many weeks later that I noticed this behaviour. This is a similar trait held by cutters and people with eating disorders. **This may or may not resonate with you** - but if it does, here's the loophole I found. I tricked myself into treating my not having a cigarette as a form of self harm - by not allowing myself to have what I wanted. Even when the cravings were at their worst - there was a sense of thrill knowing that I was controlling the cravings, I had the opportunity to end them whenever I wanted and I was choosing not to because I wanted to see how far down the pain spectrum I could push myself.

4. Find something else you can routinely obsess over in the place of a cigarette. This can be gum or even water. For me it was sparkling water. This may sound ridiculous - but you'd be surprised what you can manage to become addicted to if you let yourself. For the first month I basically sat at my office desk holding a bottle of San Pellegrino at my mouth at all times.

5. If you have a circle of friends who smoke - don't see them for a month. Or 2 months - or however long you feel it'll take before you gain the courage to not smoke when you're with them. In that month of not seeing them - work on reinventing yourself and look forward to people commenting on how much better your skin looks. (I was told this quite a few times after only a few weeks, actually. I had no idea how bad my skin was until I quit and looked at photos from a few months earlier.)

6. An e-cigarette isn't cheating - but if you buy one, you have to give yourself a time limit for how long you're allowed to use it for. For example,  I bought one and had one small bottle of juice with it. I decided that when the juice ran out, I'd give up. Now, it's several months later and the juice still hasn't run out, but I haven't had a puff for about 2 months because I just don't want one. I'm just not craving anymore. I'm keeping it in a drawer for when the unlikely sudden craving occurs one day down the track.

7. Get a quitting aid app. I got MyQuitBuddy, but I'm sure any of them will do. If I hadn't downloaded it, I'd never have known today was day 100. Every time I got a reminder from the app that I hadn't smoked I felt inspired and intent on being loyal to the app.

8. Learn to talk to yourself objectively and authoritatively inside your own head. For example, when you want a cigarette - develop a voice inside your mind that literally forbids you from having one. Say something like "I don't care if you want one (insert name), you can beg all you want, I'm not letting you have one." I suppose this is a variation of the "higher power" rule in the AA steps to recovery. Side note - this same voice can prevent you from eating junk food!

9. Don't quit at the end of your pack because then smoking will always have that over you - that you finished the pack before quitting. Leave one cigarette in the pack and throw it out, so that you left while you still had the opportunity to smoke more. It's a good feeling (albeit a silly one) all these months later.

10. Don't tell anyone you're quitting until you're a few days in. The longer you can go without saying anything, the better. As soon as you tell someone you've quit, it becomes harder to maintain.

11. By quitting, you'll realise how much time you waste a day smoking. I have always been a "checkpoint smoker". I would always have a cigarette when arriving somewhere, and also when departing somewhere. A lot of the time when I park the car (or get off the bus), I'd stop and have a cigarette break. During my lunch break I'd always have one before and after eating. Now I'm wasting less time getting from point A to B.

12. You'll only gain weight if you let yourself. If you don't eat junk food as a replacement, you won't gain weight. It's really that simple.

13. You'll breathe easier and stop clearing your throat all the time. I remember that when I'd accidentally swallow down the wrong pipe I'd go into a coughing fit. Now if I do that - I just clear my throat for a moment and I'm good again. You don't realise how much you cough until you've quit.

14. Stop being a lazy, ugly, unhealthy piece of shit with no self discipline. Stop letting tobacco have this over your head. Impress the people around you who don't think you have the willpower to give it up. Get better skin. Don't die earlier than need be. Let your failures soak in for a second. Get that panic feeling. It's good motivation.

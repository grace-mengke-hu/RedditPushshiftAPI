Falling off the wagon

Hey guys I quit smoking for about over a year, but after having to put boxing on hold for a month and a half I picked up the habbit again of smoking about 5 cigs a day again. I need to remember why I stopped in the first place and I come to you all to go and drill it in to my hazy brain of why this is horrible for me so I never pick it up ever again and I can leave this filthy habbit alone. I'm diagusted with myself that I stayed away for so long and yet here I am again like a drug addict asking for support.

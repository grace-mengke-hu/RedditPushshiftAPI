I'm an idiot.

I was the one who posted a while about leaving my cigarettes at home and deciding to quit from there. I had quit and had been "quitted" up until last week. I don't even know how long ago that it was that I quit but I was feeling great. I was breaaaaathing, feeling more energetic, and even getting carded buying cigars again, something that hasn't happened for a lonnnnng while! (For marijuana wraps in my state where it's legal...)

Then I met up with an old buddy. I bummed a smoke during this coffee date. It seemed so innocent. Like no biggie. But I had a tremendously stressful week after that which totally broke my daily routine for over 7 days. So all my ish is effed. I bought and smoked SO MANY CIGS SINCE THEN. 

I'm feeling pretty down on myself because I was going so strong until then. I really felt this time would be different. I just finished my last cig from yesterday's pack a couple hours ago. Any words of encouragement, tips, and tricks would be deeply valued. 

Thanks.

I need some advice please

I quit smoking a little over a month ago with Allen Carr's book. It wasn't my first time using the book successfully, I've quit before and then have one and I'm back at it.
That happened again. I'm so disappointed with myself. 
My question is this. I've been smoking a few cigs for a couple of days, I had one this morning.
Should I read the book again or just try to stop right this second and not smoke another today? I'm more of a quit at night person to give myself that 8 hour head start, but now I'm worried that I'll smoke all day and convince myself to smoke again tomorrow. I'm mostly confused. What would you do to get back to day one of no cigs? Any help and advice is so welcome. Thank you guys!

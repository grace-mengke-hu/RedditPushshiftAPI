Tell me about your mornings without cigarettes.

I started tracking my smoking in a journal. I knew mornings were heavy smoking times for me, but now have seen that this weekend I've smoked half a pack before breakfast both days. 

Work mornings are about half of that, but still a first smoke as coffee brews then one with the first cup, get the house up, have another, then one more before I shower for work and abstain for 4 to 8 hours. If I work from home its more like weekends.

Those who have quit- what are your mornings like? How'd you get going in the first week or so?

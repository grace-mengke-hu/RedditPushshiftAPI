I just realized how long it's been

It's been over 3 years since I've had a cigarette! Sure, I still want one every great now and then but it's not a real urge any more. I was smoking up to 3 packs per day up to the day before I quit! The method I used was super effective.  You guys keep going,  I'm proud of yall!

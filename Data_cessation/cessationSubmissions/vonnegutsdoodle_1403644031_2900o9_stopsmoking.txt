I've been given a head start.. now I'm scared

I planned on quitting last Thursday and did manage to stick to that date. Unfortunately, my three year old son (who lives on the other side of the country since he was a one year old and I've never ever smoked near) came down with pneumonia.

I decided to stick to my quit date anyway and flew across the states to see him.

Problem today is that we just got home and I'll be back on a plane soon. It was easy to not smoke for five days in an airport, then a hospital where there were no triggers and I feared it would hurt him. 

But now I'm heading back to my apartment, ashtrays in the kitchen, bars, my office....shit.

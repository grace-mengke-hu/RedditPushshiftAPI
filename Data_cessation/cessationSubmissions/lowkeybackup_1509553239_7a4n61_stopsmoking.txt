5 year smoker waiting to see a doctor for the patch or gum

Sorry if this post triggers anyone's cravings. I don't want anyone here to break their streak because of what I write, it isn't worth it. Congratulations to every person on here that has stopped, no matter the duration.

I'm not ready to stop. I love everything about lighting up and enjoying that punch in the throat. I'm 19 and have been smoking around half a pack a day for three years with my pack a day months here and there. The last two have been about a pack a day average and I switched to spirits both filtered and unfiltered last fall. It's gotten so out of hand. Yesterday, after weeks of having chest pains and feeling like I was going to faint after even slow walks up stairs I said screw it and made an appointment. I can't believe it's gotten this out of hand. I'm 19 and should not be feeling like this, but I feel like smoking is so insidiously engrained in every aspect of my being. I quit once for 6 weeks but went back because I'd look at pictures or my reflection in windows and feel wrong that I wasn't holding a cigarette. I wish I could just be that guy that can smoke on a night out or just have one in a blue moon but that ship sailed when I got hooked after months of buying packs and made myself an addict. I feel like I can't picture myself not smoking another cigarette for the rest of my life. I just need to get this off my chest. If anyone here has never smoked and is just curious, don't ever start. It has consumed me and I'm sure everyone else here can say that for themselves.

One year Today!

So I know I don't post in here much, but I do read a lot.  Theres a lot of great stories to help me keep on the straight path.


I just wanted to share that today is my one year anniversary!  I had smoked for 25 years, and never thought I would be able to do it.


So to anyone thinking you can't do it, you can.  It sucks at times, but its doable!

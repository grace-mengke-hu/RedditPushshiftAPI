2 Years... Still a subscriber :D

I may not come around much, but I still see all the positivity and good efforts in my reddit feed. This was one of the places that helped me along.  
  
You guys introduced me to Easy Way by Allen Carr. To all others, from an 18 year 1-2 packer with several attempts under my belt, it really did work the first time.  
  
If you really want to quit, try the book. Happy breathing, everyone!

Killing social events to stop

I have been smoke free for 3 days.

I see that I am more likely to relapse while drunk and with colleagues who are also drinking and smoking. They offer the cigs, I take them. 

Before, I would go to the store the next day and get a pack for myself. Now, I just feel shitty that I smoked during the social event and try to stay clean as soon as possible.

Problem is, not smoking lasts for 2 weeks, tops.

So I decided to not go to social events with smokers for a month at least, to see how it goes.

Masters in procrastination? N.O.P.E not anymore

Have long appreciated the posters and fellow strugglers/ stragglers out there with me, wanted to post this in the midst of some high stress and every excuse to keep smoking into one of moving swiftly to Not One Puff Ever as my maxim. Was at home with my family today and (again) in the middle of Day 1 of a quit when I started rationalizing how this week at work was going to be really stressful etc. Despite my smoking I'm a big runner, and today is also the first day of a 12 week running program (my goal race, totally due to smoking, was pushed back from October, then to November, now to mid December) and as I sat on the back steps 'enjoying' a cigarette I started thinking, 'maybe I can push the race back to around Christmastime', well of course there are not many races then! I think the insanity of my on again/off again/rationalizing smoking (perversely, via the high volume/quality of running I still do while smoking and my otherwise 'healthy' lifestyle), and this whole stupid game hit me hard (along with an 8 month old and 3 yr old kids) at how insane this is, going on now for 2 years after a 2 year quit. I think that there is a lot to be said for not using substitutes and just breaking it (a la Allen Carr), with no excuses for 'one slip' etc. I am a plant person and I have more than a dozen tinctures and I'm just going to put them away and use them for healing and not substitutes; I've concluded after 2 years that substitutes only prolong the disengagement process. And so, I just smoked my for real final one and got my badge, I hope some other procrastinators will join me and that people feeling tempted to feel like a scoundrel won't be with this small contribution. Thank you redditt stopsmoking community for helping to make it happen for me and I'll do what I can to support people in this community, as well. ONWARD!

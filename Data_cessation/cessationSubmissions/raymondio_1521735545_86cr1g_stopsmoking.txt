Jesus fucking christ.

The anxiety is real. This is my 3rd time 'quitting'- the two times I did quit I made it about 10 months and then thought I "could just have 1". Eleven years of smoking and I'm done now.

But holy shit is the anxiety so real and immediate. I thought the first three days were the worst but day four has proven me wrong. I feel like I have to shake but I can't (kinda like a cold shiver) but it's *right there* and won't go away no matter how much shaking I do. I don't like my girlfriend right now but really I don't like anyone at the moment. Traffic is 10 times worse than it used to be, work is annoying and boring. I feel like all my good feelings are gone forever. I can handle a craving with cinnamon sticks, sunflower seeds, and a brisk jog but my brain is going to be the death of me. "Excellent servant but a terrible master". Ugh. 

Just had to vent somewhere. I know this is all in my head and I just need to hold out until my brain rewires. I think the biggest lesson we learn as quitters that we need to change the 'quick fix' mentality we have; all good comes after patience and hard work, not quick fixes/smoke breaks.

Stay strong, y'all. 


Edit- just wanted to say thanks for the comments and support. They don't help much with wanting to tear my eyes out, but they sure do mean a lot. 4-ish hours later and I've still got this weird chill thing, but I think I'll survive. Thanks y'all; it really does mean a lot.

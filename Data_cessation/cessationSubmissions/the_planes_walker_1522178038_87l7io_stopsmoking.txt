Day 4. Work is destroying me

Just wanted to vent. Last cigarette was Friday at 5pm. The weekend was surprisingly fine. I had quit smoking at the house, which means evenings, mornings and weekends were off limits. I use a vape pen while I'm at home.

Today is my second day at work and it's literally all I can think about. Vape pen is not helping. I have taken 8 walks already. Really jittery.

But I haven't had one.

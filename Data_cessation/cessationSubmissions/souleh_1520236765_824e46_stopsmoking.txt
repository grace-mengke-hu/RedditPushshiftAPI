3.5 weeks smoke free

Just thought I'd add a little post. You see a lot of negative stories around the 'stop smoking' pills but I thought I'd add a positive one.

Backstory: I'm 32, been smoking an average of 20 a day since age 15. Ive tried to quit in earnest 4 or 5 times and never gone beyond a few days. I did once manage 2 weeks after reading the easy way but that too fell by the wayside.

Recently I started to really notice breathing issues in the morning, massive light headedness after even minor exercise and worrying amounts of chest pain.

I've always been wary of the quitting drugs, friends who have used Champix have had all sorts of horrendous side effects. But smoking side effects recently overcame my fear of drug side effects and having just learned of Zyban I asked my doctor.

I had horrific insomnia and felt weird AF when on 300mg, but after cutting down to 150 I have no side effects - aside from a massively decreased desire to drink (which  can only be good) on top of the smoking cessation. I opted to combine with nicorette - which has failed for me several times alone - and so far so good. Im still wary of smoking relapse but ive not had any genuine cravings in over a week and I feel so much better in myself generally too. Nicorette say to use 4-6 carts a day and I use a half and sometimes entirely forget. Not one actual cigarette craving.

Anyway thought Id share my early progress post. In 4 days this will be twice as long as I've stopped smoking in 17 years and I've literally no doubt it's down to the slightly-scary-pills.

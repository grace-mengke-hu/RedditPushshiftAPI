Cravings won't quit

Lately I've been trying to stay away from cigarettes by using a vape and it works most of the time, but from time to time I still get really intense cravings. I've quit smoking so many times, but it seems like nothing works. I've gone cold turkey, used nicotine gum and lozenges, used a vape, and it seems like I always go back to smoking. It kind of feels helpless at this point.

Today I'm really feeling those cravings. I went down from 12mg vape juice to 6mg. I didn't think I'd be feeling so on edge today. So far, I haven't gone out to buy a pack and I'm not planning on it. But every time I go back to smoking, it's an impulse decision and I'm out the door within a few minutes.

I don't know, any encouragement would be appreciated.

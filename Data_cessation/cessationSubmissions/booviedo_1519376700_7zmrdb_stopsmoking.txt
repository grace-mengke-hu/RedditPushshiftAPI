Trying to quit while recovering from an anxiety disorder?

I smoked my last cigarette 5 days ago and I was doing really well. And it felt so good. However, I started to feel a lot of anxiety last night, I think because of the withdrawal. I was also diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder a month ago, and I am recovering with the help of therapy and pills.
What I wanted to ask was, since I am not very mentally capable of handling anxiety yet, would you suggest that I hang on for however long, or I postpone the quitting for a time during which I am much more mentally strong?

How do successful quitters compensate now for the lack of being able to concentrate?

I've been doing pretty good so far. Started 2 weeks ago on the patch, but one thing I have had a big concern for is trouble concentrating. Smoking since 12 and 29 now. 12 and before I've always had trouble concentrating. Unfortunately, cigarettes have been the vice that helps me cope in life. I'm excited about my new smoke-free life ahead of me but am afraid I'll never get that type of focus again. What are some legal ways I can stimulate my mind or replace the cigarette with? Just been eating a lot of ice-cream lately... thinking about puffing flavored tobacco from a pipe or cigar but seems hard to resist inhaling. I go back to school next semester and have to get back to that place in my brain where I can stay focused. *Any* ideas are welcome, and thanks for reading me out here!

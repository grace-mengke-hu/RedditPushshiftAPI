Had a slip and smoked after 85 days

I wish I was joking. I had just wanted one when I was drinking last night and of course that turned into several more.

Iâ€™m going to continue my quit starting today. At almost 3 months, I thought I was out of the woods, but all it took was a little alcohol. 

Stay vigilant everyone.

One work week in!

I just wanted you to all know that I started escaping nicotine addiction last Monday (5/4/2015).  I have been lurking until now, but you folks are certainly a source of inspiration.  I read Allen Carr's book and I am using positive thinking to defeat my addiction.  It is going very well so far and much easier than I expected.  The biggest thing was letting go of my fear of not having my little crutch to lean on.  You guys definitely helped me take the plunge.  SO THANK YOU!!!

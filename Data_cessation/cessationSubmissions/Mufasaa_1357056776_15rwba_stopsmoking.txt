Had to deal with a psych med switch, but now I'm done for good!

My psychiatrist took me off vyvanse which was pretty rough, and I felt like I needed to smoke to deal with it. But now, 2 weeks later I'm feeling good on my new meds and don't need any stinking (literally) cigarettes to make my mind at ease. Ready to start the new year fresh and finally cigarette free! Tore my remaining cigarettes apart, flushed 'em down the toilet, and threw away my lighter! Good Riddance to cigs, and Happy New Year! I wish the best of luck to all my fellow non-smokers in these days, weeks, and months to come and may you live happy, long, and most importantly smoke-free lives!

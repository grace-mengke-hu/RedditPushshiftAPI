I smoked for the very time, would appreciate thoughts

I have never smoked cigarettes before. I was at a party and some friend offered me some cigarettes. I smoked about five cigarettes. I had a good time. I only did it to see what it was like. I'm 22.

That was last night. I feel like a complete idiot for choosing to do something like that. I just fear that I will become addicted or something. I mean, nicotine is the most addictive substance in the world. What I was doing was dangerous, right?

I always told myself I would never become a smoker.

I honestly don't feel like going out and buying a pack of smokes. I don't think I am going to start smoking everyday. I don't want to waste my money on it.

But doesn't everybody say that? Doesn't cigarette smoking start slowly and just builds up and up? 

I mean, I don't think I am going to smoke again unless maybe someone offers a cigarette. But again, isn't that how a nicotine addiction starts? 

I mean, right now I sure wouldn't mind a cigarette. Honestly I liked smoking it. HOWEVER, I know they are very, very bad so I'm choosing not to smoke right now or ever again really I guess. But doesn't everybody say that?

Just would appreciate some thoughts and input. 

EDIT: I have this stupid idea I can just smoke at parties and be a social smoker. I will just never buy my own pack. Or is that a really stupid idea?

First time wanting to quit, need some clarification on a few things

So I've decided I no longer want to be a fiend to the nicotine. A little background, I started when I was 18, (21 now) so almost 3 years. I had my last 3 cigs from my pack Thursday night while working. (I work a stressful job, serving at a restaurant.) I went home that night without buying a pack. 

So the next day I wake up and I feel like I might be getting sick. Minor sore throat, no appetite, I'll be cold one minute then sweating the next. I go to work and start feeling even more sick. I make it all the way until 1030 before I ask to bum a cigarette. I go home again without buying more.

Today, my throat kills, and I mean kills! I have a bad cough, insomnia is horrid. Headaches, diarrhea, no appetite. I had today off and have not had a cig. I would usually smoke maybe a little less than half a pack a day. Sometimes more just depends.

I am also quitting weed to try to get a job this summer. I am a recreational user of many substances; adderall, alcohol, and always smoke more on those. I'm thinking I should avoid these for a few months. Don't know if anyone else has success using other substances while quitting nicotine. 

So after that wall of text, (sorry) am I just experiencing a bad cold that is helping me quit? Mainly the sore throat. Or is this indeed withdrawal? How long can I expect the sore throat, insomnia, no appetite to last. I haven't really been craving it that bad yet but I haven't left my bed all day. Thanks for any positive vibes and encouraging words!

Is the Quitter's Flu making my cold worse?

Hello. I came down with a virus and stopped smoking the day I felt the first tickle in my throat. It is my ninth day without a cigarette and I feel pretty nasty still. I feel like I should be showing some improvement with regards to my cold by now but no luck so far. 
My question is this: could the quitter's flu be upon me already? I've heard that people often get some flu-like symptoms when they quit. Did any of you who quit like I did feel an exacerbation of your symptoms from smoking cessation? Any help is very much appreciated!

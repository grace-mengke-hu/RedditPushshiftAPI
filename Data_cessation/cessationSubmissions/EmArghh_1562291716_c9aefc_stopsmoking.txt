Feeling the 'sads'..

I am just over 2 weeks smoke free with the help of NRT patches. My last quit I fell into the worst depression ever, had no desire to do anything and just didn't care. I'm always doing something! Super motivated and love to fill my days with a bit of everything. Last time when I got really low I had to see my doctor and tried some meds which just made me feel weird but they helped. But of course I started smoking again..

I went cold turkey that time and thought using NRT this time would help to avoid feeling so low but it's truly starting again. I don't know where I'm going with this but I would love some advice or stories of how others got through the same crappy bit? 

I am doing everything health wise but am just starting not to have any drive nor ambition..

Is now the wrong time to quit?

During a one week holiday I stopped smoking 9 days ago with my SO. The reason I wanted to quit was our upcoming longer holidays. We will travel around Asia for one month and I hate the stress to step outside a hotel to smoke. 


Here is how it went:

Day 1 the craving was very bad.
Day 2 + 3 I got depressed and had a fight with my SO. Fortunately she is very supportive and knows that my addiction was angry and mad at her. 
Day 4-8 was pretty god. Only thing I missed was smoking to pat on my shoulders (after cleaning the dishes, laundry).

Now here comes the strange part. I am back at home and back at work. My SO is one week away for work so I am alone at home. Back at home/work the cravings are much harder than a week ago. There are so many situations where I used to smoke...
Unfortunately the depression kicked back in. And my SO told me she could not stop and is now smoking 2-3 cigs a day. She wants to quit when we go to Asia. 


I hope the depression goes away before we go to Asia and here is the reason why: We waited for so long to go to Asia and we saved for a long time to go to Asia. I will not ruin this holiday with my depression! If it does not get better I am 99% sure I will smoke again and try to quit later. 


I will try to go to the gym. Maybe working out can get my dopamine levels back to normal.  
Or maybe now is just not the right time to quit.

Four and a half months... thought cravings would be gone by now

Quit four and a half months ago, on my third try in two years. No nicotine from any source since then.

Then this week I'm getting gnarly cravings again. Last night I had a dream I was smoking and it was oh so nice.

I'm still resolute in my quit (my 9 mo old son is my reason #1), but damn, I thought the claws wouldn't still be in me this far along.

Stay strong quitters.

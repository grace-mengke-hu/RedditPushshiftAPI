By the time I'm done typing this, the craving will be over

I'm having a really bad nicotine craving right now.  I'm a journalist by profession, so I'm trying a technique to combat the cravings.  That technique is to just keep writing something until it stops, hence this post.  

It's funny to think that by the time I'm done typing this out, that 3-minute craving will no longer be an immense monster chasing me, but only a tiny little chihuahua chewing at my ankle.    



I've been typing for about 1 minute now, so just two more should do the trick.  So far, this technique has really helped me, so I suggest using this thread as a personal diary to write in.  You could just ramble for three minutes, use it to write a message to your addiction, whatever.

Three minutes, and this craving is gone.  



Edit: Cravings are back.  My fingers are not leaving the keyboard until it's gone.  If I don't stop typing, then I can't fail.  I'm a little concerned about my health.  After quitting, I have started drinking a lot more to help me sleep at night.  Luckily, I have time off work until Thursday.  I woke up today, completely hungover.  Last night, I drank so much that I was vomiting horrible black stuff.  About half an hour ago, I tried to drink an energy drink, but the first sip caused intense stomach pains.  I've never been much of a drinker, but I need to be careful to avoid developing an addiction to alcohol too.  I've gotten drunk every night the last ten days just to sleep.  I start back at work Thursday, so I can't do that anymore.  I need to stop drinking too.  Instead of drinking myself to sleep, I should start going to the gym right before bed.  Maybe I can make myself tired through exercise.  Too tired to miss smoking.

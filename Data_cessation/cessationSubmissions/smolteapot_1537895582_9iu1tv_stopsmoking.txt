Post breakup chain smoking. I need to stop.

I don’t want to. 
I didn’t even want to start.

But he hated me smoking. I used to do it sporadically. At parties and such. Or when I was feeling so sad about our fights and such that I would. He kicked me out of his house, ignored me and started dating other people. 

So I started to smoke. And I haven’t stopped. That was 4 months ago. I’m doing much better. 

But I’ve let myself fall into the habit now. I’ve always been pretty and I’m told I look young for my age (22) but I’m afraid I’ve smoked so much that I’m even starting to age myself from this. I still want to smoke.  But even vanity is telling me not to. 

What to do first? How do I talk myself out of it? 
Any help would be so so so much appreciated!

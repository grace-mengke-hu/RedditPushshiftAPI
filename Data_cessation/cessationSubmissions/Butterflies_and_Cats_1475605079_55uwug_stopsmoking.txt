Struggling to find reasons to quit. I really liked smoking, I am Diabetic and my doctor asked me to stop so I'm stopping. But...

Besides saving money, I don't know why else I'm doing it.  I guess I'm waiting to want to quit.  I should probably do some reading on how cigarette smoking effects diabetes.

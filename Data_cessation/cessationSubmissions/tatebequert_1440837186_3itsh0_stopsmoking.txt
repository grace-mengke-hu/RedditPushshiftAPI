Day #0. The power of external accountability.

Tonight (6:22 PM, Australia EST) I quit smoking after an almost ten year relationSHIT that has dominated every waking thought and has shaken me from many a slumber in search for a high since I was fifteen years old.

I am not writing in this sub for "You go girl" or "way to go buddy" reasons. I am writing this resolute declaration of nicotine abstinence so to alleviate some of the pressure I am about to impose on myself to a "higher power" (Reddit) of a kind.

I am 24, overweight, progressively becoming the chaddiest Chad I can accomplish (but that's another sub entirely) and live my life to its maximum earning, slaying and success raking potential.

My goals are to be a successful actor, and that means I have to accept that I may become a role model and I need to prove to myself that I am prepared to do what it takes to be the best I can be for myself and for the lives that I touch with my acting and public presence.

I hate smoking, I fucking hate it, but I am an addict and I admit it vehemently. But I will NOT tolerate it in my life or social life any longer. And if that means that I lose friends, family members who want to cut me down to maintain that support to excuse their own self-destructive behavior, so be it.

I am giving up my power to you guys, because I know that if I can keep myself clean for the sake of total strangers that I will probably never meet, I can ultimately come to terms with the fact that I can eventually do it for myself and won't need that support network any longer.

I'm counting on many great posts and proclamations of victory and earnest struggle to keep me grounded.

Here we go...

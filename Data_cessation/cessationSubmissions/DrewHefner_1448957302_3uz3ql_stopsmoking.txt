I'm finally ready.

I've been an on again off again secret smoker for about a year and a half now and I'm tired of it. Tired of beating myself up about falling back on smoking which many times has let me to binge drinking when I do pick up a cig because I hate myself for it. I've read Easyway awhile ago and will begin re reading it soon, but the book thats really given me a kick in the ass is The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg. It's really given me insight into what my cues are that make me reach for a cig and how to change my routine when i have the urge to smoke. It also explains that even with changing the routine you can never really truly change until you believe that you can change. I can say with certainty that I truly believe I can overcome this terrible unhealthy habit. As I write this I'm lying in bed ending my first day as a non smoker and I couldn't be more excited.

Made it through week one with a girls weekend to boot!

Hi I am so proud of myself I’m eight days free and went to an all girls weekend at a friends cottage.  There was one cigarette smoker and three that smoked weed.  They all hacked and coughed but the one who smoked cigs was coughing so hard she couldn’t catch her breath and started using an inhaler between smokes.  That’s soooo not going to be me.  I just sat there with my coolers and feeling incredibly sad for her and happy for me.  If that doesn’t prove I’ve made the right choice i don’t know what will.  P.S this is like thousand quit and I’ve read Allan Carr at 10 times and it didn’t work for me.

This weird thing is happening to me. I've been over 3 weeks quit, mentally have absolutely no desire for cigarettes or vape, yet my brain will still crave them occasionally, and when it does, it hits hard.

Title pretty much says all. I have days where I just have immense cravings, even though mentally I have 0 interest in them anymore, I just don't care to smoke or vape. But I will still get cravings that kind of feel like withdrawal symptoms, like I'll feel flush, get a headache, and have that feeling that I just want one, but again, at the same time, couldn't possible care less about smoking/vaping. It's a strange sensation.

So what's going on here?

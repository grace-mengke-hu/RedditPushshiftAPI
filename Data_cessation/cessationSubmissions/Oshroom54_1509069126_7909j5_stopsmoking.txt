Tired of nicotine, how do I quit.

Hey guys, thought I'd run some questions by you all since google is doing me no good. 
I've been a smoker for about...I think six years? I don't even remember. Half of however many years were with "analogs" or real cigarettes, with one year being kind of a bridge between them and vaping. The other half (up to now) has been entirely vaping. 
      I started out at a ludicrously high nicotine level (32mg, I think? I get nauseous thinking about it...) And tapered down due to anxiety and tension issues. Now I'm at 3mg. 
       I don't like how nicotine intake makes me feel anymore. If I'm honest with myself, there are absolutely no benefits attached to it. I usually lie to myself, saying things like "it helps me focus, it helps me pull through long nights when I need to, it calms me down when I'm stressed, it reduces my appetite so I don't eat as much" yadda yadda. You guys know the drill. The reality is: I get frequent headaches. My gut is on fire more often than not, and I deal with acid reflux. I'm fairly certain smoking makes me tense up; I'm MORE anxious with nicotine coursing through my veins than without it. And since I'm vaping...I chain vape, all day. It's quite literally an adult pacifier. 
     The problem is, when I quit (or when I attempt to quit, more accurately stated) my mind jumps to all these ridiculous...I guess you could say pseudo-philosophical places. Such as, "well if I just drank more water, I'd be fine." "Well, if I just ate right." "If I just exercised more." "I'm overthinking it, it's not that big of a deal/its all in the mind/psychosomatic." So on so forth. Basically I go into self-gaslighting mode and I end up squashing my attempt to kick it. 
     I was wondering if any of you have been through this and what pointers you might give in this situation. 
Anyways, thanks for existing as a group to come and at least gripe about it/get it off my chest, sincerely.

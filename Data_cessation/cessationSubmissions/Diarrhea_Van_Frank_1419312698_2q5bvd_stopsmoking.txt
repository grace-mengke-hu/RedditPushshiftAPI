New Year's Resolution

I'm finally ready to quit for good. I've got a big list of things that I'm going to do when the new year rolls around, but the biggest two are going to be getting sober and quitting smoking.

Drinking and smoking are my two biggest vices, and it's time to give them up. They're becoming problematic, and I can't do one without the other. Time to call it quits.

I want the next year to be the healthiest, clean-livingest year of my life so far. I'm cautiously excited. I know that it's going to be hard as hell, and I know I'm going to want to crack at some point down the road. But I'm ready to face those challenges when they come. I know I can do it, and I know you guys will have my back.

So whaddya say, guys? Help me make nicotine my bitch?

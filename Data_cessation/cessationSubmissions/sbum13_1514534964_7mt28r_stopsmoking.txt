Quitting smoking now after 13 years!

I got off work tonight and had two cigarettes left. Usually I buy a pack right after, but decided I’m going to quit today.

It’s going to be an uphill battle. I know because I like smoking and been doing it for 13 years. However, my health hasn’t been the best so I decided this is it! Self diagnosing here, but I believe I have bronchitis and eczema and I’m only 27! 


I just wanted to share and hopefully read some encouraging words to help me get through this. Maybe this post will help others that have been smoking for a long time to commit to quitting! 


Edit: Should I cold turkey or get patches?

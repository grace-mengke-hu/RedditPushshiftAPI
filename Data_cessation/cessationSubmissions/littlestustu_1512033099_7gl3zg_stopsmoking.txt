A Breakthrough!

I'm just about to tick over to 16 days. For me that's a tremendous effort given my best is 17 days only due to a very bad illness.

I have Coeliac Disease, so for anyone out there who doesn't know what that is, if I eat gluten it causes a huge problem health wise. 

I keep having moments of weakness that almost push me to the edge, but I realised a few days ago that I wouldn't just eat a tiny bit of gluten because I miss it, so why would I do the same with a ciggie? Although the cravings are strong, this mental note has got me through those shitty moments. 

Good luck all :)

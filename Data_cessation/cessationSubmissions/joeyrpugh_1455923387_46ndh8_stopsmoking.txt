It's been a whole year now... smoking that is

I just returned from a vacation during my reading week, and upon returning and buying a pack I had a sudden realization that it was my trip one year ago now to Cuba that I started smoking.

I smoked my fair share of weed at the time, and used smokes in Cuba as a replacement since weed was not an option (plus smokes were super cheap there). By the time I returned (after smoking at least 3 packs in the week I was there) I found myself buying more packs and before I know it I was a confirmed smoker.

So now, one year later I'm buying a pack and it hit me. I've been doing this for a WHOLE YEAR. I've been telling myself "oh, well you have to work" or "you just got paid" with the decision being "a pack has at least 20 in it, so you have 20 cigs until you quit".

I've been convincing myself that I've been trapped for a whole year but I keep locking myself in. This has got to be it, as I've spent at least $1500 on smokes since I started only a year ago. I've been flying through this pack because I can't throw it out (personally), but I know I'm not buying another one. I really hope it sticks this time, I'm so sick of ruining my health and wasting my money. I've never been so upset with myself then now. 

So here it goes, the reason I came here to post in the first place... This is my last hurrah. With each cigarette I've been more and more grossed out, making it thru less and less of each one before throwing it away. This isn't just my last pack.... 

IT HAS TO BE

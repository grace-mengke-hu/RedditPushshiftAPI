I May Be In Trouble

I am diagnosed with Major depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, and panic disorder, with a history of suicide attempts. I made the decision to quit two weeks ago, and tried cold Turkey. Three days later I found myself with nicotine gum. That didnt work either. Four days later I found a patch on my arm. For a week it was great. I woke up this morning in the middle of a violent panic attack that I had to ride out. Believing I could help myself, I went for a walk. I got home, and had another panic attack. Now I've smoked 2 cigarettes and my suicidal ideations are back. If my bottle of prescription clonazepam wasn't almost empty, I would've swallowed them and just went to sleep. Meditation hasn't helped. Exercise hasn't helped. My team of therapists and doctors hasn't helped. And to top it off I'm extremely nihilistic. So I'm begging you. Please help me.

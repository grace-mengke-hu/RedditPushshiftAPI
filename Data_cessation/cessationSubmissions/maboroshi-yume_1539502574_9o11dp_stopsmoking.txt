how to encourage my dad to quit smoking, and further more, how to get off of it slowly?

hello, I am new here (with posting in general) and I am in need of advice. My father is 63. 
In the first few days of March, he had lung surgery to remove growing mass of cancer from his lung (they discovered it in December when he went in due to a heart attack). 

A few months after that, he took chemotherapy to kill the remaining cells and the doctors used radiation to prevent any other cells from reaching  his spinal cord.

He is currently in remission, but all this time, he has continued to smoke and i keep thinking that the cancer's going to come back. We switched him off of cigarettes to rolling paper and cut tobacco but I just don't think it helps (he says he coughs less though). 

Everytime I ask him about it, he tells me that he's too old and it won't matter. I'd like for him to see me and my sister's graduations in the future, and for him and i to have a better relationship eventually as well.

thank you so much

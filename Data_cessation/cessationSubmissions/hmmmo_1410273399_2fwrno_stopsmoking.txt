Looking for help/advice and an answer to a question regarding smoking!

Hello! So I'll get right to it then.
I was smoking e-cigs for like 4 months and never really had any notgood?le health effects, including no withdrawal symptoms. I would say I smoked about 20 of them max in that period, each being about "400 puffs". Anyways I smoked a full pack of ugh Cheyenne filtered cigars (pretty much cigarettes) within a week. Right now, my throat is pretty sore. I am determined to quit and refuse to buy anything else containing nicotine, and I have started working out.

Anyways, what is some advice that might help me avoid nicotine containing products and quit smoking for good? Also I'm concerned about my health now. I'm coughing and my throat hurts like I said. How bad do you think my current condition is? Im honestly terrified of throat cancer and I'm just wondering what it's looking like right now.

So yeah I guess this is kind of a desperate post, but I need to quit while I'm determined and relatively new to smoking. Thank you so much

I was so excited to quit tomorrow but now Im a wreck!

I've been planning all week to quit in Saturday. My boyfriend has been giving me all these activities to do to help me prepare and I really felt like this time would be different. This time, after 15 years of smoking and countless failures I was gonna succeed. 

Well he and I just got into a big fight and now I'm a ball of stress and anger and I'm terrified that I'm gonna fail. Part of me wants to just wait and find a better day, but I know they'll never be a BETTER day. I'll always find reasons to NEED to smoke because that's what my addiction wants. It wants me to stay trapped but I don't want to be anymore. I want to escape from this addiction that's kept me in its grasps for more than half my life. I'm just afraid that I'm setting myself up for failure before I even begin. Especially since he and I did not resolve our argument so I'm still so angry. 

I think I needed to just get this all out and I've been reading this sub for several days and everyone here is so supportive and understanding. I'm not going to let this keep me smoking another day. I'm going to take some deep breaths, clear my mind, smoke my last cigarette ever, go to sleep and wake up a non smoker. I'm looking forward to telling you about my success tomorrow. Good night all.

So I ended up throwing up today...

So about a month ago, I decided that it was time to quit smoking. I called the 1 800 number, signed up, talked to a coach, and all that jazz. Cold turkey worked for about a day, and I have been smoking swisher sweet cigarillos since then. They don't cost as much and I don't like them as much, and they have been keeping me from just buying a pack. I have been cutting down on smoking, even though I know this isn't the best way to go. Anyways, today I lit an extinguished swisher sweet that I had previously been smoking, and I almost immediately threw up. I've been feeling nauseous lately whenever I smoke, but this time the nauseousness finally won. I guess my question is, is this to be expected when quitting? is it because i switched over to just smoking the cigarillos? is it maybe just a mental thing? Any info would be appreciated.

day 5: oh yeah quitter's flu

i was smoking 0-5 cigs/day regularly for the past year or so. plenty of days with none, but plenty of days with 5. so we'll say average of 3/day. i've tried quitting many times, and have successfully had 3-day streaks before giving up, but i think this time it's going to stick. it feels different. feels like i'm doing it for me instead of for anyone else. feels like i'm ready to just let go and move on with my life.

i haven't touched a cigarette since last week but i have had some hits on a vape. i woke up today, on day 5, with the worst sinus pressure ever, and sneezing non-stop. the last few days were okay, but i did have some gum pain (whenever i have sinus pressure i have gum pain) and general tightness/discomfort of my facial muscles. also blowing my nose quite a bit, randomly. and my throat hurts like crazy. really sore. 

honestly, its annoying to now have sinus pain, but i'm kind of loving it, too???? it makes me feel like my body is starting to recognize and repair the damage i've done to it over the past years. 

i'm not a smoker anymore. these sneezes are my badges.

New to this community. 5th day without a cigarette.

I've quit several times before using different methods - e.g. vape, cutting down slowly - but this time I am going cold turkey. The longest I've been without, since starting, is one week. 

It's been pretty hard to stick to it simply because 80% of my office mates and friends are heavy smokers. Pretty much the whole community smokes. My husband doesn't smoke, which helps *a lot*, but we both love to drink with our friends, who smoke even more heavily when we are consuming alcohol.

I am on my 5th day without cigarettes. In that time, I've been able to sit through 4 different parties where nearly everyone was smoking. During my previous attempts to quit I almost always gave in at parties, but I'm proud to say that the I did not budge over the last 5 days! I know that if I can go without smoking while drinking, quitting for good is possible.

Wish me luck, glad to have found this subreddit!

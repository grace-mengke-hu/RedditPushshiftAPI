That's it, I'm sick of this, I'm f*****g done!

I'm tired of getting into my car in the morning and smelling how foul it is - I'm tired of being embarrassed to give people rides for that matter. 

I'm tired of hiding from my children to have a quick puff and I'm sick of feeling ashamed when they come out to see me and I'm smoking. 

I'm sick of being reluctant to kiss my wife or hug my kids when I get home, lest I cover them in my gross poisonous filth.

I'm tired of always wondering if THIS will be the one that gives me cancer. I'm sick of panicking at every cold or mild health problem. 

I'm sick of wondering if the twinge in my back isn't just the gastro-oesophagial problem I'm getting checked out, but a sign I've already left it too late. 

I'm tired of second guessing the doctors and specialists who say that they've checked and it's actually fine - not cancer, don't worry. 

I am FUCKING tired of telling myself "just when I finish this carton I bought duty free", "just once I settle into the new job", "just once I get over the new year because quitting on a new year's resolution is so cliche". Always next month, always before the year is out. 

I'm sick of voluntarily destroying my body and paying handsomely for the privilege.

I'm sick of the shame. I'm sick of the fear. I'm sick of throwing away my life, when I have so much to live for.

Fuck smoking. Today I am done.

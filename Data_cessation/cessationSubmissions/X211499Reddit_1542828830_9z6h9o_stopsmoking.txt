Should I quit vaping? Read pls

Hey guys, I have been vaping for a little over 2 years now. I started when I was 18, am 20 now. I started with cigarettes but decided I don't want to get lung cancer so I thought maybe vaping would be a better option. I love it, it's great. I like the taste, I like the hobby and most of all I like the nicotine buzz ( it helps me focus ). I decided to quit a week ago because I thought enough is enough. I just stopped smoking, I was at 18mg nic MTL for 2 years, I thought it would be horrible like most people go through but for me it was really... easy? I just  stopped and I had some cravings but to be honest I feel much worse without coffee in the morning. It was like, I want to vape but It wasn't hard to stop myself. 

Could it be that I'm just one of those who don't get addicted? Maybe vaping is different, I don't know. Anyway, I was wondering, should I stop vaping? It's been a full week now, I haven't touched nicotine. I miss it, just like I miss coffee but I'm asking you the reddit community. Vaping is considered "safe", of-course oxygen is better but oxygen doesn't help me focus and relax. Are the consequences of vaping not worth the enjoyment? If someone told me coffee is 95% less dangerous than cigarettes I would still drink it... so why should vaping be any different?

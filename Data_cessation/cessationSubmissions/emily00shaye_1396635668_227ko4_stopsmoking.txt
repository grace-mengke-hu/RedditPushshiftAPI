The banana theory?

So iv been told by a ex smoker friend that if you have a really bad craving for a cigarette eat a banana. I was dumbfounded. So im trying it right now to see if this theory is true. This is day 1 attempt at quitting and im sitting were i normally have a cigarette but instead im eating a banana and posting for you guys.
Finished eating it. (Two minutes after:)
Well it did take my mind off of it but my problem is after i finish eating just about anything i would light up. The craving isnt as strong as it was, but i still want one. I am going to go take a bath and forget about the craving.

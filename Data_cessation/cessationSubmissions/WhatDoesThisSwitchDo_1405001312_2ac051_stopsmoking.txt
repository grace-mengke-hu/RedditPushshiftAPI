Nicotine Patch weaning/titration? Suggestions from former patch users greatly appreciated!

Currently I'm on the step2 (14mg/daily) patch. 

My plan is to step down to the 7mg patches as soon as this box of the 14mg/day patches is done, if not sooner...then to use the 7mg patches as soon as I wake up, but removing them earlier and earlier in the day. 

Currently I've been removing the patch right before bed, but last time I tried this (and managed to go 29? days smoke/nicotine replacement free before I f'd up and smoked when a pregnancy scare came into play) I was removing it it at 9pm vs 10pm...then 8pm, then 7pm, then 6pm, then 5pm the next week, and then I just stopped and stayed off for that 29ish days.

Just what my plan is. Anyone else using the patch have any suggestions on weaning/titration? Is my plan good in your eyes? Opinions/suggestions/anything are all acceptable! Seriously, any input would be great! I don't even care if you're nice about it as long as it's somewhat constructive!

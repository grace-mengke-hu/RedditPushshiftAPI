I've tried several times to quit and have never succeeded for more than a few weeks - until now. 3 weeks ago, I become a non-smoker. Here's how I know it will stick....

I'm in my early twenties, have an outdoors, hands-on job and I love smoking.

Every time I've tried to quit in the past, it's always been because I should. I've known for years that it's bad for me, expensive, anti-social etc and every so-often, enough people telling me those things enough times would convince me to have another crack at quitting - but it never stuck. Here was the problem: I enjoyed smoking too much! In fact, I enjoyed it right up to my last cigarette.

Here's what's changed. This time, I'm not quitting because I should: I'm quitting because I want to. After running some numbers, I realised smoking was costing me so much (over 5k NZD/year) that I had a choice between buying a house in 3 years' time, or smoking. I chose the former and have had a much easier time quitting than I ever have in the past, and I've got the right motivation and discipline to make it stick!

I guess what I'm trying to share here is that quitting smoking is much easier when you're doing it for your own reasons - not other people's. Best of luck! You can do it too!

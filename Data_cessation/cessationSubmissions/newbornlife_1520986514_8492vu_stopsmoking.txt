Anyone quitted nicotine completely (NO NRT) and gained some health benefits?

I quitted regular cigarette about 6 months last year and relapsed, I began to try quitting again at the beginning of this year and haven't smoked. 

But meanwhile, I have always been using e-cigarette during this quit time but right now it is really hard to quit e-cigarette. Usually, I am lacking both motivation and discipline when I try to quit nicotine because I keep reading the scientific articles that nicotine is not actually that bad, only slight risk of cardiovascular system such as caffeine.

Anyone noticed any beneficial health effect from completely quitting nicotine?

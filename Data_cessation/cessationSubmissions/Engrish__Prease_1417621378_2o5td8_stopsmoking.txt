100+ Days and feeling amazing

So I figured I'd check in on my 100th day but realized I'm a day late! My last updated mentioned that I would be running a 5k on Thanksgiving. Well I did and I crushed my goal of <30 minutes. Ran it in 27 minutes flat. 

I've got my sights set now on a 10k race that is happening on St. Patty's day weekend and a sprint length triathalon this summer. I was a competitive swimmer in HS and college but after graduation those things took a back seat to smoking. It feels amazing to be able to swim, bike and run now without feeling like death. :)

Stay strong guys!

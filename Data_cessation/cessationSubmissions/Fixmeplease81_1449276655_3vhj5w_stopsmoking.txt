Quitting for my kids

Ok so I have to quit, because my kids have already lost their Dad when the plane he was on was shot down around a year and a half ago.

I have depression, OCD, chronic nightmares and possible Bipolar II disorder so I have no fucking idea how I'm going to do this without becoming any crazier then I am already.

Thanks for reading.

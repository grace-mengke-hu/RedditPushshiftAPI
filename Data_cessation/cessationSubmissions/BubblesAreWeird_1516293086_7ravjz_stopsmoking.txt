Close to 6 months in and I feel worse physically.

**I want to make it clear that I do not want to start smoking again. It's just gonna make things worse and even though what I'm experiencing now is bad, smoking is not gonna be the answer.**

One of my main motivation to quitting was that I'll be able to get my stamina, sense of smell, and other things that people benefit from quitting.

Unfortunately I've noticed I haven't got these "benefits" apart from a few like the sense of smell.

I've noticed I've been having headaches more frequently, I get about two bad ones and a mild one every week. 

My immune system is horrible, at first I thought I wasn't eating right and it could be because I quit smoking but I get a cold and/or a sore throat every month.

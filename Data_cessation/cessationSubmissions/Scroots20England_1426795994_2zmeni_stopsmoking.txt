25 Days

Hi all, I have stopped for 25 long days now with the assistance of Champix. I must say it is the hardest thing I have ever had to do, and still is. I am determined to do this as my wife nor any of my closest friends smoke and although I used to enjoy a fag, I hated the taste in the mouth and also the smell on the clothes. 
I do however, feel depressed all the time, whether this is down to the Champix or the not smoking I'm not sure. I am told this will eventually improve and go away. I just can't see that at the moment and constantly think, oh I'll just start smoking again, however, I know this is just my mind playing tricks on me, something stops me from relapsing which is good. 
I don't seem to have cravings anymore, more thoughts, " you used to enjoy a fag, you have one on holiday while the wife is getting ready, what will you do now" this is making me not look forward to my holidays, which isn't till August !!!!! Will this eventually ease and go for good ?
I am determined to do it once and for all after 23 years smoking, any other tips would be greatly appreciated, many thanks.

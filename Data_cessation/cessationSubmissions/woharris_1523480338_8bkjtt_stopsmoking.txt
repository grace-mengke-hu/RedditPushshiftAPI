A message from your biggest supporter

If you are quitting today or thinking about quitting today, I am writing to tell you, YES YOU, that you can do this, and if you already ARE doing it, I am so proud of you. It gets easier. It gets better. Every day that you resist the urge to smoke you purge more of this nicotine poison from your veins, and you will begin to stop thinking about it, not completely forgotten, but definitely more "gone." I am am 37 days in, and I already feel like I've accomplished so much. Celebrate the small wins. I went through a breakup during my first 30 days of quitting. I celebrate the fact that I WON by not turning to smoking in that difficult time.  If you begin to falter, be inspired by the others on this page telling you that you can do it, they've made it 10 days, 30 days, 100 days, 1000 days, even decades, and you can do it too. Even if you've just made a mistake and picked up another cigarette, or bought another pack after being quit. GET BACK TO BEING QUIT! You can do it. I believe in you. Thank you for this page, you are all truly life-savers.

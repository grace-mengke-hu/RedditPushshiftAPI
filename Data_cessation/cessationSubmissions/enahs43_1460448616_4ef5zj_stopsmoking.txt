Quit now for 3 weeks!

Well I'm past the hard bit, reconciling to give it up in the first place and sticking at it, no matter what. So happy once again be a non-smoker. Just wanted to wish all the new quitters out there some supportive words; it really does get easier and you'll be so happy you did!!

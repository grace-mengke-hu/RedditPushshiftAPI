Nicotine patch dosage in Germany/on Amazon.de?

This is kind of a specific question, but I just moved to Switzerland from the US. Nicotine patches are expensive here, so I want to buy them from Amazon.de, but the doses seem way off - 52.5, 35 and 17.5 mg per day on Amazon.de (vs 21, 14, 7mg in the US).

Do these correspond? Like, is 52.5 really more than 2x as strong as the US patches (so I'd just buy 17.5 mg from Amazon.de), or is there some kind of difference that makes the 52.5mg Germany = 21 mg USA, etc? Thanks.

365 days and counting!

I smoked pretty much nonstop from 2001 until this day last year, by the end of it I was smoking 1.5 packs a day of American spirit's and hating my life. My Christmas present to myself last year was to quit, it was the best gift I've ever received. I just want to encourage everyone that it can be done!

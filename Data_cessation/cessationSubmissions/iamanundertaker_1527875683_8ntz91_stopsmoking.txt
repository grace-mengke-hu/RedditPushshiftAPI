Tell people you've quit.

I have quit smoking a few times. And every time I didn't tell many people about it. I was afraid that if I started smoking again, I'd be embarrassed. And I did start smoking again.

This time, I'm telling everyone I can. Not only does it make me less likely to start smoking again for fear of judgement, but their congratulations feel great.

I don't have an immediate desire to quit, but I know that I should. Need some advice please.

Hello. I have been smoking for 7 years now. A pack every 30 hours or so. It varies from day to day as my job can be extremely stressful or extremely laid back. I enjoy smoking, however I have started to feel the effects on my lungs and have noticed the smell on my clothes and breath more than before. It is not something I want to bring around my mom, as she disapproves of it (I live with my girlfriend in another state, but we visit her about once or twice a month). 

I guess what I'm really looking for is a starting point. I haven't looked into e-cigarettes that much, but I've heard some testimonials that may draw my attention to them more in the future. For now, can anyone offer me their story on how they first decided to quit and how they went about it? I'd appreciate it.

Thanks, and good luck to all who have decided to quit.

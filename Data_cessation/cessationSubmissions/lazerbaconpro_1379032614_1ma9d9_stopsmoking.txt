4 days of Camping/Gator Hunting.. DIDN'T SMOKE!

This was probably my toughest challenge.  When I am camping and out in the wild I would normally smoke twice the amount as normal.  I had a few cravings mostly because everyone I was with smokes like a chimney. But I knew it would taste horrible and not make my enjoy the trip more. Pack a day for 10 years.

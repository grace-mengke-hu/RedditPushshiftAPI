This evening is my day 1!

I have just finished reading Allen Carr’s book and smoked my last cigarette. I was coming to the end of the book this afternoon and considered stopping reading and finishing tomorrow, so I could have a final cigarette in the morning with my cuppa. Changed my mind and have decided to just go for it, I don’t need to smoke. So excited about what this will bring and to be free of addiction. I’m 28 and have been smoking since I was 15. I used to say I’d stop when I was 20! This will be the first time I’ve ever stopped without using NRT. I’m feeling tentatively hopeful this time is for real.

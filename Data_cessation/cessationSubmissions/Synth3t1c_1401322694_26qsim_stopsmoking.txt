I made it. 1000 days! Fuck Yea!

Well, here I am. I can't believe it. 

I look back at the past 1000 days and reflect upon the easy days and the hard days. 

Here are some posts during my struggle: 

* [First day of quitting](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/k2dbr/first_day_of_quitting/)
* [Day 4 Help?](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/k5aku/day_4_help/)
* [A week in, pretty depressed](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/k9yx5/a_week_in_pretty_depressed/)
* [11 days in and still craving hard](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/kdcta/11_days_in_still_craving_hard/)

We all start out with very bad days. Chemically, this is because while smoking our body only gives us serotonin when we smoke. So when we quit, it takes a while for the brain to reset. During this time, I got depressed. Real bad. I convinced myself after one month of trying to quit, I can smoke again. That got me through it.

Then I hit the month and reevaluated my position. I said, well, It's a bit better than it was, lets see how it is tomorrow. And the next day the same thing. Until I forgot about it completely.

I could NEVER have done this without Alan Carr. He helped me kick the habit. It didn't stick the first time I read the book - I only made it 25 hours. But the second time, a few months later, it stuck. But it didn't stick because I read the book it stuck because I wanted it. And when I want something, nothing should be able to stop me. My mind played a few tricks on me, but I was strong, never relapsing. You trained your mind to want something wrong, I had to retrain it. You can teach an old dog new tricks. Hell, you did it once...

But there was something much more important than Alan Carr. Sure, he gave me the techniques, but you, this subreddit, gave me the follow through. You, along with my real-life family and friends kept me in check. I told everyone I quit. I told them the day I quit that I quit. I went out drinking the next day, to a smokey bar. I had cravings, sure. But I had to get used to not giving in. If I can succeed in the hardest, smokiest bar, I can succeed anywhere.

Anyway, for anyone struggling, it gets easier. I was smoking something like 2 packs a day for six years. It doesn't matter if you've been smoking for 30 years, or 1 year - you can quit. I believe in you. I'm chasing the high scores in the mod box, y'all should chase with me!

As always, feel free to PM me for my info if you need a quit buddy. 

I'd say good luck, but it doesn't take luck. It takes perseverance.

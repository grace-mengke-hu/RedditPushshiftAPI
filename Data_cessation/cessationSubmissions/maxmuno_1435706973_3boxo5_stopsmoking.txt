I need your help. I'm 'scared'.

Aright. I'm 17. Ever since I started going to this full-time boarding military school, I started smoking. 

I smoke once a day. I always think that I can quit real easy, but that's bullshit. I try to quit, then I go out and my friends start smoking. There is too much temptation, it's like some sort of social 'tradition'. I don't even feel much guilt, I keep thinking that smoking once won't kill me. 

 How do I stop? I always find the dopest solutions to problems, apart from smoking... What would you do if you were in my situation?

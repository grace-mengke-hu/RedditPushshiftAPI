Sometimes I just need to remind myself why I'm quitting.

This is my craving distraction post......
I'm on the start of day 4 and I'm craving, so I guess everytime I have a strong craving, I'll turn here. I just want to remind myself why I am quitting....

1) I should have quit when I was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes almost 10 years ago. It would make managing it much easier

2) I'm sick of being short of breath and tired all day.

3) Just in the 3 days I quit, I put the $30 I would have spent on cigarettes in the savings account and boy, does it make a difference!

4) when my fianc√©e finally comes to the US with her kids, I don't want them to see me smoking. How can I justify telling my stepkids that they shouldn't smoke when I'm puffing like a chimney?

5) My clothes smell so much better....I smell sooo much better......everything smells so much better!

6) My boners are getting stronger ;)   

ok......that craving passed. Thanks reddit!!!

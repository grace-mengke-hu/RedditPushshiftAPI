I've smoked my last cigarette and I'm going to (attempt) to quit cold turkey.

Hey people, first time poster here so.sorry in advance.

I've been smoking daily for about 4 years now, I never attempted to quit before but I've been sick of it for a while. I'd appreciate any motivation/advice you've got to curve the cravings that aren't food (currently dieting because of health issues so I wouldn't want to substitute one for the other) also any little tips you could throw my way will be much appreciated. I'll update if anyone wants? Idk how this shit works

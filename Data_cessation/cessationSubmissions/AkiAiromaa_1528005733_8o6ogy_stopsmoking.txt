2 FUCKING MONTHS! I canâ€™t believe I did it cold turkey... I have cried, laughed, screamed, slept bad, held my breath when been in contact with smoke, almost relapsed, done roller skating like a mad man, used the app, been active on the forums, applied the 12 step recovery technique... BUT I DID IT!!

I don't really feel it anymore (badge is kinda misleading)

I was like 90 days quit or so, using a vape, down to almost no nicotine. Four days ago I cheated and smoked a cig for reasons, felt sick from it and guilty about it. So I reset my badge, went out to buy a new tank for my vape kit, and got cheated by my store, sold a defective part. Instead of fighting with them over the (fairly large) sum of money I spent there, I decided to man up and quit the vape, too.

Don't get me wrong, fellow vapers, I swear I wouldn't have made it without that thing. I know this sub has some mixed opinions on it, but I highly recommend it as a quitting tool.

That said, I'm just glad to be done with both. I expected it to be a real battle to fully quit, ESPECIALLY when I lapsed and smoked that real cig... but four days in, I realized... I don't even miss it.

Wow. Thanks, r/stopsmoking.

I have tried quitting for the last 3/4 months but I have failed.

I'm 23 and I started smoking when I was 15. I think about it and I feel so bad for knowing that I have messed with my health during the most important part of the body development. Anyways it's never too late to change and I'm committed to do it. 
I managed to go 5 days and when I relapsed I really hated myself. Today I smoked my last cigarette.
Wish me luck and feel free to share any advice to help me quit forever.

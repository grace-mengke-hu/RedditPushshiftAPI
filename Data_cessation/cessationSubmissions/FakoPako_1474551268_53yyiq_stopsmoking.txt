The longest New Year resolution I have ever kept

Damn, it's almost 9 months! That's crazy! I remember when my counter would say 5 days, 6 days, 7 days..then one week. But 9 months? It is awesome!

To those of you in your early stages. Keep at it. I promise you this is worth it. The cravings will go away and you will feel amazing! I can not think of smoking ever again. It makes me sick if I think of inhaling smoke. Sometimes I see people smoking in their cars and I think how stupid I was for doing the same. It stinks! It made me tired and grumpy! I do not plan my day around smoking any longer! I don't give a crap about having a full pack before I go somewhere. I don't need it! I smell great, my mouth and especially my gums and teeth feel soooooooo clean. No more ashes in the back seat of my car. My car smells nice now. 

Keep at it. You can do it. I smoked a pack a day for more than half of my life on this earth (23 years, I am 40 now) I still kick myself in the ass for even starting. But it's over now. I am free! You can be too! Stick to it. Everytime you think of smoking, really ask yourself and think about "What good does it do to me?".

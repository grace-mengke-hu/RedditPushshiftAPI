replacing the habit

I've been smoking consistently for 8 years now and I made my first real progression towards quitting last week. Last week was the first time in 8 years I was able to go 24 full hours without smoking.

To do that I had to put myself in a scenario where I couldn't stop to smoke (airports, meetings, crazy schedule). Obviously that's not something maintainable, so my my question for others who are trying to quit is: "How do you replace the habit?"

I've tried gum, nicotine gum, patches, meditation, running, etc... I just need something to do every hour or so that doesn't require continuous attention. (I typically smoke and read a newspaper article or take a walk around the building). I've had a buckeye for a while too, but rubbing a knot of wood really has no satisfaction for me :P

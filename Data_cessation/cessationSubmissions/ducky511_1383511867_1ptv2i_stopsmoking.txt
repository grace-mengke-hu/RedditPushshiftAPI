aaaaand I slipped

was strong for 8 days but after 2 city wide drink specials and a bit of stress from my phone service, email service, and house loan, I slipped. Only had one, bummed it off a guy on the street out side of the bar. Not happy with my self. I know I will never have "control" over my addiction. So this slip worries me. I had been doing better then I ever had been. After ten years I thought I was free-(ish?). I knew it was something I was going to have to watch for the rest of my life. And I just feel like an idiot for subcoming to it.

Not really sure what I am looking for hear. I just felt like I needed to own up to my indiscretion.

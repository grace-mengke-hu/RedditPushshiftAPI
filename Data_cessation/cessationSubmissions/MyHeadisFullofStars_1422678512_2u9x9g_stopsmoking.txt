27 hours in. Feels ok.

I'm proud for making it this far, coming from half a pack a day. I went cold turkey yesterday, don't see myself smoking again. I feel like absolute ass, though. I'm straight up angry at everything and I dunno what to do about it. I don't want to smoke, I just wanna stop feeling like ass.

anyway. good luck everyone.

I got up today and...

I thought "Something IS Missing" and knew what it was. Hmm, that's it. I never thought at all of a cigarette. I don't need or want any. I just thought, free of emotion, that this is what I never automatically thought of in the morning anymore.

I never even craved or triggered for a cigarette, just thought, that is what is missing and never missed it. Just noted it.

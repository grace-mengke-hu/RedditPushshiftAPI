3 weeks down!

I dont have one of those fancy apps to show you guys, but ive obstained from cigarettes for 3 weeks! Smoked for a little over 10 years, tried to quit just as many times, and i still have cravings. But Ive seen the long term effects with people in my family and I want to keep my teeth. I'm more determined than ever to quit for good.

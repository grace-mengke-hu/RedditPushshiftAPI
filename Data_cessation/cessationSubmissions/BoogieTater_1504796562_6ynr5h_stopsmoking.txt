Ready to get serious

Hello all! I've been smoking since middle school, I'm almost 24 now. The past year I've been trying to kick this habit really hard, especially since I have a kiddo and want to be around long term. I notice when I don't have smokes, I do pretty good. But when my DH comes home from work and steps out to smoke, I usually go out with him. I also know he has cigarettes so I know i can get them from him. He isn't keen on quitting, but I want to be able to  lead by example and hopefully be the inspiration he needs. 

I have zero self control it feels like. Smoking has been the "break" I give myself since I am a SAHM. It's a few minutes I have to step out and "reset" myself. I also use it to help revileve stress or frustration I'm feeling.  Any tips would be great on fighting temptation when your partner smokes or if anyone also stays at home and deals with needing a "break". 

I look forward to continuing reading the inspiring stories here!

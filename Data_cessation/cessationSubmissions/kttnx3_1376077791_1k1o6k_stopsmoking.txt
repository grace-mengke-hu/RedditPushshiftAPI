I'm doing it!

I just finished reading Allen Carr's Easyway to Quit Smoking! Let me tell you that last cigarette made me want to vomit. It's only been an hour but it's awesome to say fuck cigarettes! They have been disgusting to me for awhile and I'm soo soo freaking happy to be able to say I believe this time is this last time. I've tried to quit before but the book helped me realize why it as actually supposed to be easy and why previously it seemed so hard. 


Here's to more energy for my daughter, more confidence to say keep your stranger hands off her, better breathing, more money and the list could go on. 

I'm just so happy I could cry!

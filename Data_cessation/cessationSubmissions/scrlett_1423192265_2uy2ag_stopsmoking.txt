Really bad bloating/digestion issues after quitting?

Hi! I've been a 'light' smoker (1-4 rollies a day) for about 2 years now and quit 10 days ago.
I feel super excited about finally freeing myself however I've noticed since quitting I've been experiencing significant bloating and digestive issues (bad pain/chewbacca-esque gurgles) after eating. 
Is this normal? Seeing as it's been over a week I'm not sure if it would still be water retention or anything.

Btw I've been lurking this sub a while and glad to be among such a motivational bunch :)

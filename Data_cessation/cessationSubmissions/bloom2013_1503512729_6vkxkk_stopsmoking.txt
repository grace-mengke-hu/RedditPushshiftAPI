Help

I bought a cigarette off of someone. I'm having a really shitty day and I've been very close to lighting it and very close to tearing it to pieces, but inexplicably I haven't managed to do either. 

I know  -I really really do know- that this is bs... But my current trail of thought is that my life is in chaos right now, and quitting some other time will be easier. Please remind me how stupid this is.

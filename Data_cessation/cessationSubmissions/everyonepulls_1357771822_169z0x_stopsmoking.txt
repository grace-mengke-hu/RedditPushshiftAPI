Anyone here who was able to stop without withdrawls? How did you trick your mind?

I would love to stop cold turkey because I can´t afford to buy patches and relapse all the time (for those wondering: can´t afford patches but cigarettes? ---> Family with 3 smokers and I take from them) but everytime I tried I got restless and nervous. I know nicotine can be a bitch but I´m sure with the right mindtricks I can beat that bitch!
I currently don´t have time to read Allen Carrs book but if someone could sum up which points were the most helpful for them to trick your mind that would be really appreceated :)

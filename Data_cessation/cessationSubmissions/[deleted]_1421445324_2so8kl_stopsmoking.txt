Almost a Month

So its been almost a full month since I have quit smoking all together.

To be honest this is the most difficult thing I have ever done, and I survived Marine Corps boot camp for three months.

To be honest though I almost fell off the wagon, ever since I have quit I have been a lot worse to be around. I am very grumpy and recently I have had a tendency to be miserable and easily angered. My wife actually went out and bought a pack of cigarettes because she couldn't deal with it anymore. I feel really bad, I didn't realize it was affecting her so much. I stayed strong though and had her give the pack of cigarettes to one of her co-workers.

The bad mood's are basically gone now, I am cheering up and I am thinking about smoking a lot less. Its still really hard for me but I figured if I can go a month, I can go two months and so forth.

Thanks to this subreddit I was able to get support when I first started to quit and you prevented me from waffling on my promise to quit for good.

Thank you all.

Quit November 13th. Just drove 15 hours from CA to AZ &amp; didn’t relapse

Had to drive home for thanksgiving, Went to work from 7am-2pm and then left early to drive home, 3pm-6am after getting slammed by traffic. 

I can’t remember the last time I pulled an all-nighter without nicotine. There’s still a long road ahead of me—figuratively, because the family I’m coming home to smokes, and literally, because I still have to drive home again. 

But this is one of my biggest personal victories of the year and, for the first time in awhile, I feel like anything is possible

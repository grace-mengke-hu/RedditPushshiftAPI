Mood..

I've managed 3.5 days. 
Proud of myself but enraged at the world. 

Like seriously- politics, people at work, family, slow drivers, rudeness. 
 Things that tend to get on my nerves generally and I think I've been taking the edge off with various substances. For a long long time. 

I've also recently dumped booze and pot so I'm seeing the world with fresh clarity generally, and want to have a fresh start but a bit worried I might just be stuck at being very irritable, usually with some justification. 

It would in some ways make better sense to tackle vices individually but to me they are so closely interlinked it's much simpler to go cold turkey on them all. Booze 7 days in, pot 12 days.

Chantix unprovoked assault.

I was prescribed Chantix on 11/1/2017 by my primary care physician after first getting approval from my psychiatrist as I have bipolar and was taking other medication. 16 days later I was over a long time friends house for our weekly Friday chillax session where we vent out the events of the week as mutual sounding boards. I was sitting on the couch and he was going on about work, money and his upcoming wedding and all the stress he was feeling, a little loud and animated, but nothing outrageous. 

I was listening passively, just hearing what he was saying. No thoughts going through my head at all. Suddenly, without my knowing it was about to happen I punched him in the face breaking his jaw. He required 8 hours of surgery, a wired jaw and $32k of hospital bills. I'm big, 6'4 280 lb, I subdue aggressors but I've never struck anyone before, let alone a friend. I had no opportunity to intervene or stop myself, there was no indication. 

The drug insert says that if you have bipolar you should stop taking Chantix if you see any agitation or behavior that is not typical. Apparently, insufficient trials were done on certain demographics. Unfortunately, my first indication was breaking my friends jaw.

Slipped and does this mean I have to start the quit time over?

It's been 2m, 2d and I slipped today. I smoked and I'm so mad at myself. I don't want my friends or family to know.  I wish I could take it back.  Does this mean I have to start my timer over again? Is it ok to just let myself off the hook and keep looking at myself as a non-smoker. I don't plan to cheat again. I was doing so good... ugh.

I will not give up this time, I will quit and stay quit.

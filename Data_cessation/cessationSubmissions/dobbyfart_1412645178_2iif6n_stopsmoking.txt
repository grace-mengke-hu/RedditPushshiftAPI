Have found an interesting trigger

So I'm really sick for the first time since quitting. There is so much phlegm I'm thinking of converting it into heating fuel and becoming a millionaire once I patent that idea. I always hated smoking when I was sick but hating it didn't stop me. Why would not being able to breathe keep me from my favorite addiction?

Anyway, I have been craving cigarettes since getting sick. What the what right? But it kind of makes sense because it's about instant gratification and feeling some relief for about ten minutes. I refuse to give in, but I thought I'd share. You never know what will trigger you, so keep conscious of what you're feeling when the urge to smoke pops up. Why are you suddenly having that craving when you've been doing so well for so long? 

My apologies for glaring typos, I'm on my phone.

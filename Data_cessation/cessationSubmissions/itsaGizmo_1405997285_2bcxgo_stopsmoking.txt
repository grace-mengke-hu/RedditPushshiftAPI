Nicotine free for more than 24 hrs.

This is definitely an accomplishment for me. I am using champix and it is working well. I don't believe i have gone this long without some form of nicotine in more than 20 years. I am determined this time...I WILL QUIT SMOKING AND NEVER SMOKE AGAIN! I am doing this not just for my health but for my daughter. I plan on being around for her for a long time. Also, for the money....Fuck is it ever expensive to smoke.

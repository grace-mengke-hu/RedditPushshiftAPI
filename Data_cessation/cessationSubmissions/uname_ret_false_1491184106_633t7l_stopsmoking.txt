24 days! Just wanted to share it with you guys :)

It's been 24 days since i went cold turkey. I have been reading "Easy way to stop smoking" and everything in that book has made it so much easier to fight the cravings!
Anyone out here thinking about picking it up here is a phrase from the book 
"The only thing that persuades us to smoke in the first place is all the other people doing it. We feel
we are missing out. We work so hard to become hooked, yet nobody ever finds out what they have
been missing. But every time we see another smoker he reassures us that there must be something in
it, otherwise he wouldn't be doing it. Even when he has kicked the habit, the ex-smoker feels he is being
deprived when a smoker lights up at a party or other social function. He feels safe. He can have just
one. And, before he knows it, he is hooked again."

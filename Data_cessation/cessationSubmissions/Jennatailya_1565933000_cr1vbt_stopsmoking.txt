I’m ready to quit. Today is the day! How many have quit using Wellbutrin?

I’ve quit cold turkey more times than I can count but always go back. My doctor suggested to try Wellbutrin. I’ve heard stories of it working, increasing dopamine etc. I’d like to hear some success stories about it. I’ve been a smoker for 10 plus years and I still smoke less than a pack a day. So those that used Wellbutrin how did you do it? How did you feel? Any advice? Thanks

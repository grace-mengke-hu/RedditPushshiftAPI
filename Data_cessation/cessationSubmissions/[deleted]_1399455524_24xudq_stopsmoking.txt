Help a fellow redditor by answering three short questions on how you managed to quit smoking

Hello there! i'm a Nurse Student and I'd like to ask you three short and simple questions:

- In which ways has quitting made your life better?
- How long did it took you to get over the addiction?
- What was the hardest part of stopping smoking?

It's for a Physiology assignment and I'd really appreciate the help. I only need the input from three ex smokers, but any extra answers would be welcome!

Thanks in advance!

EDIT: added a p where it should b, thanks Serbrian :)

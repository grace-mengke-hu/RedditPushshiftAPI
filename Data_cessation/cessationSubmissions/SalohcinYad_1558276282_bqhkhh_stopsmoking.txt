Any advice


This was posted elseware but all relates to stopping smoking. 

About 4 years okay I had a small veritgo attack where I had to leave work and walk home ( yes I was able to walk, although looked drunk ) got home and this settled. A year after I started to feel uneasy on my feet which is made worse by getting up quickly, fast movements etc. Now in this whole time I have only ever experienced vertigo 3 times and each time it has been mild. But lately about a year and a half I have felt every day uneasy on my feet! I have been through loads of meds and doctors app. I've been told it's anxiety etc I've recently seen a ENT this is the second time and he has said he thinks it's Mineres but I just don't think it is! Yes I have lost some hearing in the left ear but we knew about this 5 years ago when I went and see an ENT for the first time. I think the hearing lost is from smoking, I have smoked for a long time now ( 14 years ) the more I look into it the more it seems like smoking has damaged my ears and is casuing this. It just seems like my symtoms don't add up with thoses of mineres. I hear high pitched ringing in my ears but again this can be brought on by smoking as it's proven to.  

So again a run down of my symtoyms, uneasy / unsteady on my feet especially when looking up or down, getting up fast or fast movements. 

Ringing in my ears mostly all the time, sometimes not at all and sometimes very quiet. 

Headaches. 

This is every day. 

And yes I know I need to stop smoking regardless. 

And thoughts would be appreciated

Also I've had blood test, MRI ecg

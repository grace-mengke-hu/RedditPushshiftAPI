Starting over

Because apparently I'm a self destructive piece of shit. Meh. I'm feeling pretty bad right now.. the worst part is I don't even want to smoke, like at all. I'm not sure why I even did. I think when things are going well I just need to find a way to mess it up. I told myself I wasn't going to do this whole "oh I quit for a few months but here I am again"... but well, here I am. There's nothing I miss about cigarettes and I feel weak and ashamed of myself for not being able to keep up with a simple promise to myself. Cigarettes are stupid. I'm stupid.  Blech. Sorry for the self loathing rant, just really disppointed in myself

Smoking pot after quitting

As my badge says I quit a couple of months ago. Since then I did not have one single puff. Until this weekend when I shared a marijuana cigarette with a friend.
The next day I dreamt that I was smoking. Today I had a couple of beers and now I crave cigarettes. Thank god no smoker is around me now.

I'm not going to smoke again but I'm wondering how do you guys manage to have 'fun' from time to time after quitting?

EDIT: There was tobacco in the weed.

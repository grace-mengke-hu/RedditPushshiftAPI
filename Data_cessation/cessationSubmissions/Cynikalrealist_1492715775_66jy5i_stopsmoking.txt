Secondhand withdrawals?

Hi Everyone! Hope you are all doing well in your quest to be smoke free. I recently passed 1000 days myself.

My friends who still smoke have a habit of going to bars where indoor smoking is permitted. I hate going, but every so often I do to catch up.

My question, for someone who may have an answer, is am I just tempting fate in this situation? I come home smelling like an ash tray, and two days later I'm feeling very agitated. 

Has anyone else had a similar experience? I'm asking because I have a few anxiety issues as well, so I'm trying to distinguish the difference.

Thanks in advance, and best wishes to all of you :)

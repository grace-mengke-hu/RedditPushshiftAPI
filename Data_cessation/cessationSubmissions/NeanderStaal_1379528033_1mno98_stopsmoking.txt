Keep it up, it just keeps getting easier!

September 3rd marked 4 years of not smoking, after something like eleven years of pack a day smoking. It's now gotten to the point where the cravings have disappeared entirely and the smell of smoke bothers me. There are heaps of people in my life now who never even knew I smoked. My wife can't even picture me as a smoker.

I'm happy. I quit cold turkey due to circumstances but had some success earlier with the patch. Do whatever you like, but quit and stay quit. If I can do it, so can you.

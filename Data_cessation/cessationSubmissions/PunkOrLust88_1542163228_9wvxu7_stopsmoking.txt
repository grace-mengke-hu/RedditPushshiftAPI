Wellbutrin

So I was recently prescribed Wellbutrin and was curious about othersâ€™ experiences with it.   Took the first 150 MG pill today and will continue to take one each day and was just wondering when I should stop smoking completely.   I know I should quit right this very second, but I also want to do it when enough Wellbutrin is already in my system so my quit can be successful and lasting.  Any help would be greatly appreciated, thanks guys!!

Please Stop Smoking

I'm posting this from a throwaway account. I'm a subscriber to /r/stopsmoking on my regular account and I have been clean since Monday and will be clean forever now. 

What changed for me? I got a call from my grandmother that my father is in the ICU at John Peter Smith in Fort Worth Texas. His blood oxygen level had dipped into the 60s, this with him on oxygen in his home. My dad is in his early 50s but had a three pack a day Marlborough Red habit. He quit before it was too late and is down to something like 20% lung capacity.  
   
So now he is in the ICU with my grandmother faithfully sitting by his side. From talking to the doctor it doesn't look good as he isn't improving and they will likely want to do a tracheotomy on Friday if he still can't breathe on his own. Which comes the hard part as at that time we will have a talk about quality of life and what he can expect. My father has said he doesn't want to live if he is going to have to be on a machine for the rest of his life  like that. He even had a living will done up but never had it notarized so I may have to fight with my Grandmother about his wishes and ending my own fathers life. This will be the second son she has had to watch die in that hospital and after this she will be all alone.  
   
So do yourself and your family a favor, stop now before it is too late. Don't make them go through the pain that will come if you don't.

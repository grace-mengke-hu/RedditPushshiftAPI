Altered perception of time when first quitting?

So yesterday was Day 1 for me. Some parts were easier than others, but I got through it. 
One thing I noticed that I don't remember from attempting to quit in the past is a slowed down perception of time. I remember laying in my bed, watching TV, and I'd look at the time every so often and think, "that's it? It's only..." It felt like time was passing so slowly. This even happened when I went to sleep. I'd wake up every so often, look at the time, and only like 20 minutes had passed (I thought it was much later), which wasn't necessarily a bad thing because it made it feel like I had longer to sleep.

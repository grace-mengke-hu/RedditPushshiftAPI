How do I get Nicotine Patches under PBS in Australia?

Hi guys, I've decided to have another go at quitting and in the past I have been most successful with patches. I have a slight dilemma in that I roll my own cigarettes and the cost of buying patches over the counter is only slightly less than what I spend on tobacco a week. I know it is stupid, but without the massive financial benefit of quitting I really struggle to get motivated. 

I have been doing some research and apparently patches are covered by the PBS in Australia - I wanted to ask if anyone has experience getting a prescription? Do I just see a GP and tell him I want to quit, or do they only give out prescriptions to long term smokers (I have only been smoking full time for 6 years), or those who have immediate health risks? 

Any answers appreciated and I apologize if this is a bit of a stupid question - I am fortunate enough to not have had much contact with Medicare so I am pretty oblivious to how it works.

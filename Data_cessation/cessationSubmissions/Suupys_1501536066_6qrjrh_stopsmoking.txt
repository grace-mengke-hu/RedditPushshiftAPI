100 fails but this 1 time im doing it

I realy wish that i would have never started smoking, but there is nothing i can do about that. And i know i need to stop now.
Hello everyone. My name is Kristaps. Yesterday i found about this amaizing group and after reading some posts i decided that this is the best time to stop smoking. I hope support of others ex smokers will help me.
I will try to post my results.
But i have one question. At the moment im in high seas working onboard cargo ship, so smoking is like everyday activity here. During workdays we have bunch of short smoke breaks witch i usualy spend in smoking room drinking coffe together with usual cigarettes together with other sailors. 
Can anyone suggest something that i can do to avoid smoking during this time because its when the cravings strike. Can i hang out with others in smoking area and just be strong or should i avoid that?

The very beginning

Today is my first no smoking day after 16 years of smoking. More correctly 23 hours passed since my last cigarette... and I just lit one up. I didn't smoke it, I just smelled the smoke.

It is weird how I get the need to taste the smoke in my mouth, feel like it would be easier for me if I was sitting in a room full of smoke. Anyone else gets this feeling?

This is the down part of the day...when it passes I know I will feel better...

From your experience, how much do withdrawal symptoms last? And what were they for you?

Why am I so afraid to think about myself as a non-smoker? As if I am about to lose something so valuable, it almost hurts... Is it possible that is just nicotine addiction speaking from me, or could it be something deeper? :(

Just comment anything, I need to stop my brain from going crazy...

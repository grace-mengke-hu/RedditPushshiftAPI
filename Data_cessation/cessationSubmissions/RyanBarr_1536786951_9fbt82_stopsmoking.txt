Was cleaning up after a party I had on the weekend and found a few smokes kicking around in the garage....

It took me about 5-10 minutes  of back and forth “maybe just one  puff “ before I actually tossed them in the garbage and poured water on them.. but I did it. Now I’m gonna go ride my Harley, Fuck smoking.

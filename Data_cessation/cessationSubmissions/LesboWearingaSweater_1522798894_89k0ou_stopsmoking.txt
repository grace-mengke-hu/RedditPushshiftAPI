Car rides

First off, all of you are an inspiration to me and I can’t wait to make an impact on my health. 

I have tried to quit several times, the longest being 6 months. I’ve been in a dilemma that I can’t seem to shake. I have been working  a job that requires a 1.5 hour commute and I always smoke in the car. Is there anything that you all can recommend to help car ride cravings?? Thanks again!

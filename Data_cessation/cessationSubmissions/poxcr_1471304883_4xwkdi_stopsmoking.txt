One year smoke free.

Greetings from rainy Costa Rica!

Today I am proudly celebrating my first year as a non smoker, although I did not expect such a great feeling of accomplishment. I'd like to thank every reddittor who extended a few encouraging words during this time. It really helped, and it will always be immensely appreciated.

For those out there considering quitting or just beginning their journey, do not fret, it is not as difficult as it seems. Try it out, there's absolutely nothing you'll be missing out as a non smoker.

Smoked since I was 13. I am now 29. I quit 10 days ago and feel fantastic.

Hello all--just a few words of encouragement for everyone trying to quit.  

I started smoking when I was just 13-years-old and my older brother would buy me cigarettes.  By the time I finished high school, I was smoking more than a pack a day.  I absolutely loved smoking.  I quit once for several months when I was in college, but fell off the wagon and have smoked 1/2-1 pack per day for the last 8+ years.

I have "wanted" to quit for a few months but never really put the time or energy into making a plan.  Finally, 10 or so days ago, I was at a wedding and saw some old friends.  When I excused myself to go and smoke, one of my friends said "Wow, you still smoke? You must really hate yourself."  That hit me like a ton of bricks.  I smoked that cigarette and a few more and resolved to never smoke again.  I bought the patch the following day and wore them for a few more days until I watched the Allen Carr video.  I have been off of nicotine since then and feel great.

So, who knows how long I can go without smoking--it's only been 10 days--but if I have made it this far, I can hopefully put the addiction away for good.  This subreddit has been a tremendous help and I wish you all the best of luck!

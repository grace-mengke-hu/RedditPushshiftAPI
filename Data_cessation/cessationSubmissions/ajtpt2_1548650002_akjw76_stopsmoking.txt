10 days and still have 3 left in the pack

I don't know if it's the Wellbutrin or what, but I have no desire, no craving.  And I didn't even realize I had 3 left in a pack from last Friday.  Normally I would obsess about how many I had left.  Feels too easy.  Kinda waiting for the other shoe to drop.

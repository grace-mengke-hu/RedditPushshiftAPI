Today is the day

It's been about 13 years since I started smoking. I was 16, and I wanted to quit at 22, but something happened and I'm 31, never made a full quit of more than 2 months. 
But fuck this shit. I'd rather breath then pretend that it "helps with my stress."
Thanks for letting me vent. Everyones post in this sub really has inspired me to do something. Thank you thank you thank you

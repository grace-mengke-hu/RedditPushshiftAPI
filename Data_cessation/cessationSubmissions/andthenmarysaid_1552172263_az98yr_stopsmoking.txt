8 days without smoking, still feeling awful

I quit with the assistance of Wellbutrin - 150mg the first week while still smoking, then increased to 300mg on quit day. I've had terrible insomnia ever since, constant nausea, no appetite at all, feel like total garbage. Does this sound familiar to anyone? Could this be from the quitting, or is it more likely the Wellbutrin? Either way how much longer is it going to last? I'm starting to go a little nuts...

Just had my last

I've tried quitting cold turkey before and it didn't work. I bought some patches and mini lozenges that are here now. I just finished the last cigarette of my last pack, and I'm going to put on my first patch tomorrow morning.

The manufacturer of the patches makes the lozenges too and they say they're safe to use together. I'm hoping the patches will help with over all and the lozenges will help with cravings. 

I hope it works this time.

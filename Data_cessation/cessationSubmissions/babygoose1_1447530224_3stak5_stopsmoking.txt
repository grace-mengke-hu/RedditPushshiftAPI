Just wondering if this happens to anyone else? [serious]

So whenever I've stopped smoking (multiple times) I've gotten serious dizzy spells that make me super nauseated to the point where I can't finish a meal. As soon as I smoke a cigarette it goes away. I was curious if this happens to other people?

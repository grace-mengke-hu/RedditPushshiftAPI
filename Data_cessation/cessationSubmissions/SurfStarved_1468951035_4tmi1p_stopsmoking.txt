28 Days...closing in on 1 month!

I am still using the Smoke Free App and my mission today was to tell someone or post something telling people where  I am with respect to being a non-smoker.  I am a pharmacist and yes I stinking knew better than to ever smoke but the irony is that I started smoking while in pharmacy school.  Anywho, I chose this site to share my progress mainly because most people don't know I used to be a smoker.  I lived a secret life. I showered every time I had smoked but needed to go out in public.  Nicotine was running my life.  I know this will be a life long battle but I feel that I have found enough support with the Smoke Free App along with this website to battle this addiction as it continues to rear it's ugly face.  I am proud to be in this group on non-smokers!

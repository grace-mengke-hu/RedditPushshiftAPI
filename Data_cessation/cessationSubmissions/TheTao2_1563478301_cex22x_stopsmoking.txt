Craving after the patch

So I was really proud of myself. This time around my quit went really well. I completed the 10 weeks of patches without any slips and not many bad days at all. Now a week after I finished the patches I am suddenly craving a smoke. I am not antsy or jittery just canâ€™t stop thinking about having a cigarette. I am not  really stressed or annoyed about anything just got that feeling of need. Is this normal? Do I need to use the patches longer?

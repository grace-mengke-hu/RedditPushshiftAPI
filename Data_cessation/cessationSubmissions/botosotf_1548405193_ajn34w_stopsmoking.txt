Hello again! No regrets! Only gains!

It only gets better. My last post on this subreddit was 6 years ago and I was on Day 3. 

Today, I'm on Day 2406.

It will work and trust your process but commit to your process. For me, I read [Alan Carr's Easy Way to Stop Smoking](https://www.amazon.com/Allen-Carrs-Easy-Stop-Smoking/dp/0615482155) and it really helped. Even if you're still smoking now, that's okay. The book actually prefers you read it while smoking but it can be read at anytime.

An easy read and it changed my outlook on life while giving me the mental framing and fortitude to break the cycle.

It's cliche but, if I can do, you can do it.

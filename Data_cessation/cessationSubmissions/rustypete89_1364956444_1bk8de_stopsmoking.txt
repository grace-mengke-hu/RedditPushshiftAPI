SIX MONTHS BABY

So I kinda stumbled into 6 months without realizing it. Crazy. I stopped checking on my badge regularly a while ago. It's been quite a trip. I first picked up smoking the summer before college, with cloves. Didn't take long until I was smoking lights, then Marlboro 27's. I always told myself, and my mother, that I'd quit by the time I graduated college. Well, rolling up on 5 years later I was still going strong at about half a pack a day. Back in August I told myself, it's do or die time, let's fucking do this. I started cutting back and picked up running to help with the cravings. Signed up for a free trial of an e-cigarette in September, used that for about 3 weeks, and on October 4th I smoked the last cigarette I'll ever buy. I still smoke spliffs on occasion, and every once in a while when I'm stressed and I've had a few drinks I'll bum a smoke from someone and smoke maybe half of it. But I don't buy packs anymore and tobacco is no longer even close to a major part of my life.  These days when I get bad cravings I chew toothpicks. Quitting led to my healthiest, most enjoyable winter in a long time. I was able to go snowboarding almost 30 times because my health kept up all winter when usually I get sick. I just went for my first run of the spring, 2.5 miles with some hills mixed in, and it felt GREAT!

REDDIT I'M SO FUCKING HAPPY I QUIT AND YOU CAN TOO!!! WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!

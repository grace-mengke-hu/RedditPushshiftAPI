Are There Any Quit Smoking Telegram Groups or Similar Chat Rooms?

I'm on day 3 of quitting. I am using patches which are helping quite a bit. I use the gum as well when I'm about to break. I have read many times that the cravings get worse before they get better (typically around the day 3 mark).

I could really use some support. To bitch, to commiserate, to share victories, to support others and to be supported. I don't mind using Reddit, but the more-instant gratification of an active chatroom would be preferable in times where breaking is an imminent threat.

I tried Googling, but had no luck. Does anyone know of any quit smoking chatrooms on Telegram?

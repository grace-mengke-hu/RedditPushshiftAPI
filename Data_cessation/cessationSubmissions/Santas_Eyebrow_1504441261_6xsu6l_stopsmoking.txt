27 Years

After 27 years of daily, pack-a-day smoking, I woke up yesterday and decided to quit. Sure I've thought of it but never seriously. Yesterday was the day, I guess. 

First, I smoked all the long butts in the ashtrays. 

Then I smoked the short butts. You know, the naaasty ones. 

Then I went to bed and slept for 12 hours.  I haven't touched a cigarette in about 14 hours. The store is a 30 second ride away. That's the hardest part. The availability.

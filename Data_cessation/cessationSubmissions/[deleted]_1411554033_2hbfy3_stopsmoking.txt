Feeling weak...

I quit on September 1st, right before school started. The first few days were tough, especially when around friends I used to smoke with.

Drinking was torture without cigarettes. I had associated them both with each other so much that I used to walk a mile and a half to get cigarettes sometimes when I drank while living on campus.

Anyway, everything got easier with time. I don't crave cigarettes nearly as much as I used to when I drink. I don't let my friends peer pressure me. I've stopped letting people smoke in my car, etc. 

The thing is, I'm under a significant amount of stress this week and every time I go to the corner store to get a cup of coffee my eyes are glued to the cartons of cigarettes behind the clerk. I'm not going to lie, I almost just bought a pack an hour ago.

I guess I'm not really looking for advice, I know what I have to do. I'm just sharing this because I know talking with people who understand makes quitting anything a lot easier. I also thought it might help those who are also struggling.

Thanks for reading.

Need some advice/help please.

I think im going on three years in April. Ive actually lost count how long it's been, I know it's been over two years so pretty sure im coming up on three. Ill make this as short as possible.

I need advice on how to control my anger/temper/anxiety levels. Im very close to starting back up again. I haven't found a way to manage my temper/anger/anxiety levels. In the past while at work I would go outside and smoke and whatever was bothering me would be gone by the time I got back to my office chair. I moved into a very high stress job early last year and have been struggling ever since. I really really need to find a way to cope without turning to smoking as I know the real reason I was able to calm down was that I left my work situation temporarily, not the actual smoking. I've tried the whole "Get up and go for a walk" routine but honestly without craving something it's hard for me to gauge the time ive been sitting working and also hard for me to gauge when i need to go for a walk. In the past I would recognize I was anxious and just go smoke. How can I set a bar for myself to know when my boiling point is? 

Im in the middle of a pretty shitty divorce, my grandfather just passed away and I just got written up today at work for my repeated F bombs, nasty comments I make (to myself) and generally being an asshole. I really need this to change as it's impacting my life in a very negative way. 

Can someone please give me some advice, anything, im desperate.

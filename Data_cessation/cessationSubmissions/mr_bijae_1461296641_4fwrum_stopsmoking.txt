To those of you beginning your journey...

Everything people say is true! The good, the bad, the ugly, the emotional shit you bring up by quitting smoking. It's all true! I am sorry to be the bearer of bad news. However, before you sigh and say there's no hope...

Every negative you have to endure to break the drugs addiction on you will be greeted with your own sweet reward. I cannot promise you Euphoria on week three or no urges on month eight. I would love to give you wave of a magic wand and wish you sell from here. I can't. Your journey is your own path. 

What i can say is I never thought I would be where I am today in my life. I never thought I would be able to break the addiction. It was not easy. I stayed in this sub frequently in those first few weeks. The advice you receive here will encourage you, some time discourage you, and some time frighten. This community is built to support you on a journey we have all taken before. I encourage you to stay on your path and slay the dragons of craving one by one. Soon you'll be known as the slayer and the dragons won't come around any more. 

Be Wild, Be Free (of nicotine)!

Congratulations on your success. You're here today reading this post, and that's a success!

Cheers!

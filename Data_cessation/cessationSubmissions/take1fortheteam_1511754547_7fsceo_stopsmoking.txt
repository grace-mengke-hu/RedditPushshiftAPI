Suddenly: Vape!

TL;DR: I started vaping because a friend suggested it as an alternative and I quit smoking since. The key moment was when I had to wait until the urge to smoke was extreme until I could actually use the vape and that single moment was so strong, I don't see myself smoking again.

Alright so a quick tip for some who just can't stop, like I couldn't.

I tried with gum. Failed.
I tried cold turkey. Failed
I had tried with vaping previously, but it was a cheap vape and apparently wasn't even working properly (didn't realize this at the time). Failed.

Recently a friend bought a vape and ended up quitting cold turkey for a month straight. I decided to give it a shot. I had three cigs left in my pack and I swore they would be my last.

I decided to meet up with the guy and my friend to buy a vape. We talked for a bit and I picked a model. I bought the vape, and the guy spent like 3 hours telling me about how it works, troubleshooting, what to use, charging, mixing liquids, the works.

By the end of the lecture I was itching for a smoke. 

The urge was strong as hell, but I grabbed the vape instead, and gave it a few puffs.

Urge was gone. Didn't even feel like smoking. The flavor was similar, the exhaled "smoke" (vapor) was similar, and the nicotine rush was just right.

I kept the pack with three cigs left for about a week and ended up throwing them away.

Haven't smoked since.

What I want to tell people who just can't quit is to try vaping, but when you buy your vape, don't try it until you have a really strong urge to smoke. Once it gets to be too much to handle go ahead and vape. You'll see that those incredible urges can be dealt with. At least it worked for me. I'm 12 days in and I don't see cigs in my future anymore.

Sorry for any bad english, been out of the states for about a decade.

I really hope this helps at least 1 person quit.

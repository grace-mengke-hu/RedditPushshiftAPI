7mths smoke free

And with all the stress this past few weeks and to be honest... none of my friends respect i've quit and will blow it in my face...

My weakness is tailormaids. Remembering they were a treat when it came to smoking. Seeing someone smoke one... the craving to have one rises more than someone just smoking rollies.

I was stuck in a room with 3 people smoking the other day and the urge to give in has never been that high. I left. Took some fresh air. To be honest it wasn't just the smoking that was a factor in the sudden urge to give in. But the stress. Ive been under alot the past few weeks and that moment alone was frustrating. 

I just am glad i was able to walk out and not give in.

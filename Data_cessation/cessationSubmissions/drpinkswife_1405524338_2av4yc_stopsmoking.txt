Change of Thought...

Patients always ask my age. I tell them and they say something like...'when you get to be my age blah blah blah'. And my first thought is, *and I never say this*, 'I won't ever get to your age'.

Today, I thought to myself for the very first time...'I might actually'.

I can't explain it well enough, but it was a **wow** moment.

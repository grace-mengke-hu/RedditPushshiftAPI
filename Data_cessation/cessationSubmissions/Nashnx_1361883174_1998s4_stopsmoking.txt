Day 1 hour 1

Tonight I'm having my last smoke. I've been hoping to quit slowly by keeping myself busy, not over stuffing myself when I eat, and dropping $50 on a veggie glycerin based e-cigarette. I've used the e-cigarette already, with medium nicotine. Here I am now, laying in bed with insomnia, hungry (poor college student) and ready to get a few hours of shut eye before school. 
Backstory: When I was 14, I started smoking. I did it because I was pissed at my mother for pushing over the line with me, lit up one of her cigarette butts then called a friend to come pick me up for the night. I regret starting completely.
All my life I've been around my smoker parents. Both my mom and dad started when they were young, and didn't even quit while pregnant with my older sister and I. 
I'm 21 now, weighing at 115lbs. I've taken 2 1yr breaks since I started. I'm as healthy as a horse even though I sit at home in my free time(when I'm not at school). The doctors are even baffled that my blood pressure and my lungs are all about average for my age. 
I was a pack a day smoker. I guess I've just grown tired of going out in the cold, or smelling gross after coming from a cigarette that I feel the need to shower. 
I already stopped smoking inside. I adopted a beautiful tabby/tortoise shell mix that when she came home with me that faithful Monday, I haven't lit a single cigarette inside. (Since end of Jan 2013)

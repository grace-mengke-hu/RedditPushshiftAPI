The force is strong

Had a good success last night when I was at a bonfire party with a group of friends, many of whom are smokers. They were sharin' smokes + spliffs and  I was drinking but I stayed smoked free! :)

Gatherings like this are my biggest risk for relapse and it was nice to see how easy it was to maintain.

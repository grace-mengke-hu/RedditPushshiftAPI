A few victories rolled into one...

I have a few triggers: alcohol (whiskey, especially), coffee, driving, and social gatherings. Last night at the bar I marinated my stomach with whiskey, and sat at a table with smokers for NYE. And...I passed. Through it all for a period of over 3 hours, I sat in a cloud of foul, shitty air and was content to drink and chat with friends about anything and everything. I mentioned once that I'd been smoke-free for almost 3 months and left it at that. No pats on the back except from myself in the taxi ride home for not letting curiosity kill the cat.

As I mentioned earlier, I have a few triggers and when I smoke, I end up going full throttle. One of my wiser friends once called smoking "the occasional treat for every occasion." That's how I smoked. It feels great to be free and easy and to know that the smell in my clothes from last night is easier to wash out than the guilt I'd feel if I lit up with everyone else.

A special thanks to this subreddit for helping me keep myself in check. Happy New Year's indeed!

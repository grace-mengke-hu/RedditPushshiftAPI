Im having a problem quitting

Hi everyone, first off english is not my first language so excuse if I have any mistakes.

I am a student and have been smoking for a little over a year a pack a day or more (First lucky strikes and now marlboros) and right now I am trying to quit. 

My family doesn’t know I smoke because I live 500 km away and don’t go there as much so they have no clue. Over here I smoke a lot, like I can smoke 10 cigarettes in a sitting at a cafe for an hour and a half. 

I have tried looking for nicotine patches and what not but they aren’t sold over here. Does anyone have any ideas or tips on how I can quit? 

Thanks a lot!

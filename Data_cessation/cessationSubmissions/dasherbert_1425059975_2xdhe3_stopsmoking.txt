Focus!

Oh my God. How sharp is my frikkin brain now I've stopped smoking. My sense of reasoning and organization has doubled in 8 days! That's all for now. Coughing loads. Not out of breath doing anything... And yes ladies, I mean anything.   Very impressive. What was I faffing about smoking for?

But yeah... As I was saying FOCUS! SHARP AS A TACK NOW. Thanks for this support dudes

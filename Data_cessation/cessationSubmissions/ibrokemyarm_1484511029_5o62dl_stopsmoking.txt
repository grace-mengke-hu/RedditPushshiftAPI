My boyfriend and I want to quit smoking. How can I help him?

So my boyfriend of a few months has been smoking for around 8 years or so, I've started again since I've been with him, but only really when I see him and I can go days without, so I'm not too worried about me. We've promised to stop smoking when he has holiday off from work next month, as he says it will be easier to get through the first few days if he's not stressed from work. 

I really want to help him, as I know he wants to quit, but he's thoroughly addicted and I know he'll find it hard. 

Is there anything I can do to help him? Or has anyone got any tips?

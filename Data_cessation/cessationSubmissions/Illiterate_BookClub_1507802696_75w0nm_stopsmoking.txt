What to expect in the first few weeks?

been planning to quit for a while. dont really want to right now tbh but i know longterm i need to. yesterday was the day, went about 7 hours then started to get pretty irritable and restless, caved and bought a pack. my dilemma is i dont want to be an asshole and unhappy to people around me, but thats probably just gonna be part of it right? will there be a top off point after a month or something where it starts to balance back or will it take longer?
trying again today.

I quit smoking cigs - day 3th

So I been trying to quit smoking weed and nicotine like 2 years. I did had times that I didn't smoke cigs. But not more then a 3 days..

 
Today mark day 3th I guess.


I will do a week of non smoking and see how I did


I stop smoking cigs but not weed. 


For sure I wake up more earlier then before, feeling overall good, not that weed not doing his part.


One day at a time

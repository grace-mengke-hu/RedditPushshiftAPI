Dream Issues.

It's day 103 for me and I feel like a real non-smoker now. The only remnant of the quitting process I have yet to overcome is the dreaming. I KEEP having these dreams where I take up smoking again, then get mad at myself. In fact, I wake up angry. It takes me a while to realize that my relapse never really happened. Anyone else go through this?

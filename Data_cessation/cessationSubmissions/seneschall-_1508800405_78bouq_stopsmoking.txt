Two weeks in, the longest I've ever gone in over 25 years.

Just dropped the patch now.  I used the patch since starting, and now I'm simply on gum IF I NEED IT.  And so far, since last night (morning as of this post), I haven't needed one.

So far so good!  My wife is quite happy, and so is my 5yo.  Though in all honesty, I didn't do it for them.  I did it for me.

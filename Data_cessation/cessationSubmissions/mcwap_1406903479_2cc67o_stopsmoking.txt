on my third day...

So as the title say, I am on my third day of not smoking... The best thing so far is that I no longer feel anxious walking into stores!  I walked into the bank to deposit a check and I didn't have the normal anxiety of worrying if people think I smell horrible.  I don't have to smoke then shower so the girlfriend doesn't know... much simpler to just not smoke!

Furthermore, I live in Memphis, so I didn't have to step outside and get devoured by mosquitoes just so I could have a cigarette!

I vacuumed out my car and there are no ashes slowly accumulating on the floor or int he door handle.

I take out 10 dollars a day that would've been cigarette money and put it in a small jar to save up.

TL;DR- damn it feels good to be a non-smoker for a change

How can I alter my quitting routine for vaping?

I started smoking when I was 16, was introduced to vaping 2 years in and now I’ve been addicted to the lil bastard. I’ll go a day without using them and then some stressor will come up and I go buy more pods. Idk how to quit this little guy since it’s so easy to hit it. Are there any apps that cater to quitting vaping?

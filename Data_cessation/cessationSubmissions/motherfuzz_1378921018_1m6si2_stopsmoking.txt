9 Days In... This is usually when I hit the breaking point...

Hey Guys,
I'm 9 days into this, which is longer than the last few times I've tried to quit, but usually things fall apart for me around here. I've been really good so far and haven't relapsed once. I am definitely having some major cravings though, and I'm just looking for some advice on how to power through these. I've been chewing on straws and eating sun-flower seeds, but it's not really cutting it at the moment. I know people suggest exercise, but I'm at work and can't really leave to hit a gym... Anyone else have any little tips or tricks that got them through those Week 2-3 moments?

The Rage.

I was always one of those people that said 'I'm not addicted to cigarettes, I just love smoking'  

Well in the last month I have been really doing some soul searching. and let me tell you. I WAS addicted to cigarettes, I DO have withdrawal symptoms. (I could always go 2 days w/o and smoke and be completely fine, as long as I wasn't thinking about it)

I am completely irritable right now, and for the first time ever, I have the feeling of 'I NEED A SMOKE, NOW'

Stay strong my friends. Even after saying all that. Shit aint worth it. Gross people smoke. Very rarely do you ever meet someone and think 'Man, I really look up to that guy over there smoking a cigarette'

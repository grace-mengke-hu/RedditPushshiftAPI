a unexpected side effect

I've been noticing how depressed I've been lately.  I've dealt with ups and downs since my early teens but this is something intense...and for the first time in almost 10 years I've had anxiety so bad that I woke up this morning unable to chew..I'm guessing from clinching my teeth.  I did some reading and there is a theory that one of the 100's of chemicals in cigarettes is a antidepressant. So... since I quit smoking...and have some very big stress factors on my shoulders it seems I'm being crushed...at least that is how it feels. 

Anyone else have unexpected side effect you would like to share?

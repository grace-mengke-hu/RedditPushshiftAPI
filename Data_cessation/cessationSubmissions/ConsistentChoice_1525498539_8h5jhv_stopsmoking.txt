I simply cannot stop

I read Allen Carrs book. I was excited and wanted to quit. I kept smoking nonetheless.

I watched his video seminar. I was excited and wanted to quit. I just smoked a cigarette.

I understand all his point. Right now I don't feel any better. If anything that cigarette made me even more nervous. But all I can think about is "I want a cigarette. I want a cigarette." How can I realize that the cigarette is creating that problem in the first place and that it's doing nothing for me at all and still have that urge? I simply do not understand it! I don't get what I'm doing wrong. I'm at a complete loss and can't imagine ever not craving a cigarette. I KNOW for a fact that without cigarettes my life would be so, so much better. And still I want one. I really don't know what to do anymore. I really need help.

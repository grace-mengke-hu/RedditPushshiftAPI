On day ten of being smoke free (but using NRT)

Hey there, 

I'm on my tenth day of being smoke free after 22 years of smoking fairly heavily.  I started when I was pretty young and decided that I wanted to stop for good before my 35th birthday.  I am an active person and have been training hard in the gym to help the quit.  I am also using a nicotrol inhaler when I have really strong urges/cravings.  It's helping a lot, but  I still feel very irritable and depressed.  I am also extremely tired at strange times throughout the day.  I become really tired during exercise sessions...   My question is, if I am using the nicotrol inhaler, am I still going through withdrawal essentially so that is why I feel so bad all of the time?  Will the depression eventually lift?  I am battling a lot in my mind right now...

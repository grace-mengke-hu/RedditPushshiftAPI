Favorite/fun quotes that help you?

I don't know if anyone else has a quote or line from a movie or anything they refer back to during hard times, but I often find myself thinking about this line from Harry Potter: 

"I remember only forcing myself, sleeplessly, endlessly, second by second, to
exist." 

Anyone else?

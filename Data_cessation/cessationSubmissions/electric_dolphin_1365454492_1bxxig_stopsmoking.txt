I'm a wuss...

I'd like to quit. I've been smoking technically for about a year, though not regularly enough to become addicted until around last summer. So I've been smoking between 2 and 6 cigs daily (maybe a couple days here and there where I didn't because I was too poor to afford a new pack - college student haha) for an estimated 6-8 months.

I've tried to quit a few times, and even gotten over the physiological need for one, but I keep going back because I still enjoy smoking and the social aspect of it. When I have tried to quit recently, I'll make it til the end of the day and want to punch someone in the face, so I go and buy a new pack.

I'm just wondering how difficult it'll really be to fully quit at the point I'm at, since I haven't been smoking very long compared to others. How many days will it take until my body doesn't get the urge for nicotine anymore? Any tips or recommendations? I'm thinking I'll start trying to wean myself off instead of cold turkey. Try to get down to 1 a day then just stop after that hopefully.

Thanks for any help.

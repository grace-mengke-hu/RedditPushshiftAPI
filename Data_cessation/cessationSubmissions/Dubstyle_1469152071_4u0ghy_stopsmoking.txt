One Year

I have managed to go one year without a cigarette and it feels so good. I am a little late to this post, but I am glad to have been apart of this community for the time I was trying to quit. I no longer am trying anymore, I don't need to :)

To everyone who is struggling, keep trying. You may cave here and there but the end goal will forever be the same. I found drinking a lot more water helps, but that's just me. Good luck fellow non-smokers.

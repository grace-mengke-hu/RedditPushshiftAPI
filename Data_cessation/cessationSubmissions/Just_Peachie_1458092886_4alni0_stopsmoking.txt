I feel awful... Quit for over a year and picked it back up...

I'm guilt ridden right now. I've been hiding it from everyone, even my live in boyfriend.

I was over it. Done for a year and I bought a pack last week, gave half of it away... then bought another one this week. I don't know why I picked it back up... Except that's denial.

I'm stressed out. I'm a manager at my job now and some of the employees drive me up the wall. I like the calm it gives me at the end of the night. My boyfriend stresses me out, so I feel like I need to be relaxed before I walk in the door, or I'm gonna be grouchy. I'm starting on my 4 year degree in a couple months after getting my associates. I feel a little lost in life, like I'm behind the rest. I'm 29, been married and divorced. No kids. Working in fast food through my college education.

I KNOW its bad for me. I'm going into a health field.

I guess I just need another way to de-stress myself when I'm getting wrung out.

Stress smokers, what have you done to find your calm after(or sometimes during) a difficult day? What do you do to quell the nerves that isn't nicotine?

Right now I'm only around 3-4 a day. When I smoked a year ago, it was 8 or 10.

I CAN quit. I know because I've done it. Twice. But I can't seem to kick this vice for good. :(

10 days ago, i joined NoFap again after 5 months, today i am joining StopSmoking as well. Need your help.

I realized i had to get my shit together like 10-15 days ago and joined NoFap again, even though i had too much free time because of that, i still haven't found the motivation to do anything in that free time.

I guess my lack of motivation and lethargy are because of smoking. I always tell myself, "when i am psychologically stable again, i will quit smoking." but i found myself in an endless circle. Now i am done fooling myself and oficially need help. 

I'm 23 y/o male and been smoking for 3 years. I graduated from university so i have to get my shit together as soon as possible. Quitting pmo is easier for me but i can't help myself from smoking. I am open to any advice, please help beautiful people.

Thanks for reading this far.

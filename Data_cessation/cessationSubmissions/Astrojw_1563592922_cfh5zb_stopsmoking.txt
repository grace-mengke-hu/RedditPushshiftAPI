Quit Vaping 3 Months Ago having chest tightness

I vaped on and off for roughly 2 years ranging from a e-cigarette or a bigger box vape. I quit 3 months ago, and I’m going strong because of everyone in this sub being so motivating. 

Except after quitting I’ve been having some other health complications such as high blood pressure and most recently chest tightness. I’m a 20 yr old male in decent shape. I am just curious if anyone else has experienced this sort of thing after they quit smoking and if they can help me understand what is going on.

Thank you everyone. I truly do appreciate any responses.

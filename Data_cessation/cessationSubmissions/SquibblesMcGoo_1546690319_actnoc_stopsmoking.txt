Day 5, things are starting to get easier

I think I'm over the worst. Day two and three were horrible. Now when I get the urge to smoke, I just go to the balcony for a couple of minutes to sit and do some deep breathing, most of the time it wasn't a cigarette I wanted, it was fresh air and a break from whatever I was doing. I don't feel as depressed and anxious anymore.

I vape once a day, take about 3-5 puffs before bed because I have chronic insomnia and I don't want to sabotage the rest of my efforts by not being able to sleep because of no nicotine, which would cause my depression and anxiety to spike because of the lack of sleep. I'm planning to leave that out as well after I hit the two week mark and my body is mostly used to functioning without nicotine.

I got this. Just need to keep going.

Day one.

Today I woke up, grabbed my tobacco, rolling papers, pipe, and lighter, and chucked them in a desk drawer that I never use.  
Including time slept, it's been eleven hours since I last smoked and I can already feel the craving kicking in.  
I know from past attempts to stop that without help, I'll turn into Mr. Scrooge times ten.  

So I ask you: What are some of the best ways to alleviate the increased irritability?

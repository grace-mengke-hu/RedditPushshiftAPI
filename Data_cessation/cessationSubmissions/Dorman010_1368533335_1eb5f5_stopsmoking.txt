8 months now.

Man, I feel amazing. I can smell and breath so much easier. When I see my brother going for a cigarette, I don't have any urges to smoke. I can sit there, let the smoke blow on my face, and not give a single fuck.

I don't cough even half as often as I used to when I smoked. When I do, there is no tar in my windpipe - it's an easy, non-painful cough.

I used to smoke 3/4 of a pack per day. My father used to smoke when I was a kid, and a lot of my family smokes. Both my father and I quit (he quit over a decade ago).

I did this. You can do this. 

It's worth it.

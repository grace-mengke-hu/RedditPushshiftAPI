How am I going to do this?

I am trying so hard but keep failing.  
I quit smoking for 5 years, started running.  Then life got real shitty, and I started again.  
I got into a relationship with a man who also smokes, we’ve been together for 2 years but have known each other for 10. I thought I was stronger and that I could quit despite his smoking.  We moved in together.  I love our life together and I love him immensely, leaving him is not an option. I have tried so many times to quit but I need a plan!  Does anyone have any suggestions on quitting with a SO who isn’t?  I feel like if I can just get away from it for a month or so, I can continue NOT smoking.  I just don’t even know where to begin with how to approach it.

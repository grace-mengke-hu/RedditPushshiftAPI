Phantom cigarette smoke...

Anyone else getting the occasional half a whiff of fag smoke that doesnâ€™t exist? The brainâ€™s a funny thing eh? Only occasional but I think I smell it n then itâ€™s gone. Iâ€™m on day 7 and descending into madness. I know itâ€™s temporary but Iâ€™m actually quite enjoying it! ðŸ˜ƒ Today I have been mostly enjoying a mild disassociative &amp; hypnotic daze- a bit like Iâ€™m not quite â€˜inâ€™ my body. Gotta say, itâ€™s not unpleasant.

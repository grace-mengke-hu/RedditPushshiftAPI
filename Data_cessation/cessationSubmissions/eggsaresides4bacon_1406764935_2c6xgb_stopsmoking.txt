Only been smoking for a few months but I want to quit now before it's to late

This is my second day without a cigarette.  Would of been my 5th day but I went to a party and my friend offered me some and drunk me loves cigarettes. I also need to quit soon because I'm leaving for navy bootcamp in a week so looks like I have to quit no matter what. Just looking for tips to make it easier. Thanks

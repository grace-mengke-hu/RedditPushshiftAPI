Two weeks clean cold turkey but I feel terrible. Anxiety is overwhelming. Help?

Title.   Two weeks, anxiety is killing me.  Work is always a challenge but the thought of anything but my couch almost puts me in convulsions... Is this an underlying anxiety disorder or a normal (semi-normal?) part of quitting?  Any help appreciated.

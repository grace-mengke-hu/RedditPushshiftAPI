The morning cigarette. 

Out of all the cigarettes I smoke in the day, the morning cigarette is the only one I don't think too much about. Its automatic and I simply feel I need to have it before I start my day. Ive made the decision to quit tonight, but I know how mindless I am with this first cigarette, and I know I won't quit without getting past not smoking it. Anyone have any advice or similar problems when trying to quit ?

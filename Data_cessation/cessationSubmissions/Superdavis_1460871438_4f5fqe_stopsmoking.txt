I love you guys.

I just wanted to say what a great sub this is and how helpful reading everyone's stories/advice was for me when I decided enough was enough. I was most worried about what I'd do after a few drinks, but thanks to you guys and Allan Carr I've got nothing to worry about. Kinda drunk now and I have zero desire to smoke. Best wishes after 629 days to everyone just stopping. You can do it and you've got nothing to lose.

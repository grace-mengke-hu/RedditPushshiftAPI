7 days ago I found out I was going to be an uncle 7 days with out smoking.

I had quit drinking four months ago  and genuinely didn't want to quit smoking(after three years of a pack a day it was my last  "being bad outlet"). My sister called me as I was taking my dog on a walk and told me I was going to be an uncle. Something clicked. I started to sob and stomped out my cigarette threw away the pack of southern cuts in a neighbor's trashcan. I put a post-it note in my car that reads: "I want to be a role model more than I want a cigarette." 

Every time I think about a cigarette I think "I want to be a role model more than I want a cigarette" and then pump out 10 push-ups. Since being sober I've made a point to make my weakness be my strengths.  When I find myself becoming irritable I take a step back apologize if I was a jerk and remind myself "this is a choice I want to make".  My lungs are still a little wheezy but 7 days with out a cigarette and I PRd 25 miles. 

I am proud of who I am today. I will be proud again of who I am tomorrow.

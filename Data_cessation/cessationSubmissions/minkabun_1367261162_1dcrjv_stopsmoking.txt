Today is Day 1 and I am very apprehensive.

I do not think I can do this. The only reason I haven't smoked today is because I have been in the airport. 

I am really dreading doing this but I know I have to and should. But I don't want to. How have you guys convinced yourself that you want to quit?

**EDIT:** seriously, I don't actually want to do this at all. What do I do?!

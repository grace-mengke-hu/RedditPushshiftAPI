I feel like something is wrong.

Honestly, I never thought this could be this easy.  I'm 33 hours in now, and this is maybe one of 3 times that I've gone this long without a smoke in the last 7 years.  If I always wanted to quit so badly, my only question is why I am able to do this so easily now when the task seemed so daunting in the past.  Perhaps the worst is yet to come, but I'm ready for it!

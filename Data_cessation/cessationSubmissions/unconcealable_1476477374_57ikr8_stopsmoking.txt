1 year down, many more to go...

I made it. Thank you all for being supportive (even if you didn't know that you were). For those of you who are struggling through the early days of your quit, keep it up. You'll get to a place where time moves as fast as it did before you quit. The days turn into weeks, into months, and eventually into years.

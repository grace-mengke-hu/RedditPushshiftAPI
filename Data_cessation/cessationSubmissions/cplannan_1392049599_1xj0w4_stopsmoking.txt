Wanted to share my recent experiences...stay strong, guys and gals.

Hey everyone, this is my first time sharing on the sub.  I have been a lurker, and have regularly got support here when I was feeling ready to break.  As you can see from my badge, I'm only at 35 days, but that is by FAR the longest I've gone without in at least a decade.  

Anyway, my dad has been dealing with a chronic illness for many years.  His illness(es) led to having to take a lot of medication...and that medication, coupled with a drinking problem, led to my dad getting severe liver cirrhosis and passing away at 48 years old.

The "end game" started last Tuesday, when I was at about 28 days without.  My dad was a heavy smoker, as well, and we actually bonded a lot over the past few years over smokes.  My step-mom was not yet prepared to alter their house, so I was there for several days with my dad's beautiful roll-your-own cigarette collection out in the living room.  

But, I remembered one of the many edicts said on this sub - "smoking will not make a hard time any easier" and I am really proud to share that throughout all of this I DID NOT SMOKE!  The pride and challenge of staying smoke-free in the face of all this was one of the things that kept me going.  So, thanks to everyone here and please try to stay strong during your tough times.  Nothing is worth smoking again!

TL;DR - Dad, who loved smoking, passed away on Thursday.  Did not smoke through any of this rough time!

flair reset - new beginnings

108 days ago I set my badge for the first time on this subreddit. It was glorious. Everything was suddenly so much easier, even getting up in the mornings (which is something I normally consistently fail at). Life was great.

After little more than a month, I caved in. Most people I hang out with smoke, and I could not resist the urge. Before I knew it, I was hooked again and puffed away nearly a pack a day. This put a severe strain on my finances: I'm currently studying full time for an exam in September and have to rely on hand outs from my family to survive. The shame of putting most of my resources into smoking unsurprisingly made me smoke even more. I progressively stopped all the great habits I had tried to develop when stopping, such as exercising, or being proactively nice to people to avoid taking out my withdrawal pangs on them. 

However, I have continued browsing this subreddit, feeling guilty for my failure. 

Seeing all your success stories has progressively convinced me that I need to try again!  I just resetted the badge to wipe the slate clean. 

A big thank you to all of you who share your stories, you are great motivators for all of us out there! And I'll be sure to use your tips. Thank you in particular to  [u/Barking\_at\_the\_Moon](https://www.reddit.com/user/Barking_at_the_Moon) : you don't know me but your recent post was the one that tipped the balance.

See you on the other side!

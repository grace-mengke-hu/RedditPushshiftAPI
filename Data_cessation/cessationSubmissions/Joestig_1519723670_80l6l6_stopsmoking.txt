Ill from relapsing to smoking

This should stop, because what I am doing is crazy. I do not even enjoy smoking that much, but somehow there's this part of me who thinks it's a good idea to smoke. Just one cigarette. The thing is, it never is one cigarette. Whenever I relapse I smoke at least a few packages. Sometimes in a week, sometimes I smoke for months. But then I come back to my senses and I quit.

That moment has come again. My airways are not in a good condition due to a combination of smoking and the flu. I smoked my last cigarette like 5 days ago, and it's already getting better. From experience I know that the smoker's flu can last for many weeks.

Anyways, I think it's all fine. I know it's going to heal (and I am happy that it's not yet too late) and I hope that I remember how much needless suffering these death sticks caused. I wanted to become extremely fit this year, I think I already am because I can run 18+ kilometer per hour for 5 kilometers, and I am expecting to be able to do 20 km/h later this year. Smoking is surest way to sabotage my goals.

And it has dozens and dozens of other downsides. No one in their rational mind would smoke.

So, time to quit! Good luck on your journey as well!

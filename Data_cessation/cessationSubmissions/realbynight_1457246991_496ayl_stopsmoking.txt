Starting over.

I just had my last cigarette. This is the 3rd time I'm trying to quit, I went cold turkey for 2 months and fell right back in, I tired vaping and fell right back in. I can't go on smoking, my sinuses are fuck, my teeth are fucked and now my legs/feet are feeling the effects of decreased blood flow. I'm going to take it slow but I'm hopeful. I want to live.

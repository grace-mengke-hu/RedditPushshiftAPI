Black and Milds

I've found mixed answers online if you're supposed to inhale these or not...I've been smoking them for a week and I've been inhaling about 1/2 of them when I smoke the whole thing (other half just puffed).  I'm quitting smoking them but wanted to know how much damage I've probably done to my lungs over the course of the week.  Will there be any long time damage or is the week such a short time that it won't matter?  I've smoked a total of 10-15 of them over the course of the week.

Thanks.

How long does it take for your lung function to return to normal?

Hi all, about to join some of you on this journey. My lung feel as if they are functioning at 45% right now; and I've only been smoking for 2 years. How long will it take for that to recover? I want to do a tough mudder next year and smoking I feel is holding me back.

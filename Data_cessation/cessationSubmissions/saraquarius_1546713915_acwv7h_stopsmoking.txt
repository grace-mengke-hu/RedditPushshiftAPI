Day 5, quit cold turkey, gaining weight!

If it weren’t for this community, I don’t believe I would’ve started my quit plan. Thank you, all! Day 5 going OK. I’ve learned how to ignore/ overcome the cravings. I’ve been waking up 3-4 times each night so I’m getting less sleep, but I don’t feel overly tired throughout the day. On day 3 I was overcome with a sudden sadness, experienced a panic attack, and started bawling crying — which went on for a few hours. I was literally cooking dinner over the stove with tears rolling down my face lol.

I maintain a pretty healthy and clean diet, and I am eating basically the same amount of calories as before (between 1300-1500 calories/day), but I’ve gained about 6 lbs in less than a week. I realize that, when you quit smoking, your metabolism slows down tremendously. How long until it goes back to normal? Will it ever? I know that I am healthier person now more than I ever was, but a dramatic weight gain is overshadowing any optimistic feelings. Should I up my exercise routine? Thanks everyone! You guys are great!!

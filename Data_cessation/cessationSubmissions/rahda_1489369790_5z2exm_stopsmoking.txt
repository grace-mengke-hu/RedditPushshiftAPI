Detox symptoms and easing

One thing I feel that gets left out of a lot of online resources is the detoxification one will feel and experience when going through smoking cessation. Some people don't have strong symptoms and others a lot! What types have you had and how do you help them. 
I have for the first two weeks after quitting had extreme fatigue which is just starting to lift in the past few days. I also have had a headache the entire time which has been just starting to clear the past few days. Also felt like I have had a low grade flu. 
It is improving but I think it helps to be prepared for these! 

What helps me?
Drinking a lot of water
Making fresh veggie juices, eating plenty of fruits and veggies, dark leafy ones, nuts, dried fruits
Lots of herbal tea support
Supplements
Taking time to rest
Short walks, exercise if not too tired

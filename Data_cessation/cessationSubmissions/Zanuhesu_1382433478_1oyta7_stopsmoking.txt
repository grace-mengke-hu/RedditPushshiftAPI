I'm done

Today I quit smoking. It has taken me 7 years of at least one pack a day to realise, and admit to myself that I am addicted to it and that the cigarettes more or less rule my life. The cough and difficulty of breathing, especially in the mornings is terrible and I want to be rid of it. I've had several tries before where I failed after a certain amount of time, the longest I've ever lasted was about a year, but then I started again due to the false belief it would relieve some stress at a major turning point in my life.

I'm positive that this time around I can do it. I've got the support of everyone in my life that matters, and this time it'll work out. Onwards to a smoke free life!

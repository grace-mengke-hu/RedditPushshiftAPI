Trying to quit but I can't shake this feeling it hat something doesn't feel right.

Preface:  ignore the badge, it's been a while since I've rejoined the community.

I am trying to quit but I can't shake the feeling like something feels different - strange.  It's like I feel out of place or I'm missing out on being "me".  I don't know how to describe it - does anyone else know what I'm talking about or how to get through it?

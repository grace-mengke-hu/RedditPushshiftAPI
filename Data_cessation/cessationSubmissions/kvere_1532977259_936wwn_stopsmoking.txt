Day 8- The first 3 days were a breeze, now I’m craving hard

I’ve tried to quit before but I really, really really want it to stick this time.

I found it was super easy to ignore cravings while working. But I’m on my second day off now, and I’m going insane. 

I don’t want to be this miserable all the time. These cravings are downright *painful* 

Not 100 per cent sure why I’m posting this... I just need someone to hold me accountable.

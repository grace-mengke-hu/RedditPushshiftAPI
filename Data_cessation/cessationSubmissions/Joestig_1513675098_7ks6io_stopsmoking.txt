1 month! These are my experiences...

Can't believe I made it, but I am so happy that I did this.

Now I can't imagine I used to smoke. That feeling started more than 2 weeks ago and it sticked. As far as I remember, I have had zero temptation in this period. That was really surprising to me, because I expected that it would be a struggle.

However, I am not naive, part of my brain is still wired to smoke and I should make sure that I don't stimulate that. For that reason (and others) I also quit drinking alcohol (one week later). Alcohol reduces your willpower, and so I have had many relapses due to this stuff.

Some positive effects (or things that happened to me this month): I have lost 3 kg, my diet is much healthier, my taste is better, it's easier to breathe, I exercise more, I am much better at exercising (especially cardio), I have improved many other areas of my life now that my mindset is much better; I embrace challenges and I want to make my days alive count.

Not smoking makes my days better in many ways, and not only that, I get to live longer. I don't know how long, but I will not live this life to the max!

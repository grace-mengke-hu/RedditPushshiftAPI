Having an exceptionally hard week

Tons of life changes going on, money, work, house, car, feeling sick. Been craving junk food instead, and stopped working out this past week. Not sure where my energy is but I'm so bleh that I thought about smoking. Surprised because I rarely feel this way now. Any word of wisdom?

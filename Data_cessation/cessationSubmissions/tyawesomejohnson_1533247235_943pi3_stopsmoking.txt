Will a Cigar Reset Withdrawal

So I smoked for one year at a pretty heavy amount until on June 24th I decided I was going to quit. August 15th is my birthday and i was planning on having a cigar and yes I’m aware of the risks and am choosing to take them. 

I’m not worried about relapse because of the hell I went through during withdrawal and I just could never do that to myself again however, I’m afraid that one cigar will reset my withdrawal since by then I will have only been clean roughly 2 months.

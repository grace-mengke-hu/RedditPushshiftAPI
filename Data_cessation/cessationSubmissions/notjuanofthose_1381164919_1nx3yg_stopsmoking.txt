Today I turn 10,000 days old - Day 1 tobacco free

I had decided the quit date since last week, only yesterday I learnt that it's my [10,000 days "birthday"](http://imgur.com/F5Tqu9t) and I find it very *poetic/convenient/just cool.*

I haven't had a cigarette since last night. By this time on a normal day I would've already had 3 or 4. Some cravings are strong but they go away quicker than I thought and I really don't want to smoke, so it's been easy so far. I know I'm gonna go through some rough times this week so I'll be stopping by this sub often.

Good luck to everyone and any advice or experiences you want to share are welcome.

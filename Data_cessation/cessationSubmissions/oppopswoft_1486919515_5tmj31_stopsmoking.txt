Forming a habit. Looking for advice

Picked up smoking socially from an ex. Was fun while we were out drinking. When I broke up with her, I bought a pack because it reminded me of her. Started having a cigarette here and there to deal with stress at work. Half a year later and I'm smoking one to two sticks a day.

Long story short, I deal with a lot of anger and anxiety. Cigarettes are honestly one of the best forms of catharsis I've ever found in my 27 years. If I feel a mood coming on or I'm grumpy or stressed or freaking out, they help me relax and sort through my emotional state. They are an outlet for aggression. They are a conduit for meditation. But they're poison.

I'd like to nip this habit in the bud, but the benefits it has had in my life are difficult to ignore. And I don't know how to replace it. Advice?

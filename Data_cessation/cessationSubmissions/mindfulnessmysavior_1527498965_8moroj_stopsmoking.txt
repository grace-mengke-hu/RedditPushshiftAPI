As a 25 Year old man , I am ashamed of myself. But I am not giving up anymore.

Last night I ended up in a very bad argument with my parents for a family issue . Driven by anxiety and irritation, I used very offensive abusive language, I even hit my mother slightly on her back as she was going to make me calm down by grabbing me in her arms. My father called his friend who is also our neighbor, he stopped us. . After getting back to my room, I cried a lot and fell asleep on my bed. Woke up in the morning and now I'm trying to reorganize everything I messed up. My mom is really surprised with my behavior. She thinks something is going on in my life and I'm hiding it from them. But I know it's because of cigarettes, it's because of addiction that I'm trying to quit. I know like every difficult time it will  pass. And then I will be free. I'm glad I didn't think of cigarettes last night. I'm glad that I was able to cry and fall asleep. Cigarettes are not solution. It's the cause of all the misery. Sometimes I really lose  my mind. As a 25 year old man I'm ashamed of myself.

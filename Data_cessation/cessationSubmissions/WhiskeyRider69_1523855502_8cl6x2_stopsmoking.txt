Yay! Insomnia!

My sleep had been weird since I quit, but I've been able to fall asleep every night. Tonight it's finally caught me. Been laying in bed for 3 hours now and can't seem to fall asleep. Tomorrow is going to suck. Ugh. When does my sleep return to normal? Had a lot of insomnia in my 20's and worked hard to get rid of it. Not really interested in suffering through it again.

4 days...

I posted a few days ago, and just wanted to update. 

I am indeed pregnant, smoked the last cigarette when I found out and haven't even thought about it since. ... ok well that is not entirely true, but being pregnant does wonders for the will power. Four days has flown by. I was not terribly excited about being pregnant, but day by day I catch myself smiling about it. It will be ok, and I am actually pretty happy now. Still trying not to get too excited until I get the tests done next week.


Hopefully I am over the crazy mood swings. That was awful. 
My husband stepped up and is being 100% supportive and awesome. 


Just an FYI for ladies who have not been pregnant. You start counting your pregnancy from the beginning of your last cycle. So even though its only been one week since my skipped period I am 5 weeks pregnant. Meaning I smoked for the first month of my pregnancy (because I didn't know) and I feel horrible about it.

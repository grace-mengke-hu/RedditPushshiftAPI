Checking in, three cheers, and an idea

Hi team! 
Well, I've passed the three-month mark. It feels fantastic. I was smoking nearly a pack per day since I was 20 years old. Now at 29 I feel healthier and happier than any of those years in between.

This past week I went camping on my first-ever solo trip where I woke at 5:00 every morning and went to bed around 9:00 every night. I was moving, hiking many miles, fishing and maintaining my campsite all day through rain and storms and hot sun. And, yet, I felt full of energy every day. Upon reflection on my final day, I realized I would've closed up shop about halfway through that trip as a smoker: Too tired, probably in need of more smokes.

So, three cheers for 3 months in the bag and no desire to look back!

Anyhow, here's my idea:
My quit-smoking apps say I've spared myself 13.607 grams of tar from the 1,700 cigarettes I would've smoked by now. I know when trying to lose weight it helped to see what the weight I lost was equivalent to (e.g., I've lost as much as a car tire!) and have something to strive for. Likewise, it would be cool to have a visual equivalent of the tar savings: What does 13.6 grams of tar look like? What about 30 grams? Might be worth developing something sometime. Or, maybe there's something like that already out there that I am just not aware of.

Lastly: HEY EVERYONE DON'T GIVE UP!

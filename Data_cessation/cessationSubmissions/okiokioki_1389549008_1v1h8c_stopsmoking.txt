Another attempt to quit

Been smoking for 10+ years now. Made multiple attempts but they never last more than a week or two. 

For the last few months I have stopped smoking on weekends. But something about the office environment and the habit makes me go for a smoke unconsciously. Even a small amount of stress and boredom makes me want to light a cigarette.

Another problem I have is that I'm actually well aware of the negatives of smoking, how it affects health, how habits and routines work and how to break them. I've read Allen Carr's book cover to cover. Read power of habit as well. Thinking fast and slow too. But that still doesn't override the instinct or the habit I've developed over the years.

Wish me luck and advice if you have any.

EDIT: I have no idea why my flair says 773 days.

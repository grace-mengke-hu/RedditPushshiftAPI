"Once a smoker, always a smoker" vs. "non-smoker"

I've been wondering if a smoker can ever become a "non-smoker"... I mean, I've heard other addicts say things like "I'm a recovering alcoholic". I am in the middle of day 6 and it certainly feels like I will always be a "smoker in recovery", but I don't know if that's just my brain trying to make me relapse. I cannot believe I won't pick up a cigarette in the following 50 years, I just can't picture it. I really don't have any intention to pick up a cigarette just now, but still... "never" is just such a long time...

What do you think? can we become "non-smokers"? if so, how long after you quit did you consider yourself one of them?

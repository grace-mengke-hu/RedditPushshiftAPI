Friend missed work for a week. Finally met him today.

Great guy. Army veteran. Very good work ethic, humble, gets things done right without any trouble. Straight shooter, honest. Just moved to a new city. New job, new girlfriend. Adjusting to Los Angeles. Has been hard. Job sucks. News back home haven't been great -- father passing year before, younger brother OD'd few months ago.

Regular smoker. Only saw on during the breaks. Told me he was out because he was hospitalized at the VA for trouble breathing. Had pain right below his right chest, like he pulled a muscle. Imaging showed some growth in his lung. Explained his shortness of breath. Told me he might have a bit of his lung removed. I am incredulous. Ask him how long he's been smoking.

Since 14, a pack a day. He's 32. I stupidly remove my filter. "Fuck are you for real man?" I run through my head, not knowing what to say. He was on depressive medicine and was prescribed stimulants which masked whatever fatigue which should have been there. He mentioned he was gonna stop medicaiton. "You gotta take whatever drugs they give you. There's a new medicine out, MABs. If you don't you're practically dead." Then he mentioned he meant the anti-depressives. He's wheezing by the end of the conversation.

He's bummed. I am bummed. I feel stupid for breaking any news which his doctor did not share with him. I just heard a few hours ago, it's still in my head. Family members said just forget about it, it's something you shouldn't worry about, because it's too late. I don't even know how to react. Maybe it's benign. Maybe I'm stupid. I don't know the prognosis. I'm not a doctor.

This is a good man. There's not enough good men in the world. He doesn't have any children. He's in the "prime" of his life. It shouldn't be like this. If only if he had ... fuck. I shouldn't think ahead.

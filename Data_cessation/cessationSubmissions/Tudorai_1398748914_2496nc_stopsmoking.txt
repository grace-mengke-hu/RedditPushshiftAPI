Small relapses, but generally on track....

Last post was 4 days ago.  Prior to that point I was trolling this subreddit.  I put my last smoke out before I made my previous post.

So I had a couple of small relapses but within a draw or two I quickly threw the smoke (and the pack which I bought) on the floor (and in the trash respectively).  

I feel myself becoming immensely frustrated and irritable.  This gets to the point where working out or taking a walk does not seem enough to calm me.  These are the points where I have capitulated and smoked.  I worry that I am conditioning myself to be frustrated so that I may smoke. (Am I becoming Pavlovs Dog?)

Generally I have been mostly reclusive playing ESO as I don't want to have any negative interactions with people I know in real life.

From 1-2 packs a day to the equivalent of maybe 1 full smoke in the last 4 is a huge win for me, I plan to keep going.  Also, I find the act of posting to act as a release of frustration ... I don't know why, just thought I'd share.

Non-smoker vs smoker who chooses not to smoke

I read somewhere that if you call yourself a non-smoker you may be tempted into a couple of puffs or a whole cigarette someday because you've convinced yourself it doesn't matter. That it might be wiser to acknowledge that you are a smoker who chooses not to smoke. What do you guys think?

I failed, but didn't give up.

I went 48 hours before my mind got the best of me, I had that one which caused a small , ended up having 7 within the past 3 days. I usually have 20ish or a pack a day so even though I broke,  I cut out almost 19 a day. Have the patch on for that initial first day boost but I'm gonna keep trying. Good luck to all and thanks.

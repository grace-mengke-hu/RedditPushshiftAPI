Getting back on the horse...

So, ten year smoker...and I'm done. I've tried the gum, I've tried the patch, I've tried cold turkey(that poor bastard of a door didn't know what the hell kicked it...) and last week I bought a JoyE eGo 510 kit, got it on Monday night, been nipping at it all day today and...this is great!

My throat doesn't feel like it's filled with shrapnel like smoking cigarettes did and I'm really enarmored at the idea that I can control my nicotine intake with the juice. Hell, I didn't have any major cravings today either with this thing.

I'm at 18mg right now, and I plan to spend a few months here and start working my way down to lower dosages and quit entirely. Here's to getting healthy!

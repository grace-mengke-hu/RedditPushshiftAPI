What’s wrong with me?

I failed my day one... again. 
I’m so sick of smoking, yet I always freak out and buy a pack... and I sit here again thinking how much I hate it, sitting outside by myself, yet I kinda enjoy going and sitting by myself. 
It’s like I’m scared of my life without smoking .. I get so panicked and just smoke again :( 
I’m T1D for 24 yrs. I have a daughter. Why can’t my brain just stop wanting them or panicking.. my self discipline or willpower feels like I just have none :-( is this normal?

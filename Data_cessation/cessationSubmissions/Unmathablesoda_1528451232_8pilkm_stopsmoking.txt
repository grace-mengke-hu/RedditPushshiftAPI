Today i start lurking here, some motivation/ encouragement or warnings more than welcome..

So i quit drinking almost a year ago with r/stopdrinking. Last week someone told me "dude smoking just doesn't suit you anymore" and heck he was right. The advantages i got from not drinking are just, incredible, its unbelievable and i'm wondering if you get some of the same advantages/ feelings when you give up smoking? When i gave up the drink i made a list and a timetable of what to expect with the help from people over there and i'd like to do the same with smoking.

So would you be so kind to list some advantages/ hard times that you've encountered during this thing?

k cool, thanks new friends ;)

Unmathable..

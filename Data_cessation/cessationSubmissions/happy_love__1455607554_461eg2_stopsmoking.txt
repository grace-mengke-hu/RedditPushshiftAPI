Help?

Well today marks one week since my last smoke, before this I went another week but I had a few smokes on Monday,  now its another week, everything kinda hit the fan as I got the quitters flu and this girl I had an amazing time with yesterday is ignoring me and I have no coping methods of how to deal with stress as ive been smoking since I was like 15 I really want a smoke but if I have one everything will be wasted and ill neeed to start all over again ahhhh this is soo fuckikg stressful i dont have any more weed so I really don't know what to do there are smokes all over my house and stuff  all I can think about is lighting up that smoke and enjoying the stress relief  it brings me along with the self mutilation it causes. Like I need to almost hurt myself to get rid of this stress I feel like im going crazy ahhh

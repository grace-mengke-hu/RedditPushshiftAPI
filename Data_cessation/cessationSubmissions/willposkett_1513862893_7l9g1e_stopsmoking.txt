What was your tipping point?

I have been smoking for 15 years, started at 19. I feel like i am in a total rut. Ive quit tons of times, but keep falling off the wagon. I know its bad for me, my lungs hurt, my skin and teeth look rubbish.  

It annoys me that this is one of the few things in my life i cant nail. I did well at uni, have a good career and my health (so far). So why cant i tie down/fix this thing? Friends of mine who aren't that successful in other aspects of their life have managed to quit, so why can i?

Sorry i probably sound like whiny child, but i don't know what to do. I'm curious to hear from succesful quitters, what was your moment of 'enough is enough' and what was the switch that gave you the belief you could do it.

I really don't want to do this anymore!

Need to vent

So I'm the average lurker. I don't really post or comment that much, but reading your posts have always been inspiring.

I decided recently to quit, again, and I'm now on day 10 and it's starting to get to me. These little lies keep popping up in my head and I notice that I'm trying to convince myself that smoking isn't all terrible. Why not just one or two to ease the process? I've had cravings before and I usually fail at around the 2 week mark (For some reason that's where it gets really bad for me) so I'm noticing that it's getting worse.

So this time I'm doing something I didn't do before. I'm reaching out to you guys who are in the same boat. I'm not the guy who asks for help, because of my dumb pride, but I need to understand that I probably can't pull this off alone.

At this point, all I need is a small "pick me up" so I can get through this evening. A big pot of coffee is brewing as I'm typing this and I'm simply trying to keep myself occupied in any way I can think off.

This forum is perfect for these kinds of days, where the cravings are just... "The one ring to rule them all" level of deceptive and evil. Keep it up people, I'll be here rooting for you.

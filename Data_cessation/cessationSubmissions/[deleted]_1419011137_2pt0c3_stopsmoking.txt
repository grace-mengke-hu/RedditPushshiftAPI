10+ attempts, this one will stick.....

I quit on Monday, 12/15. Cold turkey. I have tried 10+ times but this time, it will stick. My lungs are crap. I'm tired of people telling me that I'm wheezing. I hate it when I wake up in the middle of the night in a coughing fit because I can't breath. 

My wife still smokes and I've asked her not to smoke in the car while I'm in there. She said she will respect that. I hope she eventually quits too because I know all too well, a smoker only quits when they WANT to quit.

Day 1 in my new life without cigarettes!

I started smoking nearly two decades ago. Like most it started small. One smoke one night, turned into bumming them from friends while at the bar. That turned into buying my own pack and of course, that led to smoking all the time. For a while there I was pretty much a pack a day smoker. Then, maybe ten years ago or so I quit. Well- mostly. I'd still have the odd one here and there and from time to time (especially if I had a few drinks) and I told myself that because I wasn't smoking every day or all the time that I had beaten it. But, like glowing embers after a fire all that was needed to get me going again was a little fuel.

That fuel was that my SO suddenly started to smoke a few years ago. And now, with her smoking I didn't have to feel guilty about smoking right? The habit started back up again, escalated to about a half pack a day and that's where I've been since.

It wasn't like before though, as now I had become a closet smoker. While I smoked with her, I hid it from everyone else. But you can only hide it so long and little by little those close to me found out. My family now knew that I was smoking again, but with the exception of one friend at work no-one else did. It's a tough business trying to keep it hidden. Sneaking a cigarette during break, puffing it as quickly as possible and being paranoid the whole time that someone might see me. I longed to just kick the habit so I didn't have to hide anymore.

So that's where I'm at. I finished reading the "EasyWay to quit smoking" last night and decided to make today the day. I am genuinely excited to start a new life without cigarettes and I'm committed to it. I'm DOING this and never looking back!

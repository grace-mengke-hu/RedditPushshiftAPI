I’ve stopped smoking cold turkey after a massive dose of magic mushrooms.

Smoker since 25 years. Or should I say since I was born because my mother used to smoke while she was pregnant? Anyway, never missed one day. In the last 3-4 years I’d wake up in the morning and have three coffees and three cigarettes before going out. And that was the start...

So, it wasn’t even my trip intention to stop smoking but somehow during that trip I’ve realised that what I really need to survive it’s just breathing (and some food and water). After the trip slowed down I went out for a cigarette as I normally do and just before lightning it up, I thought: Do I really need it? No. Does it makes me feeling any better? No. Does it give me something good? Nope. 

From that moment on I’ve stopped smoking. I’ve never felt the urge to do it since then, it’s around two weeks now, I don’t even count the days. Now, it’s not that I wouldn’t like to smoke a cigarette, maybe after a beer or a coffee, it’s just that I can’t see why I should do it. My brain rewired itself somehow. 

That cigarette is still lying around my desk so I can remind the motherfucker, on a daily basis, who’s the boss in charge here.

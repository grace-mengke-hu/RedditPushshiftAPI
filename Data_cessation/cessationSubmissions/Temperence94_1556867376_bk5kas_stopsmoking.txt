Some thoughts/advice on quitting

This is my 2nd solid attempt at quitting now and I’m approaching the record of the first time I quit (4 months) I’ve switched to vaping and I’m already down to 3mg with plans to phase that out within the next year or two which brings me to a small piece of advice that worked for me

Set yourself a deadline to quit but absolutely do not worry if you go over that deadline because the time has to be right for you, I wait until I graduated and even 6 months after that until I felt totally comfortable and it seems to be working. So stay strong and don’t worry too much about setting deadlines and dates, do it at your own pace!

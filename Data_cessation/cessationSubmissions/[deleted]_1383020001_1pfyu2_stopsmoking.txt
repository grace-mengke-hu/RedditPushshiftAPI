Okay so .. I'm here to quit I guess.

Well, thankfully my habit has only been active 4-ish years. So I think that I have a good chance to improve my overall health. The obvious hard part is everytime I quit, something stupid always brings me back. Whether it be at the gas station to pick up a quick drink, or with a bunch of friends ... 


I think the most difficult part is it's making me more lazy and unproductive. I just feel less motivated to actually do something. I'ts tough. 


Has vaping truly helped some people? Does it feel different, or is it similar? I'm thinking of ditching the pack and going tomorrow to get a starter kit. What other things have helped you to stay smoke-free.


Thanks :)

Ermahgerd

Sitting on 20 hours off right now, feels good! I feel so energetic. At the same time I’m craving and I know all I gotta do is resist... for one day, and then the next day, and so on and so forth. What an odd addiction. I’ve come off of real drugs before and the withdraws are obvious, with this it’s like I don’t feel withdraws but I still feel like somethings missing (for now). I’d say there’s an 86% chance I make it through today, however optimistic or non-optimistic that may sound.

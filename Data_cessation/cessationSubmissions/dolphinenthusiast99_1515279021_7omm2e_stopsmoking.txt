10 years of smoking and my vulnerable truth

It's been 2 days 18 hours since my last cigarette 

I used to believe I needed the cigarette to feel secure, to feel strong, to feel that I could get through the hard times. Wow was I wrong. I was a slave forced to believe I was not strong enough to get through life's obstacles. 

I am embarrassed for allowing myself to smoke for 10 years and prevent me from growing into the person I've always envisioned.

Preventing me from being more physically active

Preventing me from the confidence of a secure man who has control over his emotions his thoughts his actions.

Looking back... who the f am I ? 

To anyone looking to quit - it is a lot easier when you realize it prevents you from loving to your true potential 

That person you know you can be 

The person who you are

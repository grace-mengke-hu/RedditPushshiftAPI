Hey everyone!

My 2 weeks is tomorrow! I'm very excited. I've had a rather easy time quitting, even tho I smoked for 4 years. I haven't really even thought about it. And all my friends have been very supportive and respectful. They all know to go outside to smoke when I'm around. It's great to know they care. Keep up the good work everyone, you can do it!

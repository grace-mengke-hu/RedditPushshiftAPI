Two weeks and cravings are at their worst.

This is probably the longest I've gone without nicotine in over ten years. I've found it pretty easy till now, but today part of me is saying, "Fuck it, I should just light a cig; I can always quit again..."

I know it's the "nicotine monster" trying to trap me again and I refuse to give in, but it's getting tough. Also, I struggle to get out of bed in the mornings since quitting, as the thought of my first smoke used to motivate me.

At the same time I'm enjoying some of the benefits, like a good sense of smell, and being able to walk the hill to my house without getting out of breath, etc. 

What are some good techniques to get through the unhelpful thoughts and cravings?

The Easyway book really IS helpful.

At first I was so skeptical about Allen Carr's book, and it annoyed me how much people talked about it on this subreddit. I have just finished the book, along with stopping smoking, and already I feel amazing. This book really does make stopping infinitely times easier.

Normally I would have put out my "last" cigarette and instantly feel panic-stricken and I would be moping. Soon enough I'd light a cigarette, claiming THAT would be my last one. Rinse and repeat.

Now I KNOW that I will never smoke again, I'm genuinely extremely happy about it, I haven't been as happy in a while.

If you want to stop and you're also skeptical about the book, please, give it a shot.

Just for the amusement factor, I was told by a friend (who is a smoker) that he thought this book had brainwashed me. How ironic.

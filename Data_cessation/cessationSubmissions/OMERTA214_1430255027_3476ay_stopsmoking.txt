Not a huge milestone, but...

I just reached 72 hours! Aka 3 days! I honestly went into this quit with a completely different mindset, and that's what has been working for me. Before when I attempted to quit...I didn't want to truly quit, I just knew that I should. I wasn't ready to be serious about it. However 3 days ago I simply told myself "I'm done. No matter how bad the cravings are at first, I'm not losing the fight to my brain playing tricks on me. Every craving will pass, and it time it will get easier. I am not a smoker." 

The day 2 cravings were mild, and most of today has been hit or miss. I've had some strong urges, but I've already come this far and now I wont give it up for anything. I'm barely coughing in the morning anymore, my smell is slowly coming back, and I'm hitting the gym hard every day to keep my mind off it. Thanks to everyone here for creating this non smoking sanctuary...and everyone keep strong! 

See you guys at the official 1 week mark!

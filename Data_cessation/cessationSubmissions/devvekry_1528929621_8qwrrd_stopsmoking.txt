Reading Allan Carr... and still terrified.

Just subscribed to this thread today. Hi. 

I have smoked for 20 years. I have vaped for 4 years. Yep! I do both. Brilliant, right? 

I "tried" to quit with patches once, maybe 10 years ago, but it was admittedly half assed.

I am half way through Allan Carr's The Easy Way to Quit Smoking. I watched the youtube video today. I am feeling like a non-smoker exactly ZERO%. Is this bullshit? Or am I expecting too much?

How did you do it?!

Trying to be healthy but cigs are holding me back

I've been a cigarette smoker for nearly 8 years. On average I smoke 8-10 a day. I was an athlete growing up but slowly cigarettes, weed, and other drugs started to consume my life. I'm happy to say that weed, booze, and other drugs are no longer a problem in my life but cigarettes still are. The last month or so I have been running about 2 miles 3x a week plus 50 pushups after each run. I manage to make it those 2 miles non stop but it is still way harder than it should be. I am trying to choose healthy habits and whatnot but I just can't get myself to make a REAL attempt to quit smoking cigs. It's really frustrating and depressing. I've read a lot on here about Allen Carr's book. I think when I get my next paycheck I am going to buy it. Anyways, I guess this is just me venting. I really want to quit. Desperately. I just need to do it and stop thinking about doing it! It's truly a terrifying thought to me.

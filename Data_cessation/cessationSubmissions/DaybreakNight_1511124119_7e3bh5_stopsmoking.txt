20 days :) feeling accomplished

Made it to 20 days smoke free! :) feels good man, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't get cravings, even after only smoking for one year. Sometimes it's a melancholy, rainy day and I crave those quiet and reflective moments by my lonesome, or I hear one of my old jams that I would listen to during my smoking days and it takes me back.

Trying not to get complacent, and just taking it one day at a time. Be strong guys and gals, we can do this! :)

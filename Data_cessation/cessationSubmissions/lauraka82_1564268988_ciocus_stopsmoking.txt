Brain almost got me

Had a pretty sudden craving today after 105 days—it didn’t last long but had to remind myself that I don’t smoke. My boyfriend still smokes—we both smoked American spirits and those burn for a long time compared to other brands so we would o my smoke half at a time and leave the other half for later. Don’t ask me why, but I loovveeed the later half. I would intentionally wait for boyfriend to go out and light up a new one so I could go out after him for the second half. Sounds strange I know...

Anyways...I’m walking out back with my son to go in the pool and there’s half a cigarette sitting in the ashtray...it’s like I instinctually thought that I need to grab it and light it. Had I not been paying attention I probably would have just put if pure instinct/habit/whatever...

It wasn’t a big deal, but wanted to share because it came out of nowhere and I had to intentionally remind myself that I don’t do that...hasn’t happened to me in a long while

When one person dies, it's a tragedy, but when a million people die it's a statistic.

We as smokers know that thousands or millions of people around the world die from smoking related illnesses every year but we tend to ignore it until it happens to someone close to us. A gal named Mel was in my department at work. She was in her mid-fifties, rode a motorcycle and loved playing pranks and practical jokes on people. She was an avid bowler and loved cats and traveling. She smoked a ton. Probably a pack a day, if not more. In 2014 she went to the doctor for what she thought was a chest infection and turned out to be lung cancer. She passed away yesterday morning from pneumonia. Crazy. She was 4 years away from retirement. Fuck that. I'm never smoking again. I want to retire and enjoy life for awhile. If you keep smoking, you will become a tragedy AND a statistic. 

Sorry to sound like such a Debbie Downer. If anyone is on the fence about quitting smoking, you should write a self post here in this subreddit. Tell us a little about yourself, get yourself a badge, and save your life! Private Message me. I will do almost anything to help you stop smoking!

Hello again, r/stopsmoking. I'm back, and miss the support of this forum. :)

Thanks to some medical debt and a recent periodontal procedure (gum tissue graft), I had no choice but to quit smoking (at the insistence of the periodontist who did the procedure). Logically, I know it's the right call and I just need to let it stick this time. I have never been in this much debt, and the money I would save quitting would pay off this debt in less than a year. All of these things should be great indicators that quitting is the right decision, besides all of the other obvious reasons (health and NOT dying of cancer).


WHY on EARTH am I still in the mindset that this quit is temporary? That, once my gum heals, I can just smoke again, and be able to quit another time? Why do we keep putting it off? 


I can tell I feel healthier and less anxious. My skin is clearing up and I don't wheeze. Food taste better and smells SMELL better. My car is so nice and clean that I always offer to drive and enjoy being in it.


Every morning is a grump fest until I put my patch on (patches work wonders for me, I will gradually decrease/wean off of these. Cold turkey just has not been an effective method for me). I feel bad for my partner. . . My routine of wake up, feed cat, smoke, go back to bed is so hardwired into my brain that I snooze my alarm and make myself late for work because I don't want to deal with the annoyance of not having a morning smoke (though I DO still get up to feed my cat). I wish I could wear patches to sleep! The dreams are too weird. :-D


Any helpful words on how to shift my focus in the right direction?


Sorry if this is all over the place. I don't even know where to begin. Tired of being broke and smelly all the time, and hate the fact that I love cigarettes. 


Keep up the good work everyone. &lt;3

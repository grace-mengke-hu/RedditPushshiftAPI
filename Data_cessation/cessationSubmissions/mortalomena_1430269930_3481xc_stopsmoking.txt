How can I quit when deep down I dont want to?

I know its harmful, my smoking dad just had a diagnose of dramatically lowered lung efficiency, cant remember right now what disease it is.

Its just that I love smoking. I love the warm feel from the first puff of the day. I love that it tastes even better after a cup of coffee. EVEN better after couple beers.

Im down to about 0 to 20 cigs per day. Mostly 0 because I have e-cig, but I much rather would smoke a real one. Then when im out drinking I smoke real ones.

I heard theres a medicine that makes you hate cigs. Is there, and does it work? Any help apreciated! I dont want to end up in an early grave, atleast not because of cigarettes.

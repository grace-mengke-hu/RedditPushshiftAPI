Checking in - 5 months and then some.

I'm finding that I no longer really post, but rather lurk here on a day to day basis. I honestly read the most recent posts each time and it makes me happy to see so many new people taking that big leap. I am also happy to see so many people still fighting the good fight. For me, it's been 5 months since I last smoked a cigarette. Do I still get cravings? Sure. Do they interrupt my day? Not in the least bit. I guess I just wanted to tell all my fellow quitters (new and old) that we totally got this.

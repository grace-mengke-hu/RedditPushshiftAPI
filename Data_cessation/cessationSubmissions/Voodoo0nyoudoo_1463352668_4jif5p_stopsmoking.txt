Day 2

I hate smoking so much but I love it even more.  I have tried a few times all half heartedly. You name it patch gum chantix. Patch worked the best, but always end up sucking down the cigs even harder then before because I don't want them to go.  I am on 12 years now which is killing me I notice the health defects, my job requires me to be fit. I can hack it and get things done, but could be better. The guilt kills me, the duration kills me and what hurts the most is I still want to keep going. I am on day two and managed to not buy some at the store an hour ago. I even went to the aisle specifically to get a pack but didn't small victories i suppose. Just wanted to share and get some support because being 30 and 12 yrs of smoking is sad,but dying at 40 or 45 is just not good enough.

Three weeks with no cigarette!

Roughly three weeks ago I started on the e-cig, 12mg. I quit smoking cigarettes the same day. Now I am down to 6mg and trying to finish the bottle before I go down again (don't want to waste it). It's been a little over a year since the last time I really tried to quit, so this is very exciting for me! And I have also found a new love of custard flavoring.

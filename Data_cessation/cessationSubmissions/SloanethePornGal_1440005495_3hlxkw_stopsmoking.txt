Question about cravings

Hey guys and girls, so I'm 5 days cig free and I just want to know WILL IT EVER GET ANY EASIER? I feel like the lamest person in the world but my every waking thought is consumed by cigarettes. I am so moody, I have no appetite, I am so lonely and sad. I know that I should look at all these things as reasons to quit and stay away from nicotine but I'm so scared that these feelings will NEVER go away. 

Also, I take 25mg of Adderall and jfc does that ever make me want to smoke. Seriously, this is kind of awful. Will I spend the rest of my life thinking about cigs? It's day 5 and it's really not getting any easier. 

One more thing: did anyone else notice that they couldn't taste food after they quit? My tongue feels super numb and fuzzy and I have the sensation that I burnt my tongue and also have a head cold. Tongue feels rough and raw and I cannot taste anything except for sweet things, which is terrible because I also quit sugar a month ago. 

Ugh, anyways I'm having a rough time, can someone please tell me it will really get better and mean it? Thanks :)

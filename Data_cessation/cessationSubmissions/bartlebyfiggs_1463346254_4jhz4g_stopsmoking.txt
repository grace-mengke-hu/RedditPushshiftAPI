Query regarding prolonged muscle tension

Anybody else experienced prolonged muscle tension?  I quit on January 29th, have been getting back into shape and at first wrote off some developed elbow tendinitis as over-exercise, but rest makes no difference.  I guess it does feel like I'm always tensing up, just... it's been months, how much longer till my body chills the fuck out.  Don't have money for a doctor so I'm doing the best I can with self-diagnosis over the internet, RICE therapy seems to help, but it'd be nicer if I could just heal and move on already.  Anyone else have similar experiences?

Day 5: Fuck 'Em

There's an unnerving irony that I became a smoker, starting in college, after my parents had quit so long ago after the doctor said "Your son has terrible asthma. You need to stop."

I grew out of the asthma and hated cigarettes. Always. If you asked me what led me to tolerate the shitty taste, I couldn't tell you. I know I was stressed and fucking up hard (oh those growing years in college), but I cannot remember the brain process that led to Yeah, smoking Newport Menthol 100s at a pack a day is totally what I want to do!"

I quit various times, only to fail. I quickly shifted from the Newports. Ran the gauntlet of cigs and their various social images. I was smoking around 3-4 a day on average towards the end this time. But I was fucking tired of it. I love running, I like being fit, I love cologne, I like smells. I was tired of compromising all of that.

So now it's 5 days. And I don't know if I'm compartmentalizing cravings away to a dark crevice of my brain, but it's not that paralytic. I associate cigs with situations rather than a release and I think that helped a lot. 

Been running 3.5/4 miles a day. Helps me see the benefit more than anything else. Glad my clothes smell good. Cleaned my car the fuck out, steam clean and everything.

The other day was a beautiful sunny Sunday - I had gotten off of work, was having a drink at a bar and around smokers. That's the fuckin shit right there, that's the cig I live for. If not right there, then driving home with some good music. But I resisted and was really happy I did. Glad to be done with cigs. Fuck 'Em.

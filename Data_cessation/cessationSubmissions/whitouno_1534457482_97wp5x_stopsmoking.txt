Good things about quitting

Most part of the time quitting is bad, really one of the worst things in life and being an addict is another. The urges, anxiety, headaches are **SO BAD**.

But today i realized that things are betting better, and quitting is becoming less painful. My clothes never smelled so good, the food taste better, my hair smells like cleanliness. This is awesome!

Things **do** get better.

Ouch!

I'm 3 days in.

I've smoked about a pack a day for 10 years. I'm doing alright with the cravings, but holy shit my throat hurts. It's like an aching hurt, not the usual scratchy hurt from a night of drinking and chain smoking. Everyone else experiences this, right? This is just my throat healing, isn't it? It almost makes me want to smoke just to get rid of the ache (I won't, but this is how much it's bothering me.)

Encourage me to quit smoking

I’m not a regular smoker. I smoke very occasionally (1-2 cigarettes per week) but regardless, I know I should quit. Also, I Only started smoking 3 months ago. 

The only problem is that I don’t feel like quitting. The odds of getting cancer aren’t that high and the nicotine helps calm my nerves.

Nonetheless, I have a feeling that I’m going to turn into a chain smoker. 

Please encourage me to give this up now before its too late.

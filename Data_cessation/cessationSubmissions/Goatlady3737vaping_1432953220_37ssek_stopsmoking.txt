I love my local vape shop

I went to the Vapor Market in Knightdale NC a novice but thanks to the staff and the owners I have learned quite a lot. I'd especially like to thank one employee in particular, Brian M. He can and will answer any of your questions about anything regarding vaping. He is very patient and detailed in his answers. He'll tell you do's and don'ts and will likely have tried anything you are thinking about buying. The amazing customer service is what keeps me going back. They also have a store in Rolesville. I usually hit up both of them. Highly recommended if you are anywhere around Raleigh.

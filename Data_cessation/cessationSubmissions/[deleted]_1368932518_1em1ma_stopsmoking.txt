Had a relapse after 101 days and I'm quitting again tonight! Having this sub show up everyday has really motivated me again. Thanks everybody for the support and stories!

I quit once for 6 1/2 years then found this sub and quit again 128 days ago. Had a relapse about a month ago (wasn't just smoking but also a week long drinking binge) and I'm ready to quit again. I really feel that If I didn't see this sub on my front page and read the success stories everyday I would have just kept on smoking again. I want to thank everybody on this sub for giving me the motivation to quit

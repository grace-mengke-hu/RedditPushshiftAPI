Relapsed after 45 days for my new e-cig, here is my report.

A few months ago I had quit (I think). Smoking was looking more and more like the nasty habit it is. Remembering the cravings, the clawing feeling, gnawing at my being every hour every day, the acrid stench ruining my social life, the whole business of it, I was glad to be rid of it.

    
But I wasn't glad to be rid of the nicotine. I relapsed after about a month and a half, felt stuck in a vicious quitting cycle, and decided to try out vaping.


**Initial Experience**

My first time trying an e-cig was about 5 years ago I think. It was at a kiosk at some mall. The liquid dripped all over my lips and the smoke had a nasty burning-plastic taste. This experience unfortunately put me off to the idea for many years to come. This seemed like the perfect opportunity to try it again. I figured "Well, it was super new back then, maybe they fixed all that."


I went to the smoke shop up the block and had no idea what the hell I was looking for, and felt no shame in admitting this fact to the attendant, who was very kind and patient in explaining things to me. It must have felt like explaining a sonic screwdriver to an Amish person. *"What do you mean, I'm not supposed to light this thing on fire?!"*


I started with 2 pen-sized vaporizers and two bottles of 8mg and 12mg vapor goo, which in cigarette terms amounts to "lights" and "reds" respectively. I picked good old tobacco as the flavor.


Initially I went back and forward between cigarettes and the vaporizer. The new vapor smoke was too foreign to me, it felt too thin, my brain was trying to figure out what was going on, maybe it thought I was getting second hand smoke and was firing all the cigarette signals. 12mg seemed too harsh (I was never a "reds" smoker) so I stuck with 8mg. 


After a couple days I was on the vapor alone, the training wheels came off. But I hadn't yet built up the nerve to try anything other than tobacco flavor (after all, that was part of the whole experience, much like how black coffee's bitterness is part of that experience).


**Cravings and Attitude**

There are no more soul shattering cravings. I don't feel the need to have a smoke break after completing arduous tasks at work. The "nicotine fix" has been replaced with a "nicotine smear".


I no doubt have begun inhaling less and less. The effortlessness of it all perhaps makes the task seem like a forgettable thing.


The oral fixation is satisfied, since my vaporizer looks and feels just like a pen. I can idly fiddle and chew on it in meetings and no one even notices what it really is.


Initially I let the cravings build up, because that's what I was used to as a smoker, and I would go have a 5 minute "smoke" break every hour like I used to. Now I puff whenever I feel like it, which is becoming less and less. I no longer have the before-bed and after-waking-up craving, I can go hours without a puff, stress doesn't trigger me, the list goes on.


It is a different kind of craving, too. It doesn't feel like my skin is crawling. If I go a long while without vaping it just feels like a text message notification going off in my head. "Hey. That thing, remember? Whenever you get a chance."


Without the constant irritation and anxiety I have become a much more laid back person. Problems that would have normally put me in angry gorilla rage mode now just make me sigh, roll my eyes, and maybe let out a grunt if it's particularly annoying. Who am I, I don't even.


**Social Life**

I vape in the office when it's just me and a few of my more smoke-friendly coworkers. They don't mind at all. They know it isn't just water vapor-- there actually *are* nicotine particles in it, but they have smokers in their lives or are smokers themselves so they just don't care.


I vape in front of people that otherwise avoid smokers at all costs. They also do not seem to mind or put me in the same category. This includes when I am on a date.


My family and ex-smoker friends are no longer concerned.


**Health**

The health implications of vapor goo are currently being studied, but the chemical makeup of the goo is basically fog machine juice (sugary stuff), nicotine, and artificial flavors. I sincerely doubt it is as harmful to your body as lighting leaves treated with formaldehyde on fire and breathing it in at all hours of the day.


I no longer feel out of breath all the time. I can take deeper breaths and hold them longer. I am still not used to this. I hold my breath comfortably yet my brain is confused. *"Aren't I supposed to be dead by now? What is even happen?!"*. I don't feel like I have to lie down after I climb a staircase. Exercise is a doable thing now.


All of my senses are coming back. I can smell. I cannot describe what this alone has done for me. I smell everything. And since smell is deeply tied to memory I am starting to remember things I even forgot that I had forgotten.


I am starting to look younger. I wonder what I'll look like after all the tar I pumped into my system is finally gone.


My heart rate is down and my sex drive has increased.


I gained about 5 lbs.


**Other Changes**

Without a pack of cigs to constantly check for whether it's almost empty, I no longer feel anxious at the prospect of "running out".


A $10 bottle of goo is roughly five packs. I have saved *so* much money by switching to vaping. I stock piled a variety of flavors that I sometimes mix together. "Today is a grape-watermelon day."


Not having to open a window or go outside when I'm home every 45 minutes is also very convenient.


**Conclusions**

I feel like I found a cheat code and I don't see myself giving this up.

I still have a cigarette once and a while, and I do mean once and a while, like weekends when I drink. That is about all. I don't like them, but sometimes just want to feel them again. This may or may not be the alcohol, though. I would say it is like drunk texting. *"Why oh why god did I text that person last night?"*

I am not sure how the mods or the community will feel about this post, but here it is, one man's reality for the archaeologists to ponder over.

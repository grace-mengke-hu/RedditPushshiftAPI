Well, ladies and gentlemen, the struggle has started.

I have stopped smoking for 5 days so far and I've been deathly ill (slight exaggeration lol) for all of them until today. 5 days ago I was a smoker with severe depression issues, suicidal thoughts and beliefs, drug usage, going no where with my life, and didn't care if i was going to spend it alone until i couldn't take it anymore. 

Today is the rest of my life. I'm going to get help and I'm going to get better. It starts with bad habits and smoking is the first to go. Along with it is suicidal thoughts. No person should have to feel that low, and no one is doing it except me. 

Maybe you'll find this little note useful. If you do, feel free to share anything you want to say. If anyone knows about beating depression and the nic urges, feel free to give advice.

48 hours without, what is coming next?

Made it to 48 hours without any nicotine. Not sure, but i think this is the furthest i have gone without any nicotine since i started 10 years ago.
For some reason it have been surprisingly easy this time, and have been able to shift my toughts about the need for nicotine to something else.

I am abit afraid for what is coming, is there anything i need to prepare for mentally?
Do the need for nicotine slowly decrease and goes away. Now i remind my self every 5min that i have not smoked, and should take a cigaretta. But have made it without any so far

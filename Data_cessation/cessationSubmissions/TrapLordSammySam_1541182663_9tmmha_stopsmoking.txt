16 days off the vapes

Well boys, I've finally reached a point previously thought impossible. 16 days off the nicotine (primarily 5% nicotine salt juice vapes). I put it off for so long because as a college student who is also in Greek life, i am literally never not around nicotine of some form. But here I am, 16 days in.

I primarily dipped for probably 3 or so years in high school, quit for a year, and then got hooked on the vapes last december. I hate the concept of vaping. Not only is it completely discrete, but it also has insane levels of nicotine. I hate that I hit that shit every fifteen minutes like a damn nicotine crackhead.

To anyone that is considering quitting, just fucking do it. You'll be irritable and maybe have a slight headache for max 5 days, and then you're home free. I feel better mentally, and have noticed myself making better lifestyle choices. It's worth it.

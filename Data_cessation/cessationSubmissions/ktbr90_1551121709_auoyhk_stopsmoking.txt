I'm done with this

I just smoked my very last cigarette. I'm posting here for accountability, as I have stopped once for a little more than a year, but eventually returned. I will break free from this, and this Time for good. I wish everyone here success with his//her quit. I hope it doesnt count As spam, As I plan to post here every day (in the time of dire struggles), like making a little diary. I'll share my deeps and highs of this. All the best, I'll be back tomorrow with the report from day 1.

Day 1 Grocery Suggestions

Hey guys and gals,

Long time lurker here! About 6 hours ago I flushed the last of my last pack and I'm looking forward to a lifetime without cigarettes! I'm about to do my weekly grocery shopping, and I'm wondering: do you guys have any suggestions on foods or drinks that would flush the nicotine out faster? Or foods/drinks that are in any way helpful to a new ex-smoker? I appreciate your suggestions in advance! Thanks for all the support!

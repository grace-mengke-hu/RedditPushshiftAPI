Cigarette marketing. WTF?

Today there was a guy at my university's kiosk, who was giving away free packs of smokes to people, in exchange for their adresses. He was a promoter for Chesterfield Cigarettes. A friend of mine (a recent ex-smoker herself) walked up and took his offer. I told her not to do it, but she went ahead anyway. This is fairly innocuous so far, though a little shady, I think. My friend fell for the trap again, but perhaps she won't really get hooked from one pack, right?

But here's the wtf part:
Along with giving the adress, the promoter asked people if they would consent to periodically receive promotional material, including **free sample packs** by mail. 

My friend accepted.

So, now she's going to receive a free pack of cigarettes, straight to her door, every couple of months. A monumentally bad decision, but I couldn't stop her. The promoter saidd it was going to be around 3 packs a year, i.e. roughly every four months. 

Is this the most transparent ploy to keep people hooked or get recent quitters started again? I'm sure many of us would fall if they received a full pack of cigs three times a year. These fuckers. I am mad as hell about this, and just had to rant a little.

Should anyone here come into my friend's position, please take ten deep breaths and really think about what the choice you are about to make will mean for the future. Turn down that offer, if you want to stay quit.

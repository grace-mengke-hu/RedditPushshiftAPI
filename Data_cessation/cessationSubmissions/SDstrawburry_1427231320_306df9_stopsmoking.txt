This is much harder than I expected!

So first day of quitting smoking. I'm used to smoking once or twice before getting to work, always at least once while waiting for the bus in the morning. I'd stand in the same spot at the same time each morning and that was my 5 minute smoking time. Even if the bus came I'd say fuck it and continue smoking while I waited for the next one. Once while I was on lunch, again I'd go to the same spot outside of work at around the same time. Sometimes I'd smoke again during my work day if I wasn't too busy and felt like it. By the end of the day I'd be so pumped to leave work to smoke again while waiting for the bus home. It made leaving work and going home something to look forward too. I quit drinking 5 months ago, and I replaced my excitement to drink after work with my excitement to smoke a cigarette after work. Now that I'm  dedicated to quitting smoking, not having either of those to look forward to after work is really getting to me. I already want to say fuck it and give in. I won't though cause it's day 1 and giving up on day 1 is unacceptable. I can smoke tomorrow if I want, but that's tomorrows issue. 

I didn't have terrible cravings/urges to drink after quitting drinking, because I used cigarettes and weed to curb the urges. Now that I have none of those I'm reallllllly feeling the effects of the urges. It's almost like I just suppressed the drinking urges and now they're coming out full force. 

I guess I wasn't prepared for this because I didn't have the urges when I quit drinking, and because I always saw myself as a minimal smoker. I'd normally only have 3-4 a day. I knew it would be hard but damn homie. This is wacky. 

Also I know this probably varies person to person, but how long did it take for the intense urges to go away for you guys? With drinking the withdrawal period is normally like 1-2 weeks, so I was wondering if this is similar.

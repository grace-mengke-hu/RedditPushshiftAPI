Why quit? I always make excuses

Well guys, I've been smoking a lot of stuff during 10+ years. I'm writing this to, hopefully, feel better and motivate myself. Recently I can't breath enough o2, I searched on the internet they said it's because of stress.. I'm depressed a lot and constantly bullied here in my country for some weird reasons. I always tell myself that I'll quit later but it never gets better in my life. I always have problems, I mean like a lot. Smoking dosen't help me to solve them, I just don't find something else to do. Well I can read a book, dance, play guitar, design something.. no it don't works as expected. My personality is so weak, I always do total opposite of what I would like to do with my life. Today is my birthday, I have 26, I feel like I wasted my entire life. Why we can't control our brain? At least for me there's no way. I can only dream about how I was supposed to be, like a healthier man with many friends, a social life, good job.. reality is so damn hard for me. Thinking about that make me realize that keep smoking will have no effects for my future. I can't talk to a psy or doctor because he will laugh at my sexual orientation and make me feel even worse. Life is cruel and maybe I smoke so I can die. I am such a pathetic person. Thanks for reading and sorry for bad english.

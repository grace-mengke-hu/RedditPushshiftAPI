2 months! Possible problem

Back when I smoked my parents knew (college student) but I would try my best to keep it out of sight and out of mind for them. So I never really talked to them about how I quit. Now my dad just bought some cigars. We have one together once or twice a year. But I am soooo not interested now. I'm loving my life nicotine free. I've been avoiding it all together, no cigs, hookah, ecigs, dip, cigars. Should I just suck it up or should I tell him my situation? He never knew the extent of my addiction so I feel like it would sound bad saying I had to "quit." Also he kind of bought a lot of them so I'd feel bad saying I don't want any. Ugh.

Edit: 2 months as in 8 weeks. Not 60 days. Want that damn #2 star.

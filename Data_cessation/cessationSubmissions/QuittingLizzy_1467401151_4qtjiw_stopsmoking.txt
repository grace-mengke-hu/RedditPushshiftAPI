I can't believe this is actually happening! - Day 2

I'll be 31 soon, been smoking for nearly 14 years and never have I gone 12 hours without a cigarette in that time. I'm usually at around a pack and a bit a day. Well, I'm currently two days (45 hours to be precise) without any form of nicotine! It's a hellish experience, I feel like I'm lost at sea a little bit... The temptation is *always* there, my head hurts, I feel uncomfortable and fidgety all the time, and just generally feel a bit weird. 


I've taken you lovely people's advice in from my [original post,](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/4qly9f/quitting_for_this_little_munchkin/) doing things like going for short walks - I've been on about a dozen meanderings through the fields today,  drinking plenty of water and juice, and visiting this subreddit for motivation - so thank you so much for your help so far!


I'd be lying if I said I hadn't thought of throwing in the towel, but each time I see my daughter I refocus and become more determined. I will beat this!

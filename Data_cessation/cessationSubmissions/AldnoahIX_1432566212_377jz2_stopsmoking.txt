I want to stop before I go any deeper...

I am a 19 year college freshman who recently started smoking a lot more than I would like. I would go out before and take 1 or 2 drags and feel nothing. No urge to smoke, no buzz or anything. This led me to stay away from Cigarettes for a long time. However very recently (I'm talking last friday) I started to smoke more. Before I wouldn't touch a cigarette but now I'm smoking 2-3 per day. I really want to stop before it gets any worse but the urge is already hard enough to not resist. I have no idea what to do and am really lost.

Edit: To give more background, I live in India and cigarettes come by extremely cheap. A pack costs around $2 and you can buy individual cigs for 15 cents. So naturally cigs are so much more common here and EVERYONE smoke.

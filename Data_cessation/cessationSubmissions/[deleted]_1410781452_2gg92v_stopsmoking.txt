Want to relapse

I quit smoking and fapping on the same day. (The /r/NoDal hard mode for 90 days). Same 90 days to smoking as well.

I am now feeling the stress to maintain both challenges. I want to focus on not fapping rather than not smoking.

Tl; Dr I want to resume smoking until my other challenge is completed. What do you think?

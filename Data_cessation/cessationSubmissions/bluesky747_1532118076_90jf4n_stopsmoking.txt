My boyfriend basically told my friends that he'll propose when I quit smoking.

My two girlfriends were over yesterday, and I was in the other room changing to go out. Later on, one of my friends told me when I was in the other room, they were asking him when we were getting married (we've been together 2.5 years) and she told me he basically in so many words told her that when I quit smoking, then we'll get married and start having babies. (He's 32 and I'm 31, btw.)

He's said this to me before, but I didn't think he was actually serious. I guess he was. So now obviously if I choose cigarettes over my loving boyfriend and potential partner forever...that's just fucking dumb.

So how do I do this?

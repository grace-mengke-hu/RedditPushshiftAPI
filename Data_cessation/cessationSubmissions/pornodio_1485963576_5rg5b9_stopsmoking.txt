I hate this shit. It has ruined my life in the last months

I went smoke free for the first time in my life one year ago and it completely transformed me. I finally reached the objective of quitting after 2 years of neurotical almost daily trying and wasting thousands of euros on rebuying. 
Then in summer started again and been smoking on and off with binges, which have fucked me up. There was a moment where my body actually crumbled and couldn't go to work for one week dealing with vertigo from alternating withdrawal and binging and not sleeping anymore.

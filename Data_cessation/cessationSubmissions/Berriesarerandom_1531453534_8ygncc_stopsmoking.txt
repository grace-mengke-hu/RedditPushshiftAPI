Officially day 7 and the nostalgia train has arrived...

I’m definitely proud of myself for staying strong for a week. And I’m starting to see positive changes already. But I’m also starting to feel sort of nostalgic about smoking. Missing fun times I had, people I used to smoke with. I remember my fiancé and I used to go for a walk every night and share 1 or 2 cigarettes together. Or when my best friend and I would drive around my neighborhood and we would talk and smoke. That’s what I miss, the experiences. I know I could still spend that time with them without the cigs but I still feel a little bitter sweet about it.. I’m not sure how to make this feeling go away.

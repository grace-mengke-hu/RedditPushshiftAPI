Off to the Races Day 1!

Back on the horse again after falling off for the last month, had 3months before that. I'm in my late 20's and I had a hard time imagining camping and going to concerts without my old pal cig. I know it sounds foolish, but if you guys have any advice for breaking the summer fun association that'd be fantastic! Thanks!

Damn. It should be Day 17. It's Day 1 again.

I smoked one yesterday.  I'm getting right back at this.  I have got to figure out how to be around smokers without smoking.  9 times out of 10 I make it through.  Yesterday I didn't.  Damn it. I'm pissed at myself.  

Moving forward though.  I will not smoke today.

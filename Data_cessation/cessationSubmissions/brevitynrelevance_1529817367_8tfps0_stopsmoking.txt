Six months today!

Today I made it six months. 

I am so proud right now. When I decided to stop smoking I was in a really bad place.  Things are still hard sometimes. But I’ve been able to do it all smoke free. 

Thanks for all the support here. It’s been incredibly helpful. 

Even yesterday I thought dang I really want to smoke. But then I reminded myself how close I was to being six months smoke free. So even now, I still have to focus on the bigger picture. But I’m going to keep moving forward. can’t wait to check in when it’s been a year!

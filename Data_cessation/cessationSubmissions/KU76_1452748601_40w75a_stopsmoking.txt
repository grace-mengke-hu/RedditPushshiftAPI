A month in and still not happy, grumpy, and annoyed

I quit smoking a 30 days ago and after the first several days the cravings are actually pretty manageable at this point. 

However, since then I've noticed that I have more general anxiety then before and I'm grumpy all the time. I also have close to zero tolerance for bullshit or things that are mildly annoying. Even little things that I didn't used to think twice about like my girlfriend asking me to do something for her that I would do happily for her annoy the shit out of me (and no it's not just limited to her). 

After the fact i know it's ridiculous that these little inconsequential things upset / annoy me but in the moment I don't even think about it and can't help it. It feels immature and I'm definitely not a happy person anymore. 

Also probably important to note that I don't really get a craving while I'm annoyed / upset but just after the fact knowing that that something shouldn't have bothered me and it wouldn't have before I quit. 

Has anyone else had a similar experience this far into quitting? How long did it last? I know I'm still fairly fresh to not smoking but this kind of irritability and responses I expected for the first couple weeks, not a month in. 

Edit: Not only that but I feel like I haven't reaped any of the good benefits of quitting yet either. My energy seems the same, if not worse. And my mind feels kind of cloudy all the time.

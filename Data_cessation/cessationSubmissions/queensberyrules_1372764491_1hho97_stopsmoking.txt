just like to share whats my wallpaper for my phone

hey non-smokers, just would like to share whats on my wallpaper of my cellphone, it's the Green Lantern Corp symbol, if anyone unfamiliar with them it's the symbol and color of WILLPOWER, every time i look at that and i reflect on how it takes great willpower to not light up and takes superhero strength to not go back to my old self. At the end of this day will be my first week. LET'S DO THIS!!

So my friend and I quit a month ago..

I tried to quit before but it always failed, this time i just was smoking a cig and thinking "I don't need this shit anymore", so I wrote my friend a SMS and he said he wants to quit too, which obviously made me happy.
And I gotta say, the first 2 days were pretty rough, I had a cigarette nightmare on the first day... then 5days later I got sick, I had a terrible cough till day10, a raw throat till day20, but now I feel awesome. I have no problem with beeing at a party and not smoking, same goes for my friend, but sadly he has a problem on a whole other level:
Since he stopped he was some kind of sick, like just a little cold, not too bad. Then last week he had nosebleeding and went to the doctor. The Doc told him he has a high bloodpressure and his bloodvessels are "thickend", so now he has to take medicine... :/

Any of you  guys had stuff like that, and how long did it take to get normal?
Aside from that I am pretty happy about my month :)

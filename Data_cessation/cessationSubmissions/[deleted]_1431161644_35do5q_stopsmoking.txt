Can I get some advice on mood swings?

I'm smoking my last cigarette right now.  Smoking has been my best friend for 13+ years but after much thought I'm ready to let it go. I've been planning this day for a while and now it's here.  I knew it just had to be mothers day.  That way i can keep track (to motivate ) and also because in some weird way i feel like its a gift for my mother and my daughter. 


Anyway,  i think I've gotten myself prepared with apps, mints, activities and all that.

but i am unsure on how to deal with the expected mood swings. I know i get a little harsh if i don't smoke for a while. There have been times when I've cried for seemingly no reason just because i didn't get a cigg when i woke up that day. I've snapped at work.

oh yeah, I work fast food. How do i keep smiling after customers suck my life out? I smoke. I can't snap at them, I'll get fired. 

I'm so nervous right now. Any tips?

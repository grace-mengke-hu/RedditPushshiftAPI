For those of you that smoked for years and a pack a day or more, how did you quit?

I've been  lurking here for the last couple of weeks and find this subbreddit really encouraging. 

I've been smoking for about 17 years and looking to take the dive and quit. I'm worried about how to go from a pack a day to full stop. I'm wondering for those you that have been successful, what tools did you use? How did you manage the quick temper and anger, especially at work? 


And do you have any advice for planning ahead?

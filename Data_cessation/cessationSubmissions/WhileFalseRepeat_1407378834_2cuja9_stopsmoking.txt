One Week....

Lurk Mode Deactivate! 

It has now been a week without cigarettes for me. I've quit several times before, but this time is different... 

I once chewed nicotine gum for an entire year without smoking. Another time I puffed on ecigs for months. Yet another time the patch gave me weeks of freedom. This time I quit cold turkey. No ecig, no patch, no gum. The "Nicodemon" living inside me was highly pissed about this turn of events and he proceeded to make me quite miserable for the first few days of withdrawal. He has become more subdued lately, but remains very strategic in his psychological warfare. I have to admit that in some ways the psychological war is much worse than the physical one. There is less constant attack, but the attack is sometimes much more difficult to overcome whenever it does happen.

Lately, the Nicodemon keeps telling me this is a bad time to give up on him (it probably isn't great timing as my life is a bit shitty at the moment). He also reminds me of all the "good times" we had together. I have to admit I miss the little bastard sometimes, but fortunately I continue to hate him much more. 

Methinks the game has truly begun now. All I have to say to the Nicodemon is, "bring it on biatch". Also, I appreciate all of you posting here as I'm going to need a kickass army like you to win this war.

P.S. My Nicodemon resembles Jack Nicholson in "The Shining". Ya, he is a creepy fuck. Plus, he keeps saying, "Heeere's Nicodemon!" (which I find somewhat more annoying than the nicotine demands). What does your Nicodemon look like?

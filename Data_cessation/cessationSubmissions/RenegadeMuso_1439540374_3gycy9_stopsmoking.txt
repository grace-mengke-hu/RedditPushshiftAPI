200 days

200 days, 4000 cigarettes not smoked, R 7000 saved ($ 545 current exchange to US dollars)

This is the stats on my phone. 

The best of all is that I don't have pains in my chest any more, I can stay indoors without the need to exit, and I my mind is stronger with each day that i break each of the thousands of associations to smoking. 

It strange actually, it appears as this distant thing that surely I was not apart of. But reality is, i was a smoker for more than 10 years...and smoked a pack of 20 a day. 

200 days smoke free has healed me. it has liberated me. And smoke-free can liberate you too. 

You may feel weak now, but know that you can do it. Keep on...you will get through this. 

Strength to you all!

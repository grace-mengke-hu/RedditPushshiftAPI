I am 7 days and 16 hours into quitting!

I am really excited about this and it became even more amazing when I had a realization yesterday. 
I was shopping and a couple walked by me and all I could smell was the cigarette stench on them. I thought to myself WOW DID I REALLY SMELL LIKE THAT ALL THE TIME? When you have been smoking for 15 years you don’t notice the smell anymore or realize how bad it is until you quit.  
That was the best moment of quitting for me this far. I AM SO HAPPY I DON’T WALK AROUND SMELLING LIKE AN ASHTRAY AND MAKING PEOPLE FEEL REPULSED BY THE SMELL ON ME!

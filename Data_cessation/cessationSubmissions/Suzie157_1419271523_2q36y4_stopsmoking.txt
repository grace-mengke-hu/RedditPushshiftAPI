Chest keeps popping??

Hi all, nine days smoke free, never looking back. 

One of the reasons I quit smoking was that I had started to wake up with chest tightness. I'm only 25 and it was unnerving--it honestly felt like the bones around my lungs were too tight.

Now that I've quit, the area around my sternum is still frequently tight, and will "pop" throughout the day, almost like I'm cracking a chest-knuckle. Again, very unnerving.

Has this happened to anyone else? Is this normal? What the heck?

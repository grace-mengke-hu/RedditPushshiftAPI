Patches: Night Sweats

I haven't smoked in about three weeks, thanks in large part to these patches. I am on Step 2 and I've just forgotten the brand. It's a clear patch and I can't see the brand name on my arm. If that matters. I am quitting successfully...

However sleep is hell! I haven't slept well any of these weeks. Vivid dreams come and go, but I am getting night sweats sometimes 3-4 times per night. It's so gross feeling and I usually have to get up and shower. Is there any way to deal with this? I've tried taking the patches off before sleep but it doesn't seem to help. 

Thanks for your info/encouragement. Nice to find this sub today.

By the way I am male, and I have smoked since I was a teenager but I quit four years ago and started again recently.

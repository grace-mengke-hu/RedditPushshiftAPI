9 days and still no big differences

I'm smoke free for 9 days now. Smoked for about 13 years a pack per day, and quitted because of... yeah that many little reasons that everyone knows, but not THAT one or two big reasons.

Yesterday was not bad at all, had about 10-15 cravings, but this kind of cravings that I can smile on, and ignore them.

But today was bad, every 15-30 minutes it hit me, but I didn't smoke. I thought that the cravings would become less / easier over time? I hope that tomorrow will be better.

And the second thing that bothers me are the health benefits that everyone is talking about after quitting a few days. I've been quite active, even during my smoke career (running 4-5 times a week for about 4 years now and 2 times / week to the gym in the last year). But I see NO difference in my health in the last 9 days. Even worse, I slept quite bad the last 9 days. My hope always was, that I get that big boost in my overall feeling, and that it will also boost my motivation on stop smoking, but nothing happened.

Anyone else experienced this? Maybe I'm too impatiently and I have to wait for some weeks to pass.

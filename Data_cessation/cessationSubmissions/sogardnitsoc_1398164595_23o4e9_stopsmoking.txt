Quit after reading Allen Carr's book, started again after 1 year, what do I do now?

I've read the book and it was very easy to quit. Unfortunately I have started again one year ago and now I can't stop smoking.

I've read the book again but it doesn't work.

Anybody here in the same situation as me? Any advice

Thank you

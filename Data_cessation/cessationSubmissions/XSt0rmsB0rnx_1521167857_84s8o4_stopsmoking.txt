After 13 years, I'm 5 months smoke free!

Hey all, I just needed a brag day. I got so frustrated with a bunch of things today, mostly my boss, and was too close to buying a pack of cigarettes. I don't really talk about my real quit date with anyone because I smoked well into my pregnancy which I'm not proud of. I pretty much finally quit a couple days before my daughter was born, I had cut back to a couple a day but just couldn't manage more than 8 hours before giving in. I'm 27 and was a smoker for 13 years! Now I am just over 5 months smoke free and some days it sucks, and I miss it, although smelling current smokers makes me so very glad I don't smell like that anymore, but for my daughter I'm so glad I stopped. I just needed to take a moment and talk about it somewhere, so thank you for reading!

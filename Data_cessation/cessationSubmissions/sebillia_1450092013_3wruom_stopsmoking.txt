Finally giving it a real shot

Im on mobile so sorry for not setting up a flair! 

Last night I bought a box of patches smoked my last cigarette and gave the rest to my sister because I know she won't give them back.  

I woke up like half an hour ago and im already jonesin for a smoke, but I'm gonna try my hardest to push through it. Up until now I've only ever tried to quit with vape pens, so not having nicotine to puff on is gonna feel kinda rough. I work in retail and Christmas time ain't no joke at my store, so I'm hoping I can stay calm. 

I'm excited to get through this and be able to breathe again, and get the ashtray smell out of my car!

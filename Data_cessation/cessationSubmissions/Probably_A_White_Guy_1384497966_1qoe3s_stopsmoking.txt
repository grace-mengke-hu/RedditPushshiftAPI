Can I get a flair for a future date?

I am getting very serious about quitting for every reason in book. I have issues with withdrawal effects on my personality conflicting with my responsibilities that require the same areas of myself. I am not making an excuse. I have failed to plan appropriately in the past and suffered negative effects for it. The negative moments involving me not being myself tend towards aspects of my life that matter the most to me. I would rather smoke than fall short in these specific areas of my life. It makes me so mad to know that this preteen mistake now has such a grip on my being. 


So let's figure this out. How and when can I manage this goal to quit but maintain my composure? And can I pit the day we come up with on now and watch it count down instead of up?

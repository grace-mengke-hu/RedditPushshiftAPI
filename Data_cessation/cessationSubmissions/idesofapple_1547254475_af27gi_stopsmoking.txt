12 Days Free

12 days without a smoke. Went out drinking with mates the other night and was hanging around smokers but I resisted!! I’ve joined the gym cause exercise makes me not want smokes at all :) feeling super confident and happy. The next test is making sure I can decline a cig from my heavy smoking friends. What’s a way to say no without saying you quit? Don’t want to make a big deal of it because I’m going well

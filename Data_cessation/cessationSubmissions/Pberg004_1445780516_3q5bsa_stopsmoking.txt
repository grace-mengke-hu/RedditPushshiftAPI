Survived my first night out with friends and alcohol!

I made it through my first night of drinking without having a cig. I was out with 3 friends, and all of them smoked. I have to say, I really thought the smell would suck me back in, but I was absolutely disgusted by it. It even made me sad for my friends watching them, but I knew that I couldn't be preachy to them. This may sound crazy and have nothing to do with not smoking, but I had more guys come up to talk to me than I ever had. When standing outside with my friends while they would smoke, guys would come and start a conversation with me. My friends are way hotter than me and are always the ones desired by the guys so it was very different. One of my friends even made a comment about it. Anyway...super proud of myself! Good luck to anyone who has their first night of drinking without smoking. I never thought I would have been able to survive it.

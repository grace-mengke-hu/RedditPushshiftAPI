Time to ditch my vaporizer!

I woke up this morning, looked at my vape and said ah FUCK IT! I can't believe I've gone this long with not one cigarette. Keeping the nicotine addiction alive just seems ridiculous.

I've switched my hand to mouth obsession with TOOTHPICKS! An oldie but a goodie.

WISH ME LUCK! 3 days and the nicotine is out of my system right???

A small thank you to Stopsmoking

I have been lurking on this sub for a while now while I kicked around the idea of trying. Officially started the patch today. Not the cold turkey I have seen some of you folks do but it has been a good day. Thank you all for having a sub that does some good. Upvotes for you all.

So this humanoid craving just harrassed me in the Walmart parking lot...

I was minding my business at the store when I noticed this weird cigarette with arms and legs and a face lurking behind me in the parking lot.  I asked if this was some kind of sick joke and it silently walked toward me.

For some reason I froze and couldn't move away and it walked all the way up to me at which point it looked at me with solid black eyes and spoke out loud to me in a non-human voice:

There is no escape and no relief for you.  Any sense of freedom is only an illusion, and you will die young after you return to the demonic smoke.  

I said WTF is this man? Are you for real? Are you a person in a suit or what? It yelled at me without speaking a word: THIS IS NOT A GAME HUMAN.  YOUR PUNY EFFORTS CANNOT SAVE YOU. JUST RETURN TO THE SMOKE. THESE WORDS WERE STABBED INTO MY HEART WITHOUT A MOVEMENT.

IN one sudden burst of determination I screamed out NOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!! YOU DO NOT REIGN HERE!!!!   AND with a rare moment of pure confidence and power I grabbed the being by the eye sockets with my hands and pulled it's head apart as I screamed THIS IS OVER!!!

Still lurching I kicked the beast right into a newspaper machine where some of its paper ripped open and black tobacco tar started oozing out...  I took the tar and shoved it into its mouth and then started mashing its legs into the mulch by the shrubbery.  I got in my car and it pursued me as I sped away far enough to turn the car around.

The mass of oozing tar and paper and EVIL was still coming at me.  I floored the gas slammed into the demonoid cigarette and mashed its entire existence into the side of a white birch trunk.

Lifeless and still, the demonoid cigarette was no more.

I went into Walmart and bought a bag of ground coffee and some workout clothes for the gym and went home.

That's how I have dealt with demonic cravings so far.

Just thought this might help someone.

I live in Africa and Africa has forced on me a rather inventive way to stop smoking.

I am an American living in Africa and I came here with a smoking habit. Here they sell single cigarettes for about $.25 a pop, which is awesome because I could then regulate how many I would smoke in a day without having the seemingly bottomless temptation of a pack. So I started buying 7 and eventually moved down to 5 and so on. But there was a day, we were having a party and knowing how I would be really upset if I didn't have enough cigarettes while drinking, I bought half of a preopened pack. I start smoking them and they were literally the worst thing I've ever smoked. Same brand but horribly disgusting. I finally realized these were probably shoved to the back of the drawer for months, got extremely stale, found and then sold to me. I finished all but two. I just couldn't do it.

So here's the pitch: pick a date in the future that you want to quit. I'd suggest something like 2 months away. Buy 2 packs of cigarettes today, open them and throw them in a desk drawer. Let them ripen to perfection. During these two months, really focus on what these two packs mean. At the quit date previously set, finish your current fresh pack and move on to one of these two packs. You'll hate it. You'll eventually develop a distaste for it. You might not even finish the one pack, but you have 40 to torture yourself with. However, you'll still be getting your nicotine. You'll get to a point where you dread the next cig, but imagine these are the only cigs in the world. Hopefully the habit will eventually fade out. At the very least, after 40 horribly stale cigs you'll have a nice platform to quit from.

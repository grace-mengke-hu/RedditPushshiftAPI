Coughing up blood

So I have been smoking for the last three years and I am 20 years old.
For the last last couple of days I have been experiencing a feeling of cough and a little pain in the middle of my chest.
Today I saw small amount of blood when I was coughing up.
I am really worried 
Could it be cancer ?
Shouldn't have started smoking in the first place...fuck

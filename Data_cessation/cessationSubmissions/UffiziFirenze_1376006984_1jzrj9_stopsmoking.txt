I lost my ecig. guess its time to stop. are these withdrawals going to get in the way of my week with my girlfriend?

I've never felt nicotine withdrawal until now. 
Fuck.

I just lost my ecig. I've been using it constantly for like 4 months. I stopped smoking occasionally a month or two ago and moved onto just using the ecig.

Tomorrow night, i'm going on a vacation for a week with my girlfriend that i haven't seen for months. Am i going to be completely irritable and shitty? 

All i'm getting right now is anxiety because i cant find my pacifier. should i just go for it and quit cold turkey, or should i get some patches?

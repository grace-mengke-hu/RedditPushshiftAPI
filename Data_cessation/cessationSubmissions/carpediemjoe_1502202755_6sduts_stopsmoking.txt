The real reason you quit when you have a kid...

People say you quit because you want to live long and be around for them. That is definitely true but the addiction is so crazy that you don't care and still smoke. The rubber meets the road though when you are supposed to be watching the baby at home and you step out for a smoke and the baby starts crying and you stand at the sliding glass door smoking watching them cry. Or better yet after a long flight with the wife and baby and you get to the curb at the arrival airport and your wife is holding the baby and the baby is crying and you are 100 yards away in the smoking area smoking. That is when shit really gets real. Like damn I am a f-ing slave to this shit.

Anyway. That was me 9 months ago. So thankful I quit man. I couldn't imagine life as a non-smoker but here I am and life is definitely nice and not boring.

Can I get some vape recommendations for quitting cigarettes?

Totally overwhelmed by the technology and variety, just looking for something refillable and rechargeable that best emulates the throat and lung feeling of smoking cigarettes without sticking an entire r2-d2 in my mouth.  Price is somewhat of a factor (&lt;$100 and affordable juice for refills)

Regretfully resetting my badge

So, a few days ago I was having a really bad day and was feeling particularly self-destructive. After 76 days, I bought a pack and have since smoked it all. I am very ashamed that I broke down in a moment of weakness. I haven't really had any cravings while I wasn't smoking, but I guess the psychological addiction was still there a little. I'm confident that I can get that number much higher than I had it before.

DAY 2: This really sucks

Im 25 now i have been smoking since i was 15. I decided to quit smoking after a customer told me they would prefer to work with someone else because i smelled of smoke. In a commission based job losing a customer is not an option. So i decided to quit for my income my health and financial savings. I just want a cig really bad right now, but im posting this instead.

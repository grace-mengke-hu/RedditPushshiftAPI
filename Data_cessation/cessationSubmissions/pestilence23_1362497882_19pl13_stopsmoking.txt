Dreams about smoking? And best quit program ever!

Hello everyone! New to reddit, but decided I would like a community who I could talk with about quitting. I started smoking when I was 15, and I've been smoking for almost ten years. I recently got very serious with my girlfriend (soon to be my fiancee) and she gave me a quit program that I can't fail at: She will no longer kiss me until I quit smoking cigarettes. Pretty extreme, but she really hates it and I am ready to give it up for her.

As for the title, it's been two weeks since I stopped, but every night I have very vivid dreams where I'm smoking and I've never had that before. I wake up wanting a cigarette more than ever. I chew my gum and the feeling subsides, but it's making it very hard to not think about it. Probably just my brain going through withdraw, but I was wondering if anyone else had this issue and how they dealt with it.

Thanks Reddit!

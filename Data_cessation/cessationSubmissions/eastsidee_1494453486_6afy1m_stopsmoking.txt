5th day cold turkey

So I'm 23 and I've been smoking pretty heavily since I was around 12-13 and I just stopped cold turkey. Usually I'm fine with it but sometimes I just have this urge to have one last drag of a cigarette because my last cigarette I didn't know was gonna be my last. But I cannot let myself be dragged back into that pit again. 

It's super hard especially when literally all of my friends (minus the guy I'm seeing) smoke! Most of my family do too so I feel trapped all around it ugh

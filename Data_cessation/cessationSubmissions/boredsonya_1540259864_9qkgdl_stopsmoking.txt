Sigh...

22 days smoke free and now I'm just angry.... envious of smokers, angry I can't enjoy the simple pleasure of inhaling and exhaling a cigarette, sitting in traffic with my only distraction being angry at other drivers, so angry that I'm sitting at work waiting till 5pm to roll around versus looking forward to my smoke breaks, very angry listening to non-smokers berating non smokers, soooo angry that I'm relying on food to ease the cravings.

5 days no smoking?

Hi all! Recently I decided to quit smoking after nearly a year and a half of excessive smoking. I haven't smoked a cigarette since last Wednesday. I wish I could say the same with nicotine. I'm from Kuwait, we have a type of tobacco called dokha. It's pretty much a really high dose of nicotine. I have no idea whether it's worst or better than a cigarette. The way it's smoked causes it to be extremely harmful to the lungs. I have stopped smoking cigarettes, but I always end up taking a hit or two a day. I don't know how to stop myself. I threw away all the tobacco I had left, but I ended up scooping some out from the trash. Yes. I know. I hope that it's the last time I ever take a hit. I feel so much better off cigarettes, the cravings are hard. Really hard. I just feel happier in general. Thanks for reading if you made it this far! I've got a long way ahead of me :)

Friend wants to stop smoking - need your help people! Any Allen Carr specialists?

Can you help me summing up the main points of Allen Carr's Easy Way? Things like destroying the connections in the mind: cigarette + beer, coffee and so on. Unfortunatly she's not good in English, otherwise I'd just tell her to come here. I will meet her on sunday and then we'll talk it through. I've read the book a while ago, so I need a refresh. Thanks in advance!

You know the dark joke about someone finally finding a solution to quit smoking (dying)? I fear that will be me, please help.

I am 28, I've been smoking about a pack a day for about 9 years. I feel like my life and health is falling apart and I still can't bring myself to stop. I wish I could turn off that switch that constantly nags me for another smoke, just one more, and one more after that. I'll try not to ramble. 


I have several health issues that I know are affected by my smoking. The most worrisome are 1. my lungs 2. cervix 


I have inhalers that were prescribed even though I am not asthmatic, restricted lung function and I'm not even 30. Constant hacking cough, I wake up at night because I can't breathe and often I've gone outside to smoke. 


I have cervical dysplasia which is not that uncommon or scary except in the last 2 years instead of going away on its own it's actually getting worse which just means more invasive procedures to remove the cancer causing cells. 


Obviously there are many, many issues that are directly related to smoking but those two are the biggest cause of concern for me. The worst part about myself is that instead of having a normal reaction of investing into quitting, I end up smoking more. I don't want to die by suffocating to death, I don't want to lose the ability to have children if I ever decide to. I tried the patch, I tried the gum, I tried the ecig/vape, I have taken a smoking cessation course, I explained this to my doctor and broke down crying (?!) I don't know what's wrong with me. 


I will say that I did quit for 3 days cold turkey (which is the longest I have gone since I started) and it didn't seem so bad, I obsessed about it the whole time but I held strong. My downfall was drinking, then it was all over. 


Has anyone been through anything similar where they were faced with their health issues or any other issues and can offer insight, tips, lectures, anything!! Please help.

Anxiety and smoking

So, first and formost, I quit smoking on January 4th. 37 days ago. I've quit multiple times before, once for several months, and I've always relapsed. 

Last time I tried to quit I had this voice in my head "you quit before and you came back. You'll always come back. It doesn't matter. I can wait."

This time... nothing. I've had a few twinges of craving and the inevitable "was that really my LAST one? But I miss it.." thoughts, but other than that, it's been easy compared to other times. 

The only thing different this time is that in October I developed bad anxiety and panic disorder due to my job shutting down and a ton of BIG life changes happening all at once. Moved, got engaged, lost job, family member passed all in one month. 

I stopped drinking because it was triggering attacks. 

Then I quit smoking. The anxiety, because of that, has gone up a bit, but nothing I can't handle. But it is also keeping me away from cigarettes. I think I want one, and anxiety sets in. "I don't want to keep smoking. I don't want the health issues that come with it. I don't want to die. OMG what if I'm already dieing. OMG I have lung cancer!" And then I'm having a full blown attack. But even that's calmed down.

I took a few drags of a friend's cigarette just to see. It hurt. I coughed. It smelled. It tasted disgusting. My anxiety said "nope. Nasty. Wtf." And that was it. 

Has anyone else with anxiety noticed their anxiety actually aiding in quitting smoking? Or am I just weird as well as insane?

TL;DR anxiety is helping me with the quitting process.

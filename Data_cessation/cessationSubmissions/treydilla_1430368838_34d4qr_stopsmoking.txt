Suggestions for resisting smoking while drinking?

I'm in college and I've attempted quitting multiple times. What always gets to me is when I start drinking I will have the strongest urge to smoke a cigarette. And the more drinks I consume the harder it is to resist the urge, especially since some of my friends smoke and all it takes is for me to slip up and ask someone "hey, can I bum one?". Which usually ends up in me buying a pack later that night or just bumming from my friends. 

This has been my greatest difficulty while trying to quit because in my opinion having a cig while a little buzzed is just the best feeling. 

So my question to you all is do you have any advice for resisting the urge while having a drink? Or any methods that you've found successful? Anything would be great!

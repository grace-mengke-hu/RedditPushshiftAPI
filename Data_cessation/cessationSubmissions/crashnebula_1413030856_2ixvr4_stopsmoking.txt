Need some encouraging words!

I've quit for two months and it was great. I felt I could do anything and achieve anything. But I slowly started to smoke here and there, and although I don't smoke daily anymore, I can't stay a week without smoking. I just do it when I drink or meet friends. I know I'm hooked and that I'm being deceived by addiction, but maybe because I don't feel the daily disadvantages of smoking, I can't quit! It has been like this the whole year, and I lost the confidence that it can change!

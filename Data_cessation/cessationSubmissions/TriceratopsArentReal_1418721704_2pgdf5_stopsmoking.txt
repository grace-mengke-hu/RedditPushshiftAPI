Addicted to NRT

Hello all,

I was a four year pack a day smoker from age 15-19. I'm now 21, but for two years I've been addicted to NRTs, specifically nicotine lozenges. Now I understand it is a healthier alternative, but it's expensive and I hate being addicted to anything. I have used roughly 8-10 lozenges a day everyday for just about two years now and was wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience. Being addicted to the smokes was never the problem because I first switched to smokeless for about a half year before gum and then lozenges. My issue is with the nicotine itself and the hold it has had over me. Does anyone have any advice for how to become nicotine free? I know this probably isn't a typical post but I am struggling with this addiction nonetheless and feel like there's not a lot of people with the same sort of problem.

HELP ME QUIT!!

After a failed 2 day quit last week i gave in to a crave and started again. My old 30+day cigarettes. With every new cigarette i pull out i regret my decision to act on my crave. But now whatever i do i just cant seem to call it a day. I have all the reasoning in my head, all the health concerns but i just cant stop this ******* habit. I feel so helpless and powerless. As soon as i think that this it, this is my last one my mind start playing tricks. I started missing the "taste" and horrid coming days where i would be "deprived" of the hit. Disgusting!! Plz help me im in such a dark place right now that i cant see the light at the end of the tunnel.

Introducing:

I joined this party a bit late but I thought I'd do it anyway. It's day four. Why did I quit? Because I am a vegan. I am a blood donor. I work out. I don't drink. So I was a health hypocrite. I wanted to be better that. So here I am with all you fine people. I hope we can help one another through this experience

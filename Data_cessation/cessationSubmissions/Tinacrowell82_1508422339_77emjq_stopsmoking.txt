How do you quit smoking? Up to 2 pks a day :(

I recently quit drinking for the millionth time. I told myself when I reach the 30 day mark I was going to quit smoking. I've smoked since 15. I have a vape but it's just not the same. My family wouldn't be able to handle me if I quit cold turkey. I've seen these magnetic ear things and thought of giving it a try. Any suggestions?

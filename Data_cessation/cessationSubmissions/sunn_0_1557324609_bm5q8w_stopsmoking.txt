Question about the 2013 study about quitting before age 40

I'm 39. I spent my 20s as a regular smoker. Maybe a pack every week or so. I spent most of my 30s as an on and off again smoker. Maybe going weeks or months not smoking. Then spending a few weeks or months smoking 1-3 cigarettes a day. Round and round. I have a young daughter and realized that this is ridiculous; I want to spend as much time on earth as possible around her. So, here I am, age 39, turning 40 in a few months, and I've decided to never inhale tobacco smoke again. The past few years, whenever I did have a cig, I'd generally smoke only half or so of it before tossing it.


I've been physically active this whole time. Working out regularly. In terms of physical fitness, I am stronger and faster than I have ever been. I eat very well and sleep well too. 


I'm going to speak with my GP at my upcoming annual physical; but I am curious about my health risks at this point. I see that there was the 2013 study that said that quitting before age 40 cut your chance of dying from a smoking-related disease by 90%. Does that mean someone who was an occasional smoker has less risk than someone who was smoking regularly/heavily until age 40?

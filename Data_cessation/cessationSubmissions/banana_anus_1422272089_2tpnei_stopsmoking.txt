9 days smoke free...

I've tried quitting cold turkey plenty of times but this time, something feels different. The amount of head fog I seem to be having this time is ridiculous. It's almost a dizziness. I refuse to cave because the effort to quit cold turkey is just too much to throw away but the temptation just to get rid of this heady bullshit is huge.

Could be that I'm not sleeping that well which could be down to how shitty my sleep pattern is because of work. Any tips to decrease the lack of concentration head fog? The cravings don't even bother me as much as this stuff. I feel like I'm not myself because of it.

Many thanks,

Fog Head.

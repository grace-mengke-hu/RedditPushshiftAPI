Here we go again.

I think I posted here years ago, maybe a few times. I haven't been on reddit too regularly since then, but I've been smoking on and off since then (mostly on).

Recently I had a pretty bad cold, and since I barely felt like moving, I didn't smoke the whole time I was sick. So I figured, why not just not start again?

Now that I'm feeling better, I'm starting to feel the cravings a little more, but I'm resisting them. I think I'm at a week and a half now and I'm very excited about that.

Edit: ah, yeah, my old flair says 1444 days. Gotta update that.

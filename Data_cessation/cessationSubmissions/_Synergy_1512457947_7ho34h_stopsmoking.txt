Starting Again

What's up guys? Hope you're all doing well. So, I had randomly decided to quit smoking over 3 weeks ago and I got to 19 days. It wasn't easy, and the first 4 days were awful for me. I found myself fantasizing about smoking and how much I missed it. Fast forward to last Friday we had a work meeting where it was determined that if I don't perform at my next event, I'm out. So what did I do? Smoked. And here I am days later sitting in a cigarette stinking sweater about to start again. I don't even know how I feel right now I'm just so sick and tired of giving up on everything when it gets hard.

I need to reset my badge so if someone can remind me how to do that, it would be great.

For all you out there who are struggling and are thinking about saying fuck it and buying a pack, I'm here to tell you not to because you will absolutely hate it.

One love.

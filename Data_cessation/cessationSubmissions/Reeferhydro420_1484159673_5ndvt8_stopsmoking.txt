Planning on quitting!!

Okay so I've been smoking cigarettes for almost 5 years now and am 20 years old. I have cut down to 1 cigarette in the morning with my morning coffee. I use my ecig with 3mg nicotine throughout the day but I just want to be nicotine free completely. However, there is a big problem. I cannot seem to have a bowel movement without my morning cigarette and coffee. The last time I tried to quit, I was constipated for 7 days and that's when I just had enough of it and smoked a cig and all the constopation issues went away. After that I just kept smoking that morning cig every day. 

Stool softeners and Metamucil didn't work but actually made it a lot worse. Is there anything or any product that will help? I don't want to rely on laxatives because I might develop a dependence on laxatives as well. Has any one else experienced constipation as a major withdrawal issue? I feel like I'm the only one. My grandfather also had this exact same problem however

Help

I’ve been smoking since I was 17 and I’ll be 25 this year, it’s usually after work I stop at this Hookah Lounge. I’ll be there from 9:30 to 1 and then go home and do it all over again. I don’t know how to quit and it’s only on nights like these that I even realize I have an addiction and need help stopping. What do I do?

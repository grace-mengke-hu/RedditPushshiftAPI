Not sure if I'm dependent but

Hi, I've only started smoking this year, started with joints only ( in Morocco we have hash mostly, so you have to mix it with tobacco in order to consume it). Then I started smoking, at first it was a cig in a week or so, now I'm at a range of 2-6 a day for like 3 weeks (except the weekends), I don't think that I'm absolutely dependent on it, but I enjoy it, now it's been 4 days since I last smoked a cig and I don't feel any withdrawal or anything, except that I miss smoking, and I've been thinking on hitting one or two tomorrow, I hope I don't return to the 6/day since It made me feel weak...Thank you peeps! :).

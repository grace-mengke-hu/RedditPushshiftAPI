Day two: preperation

Day [one](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/1obibx/so_i_tried_to_quit_today/) could have gone better. I've took the advice from y'all from the comments and am preparing better for tomorrow. First, I'm not leaving any emergency cig supplies, like that half cig, which /u/AntiMe said. I have 1 left right now. I'm going to use it while I better prep the house. I like the comment from /u/gasbitch and /u/tograndmaoswego about getting rid of anything smoking related. I'll throw out all cig butts and deep clean. There is one area in the house that I smoke at. I plan on bleaching it. I need something to do with my hands and mouth, as pointed out by /u/skibblez_n_zits so I think I have some gum somewhere in the house, hands, well, there is always porn I guess. As for support, expect me to come in here bitching and whining alot. I've been a smoker for over 20 years. Started when I was 11. we'll see.

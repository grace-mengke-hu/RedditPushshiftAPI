I feel like a cocaine addict

So, I feel like I have hit a new low. I've become the last smoker in my group of buddies. (This consists of my best friend of 14 years and my brother). 

Both of them switched to e-cigs. I personally cant inhale any of the e-cigarettes. Whenever I try, it burns like nothing else, and I just hack my lungs up.

Regardless, I am broke due to rent. I smoked my last cigarette today at work, and I found myself searching for enough change to buy another pack. This is ridiculous. I want to quit.

I can't imagine life without smoking. I smoke when I wake up, I smoke when I drive to work, I smoke on my breaks/lunch at work and talk to friends, I smoke on my way home, I smoke on my patio. Smoking IS my routine and its literally killing me.

Tell me some of your stories that helped you quit, or some of your methods. I guess I just need to hear that there are other people like me, that smoked for everything, that have successfully quit, because even while I am typing this I just want to smoke. Damn

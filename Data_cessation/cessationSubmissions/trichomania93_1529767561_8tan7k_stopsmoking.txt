1 Year Quit - My reflections

I quit 1 year ago as of today. Here's my reflections:

1. It was my 7th or 8th attempt and I'd been trying for 3 years. 'Never give up giving up' is solid advice.

2. Say no to just one cigarette is also solid advice, however if you do slip up, it doesn't mean you're doomed to smoke again. Just because you have one, doesn't mean you might as well go out and buy a pack, say no the next one. Sometimes the insistence that if you slip up once, your quit is over that you see on cessation forums seems to give people the excuse to quit their quit if they have one cigarette. I had 1 cigarette that a friend offered while drunk last November, I didn't go out and buy more. Similarly, this advice is NOT an excuse to go out and have 'just one' on purpose lol, I know how much quitters want to justify smoking.

3. I feel amazing. I used to be a 21 year old who would struggle and get dizzy walking up hills, now I'm a 25 year old who can't walk up hills no problem.

4. For me, the difference with this quit compared to previous ones is that I truly forgot I was quitting. I stopped reading forums, I stopped reading Allen Carr etc. I just forgot about quitting. I got to the point where I had internalised all the messages and advice and I just needed to get on with it. For me, I got to a point where reading quit forums triggered cravings more than it helped me deal with them.

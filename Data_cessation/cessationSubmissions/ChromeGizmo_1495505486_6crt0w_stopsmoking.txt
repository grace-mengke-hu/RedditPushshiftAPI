Quit smoking for 3 years, relapsed, now quit again after 2 weeks of smoking

Just want to share how my relapse happened, just so others don't fool themselves. I'm 24 now, I started smoking at 15 and quit at 21.  Than late 2016, like October, I started going out for shisha once a week. As soon as I hit the shisha, I felt the buzz from the nicotine. It became a routine weekly thing, than we started going twice sometimes even three times a week, and we paid $15 min. each time we went. I continued that, until I moved out west in April 2017 for work, not knowing anyone here, I didn't smoke, for a week or two. Met some friends and maybe we went out for shisha like 4 times over the whole time I've been here. Than I had a cigar 3 weeks ago, and than another cigar, before I knew I was having a cigar a day for a good 5 days. I had to travel to another city, and all of a sudden the nicotine cravings hit me full force, like REAL HARD, it even surprised me. I never thought I would find myself in a convenience store, buying packs again, but there I was at the counter, asking the guy for king sized large pack of smokes, even thinking in the back of my mind, what the hell are you doing? I been smoking a pack every 2 days for I'd say almost 2 weeks now. But I quit again today, I really hope it won't be too difficult to quit, because I don't think I'm psychologically addicted to smokes, I think it's just physical nicotine cravings. So if I can get past the initial 3 days, I believe it will be easier than when I was quitting the first time. It's been about 10 hours since my smoke, I'm feeling ok now. Smoking creeps up on you, I never thought shisha would lead to this. But whatever you do, don't smoke ANYTHING, it's all the same shit. Don't touch e-cigs, cigars, pipes or shisha, not worth it. If you do start smoking again, quit as soon as you can, before your brain starts to form deeper connection between the good feeling and the action.

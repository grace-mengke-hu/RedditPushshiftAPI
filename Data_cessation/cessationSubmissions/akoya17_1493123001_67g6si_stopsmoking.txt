2 days in

Hi all, I'm new here. I started smoking as a teen in the late 90s, and quit back in 2006. Aside from a brief relapse in 2008, I didn't touch a cigarette until 2013 when a few drunken smokes turned into a daily habit again. I've had a few half-assed attempts at quitting over the past year but they didn't last more than a day or two. I've been in "I need to quit" mode for a couple of months and on Sunday night I finished a pack and just realised I was done. So far so good - I'm vaping instead and that seems to be satisfying the cravings. I'm giving up drinking for a couple of months (I'm not a big drinker but as soon as I have a couple I get massive cigarette cravings!). I feel determined. I got this!

I'm full of rage

I quit 2+ months ago.  It hasn't been that hard, I have an occasional thought about smoking but then remember I don't smoke and the thought passes.  
I haven't had any crazy urges and I definitely thought I would.  I thought I would be super uncomfortable.  Like that itchy feeling you get when you're in the last half hour of a a super long flight. Teeth gritting, itchy legs and all you can think about is smoking.  That hasn't happened.  It's been pretty easy.
Having said that, I am full of rage.  For the last month I have hated so much.  It's like quitting smoking made me see just how shit so much of life is.  It has just occurred to me that this new rage could be caused by quitting. 
It's like as long as I was kidding myself about "loving smoking"  I could kid myself about loving so much more.  
Anyone else experience something similar?
edit: one stupid f*cking word!

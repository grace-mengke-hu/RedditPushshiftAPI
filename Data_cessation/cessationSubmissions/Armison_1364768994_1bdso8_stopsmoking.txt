Sometimes there really is "just one" - and it is still incredibly risky

I often hear "there's no such thing as one cigarette". While that is probably true for many people or most people, it isn't true for everyone, every time.

Some people do smoke 'one' and don't  return to smoking - or at least not for years. My fear is that mantras like "there's no such thing as one" can lead people who did it once or twice,  to disregard the risk because they already had "just one" and didn't return to smoking. Even if you smoked "one" before, it doesn't mean you'll be able to do it again.

I previously quit for 17 years. I smoked one after 5 years and then another 2 years later. No problem. Ten years after that I had another one and that "one" led to 40,000 before I quit again. 

The two cigarettes I had over the years just lulled me into a false sense of confidence that I could have the occasional cigarette. Please don't let that happen to you.

Went outside for a smoke tonight. Opened the door to the cold, rainy, winter air. Stood for a few second and turned around. I'm done.

Seriously, what is so much fun about standing outside in the cold, rainy, winter weather and inhaling tar? Nothing. That's what. After 5 years of on and off pack-a-day, I'm done. No more.

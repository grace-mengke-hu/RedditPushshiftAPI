I've done it twice before and I can do it again

Hey, r/stopsmoking. I've been lurking on here for a few weeks, thinking about quitting smoking.

I quit after 10 years back in '04. I quite again after 8 months in '07. Last year, I picked up smoking again when I was moving and in the midst of a divorce. Now I'm settled and legally single. And I need to be done with smoking.

Yesterday, my stomach hurt so much from smoking (not to mention the common headaches). So I woke up this morning, drowned my pack of cigs in the kitchen sink, and decided that after 10 months of smoking (this time around), I'm ready to be done.

Am i lucky? (No Cravings)

Hi guys, this is the thing i have smoked for 5 years a pack per day, i quit 9 months ago cold turkey style.

I am just curious after the first month the cravings disappeared, i became getting sick (nauseas) around the smoke of tobbaco, 9 months passed and in the last six i probably had two dreams where i smoked and got pissed and woke up with nauseas then i realized i didn't smoked!

My question is i ear several people arguing that is a struggle for years and the cravings appear from time to time, but for me i never had it, is there a reason? I know i have to have my guard up and don't underestimate the addiction of smoking, but is it possible i am "free"?

I can truly believe i will not come back...

Finally decided to quit for good - made it almost 2 weeks already!

I gave up smoking because I couldn't afford it anymore. I live in Canada, and cigarettes are really expensive. I have an app that tracks my savings, and in 13+ days, I have already saved $107.46 ($80.48 in Freedom Dollars). 

I'm not really feeling any health benefits yet, but I hear that takes time. I do, however, feel better about myself, and I'm very proud of myself for making the move to quit. Last year, I quit about a dozen times for a couple weeks each time, but I always came back to it. 

I have also quit drinking and smoking pot, which were definitely making me smoke more (nothing says satisfaction like a beer and a dart). 

Here's to quitting, and to smelling, feeling, and breathing better!

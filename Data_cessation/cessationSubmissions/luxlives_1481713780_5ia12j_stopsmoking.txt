Confronting a major trigger - pep talks needed!

I'm going on a trip by myself tomorrow. Normally I travel with my husband who helps me stay accountable. Last time I traveled on my own I caved and smoked and ended up being off the wagon for like 4 months, it was really hard on my self esteem. As soon as I bought this plane ticket I started craving worse than I have in a while. I'm really scared that I won't have the willpower to make it through without smoking. Please give me your best pep talks!!

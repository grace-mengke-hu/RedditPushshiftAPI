6 days in onto step 2 of patch

Its been extremely difficult for me as i have been smoking all of my adult life. First few days were the hardest but i noticed day 5 and today day 6, I'm good. I stopped feeling that urge. I've stayed away from things, areas, ppl that would make me wanna light up. Yes i still push through daily stress. Its mot easy. I feel like i got this though.

Smoke free in NY- Day 1 (again)

I went back to old habits during Xmas break mostly because everybody smokes in my family and friends who live back home. I haven't smoked since I have been back in the States where I live, and I'm not planning to either. It's been less than 24 hours, and no chantix this time, but I feel good about it.

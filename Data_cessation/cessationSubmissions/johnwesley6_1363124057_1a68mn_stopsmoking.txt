So I just picked up my chantix.

So I just picked up what is supposed to be my first dose of chantix and I'm sort of thinking that the pharmacy gave me the wrong dosage.

From what I'm reading I'm supposed to start out with 0.5mg once a day for x amount of days an then twice for some many days and then on to 1mg twice daily.

However I did not get a box containing chantix that has a white pill or anything that is 0.5mg. 

My box says -continuing month and has only the blue 1mg pills in it.

Am I supposed to break these in half or is how it always starts out?
I'll call the pharmacist in the morning but until then I figured I'd ask here

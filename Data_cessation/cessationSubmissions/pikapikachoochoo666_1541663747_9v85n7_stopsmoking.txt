How much weight gain is to be expected quitting cold turkey

Iâ€™m hoping for the bare minimum ðŸ˜¬ Online says 5 to 10 pounds but I have yet to meet anyone that hasnâ€™t gained a lot more than that.. a few people I know have packed on around 20-30+

Iâ€™m going through with this either way but itâ€™d be nice to have some hope. Iâ€™m okay with the 5-10.

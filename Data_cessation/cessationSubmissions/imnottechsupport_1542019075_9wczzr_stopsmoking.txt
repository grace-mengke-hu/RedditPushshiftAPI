8 weeks as of today

Hard to believe itâ€™s been 8 weeks smoke free and (take away 3 days) nicotine free.

My biggest problem right now is smelling a smoke in public. Stale smoke on a person smells terrible but a burning cigarette smells fantastic to me.

Other than that, the random cravings have been better and I feel confident.  Good luck everyone, hang in there.

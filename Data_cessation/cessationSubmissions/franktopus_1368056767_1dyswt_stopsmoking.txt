I've got to stop smoking weed too, don't I?

Its slowly but surely coming together in my mind that I cant have one with the other. Ive had times where I'd quit either one and its never stuck. Ive used weed before as a crutch and it never sticks. I hit a bong a few hours ago and smoked the last of my cigarettes I hope. Im not sure how this will go but that sudden moment of clarity I get two weeks from now will be worth it.

Desperately trying to quit

I have tried nicotine replacement and it lead me back to smoking. I quit for 4 years until 2009, started again. The longest I have quit in the past 6 years has been for 8 days. I smoke a pack a day. I find myself flushing whole cigarettes down the toilet at the end of the day and swearing off smoking just to start again the next day. It doesn't help that my boss and coworker smokes inside the warehouse where I work. I feel the opportune days to quit are my days off. On my one day off this week I didn't smoke for 18 hours then my boss called me in and I smoked again. This however has given me hope and confidence that I can quit. Had I not gone to work for a few days I am 100% confident I wouldn't have smoked.  This vile habit is eating my life.  It brings me to tears. Lost my grandfather to it as well as my dad.

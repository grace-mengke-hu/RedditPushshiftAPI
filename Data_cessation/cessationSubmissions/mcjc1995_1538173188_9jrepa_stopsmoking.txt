Time to free myself

I’ve been smoking a pack a day for about 4 years now. I’ve finally admitted to myself that I’ve been suffering from anxiety for over a year.  I strongly believe that smoking is the main reason for this. I very nearly admitted defeat and quit my job today because my anxiety is getting so bad. But then I thought why should I! Why should I sacrifice my career just for the sake of a cigarette! Tonight I threw my pack on the ground and stepped on them to make sure I destroyed every cigarette left. I’ve tried quitting before but that was because I felt like I should quit. Now I actually want to quit, like a spark has gone off in my brain. Here’s hoping this will be my final attempt to quit!

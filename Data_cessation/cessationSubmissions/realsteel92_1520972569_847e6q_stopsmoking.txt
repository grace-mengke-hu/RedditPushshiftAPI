What is your queue for smoking today?

I have learnt that to quit smoking, you should be able to detect the queue of steps which end up smoking. As a result I started finding my queues like after lunch - strong smoke urge. 
whenever I Drink beer - strong smoke urge. 
Now I just notice the queue and try to set temporary goal for that 10 mins to distract my mind. It works miracles. Please share your queues daily !!! So we can quit together.

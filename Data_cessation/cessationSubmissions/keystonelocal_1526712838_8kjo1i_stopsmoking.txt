One week in

Long time lurker. Posting partially to hold myself accountable. Week was pretty easy to be honest. Got a gym membership to keep me busy. But today after work I was craving a nic fix pretty bad. I knew I didn’t want to smoke, just wanted the fix. Broke down and bought a Juul. Hit it twice and the craving passed. Room mate still smokes and he’s out of town. He left a pack on the coffee table and I can honestly say I have zero desire to steal one and they’re just sitting in front of me. Tried my best not to break down and buy a vape. But anything’s better than smoking. Honestly happy with the decision at this point. Next step is ditching this thing and I know that, but for now I’m just glad I’m not smoking tobacco. I can still count this as one week, right? 

A little background, I started smoking tobacco with bong rips about 4 years ago with the occasional spliff. Finally got the guts to toss all of my glass this past August, it had gotten to the point where I was ripping straight tobacco bowls a few times daily. Tossing my glass felt like a big step in itself. Since then I’ve been smoking significantly more spliffs. And recently when I started sneaking cigarettes more and more I knew I was at a crossroads. Last week I let myself smoke as many spliffs as I wanted. Let myself feel the tightness it caused in my chest and the strain on my lungs. Then last Friday, I knew that needed to be it. Since then I’ve felt a significant cognitive shift towards smoking cigarettes. I smell it on the streets and want nothing to do with it. I see it on tv and pity the actors smoking. I think I’m on the right path, and in the grand scheme of things, I’m okay vaping for a little while if it means in the long run I can kick this shit. 

Kind of a rant, but hey, this is the place for it. 

Power on compadres.

3 week check-in!

Hi everyone,

Last night marked 21 days cig-free! Some observations and accomplishments below:

- I've always been really good about my oral health and going to the dentist, but I've noticed that my gums are bleeding a lot since quitting. They don't hurt, so I'm hoping it will stop soon. I guess it's a combination of regaining circulation & clenching my jaw at night (also since quitting - haha). I have a dentist appointment soon anyway, so we'll see what they say.

- I don't have big nights out often, but we had some friends in town on Friday, and I ended up having quite a few drinks for the first time since quitting. What helped me make it through was that no one in our little crew was smoking. Also, when I did have a craving or two, I logged it in my app, and then went ahead and told my friends. I didn't go on and on about it, but my friends were super supportive. It helped a lot!

- I'm 28 and was starting to notice some very fine lines on my forehead. I know I'm not a kid anymore, and these things are natural, but I also knew that smoking wasn't doing me any favors. For the first time since quitting, I can say that my skin looks really, really nice. 95% of those lines are gone. For real. 

- I'm still moody as hell. That part has gotten a little worse, but I'm starting to realize how much time I wasted smoking instead of being kind to myself -- taking a walk, making tea, cooking a meal, taking deep breaths, stretching, vacuuming, etc. Smoking was this instant fix that put a bandage over my feelings, but didn't actually DO anything. Real self-care might not give me instant relief, but I always feel better in the long-run.

Anyway -- I'm grateful to've made it this far, and I hope I can keep going. Good luck everyone. Reading your posts helps me a lot.

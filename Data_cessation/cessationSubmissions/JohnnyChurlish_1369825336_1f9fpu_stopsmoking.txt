The best decision I've ever made.

One year ago today I made the best decision of my life. I looked at that pack of smokes and tossed them. I had no plan and really no intention to quit – but it was something within – perhaps the voices of my family pleading with me to stop killing myself.

After 10 years of needlessly abusing my body I quit cold turkey and it was like a black shroud was lifted from me. 

I could smell and taste again. My appearance regained its former vigor. I could lay the pipe like never before. 

If you’re a smoker reading this – I congratulate you for taking the first step to freeing yourself from the slavery of smoking by checking out this subreddit. 

Please quit. Crush that pack of smokes and throw them away. Visit your local cancer ward if motivation is what you lack. 

Fuck cigarettes. Stay strong. Peace.

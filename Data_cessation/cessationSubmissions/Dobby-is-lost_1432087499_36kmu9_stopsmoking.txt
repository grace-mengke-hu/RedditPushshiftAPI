Failed on day 4 using Easyway, what did I do wrong?

I'm wondering what happened. ..I was doing so well :( Has this happened to anyone else?  I am determined to quit again, but would like to figure out where I went wrong. I felt so great starting out...and now I feel so guilty. How soon should I reread the book? Immediately after failing or should I wait a few days?

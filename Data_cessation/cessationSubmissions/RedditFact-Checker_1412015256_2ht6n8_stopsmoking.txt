83 Hours, 25 minutes and counting

It seems to be getting easier?  Thursday night, midnight, I had my last cigarette for the day and decided Friday to see how long I could go without.  It was rough, but I made it through the week-end.  Today seems easier.  I expect it to be difficult, but it does not seem impossible to outlast each bad moment.  

Any advice about what I might be underestimating?

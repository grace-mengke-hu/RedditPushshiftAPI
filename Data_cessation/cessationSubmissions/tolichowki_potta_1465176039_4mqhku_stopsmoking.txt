Ramadan Stop Smoking Sign Up thread

Well, it's the first day of Ramadan across major parts of the world. Since we won't be consuming anything (including cigarettes) from dawn to dusk (which is a good 15+ hours in some parts of the world due to summer), this is a good opportunity to quit.


Remember that you have to fight the urge to smoke for only those 8-9 non-fasting hours some of which will be spent sleeping.


Also remember that smoking in a state wherein you haven't eaten all day will be very very harmful to your body.


Let's take this month's opportunity to purify ourselves.


All the best to everybody who wants to utilize this month to improve their habits.


Ramadan Kareem!

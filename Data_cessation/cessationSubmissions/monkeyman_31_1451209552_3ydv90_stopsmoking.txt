i really want my mom to stop smoking

i don't know if this is the propper sub reddit for this, but i thought i would post it here. so, my mom is in really bad shape, she's been smoking since she was 14, that's what she said i think. I am really scared for her, she is 50 years old, she's been smoking for nearly 40 years, and i really want her to quit. i don't know if it is selfish of me to want this, i don't really see any plus side to smoking and i just want her to be healthy. please, any help.

Today's the day! Tips are appreciated.

7 years ago this month I picked up my first cigarette. 5 years in the Marine Corps didn't help my habit whatsoever. I've been out for two years now and I just smoked the last one in my pack. I'm going cold turkey, only issue is hat my roommate still smokes. 

Any tips for going cold turkey?

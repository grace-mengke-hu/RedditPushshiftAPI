6 months clean

My last cigarette. I was sitting in a coffee shop at a bus station in Zagreb, enjoying a long black, and coughing my way through the last cigarette of the pack. I was on the phone to a friend of mine at the time. All of a sudden, and in that moment, I decided - this was to be my last cigarette. I stubbed it out, after smoking down to the filter. Would you believe, I didn't consider smoking again for 3 days. On that third day, I was at Dubai airport, and I briefly considered buying a carton. But somehow, I decided not to. A month later, when times were low, I again thought about it. It would feel good. I'd feel better, and less stressed. It was a way out, a solution to my problems. But again, against the odds, I resisted. And now here I am. Nothing ever tempts me. A few times around my friends smoking, the idea came to mind. I even had a puff of one, but it tasted disgusting. There's no point in me smoking again now. I know I'd eventually want to quit, I'd be robbed of all goals to work towards, and I'd stagnate, never thinking or planning past my next cigarette. At least now I'm in control of my life. I save money, the bags under my eyes are gone, my skin looks great, I can taste and smell, and I feel good about myself. I pass people on the street, hunched over, eyes downcast, sucking down a cigarette because they're drug addicts, not because they enjoy it. They feel shit about themselves for it. They don't even feel good. I used to be one of them. Then I see the happy, young, attractive kid at the bar, proudly fondling a pure white cigarette, a bright, dazzling smile, and not a care in the world. That's how it starts, and it seems harmless enough. But mark my words - the humble cigarette will take everything from you. It will take away your life, and change who you are. 6 months clean. Stay well fellas.

Here we go again

Alright everyone. I've tried to quit a million times with willpower and with Allen Carr. I'm completely sick of smoking.

I'm sick of the bad breath, the health scares, the money, the smells. It feels like someone has hijacked my brain and I'm just completely sick of it.

I quit drinking a few months ago and I stopped smoking for a couple of weeks during that time but I'm telling you all now, I'm just done. I hate what this weed does to me and I can't justify or explain it. Particularly how quitting drinking seems EASIER than quitting smoking. 

Pardon my language, but how in the actual fuck?

I know the tone of this is angry but that's really all I feel right now. I exhibit great amounts of control and strength in every other aspect of my life, but this one stupid addiction unravels and eludes me.

I'm done. Mic drop

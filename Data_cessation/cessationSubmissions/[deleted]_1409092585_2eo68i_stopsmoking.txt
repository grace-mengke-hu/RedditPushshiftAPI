That's a wrap

After an awesome weekend, I came out of a music festival having not smoked a single fag. I feel an amazing sense of accomplishment, I even had a stressful day at work today and didn't even crave one so I feel pretty damn sure i'll be smoke free forever now.

Thanks for the help everyone, it really helps seeing people in similar situations to yourself going through the same problems together.

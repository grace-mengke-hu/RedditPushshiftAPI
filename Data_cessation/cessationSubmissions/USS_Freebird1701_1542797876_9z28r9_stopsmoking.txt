Day 1

This is my third time trying to quit, after smoking for 8 years at a pack a day. The last time I went 3 months without smoking using the patch program and i ended up starting again. I just put a patch on tonight, I know the first few days are the worst so I’m hoping to get through this again. 

What I want to know, is because the last time I went so long without smoking,  I also didn’t have any alcohol in social settings because I started smoking when drinking in the first place so the minute I have a sip of any alcohol, all I want is a smoke. ( probably highly psychological but I associate the two sooo much). I guess what I’m asking is how have you other quitters been able to enjoy a drink every now and again and still remain smoke free? 

I must add I don’t drink often so I can just stop drinking altogether but is there a point where you can enjoy a drink again? I quit coffee because I can’t have one without the other. Is this going to be the same with alcohol?

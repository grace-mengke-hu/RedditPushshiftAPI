Holy hell, does a cigarette sound good right about now, but...

I don't do that anymore.

I just don't do that anymore.

Man, there's just something about drinking that makes you wanna smoke. And it's never good, because, well, at least in my experience, when you drink, you chain smoke.

Thankfully, I've got zero access to any cigarettes. My parents are non-smokers, and I picked the habit up on my own volition. But, no more. I'm no longer a smoker. I've just got to keep telling myself that.

Oof, and I think it's tough now...wait until I'm around my friends who smoke. Just got to repeat the 'ol mantra: "I don't smoke."

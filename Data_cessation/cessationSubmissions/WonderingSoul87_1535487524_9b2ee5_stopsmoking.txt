Today is the day I quit!

Hey guys i am pretty excited to quit smoking. I fell of the wagon for a bit but im determined to quit and make it stick. I have noticed that i smoke now out of when im bored and i dont think about cigarettes when im stressed. Its definitely time to quit and start getting my life back. After smoking for 13 years. At 31 i know i won't be fully health again till im almost 40!


I have never tried to really quit cold turkey. Or even put a whole hearted attemps at quoting. or to cut back over a few days time till the pack is gone. I'd like to try cold Turkey first and see if I can make it work. If not then i know patches and gum is a good solution to help out. 

I need some extra help and guidance. Ive noticed that I can sometimes keep my mind busy but again when i get bored or can't find something to do and stay busy. I light up and often it turns in to 2 or 3 cigarettes within a short time frame to keep my hands and mind busy.

I have found that being at places here in austin that are none smoking help me. If i can't smoke then i often forget about it and move on. 

What can yall recommend out side of patches and gum that may help with quiting???

Heres what i will be dping the next 7 days to promote a healthy life and no smoking. Please keep in mind i do smoke the green and that has helped being able to turn to the over smoking but i know its only a replacement and not a solution. 

Things i will try:
-working out
-new hobbies
- being in places where you can not smoke in Austin
- picking up extra work shifts so i dont have the down time
- putting money in a jar for each pack i don't go and buy so i can see my savings. 
- finding a book to read or art to draw to keep.my mind occupied and hands working.

Are there any other recommendations? 

*i wish i had a quiting buddy we coudl text and call for.support. its easier when your not doing this alone. Ya know?

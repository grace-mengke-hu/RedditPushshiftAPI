Day 3: Developed an extremely painful cough

Hey everyone! I have a question related to e-cigs and coughing.

After smoking on and off for about 5 years and quitting on two different occasions, I have never managed to stay on the wagon longer than 6 months. The cause of my return to smoking has always been related to breakups... go figure. This time I'm quitting for myself and not for someone else. I bought the Eversmoke E-cig because e-cigs have worked for me in the past. 

Maybe I'm confusing typical withdrawal symptoms with imagined side affects from the e-cig, but I'm wondering if it's the e-cig that is causing my bad cough. The cough comes in spasms throughout the day and is particularly bad at night. It's a tickling feeling in the back of my throat and I kind of feel like I can't breathe because when I breathe it triggers the tickling feeling. FYI, on average I smoked 6-7 cigs a day. Much more when drinking on the weekends.

So I wonder if it's the vapor that is causing my throat to feel dry... I used it a lot yesterday because I was craving nicotine so badly. Or is this just your typical cough from the cilia regenerating? It probably is mostly that, but I'm just surprised that they would be growing back this quickly, a little over 72 hours after quitting. Anyone have a similar experience? The flip side to this cough (which burns my throat and chest and is super dry) is even thinking about hot smoke from a real cig makes me want to curl up and die.

Checking in 11/25/13

Just wanted to say that this sub has helped me out a lot in regards to quitting. I feel so much better. I decided to not only quit smoking but drinking also, since most of my cravings came because I was drunk. I cannot begin to tell you how much better I feel. 

I feel like the anxiety of going out for a cigarette is finally subsiding. I feel like when I go out now I can finally concentrate on the conversation or food or game or whatever I'm doing at the moment and not thinking about my next cigarette. It's such a destructive cycle. I have anxiety because I smoke and I smoke because I have anxiety. Seriously!?!? Add a couple glasses of alcohol to that and forget it, I'm completely out of control.

So, very proud of myself for finally sticking to my resolution. It can only get better from here on. =)

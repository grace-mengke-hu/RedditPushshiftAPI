How not to quit smoking.

If this is a struggle to understand, I apologize. You will soon know why. 
I started smoking when I was 13. I’m 29 now. There has only been a 3 month period in that time that I have been “clean”.
My wife has been trying to get me to quit for the last 7 years or so and I just haven’t wanted to. I always just told people that I fought in 2 wars, I’m not worried about a little smoke. But then my daughter started asking if she can have some of my dip when she’d seen the can (2 year old) and I knew. I knew I had to stop. I couldn’t be responsible for that. 
So I got the patch. I was warned. When you put this on, you are done smoking. My wife was elated. I created a healthy addiction to sunflower seeds. And then I bought a pack of reds. Because I missed them. And I smoked one. Then I threw the pack away out of shame. Then I bought  another pack. I smoked half. Through it away. And then I made my big mistake. I finished a pack. And was half way through the next. While on the patch. 
Ever had nicotine poisoning/overdose? I can now say that I have. And because of caffeine’s apparently (this is what the dr said) ability to make it worse; I am now day 2 into the worse withdrawal I have ever imagined. I’m aware if doesn’t compare to hard drugs, I’d rather not find out. 

So if you don’t want to be sitting on your porch in 95 degree weather, wearing shorts and a sweater so you can be dripping sweat while freezing your ass off... listen to the warning. 

TLDR: Don’t be like me. If you use the patch, don’t smoke. Good luck!

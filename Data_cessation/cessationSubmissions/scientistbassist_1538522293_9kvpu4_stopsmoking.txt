Day 1 &amp; Teeth Extraction

Hi All: I smoked my last cigarette at 4:45 pm EDT today, right before I went to get my teeth pulled. (I figure today is a good day to quit - cold turkey - since I can't smoke/vape/nicorette for another week due to bleeding gums).  I smoked for 24 years and I am very happy to have found this sub.  Looking forward to read your trials, successes and common experiences.  I won't smoke with any of you today!

Advice for dad who spends majority of time outdoors

Hi all,

My dad recently was hospitalized for something unrelated to smoking, but promised that he was done forever with smoking cigarettes. Silver lining! However, he spends the majority of his time outdoors once he's home from work for the day, and I'm worried that him sitting outside will entice him to start smoking again. He usually sits out on the porch and watches TV whenever he's not busy in the yard tinkering. Pretty much the only time he's inside the house is when he's sleeping.

I wanted to try to find a few things that he could do to keep himself occupied or something to do with his hands. I saw a lot of people say knitting, but I'm not so sure he'd be into that...
He does a lot of work out in the yard and things like that, but if you have anything specific for him to fidget with that might keep at 60 year old man busy let me know :)
Thank you!

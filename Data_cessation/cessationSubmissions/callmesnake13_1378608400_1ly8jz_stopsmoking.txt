E-cigs are a godsend

I know that I'm still on nicotine, but I switched to an e-cig and am now just shy of two weeks without smoking after 17 years of pack a day smoking. The trick is to not get the over the counter kind - they will fail you when you need them most. Get yourself a quality, fill-at-home kit. I got two batteries, two tanks, and a month of nicotine juice for about $50. Just tell yourself to hit it every single time you want a cigarette. I was out at the bar, standing in a circle of smokers, and hitting my e-cig and didn't even start to look back. I thought people would tease me, but they were sort of envious and several friends are now buying the same kit. If you're trying to quit but aren't ready to go cold turkey I seriously can't recommend it enough. I feel SO MUCH BETTER and it has only been two weeks.

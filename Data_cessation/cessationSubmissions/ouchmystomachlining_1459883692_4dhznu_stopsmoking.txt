Starting new job in 3 hrs!!

I start my new job in 3 hours, a fine dining kitchen in a town nearby. I am super nervous and on edge. I will NOT smoke a cigarette because 1. It won't help my situation any more. 2. I am a non smoker. just needed to get this off my chest, any encouragement is appreciated, and wish me luck!!

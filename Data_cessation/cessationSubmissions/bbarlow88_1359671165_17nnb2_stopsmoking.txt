Guys, I see a major problem with this.

I've been lurking in the subreddit for a while now, and 11 days ago made the final push to quit smoking, with the help of Mr. Carr.  However, as I started coming here again for help, I just ended up more depressed and confused.  Sure I see a lot of "Day 1 here we go" posts, but more and more I see tons of posts from people who relapse after 5 months, 8 months, or a year.  I see people in the comments saying it's been 400 days, and they still have dire cravings.  After all of this, I'm just starting to ask my self "What's the point then?".  If I'm going to stop smoking for 5 months, continually crave, then end up caving in again like a lot of people I've seen on here, why don't I just say to hell with it and light up today? Let me know what you guys think....because right now it's getting kind of depressing for me.

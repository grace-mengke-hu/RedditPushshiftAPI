Day 4

I read on webMD that days 3-5 are some of the hardest days after quitting. My cravings have increased some and that foggy feeling is pretty present. However. There’s no real desire to buy a pack of cigarettes, and I think of the times I have smoked in the past after not smoking for a few days and how gross it tasted...it helps with the want part of quitting but the physical (and anxiety) stuff is troublesome at times. Which is what led me here....
You’re all doing great!!

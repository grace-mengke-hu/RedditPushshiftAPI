Smoking and erectile dysfunction in their twenties.

I'm 21 years old from Norway, and had my first cigarette when I was 19. I don't necessarily smoke every day, but on nights out I almost run through over half a pack through chain-smoking. On a daily-basis I use "snus", a type of packet-tobacco you place under your upper lip for a nicotine rush.

Upon research, I realized that nicotine is actually a vasoconstrictor, and could limit blood supply for erections. 

What I'm wondering is, has anyone had experience with a direction correlation between nicotine in your system and quality of erections or libido? If so, how long after quitting did you start to see improvements? Right now I'm in my last week of exams. I tried dropping it for 3 days last week, and without nicotine I got intense headaches and it was impossible to concentrate. Couldn't even study without feeling anxiety every minute. So I'm back on snus for this last week, just so it doesn't compromise my studying and exams. After this, I'm planning to quit cold-turkey, and I'm just terrified that some of the damage I've done is irreversible, and was wondering if any of you have any experience with this. 

I know it is a long process, and some damage cannot be undone, but I'm wondering if I will see any short term benefits. This isn't to say that I am looking for a quick fix, I fully plan to quit for life- but I want to know what feelings and sensations I can expect after dropping this terrible habit, just to keep me motivated on staying away from nicotine products, and have it just be a reminder of a shitty past-time.

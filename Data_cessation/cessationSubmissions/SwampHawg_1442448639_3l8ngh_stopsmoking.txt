Vapers' badges should be pink or something.

I kid.  I kid.  :)

(In fact, I'll take the vapers over the carr-heads any day).  Sometimes around here you feel like a moderate politician with liberals (vapers) to your left and fascists (Carr-ites) to your right.

Ok, I'm done making friends the Dale Carnegie way.

Will quitting allievate some of my cognitive disability in the long run?

I've  been smoking cigarettes since I was 16 (I'm 19). A LOT OF CIGARETTES. 2  to at some point 4 packs a week. In the past month, I switched to a  Juul (but I've smoked a few cigarettes since). I'm constantly puffing on  my Juul and I get no pleasure or even short term well being from it. Haven't liked a cigarette in 10 months.

I  really regret starting any of this so young and I'm really worried  about my brain. I'm depressed, have been for a long time. It's hard for  me to learn things because I feel like my concentration has gone to  shite amd it's hard for me to apply myself. course, they're a lot of  other factors (lack of motivation included) but nicotine's effect on the  dopamine receptors on the brain can't be doing me any good.

I  know quitting cold turkey is gonna make me moody as hell but can anyone  give me any information on the dopamine thing? Just as encouragement. I  am ready for a whole life reset. Thank you for reading.

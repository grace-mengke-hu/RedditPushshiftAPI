Past my longest previous record, had a dream about smoking.

So my longest previous record that I've ever gone without smoking was 100 days before I caved, this time I broke that record and I'm feeling great but for some reason last night I had a dream about smoking last night. 

Of course like most dreams I thought it was real and I remember I was with a girl that smoked and I thought what the hell and was considering lighting up. I kept battling it inside me until I said fuck it and lit up. I remember thinking, "Fuck, that's 100 days in the toilet, **again**." Then I woke up and realized it was a just a dream! Feels great, thank you guys for being supportive here I couldn't have made it this far without you guys, really.

One thing I really notice is my sense of smell is getting ridiculously amazing. I thought it was "back to normal" around a month, but before I went to bed last night I realized I was able to smell the stove still cooking something, I was upstairs and on the other side of the house, the smell was so sharp and almost over-bearing, I couldn't believe that my sense of smell is *still* improving.

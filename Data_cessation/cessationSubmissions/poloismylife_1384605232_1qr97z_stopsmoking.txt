Sore throat because of quitting?

I've quit smoking about 3.5 weeks ago and it's been going alright so far. The only problem is that my throat has been hurting ever since I quit. At first it wasn't that bad but now it's getting to the point where swallowing is really painful. Interestingly, it's only really bad in the mornings and then gets better during the day...My boyfriend and a coworker suggested that it could have something to do with quitting but that doesn't really make sense to me. 

Has anyone else experienced this?

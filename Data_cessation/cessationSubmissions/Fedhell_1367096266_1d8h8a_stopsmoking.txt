21 Hours in, Somethings wrong.

Ive been smoking a pack a day for 5 years. I decided that enough was enough, as I was heading downhill, I needed to quit smoking both marijuana (1-2 small joints per day) and cigarettes, immediately. 

I figured it would be pretty easy, the logical choice was to quit. Nicotene and THC provided no tangible (or intangible) benefit, but did have many negative factors including:

1: Appearance

2: Cost

3: Smell

4: Hiding my smoking from some family members

5: Health

But for some reason, ive been thinking to myself about how easy it would be to just bum a smoke from a coworker. It makes no sense, logically speaking Ive weighed the pros and cons, and it makes no sense to have one, I cant come up with a single rational argument as to why I should have one, but again Im really considering having one.

Am i missing something here? I KNOW without a doubt that the right decision to never take another puff, but based on my current thoughts, im starting to doubt that this quit can suceed. Am i doing something wrong? Why is it that I can know for a fact that quitting is the best decisision for me, no matter the short term consequences, yet still consider abandoning my quit?

Thanks

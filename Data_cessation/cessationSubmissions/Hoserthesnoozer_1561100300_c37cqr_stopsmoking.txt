Slipped and I need advice

Hey guys so this is my first post on reddit  and I actually made this account because I need help. 

The title is self explanatory. I quit smoking and drinking alcohol in 2015. I started drinking again in 2017 and I managed to keep smoke free up until last week.

I blacked out drinking during my birthday  and while in that state I smoked a few cigarettes. Now I've been having intense cravings and I don't really know what to do. I just moved to japan and I often go out with co workers after work and they all smoke which isn't very helpful. 

I've been researching alternatives to smoking like Juul and Iqos these last few days because I don't know if I can fight the cravings anymore but I desperately don't want to go back to smoking  cigarettes. 

I don't really know if I want someone to tell me that IQOS/Juul is ok or not or if I want someone to tell me to try to avoid all forms of smoking altogether. I'm just trying to air out the thoughts in my head and hope that someone can offer me some advice. 

Any advice or opinions from the community would be really helpful as I don't have too many people to talk to about this.

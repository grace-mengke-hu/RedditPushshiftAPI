Smoker boyfriend

Hey everyone! First of all, really proud of you all for what you are doing, keep it up!

I'm here asking for advice for my smoker boyfriend. I used to be an on-off smoker, but then quit conoletely a while before we moved in together. I was afraid I would become a full-time smoker when being near him. Before I moved in the smoking didn't really bother me that much since I was smoking then too.

Now after living with him it's starting to drive me insane. I absolutely hate it and I'm starting to resent him for it. I don't like feeling this way but I can't help it.

Other than the smoking I think our relationship is pretty much perfect. But I just cannot watch him literally slowly kill himself while I'm committing myself to potentially living the rest of my life with him. I just can't.

What should I do here? Am I being unreasonable? What should I say to him to make this situation better as smoothly as possible? How should I help him with quitting or at least reducing?

I'm really at a loss here, any help would be much appreciated.

One week through and reaping the benefits!

Hi everyone, I'm a first time poster in this subreddit but I've been lurking a little- I've just made it my first week after going cold turkey last Tuesday from having smoked 20-25 ciggies a day.
Already the benefits are incredible- I feel SO much more energetic and focused it's unreal, I can SMELL so much more it's like I've switched to HD from black and white. And above all I can breathe so much easier.

The worst part was the first two/three days, which were honestly worse than I'd expected- my skin felt like it was crawling, I was fidgeting constantly, full of agitation and a restless. nervous hyperactivity.

All that said, since then it's not been too bad, I still find myself occaisionally thinking "Ooh a lovely smoke after this meal/sex" but resisting it is easy. I've even managed to go out drinking with other smokers and not have one myself.

And a final positive, my other half is now quitting too!

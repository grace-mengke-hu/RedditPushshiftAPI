Today at the stroke of the midnight hour when the world sleeps, I will awake to life &amp; freedom from cigarettes.

A long time ago I made a tryst with cigarettes, now time comes when I shall redeem my pledge, not wholly or in full measure, but very substantially. A moment comes, which comes but rarely in my recent history, when I step out from the old to the new, when an age ends, and when our souls, long suppressed finds utterance. Today on 1st August,2019 , I pledge my allegiance to Nicotine free life.

Advice needed for helping a smoking teenage friend

Sorry if this is against the rules, but I need some help. I'm a high school age person and one of my best friends has recently taken up smoking. She's underage but both her parents smoke so she can easily take packs from home without anyone noticing. She has anxiety and uses smoking as a way to relieve stress. She has said in the pass that she wishes she didn't smoke but at this point she can't stop. She has two little sisters who she knows wouldn't like it that she hides it from so I know she feels bad about it. She also keeps ramping up the amount she's smoking really rapidly. She knows I disapprove and I don't yell at her or anything but I also make my displeasure known as gently as I can. 

Is there anything I can do? I know I probably can't make her quit but I'm really worried. She has a addictive/destructive personality sometimes and I don't want her to be hurt. I've never had an interest in smoking and had several people I know die of smoking related illnesses so I don't think I ever will. I can't really relate to the problem so I don't know how to help. Any input would be helpful! I obviously can't talk to anyone I know really because I don't want her in trouble. Thanks!

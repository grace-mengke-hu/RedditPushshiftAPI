Smoking to pass time

Hello, recently, I have quit smoking. The thing is, I used to smoke to pass time. I have only smoked cigarettes for 3-4 tears, yet I have already formed a habit. Everytime I had a few minutes of free time I would light a smoke. I'm a university student, and between lessons, I simply smoke because my friends do, and I have nothing else to do to pass time. If anyone had a similar problem, what did you do? Found any activities to take the mind of smoking and pass time?

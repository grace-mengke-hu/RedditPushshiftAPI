Thursday, February 25th, is my two-year anniversary. Things I've learned on my journey are:

1. I am braver than I believe, stronger than I seem, and smarter than I think.  (A. A. Milne)
2. My friends and family love me.
3. Every time I failed at quitting, I learned something that made the last time I quit work.
5. Every time before, when I thought I could smoke just one, I was wrong.
6. I was a slave to smoking.  Smoking made me leave things early, plan schedules, and hide outside in the rain and snow just to satisfy a craving I had power to end all along.
7. Repeat:  I had the power all along.

So do you.

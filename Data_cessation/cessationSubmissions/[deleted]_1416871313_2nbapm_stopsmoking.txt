Day One, again. What I've learned and why I actually think I needed that relapse

I do apologize for the length, this is mainly to get this off of my chest. I have never expressed this before. 


Shredded all my cigarettes yesterday and gave the tobacco to my roommate who rolls his own, he gets twelve 27s and I get another shot at kicking this shit. I remembered to set back the counter on my main account this time - it's telling me 41 days but I really only made it three weeks. 

I quit after a mushroom trip, put my feet in the water under an old bridge and slipped out of time into a state of consciousness completely removed from all concept of a permanent reality. I was an alien being in an alien world and my single connection to home was through the only memento I had on me - the two packs in my jacket pocket. In reality I was off my mind on powerful psychedelics under a bridge on a goddamn tuesday chain smoking 23 cigarettes and painting my arms, legs, and face with ash. I came down, the shame came hard (cigarette burns hurt like a motherfucker and my roommate wouldn't let me in the house) and didn't smoke for three weeks. 

**What helped**: 

- Keeping a journal. I wrote when I felt angry and I wrote when I resented cigarettes. I wrote my reasoning down and ended it with "don't be a shitty person." At the peak of the cravings, flip back a few pages and remember why it's probably a good idea to listen to yourself sometimes. 

- Not making a huge deal out of it. I let my friends notice rather than telling them, ironically the support tends to give me cravings. Plus if you relapse it keeps the shame down, which I don't think is a very positive motivator. 


- E cig. Godsend. Doesn't help with the nicotine but it's a far better alternative and keeps me turning into an irritable piece of shit. 

Unfortunately, I got drunk a few weeks ago with an old friend/smoke buddy who I hadn't seen in months and a few shots turned into a pack between us by the time I passed out on the bathroom floor. Bought some camels the next morning, was back up to five a day within a week. However, it seemed like the magic was gone. They tasted like shit and I started to catch whiffs of my great uncle who became a pack a day statistic a decade ago. I started coughing at inconvenient and sporadic times again. I no longer felt like cigarettes were an essential part of "making the moment," something I struggled with the first time. Having the benefits of my three week break fresh on my mind has helped me see that this is not something I should be glorifying, not something I should indulge in simply for the five minute payoff. Cigarettes are the absolute essence of short term benefit over long term reality. They go against all aspects of rational thought and I am trying my best to hammer that into my brain.

 I will not let cigarettes complete the stereotype of my addictive personality. I am addicted to caffeine. I am addicted to Xanax, to amphetamines, to sex. I am psychologically addicted to marijuana. I am anorexic and I'm convinced that's an addiction too. 

But I am not going to be addicted to cigarettes any fucking longer. I am going to take this as a first step and I am going to turn my life around. I am going to knock my vices back one by one by one and I am going to be a healthy, functioning human being again. 

So here we go. I'm resetting this badge, charging up the ecig, and giving this another shot. Absolute best luck to you all.

My biggest challenge so far...

I "survived" the challenge that I feared most, when I quitted.

The competitons.

I like Go tournaments and Maths competitions (don't judge me, everyone has his hobbies). But both are strongly related in my head with smoking.

Smoke a cigarette before a game, after a game, talking to other people. Much more than in regular days.

Yesterday I had a math competition, in the afternoon. In the last 10 years I built this very precise routine/ritual, shower, breakfast, smoke, relax, smoke, buy new stationery, to be in the right mindset. I literaly had a 5 hours long craving. I couldn't imagine that it was such a "rooted" behaviour in me.

But I waited, and you know what? I was fucking proud during the competiton (where you can't smoke anyway). I probably messed it up, but it doesn't matter, the next time I won't have to crave :-)

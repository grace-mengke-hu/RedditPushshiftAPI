Back to day 1.

So I fell into old habits and bought a pouch of Drum Bali Shag, which is my favorite type of tobacco.  I keep telling myself it's for nostalgia, the smell of the fresh open bag gets me every time.  But now, the headaches come faster when I smoke.  The lungs hurt more and there is no joy in the smoking of a fresh rolled cigarette. So here's to quitting again.

My first week

I made it through the first [seven](https://i.imgur.com/M4GpOVO.png) days. It took me 5 rolls of mentos, liters of tea, lots of playing patience on my phone, nicotine patches, and carefully tracking my progress.  
But I'm here. Reporting in to say that I can start counting in weeks instead of days.  

I don't need cigarettes. I don't need them to enjoy a beer, or a videogame, or a movie, or get over a stressed day at work, or a fight at home, whatever.  

I always failed before. I always thought that I could have "just one" cigarette. I always thought that was me, thinking, but it was the addiction. I'm not stronger than cigarettes. I know that now. But I am smarter and I want my life back. I want my moments without them. No more cigarettes. I will not smoke.

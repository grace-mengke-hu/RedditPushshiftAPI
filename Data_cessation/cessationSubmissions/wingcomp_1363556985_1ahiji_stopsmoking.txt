Past 100 days and I just noticed!

I just checked my badge and realized I've gone more than 100 days! For those of you in the beginning weeks of your quitting keep going! I used to check my badge every single day to give myself hope but eventually you'll stop thinking about smokes so much.

Each passing day and week I think about them less and less like a shitty ex boyfriend (or girlfriend)

Good luck quitters and thanks for all your support that's gotten me this far!

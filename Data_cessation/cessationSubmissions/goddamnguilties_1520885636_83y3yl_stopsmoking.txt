Smoking and relationship

I decided to quit for my girlfriend. 
But sometimes I feel she is my biggest challenge. She triggers most of my cravings. She gets mad at me, and I get mad at her....and then I crave for a smoke.  I told her that things might get rough with the withdrawals. 
I know I shouldn't lean on others. After all it's my quit. But sometimes I wish she could be a little more understanding.

3 weeks and have a weird experience

So I have no cravings what so ever but withdrawal symptoms are killing me. Currently constipated and vomiting ever so often. Had insomnia at the beginning not can't keep anything down. Restless even though I have been home the last week. Short of breathe from time to time. Headaches and lack of concentration 2nd week. Lack of energy and extremely fatigued to the point I feel like I might pass out. Been chain smoking for the last 6 years a pack day. Now I'm paying for it. I'm also severally depressed which I didn't see coming.

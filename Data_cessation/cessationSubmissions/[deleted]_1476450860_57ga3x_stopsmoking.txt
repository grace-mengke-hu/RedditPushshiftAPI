What are some interesting, fun things to do with all the spare time saved from not smoking?

At the moment I'm pretty much just going to my classes then going home and jumping on the net. I've been trying to go for a run every morning at 6 but I tend to easily screw my sleep cycle up.

Just wondering what do you guys like to do in your spare time? I'm looking for new things to try. I went to the art store the other week and bought painting utensils. Did my first ever painting and loved it! (I really suck at painting, but it was still really fun.)

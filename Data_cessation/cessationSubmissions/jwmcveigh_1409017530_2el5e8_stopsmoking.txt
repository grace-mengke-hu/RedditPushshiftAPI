[Request] The devil on my shoulder.

I am just starting out on my cigarette-free adventure.  

I have a devil on my shoulder.  

It doesn't take much salesmanship to listen to the little guy.  

He tells me there's a cigarette in it for me at the end of the errand.  

I do the stupid.

Please, up vote if your little devil puts you out to do the stupid in return for a cigarette.

Help me to be content.

Kind regards,
Jason

Trying to quit *again* and need tips!

Hi guys!

So I started smoking when I was 13 (now 21). I've stopped for two years (18yo to almost 20yo) and started again...

Today, I'm decided. I want to quit forever. I have a boyfriend who doesn't smoke (and doesn't really care but sure thinks it stinks). I also work for a health fondation who's against smoking. And now, I'm out of money until thursday.

My grandma bought me an e vape, it has a tobacco flavour and contains 6mg nicotine. I usually smokes 13-15 cigarettes/day. 

I really want to quit but I have the same issue every single time I try. I always find reasons not to quit now. 
For example, I'm going camping this week-end. If I could buy a pack, I would tell myself ''This is not a good time to quit because I'm going camping, I'll be outside all week-end and drinking so I won't be able to quit''.....

This is the very big reason why I didn't quit earlier.... How do you get passed those freaking thoughts???

Thank you so much :D 

PS: Sorry for the bad english, I'm a french canadian!

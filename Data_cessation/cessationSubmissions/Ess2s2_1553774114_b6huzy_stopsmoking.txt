On a business trip in Europe, *everyone* smokes here, it's a next-level test of resolve.

Title. In Italy for business, my escort and everyone he knows and works with smokes. Every day after lunch he stops by the company smoking area and has one or two. Since he's my handler, I have to stick with him. 

So while he socializes, I smell the second-hand smoke and actively think about how many days I've been quit and how important that is. How much of a struggle it was to put the pack down, and how much worse it will be if I start and try to stop again. 

Tests and challenges materialize out of nowhere. I'm tempted every day to ask for one, but this is how it goes, and every time I resist the urge to smoke, I feel more powerful and in control than before. 

Next-level challenge accepted. Fuck cigarettes.

Stay strong folks.

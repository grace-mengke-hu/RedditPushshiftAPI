The side effects are so subtle

I hate that I keep doing this to myself. I dont like the smell, taste, the way it makes my skin greasy and rough, or that i get nightmares everytime i quit cold turkey. 

But im a week free so far. I keep clenching my teeth for some reason and it really hurts but i do feel better overall. My skin is less red, oily, and is smoother. 

Im still learning how to distract myself from the cravings but i wanted to share the subtle impacts ive noticed. 

Good luck to all!

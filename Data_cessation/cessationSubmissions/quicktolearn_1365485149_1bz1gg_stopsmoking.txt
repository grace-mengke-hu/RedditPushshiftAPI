I know that many people will think this is crazy but...

I have seen two people quit this way and it worked for them.  There are many ways to quit smoking cigarettes, and if one fails, I say try another and another until something works.  I smoke cigars and knew a guy who wanted to quit, so I told him to smoke cigars instead.  I figured that maybe it would at least help him cut down.  It did.  He loved cigars.  The problem with smoking a cigar, however, is that it takes an hour to smoke one.  The real help it gave him, though, is that it made the cigarettes taste really gross by comparison.  He ended up quitting cigarettes.  Later, he tried to pick up smoking again and just couldn't because "they taste so bad".  He still smokes a cigar about three times a week.  Another friend just recently quit cigarettes using this method.  He hasn't smoked for two months now and smokes a cigar anywhere from twice to 7 times a week, depending on his free time.  I quit cigarettes over a decade ago, but used a different method.  I started smoking cigars years later and found that I did not get a craving for them.  I can smoke three or four a day while on vacation, and when I'm busy or it is cold outside it may be a month before I can find the time to smoke one.
TL;DR Unorthodox method: smoking cigars worked for two people I know

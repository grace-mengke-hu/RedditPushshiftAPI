Long time drinker, i quit last Sat. I feel like there is a fog in my mind and i cant concentrate. My work is suffering, what is wrong with me?

In the past 2 years i have had atleast 5 beers per night (5%) and got up to 12 beers per night. Finally blacked out and thats it. First couple of days i was fine, yesterday i started feeling "off", kind of foggy. I thought my eyes were just tired from working on the computer all day. Now today i am more foggy and i have a hard time concentrating on things i never used to. Ive been sleeping fine and eating ok. Working today was impossible. Is this normal? What is going on with me?

Brain dump

Hey does anyone else look at their date stamp on their stop smoking app and think "man is that all, it feels like I've been not smoking for ages!". Because I do. My stamp says 17 days, which for anything else isn't a very long time. Like - how long have you been dating? - 17 days, how olds you kid? - 17 days, how long have you lived there? - 17 days. Also if I told someone I'd quit smoking and they asked since when and I say 17 days, if they hadn't been through it themselves they would probably think " pfffffft 17 days is that all!" But for me, this has probably been the longest 17 days of my life. It feels like forever since I smoked. So anyway that's just what I was thinking when I saw my date stamp today.  P.S. for all of you day 1-5's, it does get a lot easier and the days pass quicker than they do right at the beginning : )

COPD?

I've been quit for some years now.  I smoked in high school and college.  Quite when I was 21.  Got divorced and started again at 30 and smoked for 20 years.  Pack a day in the last 5 years.

I've always exercised, but back in my late 20s, I used to run.  4 days a week 3 miles.  Recently, on a lark, I tried to run.  It was excruciating.  I couldn't get enough air.  I can't breath fast enough.

I can breath ok on a stationary bike, but not on something that requires more effort.

Do I have COPD?

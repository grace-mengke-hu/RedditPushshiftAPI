15 Days - My experience so far.

It's been 15 Days, the longest I've been without tobacco in my 13-14 years of heavy use.

Here's what I experienced:

*Insomnia - Still struggling but yeah, getting to sleep is a bitch

*Vivid Dreams - When I do get to sleep, I dream like crazy and apparently I've started talking in my sleep according to my wife.

*Irrationality for only like 48hrs, it wasn't too bad in all honesty.

*Sweats - THIS has been the worst withdrawal for me. I've been sweating like a beast, literally water flowing out of my pores. It feels like in the last 2-3 days this is getting better but it's been the worst symptom.

*Cravings, I've put this last as I found I had few cravings to start with but in the past 2 days they've come on strong. They are short, maybe like 5 minutes tops but they have been coming thick and fast (hence me writing this to get through a craving).

Advice?

Order some Cinnamon/Tea Tree tooth picks from Amazon, these have helped so much in having something to satisfy my now vacant mouth. They also have a little burn which is satisfying.

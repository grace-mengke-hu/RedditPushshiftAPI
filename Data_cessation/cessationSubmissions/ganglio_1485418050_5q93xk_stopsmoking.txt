Statistics on what works for stopping to smoke

Hi y'all. I have had difficulties to find statistics about the most successful stopping methods.

I will make a start, source is an article in a Swiss consumer magazine: http://www.beobachter.ch/leben-gesundheit/wohlfuehlen-praevention/artikel/rauchen_jetzt-ist-schluss/#c380242

Please write your own statistics with the source :D
I would be happy to know about hypnotics statistics.

So.... 
The percentages below are people who are still smoke-free one year after trying to stop

Professional behavior therapy (weekly for one quarter) & medication or nicotine replacement: 33%

Professional behavior therapy (weekly for one quarter) without nicotine replacement: 25%

Behavior therapy self-made (reading stop smoking books like allen carrs and guides): 15-20%

Nicotine replacement from the drug store without therapy: 10-15%

Stopping from one day to the next without anything: 1-5%

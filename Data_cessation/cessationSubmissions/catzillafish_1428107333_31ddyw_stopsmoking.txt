Other replacements for smoking?

So I quit smoking and have had no nicotine about 2 months ago. One thing that helped was the cold weather and snow made it to much of an annoyance to go out. Also I did not have the money to buy packs. Well, it is now a perfect night out and I have the money to buy a pack. It is the kind of night where I would go out on the deck and chain smoke and talk on the phone. Does anyone have any suggestions as to what I could use or do that would help me?

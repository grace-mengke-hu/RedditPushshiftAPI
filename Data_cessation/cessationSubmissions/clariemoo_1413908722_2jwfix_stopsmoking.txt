Nearly 2 months since my last smoke :) Impressions and withdrawal symptoms - Quitting for the 2nd time (no regrets!)

Reddit and these threads have been massive support while quitting (no one in my social circle understands and also this has been helping getting past and understanding the crazy withdrawal symptoms). 


Been smoking on and off this year and feel so stupid for having picked up smoking in the first place. The withdrawal effects have also freaked me out and so I decided to write this to not forget what the first 2 months smoke-free have been like as a reminder to NEVER EVER EVEEEER smoke EVER again and not have to go through quitting a third time! 


Also last Friday was a test: i went out for the first time since quitting smokes and drinks. For me both go hand in hand and was so sure I would fail and have that "just one"... At pre-drinks: people were smoking indoors so no escape from that ciggie smell and then at the venue .. with people trying to offer one... At first I was tempted, but NOPE! I actually didn't feel like one and realised i made it over 1 month without smoking and have been freaked out by all the withdrawal effects. Same thing with the drinking: I only had 3 throughout the night: didn't get wasted, didn't do anything foolish AND awesome: didn't wake up the next day with a hangover and still had fun (without looking cool and rebellious without my cigs)! It felt amazing! 



**Background** (Female / late-twenties here btw):  

Smoked daily 4 years but managed to quit cold turkey and maintained that for 2 years (yeay!). However this year had to deal with stressful shit so started smoking on and off every few months (slippery slope as in "cant hurt if i have just one, anyways i already quit so not addicted anymore" to then buying packs)...  


To top it off this summer went on a total bender = full on junk food, heavy drinking (not talking about water) and heavy smoking (2 packs a week). By the end of summer i was disgusted with myself, habits and how i looked (bloating/weight gain, tobacco stink)  and felt (hangovers, depressed, low energy) so it wasn't an issue to quit: smokes (along with liquor and junk food) cold turkey as i had prepared mentally and wasn't enjoying them anymore. 



**Quitting & Withdrawal Timeline:**

* Week 1 was okay and I actually felt good about not needing a pack everywhere with me. I thought it would be the end of that and wouldnt have any withdrawal effects... However it was just the start (I'm not making an exhaustive list cause there are aplenty on these threads)... On my first quit I went through months of flu etc and it completely disappeared from my mind until now. 


* Month 1 (was the worst): mostly mental symptoms (depression, fatigue, anxiety, bits of rage), insomnia, constipation, bloat & weight gain (at least 2 Kg as bonus on top of the summer weight gain)... Basically was a Zombie/no energy. The only plus side was that I didn't stink anymore and started to feel I could breath "deeper"/better. 


* Month 2 (1st Half): Started getting the infamous Quitters Flu for 2 weeks (fatigue, runny nose, some cough, foggy brain, sore throat... I have yet to cough up nasty phlegm though). Mainly stayed in bed and felt really lethargic.  


* Month 2 (2nd Half *as in now*): mostly sore throat (on and off), still a bit of trouble sleeping but starting to feel more rested, constipation (very slowly...), shortness of breath (on and off), icky taste in my mouth at times, still feel a bit irritable at times though BUT I'm definitely starting to notice improvements: my head definitely feels clearer, skin and hair look better, feeling i have more energy and started to lose weight (In month 1 had a bmi of 24.5 and today is 22.5). 



**To pull through:**

* 2 weeks after quitting: joined the Gym = 20 to 30 mins cardio almost daily.
* Controlling cravings (food or smokes) = keeping mind/hands busy (picking up a new instrument, holding my hands together when i have an urge to eat, making tea), haven't given into junk food after week 1 and going for fruit and/or sugarfree candy drops (but those started getting addictive so i had to cut them out), started eating ginger with my meals.
* Dealing with weight gain: started counting calories even if i wasn't seeing results and felt like i had fucked up my metabolism, and started following a low carb diet (never give up!). 



**Observations:** 

* The crappy withdrawal symptoms have really tempted me going back to smoking, or using an e-cig/nicotine gum. Have been fed up of dealing with the crappy digestion and bloating/weight and would have been ready to get back to smoking just to stop feeling like shit. But then i remind myself that there is no quick fix and it has to get worse before getting better - smoking will only aggravate the issue. Thinking on the longterm and accept to "suffer" for a few months. On the overall I'm really lucky that apart from these withdrawal effects I don't seem to have triggered other health issues.

* When i was smoking on and off (2-3 months smoking and then quit for 2 months) i was going through the withdrawal symptoms but didn't realise it (thought it was just the winter flu) and see now how easy and quickly it was to become addicted again to nicotine in such a short time frame.

* Smoking used to "help me deal with stress" but now i realise that smoking only contributed to stress. Without nicotine i definitely feel a difference and clearer head!

* Some threads mention how time "slows down" - really weird but true.

Sense of smell is back

So I'm on day 18 ( does happy dance) and my cravings have pretty much stopped it's bizarre every other time I've quit I've dreamt about fags and have really bad cravings but this time nothing, not that I'm complaining. The only thing that is bugging me is that my sense of smell has returned and holy feck was it always this strong?! I'm overwhelmed by it tbh, EVERYTHING smells. Things I always assumed had no odour smell now. I can't stand it it makes me feel I'll and overwhelmed. Has anyone else had this?

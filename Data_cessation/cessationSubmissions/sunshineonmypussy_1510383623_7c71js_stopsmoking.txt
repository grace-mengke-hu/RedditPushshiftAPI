Has anyone experienced hot flashes while quitting?

This is my second full day without tobacco, and I've noticed I get hot flashes and cold flashes very frequently. The hot flashes will leave me almost dripping with sweat and it lasts under a couple minutes, usually followed by me being super cold due to the sweat. I can't seem to find much online about this symptom-- only relating to menopause, but I'm far too young for that. 
Has anyone else experienced this?  If so, how long until it went away?

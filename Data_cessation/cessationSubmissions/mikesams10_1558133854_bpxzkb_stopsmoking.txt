Help with cravings

I have smoked for over 10 years. I stopped smoking 6 days ago after a few previous attempts. I classed myself as a causal smoker only when I drink,but deep down I had at least 5 cigarettes a day increasing to 10 if I drank, which was fairly often if I’m honest. I am having a drink and I feel like there is something missing. I am controlling the cravings, knowing I won’t have a cigarette, but I feel like I can’t unwind and relax. Also I really miss a cigarette before bed.. just curious if anyone else felt the same and if they felt better over time? Feeling very frustrated at the moment

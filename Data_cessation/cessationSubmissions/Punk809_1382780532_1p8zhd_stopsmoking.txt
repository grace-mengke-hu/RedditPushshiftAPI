[21 M] Wanting to quit smoking but procrastinating, need some help.

I have been smoking about half a pack a day for a couple years now, and I can just feel myself becoming less healthy and weaker. even when I started working out a couple months ago I have to smoke after every work out because I like the feeling when my lungs are on fire. I can't hang out with a group of friends without lighting up, even if I'm the only guy who smokes.

I've been telling myself I need to quit, I can't do it seriously though, I don't last more than about 4-5 hours. I give myself dates on the calender that would be the day I stop, but eventually scratch them out because, "That's too soon, I don't think I'm ready yet." I do want to stop before I really start getting unhealthy, I'm just having trouble finding the motivation. 

Any help is appreciated, thank you.

tl;dr: Keep telling myself I'm gonna stop smoking, but always go back on my word.

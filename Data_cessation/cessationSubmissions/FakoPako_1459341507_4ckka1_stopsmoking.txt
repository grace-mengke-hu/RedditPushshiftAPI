89 Days! Where are you New Year quitters?

This has to be the longest kept New Years resolution lol. 89 days today. Tomorrow, 3 months. I hope all other New Year quitters are still here! 

I feel great! I don't think about smoking anymore. I don't want it. I don't crave it. I am done with it. My face complexion is soooo much better. My skin just looks better. My teeth and my mouth feel so fresh and clean. I love it! 

Keep it up everyone! This is totally worth it. If you are on a day 2, 3 or 4...just keep at it! You can do it. Once you get past the first couple of weeks, it gets lot easier. I stopped drinking alcohol during my first month and that helped. Hell, I didn't hang out with any of my friends because I didn't want to be around it. Now, I am free of it all! I love it. 

Keep going peeps! You got this shit!

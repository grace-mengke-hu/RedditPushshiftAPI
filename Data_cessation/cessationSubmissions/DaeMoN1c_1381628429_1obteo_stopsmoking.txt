Ok, Time to quit

Title is really self explanatory really but a bit of backround for those of you who care to read it. Smoked since I was 14, now 21. Parent's have known I smoke since I was 16 (the legal age in the UK at the time) and my dad has always given me shit for it. Pneumonia a year or two ago and sleep apnoea are the real reason I've decided to quit. I'm also a "big" guy. 
  
So kinda put all that together and that's mainly why I decided to stop. It would make my already bad lungs more tolerable and hopefully give me a bit more energy. Recently gotten into Airsoft as well. Running around all day with all that gear on really takes a lot of out the fat smokers. 
  
I haven't read any books on the subject, that includes this subreddits "go-to" book. I have some nicotine spray stuff (tastes horrible) and the gum. But if at all possible I plan to just stop with no nicotine substitute. 
  
Feel free to throw out any advice you feel I need to hear and ask any questions you want. 
  
I guess I'll throw up an update every so often if anyone is actually interested :)

One year cigarette free. A little proud.

I'm part of the quit via vaping. (I know, boo at me, etc etc)

I was smoking 25g of tobacco every 2 days and quit over night via vaping.

I have recently started to move my nicotine levels down (2.4% to 1.8%) and plan to continue moving down to 0 over the next year or 2.

So, yeah, one year done. Woop woop.

Edit - forgot to mention, not even tempted anymore.  Someone thought I was still a smoker so gave me 3 packs as they are from China and it is dirt cheap over there.  Got put in the boot of my car, I forget they are even there; that's how little I care about smoking now.

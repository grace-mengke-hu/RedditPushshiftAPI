Finally used to it!

Hung out all day with one of my buddies who smokes, it seemed crazy and disgusting how many times he went out for a smoke break, and I remembered I went out just as many times when I smoked. Even when he was sitting there puffing away I couldn't care less. I didn't even have a craving! I feel normal again!

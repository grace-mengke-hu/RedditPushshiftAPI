Attempt number 2 (with a deadline)

The first time I quit, I used chantix and it was a breeze. However, social spaces that visit regularly had me cave around finals week and here we are. I'm not back up to my pack-a-day that I was at prior to the last attempt, but I feel like I'm cherishing every cigarette more than before because I don't know when my last one will be. 

I have until friday to quit, which is when I get InvisAlign and its mandatory to be a non-smoker because moving teeth and gums while smoking can cause huge problems with healing and staving off infection. So, Friday it is. I'm taking the leftover Chantix to help, but its making me really sick because I jumped right back in rather than incrementally dosing up. Anyway, yesterday I had 5, today I'll have 4, tomorrow 3, thursday 2, and Friday I'll have my last one. At least that's what I tell myself. 

I really don't want to quit, but I'm also fully committed to my dental endeavor. Smoking is a part of me, of my personality and its hard in that regard. It clears my head when work is slow. My boyfriend smokes and we bond over a post-coitus smoke. I hate this but I have to do it and I think I'll be really ready once I'm over the emotional bond.

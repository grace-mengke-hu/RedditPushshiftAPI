I didn't think it'd work but it does! (The patch)

So my school, has a free stop smoking program for students. I got a bunch of patches & gum. It works, I'm currently out of smokes so I stuck the patch (14mg) on just to give it a go and help with the cravings, and I've had 2.5 smokes today and a gum chew when it was almost my break at work and couldn't smoke. I still want an actual cigarette but it's really working! I'm not crawling up the walls and depressed about being broke/smokeless. 
I'm currently reducing but it's so nice to know that it's working for me. 

I'd also like to thank everyone for posting their stories, it's helped me so much with deciding to quit!

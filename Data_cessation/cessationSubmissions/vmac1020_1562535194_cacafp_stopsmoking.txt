On the patch and exhausted

Hey everyone ! So I have quit smoking before twice. Once for 6 months using a vape but it was so easy to start smoking again. This time I am using Nicoderm patches and the spray (not an inhaler). Anyways I am exhausted all the time. Like sleeping for 10 hours at night plus crashing for a few hours during the day. I started 4 weeks ago and it seemed to start immediately. After a couple weeks I took it off for a couple of days and smoked (I know, bad choice) but I wasn’t tired at all! So since nicotine is a stimulant and I’m getting that constantly on the patch, and fatigue isn’t a listed side effect, I’m wondering if this has happened to anyone else? Or if anyone has any ideas on how to fight it ?

Smokers Cough

Over the weekend, I had my best girlfriend from college come and stay with me and my husband. She is a pack a day smoker and has no plans to quit at the moment. Throughout the weekend, she was constantly coughing and gasping for air. She would then find every excuse in the book to blame the cough on rather than admit that it was from smoking. She is only 30 and already has a constant cough. 

I just wish she could realize how much the cigs have already affected her health but I realize that she will quit when she wants to quit.

Anyone else glad that they no longer hack up their lungs everytime they move?

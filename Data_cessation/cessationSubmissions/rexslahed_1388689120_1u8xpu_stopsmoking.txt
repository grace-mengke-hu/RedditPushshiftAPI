Shit Shit Shit! Help!

Its been 36 hours and 42 minutes since I quit on new years.
Reference my prev post here:http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/1u1e78/the_one_thing_preventing_me_from_quitting/

On the 27th of December, as I was getting mentally prepared to quit on New Years, I placed an order for Honeyrose Menthol cigarettes on Amazon and totally forgot about it. I assumed that would help me quit and was safer since it is nicotine and tobacco free. Heres a picture of the dam thing: http://imgur.com/haMnV0I

I totally forgot about the dam thing. I just finished lunch with my coworkers and see the package sitting on my desk! Now I cant wait to go home and try it out. But I dont want to do it at the same time either. Im in a fix, someone please bitch slap the shit out of me. Ive had mad craving these past 36 hours but I remained 100% clean. 

If I smoke these herbal cigarettes, it will be a personal defeat. What Do i do? Help please..

Maybe a post 5 days ago about quiting cold turkey i am now on day 9

Every since i made that post i've been doing well not looking back i find my breathing is already starting to improve, im not so tired from walking anymore and feel i have more energy, although my sleep patterns are still the same i think its just me staying up late to browse the net.
 
My cravings havn't been bad i usually have one about this time of day for maybe a couple minutes but find myself quickly getting past it. 

So after 15 years im happy with my decision of quiting, next benchmark is 30 days. Lets do this.

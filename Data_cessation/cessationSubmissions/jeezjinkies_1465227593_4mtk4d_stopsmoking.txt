Quitting with SO?

An acquaintance of me and my husband died last week from a heart attack at age 30... he was a smoker. I have tried to quit a few times, always gave in after a week or so because being around smokers was difficult for me. My husband is now motivated to quit and we set a quit date of July 5th. Has anyone had experience quitting with another person? Has it been helpful? Any drawbacks or advice you can give me?

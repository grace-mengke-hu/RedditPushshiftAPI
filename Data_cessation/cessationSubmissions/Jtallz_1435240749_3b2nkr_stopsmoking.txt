Now or never

Long time lurker,  first time poster.  15 years a smoker... more than half my life.  I'm not yet 30 and have to sleep sitting up because of occasional pleurisy pain.  Nicotine withdrawal sucks the enjoyment out of time with my kids. Shortness of breath means I can't play with them the way I should.  I'm highly educated and willfully ignore my better judgments in regards to using nicotine.  The time is now. No more excuses.

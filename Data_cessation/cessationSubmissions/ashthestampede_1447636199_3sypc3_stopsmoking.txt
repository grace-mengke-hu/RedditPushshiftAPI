Weird dreams

I'm still not sure if it's the champix or the fact I haven't had a smoke in 12 days, but damn, the dreams are strange.

I wake up every morning and I've clearly been exorcising demons with how the sheets and covers end up. The dreams are strange but not noteworthy, mostly strange. Anyone else had similar experiences?

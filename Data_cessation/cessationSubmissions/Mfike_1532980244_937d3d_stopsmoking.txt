1.5 Years Smoke Free

At age 34 I realized I had been smoking for 1/2 of my life! I had to quit- I knew it would be hard- I was afraid to put in the hard work, grit and sacrifice to quit (I had made 1/2 ass attempts to quit before). But I did it- and if I could do it- you can too!
For people who don’t see a light at the end, YET, here’s what helped me-
1- Smoke Free App. I logged into that app 50 times per day to check progress or log cravings
2- this thread helped immensely. Instead of smoking while mindlessly scrolling on my phone, I read this thread
3- I made a commitment to not smoke while drinking- ever. That if I was going to smoke again I would do so with a sober mind. The sober me that white knuckled those first weeks deserved that.
4- icebreaker mints and cold water were my best friends initially 
Things I have learned-
1- I was not prepared for the depression I felt initially after quitting. Maybe I should have gotten a prescription for Wellbutrin but I wanted to quit cold turkey (which I did 👍🏼)
2- I didn’t think I would STILL have cravings to smoke at this point. It’s not every day or even every week. But when the craving hits it’s so strong (luckily it only lasts a couple minutes) the fight to be smoke free at least lasts 1.5 years!
3- being smoke free was so worth the hard work! 

I was especially grateful to be smoke free earlier this summer when I took my daughters to Dinsey World. I could travel by plane, walk the parks all day, and be in the moment! If I would have still been smoking I would be planning my next smoke break instead of the next Fastpass! 

For all of you starting the journey - you can do it! It’s not easy- but it IS possible!!!

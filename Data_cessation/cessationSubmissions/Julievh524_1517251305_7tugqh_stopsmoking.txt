1 month

I made it a month, whoo hoo! I had a dream last night that I bought a pack and smoked the whole thing in a night. Woke up relieved it was just a dream and I hadn't actually done that. Cravings are almost nonexistent and fewer and fewer dreams about smoking as well. Can only get better from here. 😁

Day 4 worst yet?

Day one was all about the craving, day two was about pumping up my motivation to stick with it. Day three (. 1st work day) and the munchies hit with a little headache and sleepiness.

Day 4... Full blown headache, running in circles and my lungs feel like sand paper. This one has been the worst so far. NTAP tho!

I have a problem

Hello, I need some advice. I am not a heavy smoker, never more than 8 or 9 cigarettes a day, but I want to quit. The thing is that, although a part of me wants to quit, another part thinks "it's not that big of a deal", and it keeps going back and forth between the two. Did any of you feel like this before quitting? And if so, what did you do?
Thank you.

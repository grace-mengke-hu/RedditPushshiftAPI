Hey Guys, I've been sick for a week and a half. What can I do to prevent this in the future?

Hey everyone--

This is something I don't think most smokers are prepared for when quitting. For me this is another attempt at quitting smoking. I have gotten sick in the past when I quit, but nothing like this. I have been using the lozenges, they really help.

I quit 2 weeks ago, and about 4 days into it, I got an extreme sore throat and lost my voice. Then I got the whole gamut of general cold symptoms (inflamed sinuses, body aches, extreme fatigue, painful coughing up stuff in the morning, incessant dry cough at night, face pain, gum pain, pressure headaches). I'm surprisingly not clogged up, I have the ability to breath but my chest feels tight. Stuff is coming out though. Gross.

I have heard it is normal to get a "quitter's flu," but I think I got another illness on top of it due to my immune system being confused by the lack of substances in cigarettes. I have heard your immune functioning can be lowered for months after quitting.

My question is, how do I prevent getting super sick again? Does anyone take Echinacea? I drink a lot of herbal teas and have been drinking a detox tea. Maybe it's my body going through extreme detoxification. I haven't been able to exercise I've been so fatigued. Any thoughts are appreciated. I did go to the doctor and they just told me to take Advil Cold & Sinus which has been helping.

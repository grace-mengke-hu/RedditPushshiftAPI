It's been 55 hours and I'm having a hard time.

I'm on day 3. I'm a server and about to go into work, I don't know how I'm gonna make it tonight. 
I've been fidgety and sweating all day today. Literally chewing on everything and unable to get out of bed. I feel like I'm going crazy and I need some motivation!

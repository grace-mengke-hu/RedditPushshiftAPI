Day 6!

I quit smoking officially six days ago. I have been smoking for 8 years since I was 15 and its just not worth it anymore. I've become too paranoid with my health and every little thing makes me feel like I'm going to have some kind of cancer or disease if I continue smoking. I guess I'm a hypochondriac lol. Anyways it's been 6 days for me and I've been great. I took Nicorette for three days than it gave me bad heart palpitations so ive been cold turkey ever since. The only thing that sucks are getting use to my routines without a smoke, or even my emotions without one. Any advice for that?

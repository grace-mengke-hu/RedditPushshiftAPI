Week 3 of Tapering Method

I've been using the tapering method to quit smoking.    
I'm on week 3 right now. I was smoking about one every hour, and starting today, I'm smoking one every 4.5 hours.   
I was wondering what y'all's opinion is on this method, and if any of you have had any luck with it.

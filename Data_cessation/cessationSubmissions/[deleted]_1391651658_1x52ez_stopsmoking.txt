It's only been 8 hours since my last smoke, I need some help and tips with social situations.

Hey reddit,

So it's only been 8 hours since my last cigarette. I haven't craved one as of yet, but I know that tomorrow will be the worst day, and I have an EXTREMELY stressful job, so I'm not looking forward to that! Anyways, in about a month I'm going on vacation with friends where we'll be backpacking, going to pubs, hostels and they all smoke. I'm a really anxious traveller myself, so any tips on how to push through? I think my main issue will be when I'm drinking beer, which will happen a few times throughout my trip.

To be honest, I've gone back and forth with whether I should wait until after my trip to quit? Or just push through now. I don't want to be even more stressed out while backpacking. 

Thanks!

I was taking apple cider vinegar to help clean my liver and it made my cigerattes taste so horrible...(this is not a medication) Fermented apples!

My friend Pete told me to get some apple cider vinegar because it can help cleanse your body as a natuaral supplement....so I went to the store and bought the 99 cent cheap shit, it cleaned me out and a big plus is it makes my cigs taste like shit to the point where I had to quit....have you ever picked up a cig after being on the patch for a while, thats what it tastes like.....so if you can handle the once a day absolutley gross taste of Apple cider vinegar, maybe it will help you with smoking.......

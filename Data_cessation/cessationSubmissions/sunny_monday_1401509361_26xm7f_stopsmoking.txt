The start of a new month...

It was the beginning of May - 4 weeks ago - when I purchased my first vape. Ive used it on/off all month. My goal was to wean off of real cigarettes, and still end up under budget for the month.

Well, I ended up slightly over budget for smokes for the month because of the initial vape investment, and individual packs are more expensive than the cartons I was buying. BUT... I did definitely smoke less actual cigarettes this month.

Yesterday as I was making the budget for June, I actually allocated MORE dollars to smoking because, well, Ill still need to buy packs, right? 

Today.. fuck that. I redid the budget. Lowered that smoking category to the lowest possible to still afford ejuice/atomizers. Failure is not an option.

June's goal is to NOT buy/bum/smoke any real cigarettes at all.

It has been a whopping two days of vape only for me so far, and... Im feening. Ive had waay too much to eat today, and Ive drunk what feels like gallons of water, and Ive washed my face/brushed my teeth today more times than I care to admit. Still, Im going to bed and calling today a win. Tomorrow is a new day.

tl;dr Made progress this month but not quit yet. June is about to start and Im recommitting to quitting.

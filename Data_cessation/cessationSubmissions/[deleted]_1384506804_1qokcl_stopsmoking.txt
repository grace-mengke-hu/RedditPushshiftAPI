Observations at 34 days

(I have never quit for more than a day before. This is amazing)

Cravings are much much more manageable. I get annoyed at them, really. I never want a cigarette-I just want the feeling of wanting one to go away. That amazes me, honestly. I used to think I loved smoking (2 packs a day most of the time because I *loved* it so much).  Now it seems kind of dumb.  But the cravings aren't bad anymore. I just remember times when I would usually light up, pause for a minute to let the thought drift away, and go on with life. 

Anniversary days are hard. 3 days, 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 1 month....all were stressful. Brain keeps being dumb and wanting me to reward myself for not smoking....by smoking. No way. I prefer these uneventful days...Day 34 doesn't mean anything special. 

Work is easier. You may have a job where you have tons of cigarette breaks. Maybe you have a job where you aren't allowed to smoke. No matter what, there was a part of your brain just jonesing for the next break. I can relax at work more now. 

I have gained about 4 pounds. I gained it all in the first week and no more than that (wasn't sure if I was going to keep gaining! It was scary). 4 lbs is ok. It'll go away. My appetite is really settling down now. 

My smoker friends don't care about my quit. I assume it is similar to the way I thought about non-smokers when I smoked. I felt vaguely embarrassed to smell bad and leave places to go smoke all the time.

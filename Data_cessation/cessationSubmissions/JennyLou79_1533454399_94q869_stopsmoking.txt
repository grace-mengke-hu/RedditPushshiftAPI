Chantix with Antidepressants

Anyone have experience with taking Chantix while on or temporarily off antidepressants or anxiety meds? I would really like to try Chantix, but a couple psychiatrists have said they don't recommend taking it while I'm on Escitalopram (Lexapro). Backstory: I've had a few suicide attempts in my life, and mental illness runs in my family, so my doctor agrees that I shouldn't go off my meds, since this particular one has been the only one to help, and I've been on it 5+ years with no episodes. I've smoked 1/2 pack - 1 pack a day for 20 years, tried to quit countless times cold turkey, cutting down slowly, the patch, the gum... nothing stuck. My dad quit successfully using Chantix after smoking over 50 years. Advice?

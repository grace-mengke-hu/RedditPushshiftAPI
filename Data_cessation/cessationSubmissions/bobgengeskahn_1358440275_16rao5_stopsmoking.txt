Tomorrow will be day 1...

Hello r/stopsmoking,

I've been lurking here for a while and it has gotten me motivated to set up a plan.  Life on the other hand has given me an opportunity, and I'm going to jump on it.  I'm getting my wisdom teeth removed tomorrow morning, so tonight will be my last smoke.  

I've spent the last few weeks focusing on when/why I smoke and thinking about how I will combat these triggers.  However, I have one that I cant figure out.  Often times I use smoking as a break to slow my brain down from studying.  Work, driving, even boredom aren't that big of a deal.  But after 1.5-2 hours of reading or writing I just start thinking about smoking, and the more I fidget the sooner I feel the need to take a smoke break.  

So what do you do about other quick ways to unwind?

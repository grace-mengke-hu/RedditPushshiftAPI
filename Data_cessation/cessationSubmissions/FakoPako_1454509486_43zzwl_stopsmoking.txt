Big test coming up this weekend

Heyoooooooo! What's poppin' big pimpin' New Year non smokers?

Hope everyone is hanging in there! It's pretty easy now with 33 days smoke free huh? 

I have a big test coming up this friday. My friend and I are meeting up for little extravaganza. It will be just him and I, going to the shooting range, then hit the local Irish bar. Catch up, joke around, have some fun. He originally asked me if we should call our other friend, but I said I rather not because that other friend smokes. The friend that I will be hanging out with doesn't smoke, which is good. Regardless, it will be a huge test for me this weekend because I am going to have more than one drink lol

I feel safe. I don't think I should fear falling into smoking trap again. I strongly feel that I would not do it because I have too much riding on it. 33 days deep, all my friends know and congratulate me on how good I am doing, my work knows.. I would look like a freaking fool smoking again. 

One thing that helps me is, I go back to that horrible feeling that you have when you start smoking again after not smoking for a little bit. That guilt, that smell, the instant feeling of being tired and out of it. I don't want to have those feelings ever again.

So, with all that said, happy 2nd month peeps! How fucking awesome are we? huh? I say, pretty fucking awesome!

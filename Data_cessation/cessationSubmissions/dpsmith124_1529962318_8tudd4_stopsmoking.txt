So annoyed at my ridiculous thoughts!!

So I have made it to day 26.  Smoked 2 packs a day for 26 years.  First time I have ever tried to quit, so I am very happy with my progress.  All the usual cravings, thoughts, excuses, and so on have come along with quitting. Nothing special or different——Just like everybody else who has fought this battle has experienced.  Today, my brain is telling me that I should be a “monthly smoker.”  As a reward for not smoking, I get to have one cigarette a month!! So ridiculous. But I am actually trying to convince myself that this a valid and sane plan!!  I have to laugh because if not, I would go smoke!  Thanks for reading.  If anyone would like to share some of the ridiculous plans their brains came up with while quitting, I would love to hear.

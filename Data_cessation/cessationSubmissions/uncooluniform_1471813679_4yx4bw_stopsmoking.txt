Started smoking cigars after quitting cigs for 3 years

While I quit smoking cigarettes 3 years ago, I have recently developed a one a day black and mild habit. This has been going on for about two weeks now and I'm finding it difficult to quit. Anyone been in this situation before? Ugh so frustrating.

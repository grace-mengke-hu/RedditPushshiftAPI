Hey all I’m new here this is my first post

It’s not letting me share the screenshot from the smoke free app but I’m at 1 month and 3 days nicotine free!  I still get plenty of cravings and urges to smoke so finding this sub has been very helpful. I know I still have far to go but I’m proud of how far I’ve come and wanted to share my progress.

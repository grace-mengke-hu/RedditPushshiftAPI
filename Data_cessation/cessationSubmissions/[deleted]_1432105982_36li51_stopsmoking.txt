48 hours in, already fell off the wagon, fuck.

I'm 22, my height is 1.75 and I weigh 95 kg. I decided to calculate my BMI and I realised it was over 30, so I'm officially obese now. obviously it hit me like a truck because I knew I was overweight but I never actually thought that I was obese.

So I decided to work out, the problem is being obese and smoking a pack a day resulted in me almost passing out from exhaustion after 5 FUCKING MINUTES of somewhat mid-level cardio.

so I decided to quit smoking so I can work out. now I've been smoking for the past 2 years now and I never even tried to quit before, but as the title suggested I caved after 2 days

the main problem is that first cigarette felt like the first one I've ever smoked, with body tingles and everything

so how the fuck does one stop himself from smoking a cigarette while being well aware of the fact that smoking a cigarette after not smoking for some time is going to feel like crack cocaine

and also won't the dreaming of this "cocaine effect" multiply after not smoking for not 2 days but 2 weeks? 2 months?

how do you guys deal with this ?

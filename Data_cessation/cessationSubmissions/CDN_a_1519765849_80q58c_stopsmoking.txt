Almost 24 hours... and so far so good!

I'm not quite sure what has happened but I ran out of smokes last night... felt like crap and didn't go get any more. Have gone the day without.. feeling maybe slightly ill... but anyway decided.. hey might as well give this a try again! I pray I can stop...! I cough and hack and am choking every morning and it's disgusting. I cannot afford it either. I've smoked for over 45 years... Please God let me STOP NOW!

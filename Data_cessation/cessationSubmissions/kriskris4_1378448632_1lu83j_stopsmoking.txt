Just quit a couple of hours ago.

I have come to the conclusion that smoking cigarettes or vaporizers is another way of escape. When I'm feeling uncomfortable I smoke. Any negative emotions, smoke. Now I have to face my emotions. It will be hard but I am going to learn a lot about myself. These are only my opinions, please add or let me know what you think.

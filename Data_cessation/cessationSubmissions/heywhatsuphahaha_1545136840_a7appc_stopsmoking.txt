Scared to stop vaping

Right now I’m using 3 mg and have been for the past month or so.
Am scared that if I stop it I won’t be the same .... me.
With vaping I can puff whenever I’m feeling down or happy or whatever and I feel better instantly. It’s something to always lift me up with whatever I’m doing.
Should I just keep vaping and not even think about it till one day I stop by myself?
Will I be happier if I quit vaping? Or does nicotine actually make me stable and normal and happy?
I don’t know ...

It was a sign... Kind of funny

So it’s only day 3 today. 

The absolutely insane up and down emotions broke me down and I bought a pack. I wasn’t even “craving” at that moment so I don’t know why I did it. Anyway, I went to a quiet spot by the river to have one. Right when the lighter flame was a hair away from igniting the smoke, it slipped out of my hand and into the deep snow. Now... obviously it didn’t light again, nor did I have any other source of fire with me. I kind of laughed to myself and  took it as sign that I should carry onto day 4, smoke free!

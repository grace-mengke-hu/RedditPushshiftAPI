Had a little epiphany about cravings

I'm 80 days into my life as a non-smoker.
As usual I had my snack break around 2 PM.
I used to smoke after grabbing something to eat, it goes without saying.
Currently I have the leisure to work in a public library: I went downstairs and I saw students smoking in the yard.
I thought: "I could bum a cig."
And, truth be told, it would be super easy.
But I didn't elaborate on this junkie brain's jab.
I could, but I didn't.
Cravings don't get less intense, it's just us building up stamina.

E-cigarettes as an alternative?

My dad used to be a heavy smoker, like 2 packs a day since he was 13 until he turned 56. Since he turned 56 (about a month ago), he has been using e-cigarettes. He still smokes about 1.5 packs a week, but that is way less since he uses ecigs most of the time. He says that ecigs take care of most of his craving.

Are there any health risks to smoking ecigs? Does using ecigs exclusively, not what my dad is doing, count as "not smoking" for this subreddit?

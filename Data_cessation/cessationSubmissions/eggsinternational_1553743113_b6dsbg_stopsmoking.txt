Can someone give me a reason not to have this cigarette right now?

I was gunna write down good reasons and put them in my pack but I didn't and I can never think of them in the moment

I haven't smoked in awhile but my lighter's dead so I'm walking home to get a new one

I don't care about the long term effects, I'm only going to have one, and I'm convinced it will just be this one, why shouldn't I have this specific one?

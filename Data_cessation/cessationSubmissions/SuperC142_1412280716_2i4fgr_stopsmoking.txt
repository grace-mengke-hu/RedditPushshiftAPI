Four digits, today!

Today is my 1000th day and it truly does not seem like it was that long ago.  For those of you just starting out, I know it can seem hopeless sometimes, but I promise: you'll be here in no time and you won't believe how fast time has flown!  I was *crazy* addicted, too.  It's different for different people, but I won't lie; I was definitely not one of the ones that can say "it was only hard for the first two days, then I was home free".  I was miserable for a long time, but I *still* got past it.  Hang in there- if I can do it, you can too!

Edit: Thank you so much for the gold!!

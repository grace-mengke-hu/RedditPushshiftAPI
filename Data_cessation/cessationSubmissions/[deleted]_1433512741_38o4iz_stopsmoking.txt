7 days cold turkey

Just wanted to put this in writing somewhere. The first day was by far the hardest. I don't get cravings to smoke anymore, more of passing thoughts. I've been eating sunflower seeds, chewing on tooth picks, and squeezing a memory foam sample (like a stress ball). Not to jinx it or anything, but far easier than I had anticipated. Good luck to everyone here, and may our health keep improving.

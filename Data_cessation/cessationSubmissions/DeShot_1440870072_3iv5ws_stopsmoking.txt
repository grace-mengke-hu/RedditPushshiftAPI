Quit Smoking apps

Hi everyone,

23 year old male finally deciding it's time to quit being a slave to nicotine. I have been smoking roughly 7 years, anywhere from 10 cigs to 2 pack a day. This is not the first time I've quit but the last attempt, I wasn't prepared.

I was reaching day 60 when my phone decidea to die. I lost my smoking app along with all my days and min without a cigarette, which made it so much easier going back to smoking in my fucked up head. Not this time.

My question is if any of you have come across quit smoking apps for phone that create a backup of your quit day, etc. Also any opinions on which are best.

I look forward to joining many of you in become smoke free, and I hope to participate in this subreddit. Like I said, this is the last time I'm quitting  so taking all appropriate steps. Thank you all.

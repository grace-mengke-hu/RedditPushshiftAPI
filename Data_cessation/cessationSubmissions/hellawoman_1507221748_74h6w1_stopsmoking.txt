(NOT) accepting my slip up

Having to withdraw from a tennis tournament due to shoulder injury threw me to a spiraling week of chain-smoking, self-loathing, with some alcoholic binging in-between.

Had over 2 months under my belt and hadn't cogitated to smoke in quite some time.

With the mentality of being able to slip up then quickly after forgive yourself, people often just do so.
IMO it is not worth it.

Never quit quitting!

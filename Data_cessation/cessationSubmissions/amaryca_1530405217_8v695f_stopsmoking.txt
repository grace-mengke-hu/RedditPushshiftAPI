Trouble with urges while bored at work

I work in a craft beer bar for my second job. It is the only place I have serious urges. Alcohol, plus it is here that I get the most bored or annoyed. Doesn’t really matter if it is slow or busy, I still find some reason to want to smoke. I have told everyone I work with that I quit and they don’t tempt me. But just seeing them walk outside is temptation enough. I’m 14 days into this quit and I am determined to make it stick. I generally can quit for 3-9 months cold turkey and then one day I think “I can have one little cigarette and not be totally addicted.” Then two days later I’m back to a half a pack a day. Any tips to help would be great.

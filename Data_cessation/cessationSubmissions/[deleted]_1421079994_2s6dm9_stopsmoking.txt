Smoker for 10 years, three days smoke free.

I am nearly 25 years old and I have been smoking since I was 15. I am just done with it. The smell, the health issues, the shame. I have been hiding it - or trying to - the entire 10 years. 10 years of shame, 10 years of worry, 10 years of embarrassment. I'm just done. My trigger is driving - I have always smoked in the car because I refuse to smoke in front of or around anyone. Any tips on how to get through my 30 minute commutes to work and school? Thanks in advance.

Day One Here I Go!

I am getting older, 30 years old to be exact, and I want to have a baby. Have to be serious about this and I only want the best for my future unborn child. I lost the weight, 90lbs to be exact, and now its time to ditch the cigarettes too. Ive been a heavy smoker most of my life. I smoked my last cigarette today around 8:00 PM and I have no more. I WILL NOT BUY ANOTHER PACK. I am vowing to quit so that I can have a happy healthy baby! 
Gonna need this place for the support! 

EDIT: i signed up for a badge and its not working. so for myself so that I know April 4, 2016 at 8:00 P.M. CST is when i quit smoking! so if the badges do get fixed than Ill be able to input that!

I’m an addict in recovery

I’m 52 and have smoked for nearly 30 years. I’ve tried to quit many times, including a long run spurred by hypnosis. This time is different. My whole outlook is different. Previous attempts have been haphazard. This time, I’m getting wellness coaching through my health care provider. I’m taking Wellbutrin. And I think most important, I view myself as a person in recovery. That means daily caution and preparation for triggers. Truth is, at 52, if I don’t make it this time I may never be able to believe in myself again. I’m not a smoker. I’m an addict in recovery. Every day is a small triumph for an addict. 30 days or 6 months don’t mean shit. I’ll celebrate when I hit the 10-year mark.

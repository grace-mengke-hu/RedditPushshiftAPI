Going through a lot of changes for 2016

I used to work at a job that I hated, working countless hours for not nearly enough pay. I didn't have any kind of a social life, it was putting strains on my relationship, and I never had any energy. Not to mention that the stress of my job was bringing back my depression and anxiety.

So one day, when I was offered a job in a different field, I quit that job. Yes, I am still dealing with my depression and anxiety, but it is much more managed, since I actually have time now to go to see a medical professional.

When I was working that job, the stress of the job made it so that I felt like I had to smoke just to receive some sort of stress and anxiety relief. Unfortunately that has carried over into this chapter of my life. I know it's terrible for me, so I want to quit.

I recently started taking Wellbutrin to curb my cigarette cravings and it is working. Cigarettes just taste awful to me now. I have set in stone that, as of September 8, 2016, I will not smoke anymore. I have developed habits that help reduce my stress, and have medication that can help me when my stress or anxiety are too much. Now I just need to get the message out there (even if it is to strangers that I will likely never meet). I feel like this subreddit is just the support system I need. I'm going to start posting on here, hopefully success stories from myself and the right words of encouragement to others who may be struggling.

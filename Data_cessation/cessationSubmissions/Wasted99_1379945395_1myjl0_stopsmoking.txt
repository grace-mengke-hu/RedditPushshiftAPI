How do I get motivated again?

So..; quit smoking two times, for a few months each. All went well, but then I started again. Worst part to me was the 'failing' part. First people notice you don't smoke any more, give you compliments, then after a few motnhs they see you back sucking that tar dick. They make a comment and then I feel like a loser. Well yeah, I quit but started again. Guess no spine in my body. 
I'm just suffering from this fear of failure, so this is my excuse for not doing shit about it. Comments are more than welcome.

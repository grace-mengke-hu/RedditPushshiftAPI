Today's musings from Europe...day 5

1. Just because other people are smoking, you don't have to.
2. Those people probably (maybe) don't want to be smoking, and wish they were strong and happy like you are without.
3. Not smoking doesn't diminish things. Quite the opposite. That cup of coffee? It's wonderful as is - smelly cancer stick doesn't make it better. Fresh morning breeze on the balcony? Good as is.
4. In a few years from now, you are not going to be saying "I wish I hadn't quit smoking."
5. You have everything you need.
6. Your hair smells great.

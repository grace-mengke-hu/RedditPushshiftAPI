5 days in and need help

Hi all, I haven't been smoking since the 19th. I've had miserable two days after I quit but I managed to survive them without smoking. But last night, I dreamed of smoking. I was feeling guilty and pleased at the same time in my dream. And I've been wanting to smoke since I woke up.

A side of me is telling me that I'll quit anyway in the summer. I feel like I can still smoke 2 more months and then %100 quit. This is because I only think of smoking around others. I don't even think of smoking it when I'm alone. Since I don't go out too often, I think I should be fine.

Other side of me is feeling guilty because I'm doing something I shouldn't be doing. I love how my heart is beating normally. But it could be so much easier to quit if I just tried it after the finals and everything.

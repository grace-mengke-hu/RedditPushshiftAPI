Bringing in 2013, cigarette free.

Ok so I quit once before for over a year, but then fell off the wagon after breaking up with my ex-girlfriend. It's time to get it right this time and knock it on the head once and for all.
Sick and tired of waking up feeling horrible and I can't afford to keep up this disgusting addiction. 

Going to try and take up a few new hobbies to keep myself occupied during the pangs. 

Does anyone have advice with regards to biting my fingernails? Last time I pretty much bit my fingers off and I'd like to avoid doing that again haha. 

Wish me luck! Happy New Year.

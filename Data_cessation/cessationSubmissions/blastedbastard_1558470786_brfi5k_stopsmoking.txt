14 years smoking. I am done today.

I have "quit" probably 20 times or more over the last decade and a half. I have never smoked more than half a pack per day, but I am just sick of it. I have never really looked to getting support through the quitting process, so I think this sub might be a decent place to start. 

Triggers are stress (obviously) and drinking. I drink small amounts most days. I would like to have a beer or two after work without coupling it with smoking. 

Goal is to get through the worst of it asap! I know I can do this. I have done it before. "Staying quit" is where things tend to get tricky for me. 

I hope to help motivate others along the way! Here goes everything! Let's do this!

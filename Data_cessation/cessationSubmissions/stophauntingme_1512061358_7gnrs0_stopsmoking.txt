I had a fitness routine, got all these workout clothes &amp; even some new awesome trainers, but I hit day 30 &amp; my body+mind is like "fuck you, I don't wanna be healthy"

I was being so productive &amp; healthy up until a little over a week ago and now I don't feel good wearing these awesome gym clothes I got, I sure as shit don't want to work out or run in them, and honestly? I kinda want to just stay in bed, eat and drink a lot instead, but since Thanksgiving I've had some digestion issues so I'm kinda scared to do much of that (edit: I'm only 31 years old wtf lol) :/ 

This sucks. I read in another post (or maybe an article somewhere) that your nicotine receptors start disappearing after a month, so a dip in motivation/happiness can be expected. Is that legit? Seems like it could be legit...

Any help or recommendations?

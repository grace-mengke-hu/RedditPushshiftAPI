My first day going smoke free

Last night I threw the remaining cigarettes away that I had. I'm going to be busy all day (school then work) so hopefully that will keep my mind occupied.

This is my third real attempt at stopping smoking and I really want the third time to be a charm.

Going forward, I tend to want to smoke cigarettes the most when I am bored, thirsty, or stressed out. What do you guys do to prevent bored or stressed smoking?

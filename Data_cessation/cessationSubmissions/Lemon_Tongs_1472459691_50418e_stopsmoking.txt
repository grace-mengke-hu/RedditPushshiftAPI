3rd day of quitting, experiencing a strange metallic taste in my mouth.

So this is about the 5th attempt I've made this year at quitting and I think I've finally hit my stride, however something new and somewhat alarming has happened to me this time and the last time I attempted to quit. After only my second day of being off cigarettes I've had a strange metallic taste in my mouth that almost stings my tongue. I've read about other people getting this sensation but never this early in the process. Anyone know what this could be?

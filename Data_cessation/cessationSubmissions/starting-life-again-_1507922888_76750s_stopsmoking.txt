Butting Out Again

Hello Everyone, 

I am back once again albeit with a new account. It has now been just under a week since my last cigarette. I have just recently started Graduate School and I promised myself when I finished my undergraduate two years ago that I would not be a smoker next time I went back to school. Unfortunately, here I am back in school and only just butting out again. 

To give you a bit of background, I'm 24 years old. I started smoking on a daily basis when I was 15 years old. By 18 I was up to 20 a day usually and up to 30 when it was a particularly difficult day. This behaviour continued until I was 22. Four years of bad breath, yellow teeth, disapproving family and friends all to pay a lot of money for the privilege of dying early (yes I have read the Allen Carr book).

However, on September 12, 2015 I had what I thought would be my last cigarette. I read the Easy Way book and I was certain that this was going to be the thing that got me off the smokes. And it worked for a while. I quit right after reading, started drinking less, got a good job and started going to the gym. All was looking up until June of 2016. 

Unfortunately, smoking is not my only vice. I also drink too much and drinking was what set this all off. After a night drinking with some friends I had just one. I thought "It took me months to get addicted last time" and "it's only one, you'll be fine." Well both of those sentiments were wrong, very wrong. By the end of that summer I was back to where I was previously smoking 20 a day and have been there ever since. 

I now embark on that long road again. I've made passing attempts to quit but this time I am determined to do so again. My ordeal has taught me two things. First is that I can stop smoking. The second is that I can never go back not even for a puff. 

Have a good night everyone and thanks for reading.

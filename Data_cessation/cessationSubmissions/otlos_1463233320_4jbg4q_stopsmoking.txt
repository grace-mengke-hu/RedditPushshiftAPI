Giving up smoking & health anxiety

Hi all - been lurking on this subreddit for a while, has been really useful for helping me kick the habit. I haven't been smoking that long - about 4 years since I was 17, 1/4 of a pack for the first two years and then 1/2 to 1 pack a day for the last two - but I feel like if I don't quit now I could end up with 10 more years under my belt.

Whilst I feel really motivated to quit most of the time, I'm struggling a lot with remorse about the possible damage I've done. I am also doing my finals at the moment which probably isn't helping stress, but I keep getting into these spirals of thought where I feel like I've messed up my chances for a healthy life. So of course I jump to the irrational conclusion that I should just start smoking again - the logic being not just for the fix, but also so I can get back into the mindset of not caring too much about my health.

I quit back in January this year but I've had intermittent relapses and currently in one now. Sadly enough I do feel like, when I'm smoking, I have tunnel vision - I'm more interested in the next cigarette than I am about what my health may be like when I'm 30.

Has anyone got any advice on how to deal with this cycle?

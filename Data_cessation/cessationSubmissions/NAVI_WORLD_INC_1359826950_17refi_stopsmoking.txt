A little Confession and a Huge Success.

I haven't asked to have my badge reset yet, only after 10 days after I requested my badge to be generated. I started smoking again... This went on for over a year apparently. I just stayed away, I didn't post here as to not show off my badge of lies. So I apologize, and I hereby request my badge to be reset today.

But today I will announce a major success. The last smoke that I had was on January 7, 2013, which marks 26 days today. This is by far the longest I have ever gone and this time it is much easier for me. Day 2, 5,6, and 10 were  always the most difficult for me and I survived them. At this point in my quitting strategy I am pretty sure I am gonna be able to stay cigarette free for the rest of my life.

Anyway thanks /r/stopsmoking, your experiences, resources, knowledge and general comments have been encouraging and helpful to me.

What do you do to keep yourself busy?

My last cigarette after smoking for roughly 10 years was at 11 o'clock last night. I'm using patches because I don't think I could be successful without them. 

I'm just noticing that I'm occasionally thinking "oh, time to go outside" and then remembering I'm not doing that anymore. I have cleaned my house, went to visit a friend, watched a movie, cleaned some more. It's raining out or I might've went for a walk. 

I'm just feeling really anxious. I know I can do it, I know I don't want to fail. I've already told too many people as a way to make myself accountable but I gotta figure out how to not be so all over the place.

It's time

I haven't enjoyed a single cigarette this week. Not one of the probably 150. 

I'm missing the smoke free feelings I remember from past quits, and I've turned a corner in my mental health recently.

I put in my 2 weeks notice this week for the workplace I loved, but that kept me out at odd hours and didn't effectively use my skill set. I've already booked consulting work to fill the financial gap, so there's opportunity to set healthier habits as I make the transition. 

I'm not sure how successful I'll be, but I've got to put in an effort to cleanse and heal from this marinade of nicotine and tar. 

Thank you all for sharing as you do. I'll be stopping by to keep myself in check.

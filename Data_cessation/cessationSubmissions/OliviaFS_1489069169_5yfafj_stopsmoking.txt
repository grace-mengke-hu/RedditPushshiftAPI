Hey everyone. First time posting in here

I quit about 6 months ago. I started law school and been enjoying the " every now and then" cigarette knowing this is a slippery slope. Does anyone Have any advice for not going back to the full blown addiction? I'm pretty nervous I'm going back to a place I fought so hard to get out of. 

Thanks

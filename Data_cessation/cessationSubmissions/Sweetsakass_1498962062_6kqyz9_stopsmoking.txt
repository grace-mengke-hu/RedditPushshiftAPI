Laying awake again

So I quit smoking two and a half months ago using patches and zero nicotine vapes . All is good and I'm so proud of myself, I've been out drinking still no cigs which is a big yay because I've never been able to do that before. Anyway I'm on the last patch now the tiny 7mg nicotine and I'm not vaping because I can't breath well at the min plus for the last couple of days my sleeping has become a joke I'm getting like 3/4 hrs a night . Is this because of my quit ? And please tell me it's going to get better.

I’m feeling so frustrated...

No, I haven’t smoked. But here I am, nearly a year into this new life, and I’m still constantly tempted. I am so envious of those who say cigarette smoke disgusts them. To me it smells like heaven. Still! I don’t know whether I’m looking for advice or encouragement...it’s just so damn hard.

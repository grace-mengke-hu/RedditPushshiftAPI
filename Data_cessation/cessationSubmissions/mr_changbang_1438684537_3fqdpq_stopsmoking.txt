Please, I need advice on getting back in shape.

Hi, I'm still a smoker as of now and I'm quitting tonight. I'd like to ask this community for advice on how to nurse myself physically back to being athletic and sporty.

I used to be a long-distance runner, rower, sailor and I used to play basketball, all competitively - I did all of them quite often and I was pretty physically fit. After 2-3 years of 5-10 cigs a day (there were periods of months where I stopped) I'm starting to feel the toll. My endurance for all sport activities has decreased gradually and now I feel like an old man. I've stopped rowing, sailing and playing basketball, and I haven't run any long-distances without wheezing and feeling like crap for a week after. It's simply unacceptable to me.

I'm 19 years old, but I'd like to get back to doing what I love doing, being athletic and in full shape by six months (is that possible?) If it works out, I'd really like to be able to run marathons again and get back into competitive rowing. I'm tired of being ostracised all the time because I smoke by the rowing community, and I don't enjoy smoking anymore so what the heck, I'll quit now anyway. It's not difficult.

So probably what I'm asking y'all is, what is the quickest way to target the areas that have been damaged by smoking? Any former smokers who've made a full physical recovery, could you share any strength/cardio training plans that were crucial to undoing the damage caused by smoking? How can I repair my lungs and endurance? 

Please help a brother out, you guys are awesome at what you do, helping each other and it would be a huge favour if you could share some tips in this area.  

I really want to change my life, and being a skinny, lazy smoker was not what the 12-year old me envisioned I'd be when I am 19. Thanks!

I quit cigs almost 5 months ago and now I don't even want to puff my ecig

A friend pointed me to this subreddit this morning. I've never been more proud of myself, but haven't really shared this with anyone. I got married in July of this year. At my bachelor party in June, I vowed that would be my last weekend of smoking. I bought an ecig a week prior and started getting used to it, but still had some smokes. Well, I killed 2 packs that weekend of my favorite American Spirits, then called it quits.

I was vaping every day almost religiously. By October, I started forgetting my ecig at home a few times per week. At first I got pissed, but by the end of the month, I didn't need it anymore. This past weekend I vaped for the first time in nearly 2 weeks. It was nice, but weird. I haven't used it since Saturday. I'd like to think I finally kicked this smoking habit.

You could say I went cold turkey, but I had some help. I still had nicotine, but I wasn't lighting up the shit that I once "loved". I encourage everyone who is trying to quit to just believe in yourself and do it. Ecigs are a great way to assist, in my mind. Get a non-tobacco flavor of smoke juice. I found that to help even more.

Considering starting again after 200 days.

Hey guys, 

I quit smoking a little over half a pack per day cold turkey exactly 200 days ago today and with the exception of the first couple weeks (pretty rough) it's been okay. I had cravings every other day or so but was able to suppress them with little trouble. 

All that changed about a month or so ago. I was prescribed Adderall XR 20mg for attention problems and although it has made a huge positive difference in most aspects of my life, since I began taking it the cravings are off the charts. It feels almost as if it's day 7 all over again. I've held off for a really long time, but it is making me miserable and there's no end in sight. I don't want to be chewing on toothpicks for the rest of my life. Any advice? 

Thanks and sorry for the wall of text!

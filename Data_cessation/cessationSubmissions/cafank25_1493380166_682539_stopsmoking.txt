Permanent lung damage?

was really angry today - did one of my 'old' walks for the first time since quitting - and I was as puffed and puffing as much as ever . Really disappointed, but after so many years of smoking I am sure my aerobic capacity must be way below par. Swam a few lengths afterwards and they weren't so bad but I was soooo slow. Hopefully my breathing will improve some more over time.

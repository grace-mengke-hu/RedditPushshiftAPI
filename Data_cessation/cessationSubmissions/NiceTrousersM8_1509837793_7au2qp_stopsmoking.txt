A message for everyone in their first few days.

I just hit three weeks, and I remember using this subreddit every day for the first week or so. It really helped to be able to read about everyone's successes and see all the positivity. I remember seeing posts from people who were three weeks in, and thinking how impossible that seemed. Every day seemed to go on forever, the cravings were always in the back of my mind, I was existing hour by hour, and the idea of ever feeling normal again was so alien to me, I could barely comprehend it.

But here I am, three weeks without smoking. Barely any cravings at all any more. I'm regularly going all day without even thinking about it, and when I do it's no big deal at all. I just wanted to say that if you're reading this and you're just starting out, I promise that it'll go by faster than you think. You can totally do this, and before you know it you'll be weeks in, and you'll feel like yourself again and be so glad that you stayed strong.

And thank you to everyone here for part of being such an amazing community. I hope that this post will reach someone like all your posts reached me.

Help getting over the oral fixtation and problems with driving

I need some advice on the how to make driving easier for me, as I get the worst urges while driving. They don't go away either, as I used to chain smoke in the car. I'm on day two and feel like a super bitch even with the patch. How can I get over this? Also, would a disposable e-cig be something to consider for these moments? I'm trying to step off nicotine gradually.

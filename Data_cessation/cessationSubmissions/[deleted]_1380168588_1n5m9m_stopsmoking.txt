How do I come to accept that my father will probably die of smoking?

I've already accepted that his wife (stepmom) is partly to blame (not that I care about her anyways). She asked him to smoke after a month of having no cigarettes during a cruise. He's 54 and continues to smoke. His father got a lung cancer spot 40 years after quitting (quit in '64, discovered the spot in '04) and it was probably the cause of his after surgery heart attack in the 1980s.

Basically, when I bring it up to encourage him, he blows it off. I quit and I figured that would serve as some inspiration but apparently it has not.

My real mom is still puffing away as well. I don't know how to come to terms with it, but I predict he will be dead witihin 10 years and her within 12 or so. It's so pathetic. It makes me well up pretty bad. I feel lost.

I guess that I'm lucky to have quit at age 22. This subreddit has been very helpful to me (more so in the beginning weeks) but I am happy to keep posting here whether I need encouragement or others do.

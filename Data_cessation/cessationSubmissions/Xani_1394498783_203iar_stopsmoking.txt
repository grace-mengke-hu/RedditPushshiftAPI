Having a cold has never been so easy.

I'm nearly a year smoke free and I came down with a bastard of a cold this weekend.

Got a tickle in the back of my throat on friday, that developed into a full blown headache and constant sneezing/lethargy/sore throat for the rest of the weekend. It's now the small hours of tuesday morning where I am and all I am left with is a blocked nose. 

I can't remember the last time I powered through a cold quite so fast, but it's such a relief that I finally don't have to suffer two-week long illnesses because my body can't handle it all. 

Hooray for quitting smoking and the best of luck to each and every one of you. You have your health to look forward to now, it'll be glorious to celebrate it once again.

Selfdestrictive behaviour....

This is my second time around to try to quit...I find it extremely hard, as I have some selfdestructive tendencies...smoking was n beautiful socially exeptable way of self-destruction...my problem is I need a something to replace this...anything, hopefully something less self destructive ...please help...please don't say I need positive thoughts and try to reward myself rather than to be self destructive...I need something tangible...

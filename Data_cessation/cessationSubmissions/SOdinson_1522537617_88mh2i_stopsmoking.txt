4 weeks today

I was looking forward to today. It feels good to have made it this far after so many failed attempts. The other day I ran for the bus; it felt easy and when I got on and thanked the driver for waiting, I wasn't out of breath. The same day, after realizing I can do at least short sprints, I decided to run in order to make it through the crosswalk before the light changed. I can't remember the last time it felt so easy sprint and not be huffing and puffing when I was done. Things like this help me when an urge pops up. Taking a really deep breath and noticing how good it feels is an amazing tactic to remind yourself. Thanks to everyone in this channel, you have been a huge part of my success. To those that have slipped, don't use it as an excuse to slide. It's ok, addiction is hard, just keep it up and you will get there.

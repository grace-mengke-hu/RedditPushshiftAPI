Scheduled a Drs appointment just in case, but is this normal after 6 months? Feeling sick and coughing phlegm with a bit of blood.

Generally I've noticed I am way more fit, without putting too much work into it. 

But the past couple weeks I've gone from having a lot of phlegm in my chest that was very difficult to break up and spit out. The past couple days I've felt kind of down, almost flu like. And this morning I finally was able to produce something with a cough and well it was a decent quarter sized phlegm with blood mixed in. 

I scheduled a doctors appointment but I'm just curious is this just standard quit smoking stuff?

A little over 24 hours in thanks a few things

First of all, I would like to say thanks to those who responded to my first post, it really made a difference.

The second is the several large glasses of ice water i have been drinking.

The 3rd and most important has been my [old cat](http://imgur.com/a/7QKqn), Remy, he is 15 and my shadow.  He has been with me all day as I have done nothing but sleep and relax.

Also pictured there is a stack of 81 computer towers that I bought from a government auction website.  I am an IT girl that owns her own computer repair/sales business, and the price was right for them.  Should be getting them next week.

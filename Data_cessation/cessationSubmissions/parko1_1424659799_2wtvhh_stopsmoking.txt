How good is life without.......

I am now 37 days in and feel great. 
I no longer smell like an ashtray, my fingers are no longer yellow, my breath no longer stinks, my teeth are no longer being stained, my car no longer smells like cigarette, i can now be a proud father and to top it off i have heaps more money.
If you are considering giving up take it from me day by day it just gets better and better.
Oh and try reading easy way :)

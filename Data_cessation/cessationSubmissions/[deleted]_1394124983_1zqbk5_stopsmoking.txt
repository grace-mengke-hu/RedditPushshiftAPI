Try Three Day Two!

I quit about a year ago for three or so months, I quit in November for about a month.  Since November I only casually smoked (0-5 a day) but recently that number started to creep back up to 15-20. I stopped, randomly, cold turkey yesterday and am confident I can go another couple weeks.  My problem isn't the initial withdrawal but slipping up after three or four weeks.... any advice from anyone in a similar situation?

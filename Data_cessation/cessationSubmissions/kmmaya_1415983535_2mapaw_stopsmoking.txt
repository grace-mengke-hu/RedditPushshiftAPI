2 weeks strong after 11 years.... worried about tomorrow

I finally quit after 11 years of smoking and it's been 2 weeks. I feel great. Cravings  come but then they go. Taking it day by day. However, I am worried about tomorrow. Its a friend's 30th bday and we are doing a bar crawl that lasts from afternoon into the late hours of night. I've never not smoking when drinking. In fact it's not uncommon for me to have smoked a whole pack in just one night out. Any tips to not smoke? I have a vape that I don't use and was thinking of bringing that if I get super tempted? Should I not drink? Any tips are appreciated!

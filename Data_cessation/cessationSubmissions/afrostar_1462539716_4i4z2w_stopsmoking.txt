Bronchitis

I understand the why of it happening, but how common is getting bronchitis after quitting? I have it now, a little over two weeks after quitting. I'm not coughing a lot, but a chest x-ray showed thickening of the bronchial walls. I've had mild chest pains, as well. 

Anyone else go through this after a quit? I'm currently under a doctor's care, who is addressing the chest pains and such.

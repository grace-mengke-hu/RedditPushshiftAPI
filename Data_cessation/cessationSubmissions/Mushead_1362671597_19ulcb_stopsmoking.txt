Need some good advice to quit smoking ASAP..

I am smoking for almost 6 years ,with few non smoking weeks and that is all. Everytime I convince myself to start smoking again for some reason ,dont know what to do really. I work as a bartender and in this industry I noticed that 90% of people do smoke ,it might be random fact but it might be a reason that this industry is quite stressful and intense ,but on the other hand it might be another thought to make myself better about smoking..

Anyway ,I noticed that I get some health problems now ,sharp pain in the back of my lungs from time to time, even using stairs get me exhausted(I mean getting hard to breathe) and etc. Nothing really serious so far but dunno..I am 21 after all and my weight is normal (84kg).

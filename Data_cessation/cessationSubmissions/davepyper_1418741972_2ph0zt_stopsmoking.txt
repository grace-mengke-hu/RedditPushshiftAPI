I Quit, Quite By Accident

Friends at work showed me where to buy real electronic cigarettes with nicotine 'juice'. A few days passed with me quite enjoying my new purchase. About a week into using the new gadget, a friend offered me a cigarette, which I accepted and smoked. Except that it made me feel ill. And made me smell. And killed my sense of smell. When all of a sudden it occurred to me that I had managed to quit smoking. I still get my nicotine, but not the toxic soup of poisonous chemicals the labels on smokes warn you about. I'm happy, I can smell again and I don't smell bad, and I'm saving a fortune. What a surprise I had when I discovered that I had accidentally quit smoking. Yay me!

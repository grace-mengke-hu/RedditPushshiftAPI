Quitting tomorrow! Advice?

So, I've been smoking for about 13 years now. I feel gross just thinking about how long I've been a smoker, honestly, but there it is. 

I used to be extremely athletic. I'm still in good shape but I was a **runner**. I miss it so much, and I'm not old but I'm not getting any younger either. I would really like to be able to set these nasty things aside and move on. 

I guess one of the things I like most about smoking is being able to step outside with a cup of coffee and have five minutes of quiet, personal time. Basically, I stress smoke. I set my quit date for tomorrow about two weeks ago and have been trying to mentally prepare and cut back a little. I could use a little advise though - what worked best for you? What helps with intense cravings? Anything in particular to replace cigarettes with? Anything at all would be helpful!

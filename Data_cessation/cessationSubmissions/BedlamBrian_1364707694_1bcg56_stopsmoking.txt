Had half a cigarette burning at 11:59. Told myself last night I'd quit on Easter. I put said cigarette out at 12am, flushed the pack, and emptied out the pouch of rolling tobacco.

And I bet  I'm gonna be irritable as shit. It was a stress reliever for me since I was 18. I'm 25 now. It kills the appetite for me. I've lost muscle from not eating as much.

Fuck that shit. I'm done with it.

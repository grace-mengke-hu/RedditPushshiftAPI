I can't believe what I've been missing out on.

So, I'm just pushing my three week mark and I've come to a few realizations.

Every day for the last two years, I've taken the same walk.  It's about fifteen minutes, most of which is up a modest incline to the building where I attend classes.  I used to walk about half way and stop at one of the campus smoke pits for a "breather" (hah!)

Over the course of the last week or so, I've noticed two things:

1) I can *smell* that smoke pit from a football field away. I meet with friends who smoke and give them a hug and think to myself, "God, did I used to smell like that all the time?" -- Yup, sure did...

Not only that, but I can smell the perfume of girls as they pass by, the sweet scent of flowers along the trail and the smell of fresh-grilled food as I pass the cafeteria. Food tastes better, drinks taste sweeter and I suddenly realize that I probably should have been washing my bedsheets a little more frequently (oops!) 

I feel like I've opened up a sense which I had long sense forgotten.

2) During my daily walk, I find that I'm not out of breath at all.  I used to make that mid-way stop for a cigarette.  Really though, that was an excuse.  I wasn't craving a cigarette - I just needed a break after a short walk up a moderate hill. I used to arrive at class slightly out of breath, as if I'd just been jogging. Now I find myself walking faster than before without any wheezing and arriving calm, cool and collected!

TL/DR: *Ready for class, not smelling like ass*!

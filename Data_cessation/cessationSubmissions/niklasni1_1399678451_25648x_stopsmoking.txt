I want to shout! At everyone!

Everyone and everything is doing everything completely wrong at the wrong time in the wrong way. The flowers are the wrong colour and the music is the wrong pitch and my flatmate cooked the wrong food for us and the friend she brought over had the wrong accent and the TV show she watched afterwards was just wrong.

The stuff people are writing on my computer club's mailing list is so obviously wrong I don't even know why they bother. Reddit is bringing the wrong links to the front page and it's a good job that guy who blogged about that thing nobody cares about disabled comments otherwise I'd be up all night telling him in great detail how wrong the stuff he wrote about the wrong subject was. The temparature in here is wrong, this gum tastes wrong, and the clock is wrong because I should obviously be asleep at half one.

Day three is nearly over and nothing's good or nice or fine. But I know I've made the right decision.

(PS: I made up a name for this stage, post-nicotine syndrome, or PNS.)

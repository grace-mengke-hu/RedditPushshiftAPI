I've made it through my third work week

Well okay I still have to make it til 5 but I know I will. It's been a rollercoaster but I made it three full weeks of work!

I also started avoiding interactions with most people in my office because I hate them all and they make me want cigs ha ha ha. Don't care. Not smoking.

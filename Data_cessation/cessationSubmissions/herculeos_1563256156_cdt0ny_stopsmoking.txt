Attempt no 1183

It's happening today! This will be the one :D

I am not kidding, I really hope so. I want to stop hurting myself like this, and allow my lungs to regenerate.

Will also go running today. Exercising has helped me quit in the past, and I look forward to seeing my endurance improve as I keep training.

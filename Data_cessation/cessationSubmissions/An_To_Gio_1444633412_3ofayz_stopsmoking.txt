Another night, another dream

Last night I dreamt I was smoking with people from my teenager years.
I went inside and I was about to light up another one, when I thought: "Do you want to waste all you've been through so far?"
Perhaps we dream of smoking/relapsing because we are quitters and we think a lot about smoking, even though in a negative way, as in "I **don't** wanna smoke."

3rd day and i'm trying to rationalize

I sometimes make myself believe that there is some reason why I "must" have a cigarette. I've got seriously no reason for it, I've actually been feeling nauseous when I smoke, and I've had a surgery recently, but I feel my mind trying to find a fake reason to do it. It's so hard! I hate it.

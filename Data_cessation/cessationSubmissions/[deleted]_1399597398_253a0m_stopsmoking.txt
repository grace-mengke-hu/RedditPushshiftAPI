At the beginning of my journey. Support would be much apreciated

I'm trying again because I 100% want  to be smoke-free and I feel strong enough to get through this. It feels like the right time.

I have nearly 24 hours now. So far I haven't had a craving. I do have this nagging feeling like I'm forgetting something or something is missing (obviously, there is) but that's been the worst of it. 

I know it'll get worse before it gets better. I'm as prepared as I can be. 

Background: been smoking menthol almost 10 years, smoke half a pack a day and maybe once a week I'd smoke a pack. The last time I tried, about 3 years ago, I made it 5 months before I had the brilliant idea I'd become just a social smoker. Hahaha. I can imagine how many here have fallen for that.

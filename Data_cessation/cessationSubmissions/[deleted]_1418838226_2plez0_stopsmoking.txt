Niconergic Reactions and the Addict brain of a Wanna-Be Scientist

God Damn. My brain is a psychotic. I quit, just last week or whenever it was. The addict inside me has been whispering such fucking awful shit *your brain is not going to work as fast without nicotine*, *Nicotine aides in acetylcholine intake*, *what are you doing?* Such weird stuff your brain makes up to get you to take a drug it's like a child it's so silly! Thankfully, I have had many reasons to stop and remain a non-smoker, although I must say there are times where I catch myself agreeing with this fucked up mentality (Arguing with myself, makes me feel crazy, sometimes I think the only way to stop the argument is to start smoking again). Anyone else have these kind of thoughts? Please tell me I'm not as crazy as I feel....

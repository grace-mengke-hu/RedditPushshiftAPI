I'm really excited and optimistic right now

My emotions really are all over the place lol. Just a couple hours ago I hated everything and was incredibly pissed off but now I am super happy hahaha. 

I feel like this is a fresh start and putting all this shit behind me and finally moving on from the past 8 or so years. There's so much potential and a whole life ahead of me and so many things to do and I ain't gona waste anymore of it smoking. 

Some days I get really upset and feel like I've wasted 8 years smoking but right now I feel great putting those years behind me and moving the fuck on from being a smoker. 

I am just very happy right now and wanted to share something positive :D

WTF! Why is today so hard?!

So today has been rough.  13 days in and i am not sure i can do it.  Not an overly stressful day and not sure why i am feeling like this.  This group has been so great for me so far and am hoping for some words of encouragement or advice now!  Why, when the nicotine should be out of my system by now, am i feeling like climbing the damn walls today?!

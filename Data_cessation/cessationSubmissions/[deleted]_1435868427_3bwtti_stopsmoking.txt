I was attacked by temptation

This morning my cousin flew out to Europe. I was left with the task of looking after her pet turtle. As I was looking for the turtle food in her room, I opened a drawer and a pack of cigarettes stared at me in the face. It presented itself like it was from a commercial, with the top flipped and one stick dangling itself toward me. All it needed was a bright red ribbon stuck to it and a tag saying "Fuck your health, signed Nicotine."

I slammed it shut and had to sit down for a minute. After I stopped shaking, I promptly retrieved the pack and drenched it in the faucet. I'm thankful that I wasn't craving today, because that would have gone very differently.

I'm 40 days going and I feel better with each day. Don't let your guard down, folks. I believe in all of you.

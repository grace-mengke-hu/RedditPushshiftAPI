How is this done?!

So yesterday i decided to quit. 2 hours i was fine. 3 hours i was fine. 4 hours i was fine. 5 hours i was fine. 6 hours i was a bit edgy. 7 hours - crumbled, look everywhere in my house to find a bloody cigarette. It got so bad that i just couldn't and bought a pack.

I really need to and want to quit smoking. But it was so terrible, i couldn't think of anything but wanting a bloody cigarette. 

How the hell do you guys do it!?!

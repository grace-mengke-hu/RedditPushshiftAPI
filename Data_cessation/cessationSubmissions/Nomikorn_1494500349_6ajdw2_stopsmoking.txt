Quitting cigarettes with weed

First of all, sorry for bad english.

Im 24 years old and im quitting cigs tommorow. I have been smoking for 9 years and im smoking 25 cigs day. Im thinking about getting some weed for first days to help me with nicotine withdrawal symptons and to help me get sleep at nights. Im smoking raw weed only so im not consuming any tobacco while smoking.

Whats your thoughts about this? Have any of you tried quitting cigs with weed? How did it go? Any thoughts/experience will be appreciated.

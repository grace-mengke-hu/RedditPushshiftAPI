Plateauing

It's not like I'm about to smoke or anything, but after almost three weeks of constant, steep improvements, these past three days have felt like a bit of a setback. I was getting one craving a day - if any - and now I'm getting four or five. I don't think I've actually been close to smoking, but I feel a bit weary, like all the effort I've been making is getting to me.

It's silly but it was all going so well that I didn't expect this to happen! Any advice?

22 days in - lightheaded, dizzy...anyone else?

Was just wondering if anyone else has experienced what seems to be prolonged withdrawal symptoms. I feel lightheaded and slightly dizzy most of the time (comes and goes in waves). This can sometimes be accompanied by some nausea. Seems like most symptoms are not supposed to last this long...

Couple Quitting

Hi all, I have been following this subreddit for a few weeks now and have found it super helpful now that my husband and I are (I think) finally ready to quit.  This is what I will call our first serious attempt, although we have talked about it for several years and this summer we did cut down drastically.  I read Allen Carr's book (suggested here) and found myself about ready to quit, but I gave in after less than a day knowing the cigs were still in the house.  My husband finally got a new prescription for Chantix, which has worked well for him before in terms of cutting down severely (2 cigs a day), he just stopped too soon.  I have also been reading him Allen Carr's book which I think is helping.  He has always been one of those smokers who is sure he enjoys smoking, the taste, the burning, and that if he quits he will never stop wanting another smoke, but the books are helping with the psychological aspects I hope.

So our quit date is 1 week out now.

Together we smoke about a pack a day, I have been smoking for about 10 years and he has been smoking about 10 years longer than that. I worry that the biggest threat to our success is having both of us going through the withdrawals at the same time, that it will cause us to argue and the stress will cause us to smoke.  Quitting at different times seems just as hard because it is too easy to give into a passing craving if the pack of cigarettes is right there.

So I guess my question is has anyone ever tried to quit at the same time as their SO before and how did it work out?  Any tips for supporting each other without driving each other crazy?

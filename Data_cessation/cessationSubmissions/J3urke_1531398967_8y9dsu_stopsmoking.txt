900 days later; reflecting on my thoughts at 22 days

\[Here is a post\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/42frx2/22\_days\_in\_and\_no\_signs\_of\_slowing/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/42frx2/22_days_in_and_no_signs_of_slowing/)) I made at 22 days into quitting. 

I am proud to report that I still have not touched a cigarette since that day. Unfortunately shortly after posting my friends began justifying an occasional cigar, which turned into daily cigarillos, which turned back into cigarettes. I find it sad that they gave up what I have now for the temporary pleasure of those first few cigars. 

Prior to quitting, I was very doubtful that it was possible for me. I was sure that smoking would kill me. I urge anyone reading this who is struggling with quitting to listen to Allen Carr, and convince your remaining smoking friends to try stopping temporarily, or at least to refuse you any of their smokes. 

Please feel free to message me to discuss your quitting if you have any questions or just want to talk things through with someone. I have a genuine interest in seeing others quit as well. 

Trust me when I say that there is nothing more rewarding than no longer being beholden to nicotine after years of being in its grips.

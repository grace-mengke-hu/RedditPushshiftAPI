need something to turn me off the desire of cig

10 months cigs free, so im not in the addicted phase, neither think about them all my day or anything.

its just lately I been developing desire to buy a pack, especially after drinking

I dont want to smoke again, cause its so shitty for health, and Im young. already feeling some cardivascular effects.

anyone know how to stop the desire.. Im afraid I'll break my nicotine sobriety if I keep the same mindset

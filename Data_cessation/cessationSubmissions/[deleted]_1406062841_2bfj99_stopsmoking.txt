Can't concentrate. This is bad news.

I've been off the cigarettes for a week and I've found it surprisingly easy in terms of cravings. However, I've read that inability to concentrate in a side-effect of quitting smoking, and I'm really feeling this right now.
I'm 2 weeks away from sitting important exams so this is something with potentially devastating consequences. I know it wouldn't be right for me to start smoking again for this reason, but I can't help but think I may have chosen the wrong time to give up.
Can anyone help me out here?

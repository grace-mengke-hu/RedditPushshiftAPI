First Post. I'm here to reset my badge.

I didn't realize before trying to quit the triumvirate of cigarettes, alcohol, and marijuana just how much incredibly severe depression they were covering up. I caved after 3 days because I couldn't handle the abject sadness that settled in. I don't know if I can do this and it makes me so very scared. Just needed to express that here, anonymously.

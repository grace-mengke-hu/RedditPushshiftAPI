It's been four days.

As expected, my mom didn't last one. But I held strong and four days later, I'm still cig free. 

I keep waiting for my lungs to clear or for me to feel better or my joints to stop hurting but I have to remember that my medical issues weren't caused by smoking, just worsened. 

I'm supposed to be proud of myself.... right?

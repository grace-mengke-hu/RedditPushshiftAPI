4 weeks today! I feel amazing.

4 weeks ago I was smoking between 5 and 15 smokes a day. Feeling like shit, tired, and always thinking I had cancer every time I got sick. I have lurked this subreddit for a long time and also /r/GetMotivated, and after all the browsing I guess something just clicked and I decided to quit cold turkey and start lifting at the gym 3 times a week. I feel so good. My muscles are stronger, I can run further, my skin is clearer and my self esteem is through the roof. I guess I just wanted to share with you guys, because I don't think I would have gained the courage and strength to do this without reading all of your stories. I also think eating healthy and going to the gym have helped immensely with cravings and given me something positive to focus on.   Anyways, thanks again r/stopsmoking! You guys are awesome.

Smoke free APP encourages smoking?

So here I am, humming along on my quit and thought I'd do a mission from my app... Mission -4 Pick a new brand of cigerettes and smoke those until your quit date.

It says the missions are for after your quit day.. Even the quitting smoking apps are against us, stay strong!

(seriously though, wtf).

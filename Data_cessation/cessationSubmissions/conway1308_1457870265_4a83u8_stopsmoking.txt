2 weeks, smoking dream

Hello all!

Two weeks strong, 1 day without any NRT. I had a dream last night that I went out and bought a pack and smoked.  I woke up horrified, and ashamed laying next to my girlfriend who would be disappointed. I couldn't remember when I woke up if it was a dream or a memory.  I didn't stink, my mouth felt clean, I could smell and breath with no problems.

It was a dream I know, but I really wasn't sure when I woke up. My brain is trying to cope with this loss of smoking, like my habit is being starved and is in it's final throes. It's a great feeling to not smoke today.  Oh, and I don't like to say I'm quit.  It has a negative connotation I don't care for. I'm just a non smoker.

Good luck all.

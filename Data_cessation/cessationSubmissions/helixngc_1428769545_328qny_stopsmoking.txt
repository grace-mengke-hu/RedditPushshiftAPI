Day 10...The struggle is real but I'm feeling good!

I smoked for 13 years (since I was 18) almost a pack a day and although I have a lot going for me, it was like my entire life revolved around cigarettes. Not only when and where I could smoke but who I spent time with, where I spent time and the men I dated (all smokers obviously). I started when my parents got divorced and it was like a fuck you to them cuz they were very against smoking but subsequently became the only way I knew how to cope. As the years went on it only got worse and i noticed myself drinking more just so it would be pleasurable to smoke...so stupid! Also I started realizing it made me feel and look like shit and was making me so anxious I could barely stand it. I would go smoke a cig at work and realize afterwards that my heart was racing, my chest felt tight and i felt more anxious than when i went out!! This is my first quit ( i was waaaaaaaaay to scared before reading Allen Carr because smoking was like the love of my life)....but so far so good. Ive been taking it really seriously and doing everything possible to stay on track. I gave up coffee, started working out more, went to acupuncture and reiki healing. Hell i even went to a hypnotherapist! I will say that the most helpful thing so far other than the Allen Carr book is reading these posts and being on this board so thanks so much!! I'm still craving and thinking and dreaming about smoking a lot...i keep having vivid fantasies of smoking my old brand parliament lights which i gave up years ago for american spirits (the less toxic one lol AS IF) but its more in a distant way, not a 'im gonna buy a pack way'. I'm scared about going to europe this summer because smoking is so ubiquitous there but otherwise i'm feeling strong. THANK YOU GUYS SO MUCH FOR ALL THE HELP!

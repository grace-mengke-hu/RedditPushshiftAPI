Let's try this again.

I've been smoking for 4.5 years. I've been up to about a pack a day. I tried multiple times to quit, mostly by weaning. It hasn't been working. I've been dealing with some personal trauma and my smoking has increased since then.

I finished a pack on the way home from a rehearsal and decided to try going at least a day before buying my next pack. It's been just over 3 hours and I'm going a little crazy. I just need advice, tips, or help knowing that it will get better.

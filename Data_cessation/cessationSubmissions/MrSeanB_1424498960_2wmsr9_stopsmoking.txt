Recently caught mild bronchitis, caused me to stop.

So as the title says i recently caught a mild form of bronchitis, my doctor says its causing asthma like symptoms too, now i used to smoke between 15-20 a day, started with normal cigarettes and moved to rollies and tobacco, been smoking around 3 years and never thought id quit but i think this illness could actually help me pack it in!

i haven't had a ciggy for about 2 and a half days now, i just keep saying to myself im not going to have one when i am better, anyone else find themselves having dreams of smoking? haha i had my first one yesterday it was a bit of a nightmare cause i almost gave in, luckily i woke up!

Anyway just a small post telling a bit of my story, would love to hear some other stories, plus any advice you guys could give me on how to kick the habit for good would be great! 

Thanks!

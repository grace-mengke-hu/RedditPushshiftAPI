Today is my first day off the smokes.

I wanted to put it down in writing on here that I'm done with them. I feel better saying it out loud. 

I promised myself and my GF that when we buy a house, I'll bin them. Today our offer was accepted on a lovely 3 bedroom house in the 'burbs and I'm gonna follow through with my promise. I don't want to be a smoker. I never did. I thought I did.

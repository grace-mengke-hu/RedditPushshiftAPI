trying to quit and manage anxiety.

I've lurked here for a long time and just now signed up for an account to post what I'm feeling. any comments/suggestions/encouragements welcome.

I suffer from anxiety. I also smoke. I generally smoke about a 1/2 pack a day. Sometimes less, sometimes more. It's funny, my family doesn't know I smoke and so for the 7 days I was with them at Christmas I didn't smoke once. I should have just kept going right? Right. not that easy. Anyway, I've read Alan Carrs EasyWay this past week. It makes a lot of sense. I really like his approach and what he has to say but I haven't quit. Here's the thing: I know he's right. I believe the words I'm reading, but it's like my mind just doesn't want to believe it. 

So, right now I've bought and thrown away 3 packs today. This causes me more anxiety. Smoking causes me anxiety. Maybe I just need to keep reading and praying that something will click. I just don't want to wait until it's too late.

Edit: Thanks for all of the responses. Just a quick google search on "anxiety and quitting smoking" pulls up TONS of scientific research proving what I think we all know in the back of our minds: smoking actually makes anxiety WORSE and people who quit find that their mental health improves a lot over time. It also shows that, unsurprisingly, anxiety tends to make it that much harder for people to quit. So, I think I'm going to start tomorrow, knowing that in the end it will be SO much better, even if it absolutely sucks for a short time. I read something (maybe in EasyWay?) that basically said the short amount of suffering withdrawals is nothing compared to suffering cancer or any other life-threatening illness. the time is now!

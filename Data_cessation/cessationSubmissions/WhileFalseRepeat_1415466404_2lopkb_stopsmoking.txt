101 days and counting...

There was a time that going one day without smoking was unthinkable for me. I definitely wouldn't have made it to 101 without this sub. In the beginning of my quit I practically lived here and my ability to connect with others going through that hell was invaluable. The sharing of wisdom, support, and outside resources was incredibly helpful and simply being able to commiserate, rage, or share obstacles was cathartic. While I haven't posted lately, I still lurk sometimes so I just wanted to say thanks to everyone and keep on keeping on!

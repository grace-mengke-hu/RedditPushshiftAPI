Smoking may be a gift to yourself now, but quitting is a gift for later

Im 1.5 years into quitting (smoked 25 years) and not once have I regretted quitting. However, each cigarette you smoke will be regretted. 
I can honestly say that quitting has relieved me of so much burden: how i feel about myself, not worrying about how i smell, not timing activities so ill have a smoke break, not having to ask whoever im in a car with to make a pitstop for cigs, not having to hide from family and friends who will be judgey, not alternating from feining to feeling nautious, not having to get out of bed in the middle of the night to smoke...
What made me quit was suddenly no matter how much i smoked i still craved a cigarette. Sort of like my body was asking for the nicotine but couldnt absorb it. Because of that i figured i might as well quit if i wasnt getting relief from smoking anymore.

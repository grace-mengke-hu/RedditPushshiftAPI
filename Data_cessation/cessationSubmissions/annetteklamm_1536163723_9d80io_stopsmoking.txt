39 years of smoking

I’m only 12 days smoke free and it’s still hard for me to see myself as a non smoker but this is the longest I’ve gone without a cigarette!!! My husband still smokes but he has set his quit date for Monday. We always go outside to smoke so it’s really hard for me to go outside because I associate that with smoking. When do you quit thinking about cigarettes all the time?

Today's the day!

My father told me back when he first found out I had started smoking at 18, "If you're going to smoke, start and quit while you're young." Normally I can't stand my father but this is one of a few pieces of advice that stuck with me.

Fast forward to 25 (now), started noticing a cough that never really went away, and phlegmmy shit in my throat all the time, especially when I was laying down in bed. Quickly realized that 7 years of constant smoking was to blame, and that I needed to stop NOW before things really got out of hand. I read Allen Carr's book which has really helped me to put into perspective the excuses I used to keep smoking over the years. I think the final catalyst was looking at the full ash tray in the garage (10-12" in diameter and fairly deep) and realizing, regardless of how long it's been since I emptied it out, most of the material that was attached to those butts *is now in my lungs.*

Smoked my last cigarette this morning at about 8am after ~9-10 hours since the last one (as a rule I never smoked at work. 3rd shifter.) For the first time in years I felt worse after smoking a cigarette than before I lit it, which was actually wonderful, knowing that I'm starting to get into the right mindset. I have a great confidence this will be the last time I quit, especially after finding this subreddit for support.

Anyway. Thanks for reading, cheers, and happy rest of your Back to the Future Day!

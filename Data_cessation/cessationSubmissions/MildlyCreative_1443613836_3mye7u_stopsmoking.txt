Inspired by this subreddit, I'm giving it my all. Here we go.

About two weeks ago, I found this subreddit and did what someone suggested: subscribed and put it on my front page.

I kept seeing the posts pop up. I read about the apps that calculate how much money you've saved so far, how many cigarettes you haven't smoked, etc. I installed one on my phone.

I just entered the day and time of my last cigarette. I want this. I've known for quite some time that smoking stands between me and so many things I want in my life, so many things I want to do, accomplish, and have. 

I will be checking in as I move forward to offer and receive encouragement.

I wish you all the best. I wish me all the best, too.

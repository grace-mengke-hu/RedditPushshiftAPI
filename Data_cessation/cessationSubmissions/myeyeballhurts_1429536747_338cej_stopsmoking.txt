3 weeks today!!! I cant believe I have made it!

I feel great, I swear I am the only freak out there that has lost 7lbs since quitting. 

My husband hasnt made it, he will do fine during the week sucking on lozenges but he has to buy a pack on the weekends. I have not even been tempted, dont want any at all. 

We used to have our garage converted into our little smoking room, had a couch and old stereo out there, well this weekend we decided to re-claim the garage for actually parking a car inside it. Its kinda weird, lol.

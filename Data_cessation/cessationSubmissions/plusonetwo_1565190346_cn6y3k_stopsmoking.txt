Two years / 730 days smoke free

 Wanted to drop in and encourage those who have recently stopped or thought about stopping that you can do it.

It’s felt longer than 2 years since quitting, to be honest. I can’t say I never think about smoking sometimes but it’s gotten less frequent over this time.

Keep going!

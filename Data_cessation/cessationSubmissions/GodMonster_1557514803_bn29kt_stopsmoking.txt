Just starting out, should I step down to the 7mg nicotine patch or go another two weeks on 14mg?

After many attempts to quit cold turkey that lasted a few weeks at best and drastically affected my mood I've decided to go the patch route. I'm about 10 days into using the 14mg patch and have found that they alleviate my cravings about 90% of the time. I still find myself wanting a cigarette every few days but it's not a physical craving so much as searching for old routines. I plan on picking up another pack of the patches and will probably go at least another 2 weeks before I wean myself off of them, but wondering if I should step down to the 7mg now and keep a few of the 14mg on hand in case the 7mg don't alleviate the cravings at all? Either way I plan on stepping down to the 7mg before I quit altogether, but I'm wondering if it's worth staying on the 14mg at least until I've broken myself of the social and habitual desire to smoke before addressing the chemical addiction.

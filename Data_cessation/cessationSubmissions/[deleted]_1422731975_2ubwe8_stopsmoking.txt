I'm really unhappy and it's making it hard

I don't know what is wrong with me right now but I am just really upset for no reason. I know a cigarette won't help but it will fix it for five minutes.

I won't smoke but man do I want to. So instead I'm sitting here posting to stopsmoking eating flamers and feeling sorry for myself ha ha ha. Shit

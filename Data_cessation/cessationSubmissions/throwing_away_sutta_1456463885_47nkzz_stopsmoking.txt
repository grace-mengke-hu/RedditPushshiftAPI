Fucked up, Slipped around week 3

Last friday, on my 19th day of the quit, I got shit drunk. Went out with a friend who wanted to smoke to keep him company, didn't smoke. After a while, we went out again, and I fucked up my quit and had 2 drags from his cig. 

Should I reset my counter ? I don't even get any cravings these days, and I feel that slip might have helped too since those 2 drags didn't feel good at all in the chest.

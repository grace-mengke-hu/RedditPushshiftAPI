300 days :)

I am free for 300 days. 

It can be done, even when you have anxiety and do not know yet how to handle it and used to handle it by smoking. I am now in therapy and hope to learn good coping mechanisms and become able to beat this. Smoking was not helping me, it just was hiding the underlying issues. 

Here's to all of you :)

Social smoker here, decided to quit.. Advice please?

Hello people, as you can tell i have chosen to give up today. I'm 18 and on average i'd smoke around 20 cigarettes a week or so for nearly 2years, but all i did was smoke Friday and Saturday as that is when i socialise and drink alcohol. I really enjoy going outside for a smoke and socialising, always seems easier than when your in a pub or club.

I really don't want to stop personally but i can feel it taking a toll on my health and feel it's time. Anyone got any advice any other social smokers on how you dealt with it? One way would be to stop drinking but i enjoy a nice drink after work. I don't know.. Thanks for your replies guys

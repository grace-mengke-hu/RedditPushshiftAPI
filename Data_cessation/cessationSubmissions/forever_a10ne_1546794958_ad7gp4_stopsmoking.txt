It’s nothing crazy, but I wanted to share

I used to smoke a cigar once in a blue moon for a long time without any other interest in nicotine aside from that. This changed when my boyfriend introduced me to the Juul. It hit hard and quick, and there was none of the dangers of inhaling the smoke of a tobacco leaf. It was just nicotine. The 30 second intense head rush was fun and definitely provided a unique buzz.

I used to hit it when I’d drink. Then I’d hit it when watching browsing my PC. Then I started buying my own Juul pods for us to share. Then I started sneaking it into work to hit during my breaks and at my desk when nobody was looking. Then I would only get a buzz the very first time I’d hit it in the morning. Then I didn’t get a buzz anymore. Then I started to crave it when I didn’t have access... Then I knew I needed to stop. I really crept up on me, and it didn’t take long to get ensnared by the claws of addiction. 

I dropped tons of money on Juul pods that I could have been using for anything else. $17+ a week adds up over a year. It’s been tough, but I’ve been 20 days nicotine-free and I’m not looking back. No cigars, no vapes, no Juul. Just not worth it. I was no “two packs a day since I was 18” smoker, but vaping can be just as addicting and I’m glad to be over it.

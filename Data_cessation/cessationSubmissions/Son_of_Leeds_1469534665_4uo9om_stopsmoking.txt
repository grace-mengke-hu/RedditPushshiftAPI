How I've Been Conquering My Cravings...

As of right now, I have gone 15 days, 16 hours, and 47 minutes without a single puff of a cigarette or any tobacco/nicotine to speak of. Also, as of about 13 days ago, my cravings have been incredibly easy to manage. Here's how I'm handling it; hopefully some of my fellow recent quitters will find this useful.

So on day 2-3 of quitting, I noticed two things: I was INCREDIBLY anxious and unbearable, and I had an incredible amount of energy that I didn't have while smoking. My first thought was that the anxiety came from not having cigarettes to calm me down. Trying to rationalize this made my anxiety and cravings worse. Then, I remembered that you're supposed to experience a boost in energy levels after quitting. That's what gave me an idea: what if I just exercised to get rid of this new energy?

I started running on my elliptical (after dusting it off, as I hadn't been using it nearly enough while I was smoking). I picked up some dumbbells and started lifting a little. I even went outside for a (pretty slow) run every day. I noticed that working out was not only FAR easier after quitting, but it was a great way to burn off the extra energy that caused cravings.

Even if you're the type of person who never worked out while you were a smoker, you might find it an enjoyable, healthy way to stave off your cravings while helping your overall health. I went from smoking a pack and a half a day on the couch to running a mile and a half a day, and I know you can too.

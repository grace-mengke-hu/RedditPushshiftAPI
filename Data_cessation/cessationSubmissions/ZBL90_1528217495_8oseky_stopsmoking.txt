Day 1 Smoke Free-help!

I'm trying the patch. So far I think it's helped much more than if I wasn't using some sort of aid to help me quit. I just finished eating and I'm losing my mind here. I feel like I'm going to give in and I don't want to. Please help with more useful strategies than "keep your hands busy" or "get active" I've been doing these things and the craving isn't going away. Please help. Really need some words of encouragement here

Low blood sugar - dizzy and foggy

Hi guys,

I've quit cigarettes 18 days ago and still have some massive problems with brain fog and dizziness during the day. I noticed that when I get the brain fog and I eat some glucose it will be better within the next 30 min. So my question is how long will this last until my body readjusted to self-control the blood sugar?

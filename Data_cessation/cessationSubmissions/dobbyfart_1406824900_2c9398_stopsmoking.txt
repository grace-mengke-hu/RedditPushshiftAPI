TWO MONTHS

Hey /r/stopsmoking! It's been two months since I quit smoking! I literally can't remember the last time it felt so great to not smoke. I never really believed I had quit all the other times I quit, but this time I believe it. I am a non-smoker! There are still days when I have a craving, but I handle them so much better. I'm a lot more active now that I'm not worrying about how I can cram in cigarettes and an exercise during my lunch break, and I eat a lot better now that I can actually taste stuff!

Thanks to everyone on this sub. Sometimes all I did was upvote, but it felt great to read your stories, your milestones and your questions. It made me feel much less alone. Have a great Thursday!

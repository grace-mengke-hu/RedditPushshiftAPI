Holy #@&!

So, day 10 today. Been fine up until now. Was on leave for a week, minimal cravings. Now I'm back at work, and holy crap, I'm struggling. 

As background, I'm training as a surgeon and have been smoking since I was an  undergraduate. Literally my whole proffesional career has involved smoking. So many conditioned responses, I'm taking a bit of strain.

Just need to vent I guess. Thanks for all the support from this sub. Keep on keeping on people!

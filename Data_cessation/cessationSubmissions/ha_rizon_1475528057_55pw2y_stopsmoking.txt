From cigs to E-cigs to nothing. No cravings, but reflexes. Annoying...

Hi. I have been taking in nicotine for the last 6 years now. Started with cigarettes Around 2012 I got into electronic cigarettes and have not looked back since.

Now well, sometimes a boy meets a girl, and that girl inspired me to stop with the nicotine altogether. So I reduced my intake by cutting the juice down from 6 mg to 3, down to 1,5, down to 0.75. Every step along the way lasted around 2-3 weeks. Now I took a chance when visiting my girlfriend for a week and did not take any kind of nicotine delivery with me. 

This went well. I had some thoughts about vaping, but I would forget about it immediately. I have arrived home again and now that I am back in my usual surroundings it does happen that "nicotine reflexes" kick in. I am being adamant about it - I have no cravings, but there are times where I would usually grab my box mod and taking a deep inhale. Which I am not, because I put the cigarettes somewhere I cannot reach them. Now. This is not painful, just very annoying. Especially when playing video games I would usually take some vapes when I died, this helped reduce stress and somewhat became a ritual - which is just annoying me at this point. On the other hand I am very proud that I am not sweating and shivering like the last time I tried to quit straigt from 3 mg.

What is the best way to deal with nicotine reflexes?

Much thanks, any help appreciated.

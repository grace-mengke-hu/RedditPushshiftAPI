Day 15

So day 15, and the cravings are completely gone finally. I didn't realize that after the first 3-4 days it wouldn't be hard at all. I'm breathing better, sleeping better, hell everything tastes and smells better. It's totally worth sticking to it. Also, going cold turkey was the only way that EVER worked.

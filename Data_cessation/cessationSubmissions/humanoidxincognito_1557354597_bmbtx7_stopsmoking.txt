relapse after 7 years

I quit for seven years but I recently relapsed. I smoked three or four cigarettes every day for two weeks. I'm now on day three without smoking and I can't believe that it feels like I'm back at square one. I really never thought I would be having these cravings again, especially after a relatively mild (compared to my pack a day habit from back in the day) relapse.

Exercise as a way to combat cravings

I just finished a 1 mile run after going 24 hours without a cigarette. My heart is nearly beating out of my chest and my lungs are on fire but it really helped me with resisting the urge. I'd definitely recommend it for anyone out there struggling with cravings. I think the discomfort helps you to realize how much damage you're doing to your body by smoking.

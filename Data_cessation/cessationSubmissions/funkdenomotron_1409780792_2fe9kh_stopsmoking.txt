Funk checking in. Near the end of day 5 and all is well.

Thought I'd do some periodic check ins while turbo thrusting tobacco in its puny little face. 



I'll just be honest, this is just not as hard as I thought it would be. The patch is my friend.  Sure the first day was kinda Basketball Diaries, and I ate like 23 sloppy joes. I had some beers on day 2, and didn't even really notice the cravings. 



Day 5 and all is well. I got a haircut, and tried some new cologne, which I can still smell. I can also still smell the sardines that girl had for lunch at work. (WHO BRINGS SARDINES TO WORK FOR LUNCH???!!!)



I keep expecting to get this overwhelming torrent of cravings and awfulness, but it hasn't come. I just feel better and LOOK better everyday. Still wearing the 14mg patch. 



There it is, day 5, collect underpants. Day 6? Day 7 - profit.

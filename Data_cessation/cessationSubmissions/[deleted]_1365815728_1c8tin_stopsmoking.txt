Moment of revelation?

Finished Allen Carr's book, which is fucking great, by the way. Day four cold turkey. I stopped by the dollar theater after work-- watched a three hour movie without even thinking about smoking (movie theaters used to kill me.) When I stepped outside, I felt a sense of utter bliss and freedom. Don't think I could have done it without Mr. Carr, or at least couldn't have been this happy. I'm sure there will be some tough times, but it feels great to be a ex-smoker!

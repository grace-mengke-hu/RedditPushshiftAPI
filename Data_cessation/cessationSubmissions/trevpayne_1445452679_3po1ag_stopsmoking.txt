Quitting quitting.

I have been "trying" to quit for years. I have set dates that blew by while I puffed away. On Sunday October 18th I lit a smoke at 11:35 am. It was the last smoke in my pack. I had not planned this. When I finished that smoke I told myself I am no longer a smoker and I haven't had one since. 
The reason I have quit quitting is because as of the end of that cigarette I am no longer a smoker. I have nothing to quit. I am not a smoker.

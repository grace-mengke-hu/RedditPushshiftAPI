23, smoked since 17, I chain smoke all day in my apartment &amp; roll cigarettes so no idea how much I smoke — a shit ton. I don’t know where to go, patches never worked in the past. I have not committed to vaping ever (I have little money/no job). I get bronchitis off/on regularly.

I am very addicted as suggested in title. I have numerous mental health issues and smoking has been like a best friend for the tiniest stress to the BIGGEST issues.

Concerned I may be developing COPD based off of symptoms I have been experiencing over the past several months.

Funny, I promised I would never be a smoker when I was a kid as my mother and all her boyfriends smoked constantly around me and made me feel ill. I didn’t think I’d have other addiction problems either then though.

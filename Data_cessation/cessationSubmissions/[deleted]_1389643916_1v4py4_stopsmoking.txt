Quitting and Insanity?

I'm on my second day of this journey towards a cigarette free life, and im also in my second day of this insanity work out. Though it's only been two days, I'm feeling good. My question to you guys is as follow: have any of you guys use a work out program while quitting, if so, how did that turn out for you?

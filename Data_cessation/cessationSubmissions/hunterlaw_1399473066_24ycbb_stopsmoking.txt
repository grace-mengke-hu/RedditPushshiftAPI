It's beginning.

I thought it was just one of those "before bedtime reality checks." That I would just wake up and not remember or not care. But, today I start. I woke up and had no urge to chain smoke the five I do when first opening my eyes. I smoked two in four hours and started chewing my gum. Tried another one a couple hours later, was disgusted. It felt weird, tasted weird and I was annoyed that I even had one in my hand.

Having horrible asthma, that has put me in the Hospital more times than I can count, this needs to be done. Three packs a day for the past two years, I'll be 20 on the 23rd, couldn't ask for a better gift to myself than to be looking at a healthier life for the future. 

Couple questions!
Did your eating habits change?
If you already had mental health problems, did quitting affect them?
Was there a quote that truly got to you, and pushed you to keep going?

Hoping for some support as I will definitely need it, tips and tricks that really worked for you, quirky or not. Thanks ahead of time guys!

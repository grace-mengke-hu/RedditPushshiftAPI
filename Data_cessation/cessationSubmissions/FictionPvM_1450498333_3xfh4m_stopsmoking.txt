Am I making a terrible decision?

I would like to continue to drink as I quit smoking. I am not a heavy drinker but I do let loose more than usual on occasion. Do you think it's a good idea to condition myself in a controlled environment? I.E. Drink with non smokers/ those that won't give me any, at my home, then eventually go out in public where I'll be around smokers? Sorry if this question is hard to follow, as I have started the conditioning this evening..

Day 4 for me today

I quit smoking because it affected my sports performance. I'm not a professional athlete, but I saw a downgrade in my physical abilities and decided to quit. Started mountain hiking as of late and previously hit the gym on a pretty regular basis. I quit the gym ~6m ago and started working out in the morning or afternoon instead. If you want to know more, ask and I'll reply.

Just dropping in for accountability

26 year old male dropping in for accountability. I've dipped, smoked then vaped for the past 9 years. I've attempted to quit a handful of times with the most successful duration at a year. I'm SO sick of being tethered to nicotine, the anxiety of not getting my fix, and the prospect of health complications. 

I gave up the vape 4 days ago, and even though I was only at 3mg, my addiction to nicotine is incredibly strong. The last 3 days have been treacherous. It's now day 4, and mental clarity is returning. Reading all the posts here has helped immeasurably. I'm tackling this addiction one day at time, not making any promises, just doing the best I can in the present moment and ultimately being true to myself. I'm better than this shit!

Thank you all for reading and good luck on each of your journeys.

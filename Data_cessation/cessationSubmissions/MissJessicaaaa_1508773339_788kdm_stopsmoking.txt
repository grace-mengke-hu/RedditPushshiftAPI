Second time quitting, LETS GO!

First time I got to 70 days. This time there won’t be a -next time-. 

I’m 7 days in without any help (patches/gum) and housemate is a smoker and isn’t really helping or wanting to quit themselves so that makes it difficult  (they will offer me them if they see me have the slightest change in mood, thankfully my self control is better now) 

I haven’t really told my family and friends that I want to quit, a lot of them are smokers and I feel like they won’t support me, hence why I’m posting here so I’ll feel like I’m letting a ton of people down (as much as myself) if I try for one again. My partner is my biggest inspiration though, hoping to start a family soon so it’s time to quit forever!

WE CAN DO IT!

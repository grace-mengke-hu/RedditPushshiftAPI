I want to quit

I’ve been wanting to quit for a few weeks now. I drink once or twice a week which triggers the smoking. I am more than ok with stopping both. I want to quit right NOW. I am afraid to quit without patches because I have three young children and it isn’t fair for them to have a grumpy mom in no fault of their own. Any tips to get me through without using patches?

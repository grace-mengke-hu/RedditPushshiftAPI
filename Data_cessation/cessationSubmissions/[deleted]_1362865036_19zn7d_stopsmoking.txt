Twelve days. Big time cough and MAJOR MAJOR acne. Is this related or not?

So yeah, been 12 days (WOOT!), and I've heard before that the cough comes with quitting. Coughing up lots of nasty stuff. But what I'm not so sure about is whether it's related that my mug is now peppered all over with unhappy goo geisers. Seriously, all fucking over, in places I never had acne before. Is that related or am I going through some weird mid-twenties second puberty?

Crazy Nicotine experience. Panic. Help!

I had chewed tobacco for 10 years, but about three weeks ago I started using a 21mg nicotine patch because I really wanted to quit.  Everything was going fine until about ten days into the patch, I have a sudden panic attack, heart beating hard, can't sleep, can't eat.  I am really freaked out, so I take the patch off and then later that day, I go buy chew to try to get back to "normal". This doesn't help and so I go to a counselor who tells me that it was probably a bad reaction to the nicotine patch and that getting off nicotine is probably best. 

 I gave up cold turkey, last wednesday with my families support and it hasn't been too bad.  The doctor has prescribed me .25mg xanax in case any more panic attacks happen (I haven't had to take any yet). I think that going through all this made me not want any more nicotine, so I haven't really had any standard cravings to chew.  I feel like withdrawal has been strange, I just feel off, and I still don't have much of an appetite and am having a hard time sleeping.  

I have now been nicotine free for 5 days and 5 hours. Can any of you give me any insight into what might be happening with my mind/body after this rollercoaster, and whether my body is in withdrawal or if I can expect any relief? If so, when?

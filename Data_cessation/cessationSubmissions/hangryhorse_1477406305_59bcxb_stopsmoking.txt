How should I get high without risking using something nicotine based?

I've stopped smoking but still want to get smoke weed. I'm not in the US and clueless when it comes to good vaporisers etc. Is there anyone that can help me? I'm pretty low on funds although I suppose if cigarette free life works out I should have some more money coming in!

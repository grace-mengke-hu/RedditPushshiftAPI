Quitting quitting

I have been smoking about a pack a day since I was 20. I'm 36 now. I have been trying to quit on and off for about 10 years.

Longest I went without it was 3 weeks. I have set countless milestones over the years. I would quit when I finish school. When I get a job. When I move to a new apartment. When I get engaged. Married. When wife is pregnant. When the baby is born. When he's one month old. After this pack. After next pack. On Monday. 

I've failed countless times. Almost every single time, my reasoning was, "How cool would it be if I can just have one a day, after dinner." I've always been jealous of those people who can have that casual, social smoke. And maybe not even finish it, put it out and not look back for a week or more. 

I can do maybe 3-4 during the day but after the wife and the baby go to sleep and I'm alone with my thoughts and troubles, I chain smoke 4-5 back to back. Get some tea, repeat. A bit on Reddit, repeat. While dreaming of quitting, among other things. I think I just smoked 9 cigarettes in the past hour and a half. 

I hate it. I hate the smell. I hate that my wife and kid can smell it on me. I'm sick of the filthy balcony and the mountains of butts in old flower pots. I'm sick of the holes in my clothes. I'm sick of spending a fortune on it. Doing the math depresses me. But most of all I can't take the guilt anymore. I have an amazing son and wife and I just can't waste our money and my health on this ridiculous habit. I already have other health problems and I'm terrified of just ruining everything.

On Wednesday my son is turning one. And no, I'm not waiting until then. I'm all out and I'm not buying a pack tomorrow. This time I'll make it. I have to. 

I just thought sharing this on here could help somehow. Thanks for reading.

edit: wow, thank you all for the tips and the encouragement, I really appreciate it.

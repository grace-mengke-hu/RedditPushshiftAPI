11Days on NoSmoking but !

But my Friend who is still a Chainsmoker , he meets me daily and forces me to smoke cigarette and have only one puff ! . I feel he is not my friend , because he actually dragged me into smoking thing . I was happy with my sandwiches . I feel good company is very important.

So my question is , because of having lesser friends i kept on meeting him again n again , and smoke in front . What to do ? Or i should maintain difference .??

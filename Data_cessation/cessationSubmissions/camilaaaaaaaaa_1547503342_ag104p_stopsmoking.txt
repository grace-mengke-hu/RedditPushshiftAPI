Rollercoaster

Feeling a bit like on a rollercoaster. 
Stop smoking made me feel good about myself. I feel strong. But when I see someone smoking, I crave cigs. It will pass. One week now! Cavings are stronger, I dont know why. Maybe its because I feel healthy again. There is NO positive thing that comes with smoking. None! I can still go outside by myself at any time. I dont need justification.

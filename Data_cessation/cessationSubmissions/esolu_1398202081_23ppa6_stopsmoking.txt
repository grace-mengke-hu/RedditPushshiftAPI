What's the last trigger you drug out into the light and beat down?

For me it was a night of gaming.  I haven't really had a "hardcore" night of video games since quitting.  They used to be littered with fast smoke breaks, and a few back to back at the end of the night before going to bed.

It was cool to feel the craving at the end, shut it down and move on.  It's been a LONG time since I've had the opportunity to knock down a trigger.  

I wish I could put them on a rope and wear them around my neck :)

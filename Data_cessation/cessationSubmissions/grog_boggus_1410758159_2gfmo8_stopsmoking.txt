I've had enough!

I'm currently 25 years old, and I was a smoker since I was 17. At one point I had quit for over two years and had relapsed after a particularly downward and hard time during my life, and have been smoking for close to a year again. I had not even realised I had been smoking for that long again until today, it had just crept up on me and I was back to a pack a day.

I've had numerous attempts over the year to quit, all which resulted in a silly relapse that I had tricked myself into each time. I had justified ruining all my hard work, and hated myself every time I light up again. Excuses every time, and horrible lungs and regret shortly after.


 I'm a regular gym goer, but after I started again my forms of cardio went to utter shit. I stopped running, and I stopped going to kickboxing. 

After an attempt at cardio recently I had realised how bad smoking had changed me, and it's time to call it quits for good. I hadn't really reached out on here, but it seems like it's time to get all the help and motivation I can.

I'm going running again this arvo, and tomorrow, and the day after. I'm going to live with the cravings until they are all but gone, and fight them to better myself.

I want my health back and this is a necessity in doing so.  Here's to ridding myself of this fucking poison! I hope you all stay strong and keep at it with me. Enough is enough guys!

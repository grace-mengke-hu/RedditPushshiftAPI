What are your experiences of physical withdrawals?

I started smoking with my girlfriend in my first semester of college. I just quit 10 days ago, after almost 2 years on the dot (smoking a half a pack a day). I'm sure it's different for a 2 year smoker compared to a 5, 10, or 20 year smoker, but I can almost literally say I haven't had any physical withdrawal symptoms. I read Allen Carr's easy way and that's what made me want to quit. He's right, it's been extremely easy. I was irritable for the first 3 or 4 hours the first morning, but other than that I haven't had any other physical discomforts. I'm wondering if anyone else has experienced this?

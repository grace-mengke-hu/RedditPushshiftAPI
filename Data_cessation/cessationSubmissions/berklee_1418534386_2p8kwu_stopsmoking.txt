Three weeks (as of this past Thursday) and counting!

Champix and a 0mg vaping oil.

Next year would have been 30 years, and I was at nearly two packs a day when I stopped. I've never come this far. It's still an uphill battle every day, but it's also a little easier every day as well.

Forward and onward!

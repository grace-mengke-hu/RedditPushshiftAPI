For those of you who have quit, how do you deal with short visits to smoker's homes?

I'm visiting my mother for a week, and I'm just shy of one year quit (January 10th). 

She smokes, inside. It stinks, and after being here, I stink, too. I'm ashamed to go out in public because I can smell it on myself. 

I'm only here for a week, so I'm not going to be washing curtains and walls or installing air filters, but what can I do to mitigate this stench?

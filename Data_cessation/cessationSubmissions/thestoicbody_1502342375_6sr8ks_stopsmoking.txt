My story with cigarettes (haven't smoked in several years)

Hey guys, hope everything's going well. 

***I'm just going to give you a brief outline of my story with cigarettes and how life and circumstances led me to quit.***

So I first tried a cigarette when I was 14. I was in the middle of a soccer field and I had one drag, I hardly remember that, but I remember that was the first time.

For years after that I never even thought about smoking, ironically I always told my dad to stop smoking when I was a kid. 

As I entered university I wasn't smoking cigarettes but I would party quite a bit, and drink a little (not too much).

Around my third year of university, I was feeling a bit lost because I didn't really know where I was going. I tried a few and yeah...you know how it goes I was eventually hooked. 

It became my source of comfort. You can always rely on them to lift your spirits, or so it seems. 

After a few months, I left to Canada for an exchange. It was really cold there (brrr). I smoked heaps here and I mean HEAPS, it became bad. I kept doing this until the following Christmas. On Christmas night I was staring at the dinner table I was just part of and realised I was enjoying the story someone was telling me and then realised I wanted to stay and listen, but I "had" to go outside for the smoke. The moment I realised this, rage and anger fuelled me and I stopped for good. I did have a few puffs here and there every few months just to test my self-control (not recommended) - but that was the end. 

Anger is key, become self-aware and try to have yourself realise that the cigarette is actually taking your sovereignty away. When you truly comprehend how humiliating and demoralising this is, it's impossible not to stop.

Thanks for reading, I'll answer what I can soon.

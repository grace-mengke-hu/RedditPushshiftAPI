Didn't realise quitting would be an existential trip.

I was going through some stuff and ended up looking through loads of old photos, mostly of me at uni or soon after. You can guess the photos - smiling with a pint and a fag on the go mostly. I'm 34 now and yet I remember how immortal and care free I was back then so it didn't matter that I smoked, I was young, my life ahead of me, let my future self deal with the quit, let him fucking do it. And now that I finally have quit I feel old. Like I've admitted to myself that I'm not young and immortal anymore and that old-man-future-self is now. AND ABOUT FUCKING TIME TOO! Christ. I never dreamt I'd still be smoking into my early thirties. Honestly. I should have put away childish things years ago. Still, better late than never!

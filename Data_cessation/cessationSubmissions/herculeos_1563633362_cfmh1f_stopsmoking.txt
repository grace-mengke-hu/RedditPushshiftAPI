80 hours

My lungs are still painful, I still have to cough, but I am just going to continue. More than 3 days have passed, that's 10% towards a full month. I expect my endurance to increase a lot in that time.

In fact, it is already happening. Yesterday I noticed how much easier it was to run. Multiple factors: I am also losing weight, I am training about every day and I am eating and resting better.

Will continue this for a very long time. My fitness level will go through the roof! :D

Goals:

* Win a triathlon. First, become the fastest runner. Try to do that for my next triathlon in November.
* Do a 5k in less than 15 minutes.
* Become a beast in brazilian jiu jitsu - a friendly beast, that is ;)
* Climb a 7a route before the end of this year.

It'll take a lot to do all of this, but it just takes one bad habit to sabotage these goals: smoking. So, here's to making good choices! I expect you to do the same, but don't do it for me, do it for yourself.

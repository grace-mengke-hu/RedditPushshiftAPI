Will my personality ever go back to normal?

I’m 50 days in (woo!) but I’m seriously depressed and really sensitive. I don’t feel the the same and constantly have the feeling of tears in the back of my throat. 

From all my research I know what is happening and why. But I sure could use a rough timeline to feeling normal if any of you could provide some insight. It would be appreciated. 

Thank you!

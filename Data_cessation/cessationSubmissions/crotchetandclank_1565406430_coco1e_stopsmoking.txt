First 24 hours done!

I started smoking cigarettes four years ago when I was waitressing in college. I measured out my life with smoke breaks. Six months ago, I got a juul because I figured it would be a healthier alternative with less chemicals than cigarettes, and I wouldn’t stink of smoke. Well that turned into quite an expense and life was just vaping every other fucking thirty minutes. I would go through a pod a day, sometimes less than a day, and get these awful headaches at night where I felt like the back of my brain was shrinking or something. I panicked when my juul wasn’t next to me or on my body, I rushed through meals to get the heavenly post meal hit, I vaped in the bathrooms at work every hour, it was the first and last thing I did every day. The juul is just so goddamn convenient that pulling from it was just like breathing. I started to feel very alarmed by my nicotine addiction, and I felt like a slave to my juul. I had already been a slave to alcohol and I just don’t want substances to control me like that anymore. So I quit and the cravings have been tough and manageable. I tell myself I see the craving but I’m not giving into it, that I want freedom more than nicotine, and that I have to go through these cravings to ease my body out of withdrawal and it’ll get easier. I feel so proud of myself for going 24 hours. I’m trying not to see nicotine in any positive light.

Is there anything a significant other can do/not do to help a smoker quit?

The question may not be entirely accurate. My boyfriend smokes, and I hate it. It's my least favorite thing about him, in fact. It's bad for his health, it keeps him distracted when he goes somewhere he can't smoke, it makes him stink, his kisses taste bad, etc. I'm sure anyone on this sub knows all the reasons I want him to quit, and I've told him all those reasons.

He claims he wants to quit, but I'm not convinced. He's down to 4 or 5 cigs a day which is much better than he used to be, but he doesn't make any effort to cut it out completely. Part of the problem is he works at a catering company with only 1 other employee who also smokes. He says that smoking lets them take breaks that last only as long as a cigarette and they feel motivated to work after smoking. Without his coworker quitting, I'm not sure he'll be motivated to quit. 

As someone who's never smoked, is there anything I can do to help motivate him to give it up completely? I know it won't work unless he makes the decision willfully. I try not to nag because I know that won't help. He has Alan Carr's book, but quit about halfway through. Any suggestions?

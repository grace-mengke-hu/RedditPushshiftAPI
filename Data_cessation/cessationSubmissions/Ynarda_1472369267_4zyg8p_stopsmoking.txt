How should I deal with smoking breaks at work?

I am planning to quit, again, but I worry about the smoking breaks at work. Those are the best parts of the day. We smokers gather together on the balcony and we light up our cigarettes. We make jokes and laugh and that's the only time we really bond with each other. 

How am I supposed to go with them and just stand there? What will I do with my hands? I fear I will not enjoy the breaks again and maybe they will not even call me when they are taking a break.

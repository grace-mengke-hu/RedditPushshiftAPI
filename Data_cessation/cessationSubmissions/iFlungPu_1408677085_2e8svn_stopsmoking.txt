Day 4 of No Tobacco!

After smoking tobacco for the past six years, today I am nearly done with my fourth day of no tobacco.  I feel so much pride in that, even though I know it is just a first step in what is sure to be a long process.  My fear is that next time I see my close friend, who in the past has always been the person with whom I share cigarettes and spliffs, that I will fall back into the routine.  But I'm hopeful too, because the last few days are the first days in a long time that I have not woken up hacking loogies.  Also I have already noticed improvement in my lung function when I play my favorite sport (soccer).


Anyway, thank you /r/stopsmoking for being a medium through which I can share my thoughts and hopes and fears.  I'm not sure why, but I don't feel comfortable sharing all this with the people closest to me.

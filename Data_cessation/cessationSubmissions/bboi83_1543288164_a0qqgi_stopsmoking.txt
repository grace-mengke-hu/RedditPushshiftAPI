Wellbutrin to stop smoking

My psych prescribed me Wellbutrin today to help the antidepressant I’m already taking. He also said it might help me stop smoking. I’ve been trying for the last year to give up this nasty habit so the prospect that this might help is getting me really excited! Does anyone have any experience with taking Wellbutrin to stop?

Thank you in advance for any responses!

Tips for night and party non-smoker, help me please ! :)

Hello guys,
I have been away from smoking for two months. I was not doing a lot of parties during this period but next week i am going to meet a lot of friends and most of them smoke and we will party hard. I already feel the pressure of nicotine in my body. Please help me with your best tips for not smoking during this night time !
Thanks in advance !

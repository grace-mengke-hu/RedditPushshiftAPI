iPhone app close to launch, looking for testers

I've posted a few times before about the app I'm building ([here](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/15q1tr/giving_up_smoking_tomorrow_would_you_like_to_take/) being the most recent) and I'm very happy to say it's now ready for testing.

As a reminder, the app is designed to help people cope with cravings and give them a greater sense of progress with their quit. About 70 people have been testing the missions and their feedback has been pretty positive, so I think I may be on to something.

This is for my Psychology MSc thesis and so is being run as an experiment. All findings will be made publicly available, the plan is to open source the app when the experiment is done and I hope the data people opt-in to give will help more people quit in the future. 

I'm looking for two things. 1) Does anything about the app break/not work/not function as it should? 2) Are there any elements that don't seem right to you, or ways in which the app could be improved?

You will need an iPhone, but if you've got one of those and would like to help please PM me and I'll tell you want the next step is.

The app will be free to download when it's released.

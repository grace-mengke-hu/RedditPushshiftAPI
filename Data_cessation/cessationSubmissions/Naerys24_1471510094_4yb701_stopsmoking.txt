I stopped, but I am suicidal now

Hey guys I am devestated :(

I stopped smoking on Friday afternoon. I stopped a week before that for like 2 days but I couldn't deal with it anymore, especially at work (I hate my job, and it stresses me a lot). So I bummed one from a coworker. So the overnext Friday I ran out of tabacco and just thought " I just don't buy one now, let's see how long I can go". Saturday, Sunday were pretty much fine. But when I have to go to work it is just terrible. I get suicidal thoughts a lot ( I suffer from depression too... so this just makes it worse) I think that nothing matters anyway, there is no reason to exist why shouldn't I smoke then?
The thing is that I will move to the other side of the world in October and finish work at the end of september, and I thought maybe it's better for me to stop when I don't have the stress of work etc... I am just scared I own't make it then... But I just feel so bad, the cravings are as strong today (Thursday- I live in Europe) as they were on Monday at work... 
Any advice? I feel like I can't take this any longer, I don't wanna torture myself this much... 
Thanks a lot...

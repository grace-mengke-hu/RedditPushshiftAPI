I relapsed after 14 days

I get this weird depression when I'm off nicotine. I can't enjoy things without a smoke anymore. The air smelled fresh and great, real spring smell. I had a steak for dinner and a beer. It felt incomplete and unsatisfactory. Like something was blocking the emotion of enjoyment, and I got an intense craving for cigarettes. I somehow knew I would fail before failing.

God damn it and I was so proud of myself for getting this far

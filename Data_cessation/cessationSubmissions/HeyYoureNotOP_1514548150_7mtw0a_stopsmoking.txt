Please help me, I have a serious problem with tobacco.

I've been smoking since i was 13, I'm 29 now. It's been over half my life I've been a smoker, and I'd really like to quit because I can feel my lungs working harder and harder every day, my breath stinks, and my teeth are absolutely disgusting from the smoking. Problem is, I've lived rough for quite a while, and picked up some habits during that period of time that I can't shake. If I run out of money for cigarettes, I'm more than happy to walk down the street, pull cigarette butts out of the trash bins, empty the tobacco out and re-roll it in to cigarettes, or smoke it through a pipe or bong. I've had and shaken drug addictions, and I feel like I need a baseline addiction to stick to, so I don't have to go back to the harder stuff I was doing, and I feel like I've gotten in control of my marijuana addiction at the moment, but the tobacco is always there and to me, always available because people throw out huge amounts of it. How do I re-condition myself to not consider this a reasonable option? It makes me feel disgusting, especially when people see me, but it does not stop me. Please help.

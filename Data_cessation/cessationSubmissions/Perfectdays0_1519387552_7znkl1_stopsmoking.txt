Question about triggerrs

Hello 
Im smoking around 7-8 years at this point and im 30y/o 
I really want to quit , because right now im killing 3/4 of pack only at evening (4-6 hours). Im a coompetitive gamer and I started smoking cuz i have some sort of ADD my whole life , it helps me to concentrate on tasks and most important on wining  (Actually i start wining cuz of sigs)

And my qestion is - i smoke when i play. its my biggest triger how can i deal with this?  I need to stop play? to not provoke nicotine dependence to kick in 

Right now i feeling very bad about my health and my dependence on nicotine. I try to stop smoking 3-4 times and it was just crazy my ability to concentrate was down to 0 , i cannot understand my emotions and cant take step back from them. It feels like rabiit hole. 
I want to stop smoking right now, but how can i deal with triggers?  


Sorry for bad grammar

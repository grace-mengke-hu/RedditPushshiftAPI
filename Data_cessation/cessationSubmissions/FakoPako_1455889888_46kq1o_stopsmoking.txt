I got this

Met up with my friends on Wednesday for dinner and couple drinks after work. These are the friends that I was avoiding. My buddy quit smoking 3 years ago, but his wife still smokes. We had dinner and some drinks. She would go outside every hour to smoke in cold. Not once I would wish I was there with her. Not once. I am so done with this shit. She smelled so bad. It's just weird to think that I was like that. Had that routine...putting my jacket on, making sure I have my lighter...taking one cigarette out of the pack...putting my shoes on...opening up a garage door and just stand there, freezing my ass off...sucking on this thing..just to do it all over again in an hour. How strange is that if you really think about it? Same thing goes at work. Going out every hour. 

New Year non smokers...tomorrow we will be in day 50! Half a way to 100 and just only 10 more days to 2 full months! TWO MONTHS! That is awesome. I am proud of myself and I am proud of all of you who stuck with it. This is something you should really brag about. 

I was just talking to my co-worker about working out and how much harder it is to drop weight once you hit 40. It's like a switch is turned on. He said:" Dude, your biggest thing is nicotine. You stopping smoking is huge and you should be really proud of it. That is not a small task"...you know what? He is damn right! Maybe that's why I feel like I can accomplish anything now?

Why you should quit now and not put it off

There are windows of opportunity where the **success rate is higher** and that window is open right now. 

You have a relatively higher chance of success if you quit today or in the next couple of weeks. I do not have the data to back this up, but Marlboro marketing department does. Sadly, they have some bright people working in their advertising departments, crunching numbers to figure out when people are most successful when they quit. To counter this, they run promotions by putting small sweeteners like $.50c coupons into packs where human cognitive biases make them go back and redeem. It's called ["loss aversion"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_aversion). While this might not directly apply to you (different brand, non-redeeming customer, etc.), lots of smokers follow through. It creates a causal chain and prevents you from breaking the habit.

Take a hint and think about that window of opportunity.

**Caveats:** Different regions have different market research data, so it might not apply to you directly if you're in a different part of the world. In Southwestern US it seems to be the case that Marlboro has began putting coupons into their packs from the end of August and beginning of September. This is a entirely deliberate and data driven. They don't flush millions down the toilet on a whim.

TL;DR - quit now because human biology is predictable and Philip Morris has 50+ years of market research data which tells them that September is a successful month for quitters.

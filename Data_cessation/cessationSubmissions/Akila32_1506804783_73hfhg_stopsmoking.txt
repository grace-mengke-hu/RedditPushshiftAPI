New to Reddit and new to non smoking

Hi all! I'm 4 days into being a non-smoker, I am uber proud of myself but at the same time there is a little voice in my head that is like "Go bum a cig from that person, think of how productive you will be if you get a little nicotine in your system... you haven't gotten shit don't in the past 4 days... can you really sustain that? Don't you care about your work more than that? Are you going to let it all just go to shit because of not wanting to smoke?" Ahhhhh. It's really hard, not to mention I am traveling by myself so I have no friends to meet up with or family to hang out with... i'm alone and that is pretty hard. I got the smoke free app, it sent me to this feed... anyway, thanks for having me here, I'm going to kind of force you to be my family for now. Also here to support you all at anytime! I'm so proud of each of you who are stopping such a stupid habit, let's all become addicted to smiling? Ha.

Cigarette taxes went up....again....

I bought patches and the gum before the taxes went up, for like the 39593rd time, because I've been wanting quit, in order to save money so I can actually do stuff, and sloooowly started to taper off. I posted once before a while back but that attempt was a flop.

Then cigarette taxes went up out of nowhere. Fuck. That. Noise. Haven't had a smoke in almost 3 days now and fuck me sideways this sucks. I know, we've all gone (or are going) through it. I just need a little tantrum party. This really sucks. Don't care enough about my health to motivate me enough to quit, but hike the already ridiculous tax up again? Nope. No. Nada. Not having that shit.

My current, shall we say, "romantic interest" is coming up in November, for a visit, and they already quit a year and a half ago, so I'd feel like a big ol dick if I lit up in front of them, so there's that. Plus I was planning on surprising them with bourbon, which they like and I've never had before (any recommendations to impress?? No idea what I'm looking for), which costs money.

Plus, I'm looking into a trip to Minnesota to visit one of my best friends who's rather sickly, a trip to Texas to see another best friend who just gave birth for the first time, and another trip to Iowa to meet up with old friends.

Blah. I know I have goals and such to look forward to, but damn. This is balls. Plus the anxiety. Holy shit the anxiety. I already had pretty bad situational anxiety to begin with, but man, I've been a ball of anxiety for the last (almost) 72 hours.....nearly constantly.... I was not expecting that shit.

Okay I think I'm good. This attempt is for real. Sorry about the dumb wall of text!

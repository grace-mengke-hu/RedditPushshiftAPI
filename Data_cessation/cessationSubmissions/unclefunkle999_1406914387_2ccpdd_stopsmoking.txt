Beginning my journey right now...

Hi everyone. After years of contemplating, trying and failing, and making excuses for myself, I've decided to finally quit smoking. The success stories and the support of this community have inspired me to do this once and for all! I just wanted to ask for any tips/advice on how to deal with the withdrawal symptoms and cravings. How did you guys make through the first few days? Thanks again for everything, and I wish all of you the best of luck on your journeys!

Day 4 Cigarette dreams

Hey y’all, 
In my fourth day no smoking and feeling great other than I had a very elaborate dream about smoking last night. Like, more elaborate and vivid than my usual dreams. Was very surprised to wake up and realise I hadn’t actually smoked. I’m not even sure if I’m looking for advice or anything, but I just want to tell someone about it who will know what I’m talking about.

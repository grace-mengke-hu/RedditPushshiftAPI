Almost a month without vaping! Thank you all so much!

I had been vaping for 3 years when I finally decided to stop. I originally did it because I wanted to "quit" smoking but in reality, I just wanted a less harmful way to fuel my addiction.

Nicotine never did anything good for me. It made me extremely anxious, dehydrated and irritated, yet I kept going, because I was afraid of what I would do without my crutch.

I read this subreddit and I decided that it was high-time to stop. I had intense cravings in the first couple of weeks, and I was definitely contemplating going back to nicotine. Instead, I decided to read Allen Carr's book Easy Way, replaced the words smoking with vaping, and I can safely say... It cured me! Now, I still get the occasional craving but I go back to what Allen Carr said about addiction and it all goes away.

Are there any benefits to not vaping? Well... I feel a lot calmer, less grumpy, I sleep a lot better and my average heart rate is finally in the normal range instead of the borderline normal one.

Do I miss the flavors? Nah, if I want strawberry, I just buy lollipops or strawberry juice. If I want coffee, I just drink coffee (maybe an addiction I should also kick). The clouds were never a reason for me to vape, there is absolutely nothing interesting about vaping, I just needed my nictoine so I can relieve the withdrawal symptoms that it caused in the first place.

Stay strong everyone. You've got this.

If you keep failing, try vaping

I'm not sure if this is allowed to recommend since everybody tries to quit but.. I've tried multiple times to quit and the longest was I managed was 2 months. Cold turkey, Allen Carr, nicotine gum, patches, eventually I started smoking again.

Today my vape came in the mail. I tried disposable ecigs before but they were pretty nasty and barely produced vapor so I went back to smoking fast.

The ecig I use is cheap and I'm blown away, it definitely does not give the complete satisfaction of smoking BUT it tastes miles better and produces amazing clouds that are fun to watch. I can't even imagine inhaling burnt crap anymore after half a day. I've vaped non stop for hours and don't feel bad or nasty like you do with chain smoking.

For me it's the perfect mix between a cigarette and a waterpipe.

Ofcourse I don't know how it will be in the long run but in case you were skeptical, give it a try.

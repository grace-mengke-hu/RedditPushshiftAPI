Just out of the hospital

I’m on day 3 of quitting. As I’ve posted before, I’d gotten very sick for over a month. Smoked a pack a day despite my body crying out for help. I just got out of the hospital because I woke up in writhing pain in my rib cage and admitted myself to the ER. i was short of breath and the right side of my chest was breathing fine, but the left side of my chest was barely moving. 

Panicked, thinking the worst, being a smoker for 11 years, i thought I’d have heart problems, lung tumors, the beginnings of cancer. Almost like it was planned, they placed me in a room next to a woman who just relapsed with stage 4 lung cancer. No clue if that woman was a smoker, but i have never taken a lesson so clearly: I’m not going to let that happen to me. Luckily, it was just some muscle spasms from my cough. Excruciatingly painful, but not too serious. They checked my heart and lungs and I’m so relieved, but also terrified and disgusted of cigarettes (which is great tbh). 

Despite the absolutely dreadful withdrawal and quitters flu I’ve been experiencing, I’ve fought off every craving. I know I’m only 3.5 days in, but about a month ago, I felt like i didn’t know how to survive an hour without a cigarette. And i went from over 20 a day to 0 a day. I feel like I’m in the rough of it all right now. Just had to post to keep patting myself on the back during the rough times

Day 36 - Accomplished

As most of my friends are smokers, they are unaware of what a feat this little accomplishment is. I have survived a habit that has lasted over 8 years. I have NEVER had enough self control to do something like this before.  Hell, I'm still eating a Hostess cupcake every night  (my true vice). 
I am moving forward, not backwards.
MAJOR FEAT IN MY EYES: I drank last weekend...even went outside with my boyfriend and DID NOT SMOKE. 
Slowly but surely, even my subconscious is accepting my Non-Smoking ways. Furthermore, I am one and a half days away from being able to buy what I've been saving for on my Non-Smoking app. Today is a day of pride :-D

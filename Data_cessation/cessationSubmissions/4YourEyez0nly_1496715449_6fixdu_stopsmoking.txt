Day 01: I've Finally Quit Because..

..I want to improve my sex life. Smoking decreases your blood circulation which makes your penis not 'that hard' when it gets an erection. Of course I will reap the other health benefits as well but improving my sex life is the main reason I have quit. 

I had my last cigarette at 10 PM last night so today is my Day 01. I would probably be getting laid in 3-4 Hours and it would the first time I would be having sex without smoking a cigarette before or after it. I'll post here after 7 days now.

Stay strong guys and girls!

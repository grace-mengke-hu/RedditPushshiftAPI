Just made 6 months yesterday!

Hey guys, just wanted to say I made 6 months yesterday, after 5 years of smoking

I vaped for a about a year or 2.  My friend accidentally roasted the coils after I just made them.  I smoked a cigarette, and decided I was done with both!

I think my approach was unorthodox.  Once I quit I started going to bars and drinking a bit more.  The urges were crazy, but I felt if I really quit, this shouldn't make me crack.

There is nothing wrong with vaping, but it's a great feeling when you're finally free of nicotine altogether.  I eat better, get fewer headaches, and get out of bed a lot sooner when I wake up in the morning.  I don't have to be a nuisance to those around me, and I don't have the anxiety of needing to smoke or vape, to be met with a let-down-of-a-buzz everytime :)

So my ex is trying to take custody or my child

So I've slipped in the last couple weeks. My crazy ex is trying to prove that I am an unfit parent. I know I'm not, but this is just another $3000 on lawyers that I have to pay to fight him. I just want to take my kid to Disney world with all this money I have spent. I am so frustrated.

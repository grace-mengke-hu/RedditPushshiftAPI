Day One

I'm sick and tired of worrying about quitting all the time. It's getting to the point where I've got so much anxiety over the fact I haven't quit yet, it totally negates any "benefit" I feel when I do smoke, but I keep justifying it to myself. No more. I'm done with lying to myself about how bad smoking makes me feel, and I'm quitting, today.

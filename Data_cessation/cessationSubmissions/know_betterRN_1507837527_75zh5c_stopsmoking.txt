Trying to quit is making me feel a bit crazy

I created an account just to post here. As my name suggests, I'm an RN, and I know better. I've been smoking since I was ten years old. Insert embarrassment. I'm now 31 and have 4 kids, whom I don't want to smoke. I associate smoking with nearly every activity, thought, and emotion you could fathom. I've got to quit. I have plenty of motivation to quit. The cravings I get aren't even that bad, but I keep smoking. I'm incredibly frustrated with myself. I obsess over the thought of smoking. I've been giving in and smoking 3 to 4 cigarettes a day to give myself a break from the obsessive thoughts. I try to replace the thoughts with thoughts of why I shouldn't and don't want to smoke, but I continue to obsess until I cave. The longest I've gone so far with no cigarettes is 20 hours, and I was asleep for part of it. It was 3p Tuesday to 11a Wednesday. Are these obsessive thoughts normal? If so, how long do they last? And why do I still want to smoke even though I don't want to be a smoker, if you can even make sense of that?

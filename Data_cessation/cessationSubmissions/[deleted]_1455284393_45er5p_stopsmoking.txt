Day 7 Hope to feel like myself again soon.

So I've made it a week. Actually haven't had much in the way of cravings or depression really. The main impact dropping nicotine has had seems to be a corresponding drop in my focus / concentration. Irritability / frustration were also at higher levels this week. On the plus side I can finally breath again and joined a gym to get back in shape. My goal for next week is to get my work performance back up to where it was when I was smoking.

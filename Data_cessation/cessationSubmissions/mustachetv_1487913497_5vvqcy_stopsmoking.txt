Anybody else out there on Chantix?

Hey y'all, day 53 here, just checkin in. Has anybody else here used Chantix to quit? I'm about to start my last refill on it soon and now I'm curious about the experience once I'm not on the pills anymore. Do the cravings come back/get stronger, since the pills are no longer blocking your nicotine receptors? 

I took Chantix once before years ago but kinda half-assed it and didn't stay quit (obviously). I'm having some side effects this time that I didn't have before, and considering tapering off if I'm going to have to go through craving withdrawals again anyway if I finish the rx. 

What's your experience been?

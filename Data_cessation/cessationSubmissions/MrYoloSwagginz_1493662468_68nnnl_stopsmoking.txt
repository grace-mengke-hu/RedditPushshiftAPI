Just something anyone might find motivational...

I have saved so much money already by not smoking that i've been able to begin starting my own business.

The money i have saved so far (and will continue to save) has opened up the doors for me to be able to start my own business that i have wanted to do for years. Its not much but its meant i have been able to get my own first van and gradually be my own boss. 

Its meant i can afford the insurance deposit, road tax & minor accessories and parts. But its also feeding my motivation to not smoke as i need to keep having the savings to be able to afford the running costs of my van. 

I have acheived these first steps soley by not buying cigarettes or tobacco and i am on route to my dream job. I still have a way to go where the business is concerned but things are falling in place and i can now afford the costs involved step by step.

This is a business plan i have had in place for years but i havent been able to raise the start up costs because i let my smoking habit take priority. (Around Â£300 p/m)

Just thought id share for anyone who may be in the same situation.

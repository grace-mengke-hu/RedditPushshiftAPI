Hookah

I have to admit, two weeks ago I smoked on a hookah while I was drinking. Didn't inhale. Had no problems resisting cigarettes before, under or after. Not the day after neither. Still haven't had a cigarette for over three months.

Question: Do you think it is cheating? I've been afraid to ask because I feel like I've cheated. Opinions, please..

Cigarette Nightmares.

It's been a week since I quit, and now I have a nightmare every night, but one thing remains the same. During my various ordeals, I light up a cigarette. 


Last I dreamt I was in a mass shooting and everyone I knew was there, bleeding. After the danger was over I had a cigarette while I tried to calm down. I knew I shouldn't, but I was traumatized. 


Every morning, I wake up still clinging to the shame of having smoked, even though it was an imaginary cigarette. Even though I feel shame for giving in, I still want a cigarette more than anything. 


Can anyone else relate?

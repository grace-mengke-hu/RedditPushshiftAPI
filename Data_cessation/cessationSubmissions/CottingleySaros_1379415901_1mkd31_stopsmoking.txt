Smelt Autumn today, then it all went downhill..

Today, I managed to go 9 hours and 45 minutes without a cigarette! (After battling that last cigarette where my mind was telling me that I didn't 'take the time to say goodbye' and I should have another to say adios properly. How crazy?) I even sat beside a smoker and never had a craving at all and this was first thing in the morning with a cup of tea!
The air was smelling great and I could breathe so easily but then, I had one and it all went downhill from there..

I could no longer smell anything, my hands began to shake after I had finished and I felt that there was a ball of something in my throat and even felt panicked, depressed and sick, which I've never felt before. I no longer felt 'aware' of what was going on, as if my mind was now dulled. All in all, it was pretty damn awful. And as disappointed as I am in myself, I'm sort of glad as now I have more of a fight to go on.

Does anyone have any tips on how to get through the first 24 hours? Has anyone experienced the shaking, queasy sickness? The mind numb? How did you manage to change your habits to get through them maddening cravings? Anything would be seriously, greatly appreciated.

*TLDR; Had one cig; turned into a shaking sick mess. Seeking tips on the first 24 hours please.*

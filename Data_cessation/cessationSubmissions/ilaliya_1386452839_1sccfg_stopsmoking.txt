Smoked for 10 years. Quitting again.

Quitting again! About 3 days in, which means its serious. The first 48 hours are always the hardest in my opinion.

Started smoking at 26 because I was young and bored, and it gave me a buzz. And it legitimized hanging around outside and doing nothing. If you sit in a park alone and smoke, nobody thinks twice. If you sit in a park alone and do nothing or watch the clouds, there's something wrong with you. And let's face it, smoking is fun. 

When you're a smoker, you look forward to those moments where you have to wait for something.

Longest time I quit was in 2007 for a a little over a year, because I moved to a country with awful cigarette brands. Started smoking again because stress of new job in a country with less-awful brands. And honestly, not smoking forces you to deal with day-to-day problems all at once. Smoking is a coping technique, and in my case helped relieve stress because I could deal with a problem, smoke, deal with a problem, smoke, etc.

Quitting again.

Why? Prevents me from being happy. It's fun, but so is living life. Smoking rewired my brain so that instead of seeking enjoyment from recreation, or social experiences, or travel... I would seek enjoyment from a cigarette. Smoking isn't the only thing that has this effect, but it's *a* thing.

The worst part about quitting smoking is *not-smoking* forces you to do a bit of introspection. Or maybe that's the best part.

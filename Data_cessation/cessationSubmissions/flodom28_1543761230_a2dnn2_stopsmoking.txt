Am I at risk

Hi guys, 

I smoked very lightly for about a year. I reckon around 300 cigarettes at most over a year. Went cold turkey and it worked but I’m a massive hypochondriac, so my mind now is telling me that I’m going to contract cancer in like 10 years (17 now btw). Can anyone tell me how likely it will be?

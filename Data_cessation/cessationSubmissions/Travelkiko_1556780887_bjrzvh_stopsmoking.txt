One week

I can't believe its already been a week. Saving the money, and not smelling like an ash tray are great bonuses, but seeing how I've already saved my lungs from 120+ cigarettes is an amazing bonus! 
Good luck to everyone out there on the fence about quitting, just do it! One hour turns into one day, and then you want to make it to day two and so on. I hope I can keep it up, and that you all can too!

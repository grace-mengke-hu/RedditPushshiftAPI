How I achieved freedom almost a year ago

October 18th, 2015 was my first day of freedom. I refer to it as that because I was in fact set free from a prison I had willingly entered into 15 years or so earlier. What started as small visits in the early years, gradually became weekend long stays, and ended in a 10 year long permanent stay. The self-imposed prison might be an overused analogy, but that's only because it's true and efficient. 

This might come as a shock to a lot of people, but I haven't had a single craving for a cigarette since my first day of freedom. Nor do I expect to ever get one again. The reasons behind that lies in the wisdom gained from the many failed attempt to break free from my self-imposed prison throughout the year of 2015. In essence 2015 became the year I got serious about getting the hell out of there, and decided to keep having at it until I got out. Did I spend an insane amount of time trying to achieve the perfect escape plan? Oh yes I did. Was it all worth it in the end? Hell yeah! 

I tried, I failed. I tried again, and failed again. I asked myself why I kept failing, before I tried again and failed again. For every failure there was something I hadn't thought of, or something I was unsure of how to deal with. I was conflicted by voices telling me that it wasn't supposed to be hard, and the voices telling me that I couldn't do it. Then it hit me: Every single thing I've accomplished in my 34 years (at the time) on earth has come from two things; Acquiring knowledge to gain enough insight to succeed in whatever I wanted to succeed in, and perseverance. I've always wanted to get to the bottom of the why's in life, and I've rarely given up until I've gotten there. So the question became "why is it so hard for me to quit smoking?" and my goal became to figure that out. 

I can't point to one single thing that ended up being the answer above all others, it was the sum of it all that gave me the assurance that when I woke up on October 18th 2015 I would never smoke again. I will however point out that I've read Allen Carr's "The easy way to stop smoking" two times, the first of them several years ago. I also spent quite some time reading articles on http://whyquit.com/joel/, after that site kept popping up in my search results on Google. Most of all I analyzed my own addiction, and my own struggles with getting rid of it, by writing in a quit journal before, during and after my quits. The struggles that came out of a failed attempt ended up being the topic of the day when I went searching for articles or people's similars experiences online. 

The thing I struggled the most with, which ended up being the thing I battled with the longest was anxiety. During the first 2-3 days without nicotine I felt like a nervous wreck. I would burst into tears without having any idea why, and 30 seconds later I was feeling okay again. I had the knowledge that nicotine's influence on the brain can be quite severe, and that when you take the nicotine away your brain rebels against you in an attempt to get you to supply more nicotine. Somehow that wasn't enough to calm me down, so for every attempt to quit it kept happening, and I kept giving in. Part of it was clearly my stubbornness working against me. I was so convinced that I was going to prove to myself that quitting smoking wasn't hard, that I gave up quitting again and again because I found it to be hard. I was stalling. 

I vividly remember the point of no return. One night as I was getting ready for bed (during a quit) I felt another wave of emotions coming my way. I sat down on the bed and allowed it to pass, almost used to it by now. Then I said these words out loud to the empty room: "If this is the effect and power nicotine has over my brain, I want it gone for good." The next day I sat down to write about the fears I had about this anxiety becoming permanent in my life if I quit smoking, that I would return to the state I was in when I went through a depression in my early 20s. As I was writing it dawned on me that I was a "casual smoker" in my early 20s, more or less in a constant state of withdrawal. The emotional overwhelment I would experience back then could easily compare to the ones I was experiencing now. I had my answer. While my depression back then was real, and linked to issues I have later resolved, it was most likely also made worse by smoking. That self-therapy writing session carried me into the final quit a few days later. The overwhelming emotional episodes happened then too, but I was no longer worried about them. I told myself that once the nicotine went away, so would they.  

Allen Carr talks about having that defining moment when you KNOW you're done smoking, and as I was reading that in his book I kept telling myself it was the most ridiculous thing ever, because you never really KNOW anything in life the way I see it. Then on my fifth day of freedom, this tiny yet firm and sudden feeling of relief came over me. I wasn't even doing anything of importance, or even thinking about the fact that I had quit smoking. It came and went in a flash, but I remember thinking "that was my moment, I'm free". 

So, what can I give you all in terms of advice? After all that is mainly what this community is about, and I want others to experience the relief and freedom I have. So, I've compiled a short list.

* Educate yourself about what nicotine is and how it affects your body.
* Educate yourself about YOUR OWN addiction. What role and purpose does nicotine have in your life? 
* Don't use NRTs, you want to rid yourself of nicotine so that would defeat the purpose.
* Be kind to yourself. Experience the ups and downs, and watch them come and go. 
* Eat like you normally would, but try to drink more water if you don't normally do that.
* Don't shy away from situations that are triggering. Face them head on, and you'll find them disappearing after one or two appearances. 
* Failure is only temporary. Learn and move on.
* You don't have to "replace" smoking with something else. What you end up doing with that time you usually spent smoking will happen naturally.
* Think about it. Never ever try to avoid thinking about smoking and/or quitting smoking. Finish the thought, if it's a craving debate that shit down with your knowledge. If it has the audacity to show up again after that, do it again.
* You deserve better than what nicotine offers you, so keep reminding yourself of that.

It seems like a lot of work, and it seems time-consuming. If you are currently smoking I'll guarantee you that the amount of time you spend thinking about smoking, mentally planning to smoke, and actually smoking, is insane! When you decide to quit you still spend a lot of time thinking about it, but you're thinking about it differently. If time is your excuse, you only have time to gain by quitting.

Now, go be free!

Day 2 and I can not seem to focus

So I am on day 2 and I can not seem to stay focused on anything.  I am sitting at my computer working on a website and watching Mad About You and I find more and more that I start watching and totally forgetting about working on the website.  In fact I have found myself losing my train of thought while typing this out like 4 times.  Has this happen to anyone else?

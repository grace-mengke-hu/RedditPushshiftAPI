I was happier when I was still smoking. I need help.

I'm the type of guy that lives for the weekend. I party a lot and the things I do during the weekend make my happiness. It feels weird to say this but I think I was happier when I smoked. During the weekend I went to the bar/club, had some drinks and smoked cigarettes. My weekends were the best; I really enjoyed them and they made me feel happy. I haven't smoked for almost a month now. If I go out now, I always feel like there's something missing. The evening is not complete anymore. I feel really close to getting back to smoking because that would make me so much happier. To be honest, I don't really care about my health, money or the other /normal/ reasons people try to quit smoking. I just tried it out of a test for myself. But now I don't see the point anymore.

I'm still looking for tips, help, etc. 

Anyone who has felt the same?

From a newbie to those who quit long ago, a big thanks for being in this sub.

Just a little appreciation for being an example. My social circles aren't always encouraging and to see others who've been strong is extremely helpful to me. I'm a competitive dude so seeing your badges and reading your posts makes me want to be where you are some day.  Thank you for being here, it's a big help for a lot of us.

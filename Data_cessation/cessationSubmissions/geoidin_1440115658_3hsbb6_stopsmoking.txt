45 seconds away from target. Quitting smoking is my biggest this year.

When I started going to gym last year (when i was smoking) my average speed of running was 6 kmph and I could do maximum of 3 km at one go. Fast forward a year later, my speed is 13kmph and I can run almost forever at 10kmph (Most I have done is 7km). There was a competition at my gym and my time is now the second best! Sorry for the brag but hope this is inspiring for others who want to quit.

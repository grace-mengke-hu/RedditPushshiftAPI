2 months down!

I can't believe I've been cigarette free for 2 months already. I still struggle with the "breaking positive associations," mentally craving one when I get super stressed, but the longer I've off them the longer I want to be off them. I still have work to do, weening off snacking and stuff like that, keeping my stress levels down, but logging in today and seeing that 2 month badge has made me feel amazing. I never thought I would quit and look at me now.. 

I promised myself when I reach 6 months I would dye my hair pink, ya'll wait for that day!

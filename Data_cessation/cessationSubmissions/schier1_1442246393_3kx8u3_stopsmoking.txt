One month smoke free. I got a star!

I feel good.  
I certainly smell better.  
I don't have to stop what I'm doing to go have a cigarette.  
I've saved a ton of money.  
I don't have to deal with dirty ashtrays.
I don't have that horrible smoker's cough anymore.  
Gees, why didn't I do this sooner?

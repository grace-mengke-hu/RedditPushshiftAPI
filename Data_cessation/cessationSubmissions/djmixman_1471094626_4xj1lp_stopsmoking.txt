To those that say they can't do it, today marks my two year anniversary!

Just do it! Toss those smokes and get at it! 

And if you fail, try, try again...

Two years ago today I put out my last smoke. My son and I went on vacation with one of my best friends and her family. She put up with me the whole time even though I was in such a pissy mood and was basically crying for a cigarette. She stopped me from smoking a bunch of times. I give her tons of credit for dealing with me.

That's about as motivational as I can get. If it helps one person at all, i've done my job.

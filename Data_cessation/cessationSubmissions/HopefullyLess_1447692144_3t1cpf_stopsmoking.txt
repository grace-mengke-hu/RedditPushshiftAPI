I think I can deal with every single trigger that I had

I got rid of the urge to smoke when hearing certain music.

I resisted when a friend visited and we were walking outside.

I don't want to smoke at home. I don't want to smoke at uni.

Currently I'm extremely close to a mental break because of ongoing construction noise over the course of almost two month. My lawyer appointment is tomorrow. I'm walking circles at home and wish for it to stop all day.

The part were I'm literally going insane aside, you know what? I don't want to smoke.

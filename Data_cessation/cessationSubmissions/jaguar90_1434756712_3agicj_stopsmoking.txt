10 days down and just discovered this page

So I had an ear operation 10 days ago and was very strongly advised not to smoke as part of the recovery or it could undo the op. Some pretty heavy advice right there!
First 3-4 days were absolute hell (especially as I was signed off work so sat around the house which I simply associate with sitting, watching TV and having a beer and a smoke). Wish I'd thought to look for an app or a page like this sooner...
Anyway, as lots of timelines suggested, cravings slowly decreased until I realised today that I hadn't really fancied one at all yesterday.
This evening's been a struggle though - nobody else is home and I'm just sat on the sofa watching a film (and my word, everybody seems to smoke in films?!) which is prime smoking time. Sought out an app to make myself feel great and found the link to here, and then spent about 15 mins reading previous posts. Massively helps. Cheers guys!

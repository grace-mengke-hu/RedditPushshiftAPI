After taking extended breaks from smoking, today is my second day smoke-free, and the day I quit smoking.

I wanted to leave this note here for emotional support, and because I needed something physically present to help solidify my decision to quit smoking. I dont have much social interaction due to my job (yet) and so I thought this subreddit would be a good idea due to it's anonymity yet earnestness.

 I had been taking month/two month long breaks from smoking a few times a year for the past two years now.  This allowed me to understand and weather through the physical roller-coaster ride of withdrawal, and helped me react to and try to control the emotional rage that comes along with withdrawal. 

But, taking breaks meant that I will eventually go back to smoking so, paradoxically, that helped resist smoking in the short term.  Quitting is the only solution to smoking cessation for the health benefits, and this is why I will quit. 

 My prior experience has taught me the less I think about smoking the more manageable the cravings in the long term.  So I look forward to coming back to this subreddit and updating you on my progress March 1st.  Till then, All the best!

Nicotine withdrawal from smoking joints with tobacco?

Will i experience nicotine withdrawals if i stop smoking joints mixed with tobacco? For the past four or five months i've been smoking usually 1-2 joints a day, with some days joint free, and some weekends up to seven or eight a day. My friends all smoke so they mix tobacco in with the joints, approximately one third of the joint is tobacco. I dont smoke cigs or tobacco alone, only mixed with weed. If i stop now, will there be noticeable withdrawal effects?

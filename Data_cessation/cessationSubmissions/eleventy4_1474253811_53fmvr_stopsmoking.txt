Quitting tobacco by switching to vape. Thoughts?

There doesn't seem to be much research because it's relatively new. Much like using gum or the patch, I'm trying to quit 90% of the habit by substituting a new, most likely less harmful one. I've gone 48 hours now without a puff of a cigarette. I was a pack and a half per day smoker for twelve years and this is the best I've done, ever.

Does anyone have thoughts, insights, tips, warnings, or anything else about this method?  

Keep on fighting guys! We can absolutely do this.

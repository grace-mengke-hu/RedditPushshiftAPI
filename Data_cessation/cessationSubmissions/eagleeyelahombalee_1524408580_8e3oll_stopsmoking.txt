How to I get over smoking rituals?

I am not a heavy smoker but I smoke before and after meals as I have spare time and I get bored otherwise. I don't crave for smoke much on other times. Please suggest me ways to deal with this. 
Also, I am trying to quit alcohol as well as smoking at the same time. Will it work?

Day almost 17 - massive craving, crazy rambing in that state

It's 2am here, I have an unbelievable craving right now. I won't smoke, I have nothing in the house and I'm not leaving it now to get some cancer sticks. It makes me kinda hate myself right now cause I used to leave my house at 2 or 4  if needed cigarettes and had none. I travel tomorrow for 6h, then a 5h break then another 12h bus drive. I am afraid I'll buy a pack tomorrow. Please tell me why I should not. I hate them but i used to smoke a lot when i was stresed. I was stresed today because of a lot of things to finish before the trip and a house full of guests. (I had Slava, look it up, it's a cool tradition if anyone cares). There was a lot of smokers here. I have an aunt, 65, she has thyroid, lungs and joints diseases, smokes 1.5 packs a day. Her sister, other aunt has also like 5 different conditions, smokes 2.5 packs a day. She's like 70. They smoked since high school or so. Third sister looks 65 but is around 55, smokes at least 2 packs a day too and i believe she is extremely mentally ill. Those are my dad's sisters. Their oldest brother died as a drunk and a smoker. Their second brother stopped that around 10 years ago completely. My dad never smoked or drank. I was trying to make a point that all smokers are losers in a way. I feel that if i fail now it's like i fail a character test. Never succeeded for this long but i still feel extremely bad about cigarettes a lot. I feel bad in general too over random stuff. Now some idiot neighbor is very noisy with his car and I hate the world again. There was also my brother and his new wife here today. She's preggo and they are happy. I think she never smoked and he quit a few years ago. He was way more nervous person then. I believe I can go trough this too. This is quite bizzare, a substance lest my body almost 17 days ago and i still feel messed up because of it.

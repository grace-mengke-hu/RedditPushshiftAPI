4 days!!!!

Wow.   I made it four days....   Not going to lie, I cheated twice.   There's a lot going on right now and I succumbed to the "emergency pack".   But, both times I told myself "you're letting cigarettes win", and didn't even finish them.  The e-cig is a joke (thanks u/drpinkswife for the heads up - you were SO RIGHT!!!!). 


I credit a lot of my newfound success to the app, and to re-reading my earlier post in which I stated my reasons for quitting.   Every time I've had a craving, I've read that post and reminded myself why it's so important to me to quit.    I'd recommend to anyone who is considering quitting to make a list of reasons, because it's pretty humbling/shameful to admit to yourself that smoking is better than the life you want. 


Thanks for all the support guys, and keep up YOUR good work!!!

is weight gain inevitable when you quit smoking?

Im about 8 weeks out from a Bodybuilding competition. Furthermore this entails that I get leaner and leaner till the comp itself.


1) is the weight gain from quitting smoking due to the craving ( hand to mouth movement) of food and lack of exercise? Or is the fat gain inevitable due to the slowing down of your thyroid production (t3) and so forth

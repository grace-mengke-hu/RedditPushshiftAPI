Stopping Smoking Is So Eeay, Do It Now !!

I've been a very heavy smoker in the past 1 year, i started smoking 3 and half years ago, and i Quit 12 days ago, and i must Say that it was very easy to do so...actually i can't believe that i believed otherwise.

the night i decided to Quit, I smoked and i wrote how i feel about smoking, and then i wrote in 7 papers, some affirmation, like : I am a Non-smoker now, I am now happier and Healthier and relaxed and i attached thsoe paper into the wall so i can see them everyday...and I did Succeed, Now i'm really Happier and Healthier and relaxed !

and one thing that helped me is Abstaining from any sexual activity, I needed Energy in order to make a Strong Decision, and I made it :)

In the past it was so freaking hard to Quit, but this time it was So easy and i even enjoyed it, friends smoke in front of me whenever i'm arround them and i didn't even think for a moment to Smoke! 

I'm here to say, Believe in yourself, It is All psychological ! Yes I felt some withrawl pangs like any one else, but i didn't attach them to Smoking, and soon they vanished...

What i did however is Going out a lot and drink beers.

btw I was smoking Cannabis too everyday for a whole year! 3 to 4 joint minumum every single day, the side effect were, sleeping less, and no appetite ! I got my appetite back Yesterday, and I'm very Happy that I did Choose To Stop the Madness of Smoking, It is really Disgusting Trust me.

The story of how I went from 40+ a day to none overnight with no cravings and no desires for tobacco - its been 7 days and I already know I'm free from these death sticks!

A few days before Christmas a couple weeks ago I came down with a serious case of strep throat -  my lungs and throat ached and burned, my neck was swollen, I had a fever, I lacked all my former energy and was extremely fatigued and could barely do anything besides sleep and...

&amp;#x200B;

Besides sleep and smoke cigarettes, to my shame and emberrassment... Despite the horrid feelings I was undergoing, my addiction for cigarettes trumped it all and I kept hacking away at those death sticks...

&amp;#x200B;

That was until one night, a few days into this messed up routine, when I felt sicker than I probably ever have been physically in years - chest aching and burning with a cigarette in my mouth... I finally cracked and said no more (I probably puked a few times, too...)

&amp;#x200B;

I finally realized my physical health both now and in the future outweighs any pleasure any cigarette is capable of providing me (which is none anymore as they make me sick as of today) and I quit smoking cigarettes officially. 

&amp;#x200B;

That was one week ago as of today, and I am actually really proud to say I have not even been tempted to smoke again after that night and I also haven't even had the desire or craving for a cigarette...

&amp;#x200B;

To be fair, I replaced the habit with the use of a nicotine vaporizor, but I believe vapor containing maybe two or three chemicals and some nicotine far outweighs any cigarette (which contains on average over 3000 chemicals per dart, many of which are obviously cancer causing carcinogens) when it comes to its affect on its users health.

&amp;#x200B;

I do plan to give up the vape one day, but for right now I am just appreciating my newfound freedom from one of the worst habits I ever took up - smoking cigarettes.

&amp;#x200B;

It's been 7 days and I already know I'll never smoke again.

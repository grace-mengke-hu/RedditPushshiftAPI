Day 2, pretty rough day but didn't smoke.

Hello, I have no one else to talk to so I'd like to share my achievement with you. This is my 3rd serious (had 10+ half-assed ones) attempt, my best run was 6 days without smoking.

I got bullied and got left out today as usual, people intentionally stepped on my new sneakers, someone stole my pen that was my grandmother's gift, made loud noises around me to trigger my vertigo and made fun of my physical appearance. I was exposed to verbal and physical abusement all day long. Moreover, I couldn't submit an essay on time and the professor told me that he will fuck up my exam mark.

I punched the walls, burst into tears, had suicidal thoughts, broke some glass and beat the shit out of my pillows. But I didn't smoke. I tried really hard to think rational and realized that this nightmare called "highschool" will be over but the damage I do to my body will be permanent. After a day of wanting to die, I finally have a reason to be happy. I feel worthy because I didn't let a substance make me it's slave today.

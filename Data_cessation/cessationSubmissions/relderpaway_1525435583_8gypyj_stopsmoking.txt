Question: Is smoking a cigarette ever worth it?

Answer: No. 

Very true for me at least. I want to say I've never smoked 'actively', but thats probably just a rationalisation for why I think I can get away with having phases where I smoke a little bit. Every so often I smoke when I'm out drinking or smoked joints rolled with tobacco, which stokes my nicotine addiction. This in itself is not worth it, but what happens later is more of an issue for me. 

When i'm working on a challenging problem I can get this feeling that just 1 cigarette would be really good right now. I'm already focused, but maybe slightly on edge, and the feeling is that having a cigarette might smooth the edge making everything nicer. But what ends up happening basically every time i give in to this urge is that it completely crashes the state I'm in. It just makes me feel bad and unable to focus, when i was mostly feeling good and being productive before the cigarette. 

The reason I feel a bit on edge in the first place is probably because of lingering nicotine addiction. The only thing smoking a cigarette does apart from crashing my focus is making the urges come back stronger next time, which i know can have a spiralling effect. Even though I know this is going to happen I still give in to the urge sometimes. Just wanted to write this for myself to crystallise something i'm already aware of. Giving myself a badge to draw a line in the sand and never give in to this urge again.

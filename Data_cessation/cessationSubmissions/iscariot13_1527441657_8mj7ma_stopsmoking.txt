48 Hours. Thank you Allen Carr.

I never thought I would be able to get to this stage. My previous attempts to quit were filled with lies. I'd sneak a smoke whenever I could and convince myself that I had gone the day without smoking.  

I think this time, could be it. I've never felt more positive about wanting to quit. This is the longest I've been off smoking. I started for the worst of reasons. and continued smoking despite losing that reason. Please let this continue.

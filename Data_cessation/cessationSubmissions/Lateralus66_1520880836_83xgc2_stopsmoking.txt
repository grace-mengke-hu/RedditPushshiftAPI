Not trusting my own self.

One of the worst aspects of nicotine addiction is that it makes you distrust your own self. Today I have a 10-hour long boat trip, travelling has been one of my worst triggers so far and I'm having a crazy internal conflict all day as to whether to buy a pack or not. The addict me tries to convince me that it'll only be this one pack while the sane me points out all the well known arguments against relapsing. Some days I feel I have an alter-ego in me that tries to sabotage the vow I made to myself to not smoke again. I've been 2 weeks smoke free and this sub has a lot to do with it so I figured out some rambling in here might help! Thanks for the support guys and keep going strong!! We can do this!!

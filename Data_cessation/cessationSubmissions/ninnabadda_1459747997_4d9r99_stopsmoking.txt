One thing I forgot about cigarettes...

... besides the disgusting taste, headaches, and self-loathing is that every once in a while after a smoke there's this weird, involuntary tension in my lower abdomen that squeezes so hard my balls hurt.  It lasts for a few minutes, essentially rendering me immobile.

Looking forward to my new quit date.  I feel like my quit date should just be right now, but  I don't think I have the energy to make it through the first two weeks again.

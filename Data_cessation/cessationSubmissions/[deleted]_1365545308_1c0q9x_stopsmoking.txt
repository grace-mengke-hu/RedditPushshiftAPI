100 days!!

My counter says 101 there, but it's a few hours ahead. Today is my 100th smoke free birthday!     
Times have been hard, but I never cracked. My best friend died, my uncle was diagnosed with cancer, I got terribly sick and a myriad of other things, but I never let myself crack. I really just didn't want to have to start over.     
Remember guys and girls, you never ever ever *deserve* a cigarette. This has always been my key thought that helped me refrain from sparking up.

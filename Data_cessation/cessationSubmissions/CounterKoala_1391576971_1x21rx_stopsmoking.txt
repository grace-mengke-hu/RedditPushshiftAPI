In a moment of weakness...

55 days down the shitter.

And I get to feel like a shitter, too.

For the past two days, I've really wanted a drink and a smoke (also trying to quit drinking mostly).  I really don't know why I had these sudden urges.  I didn't sleep a lot last week.  I didn't feel well for it, and it also made me unproductive, which didn't do me any better.  But I started off this week just fine, so I don't know what came over me.  Maybe it's just be dissatisfaction with my boring-ass job and my stagnant social life.  Maybe it's a bad case of cabin fever.  The spring couldn't come fast enough.

I remember baby's first cigarette.  I smoked two on the way back from the gas station and they've quite literally knocked the wind out of me.  I feel frail like I've just woken up in my 90s.  I breath, but it doesn't feel complete.  I breath softly, but when that's not enough, I have to catch up with several long deep breathes.  I'm shaking, and I'm cold.  My skin hurts.  I feel sick, like I have to vomit.  I'm bordering on lightheaded and the world around me seems misty.

Why the fuck do I do this to myself?

At least I don't have a craving for alcohol anymore, so I got that going for me, which is nice.

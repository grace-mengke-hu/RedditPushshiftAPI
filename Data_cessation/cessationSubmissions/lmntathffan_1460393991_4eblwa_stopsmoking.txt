Why is vaping viewed negatively?

Hey guys, 

First post, happily smoke free for the better part of a year. I really like this sub quite a bit - it seems like a great, supportive community for people who want to better themselves. So anyways, on to my main point - I've noticed recently that vaping is gaining this bizarre reputation. It's coming to be associated with douchiness, which strikes me as odd since I believe quite a few people have (successfully) used vaping to quit smoking. It's healthier, cheaper, and it doesn't make you smell like a burning building. I'm not an active vaper, so I'm not worried about how I'm being viewed, but my thought is that if vaping continues to gain a reputation as an activity for conceited, rich kids then people may be reluctant to use it as a means of quitting. Is anyone else with me on this? I guess it strikes me as bizarre because I can't really pinpoint where this stigma suddenly came from - a few years back, when vaping first started gaining popularity, all I heard were positive things. Now it seems like vaping's been shoehorned into the same category as hoverboards, trillbies, and Yolo 420 swag.

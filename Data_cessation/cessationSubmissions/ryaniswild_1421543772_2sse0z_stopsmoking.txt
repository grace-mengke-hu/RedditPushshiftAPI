1 Year done

I said it before a while a go but when I quit I hit some low points and very occasionally posted but mostly lurked through this sub and it really helped.

Today or tomorrow I will hit 1 year smoke free and I wanted to say thank you. 

There have been difficult times - pacing round the room with an unlit cigarette in my mouth whilst waiting for my dissertation results for example - but overall I am glad I did it.

So yes this is essentially a pat on the back post - bully for me I made it a year. But it is also a thank you post to this community just for existing and guiding through some tricky moments. 

Good luck to you all and never forget that 1. You can do it, 2. If there's a problem you're having it's  likely someone else has been through similar and can help and 3. Be most excellent unto each other.

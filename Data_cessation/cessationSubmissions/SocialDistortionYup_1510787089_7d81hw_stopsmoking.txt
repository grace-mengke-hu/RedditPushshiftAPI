Its easier to stay stopped then stop

A month ago I said screw cigarettes put them down and went 23 days without. No withdraws, hardly any cravings. I was so done that my mind blocked cigs out for 3 weeks. Well A week ago I 'cheated' thinking I could have just one. Ofc One led to 3, led to 5 a day. To 10. Today I've only had 1 ~12 hours ago and committed to quit again. But it's not easy this go around. I've been obsessing all day basically salivating as I drove by the gas station ðŸ˜‘ but I didn't stop. 
I can do this ... Why oh why did I give up 23 days. No matter my cravings I have to say nooo!!

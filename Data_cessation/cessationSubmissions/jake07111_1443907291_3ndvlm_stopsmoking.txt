2 Months---feeling great

Just wanted to give you guys some motivation, 5 year smoker and quit cold turkey 2 months ago. I dont crave as much as i used to, but i still do crave rarely. The cravings are easily passed and life is GREAT. Dont live for the moment with quitting, live for the future, the future is bright.

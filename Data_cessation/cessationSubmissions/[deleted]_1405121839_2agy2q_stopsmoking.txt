What to do when stopping badly influences your psychical illness?

Hi,

I've "stopped" smoking more than year ago after 16 years of smoking. I could go without a cigarette for about a month, then have a weak moment and have one (usually when I drink). Now I "upped" to smoking one-two times a week, but I'm not happy about it.

My predicament is paranoid schizophrenia. While I am in treatment for 4 years, all the medications have side effects, often serious (noticeable onset of the illness was about 14 years ago) .

That one cigarette at time helps, but I feel guilty thereafter - I immediately think it was a bad idea.

This is going to sound probably harsh, but after [reading about Uniquestring](https://pay.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/2aep3u/uniquestring_has_died/) I have to ask how bad the cancer is. I need to know which choice is shittier.

Day 8

Day 8 in the books. I've had to change some habits to stay a NON-SMOKER but it's working. I sit in the front yard instead of the back in the evenings. I take a bag of peanut snacks to the bar to keep my hands busy. When driving I keep a supply of sunflower seeds to keep my mind off wanting a smoke.i was so ready!!!!!

After a weekend of intense drinking and smoking, I'm quitting.

I feel like this will be a different and probably much easier approach to quitting cigarettes. I have been smoking pot for about 1 year and after getting into cigarettes I ended up chain-smoking both drugs without thinking about myself (and others) at all. 

This weekend was probably amongst the craziest (and funnest!) weekends of the year and being under the influence of too many drugs at once brought me to smoke two packs of cigarettes, unknown amounts of alcohol, and I'd say about 15 joints in two nights. I have never smoked that much in my life and am completely ashamed of lowering myself to that extent.

Tomorrow I'm signing up for Muay Thai classes and will start exercising at home and regaining the life I need right now.

Thanks for the great threads in this sub, I will be coming here every once in a while and update on my progress! I'm really proud of taking this choice.

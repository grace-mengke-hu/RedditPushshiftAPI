Extreme fear of moving into a new environment

Its been 30 days since I quit and I feel great about this aspect of my life. However, over the last 30 days I have also been in a very secluded environment away from friends, night outs partying and so forth.I have therefore had very little temptation to smoke. But now, the time has come for me to begin my grad school in London and I am petrified that I'm going to get back to smoking as my workload will be really high and so will my frequency of going out at night. I really hope I can manage to hold my resolve and would really appreciate any tips or advice on how to fully make this transition without lighting up again

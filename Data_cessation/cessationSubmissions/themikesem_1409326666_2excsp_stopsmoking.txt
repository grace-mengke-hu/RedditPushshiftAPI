Three Weeks Today: Lessons Learned from my Most Successful Quit

1. Throw out all smoking paraphernalia like lighters, cigarette cases, and of course, cigarettes. When I decided to quit I put everything in a bag and threw it out in a trash can outside. I wanted to make picking it up again as inconvenient as possible. 

2. Planning to quit after you finish a pack is planning to fail. I threw out half a pack when I decided to quit. I compare it to an alcoholic finishing their handle before quitting. The best time is now. 

3. Cut down for a couple days before quitting. 100 to 0 never worked for me before. When I limited myself I was forced to find ways to occupy my time without smoking. It helped. 

4. Be smart about entering a situation that you would smoke in before. Going out to the bar usually meant I'd be chain smoking. I talked to my friends and made sure they understood that would not be the case this time. 

5. Find a replacement vice for the first few days. I've eaten about 10 pounds of trail mix in the past three weeks. The salt and sugar help me get through cravings. I've needed it less and less as my counter climbs.

This might not be the best quitting method but it's the one that is working for me. Here's to the next three weeks and thank you all for the support. :D

Cheers!

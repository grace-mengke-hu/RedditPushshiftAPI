I've just smoked my last cigarette, I am tired and I need to quit now!

I've been questioning a lot of the choices I make recently and I know to quit smoking should be the first healthy lifestyle choice I need to make. I stopped smoking for about four months, but I started smoking again last month and I've been justifying the amount I smoke was okay because it was not a lot (2 cigarettes a day). Today I had a mental break down after an exam, knowing I did not do so well. I questioned why did I neglect study... It dawned on me that I've been neglecting my mental and physical health. 

I just turned 24 and I shouldn't feel so physically tired all the time, I want to start running again! I know it isn't too late. 

I'm posting this because I've been a lurker on this community for a while and I love how everyone gives each other support. I am writing this post because I need to put it into stone that I am going to quit!

I just stopped smoking and need help!

(Sorry for my shitty English I haven’t slept last night and my first language is French lmao)
So I have been smoking for all of my teenage years, from 13 years old to this day (i’m 19), and it’s one of the only way that I know to manage my anxiety and deal with the passive-aggressive feeling that gets to me sometimes, I am borderline and it was helping with it. But now I can feel myself, at day 1, losing my shit at everything and everyone because I don’t know how to deal with my cravings, if you have any advices to keep my mind busy on something else or anything at all that could help, I would gladly take it!

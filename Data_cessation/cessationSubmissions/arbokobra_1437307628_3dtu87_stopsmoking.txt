This feels amazing.

I finally did it. I don't think about smoking most days, unless I see a cigarette on TV. If I'm in a situation where people are going outside to smoke, I join them, and I don't partake - I just enjoy the smell and the social aspect. I sometimes weirdly *wish* that I smoked, in a kind of nostalgic way, but I know this is poppycock and i just don't anymore. I walk a lot faster now and am asked to slow down, just like I used to be asked when I was in high school. I still smoke weed and am going to move to vaporizing, but even as is, I feel so, so much better. This day will come for you, too, I promise! It gets easier with time - at least, it did for me.

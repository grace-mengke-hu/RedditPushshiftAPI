trips to the bank

backstory is that I'm not fond of using debit/credit when paying for anything and prefer cash as I always save my change and every 6 months roll up about 1k of cash and take it to the bank. 

I realized today I haven't gone to the bank in over a week. While walking to work I was remembering how I used to be at the bank every other day getting cash to buy cigarettes and just laughed inside at the thought of it. 

For anyone lurking right now quitting smoking has been the best thing for my bank roll. There's no doubt in my mind even if I wanted to smoke again I will not because of how much money I have wasted over the years.

My app right now says I have saved about $383 dollars in 41 days. I used to smoke about a pack a day. 

I love it and am never going back, that's my story.

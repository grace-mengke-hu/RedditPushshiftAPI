After 9 years of smoking, it's finally time to quit seriously

Last week I turned 21 and I realized that I have been smoking for 9 years (with a year or so break in between). I started smoking when I was in the fifth grade (just thinking about it makes me regret my decisions). I've always known that smoking is bad but I have not been able to push myself enough towards quitting.

This morning I woke up and went for a smoke, but it felt different. I had no sense of satisfaction when I was done, the effect was opposite, I felt dizzy and out of breath and that's when I made the decision that I needed to quit before it was too late. I allowed myself to finish the pack I had and then went to the pharmacy and got myself a pack of nicotine patches, since I had not tried that method yet.

What do you recommend doing when a sudden need to smoke should arise?

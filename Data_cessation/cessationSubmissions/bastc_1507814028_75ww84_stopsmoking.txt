Running and cycling

Time for some positive posts! 

When I quit I decided to go cycling or running every time I got too annoyed with myself. And I did. The first times were painful as I was in terrible shape: my first run (/walk/stumble) was 2 and a half kilometer and took me half an hour. My first bike ride was 4,6 kilometer and took me 16 minutes.

Now, 3 months later, I don't really get annoyed with myself anymore. Most of the time I forget that smoking even exists. But I learned to enjoy being active and I still run an ride my bike a couple of times a week. Last week I did a 65 kilometer ride in 2,5 hours and today I did a 10 kilometer run in an hour and 17 minutes.

Both are below average performances in the cycling and running communities, but as a 42 year old overweight ex-smoker, I'm pretty proud of myself!

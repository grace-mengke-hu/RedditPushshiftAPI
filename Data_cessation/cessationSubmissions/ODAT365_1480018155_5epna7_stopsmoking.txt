1 month free. Automatic subconscious changes that surprise me daily!

I'm a young single male. And this beautiful gorgeous lady walks past me, outside the mall in Ballito. 

I just had to turn my head in such a breathtaking moment. 

But all the breath in my lungs was immediately expelled with a bemoaning Argggggg when I watched her light up that darn coffin stick and puffed and puffed away. Sis.

What a pity, her flawless skin...? May she see the light too one day. Soon.

We are lucky to be free!
Born free, stay free!

Peace good people!

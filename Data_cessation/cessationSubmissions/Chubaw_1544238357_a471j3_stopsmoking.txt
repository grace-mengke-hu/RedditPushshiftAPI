Quitting cigarettes is like...

Quitting Cigarettes is like a guy/gal you used to see with a tremendous body, great personality and they gave you good lovin all the time. Why would you want to quit that? 

But then one day you’re out with them, having a great time eating ice cream and you find out they are a professional puppy killer. 

You love them, but damn they’re so bad for you. So you split. It’s hard, and you really miss them, sometimes so much it makes you angry and crazy. 

You think of them often, sometimes wanna go back...



But then the image of them viciously stabbing a puppy is a pretty good deterrent. 

Anyway, I quit for a year the other day. 

Yeehaw.

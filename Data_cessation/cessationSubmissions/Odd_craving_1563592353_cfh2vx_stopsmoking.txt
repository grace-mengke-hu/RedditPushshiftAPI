Non-smoker here to show some respect.

I recently had a heart transplant. Before my transplant I spent a year on an artificial heart. So I’ve seen the inside of just about every doctor’s office in the state of Massachusetts. 

During my journey, I must have been asked several thousand times if I was a smoker, or if I had ever been a smoker. I had the luxury of saying “no”, but every time I answered this question, I thought about my family members, friends, and coworkers who would have to answer “yes”. 

You see, if those people ever had to face a health situation like mine, they couldn’t get the same care as I did. Smoking clouds everything. Blood work, x-rays, blood flow, internal heart pressures, blood pressure, and a million things that doctors don’t even talk about. Smokers receive different health care from non-smokers because of this reality. Doctors have no choice, they have to treat smokers differently. 

I see the bravery and courage displayed on this sub, and it touches me. I know what’s in the back of all your minds. You’re afraid of the damage smoking can do and you and your fucking changing it! Take it from me, you don’t want to be a smoker looking at a serious illness, you don’t want to be a smoker looking at an organ transplant. You don’t want to be a smoker with pre-diabetes. Even routine surgery can bring in crazy complications if your a smoker. You can do this!!

AMA about heart transplants or artificial hearts. I know way too much about all of this.

New year's eve quitters - how you doing?

My cravings have weirdly come back in a big way the last few days. But they just remind me that I used to feel like that *all the time* when I still smoked. I'm excited about hitting 31 days quit very soon. And about spending all the money I've saved. How's everyone else getting on?

Struggling.

I went to my local convenient store and bought a pack. After walking around finding a nice place to smoke, I found myself at the lake. I looked at the pack for a long while and then pulled one out. I stuck it in my mouth, sitting there for at least twenty minutes. After some long thinking, I took it out and threw that whole damn pack into the water! Day 5!

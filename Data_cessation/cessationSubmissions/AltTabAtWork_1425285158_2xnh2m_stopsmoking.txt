Some honest words after being a non smoker

I've stopped smoking 50 days ago.
It was a firm decision to stop. It was during the evening after lunch. I smoked and thought about the future. Do i really want to be that dependent on cigarettes? Do i have to go for a smoke when my first child is born? Do i really want to be at my childs graduation day and thinking about a smoke?

I said NO! I grabbed my tobacco, my papers and lighter and just threw it in the trash and started to not smoke anymore.

I can't  really say that my life changed . I just don't smoke anymore. It's not like you will get Superman when you stop. It was your low self-esteem you did start to smoke in the first place. You were weak and couldn't say no. Maybe it's just me. Maybe i can't see the changes because i'm now used to not smoke anymore.

One thing i can say is, that **i am in control of my life**. I managed to fight an addicting just by having the will to stop. And i'm proud that smoking is not holding me down anymore. I am a young man without restrictions in my life

Do you have the will to stop? Are you in charge of your life?

**Tl;dr: You will not turn to a Super Hero when you stop but you will prove that you're in control of your life.**

Well the time has finally come. Advice needed.

So I've been cutting back for a while (and even switched to a vape  exclusively for a few months). But on New Years my vape broke and I stupidly (and drunkenly) bought a pack. Well now the pack is almost gone and I'll be dammed if I buy another one.


 Since I'm trying to get in shape my idea was to try and do a quick workout when the craving gets bad (short run, push-ups, ect.). That way it will release endorphins and hopefully take my mind off it. Those of you that have quit or are quiting have you tried something like that before?

Heres to my last day of being a smoker.

I said that Allan Carr wasn't working for me. I was wrong.

After posting here that the easyway method wasn't working for me, some of you tried to convince me that I read the book again. So, I did. I've dedicated last two days on reading the book, and I'm happy I did. I can now proudly say: I'm not a smoker anymore!

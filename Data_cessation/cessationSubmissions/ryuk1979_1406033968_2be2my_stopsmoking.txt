Need some help convincing to quit, just want some advice.

Edited to make my question clearer:

I guess my main question is can you enjoy smoking in moderation? I ask probably because I'm yet to see bad effects from the amount I smoke at the moment. I usually only smoke on the weekends and maybe one or two throughout the week. I don't really want to give up yet even though I know I should, especially now that I can't drink without wanting a cigarette. Will that urge go away if I quit, like will I be able to drink without wanting a cigarette? I guess does this sounds like the early days of addiction and that it'll only go downhill from here and that I should stop now?

It's time.

So about two years ago after a huge bout of depression I picked up the habit. I've decided it's time to quit. A former smoker at work said I should wait till Saturday to make it my first day since I'm off Sunday and the second day is the hardest for withdrawals. It's three AM on Saturday and I'm already feeling bad. I've eaten everything in the house and about killed the battery in my e-cig in the course of an hour. I have no cigarettes left but I find myself already having cravings and wanting to head out to the gas station. How did you guys get through the first night?

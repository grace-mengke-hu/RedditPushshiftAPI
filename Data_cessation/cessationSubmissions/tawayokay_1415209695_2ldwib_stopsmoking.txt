First time in a long time I'm trying to quit, this seems like it's going to be incredibly hard...

I have cigrx mints and they do kind of help, but yesterday when I tried to quit and didn't smoke for 16 hours straight I started sweating/getting goose bumps/chills and when I finally did smoke I had a feeling exactly like I just took 5 xanax, I must be really addicted.. but anyways I've had 4 cigarettes in the last ~48 hours and when I was smoking normally I was up to a pack+ a day. If anyone wants to share their experience/tips whatever leave a comment.

80hrs and over the hump

Hey guys, just checking in at 80hrs post-quitting. I've been lurking for the last two weeks while I worked up the courage to quit and pretty heavily reading posts for the last few days (for obvious reasons). 
I just wanted to let people know who are in the 1-72hr range that it gets so much easier if you can just stick it out. Below is the mantra that helped me get through the first few days and maybe it can help someone else.

It's shitty right now, I know. It is painful emotionally and physically and you feel pretty defeated. But you haven't smoked yet! You've endured so much that at this point why would you want to light up? You would just have to experience this all over again the next time you worked up the courage to quit. You can do this. Just sit tight. Freedom is around the corner.

Good luck all! I believe in you!

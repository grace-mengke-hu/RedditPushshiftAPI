Day 2 after 12 years

Not bad. Started reading Allen Carr today, and it has brought on a sense of confidence. I went through a really rough break up 6 weeks ago and relapsed after a week. I went no contact, and now I feel that I have reached that point where I am thinking about and starting to improve myself. I plan on coming here a lot. Day 2 of the rest of my life.

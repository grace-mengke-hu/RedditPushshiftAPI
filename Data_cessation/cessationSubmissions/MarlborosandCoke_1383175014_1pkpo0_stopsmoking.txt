How should I prepare myself to quit?

I'm undergoing oral surgery on December 11th, and due to the risk of infection and dislodging the blood clot that'll be filling the removed tooth cavities, I won't be able to dip or smoke for at least a week. I see this as an opportunity to quit my usage altogether. In your experience, how do you recommend I proceed in the next month and a half to make this transition as easy as possible? I've struggled with quitting cold turkey before, and I really don't want to struggle with the anxiety and depression that accompanies withdrawals alongside any post-operation pain and discomfort. Thanks in advance!

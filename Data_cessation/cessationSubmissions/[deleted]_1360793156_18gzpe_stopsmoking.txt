I had another relapse..

Hey reddit,
I just went out to buy some groceries at my local convience store and out of pure habit I bought a pack of cigarettes.

I thought it wasn't a big deal because I had quit for over 2 months now. 10 minutes ago I had a very strong craving and a voice in my head just screamed :"Smoke a cigarette NOW!" and I gave in too that craving... 

Needless to say I feel like a weak-willed piece of shit right now and I wish I hadn't smoked that cigarette. I don't know what I should do right now...

I could really use some advice...

Finally don't feel the need to smoke

After trying to give up for the best two years I finally don't feel the need to smoke! Iv been attempting cold turkey and i would get past the first few days and just give in. I used Allen carrs method that actually worked but found myself back to old ways.  I decided to
 try patches and i was really sceptical
 but they have worked so far, I'm on day ten and i feel great. I guess different things work for different people :) so happy I can finally breathe!

Edit how do you set a badge?

Been about 4 months now...these cravings are hitting me with all they’ve got.

I gave up almost 4 months ago and I’m so happy I did. I was an on and off smoker for about 3 years, the most previous year was my most consistent. Whenever I think about pulling on a cigarette, it almost makes me cringe. Just to know I’m putting something disgusting in my lungs is making me shudder. But lately my cravings have been so strong! I think it has something to do with the change in the weather. Worst part about this is that I live in a fairly busy city and so many people smoke where I walk. Exercising helps my cravings but that’s about it. Anyone got any tips?

Quit smoking over a year ago, by switching to vaping. Now, time to quit that too.

And I'm super nervous. Gonna go cold turkey and just get it over with. Luckily i can sleep through the next few days to get through the withdrawals. Never going back to cigs, and throwing out all my vape gear so I'm not tempted to go back. Ughhh here we go!

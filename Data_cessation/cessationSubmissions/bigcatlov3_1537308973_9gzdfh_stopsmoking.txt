Went out last night...

I had a small relapse and took a puff of a cig. I dont feel like I want them again nor am I trying to convince myself to go buy a pack. Did I just reset all of my progress that I have made? I am 17 days quit. I feel guilty but I am still confident and I am just not going to drink again because I feel like that is the only reason this happened. So how much damage did I do?

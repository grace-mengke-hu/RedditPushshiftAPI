Hello all!!! I originally quit on the 18th of August but have been cheating the whole way through...whenever I was alone I would smoke maybe a half of a cig and when my now ex went out of town I bought a pack..now I’m two days clean..honestly and I want a smoke...brain keep telling me just one for the day won’t hurt...how do I over come this so early in the game??

I would like to talk to you about my hookah addiction.

Hello /r/stopsmoking.

I started smoking hookah 5 years ago. 2 years ago I moved into my own apartment and got my own pot, thought I'd still smoke occasionally like I did before. Wrong. Because it was so accessible and cheap now I started smoking more often, and a year ago it got to a point where I smoked everyday. It became a crippling addiction.

It grew into a daily ritual where I would fire it up, and then watch tv, play games or browse the internet. Multiple bowls on the weekend. In fact I smoked my last bowl 30 minutes before making this post. I often skipped meals because I would smoke hookah and it would make me feel good and also kill my appetite.

But 30 minutes ago, after finishing up, I did not clean the bowl. Put it in a trash bag, along with all my coals, all my shisha and all accessories related to it, and threw the bag into a compactor. I've never touched a cigarette in my life, but I had just the same addiction. It killed my hobbies and my appetite, and all I wanted to do after I got home was to smoke a bowl.

Today starts the first day of me going smoke free. I know it is going to be hard and I know no matter how much I try to willpower myself through it there will be impulses to get online and order another set. But I will try, I will talk to people close to me (and this sub :) ) whenever I get the impulses, and I hope I will remain smoke free for the rest of my life.

I will regain my health and my hobbies. My journey starts today. Just thought I should share it here. Cheers.

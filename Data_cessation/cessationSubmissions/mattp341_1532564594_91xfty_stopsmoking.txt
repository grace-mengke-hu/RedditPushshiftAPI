Please scare me.

I am 21, I smoke cigarettes and black and milds. I am not your typical smoker, I probably smoke 1 or 2 cigarettes/b&amp;m's a day. I know that doesn't classify me as a "smoker", but I feel the cravings and give into them almost every day. I fear that even though I am not smoking a pack a day, I am slowly killing myself. I can tell that my lung capacity isn't what it could be, I know that I feel less healthy than I could be. I have been smoking for around 2-3 years now and I just don't see a logical end game for this. There's nothing to be gained. I really just need motivation to stop before it gets REALLY bad. I want to be terrified and scared of smoking so that I won't want to continue this nasty habit. Please help me.

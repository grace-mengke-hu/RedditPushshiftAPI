Does anyone feel like quitting their caffeine addiction while they're at it?

I only drink about 2-3 cups a day, which I feel is an average amount of caffeine consumption. However, if I *don't* have those 2-3 cups by nine in the morning EVERY MORNING I get the *worst* headache, migraine, sometimes I even throw up. It's quite obviously a physical addiction.

Has anyone on here quit drinking coffee/tea, or cut back to the point they can go 24 hours without a cup? How did it go?

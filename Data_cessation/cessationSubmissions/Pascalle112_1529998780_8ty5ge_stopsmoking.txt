Anyone had experience with medication increasing cravings and smoking?

Hi All, 

Short term lurker, first time poster, quit date set for 6 July 2018. 

I’ve started new medication to fix my sleep disorder and it’s working! 

The downside is it has more than doubled my smoking.  
I’ve gone from 6 packets of 30’s in a fortnight to 15 packets of 30’s in a fortnight. 

A quick Google search shows I’m not the only one who has experienced this but no one shared how they fought it and quit. 

I’m committed to quitting, I want to, I need to and it has to be done. I just have no idea how to tackle this super craving? 

Changing my sleep medication is not an option I want to go for. I’m on the lowest dose, it’s working without the usual side effects and my Drs are happy with my progress. 

Thank you for reading, any help/suggestion will be appreciated.

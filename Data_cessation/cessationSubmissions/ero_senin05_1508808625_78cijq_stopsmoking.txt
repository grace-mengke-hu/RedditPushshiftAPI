Almost fell off the wagon

I've conquered 11 days and got so close to falling off the wagon. I was cleaning out the car and found an empty packet under the seat. Out of habit I gave the pack a shake and thought I felt something move inside. 

A second shake proved I was imagining things but at that moment I realised how likely it would be that I'd have smoked that cigarette had it have actually been there. I'd like to think I would have just thrown it in the bin with everything else but I don't think it would have happened if I'm being honest. 

This weekend was a tough one. I had to look after my 4 year old and his 6 year old cousin by myself and they always go between being best friends to hating eachother every 5 seconds. I guess it's normal for kids but that doesn't make it any easier. There was at least 2 times when I just thought a smoke would be just the thing to ease the stress.

In other news, the coughing has started. It's not so bad so far and I'm taking early action this time around to hopefully speed the recovery time. Plenty of water and I've cranked up the humidifier setting on my cpap machine.

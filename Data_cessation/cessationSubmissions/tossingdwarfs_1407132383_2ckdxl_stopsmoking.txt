Discovering my triggers...

Today was a good day, didn't light up! I'm starting to notice the 'worst' moments for me during the day are after I have a meal... I've been going for walks after I eat if possible, being outside helps to calm the crave (for me)... What are some of your trigger moments, and how do you guys deal?

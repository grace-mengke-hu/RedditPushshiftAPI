Day 3 -- Constipation

I just quit smoking May 1st. 

I haven't had a satisfactory bowel movement since then. 

I thought I was prepared; I've been eating high fibre foods, drinking lots of water, sucking on sugar-free candy that should have a laxative effect...yet, still nothing other than cramps/feeling bloated. :( 

Advice? Should I take a laxative or should I just wait it out?

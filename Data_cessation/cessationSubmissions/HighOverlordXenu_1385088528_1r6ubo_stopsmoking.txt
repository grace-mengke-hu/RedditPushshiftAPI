Girlfriend at 48 hour mark; nothing tastes right and uncontrollable muscle twitching.

My girlfriend just quit smoking two days ago after more than twenty years. She quit cold turkey (patches and gum don't seem to agree with her), but lately her symptoms just seem to be getting worse and worse. I'm trying to keep her hydrated, but everything is apparently tasting bitter to her (I thought taste and smell were supposed to be improving at this point?)

Also, she seems to be suffering from severe muscle twitches, making sleep very difficult.

How long can we expect these symptoms to last, and is there any way to mitigate them? I fear she's starting to fall off the wagon.

So pissed off today!

I haven't really had a bad day during my quit until today.  Even previous attempts haven't seen a foul mood like this one I'm experiencing.  Not sure what set it off, or if it's even related to not smoking.  I would just go home and wallow in my own misery, but I am saving my time off to cash in for holiday gifts.  My coworkers are pretty tolerant & understanding anyways.  I just want to finish my work quietly and not be bothered.  No new business today!

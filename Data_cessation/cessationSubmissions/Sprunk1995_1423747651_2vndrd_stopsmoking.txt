"Social" smoking, is it okay ?

I often go to caf√©s with friends, and i really like having 3 to 4 cigs with my coffee, i also like associating cigarettes with beer. Is it okay to smoke only on occasions like that?

I'm not smoking cause of "peer pressure", but i do like to feel like i'm "into" the group as all my friends are smokers. I don't exceed 6 to 7 cigs per day...

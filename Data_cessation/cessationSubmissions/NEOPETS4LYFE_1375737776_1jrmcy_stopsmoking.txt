Feeling a little desperate for support

You have no idea how pathetic I feel for posting this, but I don't really have anywhere else to go...

I'm only 3 days in (15-30 cigs a day for the last 15 years) and today was just awful. You all know.

The problem is that I don't want to tell anyone that I quit, yet. The reason (and it's silly) is that I'm afraid that I'll "jinx" it somehow, and I don't want to experience the humiliation of failing. Again.
 
My husband knows, but he isn't very supportive truth be told - I'm pretty sure he thinks I'll fail this time as well so he doesn't really care.

So Reddit, do you have some Internet support for me? It really would help and motivate me.

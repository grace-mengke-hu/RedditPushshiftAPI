Quit date for Monday, the 2nd.. telling people?

Hey guys, 

First posting here. I am quitting cold turkey method on Monday and could use your support.

I need to tell my friends and family that I am quitting... including my boyfriend who is a heavy smoker. This is the first time I have ever considered quitting, but I am going to on Monday. How will this affect my friends and family, most of whom are smokers?

I am in it for my own reasons and I am aware that other people should be happy for me, but what is realistic?

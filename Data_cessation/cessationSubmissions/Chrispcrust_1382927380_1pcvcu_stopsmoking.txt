Skin Improvements over time (dark eye circles)

Hey all,

I'm a 27 year old male, picked up smoking when I was 15 years old, smoked about 15 a day for 10 years straight until I was 25. I've been an on and off smoker for the last 2 years.  I've also been a pretty heavy pot smoker for chunks of time as well. I have only ever drank on weekends, and not every weekend at that. 

I've just recently (in the past year) developed some pretty bad dark circles under my eyes. About 8 months ago, I quit for about 6 weeks, and didn't notice much improvement in my eyes. I relapsed up until about 3 weeks ago. Been clean for 21 days, hoping this time is "for real". 

I know that under eyes is one of the first areas to show age. But the rest of my skin looks very young for a 27 year old despite the smoking. So the dark circles are really sticking out on my face. I know from my previous quit that 6 weeks didn't do much for the eyes. Still that annoying black skin tone, circles and bags under the eyes. Almost looks like I got punched in the face under the right lighting. 

When I was 25 I was quit for about 9 months and I looked at a pic from back then and I looked great, no circles. But I had never developed them at that point. I feel like the last 2 years has really done some damage to me. 

Even in this 3 weeks, I've gained weight (I was under weight) , my skin is so much more bright and colorful, and my teeth are great. But the circles are just bothering me. 

Has anyone experienced having these circles and seeing them diminish over the course of 9 months to a year? I am hoping this is somewhat reversible (I know I'm not super young any more), and that given enough time with a healthy diet and workout lifestyle that things will improve under my eyes. 

I've been using creams every day. I know it sounds vain but the outer shell is definetely reflective of whats going on inside. Thanks for your feedback!

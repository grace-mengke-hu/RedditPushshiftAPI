Well, I am finally doing it.

I have read Alan Carr's book a couple times in pieces and I just never could seem to stay with it. This time, I have been listening to it as an audiobook in my car during commutes and it has really sunk in. I'm done. I threw away the rest of my pack. I have 100% confidence and I am not looking back. It has been about 5 hours now since I have had a smoke and it feels different this time, like I have truly accepted it. I look forward to watching my badge climb and cheering for others as we do this!

I started 2019 thinking Marlboro Ice was the tasty little pleasures in life, now I fucking hate them. Yay!

I don’t have friends to talk about this to, so I came to this sub instead. Around mid January I decided to stop smoking these cancer sticks but I didn’t finish my pack and I didn’t want to throw them away (shits not cheap) so I kept it at the back of my drawer. I’m ashamed to admit this but I did have some help from a pod/vape thing, something like a Juul. Today I kind of felt like having a cig to see how’d it taste like again, I fucking hated every minute of it, even right now my throat feels uncomfortable. It’ll take me a while for my throat to feel itself again but damn, that pack is going to the bin. 

I hate it and I hope to remember how much I hate it right now so I won’t smoke a cig ever again. I really do feel like I’ve achieved something, and I’m kinda happy. 

I’m an occasional weed smoker so I’m not sure how my lungs are gonna handle that? But we’ll see. 

Good luck everyone! 
Next stop, limiting the use of my e-cig.

Need tips for anxiety and stress relief

So I only smoke one cigarette a day or two to three if my day has been really bad but I'd really like to stop. I have one every night with some wine or other alcohol because my tension just builds throughout the day and it helps. I have a two month old and I'd just really like to not have this habit anymore. I can't count how many times I've said I'm done only to cave and run to a 7-11 at three in the morning. 
What really works for you guys to help with anxiety and stress to replace how calming nicotine can be?

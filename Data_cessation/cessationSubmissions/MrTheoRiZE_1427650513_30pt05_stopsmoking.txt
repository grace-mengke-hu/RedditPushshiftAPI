I picked a quit date after 8 years.

I've decided to take a stand against my addiction once and for all. I've tried to quit many times but triggers just drive me right back to it. Over the next month I'll be setting up the conditions to quit on May 3rd. I will be getting a lower stress job (currently a cook at a restaurant), this super hard semester will be over, and I'll be getting my own place without a roommate. I'll also be changing my diet to a more natural whole food diet. I'm going to do this. I want to do this. Smoking hasn't shown to be tangibly affecting me until recently (short breathe, strange chest/body sensations) so I've decided it's now or never.

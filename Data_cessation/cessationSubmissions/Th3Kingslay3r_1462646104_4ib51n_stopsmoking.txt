365 Glorious Smoke Free Days! You can do it!

Hard to believe it has been exactly a year since I quit smoking cigarettes and I can't be happier. I thought it would be impossible but after just 72 hours the cravings stopped being bad and before I knew it my sense of smell became stronger, food had a better taste and I don't smell awful anymore! If I can do it ANYONE CAN QUIT!

Where to leave my E Cigarette?

I've been trying to quit vaping for a long time now. At first I started throwing my E cigarettes away like you would with a pack of cigarettes. But, I've tried so many times now that it's getting expensive and I'm tired of forking out the money for another one. For a while now I've been leaving it with a friend who vapes. Currently I live with her as a roommate now, so it's not as easy. I've tried letting her use my current one, but even a craving is the only thing that stops me from asking for it back.

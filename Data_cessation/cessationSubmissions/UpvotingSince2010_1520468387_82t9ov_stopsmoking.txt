Please don't be stupid like me.

I was able to get down to 0 nic on my ecig three weeks ago and it was flawlessly easy after seven months to get down from 15mg to 0mg. Despite my being free from nic, the vaping was still an ingrained habit.  

A little over a week ago, I ran out of juice early in the AM at work and the only vape shop near my work is SUPPPER slow and it takes half an hour to get a bottle of juice. (It's a mix your own place and they only sell their own brand of mods so people take forever to get checked out). 

To save myself the hastle, I just asked one of my fellow vaping coworkers for some juice. He didn't know what mg nic he vaped and just told me "it's .8". I was like "okay, .8 nic juice, that's really specific." Turns out he doesn't know anything about his own vaping habit and he was telling me his mod was a subohm. *Eyeroll*

That juice was minimum 18mg. Maybe more. 

I got a nicotine high like you wouldn't believe. I could go into detail but I don't want to make anyone feel tempted so I'm just gonna say IT WAS A MISTAKE. 

He told me he didn't like the flavor and just to keep the bottle. I vaped the whole bottle. After it was done I was like, okay, time to go back to 0mg. Fucking hell it was like going straight back to square one. Impossible and grumpy and just generally overwhelmed at work for no reason. 

I'm not going back to 15mg but I have to reset in a sense to 6mg because I got myself hooked again. Took three months to go from 6 to 0. So much hard worked ruined. 

Don't be stupid. Keep your stock in stock and don't indulge.

Down to 10 a day!

I had been smoking a pack a day, but for the past 5 weeks I’ve been cutting back in increments and now I’m down to 10/day and I’m feeling awesome! I know I’ve got a long way to go, but I’m feeling proud of myself and I thought I’d share. My next goal is to cut down to 8/day by next Friday. Wish me luck! :)

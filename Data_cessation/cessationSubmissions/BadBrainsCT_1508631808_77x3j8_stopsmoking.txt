The Prankster God is Real

I've traveled monthly for work for over 5 years. This means airports were my enemy.. rushing outside to grab a smoke on a layover, or taking trams to other terminals to visit the hideous smoking "lounge" two terminals away. I've been smoke free for over 2 months.. and this is what I encountered yesterday. The fucking smoking tank 5 feet from my boarding gate. In 5 years, this never happened. Quit for two months, and convenience is served on a platter. Fucking prankster god. Stay strong folks, it's worth it.

Passed my one year mark

Feels nice to have reached this milestone. I haven't looked back in quite some time, but it was not always that day.

I remember the first day I quit smoking I had a long day of work (12 hours). I was really excited to head home and relax, making it through my first full day of not smoking. I'm driving on the highway and ..."pop!"... flat tire. I pulled over and up into a gas station. Southern summer heat bearing down on me. Sweating profusely. I started laughing. 

In Allen Carr's book he talks a lot about cigarettes as an illusory clutch. You think the cigarette make you happier (for at least a second), but really it is slowly deepening your addiction and crippling you. The tiny -- and eventually non-existent -- moment of peace or calm the cigarette gives you is an illusion. I tricked myself into thinking it somehow made bad situations less bad.

There was nothing more in the world that I wanted than a cigarette. Sure, I quit with some conviction the night before, but it had only been about half a day. I had excused myself for one cigarette (or one more pack) about a dozen times before this for less annoying situations. Hell, all I had to do was walk into the gas station.

I took a deep breath in shaking my head, sighed, and started laughing out loud. I laughed because in that moment I realized I was *finally* going to quit smoking cigarettes. I thought to myself, "a cigarette ain't gonna fix this tire any quicker".

I changed the tire with a smile on my face the whole time. 

It was a good day.

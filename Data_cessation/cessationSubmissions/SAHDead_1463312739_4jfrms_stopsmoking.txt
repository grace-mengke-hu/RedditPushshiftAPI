For Narnia! [introduction post]

Put out my last smoke at 10PM yesterday (05/14). I have lozenges to help with nicotine withdrawal, and just used my first one 7:30AM (05/15). My main motivation is family. 2nd is my psychiatrist thinks I might have COPD because my anti-anxiety med makes me lose my breath. Seeing regular doctor tomorrow (05/16) about high blood pressure and going to ask about lungs being destroyed past hope. I have smoked since I was 16, I am 33 now. It's messed up, the reason I started. At 16 a doctor told me that if I started smoking I would be dead by the time I was 18. Started pretty much the next day. They said I was "going through a phase" whenever I mentioned my depression mixed with hyper activity and strong bouts of anxiety. Whatever, I wanted to die when I was younger. Now I have 2 reasons to live, 3 counting my wife.

So I'm just wondering, because Googling isn't helping much, how long it takes for all the OTHER chemicals from tobacco to leave your system. I'll keep the nicotine around for a bit with lozenges, but I worry about the other chemicals. Hopefully this quitting time is my last. It has a third really strong motivator, money. I have no money to buy the evil sticks of death for another week. Hoping I can maintain on the lozenges and not return once money comes back into my possession. Anyway, name's Chris. Look forward to the journey with you all.

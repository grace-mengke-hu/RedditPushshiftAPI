Well, here goes nothing.

Ive been subscribed to this subreddit for a few months now. It has never left my mind that I NEED to quit these death sticks.  My friend has just quit and she seems to be doing quite well. So goes the old saying, "if they can do it, so can I". Everyone is different but what tactics have you guys/gals used that made the transition a little easier?
Toothpicks, gum etc.

When will the phlegm end?

As my badge says, I just passed the three-month mark. I'm pretty much done with symptoms of withdrawal and I haven't had craving in a while, but there's one thing that has only gotten worse.

PHLEGM.

These last few weeks have been miserable as far as mucus in the back of my throat. 

I know my lungs are cleaning themselves out, and I understand that this is healthy and to be expected, but WOW it's worse than I thought it would be. 

Anyone have an idea when I should expect this to start clearing out?

I've stopped, but here is my healthy smoker's dilemma.

Long time lurker here. Quit cold turkey on July 1st using Carr's EASYWAY. One of biggest problems when quitting is i never showed symptoms of suffering from any of the side effects of smoking. I'm extremely healthy in all other aspects of my life. I work out 5-6 days a week, I weigh my good and count my calories, I can deadlift 505lbs and run 3 miles with ease. I rarely drink. But that filthy cigarette had me in its death grip. But I never had smokers cough, never felt tired, or out of breathe. And I think that's what made it hard to quit before reading the book. I would go a few days without smoking and no physical attributes would change. I know I better off not smoking and plan to stick with it , but anyone else in the same boat as me? Otherwise a health nut ,except the fact I've been smoking for over a decade.

"Quit" using a vape, addicted to vape now.

I quit a couple of years ago using an e cigarette (typical box mod, tank setup). I didn't think much of my continued vaping because I did it slightly less, didn't smell, and it was cheaper (woohoo eBay). Unfortunately I realized I'm pretty much addicted in the same way now, with similar withdrawal symptoms to when I quit smoking (I had the withdrawal symptoms from quitting cigarettes even while I was using the vape at first, but those are gone). 

I'm on 6mg now but have tried stepping down to 3mg. That just ends up with me having to vape more to feel satisfied.

6ish Weeks Post Cold Turkey and SO Tired

I'm 6 weeks into a cold turkey quit. From a +-20 year, pack a day smoker to being so happy NOT smoking that I've lost count of how long exactly it's been .. might be 6.5 weeks, could be 7, maybe it's 5.5. I'm not sure. I don't miss it at all. Except .. 

I am soooo tired and just really not sleeping well. It's 5:30PM and I'm so exhausted that I'm sure I could go to bed now and sleep all night - if only I could fall asleep.  I fall asleep really late, wake up early and typically get up once or twice a night. I'd guess I'm getting about 5.5 hours of sleep on a good night. This from a solid 8.5+ before I quit. I suppose it could be some underlying health issue, but I wasn't having issues with fatigue or poor sleep prior to quitting and onset was around Quit Day 4. 

There are days that I've considered starting again just to dispel the exhaustion.  It's dumb and obviously counterproductive, but I expected this feeling of refreshment and perkiness that has yet to come. Anyone go through the same thing long term and come out the other side well rested and smoke free?

Just relapsed day 2

Quit on the first, juul to be exact as I used it as a replacement since October. My girlfriend of 4 years broke up with me today the second. I just couldn’t do it. I have the app I have Allen carr’s book. I changed my quit date to the 5th I’m just out of sorts. 

I don’t know, I guess I’m posting this as a validation. I know I can do this but I wasn’t ready to compound troubles. I’ll be back.

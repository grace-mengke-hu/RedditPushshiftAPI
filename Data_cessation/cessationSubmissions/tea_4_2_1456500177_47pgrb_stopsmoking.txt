A milestone today

Four weeks ago, I sat in front of a mirror and watched myself smoke my last one. I wanted to remember it. As I watched myself, it looked pretty silly and I laughed about it. It hasn't been easy but everyday it is getting better. A 40 year addiction doesn't fade away so easily. I have only quit once before, for 5 days, and I just had to try "one". It was a huge rush and it also lead to ten more years of smoking. Lesson learned. I am fading with an NRT, vaping, so that by the end of next month I will be free of all the remnants of my smoking years. Even with an NRT, quitting is tough. 

I like how much better I feel. My sinuses aren't perpetually plugged up, my sense of smell and taste have returned, I am sleeping so much better, breathing the cold air outside feels good, my clothes and body don't stink, the tightness in my chest has gone away. I have saved $160 by not smoking that I will spend on something that will bring me happiness.

In a couple of days, the 4 week badge gets replaced with a one month star. Statistically, I have now reached the point where I am five times more likely to have a successful quit.

Keep up the good fight fellow quitters, we are going to make it!

23 years old, time to stop. Need a few pointers.

I need these out of my life, but my friends need to go with it. I'm 23, steady job and financially secure and due to recent health events, its time i quit smoking. 
I am confident i can cut the habit during work hours, (where i can smoke any time i want) but what I'm not sure of is the social habits. 
Literally all my friends smoke (and drink,huge trigger for me, but i'm personally not a big drinker.), it may not be a big group, but hey, it's my friends. I would need to cut nearly all social ties with them to be successful in getting rid of this addiction.
tl;dr: i need advice on abandoning social ties with old friends/only friends to quit smoking.

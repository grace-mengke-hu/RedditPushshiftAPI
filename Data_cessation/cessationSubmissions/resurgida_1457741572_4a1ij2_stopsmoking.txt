Second day smoke free... and I can already see the benefits of quitting.

I have been smoking about 20/30 cigs a day for the last 5 years or so. Two days ago I decided to stop smoking with the help of nicotine pills, and I couldn't be happier! The nicotine dose I am taking is very low - but it's there, so I'm not THAT moody. I've tried quitting cold turkey before but I never made it.


This time I am super determined to quit. I already see some little changes. My skin looks and feels much better, I can smell a lot of subtle things I couldn't before... this is crazy. I'm convinced now, tobacco isn't just toxic, it's pure and evil **poison**.

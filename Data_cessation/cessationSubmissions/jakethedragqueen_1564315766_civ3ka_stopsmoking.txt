gave in but not losing hope

just here to dump some thoughts. went a whole week without smoking but the stresses of my life led me to drive to sheetz and buy a pack. feel like shit about it, but I’m not gonna be too hard on myself about it. what do y’all do when you’re triggered? any tips of things I can do to distract myself? it’s gotten to the point where there are a lot of big inconveniences in my life that can’t be avoided at the moment, so what can I do instead of smoking when these instances trigger me to smoke?

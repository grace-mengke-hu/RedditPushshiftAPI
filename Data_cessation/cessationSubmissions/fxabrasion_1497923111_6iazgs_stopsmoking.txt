Dealing with all triggers but one..

So I have been smoking for close to 20 years now and tried quitting every way imaginable (nicotine replacement, cold turkey, chantax, zyban... my  triggers i have overcome include others smoking, driving, coffee drinking, and stress... the only trigger i have a problem with is drinking alcohol.. after two beers or a mixed drink its over, off to grab a pack.. So i use nicotine lozenges about 75% of the time.. Ive been told not to drink, which is logical, but not realistic. Has anyone had this issue and be able to have a couple drinks and NOT smoke? Oh and I drink typically on the weekend, but not every weekend.

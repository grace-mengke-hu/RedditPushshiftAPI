Blech! That SMELL!

Just had students turn in final papers for the semester. One student is clearly a smoker because her paper STINKS! Seriously, the odor coming off the pages she handed in is like a really, really bad stale ashtray.  It's SO mortifying to think my stuff used to smell like that, too. How on earth did I ever think I was getting away with people not knowing I smoked? Gross. Thank goodness that's all behind me now!

Let the adventure begin, tomorrow

When I started smoking ten years ago (damn fifteen year old me) I set tomorrow as the official ‘never touch a cigarette again’ date because no way was I going to smoke past ten years, I mean, that’s a lot of time to be a smoker.... well now it doesn’t seem like a lot of time and it’s here. The past week I’ve been in an anxious (kind of depressed) state which sounds stupid cause it’s just a cigarette, right? No. Feels like I’m losing a quality, a shitty one, but something that’s given me comfort in those crazy times in life. Last time I tried quitting I used patches but that didn’t work, same with the gum. So this round will be cold turkey and lots of exercise. Any advice or something you’ve done to kick the cravings?

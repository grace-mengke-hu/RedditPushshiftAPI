First hour

I just put on my first patch an hour ago! I thought I'd hang around this sub reddit for motivation. I started smoking when I was 17 (I'm 21 now) and I had about 15 a day (more if I'm drinking). I've tried to quit 3 or 4 times now but I've never used patches before. I've heard some people can have some pretty messed up dreams with them, has that happened to anyone here? Should I take it off when I go to sleep?
Thanks :)
Also, I can't wait to get fit again!

Edit: thanks everyone :) I slept with it on and didn't have bad dreams. Yay! I also plan on cutting down the dosage of patches until I don't need them at all. I know from my past attempts, though, that I need some sort of aid to help me quit. This is the first thing that isn't giving me a craving so I'm pretty excited!

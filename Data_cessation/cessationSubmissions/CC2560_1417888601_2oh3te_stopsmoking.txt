Tips for avoiding smoking when out drinking?

I'm on day 5. Everything has been going great, but last night I went out for some drinks. At a point I was hellbent on having a cigarette. Fortunately a very kind acquaintance stood outside in the rain with me for 30 minutes and talked me out of doing it, but I won't always be so lucky to have people who are so caring in my presence.

Here's the thing - I like going out and drinking. I don't want to be a non-drinker. I want to be a non smoker. Gum and coffee work throughout the day to distract me from cravings, but when I'm out drinking I feel like it's a whole different game.

Any tips?

Did I relapse?

I stopped smoking on May 11 (May 10 was my last cigarette). I know that drinking is the hardest thing for me when I quit because of how much I just want to smoke and not care anymore. However, this time around I've been drinking and consciously not smoking and it's been working. I was really worried about camping with friends this weekend. My friend rolled a couple of spliffs which I smoked. Wondering what the implications will be in terms of healing and quitting, etc.

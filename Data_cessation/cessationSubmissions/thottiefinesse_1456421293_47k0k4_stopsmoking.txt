How to quit when using a vaporizer?

Anyone here experienced this? I quit smoking cigarettes about a year ago. Since then, I have had about 5 total, and switched full time to a vaporizer. I think it's time to kick that too, but it's really difficult for me, maybe more so than giving up cigarettes. 



I use my vaporizer everywhere, and do not monitor how many drags I take, or how frequently I take them. Starting this week I have eliminated taking habitual drags at work, and am trying to only do it when I really need/want it.


Any suggestions? I think the constant vaping is starting to affect my health. (blood pressure, breathing)

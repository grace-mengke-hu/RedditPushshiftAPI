2 days! Me and wife.

My wife and I have been heavy smokers by our standards for years. We have quit multiple times, sometimes for a month, but we always go back. A lot of this was temptation because we worked in the service industry and a lot of people tend to smoke. 

Now most of the people that we are surrounded with do not smoke. 2 days ago we made a promise that we would quit and we are going to start working out and living healthier lives for ourselves and our newborn daughter.

What is a good way to celebrate 1 year without cigarettes?

Hi reddit! My mom is coming up on one year cigarette free. I can't even begin to describe how happy I am for her, and how proud the whole family is! She smoked for over 40 years, and quit cold turkey and never looked back. Anyway, I want to make a point of celebrating her one year anniversary because I know she worked so hard and I want her to know how happy we all are so she continues to be smoke free with our support. Do you have any ideas?

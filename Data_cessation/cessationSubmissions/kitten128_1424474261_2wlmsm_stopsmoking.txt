snowstorm this weekend

and went out to get all the milk, TP and bread and filled up my gas tank. OMG was the feeling to buy a carton of smokes so strong, because I don't drive in crap weather and OMG I will be stuck if I don't buy them now!!!!!!!!! So instead of the $65 for a carton I would have spent, I bought myself several magazines, some more super dark chocolate, a few fancy refrigerated coffee drinks, a couple puzzle book and some different gums, mints and some red vines. I know I'm not really saving any of the money I would have spent on smoking right now, but it was nice to do something for myself and things that will help keep me busy whilst being snowed in with 3 children!

I am not being over confident, but I feel like I have a decent handle on it this time around. And it feels better than the headache, the irritability and the cravings.

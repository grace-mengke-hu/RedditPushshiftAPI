A journey to enlightenment - 100 days smoke free & 2 months weed free.

I'll keep this as short as I can. I probably won't though, haha.  The past 100 days have been a roller coaster - physically, emotionally, and mentally. My rock bottom was last year, a week before christmas. I had purchased 1 gram of pure MDMA and snorted it alone all night during the festive time. This brought me to the depths of hell which is depression and anxiety for the next few months - which I had temporarily masked with a plethora of different things: cigarettes, weed, and an unhealthy lifestyle of eating.

100 days ago, I began with quitting cigarettes. That then lead into quitting cannabis. One after the other, I continued to quit all these things that were harming me. I surprised myself with what I could do to benefit my health. I treated my own body with respect and in turn it has turned around my mental health 180 degrees.

I have managed to quit the following:

- Cigarettes 
- Caffeine
- Cannabis
- Amphetamines
- Processed sugar & sweeteners
- Meat

I'm now a week into my plant based diet and am quite excited about my gains at the gym.

This sub is life changing! As one of my friends once said, cliche's exist for a reason (because they are true) - if I can push myself to make this change(s), you can too. As I've said in my posts early in the journey, you need to remember two things - short term pain for long term gain & what you feel is temporary, it will pass in time. Time heals.

Thank you for listening if you made it this far.

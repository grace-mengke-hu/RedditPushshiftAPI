I quit smoking (been 2 months) but had a cigar yesterday

So after several failed attempts, I finally managed to quit cigarettes and have dealt with cravings very well and i am very confident that I will stay quit this time.  I am done.  However, just the way the night turned out yesterday, I ended up having a full cigar.  Although I am positive I will not go back to smoking and this slip means nothing - I want to understand that does this mean I have rolled back several days in my recovery cycle?  Is this an official relapse?  Is my improved blood circulations, nicotine presence in the body, etc. all rolled back several days?  

Stupid question I know but the reason i ask is that articles on what happens after you quit smoking was one of my key motivators during the initial quitting period.  I just want to know that smoking that stupid cigar did not take me back to the start.  Thanks guys.

Good luck on your quit missions.  stay quit !!

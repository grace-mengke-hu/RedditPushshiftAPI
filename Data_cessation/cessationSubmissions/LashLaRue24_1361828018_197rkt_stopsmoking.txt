Today, I hope to start a new life.

Sup, mafuckas. Today is day one. This task seems so daunting, but I'm so fucking tired of having to deal with my mind tricking me into thinking that smoking is helping me in any way, shape, or form. I've been dealing with depression for a few years, going to graduate college in another semester, and now I really need to get my life together to keep going in this world. Fuck smoking, I'm getting rid of my problems, and am going to start facing shit head on. Fuck always being tired, fuck my heart pounding from walking up some stairs, fuck all that money down the drain, fuck not remembering what being healthy and happy feels like, fuck the false sense of security in a dirty butt. We're doing it. Wish me luck.

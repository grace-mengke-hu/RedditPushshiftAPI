Wasn't I supposed to get better skin after quitting?

I am 30 years old and male. I have smoked moderately for 10 years (4-8 cigs a day). I quit 4 weeks ago.

I joined a gym at the end of august and decided it would be a nice time to quit smoking.

At first I thought everything was going fine, I didn't get many cravings but I did get hungry,

However, the worst thing, BY FAR, is how my face looks. I have suddenly developed an acne-ridden forehead. At 30! Never in my life have I had this happen. Not even during adolescence. What the hell is going on? 

The only thing that changed was that I quit smoking, so it has got to be linked to it.

It's making want to smoke again.

EDIT: Remove the F-word.

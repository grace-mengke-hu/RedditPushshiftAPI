Day one, again...

I quit for two years, then impulsively started again a few years ago after a VERY bad two weeks.

Lately, my cough has become feral, so I bought a vape kit today.

Last time, I did a three-session hypnotism and it worked, but I can't afford it right now. The vape kit cost the equivalent of three packs of ciggies (including a 30ml liquid). 

Because it's illegal for Australian retailers to sell nicotine-based liquid, I bought a non-nicotine one in my usual cigarette flavour (menthol). I've joined a buyers' club through which I can legally purchase nicotine-based liquid if I want to. However, I'm going to try it without over the weekend before deciding if I really want to go down that route.

I've already learned not to inhale too deeply or I'll cough just as if it was a real cigarette.

Part of my decision was the cough, but another part was going to two of the designated smoking areas on my uni campus during the past few weeks and finding the number of young smokers (young women, many Asian, in particular) has increased massively this semester. It made me really sad to see that...

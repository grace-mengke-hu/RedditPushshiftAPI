I'm on Day 7!!

But... I still am getting a craving. It's not the same almost painful craving I had the first day, but more of a lingering every other thought type of craving. Is there any tricks I can use to keep my mind of it? I've tried counting, and measuring my breathes, tapping my feet and singing in my head.. they only help so much.

How do I stop when I enjoy smoking?

I'll elaborate if you have any questions or tips, but seriously, I enjoy smoking but I know the damage it is doing to my body, but every time I try to quit, I go for the short term pleasure over the long term greater good and light up a cigarette.

I've been smoking since I was 16 and I'm 24 now. Help me. Please.

Unable to stop cold turkey

All I have been smoking for 2 years now and have been trying to quit this year for several times cold turkey. I also read the book Allen Carr, and tried 4 times to quit, I got to a maximum of 4 days and then an insane amount of cravings kicks in and my mind makes all kinds of excuses to get that pack of cigarettes again. I started with excessive vaping what got me the nicotine addiction, then I started smoking some cigarettes and was like why not switch to cigarettes, and there I am 2 years later with a sick nicotine addiction. With all things in life if I have a winner mindsets, hard worker, persistence, dedicated and mentality strong. When it comes to nicotine and quiting it won't work, and I am so fucking pissed on my self that I fail again. I am writing this, because I am currently on 3 day smoke-free and got insane amount of cravings and want to get a pack of cigarettes. I have been reading some posts about NRT and then my mind makes this up: "maybe you should just get a package, because you can't stop cold turkey, try it next time with NRT" -- my mind is trying to find every excuse in the book to get this pack of cancer. When will this mind games go away?

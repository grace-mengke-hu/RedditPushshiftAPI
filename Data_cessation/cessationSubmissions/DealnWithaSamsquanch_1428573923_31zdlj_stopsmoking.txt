This is my third day and I really don't know if I can

Been a smoker for 6 years. Quitting cold turkey because I have a daughter on the way and I don't want her to grow up and emulate my behavior. But goddamn this is hard. I've quit a lot of addicting things cigarettes are by far the hardest. I just don't know today, the cravings are getting really bad.

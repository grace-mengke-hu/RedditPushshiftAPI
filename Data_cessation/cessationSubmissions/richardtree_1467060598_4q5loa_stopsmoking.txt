1,000 Days

Today's my 1,000th nicotine free day.

Anybody considering quitting, trash your cigarettes and quit today, don't let the tobacco company profit off of your addiction and death. I never would have guessed I'd make it 2 days, let alone 1000 days.

No real purpose for this post, just felt like congratulating myself.

I wanna quit, but I just seem to can't

I've been a pack a day smoker since I was 17. I quit for a short period of time and then things got really stressful and I picked it back up a couple years ago. I feel like I try and I just can't seem to get past even one craving. As I'm posting this I'm smoking one down right now. I just don't know what to do. I feel like I'm a slave to the nicotine and I can't get free of it. It's always a feeling of just wanting one more cigarette and just getting that sweet buzz. I feel like I'm gonna lose my mind. Sometimes, I go a couple days and it's like my depression gets turned up to 11 and I feel like I can't even handle life. Things are really stressful too as I'm trying to go back to school and finish out an engineering degree which just makes everything harder. 

So, what is some advice to help quit? I've got a pack on me now and I'm telling myself that when I finish it, that's it.

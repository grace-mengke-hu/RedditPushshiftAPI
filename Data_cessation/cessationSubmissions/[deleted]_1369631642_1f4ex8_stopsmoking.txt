Reading EASYWAY for the 5th time...(looking for advice)

Every time I read it it works. I quit for months, only to find myself smoking again. I know it is easy to quit, but I get stupid and trick myself into starting again. I hate it. It has destroyed my confidence. I know it is bad for me, I know it uses all of my money. Worst of all...no one knows I smoke anymore. I've gotten so good at hiding it, even from my girlfriend. I don't want to live like this anymore. I know there are people that have been through exactly what I am going through, so please any extra advice or wisdom is much appreciated. 

I know it boils down to "Just do it, and don't let yourself feel deprived" but damn, I have to stop this. I don't even enjoy smoking anymore.

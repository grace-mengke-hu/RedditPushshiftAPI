Going cold turkey right now...

I just put out my last cigarette. I'm not using patches or even reading "the wonderful magical book". I have just quit right now! I know this isn't going to be easy. I've tried quitting several times, and each time I've had cravings so bad that I got unconditionally angry until I smoked, then even once I smoked I didn't really feel "better", I just had the craving disappear.

As long as these cravings don't last forever, I believe I can do it! What are your experiences with cold turkey?

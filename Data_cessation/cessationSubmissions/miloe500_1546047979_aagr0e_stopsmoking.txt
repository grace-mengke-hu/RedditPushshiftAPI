A New Approach - The Cigarette Investment Fund - Day 1

Day 1. 

Had my last cigarette with my coffee this morning. Opened up an account to purchase stocks (no experience in this area). Did a little research on the right app. Settled on one of several that offer free trades.

Deposited $10 into said account. The average cost of cigarettes in my state is ten bucks. On my break at work, purchased a share of stock. When the markets closed, I made a nickel. Used my next break to research a few other stocks I’m interested in.

Plan is to transfer $10 a day and not only use the financial resources, but time, spent smoking, researching investments and seeing how I fare in the stock market. Figure it’s money I would have literally burned anyway. 

Here goes nothing.

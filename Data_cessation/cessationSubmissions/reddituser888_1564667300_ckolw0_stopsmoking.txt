Anybody else here quit using Allen Carr’s method? If so, what did you do months later when the mental cravings/obsession come back in force?

I’ve quit using his method many times. My final cigarette was in 2009, but in the last few years I’ve been go going back and forth with Vaping and now I’ve stopped again for 3 months but I’m obsessing about nicotine again! 

Can anyone relate? Has anyone beaten it? Advice or experience appreciated!

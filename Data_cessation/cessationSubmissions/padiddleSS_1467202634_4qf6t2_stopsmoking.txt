Day 28 - A Reflection on Almost a Month

Been 28 days without a smoke. I stopped because I was lying. I was telling myself into thinking that I could stop anytime. I had told friends and my S.O. that I quit long ago. I was left to either tell everyone I had started again or quit. 

I was on my home from work. With a cigarette in hand I coughed uncontrollably and I had a flashback to my childhood. My parents both smoke. While cooking my mom would have coughing fits and you could hear the saliva in the back of her throat. It was an awful noise that my friends would make fun of. 

I threw out the cigarette and never looked back. I have cravings all the time. Dreams of smoking and waking up with regret. I have to actively avoid hanging out with some people to not smoke. I gave up drinking to quit. Cigs will always have a hold in my life. I believe that I will have cravings for years to come. That's fine, I'd rather enjoy the outdoors, biking, running, friends, family, coffee, food, smells, dancing, music, reading, camping, and money. 

Im writing this so I can read it later when I have a craving. If you're reading this I hope you make it. This shit sucks and so many people don't understand. It seems like we're just smokers who don't smoke. You can quit if you want too. This is completely up to you. I recommend giving a big ol' middle figure to the tobacco company though. 

Im writing this so I can read it later when I have a craving. Smoking is the most selfish thing I've ever done. I want to enjoy life with those around me. Every day I give big ol' middle figure to the tobacco company by breathing and smelling this shitty city air. Fuck you, tobacco.

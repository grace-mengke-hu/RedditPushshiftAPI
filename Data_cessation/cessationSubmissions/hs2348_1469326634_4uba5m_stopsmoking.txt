It's been roughly ten days since I stopped smoking..

I had nicotine patch on me for the first two days, and then took those out, although I do believe that having nicotine patch was somewhat helpful in keeping down the crave.  
I haven't put nicotine patches on me for a few days now, however. And I'm sort of having no urge, but the craving still kicks in a few times a day (which are thankfully not as bad as the cravings from first few days).  
It's my almost first time ever being successful to quitting for 2-digit days, and now I get that the craving doesn't all the way go away, it rather just stays there...  
Could anyone give me some tips to go on this journey?

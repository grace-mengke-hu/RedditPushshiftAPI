Just saw a pic of myself from a year and a half ago...I was smoking in it.

And my first thought was - 'that's so weird I used to smoke!".

It's been 14 months and that was a real interesting observation.  My brain now registers me smoking as really odd.

What a great moment!  Stay strong everyone.  If I can do it...ANYONE can!

[Seeking advice] Worried I've started a habit of smoking when drunk.

Up until a month ago I was strongly against smoking. It's the main reason all of my grandparents have died, second hand smoke incredibly annoys me and I used to be a fairly serious runner up until 4 months ago when I got injured.

I often go out drinking (study at uni in the UK) and a lot of my friends smoke, so I often stand in the smoking areas of clubs with them, or often go out just to socialise where the music isn't as loud and you can actually converse with people.

The problem started in early December when I was *really* drunk and I think the frustration of not being able to run, impending deadlines and a few other stuff made me think "fuck it, I'll give it a go" and had a few drags of my friend's cigarette. I then had some of my friends cigar when I was quite drunk on Christmas eve and since then almost every time I've been drunk I've craved a cig, or had one.

It was usually just the odd few drags of someone else's, until last night when I was drunk at a club, bumped into someone from my course and bought 3 cigarettes from her and had them all to myself. I know it's not a *huge* deal, but I'm very worried that this may turn into a long-term bad habit of smoking when I'm drunk. I even had my first cravings of one when sober this morning.

I am 100% sure I have the willpower not to smoke when sober, but I'm just wondering if anyone has any advice on how I can still go out and get drunk, but not smoke at all.

Question for anybody who has used Wellbutrin/bupropion to quit

I have been on wellbutrin for a week now, I started at 150mg the first day then jumped into 300mg/day. It has helped me substantially but I've been having moderate to severe anxiety since Saturday evening and Sunday to today I have been getting way too pissed off at little things and just had a shitty attitude in general. I understand that I'm quitting and am going through withdrawals and all that, but this seems a little severe for just quitting smoking.

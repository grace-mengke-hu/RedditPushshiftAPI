Fear of reading the book...

I ordered the book “Easy Way to Stop Smoking” about a month ago and I read half a page and it’s sitting on my back patio.  

I have realized that fear is what is keeping me from quitting.   It’s like a crazy psychopathic relationship that you don’t want to leave, but you know you need to, and you keep going back for the abuse.  Cuz you’re scared to change. 

Sigh... how do I overcome this.

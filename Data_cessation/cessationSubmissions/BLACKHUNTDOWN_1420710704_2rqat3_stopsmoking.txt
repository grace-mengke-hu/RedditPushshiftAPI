This sub helps me stay off the smokes.

I haven't gotten a badge as I'm a dumb arse but I'm 180 days as of 8/1/2015. I have a lot of mates who smoke and I always miss going for a smoke with my boss and all. I know I'm not a smoker but there's always the fact that if I smoke, I'm hooked. And when I see posts like I have recently about people's SO's saying they smell nice, not feeling like an ashtray, better wellbeing etc. it reminds me that the short term satisfaction of smoking ruins the long term benefits and the true enjoyment of not being a smoker. So I'd like to thank all the fantastic smelling, clean, healthy and awesome people in this sub, thanks to you I know I have others going through this and having the same enjoyment as me and I know that I will never be a smoker again!

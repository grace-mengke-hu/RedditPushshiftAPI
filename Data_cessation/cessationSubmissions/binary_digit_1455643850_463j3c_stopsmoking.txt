Me and Jeff the Diseased Lung - 1 Year Later

A year ago today I finally quit smoking.  When I made the decision to quit I felt certain that I was giving something up.  I didn't know how I would ever cope without my constant companion, but after watching [Jeff the Diseased Lung](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6UsHHOCH4q8) on John Oliver (trigger warning: people smoking in the linked video,) I knew I had to stop.

I credit John Oliver and Jeff with giving me the final push I needed to stop smoking, but far more credit goes to everyone here, and to Allen Carr.  I never would have succeeded if not for the words of my fellow redditors here.  Your support and encouragement has made all the difference in the world.  Special thanks to /u/my_vape_self for leading me to Allen Carr's Easy Way to Stop Smoking.

The first time I read the title of the book I laughed a bit to my self.  I had tried to quit countless times before, and there was nothing EASY about it.  Surely, I thought, there is no such thing as an "Easy Way to Stop Smoking."

One year later it is impossible to deny.  It was easy to stop smoking.  What was truly hard was getting up the will to decide to stop and really mean it.  To be able to say "Not One Puff Ever" and feel with conviction the truth of that statement.  I couldn't have done that without you all, and without Allen Carr (may he rest in peace.)

To those of you who take time out of your day to post here, thank you for sharing your trials and for sharing your strength.  It truly does make a difference.

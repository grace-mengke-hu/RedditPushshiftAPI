What is worse: COCAINE or NICOTINE?

So I was an ex smoker for over 2 years. But then something happened. I was in Egypt working as a YouTuber and I went VIRAL baby. Trending all over the internet. Things went crazy overnight. Then the following day, i was invited to meet VIPs and of course....parties and women.

So at the parties, I was mixing with these celebs and VIPs and was offered cocaine. Never done it, dont want to start now at aged 42. But it was so pumping man and I was BUZZING with the dopamine hit of instant fame, of 16,000 messages on my phone, of women throwing themselves at me. I needed something.

So for that week of crazy parties and too much dopamine in my head to sleep, my drug of choice was double espresso and cigarettes. I went back to the weed.

The cigarette each morning was great. I cannot deny it. That 15 second buzz, drag 2-6. And they were so good because I knew I had such an awesome day infront of me. But then each progressive cigarette was just vile. I remember why I gave up.

Got on the plane, stopped caffeine and cigarettes, head squeeze for about 10 days and now I'm fine. Until things get exciting again? It that how it is? Am I a recreational smoker? Because I know I cannot be one of those. They're a myth.

So: my questions: was I wise to choose nicotine and caffeine over cocaine and other hard drugs?

How can I deal with future times when things get wild? What should be my drug of choice? I am only human.

Cigarettes should get all the credit

Every nostalgic feeling you have about smoking is FALSE. 

It's just an illusion. 

What you remember is you felt shitty from....... withdrawal symptoms, the itch....cigarettes quenched those.. momentarily, giving the illusion of making you feel feeling good. 

Don't give cigarettes the credit for relieving a shitty feeling which they cause in the first place.							
							
The cigarettes do get the credit and should get the credit for the desire to smoke- instead of making the usual excuses to ourselves..
"I felt nervous"...
"I was sad, depressed"     .. "I had a lot of pressure at the time"....

"My dog died" . ..   " I was feeling sorry for myself, what does it matter anyway"

"I needed to concentrate!!"


All bullshit.!!!!

What you felt in all of those situations was the need to relieve NICOTINE WITHDRAWL.

That's the fact, Jack.

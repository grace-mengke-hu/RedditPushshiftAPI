I stopped 35 days ago but I had a setback.

Hi lads, and lasses (I don't want to neglect anybody), 

I quit smoking 35 days ago, actually it was even two weeks longer than that, but I had a serious car accident (totalled four cars) and I smoked almost a full pack on that day so I don't count the time before. 
Apart from that incident, it has been working out great, until last Friday when I had a smoke while I was wasted. 

And that's the reason why I'm posting,  I don't have that much of a problem with not smoking, but when I'm drunk I just crave cigarettes like crazy. 

Do you have any advice for me how to  handle this? (not getting drunk left aside) 


I did smoke because I liked it, and I'll probably start it again when feel like it again, but at this point I'm just not enjoying it and it is an easy way to make my girlfriend happy and safe money. 
But I just can't control my inner demon when I'm pissed.

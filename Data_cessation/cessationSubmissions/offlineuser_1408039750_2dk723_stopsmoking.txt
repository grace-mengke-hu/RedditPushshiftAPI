Have I ever said how incredibly attractive you all are?

No?  Well, let me start by saying that, in my esteemed ~~and unbiased yet undeniably professional~~ opinion, you are all, in fact, the epitome of attraction; indeed, the sexiest beings to have ever graced this dear planet some of us choose to call Earth.  Whatever creature responsible for your emergence from the womb or infantile sac of nutritious goo is a genius.  Since I'm there, hey creature, have I ever told YOU just how absolutely drop-dead gorgeous you are?  No?  Well, read that last sentence again.  In it you'll find the implication that you are absolutely, without a shred of doubt, drop-dead gorgeous.  And don't think I forgot about you, badgebot.  Whatever elixir of life you've been drinking has turned you into a sex god (dare I say sex panther?), worthy of only the finest loins on either side of the Mississippi.  Might I make the suggestion, O tamer of 'tang, to reap what you've sown here in r/stopsmoking?  Alas, I digress.

A warm and hearty thank you to everyone here for sharing the smoke-free libation which you have so thoughtfully taught me to imbibe.

I'm Tired of being tired. (Day 1)

I'm tired of feeling like a prisoner. I'm tired of the anxiety and depression that come along with addiction. I'm tired of having low self esteem. I'm tired of my body hurting and the fear that comes along with it. I'm tired of envisioning a future where I don't smoke Everytime I light up. I'm tired of my money and more importantly, my priorities, being hindered by a foreign chemical. I'm tired of waking up coughing. I'm tired of always having an excuse. I'm tired of feeling like I'm trapped. I'm tired of being tired. 

Day 1 for me. I've quit alcohol and painkillers in the past, but I know this is going to be, mentally, the toughest improvement to make yet. But I'm ready. I have an idea of how I'm going to change my life, and not just wallow in self pity that I don't smoke anymore. I'm going to be confident and use healthy vices to deter my urges for unhealthy ones. Once I have won this battle, I can rest easy knowing I stayed true to myself. I'm ready.

Thanks for reading.

Today I made the decision. It has come time to stop.

Burned the rest of my cigs! Quitting cold turkey is going to be difficult but I am ready to accept the challenge. My health is far more important to me than how I have been treating myself. Please send me support as I go through this, any and all will be greatly appreciated!

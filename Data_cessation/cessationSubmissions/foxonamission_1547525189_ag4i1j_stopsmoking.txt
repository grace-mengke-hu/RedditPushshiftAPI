One week rollercoaster

The transparency of this forum has been so helpful these past 7 days. I can’t believe I made it to day 8 after 17 years of smoking a pack a day. It’s been a rollercoaster that hasn’t really gotten easier. Some days go by with ease and others are a constant struggle. I’m getting more frustrated with myself these past few days: I have gained some weight and am tired of my bad attitude ex: “i want a cigarette, why did i chose to stop NOW and make things harder? When will i stop thinking about it? Will i ever NOT crave a cigarette?———blah blah blah. Everyone is so proud &amp; supportive but why can’t I FEEL proud of what i have done so far? Mind over matter is really difficult right now. I appreciate all of you sharing your experiences in the early AND later stages of your quit. You are all so strong &amp; inspiring! Xoxo

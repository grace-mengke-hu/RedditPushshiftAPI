started the patch tonight (feelin' positive)

I tried the gum, the puffer, the mints, even tried the pills and the vape. I'm finally trying the patch... feel like I'm really going to quit this time and I want to do it I want to quit and I'm moving away soon so I think this will be helpful removing myself from an enviroment of smokers around me. So, it kind of feels like the pieces are falling into place for me for a change. I was really craving a smoke even after I put the patch on, I put it on the upper arm. But I think I don't have a craving now, and it's been maybe 30 minutes since I put on. I don't know if I'm getting maximum craving protection yet?? Anyways I'm in the 15-20 smokes per day range so I'm on 1 patch of step 1. Anyone needed to use 2 at once? Did it help? I got the store brand one and even those I found it to be expensive, so I just got 7 patches instead of a 2 week box. Is there any coupons I can get for nicoderm or the like? I guess it is cheaper than smoking.... if it works and I can stick to it. Anyone have bad side effects to the patch? I'm just coming off the flu so I haven't been smoking as much. Does anyone have recommendations about where to place the patch? I thought maybe the chest or back might be good to try if I didn't get craving relief, we'll see... Any other tips? I'm done this post and I am having a sudden and severe craving, already..... HA X) Maybe I'll return the opened package tomorrow and say they didn't work.

Day 19 And what has worked for me so far..

PHYSICAL CRAVINGS - Now only if try to remember I had sleepless nights and cravings for the first 4 or 5 days atmost. It was not hard like the previous quits as this time I really wanted to quit and was feeling so happy to quit. I realized the demons in ur head are bigger than nicotine. Staying away from coffee and tea for the first few days has helped me. I also decided to stay away from alcohol or any other stuff for 40 days.
EMOTIONAL CRAVINGS- I had a good share of stressful situations and happy times where I wanted to smoke really bad. These were far harder than the physical cravings. All I did was to keep telling myself cigarettes will not make my situation worse or better. And urge is gone in 10 minutes to 1 hour atmost.
BEHAVIORAL CRAVINGS- Since i was a heavy smoker for 9 years. I associate myself with smoking with a lot things like talking on the phone, driving, first thing in the morning, alcohol, boredom, hanging out with friends, and what not. For somethings I still have to find replacements ( any suggestions would greatly appreciated). For some I found something.  
           Sorry for the long rant. Thatâ€™s my journey of 19days cold turkey.

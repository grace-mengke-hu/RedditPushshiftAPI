Day 3... Is a couple puffs of an E-Cig cheating?

So I am on day three without any cigs. I have taken a couple puffs of an e-cig at times that I thought I was going to put my hand through a wall. I was wondering what you guys think of that. Would you consider a couple puffs of an e-cig cheating? 

This has been probably the roughest 3 days I have had in a while. Day one started out a sweaty, gross, dizzy, nasty mess. Day two, not as bad as one. But for some reason, day three has been the most irritable day yet. I have been so damn cranky all day. I've almost broke my laptop several times today. But, I need to keep going because I want to finally call this the actual time I quit. What do you guys tell yourself whenever your brain goes to the "Its okay to smoke, you like it, why would you give something up that you like?"

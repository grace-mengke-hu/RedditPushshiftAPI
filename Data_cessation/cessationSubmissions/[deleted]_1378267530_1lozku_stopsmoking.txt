First time in over a year I've gone 2 days without smoking

The other night I was sleeping and I woke up coughing very violently. I don't know if it was from my smoking or not but that was the moment I decided I was done with smoking. I had a few left in my pack and finished them the next day but after that I haven't smoked. It's been two days now and I only felt the urge once, I was about to drive and buy a pack but I didn't. All my urges are gone. I was afraid smelling the smoke from other smokers would trigger my urges but the haven't. I tried quitting a couple times before but this is the first time I feel good about it.

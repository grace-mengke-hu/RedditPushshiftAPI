craving a cig after having vehicle stolen

I quit cold turkey nearly 3 years ago. I won't really smoke and I know it won't resolve this problem but some dirtbag stole my business vehicle this morning and I am beyond pissed and some primal thing inside of me keeps telling me I want to light up! So PISSED !!!

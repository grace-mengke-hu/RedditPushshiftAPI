Anyone experiencing indigestion?

I quit smoking 4 days ago due to being really sick with an upper respiratory infection, so I just decided I was done. It’s actually been fine so far, except that I have really, REALLY bad indigestion. Tums aren’t helping, drinking water isn’t helping. I still have a cough from having been sick, and every time I cough it feels like I’m going to puke because my indigestion is so bad. Anybody have any tips?

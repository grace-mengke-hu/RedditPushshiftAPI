¯\_(ツ)_/¯ I don't feel very accomplished at all, even though I haven't had a drag for months.

It's been months and I *still* only seem to be able to focus on wanting M100s. I feel very little pride for having made it 3-5 months-ish without. Why is this?  Shouldn't I feel more of a sense of pride, rather than just perpetual discomfort?  (If this is a shitty post I apologize, I'm quite heavily buzzed at the moment.)

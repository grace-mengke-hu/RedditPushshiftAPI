Tiny relapse and beloved guilt

I had a tiny relapse ciggy and I feel really guilty, I feel like shit, like I’m not gonna succeed. Or better that’s how I used to feel, that’s what used to overthrow me and now it’s more of an imprint that I’m able to observe, not that it’s completely emotion free. I just want to observe it and move on. Not make it another chapter in my beloved book of failures. I know that guilt and bad habits are tightly linked, in my case they are at least. So I choose to forgive myself. I choose to love myself. Btw every time i keep up with my practice of self love and gratitude and meditation it’s very easy to be on the right path. And I’m more likely to lose my way when I don’t... So i know what to do, I mostly know why it happened, the most important thing that I need to know now and be sure of is do I want it to happen again, will I let it happen or will I fight for myself?  Also not drinking or anything else and I value this sobriety. It is rewarding although I was not a heavy drinker and although as life got a little bit overwhelming these past few days, I’ve felt like curling back up in my old, easy -but fake- fix habits. But everything is temporary. And every challenge makes you grow if you allow it to. I hope you’re growing and getting freer everyday. 
Much love y’all !! We are very brave you know ?! ❤️🙏🏾

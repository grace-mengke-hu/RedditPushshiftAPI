Day 2: Checking in. Care to join me in not smoking?

I thought I'd check in after my meltdown [yesterday](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/2unri7/im_in_trouble/). 

Yesterday I felt awful. Today I feel great. Today has been a good day. 

I'd like to thank all of you for being there when I was in need, it was such a huge help and I'm so grateful. I'm on top of the world right now. I've had a really good day in general, everything has gone so well with work and I'm pretty pleased with myself. 

I've been listening to some [Allen Carr](http://youtu.be/8SJOASOBLmU) as suggested by /u/RahmsFinger and I don't know why I haven't up until now. I always thought I should be strong enough to go alone but I realise that was a mistake. I'm not very far through but I'm hoping that with this I can inoffensively suggest it to my mother to help her stop too. 

But anyway, today I'm not smoking. Care to join? How was your day? I hope it's been a good one!

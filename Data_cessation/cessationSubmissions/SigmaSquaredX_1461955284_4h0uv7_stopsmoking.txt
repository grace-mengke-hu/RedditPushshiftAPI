A fundamental question on how i should percieve my quitting of nicotine

So i'm 22, smoked for 7 years and haven't smoked a cigarette in a month and 2 weeks. However i have every now and again (perhaps once a week) smoked a joint, obviously containing a small amount of tobacco. 

I'm wondering how many of you think:
 a) Tobacco is the bad shit, you ain't stopped till you don't smoke no more tobacco
or b) quitting smoking is already hard enough without having to give up all the associated pleasures like alcohol and weed.

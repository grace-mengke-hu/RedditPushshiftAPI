Don't think I'm addicted to nicotine. . Maybe something else?

I've tried quitting a 100 times cold turkey and always fail. So this time I bought an electronic cigarette and some nicotine mints. 

Ive tried a few times since going about it this way and i'm getting all the nicotine I could ever crave but i'm still spinning out and literally my head is all over the place almost like I'm ill. 

Mentally I'm in the right place to quit, I can tell the cravings to go fuck themselves but i'm still irritable amd snappy, so my question is am I addicted to another ingredient other than nicotine?

I have kids and want to quit for them but I've deliberately smoked so I don't lose my shit with them. Kind of a vicious circle.

I'd be grateful for anyones thoughts or experiences.

Day 2 - feeling exhausted and upset

I am approaching the end of day 2 (yay me!) and I'm feeling *very* tired and sad/angry. Yesterday (day 1) was easily one of the worst days I've had in a long time :/ Is this normal? My first time quitting I wasn't this upset, and I'm picking fights and crying before falling straight to sleep all over again. Regardless, I'm proud of me for doing it this long. Thank you for the encouragement in my last post, it really helped me focus on my goals!!

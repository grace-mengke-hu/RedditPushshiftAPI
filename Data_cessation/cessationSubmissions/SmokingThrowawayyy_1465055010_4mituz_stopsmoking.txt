Over 3 weeks nicotine free, stress and anxiety is really tempting me to relapse [Personal rant, just need to get this off my chest]

Throwaway because this is a bit too personal for my liking.

I smoked for 4 years, and I feel much better now that stopped smoking. But every day I'm so tempted to 'have just 1' because of all of the stress I have to put up with.

I'm almost 23, and I still live with my parents. We're very poor, and because of that I thought I'd never be able to afford to go to college. I spent my years after high school years being depressed and wasting my life away until recently, I decided it was time for a change.

For the last few months I've tried so damn hard to get a job. I've never had one previously and I've not been to college so I'm already at the bottom tier. I've applied everywhere that isn't as 'Mom and Pop' type store (I mean, if McDonalds wouldn't hire me why would these?). and I've only received one call about an interview - and that didn't go over well and they chose someone else.

After some thought and consulting my friends, I've decided to apply for a communtity college to get my associate degree since they said my financial aid would cover it. Cool. Except that it doesn't kick in until about a month after I've already been in school. My parent's literally can't afford the gas to drive me there and back out of their own pocket. So no job-->no college. No college--->no job. Fantastic.

On top of all that my SO has been increasingly distant from me the past week, and it's making me feel even more worthless than I already do.

It's so temping just to tell myself that I deserve at least one. But then all the suffering I went through to get this far would be for nothing. All I know is that I could really use a couple pints of a strong drink.

I needed to get this off my chest so thank you to anyone that has took the time to read in this far. This community has really helped me stay quit and I'm glad to be a part of it.

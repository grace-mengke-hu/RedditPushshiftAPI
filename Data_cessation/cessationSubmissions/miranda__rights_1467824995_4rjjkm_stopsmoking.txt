Other reasons aside, do you/did you have a singular, most important reason for quitting?

I've tried to quit a million times in the past. I went to the dentist for a cleaning a few days ago, and as soon as she began she asked me "Still smoking a lot, huh?" I asked her "You can tell that easily?" She nodded her head. I don't have any dental problems (except I need my wisdom teeth out, but who doesn't), but I'm not about to live with smokers' teeth forever. 

It might seem like a silly reason to up and quit, but since I love to smile and smile big, especially in pictures, I don't want a mouth of yellow candy corn.

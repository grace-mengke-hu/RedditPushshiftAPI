Not doing so well...

I just made myself a delicious dinner, cleaned the kitchen, started the dish washer, started a load of laundry, and just want to sit on my front porch and enjoy a smoke. Just one. I won't, though.

I have $20 left in my wallet and I will have $20 tomorrow because I will *not* be purchasing a pack of cigarettes...even though I really want to. My reasoning is, "oh, well you've gone 2 (almost 3) days. You can enjoy *one* and then continue on with your progress!" No, nicotine; it isn't happening. 


Luckily, I am not having any headaches! I just am feeling fidgety...so very fidgety.

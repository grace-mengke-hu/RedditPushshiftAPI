I'm excited! And a question for everyone at the end.

I made my first doctors appointment in five years because I'm not too embarrassed to go. I also made a dental appointment. I have been to the dentist more recently but I always planned it early in the morning so I wouldn't have a chance to smoke too much beforehand. Hurray! Is there anything you guys are celebrating being able to do because you aren't smoking?

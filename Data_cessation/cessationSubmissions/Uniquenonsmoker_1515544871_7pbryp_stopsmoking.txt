Heartburn. Intense, intolerable heartburn. Also, Everyone, keep kicking butt(s)!

Anyone else experiencing heartburn on speed? I think my alternative (sliced almonds when I’m driving vs. smoking) may not be helping; I know that quitting smoking also can increase this. 

Oye. I dislike this. And the insomnia I mentioned in a different post. And the headache. And sometimes that bottomless feeling in my stomach....and, and, and....

Know what I AM enjoying? Not smoking. More time with my kids and doing my job. Not wheezing. I know these sx’s will go away (eventually!)

Tips for clearing out your lungs after quitting?

One thing I'd like to work on as I'm quitting (two weeks now) is getting as much of the tar and whatever other shit is in my lungs out of them as quickly as possible.

Does anyone have any helpful advice for clearing your lungs out / getting back to easy breathing a little faster?

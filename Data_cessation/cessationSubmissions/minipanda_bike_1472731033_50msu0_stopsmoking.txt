My boyfriend wants me to help him quit smoking. I have no idea what I'm doing.

My boyfriend told me yesterday he was afraid to stop smoking. He has been reducing his consumption for the last 3 years (went from almost a pack King size a day to 7 cigs regular)  but he hit a plateau in the last year and can't go beyond this point by himself I believe. He kinda asked me for help. I know this is generally a very personal journey and people tend to do it by themselves. I really want to help but I am not a smoker and never was so I have no idea what I can do or how I can be a good influence/supporter for him. 

Anyone who has stopped smoking with the help of a close one can tell me what should my role be and maybe give me insight on what things I can do to help?

Quiting today.

I've been smoking about 15 cigarettes a day since 08. I quit about a year 2 years ago for 8 months and it was awesome. My work outs were great and I completely forgot that I was ever a smoker (unless I was out drinking with friends) I've been on here lurking for a little. I know I need to quit and read some horror stories about smoking. All I need to remember is I quit before, also excuse my language I am not a fucking bitch... I don't like when things in life control me. Why should I let cigs?

6 Years!

As of February 4, I've been smoke-free for 6 *long* years.

One of the most fantastic things is that neither of my kids remembers me as a smoker.  Granted, my daughter is only 8- but my son is 15. They both were genuinely shocked to hear my wife and I talk about the day I quit.

Yes, I still talk about smoking, because even now- it's a bit of a struggle from time to time. I still think about smoking, I still somewhat romanticize it- it's "coolness"... Truth be told, the addict in me still insists that I *miss* smoking. 

Now, that isn't to say that my "struggle" is difficult. It isn't. Not anymore. Choosing not to smoke is easy now. I never have a real craving- not like I did when I first quit.  No, those days are long over.

And so long as I don't forget them- I'm sure they'll never return.

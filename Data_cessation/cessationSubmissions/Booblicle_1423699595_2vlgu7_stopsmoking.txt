Wow. 480 days!

Lately I've been having these strong nostalgia of before I ever had a cigarette - some 25+ years ago. Sometimes I'm not able to Identify the source or reason. And other times it's right under my nose, pun intended! But i've figured out that most of them, if not all are related to cigarettes, or lack of. For one, smelling my environment carries meaning to me again, and was one of my major motivations to quit. But the others I think it has to do with.. being care free. That's right. Not only not worrying, but the thought of cigarettes rarely strikes my mind, and not because I want one. In fact smoking seems foreign to me now. And I cant really stand that I live with others that smoke and refuse to take it outside. Which is kind of humorous because I was just like them. But enough about me. This should be about you!

I know many of you have been struggling, or at least think you are. A lot of it is all up in that little grey blob we call the brain.

 First is identifying a reason to quit. Not just a reason. but a strong personal reason that takes on meaning for yourself. For myself it was my ability to smell, and without a stuffy nose. 

Next is Identifying it as an addiction. I struggled with this for years. I used to understand everything about habits and changing my mindset for performance, but could not figure out why I could not give up smoking. I thought it was a habit. I don't want to advertise for Allen Carr's Book But That's exactly what it took for me to understand this. Only then was everything else put together for me. ( this along with about 20 other mind traps that keep you smoking ) 

I just realized how long this wall of text is getting and I'm not trying to make a book even if the possibility exists ( despite my grammar skills ). I just want to give people some enthusiasm in knowing that there really is an exit at the end of the journey. And with it, Better health, freedom, and fresh air!

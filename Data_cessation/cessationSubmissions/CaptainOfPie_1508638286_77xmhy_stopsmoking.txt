About a week in and I'm not sure I can do this.

I'd be lying if I said it was easy to get this far. I've been a some what average smoker for about 5 years now. I've taken little breaks here and there but this time I hope is it. I'd be lying if I said I didn't wanna smoke ever again. I want cigs to be like a reward or something I do on holidays or vacation only. Any advice there folks?

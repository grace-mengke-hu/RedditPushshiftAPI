It's done, time for bigger and better!

I've done it, no more smoking! I'm never going to smoke another cigarette again. Right now I'm scared but so excited at the same time. For the past couple of months I've been thinking about each cigarette I put in my mouth. With each one I just think to myself why? Knowing the answer, to just feel normal but it wasn't normal, I feel tired, broke, worn out, lacking self confidence. They don't agree with me mentally, physically or spiritually. So I'm done for good, I've got cravings to kick in the butt so I had to share the good news, this is what I've wanted this since the day I started but something feels so right this time. I don't wanna put one of those filthy things in my mouth ever again!

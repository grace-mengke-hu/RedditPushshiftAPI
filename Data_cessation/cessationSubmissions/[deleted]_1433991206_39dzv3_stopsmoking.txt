At 4 months now and am i the only one who doesnt think the 1st month is the hardest?

this is my second time giving up after giving up for a few years before, i started again because of depression and its been a few years smoking again.

Anyway i stopped again 4 months ago but am i the only one who doesnt think the 1st month is the hardest? i sware its like the first 6 months that is the hardest, im at the 4th month now and ups and downs sometimes feeling very very horrible withdrawal effects such as bad anxiety but have noticed improving..

Tips are  go excercise regularly that helps a lot. I found reading helps too

but can i ask what months you found the hardest? if someone asked me id say the first 6 months are the hardest but 1 year to truely have conquered it, well share your experiences i dont use any additional aids.

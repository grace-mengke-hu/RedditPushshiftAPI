How do you handle not smoking when drinking?

I've quit before for 1year+ and relapsed after a break-up but I've quit other times for stints of 2 weeks, 1 month, etc and all of them I've relapsed while drinking. Right now I'm on 1 day no smoking. 

Do I have to never drink again in my entire life? This all seems so daunting. I'm supposed to have a few drinks this Friday with some old friends and I'm afraid I will relapse...

Any tips?

Went smoke 11 days ago, but i think i need one

I was here couple of months back. Signed up for a badge and stuck to no smoking. But i think i didnt want to quit that time so i caved in. This time I think I've done pretty well till now. Fought off major triggers and huge cravings (smoking while drinking on friday nights), on my own. My roommate helped out a lot during these.

But now the problem is that I have some fight/quarrel going on with my parents about life in general (marriage,career etc). Every evening I talk to them discussing something and end up upsetting everyone. These are the exact moments i used to smoke before. They used to slow down my thinking to a point where i would eventually drift off and focus on something else. There is no extra measure i see other than staying determined. But any extra help/advice would be great. Just wanted to share!

9 hours smoke free

Today is day one. I'm a mum to two toddler boys. I managed to quit when I was pregnant with both of them, then when I finished breastfeeding them, I took up my most relaxing past time - smoking. God, do I enjoy it....but I can't do it to them and I can't do it to myself anymore. They're at an age now where they ask me what I'm doing outside and tell me I smell funny before I can wash my hands and try and mask it with deodorants/perfumes. I can't lie to them anymore about what I'm doing. I don't want them to think its okay to smoke. It's not. Its slow suicide and I don't want to commit. I want to live, to watch them live, to live WITH them... I'm feeling weak and vulnerable, that's why a decided to post. Writing my reasons down has helped me turn my weak moment back into a positive affirmation that I'm doing the right thing. Thanks for listening.

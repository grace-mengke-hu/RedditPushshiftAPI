Help with Champix (Chantix in the US) nausea?

Hi all,

I'm on my 2nd week of Champix and the whole time the tablets have made me nauseous no matter if I've eaten or not or what time of day I've taken them. The white 0.5mg tablets weren't too bad so I was able to get on with my day and just ignore it for the most part, but the blue 1mg tablets are just killing me. I take the first one at 8am and feel really sick until about 5pm. I can't really rest just after taking my tablets either because I care for my grandmother full time which involves watching her all the time and a surprising amount of heavy lifting.

I haven't been to a doctor about this yet because the clinics in this area are been booked solid since there's a bad flu going around the schools meaning lots of sick kids and parents and I'd like to keep anti nausea medication as a 2nd last resort (last resort being stop taking Champix). I'd prefer not to use another medication while on Champix, but the only natural things I can find have ginger in them. Just my luck, the taste of ginger makes me throw up even when I'm not feeling sick. I usually use peppermint tea, but it seems to be sold out EVERYWHERE. Any other suggestions before I go to the pharmacy for something OTC to try?

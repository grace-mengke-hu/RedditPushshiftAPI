Stopping today, my goals and my questions.

Today I quit smoking. I've been planning this for awhile, but it always seemed like something would get in the way, whether it was a party where I knew drinking would be involved, my entire engagement, or a honeymoon where I didn't want to feel stressed out. However, all of that is over and I have no real excuse now.

Drinking has been a big roadblock for me in the way of quitting. I've constantly thought to myself that I'll never be able to quit because I enjoy my few drinks after work, but I tend to enjoy those while chain smoking. But enough is enough. I wake up with a heavy chest, I get winded easily, and I cough up more crap than I could imagine my lungs can hold, and I'm only 29.

I'm using nicotine patches. I don't like the idea of having to still have nicotine, but I've realized that in the past, cold turkey hasn't worked to well for me. 

I'm setting short-term goals this time instead of big long term ones that are so far out of sight, they would be pointless. One, I want to get through the day without having a cigarette. Two, I want to have a drink within 2 weeks without having a cigarette (one drink). Three, I want to get to the next step on this patch plan.

I do have a question about the patches. I quit several years ago for about 8 months using the patch. I used step one for about 2 weeks and then just stopped all together. It worked fine for another 7.5 months, but clearly I started smoking again, mainly because of an active social scene back then, which no longer exists as much for me. This plan calls for 6 weeks on step one. Then several more steps after that. 

Is that really needed, or can I do what I did last time if I can? I feel confident in my ability to go without the nicotine. It seems my habit is more based around habbitual addiction than fear of withdrawl. 

Any advice? Any other goals I should set in the short term?

experiencing cravings after week or two of on/off chain-smoking--curious about future

Started smoking (idiotically) as a stimulant to help me both focus and level out my anxiety.  Since I have such a high caffeine tolerance, I needed something else and I didn't want to be doing adderall much b/c of the side effects.  I figured I'd quit right after finals.  Now, I'm experiencing cravings after just about a week of intense smoking unfiltered american spirit tobacco, and that makes sense.  I wonder if the long term psychological cravings will come with just such a short duration.  I also have done this and quit about a couple weeks ago.
figured someone here might have some perspective

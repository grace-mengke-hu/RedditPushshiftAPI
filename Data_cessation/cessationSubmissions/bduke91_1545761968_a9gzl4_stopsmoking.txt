Bleeding underneath nicotine patch?

First off Merry Christmas.

 Anyone else experience this? I've been on the patch for about 4 weeks now. Put on my 21 mg patch this morning. Wife said it looked red. A couple hours later I was changing for Christmas and noticed I was bleeding underneath the patch. I've also got the flu today. Wondering if it's from the patch.

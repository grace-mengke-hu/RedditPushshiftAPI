I WILL NOT SMOKE...

I quit smoking 681 days ago after over 50 years. I ran out of cigarettes and just decided it wasn't worth the hassle and didn't buy another pack. I told myself that I was a non-smoker and accepted the urge to smoke as part of my character and didn't surrender. It has worked because I didn't deny that I sometimes wanted  to smoke but I refused to do it. The urge will continue but it will weaken and be more easily dismissed as time passes. It's all in the mind. The body will follow.

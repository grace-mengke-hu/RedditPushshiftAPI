2 Week!

It's been 2 weeks! 

I want to say it got a lot "easier" after the first week. I know that I've still got a long way to go. Cravings certainly haven't gone away completely. I know I have to stay vigilant because they can come out of nowhere. I'm pretty busy recently with a pending move and my cat has dental surgery tomorrow, etc.

I still read the sub and go through a lot of toothpicks (I don't necessarily chew through them all but I drop them on the ground a lot and just grab another one.)

My 1 week post was probably more thoughtful but I'm glad to be getting time under my belt. As I said, I have stuff going on, but I also know that with the season changing, the whole world can seem a little different, and I think that can be a big help. I ended a summer without smoking/vaping and now I'm going into a winter without it from the beginning. This means that more and more, nicotine will become a distant memory I'm glad to be away from. 

Thanks for being here /r/stopsmoking. I'll keep reading and maybe commenting here and there but my next post will be at 1 month, assuming I'm not smack in the middle of the move, but there will be a next post.

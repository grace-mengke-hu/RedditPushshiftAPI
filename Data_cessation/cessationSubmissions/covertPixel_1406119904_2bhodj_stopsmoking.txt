I made it. You can too!

Ladies and germs, I have made it past the 1 year mark. This is a serious achievement as I haven't been one year smoke free since I was 14. Smoking definitely altered my brain chemistry, messed up my reward based functionality, messed with my self esteem. It made me stink and it made me poorer. I let smoking control my every day activities and it stole time from me. Years from me. 

If you still smoke and you want to quit. Do it now and don't wait.  Make a good decision and give up a terrible habit.  It will suck. You won't feel right for months and there will be many times that you can't stand the with-drawl or the stress. Stick with it regardless. Come to this community and post about your anxiety. Read other people's stories and understand that you are not going through this battle with addiction alone. 

Thank you /r/stopsmoking you really helped me. I read this subreddit religiously the first 4 months.  Good luck to everyone! You can do it!

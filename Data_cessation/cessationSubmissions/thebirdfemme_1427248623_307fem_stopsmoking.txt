ladies - how do you get through the week before your time?

I always get super depressed in the days before I start bleeding and it always make it so fucking difficult for me to not smoke. Ignore my flair; it's incorrect and I need to fix it. I quit again but I don't know the date lol just one day I ran out of cigs and didn't buy a new pack.

I haven't really had any cravings this time around until now and I know it's because of my stupid fucking female organs. and it's gona be like this for a few days. Please help

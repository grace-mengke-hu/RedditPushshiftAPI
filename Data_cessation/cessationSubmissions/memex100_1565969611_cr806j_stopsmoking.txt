Just some random thoughts

Every time I'm about to attempt a quit, I come up with a list of things I need to get done first.  Sometimes it takes me so long to get through the list, I come full circle and all of those things I needed to get done first have come due again, so here we go, step right up folks, hop on the ride that never ends unless you jump.  And when you jump, you don't know where you're going to land.  Sometimes you land in the water, sometimes you land on a pile of rocks.  If you've quit enough times, on rare occasion you land in a Summer meadow with wildflowers and sweet grass.  But the latter happens so rarely, and the rocks so much more often, that you come to just expect the rocks.  But when you think back to that time you landed in the meadow, your thoughts were good, weren't they?  You were feeling good and optimistic, determined.

Why are we already deciding where we're going to land?  And if we're going to- actually, *get to*\- predetermine where we're going to land, why are we choosing the shittiest option?  "I have to get all of this shit done because I'm going to be pretty much dead to the world when I quit."  That's not true.  I've had quits where after the first few days, I was right back to normal.  One of those deals where I didn't start again because I was longing for a smoke, but because something happened that triggered panic in me, and I broke.  But I had been doing REALLY WELL.  

So, I'm trying to keep in mind that we decide what the quit is going to be like, not the other way around.  I'm allowing room for it to be The One, and easy, and almost joyful.  It can happen- we decide, we decide, we decide.

Naaa, smoking is cool, there is totally no consequences at all. /s

Be 30, smoking for 10 years. Yeah, is not even a week after my last cigar but

Last Monday got a pneumothorax (collapsed lung), get a tube through your ribs (extremely painfully), get 5 days laid down in a hospital in middle pain seeing old people with a range of pulmonary diseases, get the tube out and get some stitches, go back home, still have pain from the stitches and still going to have to do some tacs and other things... Smoking gets me 50% more chances of a another pneumothorax in the future...

Well, obviously the last time I smoked was before the day this happened. Obviously I will not touch a cigar again. 

Just a reminded for you all, just a reminder for myself: There are consequences, there are multiple diseases to get you if you still insist to smoke, it might not even be cancer, but there are a lot of consequences. Each day it passes with you smoking is just one more day for the "friend of the friend that got to the hospital because of smoking" to be you. 

There really are consequences, some of them really BAD consequences, you will not escape them, you're not special or lucky, each cigar you smoke is just another try to win the lotto, good luck with that.

Gained almost 5 pounds in 3 months after quitting

I was sure it was my new birth control. So I went to see the doctor tonight and she assured me that my weight gain was from when I quit smoking 3 months ago. I haven't changed anything, in fact, when I first saw this happening, I cut down alcohol/sweets intake and increased healthy foods and exercise. And I'm still gaining. She said it was because my metabolism has slowed. I am not eating more than I was. What can I do to help this?? I was so discouraged that I smoked my first cigarette on my way home from the doctor.

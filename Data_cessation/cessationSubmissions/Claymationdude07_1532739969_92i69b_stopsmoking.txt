Everyday the last few weeks has been the same cycle

1. Smoking is dumb
2.Quitting will be easy
3.*has last cig in pack*
4.this sucks
5.*drives to store*
6. “I’m not buying cigs, I’m not buying cigs, I’m not buying cigs”
7. Cashier, “will that be all today?” “I’ll have some camels”... 

Every day/night I tell myself I’m going to quit, then within half a day I’m back at the store buying more. It feels almost like an automated response. I don’t think in that moment, I just do. 

What’s some advice for when the time comes to check out and I know I can get cigarettes?

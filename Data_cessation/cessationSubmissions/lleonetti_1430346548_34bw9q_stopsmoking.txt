17, trying to quit smoking

I started smoking this year in the beach during January with my friends, I don't really like cigarettes; I mostly smoke gudang garam. For those who don't know, gudang is a clover cigarette that lowers your pressure and in my opinion its effect is awesome, but on the other side it's way worse than any tobacco cigarette and it's just as addictive.

Basically, I'm trying to quit because I know it's a really shitty habit and it has no positive effects besides a "high" that lasts like 5 minutes. I stopped for a while already when I travelled to the US for a college tour (I'm from Brazil) and I didn't feel any urges but as soon as I came back I started smoking again. I don't think I have a very serious problem, I smoke like 1 or 2 packs a week, but I smoke almost every day and to me it's a serious enough problem.

I want to know what's the best way to quit. It's really hard for me to just drop it all at once so I was thinking about trying to reduce my habit gradually until my vacation in June, then I'll travel somewhere where I won't be able to smoke and just stop then. Is there other way you guys think I should try quitting or is my plan ok? Also, any tips or anything at all I should know?

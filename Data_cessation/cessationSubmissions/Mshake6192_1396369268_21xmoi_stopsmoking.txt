A quitting technique that helped me out.

I've been a smoker for 5 years. I'm 22 years old and haven't had any children yet. I know that when I do have a kid, I will do everything I can to make sure he/she is as healthy as possible. 

So my idea was to treat my heart as if it is my unborn child. Specifically if he/she was about 14-16 years old. Would I want my child to be around smoke? No. I would be pissed off if anybody smoked a cig near my child. I want my child to be healthy and live a long happy life. 

This also helped me in other aspects of life. I would want my him/her to get 60 minutes of exercise and not be lazy. This has motivated me to do SOMETHING every day. Whether it's lifting weights or just going on the elliptical, I want my child to stay active and not just sit around at home.

It seems a little strange but its helped me better my life considerably over the past month and I haven't smoked a cig since.

Let me know what you guys think about this. I couldn't be happier.

8 months, and staying strong. You can too!

(Half a pack to 15 a day. Started at 13, in my late 20's now)

I went cold turkey 8 months ago. I have passed the following tests:

1. Smoking after a meal
2. Smoking when out drinking
3. Smoking in Vegas
4. Smoking when camping
5. Smoking on a long road trip/or just a drive in general.
6. Smoking out of boredom
7. Smoking after a long flight
8. Smoking after work

After passing all these tests within 8 months, nothing can beat me. The only real way to quit, is cold turkey. You gotta beat yourself up and punish yourself for even smoking in the first place. When you do that, you become strong and can overpower the nicotine craving. Using patches, gum, or vapes will not help, and you are wasting money on another source of nicotine. 

Reflect on the money you are saving, reflect on the all the benefits you gain from quitting (such as smelling good, playing sports, getting in shape, etc...). 

Apparently cigarettes are supposed to smell bad after you quit, but they still smell so damn good. Do not let that deter you or even fool you because soap smells good but tastes like shit

If you want, you can make a list on Word or Note pad, or even write it out with a pen. This list should contain ALL the reasons why you want to quit and always remember that list. 

**You guys will be okay.**

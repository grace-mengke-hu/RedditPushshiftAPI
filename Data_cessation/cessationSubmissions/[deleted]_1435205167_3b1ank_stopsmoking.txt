New to the sub. Need to vent.

After years of hounding from friends and family, I've decided to stop smoking. On one hand, I'm happy to give it up. One less thing in my pocket, save some cash, increase health, won't always smell, no more nasty cough, etc. but on the other hand, I feel like I'm losing a friend. Cigarettes were my escape in anxiety filled moments, the perfect after meal treat, the perfect combo with a drink or a cup of coffee, a nice addition to a warm night on the front porch, a conversation starter, the list goes on. Smoking has been a part of my life for 10 years.

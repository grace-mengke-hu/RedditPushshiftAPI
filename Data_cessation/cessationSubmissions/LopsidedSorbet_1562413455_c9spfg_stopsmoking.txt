Major stress-induced craving

Yesterday evening I had the most stressful situation that I've faced in the 37 days of not smoking. My daughter is going through a very bad time and seeing her in so much pain got to me. I managed to not smoke though. I kept telling myself that cigarettes don't actually reduce stress. They will in no way make the situation better. Those were definitely the strongest cravings that I've had so I'm proud of myself for abstaining. We got this!!!

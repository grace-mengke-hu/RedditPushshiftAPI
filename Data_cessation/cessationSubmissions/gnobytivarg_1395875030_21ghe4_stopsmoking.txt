so its been eight days

Like the title says its been eight days since my last cig. Im 25 and have been smoking a pack a day for about 6 years. I am also an avid smoker of marry jane. wondering if anyone has any info on if my lungs will recover if im still smoking pot. i definitely want to quit cigs but i dont see myself without mj. on a side note my cravings are starting to get less severe and they only really happen when driving. One week down, rest of my life to go.

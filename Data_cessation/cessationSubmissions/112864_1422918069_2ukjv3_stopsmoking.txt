Are brand cigarettes really more toxic?

I'm not a smoker, and I've a strong phobia of breathing brand cigarettes (Marlboro and those other terrible manufacturers) smoke, but not e-cigs, marijuana, rolled-up cigarettes. In my mind, brand cigarettes apart from their strong, worrying and easily identifiable smell have an amazing toxicity, and the respiratory system is quite prone to let toxicity pass through. I've been worried for more than a year, vomiting after unintentional inhalations, being extremely skinny, then I've taken recently some decerebrating anti-psychotics treatment by injections for 6 months, after feeling too idiot with that treatment I've wanted to stop. Now I still need a simple, scientific answer to my phobia.

Do we lose minutes, hours of life, each time we breathe this smoke (whatever the loss of life expectancy is I can't bear the fact to lose it because of other's acts and not oneself)? Is it considerably more toxic than ingesting common food that contains also arsenic, maybe cyanide in small proportion, etc.. pesticides...? Is it considerably more toxic than other smokes? Or can our body support small dose of this high toxicity (say several unintentional breathes per day) and those small dose doesn't have a proportional destructive effect, but instead their effect would be cancelled under a certain level (that's what I try to convince myself, but it's doubtful)?

That's it for my phobia, I wish good things for all of you who stop smoking, that's probably a great gift you can do to yourself and people around

Long time lurker in this sub, I’ve seen quite a few people mention Allen Carr’s book. I was incredibly sceptical, but thought I’d give it a try. I finished it tonight and I’ve just smoked my last cigarette.

I can’t believe how positive I feel. I can’t wait to live my life as a non-smoker. Thanks to all the people who post here; there are probably hundreds (or more) of people who lurk like I did, are on the fence about quitting and so don’t contribute. You are motivating us more than you know!

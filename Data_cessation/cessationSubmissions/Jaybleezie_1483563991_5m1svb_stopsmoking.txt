Cracked on day 4 (advice please)

For whatever reason I thought it would be a good idea to stop smoking and start a sugar-free diet on New Years. 

I smoked for 6 years and it was a lot easier to go cold turkey than I thought for the first few days. Well days 4-5 of my sugar free diet says you get irrationally irritated because your body is craving sugar. Well between craving a smoke and sugar I totally cracked and I'm so mad at myself. 

I couldn't stand it anymore and bought a can of dip. So I'm sitting here writing this with my nicotine fix in my lip feeling good and relaxed temporarily, but very disappointed.

I guess I'm just posting this to vent, get support, and hear other stories.

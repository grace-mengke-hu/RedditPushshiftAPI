Second try

Hey ladies and gents,

after I broke up with my ex gf on march this year I've been fallen back into smoking for the stupid reason of taking the breakup stress away. I quit cold turkey before on oktober 2012. 

I'll plan my second try a little bit more carefully because I gained 22 pounds after my first time. I always had my fingers in my sweets and chocolate box or I ate more unhealthy food. 

Plus I recently startet to work out. Sooo my health plan is pretty intense for my future. I really appreciate your support and I wanted to thank you for the good words you brought last time. (I'm not a native english speaker so please excuse errors)

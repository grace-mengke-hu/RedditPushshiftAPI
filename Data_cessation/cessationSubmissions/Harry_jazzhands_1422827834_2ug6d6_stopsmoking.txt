Today

Hey guys and girls, today has been a long time coming for me! Like a lot of you I have been a long time smoker, I've been smoking a 30 pack a day  or two 50g pouches of tobacco a week for at least five years and before that maybe half that amount since I was 16. I'm 31 now. I was the kind of awful smoker that would light up straight after eating, getting into a car or after waking up in the middle of the night to pee. Yeah

I'm not a super strong will powered person, but I'm saving for something very very important to me, so j started taking champix 18 days ago (that's chantix for you stateside) I haven't had the willpower to actually put the lighter down until now.


Last night I smoked my last cigarette. Today I've been awake for four hours and I haven't had one, and I'm certainly not going to!

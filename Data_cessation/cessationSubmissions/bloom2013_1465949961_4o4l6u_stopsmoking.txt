I'm rationalizing. Help!! I need someone to slap some sense into me.

One smoke right now will set the timer back to cero, right? I can't have just one every day and eventually none?
I *know* this but I'm also thinking maybe quitting next month will be better because of a series of reasons.
Help!!!

Edit: I'm fine now. That was a very strong urge. I would have taken me no time to leave the cafeteria and smoke a cigarette outside. I'm very glad I didn't.

20minutes from Last smoke

Hello guys, i have been trying to quit smoking like 16 times this year. I threw away or gave to someone else my half left pack so many times, but always relapsed within a week even less. I remember back in a day like 4 years ago, i could go without smoking more than months easy. However i am kind of surprised that my brain is now rewired to need it more so i cant even go without it more than 3days.

I DO HAVE THIS FEELING SMOKING IS ENHANCING MY Learning or problem solving because i am doing my graduate degree and the amount of information that i have to retain is ridiculous because its my first semester of the program.

I AM WORRIED because of this, i need to perform better and see the smoking is a sort of enhancement for this. Also it might reduce some stress level. I know the feeling is actually coming from the filling the lack of dopamin from a few hours absence of nicotime in my body.

I EAT LIKE SHIT, HAS NO MOTIVATION FOR WORKOUT BECAUSE MY BODY JUST CANT GET UP IN THE MORNING WHILE I SMOKE HEAVY, I LOST SO MUCH WEIGHT. 

sorry for the caps guys i just so much hate smoking but at the same time i need those in my life.


I will try to come back every day without relapsing, write a short progress I make. I will stop smoking weed at the same time and start running tmw. I want my normal level of dopamin back and get used to it. 

Thanks guys have a great weekend and see you tomorrow

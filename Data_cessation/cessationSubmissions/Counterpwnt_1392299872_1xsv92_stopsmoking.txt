Can't convince myself to quit.

I have "stopped" smoking and successfully made it to day 6. It hasn't been easy, but I would argue it hasn't been impossible—obviously—because I'm on day 6.

Yet despite my success I don't feel like I've actually quit. I'm still daydreaming about cigarettes, I miss them, I feel no motivation to keep this up.

Is it impossible for me to quit if I feel like I don't want to?

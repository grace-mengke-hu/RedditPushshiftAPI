9 Months today, didn't plan it this way but it's my birthday too.

Ain't coincidence weird sometimes? It's almost like the end of a 2nd gestation period (I know it's not that big a deal, but I feel like an attempt at waxing poetic). 5,500 fags not smoked, $1787.50 not wasted, 1.27 months added to life expectancy. Oh, and this place helped enormously, thanks for being here.

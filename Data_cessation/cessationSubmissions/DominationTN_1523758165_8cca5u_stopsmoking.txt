I used smoking as a coping mechanism.

Got drunk tonight during the Raptors game.
Girlfriend took a run around the neighbor hood and I couldn’t find her. I also took a run. Either way I used smoking to cope after 22 days without a cig. Disappointed in myself but I know I can continue to quit from here. Only one left in the pack from when I started. When I quit there were 8 left to give myself a reminder. My roommate asked to borrow some before he went to basic and I was left with two. Now I’m down to 1 to remind myself. Just posting to reddit to keep myself in check. Thank you to anyone who reads this wall of text! We’ve got this and it’s possible! Keep striving and remember that bumps in the road are just bumps in the road.

Deep pain in arm with patch on. Day 1

Hi guys,

Sorry for asking a question that's been asked here before. I looked it up and found one or two posts on this but they didn't fully describe what I'm feeling.

This is my second time round using the patches. I successfully stopped smoking for about a year and a half the first time, and I didn't have any of the symptoms I'm having now, so I'm not sure if it's to do with te patch or not. Last time I had side effects mostly concerning skin irritation and burning.

I'm using 15mg 16 hour patche (Nicotette), on my upper left arm. I put it on this morning at about eight, and for the last few hours (it's now four in the afternoon) my shoulder has been really hurting me.

It's like a deep ache that's sort of radiating over my shoulder and down my shoulder blade and arm. It feels like someone's given me a good thump there, or like I've just had an injection. At first I thought it was just muscle pain (thanks for nothing, stress), but now I don't know. Oddly, the pain isn't over where the patch is. It's (the patch) half way between my shoulder and elbow on my outer arm.

Has anyone else had this? Most other places I've tried to look up discuss a burning of the skin rather than this deep ache. I'm trying not to worry, but you know how it is. I've been smoking much more recently which is why I've decided to cut it out once and for all. I'm also on the pill, which is another thing concerning me. I guess I'll go visit the chemist after work, but I wanted to ask here so I could see if anyone had any real-world experiences similar to mine!

Thanks in advance!

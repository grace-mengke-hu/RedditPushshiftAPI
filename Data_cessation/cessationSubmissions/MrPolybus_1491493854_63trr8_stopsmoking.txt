After 120 days I'm finally feeling cravings. Any advice?

So just hit 121 days without a smoke and feel great, I read Allen Carr's book and it honestly worked as the book said it would. Had tried quitting before after smoking for 5 years and I never managed, but after reading the book it has honestly been a breeze. However, just the past couple of days, probably due to stress surrounding my final few days of university, I have been getting really strong cravings. Any advice for how to deal with cravings this far along? Anyone else experienced their first set of real cravings this far on?

Experiences with regaining sense of smell/taste?

Almost into day three, and I haven't noticed entirely too much except that my breath is putrid -- which is just horrifying as I'm sure it was that way most of the time, but I'm only now becoming fully aware. 
Anyone else have any stories about their repairing senses, good or bad?

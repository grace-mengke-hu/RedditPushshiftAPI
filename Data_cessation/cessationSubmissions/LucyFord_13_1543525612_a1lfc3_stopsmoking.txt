It's my birthday and about damn time.

I've been smoking since I was 18 at about a pack a day but up to three for a period of a couple months. I have a daughter and I've hid it from her as best I can. I quit for over a year when I got pregnant with her, and several times subsequently after taking it back up again. I can't let my garbage can continue to be my black hole of shame. It ends tonight, 31 is going to be good to me. I'm going to be good to 31.

What is going to happen?

I posted earlier today about how I am done smoking. I didn't think it would be this hard, but so far so good! I also have health anxiety and was wondering, what kind of physical things/symptoms have you all experienced while quitting? When do they stop? Reading the posts in this sub have helped so much today, thanks everyone!

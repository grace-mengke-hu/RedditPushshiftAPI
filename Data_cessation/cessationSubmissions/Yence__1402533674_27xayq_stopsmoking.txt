Cravings caused by passive smoking?

Thank you all for the support here, reading in this subreddit has made me feel a lot better and more confident that I really want to quit. 

So far the most useful thing I've read on this subreddit is that "wether you have a cigarette or not, the cravings will go away - so you might just as well not have one"

I have smoked about 15 cigarettes a day for 5,5 years, I'm now 25. Have always said since I was 23 that I was going to quit on my 25th, so I did that now a few months after I turned 25.

I'm in for 7 days now and I'm feeling quite good about it. My taste and smell has improved, and I feel that I can breathe more easily. I am very lethargic though and caffein doesn't really work. Have changed to taking guarana to battle the constant tiredness and this seems to work better. I should eat more fruit though. Any tips on battling the constant tiredness (even after a long sleep) are welcome. So far I've read eat healthy and that it will pass.

I'm having about 10 moments of cravings per day, caused usually by:

* having coffee or beer

* having had a saturating meal

* waiting for the bus, also because there are usually other people smoking at the bus stop

* and most of all: **all my friends are smokers.**

And this last one makes it very hard sometimes, because every time I want to see them I'm exposed to their smoke and its scent. This causes a lot of cravings and I even think to myself "that smells really nice, wish I could have one". I don't want to have that thought.

My friends know that I quit, but I can't forbid them to smoke while we are outside or at their place.

So this is where I'm struggling the most. Although I have even been quite drunk a few days ago and said nonono to a cigarette someone offered me, I'm afraid that at a certain point this is where I won't be able to resist any longer.

Would like to know how other people that are often surrounded by smokers are dealing with these situations.

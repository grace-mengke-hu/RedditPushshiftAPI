Had a big fight with gf, I did not even think of cigarettes

So yeah, the fight is definitely not a good thing, and it may be kinda twisted of me to say so,  but this was something of a milestone for me. I mean, in tge past, back when I was smoking, I always ended up rushing out of the house to smoke heavily during arguments like this. And generally, I smoked heavily whenever I was angry or agitated. My way of dealing with such things was smoking. 

And, well, even though I did storm out of the house to cool off and pace around angrily, the thought of smoking did not even occur to me. So, yeah, maybe I'm still an asshole, and I'm crap at conflict resolution, but at least I did not smoke. I did not need the cigarettes at all. 

It's a bit like growing up: learning to manage emotions without cigarettes.

(a better man than me would make awesome puns about "fuming")

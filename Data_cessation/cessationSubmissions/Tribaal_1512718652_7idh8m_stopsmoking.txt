3000 days!

Once upon a time, in a galaxy far, far, away, my wife and I used to be rather heavy smokers.

We made it together. We got married. We scaled mountains (both literally and figuratively). We started running. We had kids. Quitting smoking impacted all of those events positively.

Quitting smoking was clearly one of the best decisions in our lives. It was hard, especially in the beginning. If you're just stopping now, it probably seems like an impossible task, but if you hang in there I can promise you won't regret it once the first few days are behind you.

As I keep saying to you all when I post once in a while, remember those cravings only last a few seconds. Just a few second of strength, then they are GONE.

You got this!

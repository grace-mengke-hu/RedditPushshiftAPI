Another month down since my last post. Dropping in for accountability

It's been 130 days. 130 days without the crutch. I still get a craving once every 10 days or so, but it's very, very mild. I'm resolved to be a non-smoker. I'm proud to be a quitter. Not one puff ever.

Cheers folks. I'm here for any and all of you.

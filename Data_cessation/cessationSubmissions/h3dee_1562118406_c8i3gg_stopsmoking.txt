App suggestions?

I have been using a quit smoking Android app I found on GitHub....  I like it because it's open so, and doesn't have any nasty unexpected software attached, but I don't like the way the app works. every time I have a smoke it wants me to make a diary entry, so I have this screen with dozens of entries on it, and I would prefer to be able to track my smoking a bit more intelligently, ie with graphs, so I can monitor my smoking more carefully. Does anyone have any suggestions on quitting apps that might work better for me?

I want to quit but I love smoking.

I quit during my pregnancy, then started again. I have been smoking again for 6 months, and I know all of the horrible effects on my health. I know it affects every part of my body in a catastrophic way, and I want to quit but I love smoking. 

I have been smoking since I was 11, it has been a part of my life and my identity all of these years. It's like a security blanket when I am sad, angry or stressed. It is an old friend when I am having a good time. I don't know how to change my own mind. I know in my heart I should quit, but I absolutely love smoking.

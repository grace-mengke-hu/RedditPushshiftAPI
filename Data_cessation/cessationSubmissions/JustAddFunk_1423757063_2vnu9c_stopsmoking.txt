A month gone and I didn't even know!

I was waiting for the 1 month badge as these little things make all the difference, having something to look forward too and all. Despite my excitement I completely forgot about smoking and quitting until just now, a few days after my full month. Cheers to all the quitters who no longer feel like quitters but just healthy people.

Makes it easier to make goals like, running or yoga or eating well, now that the biggest goal seems to have been tackled.

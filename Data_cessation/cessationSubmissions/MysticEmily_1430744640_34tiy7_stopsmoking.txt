Wondering about quitting ^^

Hello people. 

That's my first reddit topic. I must admit that i'm not feeling disciplined enough to quit smoking recently. Last time i did it.. i felt pain in my chest. :] It was after 2 months with cigarillos (sometimes 5/day). Before that i was not smoking few years and nothing was luring me to that, book helped me with that try (that best one about quitting). Lately depression got back to me. I wish to be strong enough to quit for real, but i'm waiting for other chest pains that could help me with my decission. I'm not worried about my health at all, earlier i was but i can't remember why. I'm 24 and very nervous person. That's it. ;]

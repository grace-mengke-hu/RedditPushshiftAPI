Literally can't afford to smoke this week, but so tempted to blow 7 bucks on a pack.

I've been planning on quitting cigarettes for a while now.  I had a really expensive car repair this week on top of paying rent, and I have 40 dollars to last me 10 days.  If I live frugally, I can probably get by on gas and food until I get paid.  However, I've still been on a pack a day habit as of yesterday.  I just smoked my last cigarette.  


I quit drinking at the end of last month and am around 2 weeks sober.  I was always afraid to quit cigarettes at the same time as alcohol, because I wanted to still have nicotine to lean on as I was getting sober.  I'm terrified I will have bad anxiety from nicotine withdrawal.  A part of me is so tempted to just spent 1/4 of what I have left on a pack and try to ration it...  


Idk, I guess I should just try to quit cold turkey I'm just scared.

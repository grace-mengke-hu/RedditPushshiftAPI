Tonight is a real struggle.

I smoked my last cigarette Saturday morning at 6 AM when I left work for a 3 day break... I returned to work tonight and just a little insight on my job... I work for 911 Dispatch from 6pm to 6am and it gets pretty quiet around this time and I am used to getting up every hour to have a smoke... Its really killing me and the craving wont go away... There arent enough sunflower seeds in the world....This subreddit is the only thing that might get me through this.... Im not sure why the cravings are hitting me so hard, it wasnt anywhere close to this bad the prior 3 days... It doesnt help that most my coworkers smoke... But im not going to give up, im loving the fact that I can still smell the laundry detergent from my shirt and the air fresheners in my truck.... Only 5 more hours and I can sleep and not think about smoking for a while!

2 Weeks but still something is missing

I am very happy that I finally stopped smoking, and I wont start again (the smell is disgusting by now) - but still something is still very different. I feel like I am not balanced anymore (I get angry and bored easily) 

But I think that will pass in the next few months (?) 

Anyways, here are some nice things about not smoking anymore: 

- I can actually smell my shampoo ... I know it sounds strange but it is nice having hair that doesn't smell like smoke

- I have a nicer taste in my mouth ... and generally I have not this disgusting feeling in my mouth after a party or a long night with a lot of cigs 

- my fingernails aren't yellow anymore 

- my skin is not that grey anymore 

- I generally look and feel better (except for being somewhat out of balance) 

And I finally don't miss anything when going on a party or having diner with my friends. I don't have to go outside to stand alone in the dark and smoke a cigarette. That is actually very nice. 

And I am having a little bit of more time ...

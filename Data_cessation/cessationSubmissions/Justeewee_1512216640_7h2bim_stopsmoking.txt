Dear Cigarettes

Day 2:
Dear cigarettes: You have been my faithful and loyal companion for a long time now. But our relationship is literally killing me. You take my breath away. You make my heart race. And you make me stink! Without you I can live happily ever after. So I am not at all sorry to say that it's curtains for you. I wish you well. Go and spread your toxic waste somewhere else. 
Goodbye and good riddance! 
Signed....

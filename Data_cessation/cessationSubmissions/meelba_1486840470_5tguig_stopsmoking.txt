Three days and eleven hours

I just updated my badge. I quit twice in 2015. I felt so solid about it both times. I want to be a non smoker but the nicotine keeps reeling me in. Today I saw a picture of Vanessa Paradis smoking and thought...doesn't she look chic? But, it doesn't matter because that's not me and I don't want to smoke. All of the things that I think hook me in, taking breaks, smoking on a patio on a warm day, taking a drive with a pack of cigs, they're all bullshit and it all comes down to nicotine and addiction. 

So I'm three days without smoking and almost two without nicotine. I used the losenge on my first day, and it helped me get through that day at work where almost all of my staff smokes. 

I am looking forward to using this sub and hearing others stories.

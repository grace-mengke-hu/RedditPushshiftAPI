I'm on Day 1

42 year old guy living in SE Asia. Tried to quit twice before, the longest it stuck was about 6 months. I'm hoping third time's the charm and I finally kick it.

Not really sure why I'm doing this. Just a vague sense of wanting to be healthier and maybe be around to watch more of my son's life. 

The cravings are coming in hard and fast now. Triggers are after meals and having coffee. I drink lots of water, do breathing exercises. Wish me luck.

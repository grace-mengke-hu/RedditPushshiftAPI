Addicted to the ritual rather than the nicotine.

I'm just curious if other people's addiction revolve around their day-to-day smoking rituals and habits rather than the actual nicotine. 

I've tried quitting via gum, patches, e-cigarettes...it's just not the same. I want my lungs to feel like shit or I'm just not satisfied.

Thoughts? Tips?

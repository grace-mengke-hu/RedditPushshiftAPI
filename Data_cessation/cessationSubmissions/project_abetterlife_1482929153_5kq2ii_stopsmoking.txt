Day 13 ongoing. Xmas was not easy and I really need to sleep, but at least I am still a non-smoker

Back to work after Xmas break. 

Xmas was stressful and I really had a lot of cravings. Distracted myself from them going to watch stupid videos online and ended up going to bed late (3-4 am) 4 days in a row. 

I can't focus at work now, I am tired. I am happy with not smoking even when there was a stupid, idiot fight between family members over a misunderstanding on Xmas. 

Now to keep being a nonsmoker and actually having healthy sleeping habits too :)

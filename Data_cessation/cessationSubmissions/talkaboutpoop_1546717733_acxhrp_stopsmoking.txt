A trip to the hospital is helping me quit!

So, long story short, I had to go to the hospital for a couple days because of a huge cyst that ruptured on my ovary. It was terrible! The only good thing that came of this was that I couldn’t smoke for the 3 days that I was in the hospital. When I got home, I tried to smoke but it made me feel really nauseous so I put it out and threw out my packs! Every now and then, I’ll crave one but I just keep reminding myself about how sick I felt. I hope I can keep it up!!

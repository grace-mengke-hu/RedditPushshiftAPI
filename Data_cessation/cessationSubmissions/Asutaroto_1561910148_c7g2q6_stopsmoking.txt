Quitting vaping and depression

I thought quitting vaping would be much easier than cigarettes. So the first 4 days were fine, but now I am a week down and am experiencing probably the most severe depression of my life. I literally feel like I'm dying, emotionally and spiritually. How long can I expect this to go on? I realize the brain has to rebalance dopamine, etc. Am I through the worst of it or is this going to go on for weeks?

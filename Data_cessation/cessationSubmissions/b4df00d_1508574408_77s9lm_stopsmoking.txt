Serious attempt #4. 35 y/o. I don't want my life to be about figthing addictions or living with them.

I've tried quitting before, never made it past 6-7 months. It was always alcohol/parties involved in relapses. I no longer do that much, so should be easier this time. 

Self reminder: Any time you try to think about how cool it would be again to go out to your balcony and have a cig, look around and think... Remember how you choked when inhaling that thing. Remeber not smelling the fall or the spring. It was always the break that you enjoyed to compose yourself, not the stink. And remember when you'll eventually try to quit again you will have to come up with more bad rhymes.

My 22 days smoke free.

Hi, I had posted before when i reached 10 days, I am 25 years old, smoked for 10 years on average about 15 a day and god knows then at the weekends when I was drinking. I have made it to 22 days with the gum, 10 days the patches and sheer willpower. 

I have experienced every withdrawal going - depression, anxiety, dreaming about smoking, anger, sweating, bad coughing and one point I actually felt like crying because I was 'suffering' that bad. However, the times I have not been experiencing anything like this I feel incredible, seriously I can't believe the way I used to feel I thought was normal. I have so much more energy, I look far better, my teeth are whiter everyday and when am not having withdrawal symptoms my happiness and morale about my life is something I have not felt before. I am full of hope and joy with no particular reason to be (nothing much has changed!) but I just feel great. 

What I am trying to say is, I have heard about the benefits and I know the dangers of smoking but for those trying to quit and want to quit, the positives when you actually do I don't feel people can not do it justice, you have to experience it yourself I think. As each day goes on now I am getting stronger and more determined to make sure this effort and strength I have shown is not in vain. (Yes the withdrawal's are becoming weaker). 

Also, I have been on three nights out drunk in that time and the guilt of caving has made me have the strength of not caving in and when I woke in the mornings of my nights out I was overwhelmed with pride in myself. I have discovered I have the strength and I think it can be a real positive for other aspects in your life too. 

This board has been an incredible help for me and I wanted to just give something back to others here with this message! Lets keep it going everyone, excuse the language but FUCK smoking!!

My biggest struggle

For the past few months I have tried to quit smoking. At night I will take a 3 to 4 mile walk smoke as many cigarettes as I can until I get home. Then I ceremoniously rip the rest in half and throw my lighter into the bushes. I will be so excited and ready to begin my future as a smoke free man. And then morning comes... this is where I mess up EVERY SINGLE TIME. I wake up and tell myself I will not smoke but I end up losing the battle with my mind and go buy cigarettes anyways. This confuses me because to most it may seem like I’m not serious about quiting. But I really do want to. I just got accepted into nursing school and absolutely can not be the “smoker”. For the love of biscuits and gravy can anyone give me tips on how to stop this madness?

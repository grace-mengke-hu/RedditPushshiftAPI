Upvote to Ban karmawhores: "for every upvote I wont smoke however many days"

I made this account just to post this.  Kick these people out of here.  They probably don't even smoke.  And if they do, they more than likely have very little drive to quit.  They're only using us for karma and that's annoying.  

I didn't post this on my main account because  I don't want to be a karma whore, but want this post to be seen.  Message the Mods please and ask them to be good about deleting these karmawhore posts.

Words of wisdom?

I’ve posted here before with a cold turkey quit, was sooo determined but caved in after 10 days after hideous mood swings. Honestly, I just cried and smoking was all I could think about.
So, the new quit date was Monday just gone. My husband and I actually got some help through the nhs stop smoking service and are both trying NRT - both patches, him with spray and me with lozenges.
To be honest, the bits I’d thought I’d struggle with like driving and work breaks are ok, but I caved last night and had one cigarette because we still had half a pouch of tobacco in the house. I really struggled today and came home and reached for the dusty dry baccy again. 
The worst thing is that I suggested a cigarette and my husband didn’t put up any fight (as I wouldn’t the other way around!) and so I feel like I’ve kind of sabotaged his quit attempt too.
We’ve made a promise that we won’t buy anymore. Going back on Saturday for our next appointment and am going to be honest obviously- I so desperately want to stop but my willpower is weaker than the addiction right now. I honestly don’t know how people do it. 
Has anyone got any advice about quitting with a partner? And any general words of wisdom would be greatly appreciated! Thanks

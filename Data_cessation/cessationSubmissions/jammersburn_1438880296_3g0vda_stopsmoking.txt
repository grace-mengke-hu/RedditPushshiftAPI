Ex-Smoker's Dreams

Do you all ever have dreams where you've suddenly smoked again? I still get them from time-to-time. I'm smoking in my dream and I realize what I've done and my smoke-free streak is gone. That panicked feeling! I think it actually helps me continue to quit every day, knowing what smoking again would feel like.

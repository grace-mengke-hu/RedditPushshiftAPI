"Stop and think the next time you're gonna smoke"

Some days are better than others. Yesterday was a hard one, but I didn't even think about smoking, rather I Didn't get a craving, even when others around me were smoking :D I'm happy about that. 

Instead today I get a craving! How weird? maybe my brain is just drifting away and not being used to be constructive.. so kind of not focused on anything in particular. I may be taking that as a moment , rather it was my previous moments, when I did smoke. So its one of those triggers I guess. 

My feet and calf muscles are bit tingling, I've read that's my nerves working better :D

I wrote this while watching 'Goliath' and heard this dialogue : "Stop and think the next time you're going to drink." so i adapted it for this post and made it a title :P erm... does not have the ring to it though. Meh.

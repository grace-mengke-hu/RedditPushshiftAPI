I'm a non smoker successfully for 3 days and counting now and I cried like a baby over a bag of chips!

It's what the title says, I cried over a bag of chips because I didn't get the exact one I wanted.
Then I cried again when I had to refill the bottle with water because I was thirsty and wanted water immideately.
I also cried because it's so hot among other things

But I survived, not only did I survive, I freaking burned the monster down
I know I'm done, this time I just know I won't ever be a smoker again and it's OKAY to cry, so cry I will! Hang in there folks!

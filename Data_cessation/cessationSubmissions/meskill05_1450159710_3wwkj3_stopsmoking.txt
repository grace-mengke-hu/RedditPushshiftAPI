8 weeks tomorrow

Beat another trigger today, anger! Was very angry at work today ,was standing outside venting to a co-worker not 1 but 2 co-workers who were both smoking,  and it honestly didn't even phase me! Smelled kinda good, but had no urge to want to bum one, and it could have been so easy! Very proud of myself for working through the anger without turning to smoking!

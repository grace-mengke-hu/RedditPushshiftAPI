Day 3 smoke free Day 20 on Chantix

Things are going prettttty well! I stopped smoking three days ago but for two days before then cigarettes literally were the worst tasting thing ever. Barely a puff off each cigarette I lit buy still lit plenty of them. Until 3 days ago when I finally said “okay I’m waking up tomorrow and not smoking.” 

Cravings are okay. I had a high stress situation today with my kid and I ended up handling it better than I thought I would and only obsessed about smoking for five minutes before it went away. 

I will say I am constantly having a feeling of anxiety. I do struggle with some general anxiety and am on Zoloft to help with that but it’s like, just a constant ball of anxiety in my chest now. Don’t know if that’s the Chantix, quitting in general, or what. Other than the maybe anxiety and very mild nausea I’ve had no bad reactions to Chantix and I honestly believe it has made this (final) quit so easy for me.

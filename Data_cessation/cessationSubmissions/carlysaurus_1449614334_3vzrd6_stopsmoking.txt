Still having trouble not feeling "deprived" after a week

Hey guys, I've made it a whole week. Big thanks to everyone who's been posting their own stories and responding to mine. 

The really cool thing is that my physical cravings are practically gone. I could tell the morning I woke up after day 3 and the nicotine was just...not in my head anymore. That has made quitting a lot easier. Even the more habit-oriented cravings are gone. I went to a friendsgiving party over the weekend, we all got totally wasted drunk, but I didn't even really want to smoke.

HOWEVER. I feel like I'm missing out on smoking. I know the prevailing logic around here is that smoking is not something that one enjoys...but how can that be? I liked doing it. It only occasionally felt like a burden that I wanted to be rid of.

How can I get to the mindset that stopping smoking is not depriving me of pleasure?

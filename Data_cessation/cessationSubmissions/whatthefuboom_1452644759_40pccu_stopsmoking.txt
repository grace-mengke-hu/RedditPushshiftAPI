No eCig, no problem

I had quit smoking in June or July. I lasted about three weeks. It was painful. 

On the 5th of January, I bought an eRoll electronic cigarette. Haven't smoked a real cigarette since. 

Yesterday, I read Allen Carr's book. I regretted even buying the god damn vaporizer, because I got it mainly for the fact that it would feed me nicotine. Carr made me realize that I needed to stop being a nicotine addict altogether. 

I forgot my ecig in my friend's car last night. Haven't vaped since then, and decided that I will never vape again either. It's been nearly 20 hours. I felt great this morning, and I started my new semester at school. Went out for coffee with classmates after. Jesus. I had never craved that hard before. I felt borderline insane for about an hour. I was dazed. 

I took an hour-long walk after school was done. I've been feeling great ever since. Not looking forward to the next cravings, but there's no reason to keep smoking. This will be easier than I expected, I hope. The first day's been going swimmingly.

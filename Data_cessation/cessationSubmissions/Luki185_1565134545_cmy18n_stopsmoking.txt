Quitting this week.. But I have a problem..

Hello dear redditors!
I can see a lot of ex-smokers here, supporting each other and that's just wonderful! I need an advice so I thought I would ask here..
So here's the thing, a few weeks ago I got myself a brand new, fresh cartoon of cigarettes. 10 packs, with 20 killers inside each pack. Yesterday I finally decided to stop, after many tries, but I still have 2 packs left. I seriously want to quit, mainly because of that awful smell (and because I'm trying to save money for a new car ðŸ¤ž)
So my question is: what should I do with those 2 remaining packs? Would be kinda stupid to throw them out (because cigarettes here in Eu are quite expensive), but then again I don't know if I want to smoke them..
I seriously need help and I hope you can help me.
Cheers, and thanks in advance!

What's kept me smoke-free for over 13 years now.

Hey everyone.  Just for a bit of context, I started smoking when I was fifteen, and averaged about a pack a day.  I quit on January 1, 2005, and I haven't gone back since. 

I don't know if anyone knows about this book or not, but reading Allen Carr's Easy Way to Quit Smoking was a total lifesaver.  

I would caution that it still takes willpower, and there are still times when I want a cigarette, but overall, quitting smoking was the best thing that I've done for myself, easy. 

If you've never heard of the book, you should check it out!  Hopefully this will help someone!

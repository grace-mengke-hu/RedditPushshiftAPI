Commitment

I’m 22, smoking since I was 13. I quit smoking a few months ago, for a whole month. Then I relapsed. Now I am at a kinesiology seminar and today we were asked what do we chose to do when we leave the room. I said I choose to never smoke again. My last cigarette was yesterday at 07:00 AM. 
Now I’m committing in front of Reddit.
I choose to be free, and give my body the respect and care it deserves. 
I chose to never smoke again.
Wish me luck!

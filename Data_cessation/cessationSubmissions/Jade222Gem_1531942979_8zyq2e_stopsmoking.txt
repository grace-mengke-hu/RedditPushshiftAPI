In 9 days time it will be 1 Year since I quit smoking. And then last night I had a cigarette.


There wasn't any reason to have it, I wasn't craving or anything, and it was a roll-up cigarette, not even a proper cigarette.   I had no idea why I was smoking it.  

And then someone came in and caught me smoking it and this made me suddenly shocked to be having a cigarette after nearly a year.

Then I woke up.   It was the weirdest dream ever.   I really thought that I had had a cigarette, it all seemed so real.

I'm so glad it was only a dream.

For those just starting out, I can only say that it gets easier and easier as time goes on.    I haven't had any cravings now for the whole of this year and I had been smoking for decades.

Just hang on in there through the tough bits and the days, weeks, months will start to fly.

It seems incredible to me that I've got to nearly a year and apart from the very early days it hasn't been too bad at all.

Good luck everyone, you can do it.

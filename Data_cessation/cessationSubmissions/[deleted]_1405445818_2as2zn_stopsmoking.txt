100 hours ago I threw my last pack of smokes into the trash.

I got this. Sometimes you know when something is just going to stick. I'm just over the whole thing. Done doing damage to myself. It's really quite silly if you think about it. Just done with that scene maaaaan! I want 100 days. 100 months! More!

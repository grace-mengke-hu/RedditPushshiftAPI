Has it really been 19 days?!

My fellow New Year's Day Class of 2016 folks: Can you believe tomorrow will be twenty smoke-free days?! I walked up a giant hill today and my legs started to burn before my lungs did. That's progress! I'm proud of all of you, and if you haven't started the journey yet, you can do it -- I'm rooting for you!

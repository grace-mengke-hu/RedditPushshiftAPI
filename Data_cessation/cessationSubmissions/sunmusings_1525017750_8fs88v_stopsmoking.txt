Any people who quit on here while having a developmental trauma/complex trauma disorder?

I am very scared to try to quit again. I've tried multiple times and it always goes incredibly badly - emotionally. Physically, it's not so terrible and is definitely doable. But emotionally it's a total disaster. I am emotionally dysregulated and working through childhood trauma issues and am already not so greatly balanced emotionally.

I quit smoking and it all gets much worse. The longest I've made it no smoking was two weeks.  It was horrible the entire time.  

Anyone on here quit with having this particular issue? Because it's not like when people don't have it and they go "oh everyone is off-balance when they quit". I'm talking about how quitting smoking causes me to get more flashbacks, have panic attacks, and shake in a corner for hours in a day.  

I feel like I've suffered enough and smoking is the only thing that takes the edge off and I don't deserve to suffer even more than I already have from quitting.  

I don't even want to quit for health reasons, I don't care.  It's the materialism and vanity that drives me to quit.  I'd rather buy shoes than cigarettes, I stink, I can't wear my perfumes because the stink covers their scents, and my once-young pretty face looks old and haggard now.  These are the reasons I want to quit but it's just so awful when I quit and nothing helps. There is no trauma-pill to take.

I need your help guys! Cravings are really bad right now.

I quit nicotine altogether 2 weeks ago and I'm really struggling to not pick up a cigarette or e-cig to have a nicotine dose right now. 
I was sick and am now very left behind in my college courses and have a danger of dropping out...... I have massive amounts of fines waiting their monthly payment and I know I have to take a loan to pay them..... relationship with my girlfriend isn't the best and we are in the brink of a breakup.... Depression is strangling again.... It's funny that while in midst of quitting all these things suddenly create a huge amount of stress, almost unbearable. So here I am sitting, thinking if I should give in and smoke just this 1 cig just to ease all this pain. Feeling really desperate... What should I do guys?!

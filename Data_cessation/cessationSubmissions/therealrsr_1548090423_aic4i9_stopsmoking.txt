I'm late to this sub

I can't believe I never thought about a stop smoking sub before.  I smoked my last cigarette on June 14th of 2018.  I was a smoker for \~35 years.  I use a nicotine vape to help me get off them but now I want to get off that as well.  I tried over the weekend to strictly limit the use of the vape AND THE DAMN CRAVINGS CAME FLOODING BACK!  Any encouragement, ideas, success stories are appreciated.  I don't think I will give in to the urges but it scares me. 

To anyone here thinking about doing it or trying it I wish you the very best and encourage you to do it for yourself and your loved ones.

Incredible cravings after 1.5 years smoke free

Hey guys, I’m hoping someone here could have some advice for me. Or maybe I just need to type this out idk. I’m 31, and smoked from the 16 to 30. I quit one and a half years ago cold turkey. I was exercising a lot at the time and losing weight, and it just felt so wrong to finish a 30 minute run or a weight lighting session and then immediately sit down outside and light up a cigarette. 

Well, fast forward to now, and I’m having these crazy cravings. It’s like all I can think about are the good times smoking, and I feel like I’m missing out by not smoking. I objectively know this is not true, but my emotions don’t agree!

The past week it seems I’m constantly flooded with weird smoking nostalgia. I remember waking up on my day off work, going out on the back deck and sitting in the sunshine while smoking a cigarette. I remember how much more I looked forward to driving somewhere when it meant I could smoke on the way. I remember bingeing shows on Netflix, going outside to smoke between episodes and thinking about the cool things that I just saw, and wondering what would happen next.
 
I keep having these kind of thoughts, and thinking that things would be so much better if I still smoked. That I would be enjoying my life so much more. Obviously I’m aware of the negative health impact of smoking, and I try to reason with myself by thinking about that, but then I slip into thinking “but what’s the point of living longer if I don’t even enjoy it.”

Honestly the only thing that’s keeping me from going to buy a pack right now is my family. I own a house with 2 of my brothers, so I wouldn’t really be able to hide smoking again. They would be so disappointed in me.

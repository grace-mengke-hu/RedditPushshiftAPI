I smoked last night

I smoked last night. Not one, not two, but at least five cigarettes. I lost count after that. I remember the shame, the disgust, and the horrible taste. The realisation that I'd have to go through withdrawal again. I've never been more disappointed in myself.  
And then I woke up. It was but a dream. And even in my dreams I was disgusted with smoking. Never been more happy to wake up, even compared to the vivid nightmares I had a few weeks ago, this was worse. This was my worst nightmare. But it was just that. A dream. A nightmare. Never another cigarette for me.

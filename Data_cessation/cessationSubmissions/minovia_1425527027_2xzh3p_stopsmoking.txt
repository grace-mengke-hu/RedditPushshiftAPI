Did I accidentally ruin my quit?

I'll be brief, I just got to thinking that I may have actually ruined my quit. I have not smoked a single cigarette since new years, and I plan to keep it that way. But I did have a couple puffs of my friends hookah yesterday and am now worried about what it means for my quit.

I don't feel any worse cravings than the few occasional ones I've been having, and I still shrug them off easily and sometimes go a day or two without a thought about smoking. I am asking for people's opinions on the subject of resetting for any amount of nicotine no matter how small.

I appreciate honest feedback. I feel like I am still on my quit, and will continue to never smoke again, but I would like to know what you all think.

Thank you for the amazing support I could not have gotten this ar without this community :)

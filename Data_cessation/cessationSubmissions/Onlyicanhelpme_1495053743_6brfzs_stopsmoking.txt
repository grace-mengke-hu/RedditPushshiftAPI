My diary

Im 18 and for the last two years i have been smoking. 

I used to look down on people who smoked, i thought how stupid they must be to fuck up their health whit this stupid drug. But in the end i became one of those people.

I tried quitting countless times, but i didnt give it any effort. But today will be the last day i ever smoked.

I will use this thread as a diary and i will log my progress for the following 90 days.

My last cigarette will be in two hours.

It is my last one from my pack and I plan on having it on the way home from work. It is a beautiful day out. I have to roll the windows down, turn up the music and enjoy my last smoke.


Getting through work today without one has been brutal but in two hours I take control of my life and hopefully will not look back. I've turned over a new leaf and lifestyle. Have started going to the gym daily and I want to dedicate myself to healthy living.

I am 26yrs old and have been smoking for 11yrs. It's been long enough. Hopefully with the support in here and friends I can stay strong!

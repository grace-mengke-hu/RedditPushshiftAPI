Day one.

I've been smoking since I was 18 years old (11 years now). I have quit for very short periods of time in the past. The longest I quit before was 4 months, I felt amazing, could breathe great, and coughing felt foreign. I told myself I would never smoke again and couldn't believe I used to poison my body like that. Well, here I go, today is day one. I smoked my last cigarette 12 hours ago, and I decided I am done. I am feeling pretty good about today, but I know the first few days are the hardest for me.

**Update:** 5 days!!
I still have not smoked. I'm very proud of myself. It has actually been pretty easy, because I have decided I am not going to smoke anymore, when I get a craving it's like smoking isn't an option, so it quickly goes away. 5 days!!

First time quitting after 10 years! Some questions, too

So on Saturday, I was talking with my fianc√©e about quitting smoking, and how I kept making excuses and pushing back the day I was going to quit. So, Saturday afternoon, I had what I hope is my last cigarette. I was a ~pack a day smoker for over 10 years, and I was really tired of it. So, I bit the bullet and quit cold turkey.

Saturday was okay, Sunday I was a grump and not fun to be around. Sunday night, not much sleep. Monday I worked from home since I didn't sleep much. I was in a total mental fog until this morning, and it's still there just a little bit. 

I am taking the cravings how I take my anxiety: I accept the way I am feeling, acknowledge it, and then continue on with what I was doing. So far the cravings haven't been too bad.

How are things going to look moving forward? I start a new job on Monday and don't want to be a mental mess when I start. I'm already feeling a bit better, and I can smell the smoke on some of my things (I'm buying myself a new bag as a quitting gift, if you will. I've had it for years and it smells).

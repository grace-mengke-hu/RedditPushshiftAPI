Day 37 and first cup of coffee since; jonesing hard. How to deal?

Been smoking since I was 13 (26 Now). This is my most successful attempt since I was 16 and I stopped for about a year. I've felt that it has been necessary to avoid all stimulants (have been able to have alcohol) in order to get this far but I have an exam tomorrow and wanted to hunker down to study and finally grabbed some coffee. The 2 used to go hand in hand for me and I am feeling struck by a nic fit. This post is almost just an excuse to distract myself, but now I can't focus, which sucks. Anyone been in a similar situation? Should I stop drinking coffee forever?

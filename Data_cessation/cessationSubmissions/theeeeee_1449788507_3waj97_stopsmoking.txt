I forgot my old habits after a long vacation

So i just found this sub after almost 40 days of not smoking. I smoked my last cigarette entering the airport in Bangkok. And only two-three drags then thought "fuck it, if I'm gonna stop I don't have to smoke this one".

For me to quit was a long build-up. I went on a 2.5 month trip with my girlfriend around SE Asia. And there I really did smoke a hell of a lot of cigarettes. Dirt cheap and you can smoke them anywhere. But I also started noticing how often I smoked because that's what I do when I wait for the bus/drink a beer etc. Add to that the amount of times I smoked just to get rid of the cravings so that I once again could focus. Everything I did was always interrupted with cravings.

So during those 2.5 months i really made the decision. It helped too, that the first 2 days were spent on planes and jet-lagged in my bed. Now what really helped the most for me was the fact that when I got home I had "lost" all my old habits. Like standing on the porch drinking coffee after dinner - a usual smoking routine. So i formed new habits, and none included smoking.

 Sorry for the wall of text! And nice to know I'm not alone, really wanted to share!

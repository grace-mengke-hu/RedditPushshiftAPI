Is quitting a lifelong journey or is there a day when you dont need to hustle not to smoke?

Hey guys, first time here. I have stopped smoking for almost 2 weeks now with the help of nicotine gums. However, I know that this is too early to call my self a non smoker. So after reading here about people who go back after years of quitting, I have this question... Am I gonna be trying to avoid the urge for the rest of my life?

Heartburn after quitting? 12 days into my journey...

I'm just curious if anyone else experienced this sensation. I actually started noticing a couple of months ago that I was getting heartburn for the first time in my life (I'm an overweight smoker, f, 22) and that something had to be done. I've been a smoker since I was 15 years old, so 7 years at about 10-20 a day. My doctor told me I had to lose weight and seemed to think that it would be impossible for me to quit smoking. She told me that it was a large contributing factor, as well, but that it might be easier to lose the weight.

Needless to say, I'm on day 12 since my last cigarette. I can taste and smell things again. But starting about day 5, I've had a pretty constant bout of heartburn. It's not the worse I've ever had, but it's persistent and it won't go away. I'm getting nervous that it won't. I'm just wondering if anyone else has experienced this as an effect of quitting, or am I alone and dysfunctional?

Thanks for your advice/support/stories.

Who here was able to quit with nicotine gum / lozenges (nicorette)?

Ignore the flair.

I have tried quitting so many times. Sometimes it lasts for months, sometimes days. What usually does me in is a stressful day, drinking with my friends, or even boredom. I've only ever tried quitting cold turkey and with e-cigarettes. 

I'm considering trying the gum instead. I worry that it keeps the nicotine addiction going, but then again it seems the plan is to reduce the dosage every few weeks until you're not using it any more. I feel like if I can just get through a few weeks of breaking the habits and connections between behaviors / triggers and lighting one up, then I can focus on the nicotine dependency reduction.

I tried the search function but there aren't many positive stories. Not sure if that's accurate or just selection bias; I mean shit, the quit smoking app on my phone claims NRT quitters have a higher success rate than cold turkey.

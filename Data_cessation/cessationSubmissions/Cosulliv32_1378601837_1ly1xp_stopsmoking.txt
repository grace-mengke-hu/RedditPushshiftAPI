Thanks to you guys.

This is going to come across as weird, and I apologize in advance, but here goes nothing.

 Today at midnight marks my 50 day mark of quitting smoking!!!

It was hard, and I am terrible with emotions and "talking about things." This made it tough to express how I was feeling when I quit smoking, none of my friends smoke, or my GF. So literally no one understood. I would get so frustrated and think about smoking, then I would come here. Read success story's, tips and happy thought. I also rear, Read Allen carrs books" a lot. But here is to you guys. I didn't post often buy just lurking here completely turned my life around, and I feel great.

Day 6. Haven’t pooped in five days :(

Hi everyone!

First time poster, long time lurker. Pack a day smoker since 16, I’m 23 now. I once quit completely for two years from 20-22 years old, only to start back up again this year. Ugh.

Anyway, I’ve been using the patch to taper off and it’s going surprisingly well. BUT, I can’t poop :( I’ve never have constipation problems before this, and I eat lots of vegetables.

Did anyone else experience this?

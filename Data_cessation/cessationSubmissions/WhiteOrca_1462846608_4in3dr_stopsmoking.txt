I'm drunk at a party and all I can think about is how much I do not want a cigarette

I smoke the most when I drink. I'm at a party and everyone is smoking around me.  This is the first time in my life where I've been in this situation and I didn't want to smoke.  It feels weird, but good.


Edit: thank you all for the responses, I'm still in the early stages of quitting.  I ran out of cigarettes a couple days ago and I told myself that I wasn't going to buy any more, but I feel like this was a great step towards being free from nicotine

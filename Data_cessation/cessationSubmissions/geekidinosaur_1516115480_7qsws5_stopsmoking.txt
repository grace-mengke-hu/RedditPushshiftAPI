How am I going to make it through Day 1?

I lost my Dad to an aggressive lung cancer a year ago. He was diagnosed after a lifetime of smoking and in five weeks he was gone. He was only 58. Despite knowing the pain his loss caused and not wanting to put my family through that again, I continued to smoke for an entire year.

So a year later and with the support of my awesome boyfriend, I put the patch on this morning. Even though I know I am getting a steady dose of nicotine, all I can think about right now is going to the store to buy cigarettes. 

I know the first few days are the worst. But right now I don't know how I am going to make it through the next hour, let alone the first day. 

I would very much appreciate any advice. If I make it through today, I will count that a victory. I really want to kick this habit that my Dad never could. Thank you in advance!

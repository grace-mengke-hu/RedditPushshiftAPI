10 Days In and It really sucks!

After nearly 32 years of smoking and several miserable failed attempts of quitting, I am now in my 10th day of no smoking. And I'm happy to report I have killed no one and my dog still loves me. I am using a patch. Most definitely helps. I realized half way thru this morning, I forgot to put a new patch on. I felt successful, altho only momentarily! Why o Why is day 9 and 10 worse than the first 8? Nothing really changed. No more stress today than any other day. I came very close to hitting my neighbor up for just one! I talked myself out of it and decided to post instead. My motivation? Disappointing my children...to be honest. I don't want to tell them I broke down. I don't want to admit that I failed to quit...again. So here I am posting instead.  I know my children love me regardless. My daughter, who is 26, told me just today how proud she is of me. Going thru menopause AND quitting at the same time. Talk about throwing your body and mind into a tail spin! This sucks! Thanks all for hearing me out. It helps! Peace and ease to all who are quitting. May it be your last time forever!

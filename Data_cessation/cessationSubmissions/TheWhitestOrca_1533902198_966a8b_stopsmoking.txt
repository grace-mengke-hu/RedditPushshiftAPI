I’m struggling to quit while living with a smoker

I stopped buying cigarettes a week ago, but my mom still smokes, and she regularly only smokes half a cigarette and leaves the other half in the ash tray to be thrown away.  I just haven’t been able to resist the temptation.  I smoke the garbage halfies.  I justify it because they’re going to be thrown away anyways, but it still feels like stealing and I feel horrible about it.  I want to resist the urge.  It’s just hard.  At least I’ve gone from smoking 6-8 cigarettes a day to the equivalent of 2 a day.

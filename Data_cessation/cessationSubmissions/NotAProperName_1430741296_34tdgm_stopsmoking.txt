100!

Big symbolic milestone for me. I quit 100 days ago. Used a vape at  6 mg/ml for a couple of months, then used a mix of 6 and 0 mg/ml for a month, and then nothing (not even 0 mg/ml) for the last 2 weeks or so.
I still get the occasional cravings, but I plan to make it to one year for the next big milestone. See you guys in 265 days!

3 years!

Today is my 3 years anniversary. I never thought I could make it. I struggled for so many years, and have more failed attempts under my belt then I care to admit, but somehow, I finally realised that it was something I wanted enough to get to the other side. I thank whyquit.com and you guys for helping me through the toughest days and for always reminding me, that it is worth it, no matter what my brain was trying to tell me. I feel FREE!

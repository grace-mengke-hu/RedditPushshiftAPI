Withdrawal

I’m 19, and I smoked cigarettes for two years (only ever as much as four cigs per day MAX) before switching to vaping. I started with a regular SMOK vape- low nicotine levels, and when Juuls got popular, I joined in. Then, I got a Sourin. Then another. Over $500 I’ve spent on pod systems, salt nic juice, and cartridges. I recently had the Lost Vape Orion- I lost it, bought another one and lost it again- I took this as a sign to stop consuming nicotine, but the withdrawal has been horrendous. It scares me. I went from vaping heavy every ten minutes every day to nothing. I bought a disposable with 800 puffs. I’ve been going by hours. First 3 hours, then 6, 9, 12, 15, 17, 21, 24. The longest I’ve made it is 24 hours. I did just fine with 24 hours, but right now I’m at about 20 and I’m so irritated, my head is killing me, I’m anxious as hell, and I just want to go out and buy another vape but I know it’s an endless cycle. My boyfriend quit nicotine but his withdrawals weren’t bad so he can’t really relate, and my best friend still vapes and doesn’t want to quit, but is encouraging me to quit, and it’s so difficult. Hopefully someone out there will take the time to read this and give me any advice. I already deal with mental illnesses on top of this and I’m at a tipping point.

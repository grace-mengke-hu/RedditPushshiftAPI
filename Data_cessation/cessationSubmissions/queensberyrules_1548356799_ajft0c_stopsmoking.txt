reddit cake day, 82 days in, i dont get anymore cravings

hey all you fresh lungs out there. just wanted to check in and it happens to be my reddit anniversary, thanks to reddit and this sub i am able to go 82 days not one puff. honestly, this long i dont even think about it and i think its time for me and this sub to part ways for while. food tastes better, increased energy, more relax individual overall. i wish all you good luck and ill see you in one year :)

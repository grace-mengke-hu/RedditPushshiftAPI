The last I "try" to quit smoking

Everyday for the past few weeks I've been smoking non-stop. I had previously quit. I was 4 months without a single cigg, working out, meditating and yoga helped me beat the cravings. As soon as my girlfriend broke up with me I relapsed into smoking again and thought Id never quit. As time goes on the will to quit smoking arrives again, I start to have persistent thoughts every time I smoked. Now I'm quitting for the 10th time and really don't want to pick it up again. I want to start a fitness plan, but I have no clue about where to start to be fit and healthy. Id like to get a fitness coach. Anyone has any suggestions of what kind of routine I can do for fitness, meditation, or yoga? Just need assistance to help beat the cravings and I believe that routine is a really good way, you know, replace a bad habit with a good one.

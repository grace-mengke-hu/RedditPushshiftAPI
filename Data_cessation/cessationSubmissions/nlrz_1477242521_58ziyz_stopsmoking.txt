Chantix - need information from people who used it to quit

My BF and I are both currently on chantix. I started a day after he did. We're a week in. He has already stopped smoking entirely. I, on the other hand, haven't even cut back. I set a quit date of Nov. 1st. He thinks I should be weaning myself off slowly till then. I'm not sure how to proceed. What exactly is Chantix meant to do? I mean in a tangible sense. Are my cravings going to weaken, or will cigarettes start to taste bad? I feel no difference at all from taking the medication. 
So, has anyone here felt the same way, but been able to quit during the first month on chantix? Was there a point during the starter pack where you simply didn't want to smoke anymore, either because smoking was unpleasant or your cravings were better controlled? 
I'm already feeling like a failure :(

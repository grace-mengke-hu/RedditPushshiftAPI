Quitting is hard

Especially when doing it alone. No one knows that I smoked. My mom had some suspicions but I always denied it. I kept air freshener with me and doused myself in it to mask the odor. My SO thought I quit a while ago and I hated myself for keeping this secret from him. The only person who really knew that I smoked was my best friend. Now that I have made the decision to quit, I feel like this subreddit is the only outlet I have to documenting my progression of cessation.

I slipped and need advice

So, I just messed up. I smoked today after three weeks. I quit three weeks ago for the third fourth time and convinced my roommate to do the same. He relapsed about a week ago and is smoking again. I justified my slip by thinking, "I can't do this alone. Why should I be quit and struggle while he can do whatever he wants?" I reiterated to myself, "I can't quit alone." Now, I'm well aware of how addiction works and how justifications can pop out of nowhere. I used to work with youth with addictions. I just don't know how to keep my motivation going when I live with multiple smokers. I know I should have my own quit, that no person, nor their behaviors, should define my quit for me, but here I am. Those of you that have quit surrounded by smokers, how did you do it? How did you maintain your quit? I'm in a shame spiral right now and I don't want to smoke but here I am. Any advice or thoughts are welcome. I really appreciate this community and couldn't have gone my three weeks without it.

Day 1

Hello all!

So today is the day that I am really trying to do this. I quit when I was pregnant with my daughter, but after having her two years ago, I started back up again. I have been a smoker now for 9 years. 9 years. My god, just seeing that number makes me feel sad. I'm hoping that since I have been working out and have made other healthy changes in my life that this will go better than it has in the past. My biggest trigger is going to be after meal times and driving. Anyhow, this is me just putting myself out there. Thanks for the inspiration guys!!!

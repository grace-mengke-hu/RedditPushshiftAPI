Trying to quit, but can't find a way out.

I'm 18 and started smoking when I was about 15. Not in a large quantity but whenever I was at a party I would want a cigarette. I'm not sure if it was because I'm not the most social friendly person, but whenever I went out to smoke a cigarette at a party someone would come join me. Also it intensifies my buzz when I'm drinking and whenever I smoke pot I feel the need for nicotine, mostly menthol. I am looking for ways to stop, I don't want to keep wasting my money and ruining my health. Appreciate any advice.

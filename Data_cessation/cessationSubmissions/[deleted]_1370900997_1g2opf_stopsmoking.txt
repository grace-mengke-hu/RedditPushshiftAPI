Day 1 without cigarettes!

I've been smoking on and off for about 6 years now. I have reduced my nicotine intake many a times but I couldn't ever quit it completely. I joined the gym a couple weeks ago, and this time, I plan to go cold turkey. A friend of mine suggested that I try this sub-reddit to keep me motivated. Hopefully, it works. Thank you all for this amazing space!

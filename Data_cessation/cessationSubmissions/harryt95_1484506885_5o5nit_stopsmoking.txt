University student . How do I stop during exam periods?

Hi, pretty casual smoker tbh. Smoked most heavily when I was younger, got to at very most 5 a day when I was 17/18/19. Now 21 and thought I had pretty much cut it out. 

Was literally on 1 or 2 a week and that was only when I got blind drunk on nights out. I thought I had stopped smoking when sober. I have now caved during my stressful exam period and am currently on average 1 a day. 

Question is - how do I bring myself to quit during exam time? I don't want the stress of thinking about quitting on top of my already stressful exam time. I know I'm not smoking much but I don't want it to turn into more than 1 a day. Is the 'I can try again after exams' a good mindset to have or is that my brain looking for excuses to smoke again? 

Any tips or advice would be much appreciated. Thanks

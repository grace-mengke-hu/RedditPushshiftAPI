I'm quitting, any advice?

Ok, so I smoked a pack a day for 3 years. This isn't long to others, but it's still a struggle for me. On New Years I said I'd quit, or just slow down. Since New Years I've had two half cigarettes, and a full one. I think it's a good start, but I want to quit altogether. I've gotten to where I'll bum one, or just buy a pack for one and throw the rest out.  I'm having a hard time breaking through the first whole day. I get most of the day in, but the urge just kills me. I take deep breaths and remember why I'm quitting. Any advice? I'm fairly sure I can quit, but there's always the doubt in the back of my mind. I need someone who will help me through it. Someone else who is proud I quit. 

Thanks in advance.

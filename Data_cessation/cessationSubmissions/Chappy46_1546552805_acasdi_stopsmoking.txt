Am I really addicted to smoking?

I basically smoke when I drink/hang out with friends. I can easily not smoke for 3,4,5 days but then I get the opportunity to hang out with friends/family and drink, then I’ll need to have the urge to have a pack of smokes. I can easily smoke the whole pack within that 5-7 hour time of hanging out. I want to stop smoking all together but I don’t want to change my social life. Should I check out the chewing gum (nicorette) or are there any other advice? I bought a e-cigarette but it wasn’t the same. Any advice will help, thanks!

Trying to help my wife to quit smoking, NEED HELP!

My wife is 28. She has been smoking since 12 years old.

We just found out she is pregnant, 2-3 weeks range. Before pregnancy she was smoking a pack a day. She tried to quit completely but is really struggling with it. She is now down to 2-3 smokes a day.

Prior to pregnancy, she tried chantax but it had horrible effects on her.

I am having a really hard time supporting her in a constructive manner. While it is an improvement for her to cut down smoking so much, I really feel like she is not making progress unless she goes completely smoke free.

She is trying so hard. I have tried different methods of supporting her, such as sending texts throughout the day saying, 'just make it today' etc... I tried being tough, she does not respond well to it.

We are going to possibly research other medications that are effective and safe to take while pregnant.

Please help! I am looking for any kind of advice that will be beneficial.

She also read the book 'Allen Carr's Easy Way to Quit Smoking'. Seemed like it was helpful but in the end didn't do the trick.

edit: She wanted to quit smoking prior to the pregnancy and wants to quit 100%. This is not me pushing it on her.

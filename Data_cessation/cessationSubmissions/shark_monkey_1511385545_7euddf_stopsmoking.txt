Almost there

I’ve been a smoker since just before I turned 15 (traumatic event I ended up smoking cigarettes instead of doing drugs or drinking the pain away). I’m not 32. I’ve tried quitting several times since about the age of 19-20, many different ways but medication. I was smoking a pack, sometimes more, a day. 
11 days ago, I started Champix. I was super wary because of the side effects but I want to try. 
So far, no nightmares, no sudden mood swings, and everything else is still physically ok. I don’t really feel different. 
From the pack a day, purposely decreased the amount of cigarettes to about 7/day. I’m not counting how many I’ve had because that makes me feel like I need to me a quota. Instead, I count the hours and try to add more time between smokes. I feel more accomplished with that. 
It helps that when I’m at work, I don’t get that nagging feeling that I need to smoke. 
Tomorrow will be my official quit day. I’m waking up tomorrow and not going to smoke.

What do I do at work, instead of smoke, so I can still have breaks?

I have decided that the best birthday gift I can give myself is 30 days smoke free. I'm quitting on the 1st and I'm curious wth I'm going to do at work instead of my treasured smoke breaks. It's the only time I stand up, move around and get away from my desk. Any advice on things I can do instead? (The water cooler is right by my desk, so that won't cut it)

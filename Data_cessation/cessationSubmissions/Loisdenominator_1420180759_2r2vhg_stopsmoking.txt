Surfing the urge

Welcome to all the new quitters! I thought I'd share this technique I ran across in a book I just finished reading. This is what I was doing this when dealing with those first week cravings, and I thought it may be useful to some.

I like the imagery of imagining the craving as a wave that rises and then subsides and by 'surfing the wave' you are managing that craving in a less unpleasant way, let's say.

Here's a link I found on exactly how the technique works:

If anyone is interested, the book I just finished is called The Willpower Instinct.

**Edited to add**: this exercise is also very useful if you are contemplating quitting. You can use it before you light up when you do get that craving for a cig. The book mentioned a study where those who practiced this technique had a greater likelihood of quitting even when they had no intention to quit to begin with.

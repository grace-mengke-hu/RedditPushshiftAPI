How do you take a break? Seriously, how?

Hi ;)

I have been about three weeks smoke free, I don't miss smoking, but I absolutely miss taking a break to smoke some, I miss some sort of state of relaxation when smoking.

I tried to replace it with herbal tea, I mean drinking a cup while trying to relax/meditate/chill out.

I feel like I need to lay on my back on some pillows with a narguile. But, hey! I don't want to smoke again. 

Any ideas suggestions?

Thanks!

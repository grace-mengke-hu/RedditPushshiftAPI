Been a Month and a week since my last real cig, been about a week since my last vape drag, Feel shit and good at the same time!

Well since I quit smoking I started to change my lifestyle altogether, I went on a low carb diet, started eating right and not eating nearly as much junk food, drinking many super sugary soda's etc, but I have to warn anyone else who is going to try something along these lines BE VERY CAREFUL! Combining quitting smoking with a low carb diet can make your blood sugar plummet these last few weeks have been utter hell, very hard to concentrate, even experienced a low blood sugar induced panic attack slightly dizzy at times, but I know soon it will subside, but I'm going through the rough of it now, this is just a heads up to anyone who is experiencing issues such as mine as I see a lot of people who quit smoking try to change more than just that like I did, but just be careful friends, and don't freak out of if you start to feel like I do, blurry vision, dizziness, headaches etc it's all apart of low blood sugar from quitting smoking/shitty foods it takes awhile for your body to adjust, but I know in the long run I'll look back and be happy I went through these rigorous withdrawals for the better, good luck to the rest of you! ^_^

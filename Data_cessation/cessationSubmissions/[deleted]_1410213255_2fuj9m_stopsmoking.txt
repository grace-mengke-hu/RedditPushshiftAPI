Some advice

To you recent quitters, find something to take your mind off of smoking, get busy. 2 days after I quit I got into 3d modeling, and honestly it changed everything. When I'm in class and I get bored I don't think about a cigarette-butt pressed between my fingers, but what should I model next, what materials should I use, how should I model it, ect ect. And just go where the wind takes you. (And just to show you how busy I've been, here's my latest project i just completed http://i.imgur.com/8iSDgLv.png) And i'm still new to all this, but i'm learning.

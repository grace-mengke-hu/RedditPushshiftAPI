30 days smoke free. Just like to give a few tips

Well here goes my 4 yr old son was telling me to stop smoking. I was getting really feed up of having a cig everytime I did something for example I say to myself "before washing up I have a cig" so....
       I went to my local chemist for help. I'm on patches. 
       Download a stop smoking app. Really great showed me how much I saved. How much of mylife a regained and gave me missions each day to help me with cravines 
       Went on the NHS stop smoking site.  Which sent me text and emails. Information of my health ect 

Hope my tips help other's.  
Tried stopping loads of times before but never had this much support. 

Also thank you to all that's posted on reddit you have also been a great help

Smoking for 6ish years, second time quitting, 3 days in

I just recently got really ill and used it as an excuse to quit, since I won't normally smoke while sick.
I'm 3 days in and more than the nicotine, the thought of never smoking again is killing me. I actually want to cry. I love the act of smoking, hanging out with friends outside a bar, the social aspect was always my favorite. I promised myself I would quit after college and I failed pretty hard at that, and I really wanna take the leap for good now, before another excuse to keep smoking comes my way (broke, can't find a job, etc...)
It wasn't this hard the first time I quit, but It's so hard to think about actually kicking the habit!

I am ready for my badge

After 7 days non-smoking, I'm ready to share my success and accountability via the day counter badge next to my user name. 

Can somebody give me tips? Tried Reddit help with no success? 

Edit: Oops! Found it in the community info section for the sub. Solved my own problem, just like I'm solving my smoking problem!

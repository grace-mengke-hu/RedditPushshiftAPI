Not giving up to give it up

Not sure my grammar is proper in the title, but the point is that I failed to stop smoking a couple of times during the last weeks and I will not stop stopping ... Hopefully forever this time!

Just dramatically burned the rest of my last pack of cigs in the backyard. So angry I bought these again.

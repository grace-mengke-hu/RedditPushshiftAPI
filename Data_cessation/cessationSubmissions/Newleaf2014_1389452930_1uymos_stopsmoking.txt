i want a cig today :( 1 month 3 days

I know I'm just having a bad day, but I'm really missing my old friend right now and am not liking myself enough to care about all the progress I have made! It's really the first day it has been this bad since I quit. I know it's just situational and I have to learn a new way to deal with days like these... This too will pass. It still just sucks right now.

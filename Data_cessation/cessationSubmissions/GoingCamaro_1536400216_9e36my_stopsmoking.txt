It was only a dream...

Last night I had a dream that for whatever reason I just decided to buy some crappy, cheap cigarettes and start smoking again. I'm 20 days without a cigarette and just thought, "well I guess I gotta start over again..." I felt so bad... my steak ruined cause... I wanted a smoke... well as I woke up and realized I HADN'T done anything, I felt relief. I'm still going and I still don't want to smoke... I mean, I do, I like smoking, but it's time to smoke no more... I've already started feeling better and I want to keep it that way...

Help I'm stuck

I don't smoke cigs, I vape about 300mg of nicotine a day of 50mg/ml   juice. I've been vaping like this for two years. I need to quit, I FUCKING HATE having liquid handcuffs. I can't vape around my girlfriends parents and I feel so shitty having to "use the restroom" on a road trip every 2 hours to vape. I'm lying and vaping will lead me to heart disease and high blood pressure.

What are some things to get through withdrawls cold turkey

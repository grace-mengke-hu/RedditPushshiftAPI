Something to consider during flu season

So I've been smoke free for a little over 16 weeks now. Feels great! This past week, I have been rather sick with a stomach flu and one of the effects was loss of appetite - I didn't eat more than a banana a day for a week. Today, my hunger came back, and with that came a very strong crave feeling. I know hunger feels similar to craving, and so I think my body was confused when my appetite returned (and consequently translated that feeling to a craving).

SO, if you lose your appetite when you are sick, when your appetite returns remember you are craving FOOD, not cigarettes! Just some food for thought. Stay strong everybody! 114 days with the help of this sub. Much love.

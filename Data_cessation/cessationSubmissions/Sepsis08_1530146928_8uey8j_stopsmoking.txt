I want to quit tonight but I'm scared

I know it sounds stupid but I've been smoking pretty much non stop for 18 years. Recently I've been feeling awful. Shortness of breath and dizziness and I know that it's from smoking but I'm afraid of alienating my husband and friends because the last time I quit I was an absolute nightmare for the first week or so. And part of me wants to isolate myself from them so that I don't hurt them, but the other part of me knows that I can't quit without their support. I'm also afraid that I'm just too weak willed to actually commit to it and once again I'll have made a half assed attempt to quit. On the other hand though I've never been more serious about quitting so maybe I can do it. I don't really know what I'm looking for here with this post. Advice? Encouragement? Idk. I'm sorry for the rambling paragraph I just don't know what to do or even where to start.

How bad was my smoking habit in the past

Okay so I haven't done much tobacco in the past but I did a fair bit of weed, and I know the weed / tar ratio in cigarettes, did a little math and the amount of weed and tobacco I smoked combined comes to around 60 cigarettes over a 2 year period. I know it's hardly anything but how badly did I hurt my health? I'm very health conscious these days and some reassurance that I didn't do some kind of irreversible damage to my body would be nice. I'm probably worrying too much.

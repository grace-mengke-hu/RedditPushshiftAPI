NonSmoker

I never thought I'd see the day that I can actually say I'm a non smoker! Two weeks and two days (for some reason my badge is off) with no cigarettes! The cravings are rare, if even there now and the thoughts of having a cigarette are maybe once a day, again, if even that. To be very truthful, my husband and I are vaping. I have zero nicotine in my juice but this was to help with my cravings in the car. My only concern is getting addicted to vaping even if no nicotine is there...But guys you can do this. My first day was the hardest and it really has been great since then.  Don't give up on yourself, and with everyone telling you to stay busy is very true!!! Distract the mind!

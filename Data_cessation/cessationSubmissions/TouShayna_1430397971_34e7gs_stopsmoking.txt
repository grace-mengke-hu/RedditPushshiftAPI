Still not smoking!

Nothing new to say really... I just want to see my badge and say I'm still smoke-free! I've been loving the "free" time I have now that I'm not feeling tied to a cigarette schedule. I'm truly amazed at how much easier this has been than I thought it would be. I really don't think about smoking. I see people smoke/smell smoke and it doesn't trigger a craving anymore. Quitting was the best decision I've ever made!

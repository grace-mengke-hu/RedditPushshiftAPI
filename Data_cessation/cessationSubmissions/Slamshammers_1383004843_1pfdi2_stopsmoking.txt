Previously quit with ease.

Quit for months, started working with different people at work now and can't help but have 1 or 2 a day. A week later, and now I'm having 3 or 4 or 5 a day. The only down side to smoking that I see now is it makes you stink, and I have the relentless urge to brush my teeth after one. Wish I had never started.

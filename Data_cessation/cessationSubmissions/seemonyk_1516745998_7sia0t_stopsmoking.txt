3 things that helped to quit

1. The hardest thing in quit smoking is to decide to quit smoking, even if you have a lot of reasons to quit. Just think that you'll not die if you quit smoking :). Actually, after a while, you'll realise that it's easier than you thought. So just try quiting, even for a day. Keep trying until you do.
2. Smoke as much as you like before you decide to quit and smoke every cigarette you might have somewhere. Don't keep any cigarette, smoke everything. Don't throw them to be sorry after. Just smoke them. 
3. Replace cigarettes with something healthy like water or fruits.

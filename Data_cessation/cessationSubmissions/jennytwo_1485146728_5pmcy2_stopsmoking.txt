16 days and I'm hurting today

It's not really even the cravings it's my damn nose! I have like a super nose now and it's making me sick! I am smelling a consistent strong perfumey smell everywhere I go! I guess I have only been smelling smoke the last 15 years-now I smell it all. My head is killing me and it's making me have a mental breakdown and then I want to smoke to calm the fuck down! This is really messing me up and I am so close to just saying screw it and smoke...but I won't because I am doing this for my daughter as well as for me. But geez this blows!!

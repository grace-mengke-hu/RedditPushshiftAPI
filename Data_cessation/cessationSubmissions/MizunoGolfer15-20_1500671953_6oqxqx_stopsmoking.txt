How I quit

Saw u/voodoojuice27 post yesterday and thought I would share how I quit.  I am not sure if this is a thing on this sub or not, I am going to take the who/what/where/how/why approach to this.

**Who**: I am a 27M who started smoking when I was 16. I strive to be accountable for all my actions, do not like making excuses or hearing them, goal oriented, have a problem carry though with my promises, and a bit of a loaner. 

**What**: I wanted to quit smoking for a few years.  I started when I was 16, went through a bit of a drug period, went to college, and got a job.  Every time I wanted to quit I had a reason not to, whether it be I am about to start a new job so I do not want to struggle, or I will wait till I am done with school (this lasted a while).  By the start of this year, I was up to 2 packs a day.

**Where**: I live in NJ, so a pack of Marlboro Lights is like 8 buck, plus the candy I bought or whatever would be like 20 bucks a day.

**How**: I used the nicotine gum.  To start, I bought the big box of 4mg CVS brand.  I did not start it right away and did not tell anyone I was planning on quitting.  One day, for no real reason I guess, I decided the cigarette in my hand was the last cig I would have.  I finished it, went home, and got the gum out.  The first week was tough, I ate like a pig, was snappy, and slept more than I normally do.  The gum would give me a rush, and I was popping it in whenever I had the slightest craving.   

On the gum, I never counted my pieces.  From the beginning, my plan was to go through 2 big boxes of 4mg and 1 small box of 2mg.  Figured it would be 12 weeks. For the two big boxes, it lasted me like 8 weeks.  It was a tough transition from the 4mg to the 2mg.  I did it over a weekend which was smart because I slept like a rock for 2 days.  When I got done the 2mg box, I did not want feel like suffering, so I bought another small box of 2mg.  This was like week 11

The gum gives you a little buz.  By the time I was on the 2nd box of 2mg, I did not need it any more.  What was happening was I was bored at work and popping the gum to get a head rush, but on the weekend when I was doing stuff would only have like 1 piece all day.  Over Memorial Day weekend, by Monday I felt like I had a cold.  Tuesday at work I was fine, chewing massive amounts of gum again (like 6 over the course of 9 hours).  The same thing happened the next Monday, and I realized I was going though withdraw.  So slept all day that Monday (called out of work) and tossed the rest of the gum.

Another thing I did was went to the gym.  I blew up to 225 (I am 6') and was not feeling good about myself.  I started hitting the gym right about the time I went to the 2mg gum, and I lost 20lbs in a month and a half. Feel great now.  I think this helped me go over the top.  I was on a strict diet, working out, waking up at 5am to hit the gym.  I was so miserable and discipline in my health that I did not have time to think about smoking. 

**Why** The most important part.  Two reason really, first was being addicted.  I hated it.  I did not like waking up in the morning needing to smoke, or going on a business trip and being concerned about lay overs.  The whole part about "needing" cigs was destroying me

The second was money. I got student debt, live my my dad, lease a car, and like to play golf.  I was just breaking even with my income.  like I said, 2 packs a day at $8 plus something else from 7-11, I was spending between $500-600 a month on nothing.  As someone who hates paying taxes, I started viewing this as a tax on my life, and I could not take it anymore.  This was the biggest reason by far.  I went from going paycheck to paycheck, now I have a growing bank account and shrinking debt.  I had to make a few other sacrifices, but quitting was the best and in the end the easiest.

**My Advice to someone quitting** The first is to know why you are quitting.  Not why someone else wants you to or why you should, but why you are.  For me the fact that smoking is unhealthy had nothing to do with it.  I did it for my reasons, and that is why I succeeded.  I knew what they were, why I hated them, and made a plan to change.  Again, for me it was money, and after the first month of quitting I bought myself a 600 dollar Tumi briefcase.  Having that physical victory in my hands was clutch at the time, and got my into the next month.  Whatever you reason is, know it and celebrate it as you go.

The second, do not tell people you are quitting just do it.   I did this for years.  I would tell people I was quitting and stop for a little, than be right back at it.  There are plenty of studies that say once you say something out loud you get a sort of gratification and do not work as hard at it.  If you want to quit, do not share it with other people for their reaction, just do it. For me, it was two weeks till my brother complimented me on not smoking. That was the first time I talked to anyone about it.  I never brought it up to anyone.  I think this was key.  I quit for my self, for my reasons.  If you do the same, you will quit.

Edit: Grammar, I am sure there is more

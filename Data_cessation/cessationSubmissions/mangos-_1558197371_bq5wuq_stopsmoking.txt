Will one buzz hurt me?

I’m around 36 hrs into quitting smoking for the first time in a couple years. i’ve never been able to actually stick with it but i’m doing it this time. i know taking one buzz is not advisable, but would it really be that bad to just ease the cravings. i feel like it would just help decrease some of the side affects to quitting cold turkey.

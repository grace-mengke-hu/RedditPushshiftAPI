What's wrong with me?

Sorry if I don't express myself well, English is not my native language.

So I've been smoke free for 6 weeks. After I quit, I haven't have a single cigarette, not a single one. I feel proud about it after smoking for 14 years. The later years of that I smoked almost a pack a day.

I don't get cravings anymore on the places/times that I used to smoke, there have been days that I don't even remember that I used to smoke in there.

But what I've noticed about it...

&amp;#x200B;

The bad:

* I can't sleep well, I wake up like 2 or 3 times in the night and when I finally wake up, I'm very tired as if I didn't rest anything. I get to work and barely have energy to get through the day and when i get back home the only thing I want to do is sleep.
* I've gained a lot of weight but I haven't eat more than I used to. My wife can testify against that (lol). I don't know why but on the six weeks that I haven't smoked I've gained around 12 lbs and been eating the same as I used to when I smoked.
* I've noticed that I get drunk a lot faster and get blackouts and forget long parts of the night. When I smoked, I used to hold my alcohol and party pretty for long and not get too drunk, now, with the same amount of alcohol I get super drunk and get blackouts, before I never (like never ever) forgot anything even if I got very drunk.
* I get irritated very fast. I don't get aggressive or anything is just that I don't want to deal with bullshit. It's as if my levels of putting up with something/someone got cut down to half and I just don't want to deal with it.
* I have gastritis every day. I feel my stomach very acidic, as a burning sensation and i didn't used to feel like that before.
* In those 6 weeks I've gotten sick (I got a problem related with my ears and a very hard cold) when I hardly even got sick before. Also I'm having headaches almost every day but I think that is because I'm very tired always.

&amp;#x200B;

The good:

* My smart watch is reporting lower heart rates.
* I get less agitated when going up stairs or when suddenly have to run to catch a train or something.

That's all I can think about right now, and that is my problem: I feel that the bad outweighs the good.

I read the  Allen Carr's Easy Way to Stop Smoking book that many people recommends in this sub and it's as if what he says that I was gonna win by quitting smoking is what I'm losing.

Don't get me wrong, I'm very motivated that I had my last cigarette and I completely stopped but I have to wonder what's wrong with me? I left something that was very bad for me and instead of feeling great about it I'm feeling like shit.

Long time ex-smokers, was it very hard for you too?

TL;DR: 6 weeks without smoking, feeling like shit.

Just wanted to stop in and say hi to everyone and bye to cigarettes.

I quit today. I tried to do the badge and I hope I did it right. Basically I'm a longtime lurker. I am an alcoholic and have been clean since Saturday. Now that I am over the biggest hump so far I am ready to quit smoking and started today. I am patched up and have the gum and I am feeling great. I quit drinking and I am in AA and soon therapy. My life is back on track after 10 years of drinking and 20 plus years of smoking and I feel like a human again. Back to reality and I love it alcohol and smoke free. I have a long road ahead and feel great going forward. I just had to share. Thanks to anyone out there reading this.

Edit: Thanks for the kind words and encouragement everyone!

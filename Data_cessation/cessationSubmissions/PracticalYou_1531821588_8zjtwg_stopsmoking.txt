Start Again

I’ve reset my “quitting day” over everyday for about a year now. It’s been eight years-I’m 30 years old and everything in my body is asking me to stop.
The hardest part is my roommate still smokes cigarettes and spliffs which is an entire extra layer on-top. Part of my believes if it was just me-with no tobacco ever available at my home - I would be a year out by now. I only smoke when I am home and it is available. She hides it and then forgets and then in the morning it’s there-and when I get home - it’s there.
I’m turning to this forum for the first time because I truly believe it can help. I’m not sure if anyone else has quit while living with an active smoker, but I would   love some advice on how you handled it.
I reset the app for today determined to take it one day at a time. One moment at a time. But at 7pm when I am walking through the door-my initial feeling is “God I could use a cig.” And then I smoke and feel guilty, cry, and say, “I’m never going to be able to do this.”
But I must. I must. I must. 
It is no longer how I wish to survive my life.
Any advice?

Thank you for listening. 🥀

Feedback on a relapse please?

Hey all. So here's my story. I smoked for about 12 years. Quit using chanpix for almost 3 years. The champix made me seriously depressed and fat. NOT RECOMMENDED. It also made quitting seem too easy. So i started smoking cause i got the sense it would be easy to quit without the champix. Ha. Since then it has been another 3 years. I'm Doing a one month work stint in malaysia and decided i'd use lack of ild routines and cues to kickstart me into quitting. As soon as i arrived i dropped from a pack a day to one per day. I knew this wouldnt be sustainable in the long run as i'd soon be back to 20 a day. But i used it to flex my eillpower muscles and delay the first cig to the late afternoon and then deny anymore until the following day. As soon as i saw that i was gonna start rationalizing into smoking more. I dropped the pack and quit. That was 8 days ago. First few days were bad but the third was a nightmare. And then the 7th was brutal. Quitting in asia is hard. People smoke a lot here. And are generous with the cigs. I smoked cause i struck conversation with a couple of malays and one inocently offered me one. And i not so inocentely lit it up. Pure 'just one wont hurt' mentality. I'm pretty sure there was no nicotine in my system and its the psychological habit that I'm struggling with now. 
So. On my first quitting attempt i had focused on the wins and not the losses. But i didnt smoke after 8 days of freedom then. How big an issue is this? Did i just fuck it all up?

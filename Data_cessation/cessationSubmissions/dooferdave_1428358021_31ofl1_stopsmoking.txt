What type of smoker are you (or used to be)? Knowing this could help you quit better.

I was going to post this as a response to another post but I think this should be shared with everyone.


My understanding is that there are at least 3 types of smokers. 


1. Chemical addiction (the addiction to the nicotine) 


2. Physical addiction (the addiction to the act of smoking or hand-to-mouth. Usually these types also are nervous twitchers...no offense to twichers) and finally 


3. Psychological addiction (the addiction to act of smoking but not hand-to-mouth, more of the social pressure or stress. We tell ourselves that it will help calm me down or something along those lines.)


Each of us can have one or more of the above addiction traits. Each trait has different withdrawals and thus a different technique to handle it.  It is helpful to understand which traits you have before attempting a quit. This makes you much more ready to tackle the withdrawal symptoms in the appropriate way. 


For me as a 28 year smoker, I kinda understood what my traits were and Vaping met them perfectly. I was off the nic in a month and off the Vape in two. I would have had much worse withdrawals had I tried cold turkey. I am a physical addiction (#2) trait with a little Psychological (#3) mixed in. It was important for me to introduce new habits into my routine to fully break the cycle of smoking.

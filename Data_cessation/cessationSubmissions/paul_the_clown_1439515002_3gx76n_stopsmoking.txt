This post is for us!

[This is how I feel right now!](http://imgur.com/HE3M5FT) We nailed it today guys. Even though there will be many more days to come, I believe in you. And I KNOW you believe in me. 

You all quit and other people around you may have laughed, rolled their eyes, or said something along the lines of "That's what you said last time." You probably put your cigarettes under water in your sink, threw them in the trash, or you ripped them in half dramatically and took a picture to send to someone like I did. 

It will get difficult and we will try to reason with ourselves to have "just one." As long as I don't give in, you can't either. Let's be here for each other because we are both fucking amazing together. The point is, we let it go! **WE FEEL FUCKING GREAT, FUCKING PUMPED, RICKANDMORTY100TIMESRICKANDMORTY!** 



What I did: Every time I had an addictive impulse, I read your posts and it made today so easy. Went cold turkey, stashed jolly ranchers and gum in my car, backpack, room, and office. I still go outside when I get the craving to smoke and just sit there...it's fucking beautiful to actually see your backyard for what it is. 

It was no where near as bad as I thought it would be. I feel human again, [fuck the zero](http://i.imgur.com/HG34ILW.jpg).

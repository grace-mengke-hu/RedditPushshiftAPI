Got a star!

At the end of 1 month, nicotine-free, I feel happy, content and relaxed. I smoked for 10 years, about 1/2 pack a day, and quit cold turkey. 
For those out there who are just starting, this is very a short summary of my experience this first month:
The first week, there was pain and withdrawals. Very uncomfortable, to say the least.
The second week, there was relief at having made it longer than a week and overconfidence!
The third week, depression/insecurity (nicotine is a hell of a drug). 
The fourth week/1 month, happy, content and secure. The whirlwind of symptoms and emotions that you experience in the first month go away as quickly as they come on. Stay positive, and remember that you aren't giving up anything!

The support I received on this subreddit really helped, and I will be here to support others.

How to know when to drop NRT?

Hey guys

So I stopped smoking for about the millionth time 17 days ago, and have been coping really well. The difference this time is that I gave NRT a real go this time. 

Stuck to it, took my lozenges of 4mg for about 7 days solid, then for the next 7 days did 50% of the lozenges at 4mg and 50% at 1.5mg. 

For the last few days I've only done 1.5mg, and I'm beginning to feel completely ok if I miss one, or if I don't have one I don't realise. I still feel a little antsy when I do miss one and then subsequently realise I've missed one which says to me it's the psychological than physical addiction.

I've still got maybe about 30-40 tabs left of 1.5mg, so will use these up, but I'm trying to judge whether after these are gone (maybe another week to 10 days worth if I taper off) whether that's enough time to fully stop everything.

Thoughts?

having a difficult time but I think i can do it

i bought one pack 3 days ago and just finished it earlier today which is normally how long it takes me to go through 2-3 packs, so ivecertainly slowed down, when i finished this pack i decided not to buy another one and switch to my ecig until i can slowly ween myself off but it is very difficult for me to control myself. anyone able to thelp me stay on the straight and narrow?

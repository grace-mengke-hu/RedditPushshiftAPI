I just can't do it.

Hi

I'm 19 years old and smoked almost two packs a day for about 5 years now. I live in a country where cigarettes are really expensive (~$9). Also, I can feel how cigarettes are slowly destroying me. The shitty part is that I just can't stop.

I even watched "the video", which made me realize how stupid smoking actually is. I quit about 10 times the last two weeks, and it never works out. I don't know... feeding the little monster just feels too damn good.

Any advice?

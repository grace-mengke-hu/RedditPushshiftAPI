Thoughts on Vapes?

So as the title says I would like to get a well rounded view of what everyone thinks of using a Vape to stop smoking as I have pretty much tried everything from cold turkey to patches, inhalators and gum, I have yet to try champax and preferably would not want to go down that route, I smoke less than 10 a day normally and was thinking about buy a Smok Vape to use to help stop smoking.

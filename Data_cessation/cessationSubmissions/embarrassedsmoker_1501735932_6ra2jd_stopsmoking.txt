I feel triumphant tonight.

I posted here a few weeks ago, unexpectedly 12 weeks pregnant and afraid I just couldn't quit, as I wasn't even having much luck cutting down.  As I mentioned before, my doctor told me my baby would have the same odds as a non-smoker's if I could quit by 14 weeks.  

This past Sunday I decided I was more scared of not taking that window of opportunity than I was quitting and I just didn't buy more.  It's really been fucking awful if I'm being honest but I haven't touched one since and today I finally felt much better.  

Quitting right now with very little stability and full time care of my toddler and 11 year old disabled son seemed impossible.  I also work on my own food business at night after they go to sleep.  Factor in the pregnancy and I've been exhausted and sick more than ever before and I just really didn't think I could do this.  But I am doing it.  Last time I quit it was for 4 years, I'm hoping for good this time.  Thanks for the tips.  Also found out I'm having a girl.  :)

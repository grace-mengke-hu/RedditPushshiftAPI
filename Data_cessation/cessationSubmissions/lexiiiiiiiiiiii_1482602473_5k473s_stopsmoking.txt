I'm trying

I have tried to quit sooooo many times and failed every time. I would go 4 months but yet somehow go bk. I would say just this one, next thing I know I'm buying a whole pack. Then I feel so guilty as I'm buying them. Now I'm on 15 days no smoking. I'm on the chantix, boy does this really work. It make u not want to smoke, u get nauseated just think bout a cigarette. Any one has any tips for me,please share. It would help also if my partner didn't smoke, I think that's my downfall, he smokes. He say he going to quit but until then........

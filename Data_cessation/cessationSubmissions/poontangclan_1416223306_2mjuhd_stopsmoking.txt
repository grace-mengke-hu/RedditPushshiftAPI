New kid to the sub. 25 years old, 7 year smoker, 1 week quit. Need support and ideas

Hey folks, thanks for having me. As the title says, I've been at this for just over 1/4 of my life. I've wanted to quit since year 1, but the willpower failed me. A recent ass kicking I received at the hands of strep throat gave me a head start on quitting, and I've been pretty good about it.

Here's the "but". I work at a bar one night a week. Huge smoking culture there, smoking patio in the back, I'm a fairly popular fellow, cigarettes are easy to get hold of for me. And most of you probably know that urges are harder to resist after a beer or 4.

What are some of your strategies to help you fight off these cravings? For those of you with longer amounts of time having quit, how long did the nicotine monster roar in your ears? When your cravings become truly awful what do you do to quiet them?

Thanks in advance for your answers, I'm grateful for anything that will help me add years back to my life, and youth back to my singing voice. God I miss my high notes.

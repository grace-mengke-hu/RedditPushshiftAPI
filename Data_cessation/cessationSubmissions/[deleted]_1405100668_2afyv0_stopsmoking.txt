How?

 How do you willingly get through a day of not smoking, let alone an hour? Been a smoker 3 years, serious about quiting since January. I've read the Allen Carr book, I've gotten a vaporizer, am eating fruit like crazy, tried to just flat out quit. Still smoking away. I smoke every 30 to 60 minutes when I'm not working. 

When I am, it's every 3 hours. I've found each situation has it's own issues. At home, I'm bored. I can solve this one though by forcing myself out of the house. At work however, I work part time in a busy production center (center city) and the frustration is overwhelming. I feel at certain points that if I don't have a cigarette I'm going to punch the next yuppie or hipster I see. 

Really wish I never started. It's like I can feel the urge to stop so intensely that it *almost* keeps me from smoking, but still I give in.
I know this isn't news, but I'm seriously losing hope.

It's been 3 days. So far so good. Should I expect any pitfalls?

I hope things go smoothly like it's been going for past few days.
What should I be aware of to avoid any drawback? 
I don't think it's a big deal if I break my promise (as I have done so) but this time I really want to kill this habit. 
Peace.

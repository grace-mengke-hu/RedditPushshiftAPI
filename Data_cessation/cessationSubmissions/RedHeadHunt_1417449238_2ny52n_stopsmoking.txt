50 days!!!!

I just hit 50 days smoke free last night at 10 pm. After 10 years and smoking 15 to 30 a day. It feels amazing. I have never stopped for this long. My sleep is amazing. My sex is better. I don't get exhausted and frustrates on long shifts as a chef. I can taste a smell things better. My head is clearer. The last two weeks have been 70-80 hour weeks and I didn't smoke a drag. I didn't even want to smoke a drag. This feels amazing. This community has helped me realize I can do this. Thanks guys.

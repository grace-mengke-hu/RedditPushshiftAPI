Wrestled myself through a month!

Feels good to be able to say, I'm smoke free for a month now! After smoking 30 cigs a day for about 5 years. What I do wonder is, did your alcohol/pot usage go up? I kept pot on a minimum as the action of smoking is too relating and satisfyig - but i do drink a lot more.

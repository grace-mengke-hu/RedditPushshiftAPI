Watched Allen Carr last night, it's obscene how dramatically my perspective has been altered.

I have spent the last two weeks buying packs, smoking a couple then throwing the rest away and 'quitting'. On almost a daily basis. I felt trapped. My conviction has been stronger than ever before yet I couldn't overcome the compulsion to smoke; literally powerless to stop myself from buying more; a naughty zombie on the town.

Planning to quit at midnight I had all sorts of rituals and reminders to help me succeed in this quit attempt (signs on the wall, writing on my arm, a game i devised and of course, the special last cigarette!). Yet, after watching the first half of the Allen Carr webinar I no longer needed them. They became irrelevant just like smoking.

I have completely lost my appetite for smoking, I almost don't feel like I should bother with any flair as I am just a non-smoker now. It feels so concrete. Every time I'd try to quit before I felt like Jesus being tempted by a sexy hooker. Now, that carnal urge has slithered twixt my lips and floated to the moon.

I seriously recommend trying this if you haven't. Find the 'webinar' if you can; then you just have to sit back and watch for 4 hours, (and you're fine to smoke while you do it)

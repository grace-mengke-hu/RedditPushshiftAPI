Smoked.

Last night, I smoked one. Slowly. Then I smoked another one. This morning I found the pack, and smoked another one. I'm at work getting ready to go smoke another one. 

I found my old vape but all the juice was nasty after sitting for 9 months. So, on my lunch break im going to the shop that sold it to me to get new wicks and juice, and I'm leaving my cigarettes with a coworker. 

I browse on mobile 99.9% of the time, so if a mod sees this, please reset my flair. 

I'll be back.

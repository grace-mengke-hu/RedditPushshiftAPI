Hey, what is going on???

So here I am, over a month smoke free, not even a single puff, having easier and easier days as I go by. But this week seems to have risen out of the deeper depths of hell.

I am constantly thinking of smoking, how one cigarette would make everything go quiet and easy, thinking of how good it would feel if I caved just once. My a***ole brain is trying to trick me, and I'm thinking of falling for it this time

I come up with all sorts of rationalizations, if I made it this far this time, I can do it whenever I want. I just need one to get me through this tough, awfully hard week. It's my birthday in 2 days, why can't I just smoke till then?


I thought I was safe from this monster, but this came to kick my pride where it hurts. 


Hopefully, I won't smoke today...

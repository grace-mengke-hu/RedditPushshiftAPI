Need Help with this...

I'm a college student who picked up smoking last summer and recently quit. I'm a very good student who never had any trouble focusing on homework or studying. However, since I've quit I have tremendous difficulty staying on task, and it takes me forever to complete anything. I spend most of the time thinking about having a cigarette instead of actually completing the assignment. Has anyone else had a similar experience?

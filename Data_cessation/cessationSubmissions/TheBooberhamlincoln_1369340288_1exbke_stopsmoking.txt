I am going to quit.

I am a mom. I am nealy 30 and I have been smoking since I was 19. I have lived around smokers all of my life. My parents, friends and currently my fiance.  I know it isn't going to be easy. I need some tips. Specifically, how to fight the urge to smoke when others around you continue to smoke?

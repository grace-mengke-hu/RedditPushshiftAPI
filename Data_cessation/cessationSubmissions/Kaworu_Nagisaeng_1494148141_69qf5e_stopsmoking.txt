Cigs and joints

I'm 28, 10 years of cigarettes and 11 years of joints. It's about a year and a half I first quit smoking cigs because I had a pneumothorax (pretty painful), but smoking joints mixed with tobacco (that's how we do it in europe) got me addict to nicotine again, so I started smoking cigs again a couple months ago. 
Really fed up with it I tried to quit joints and cigs since january but didn't managed to stop. I know lots of people are in my situation, I like being high but I don't want to poison myself with smoke related toxic elements, so here's the thing. I bought a vape for weed (a vapcap) and read Allen Carr's book in three days and quit cold turkey. It's only been a few days but I'm really confident this time. I was really addicted to joints, and thought it was because of the effect, but it was just really my need of nicotine which destroyed me. Now with the vape I barely smoke 1/4 compared to the amount of weed I smoked daily with joints. 
the most important things for me are: there is no combustion at all so I'm not poisoning myself anymore, I really really reduced my weed consumption (1 gram last me 7 days ! And the high is way clearer, enjoyable) and I'm nicotine free! That's the greatest part.
If some of you have questions I'll be glad to help you ents.

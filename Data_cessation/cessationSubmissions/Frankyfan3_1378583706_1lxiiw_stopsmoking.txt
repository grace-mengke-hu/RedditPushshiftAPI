Mourning my alone time

I've been smoking for about 10 years, but had quit for a year awhile back & started back up around college midterms & have been one of those ashtray carrying apologetic self-loathing smokers ever since. My SOs (I'm poly) don't smoke, & while they don't hassle me often to quit it is something they put up with about me. 

Last weekend I battled some severe Strep throat & couldn't smoke because of it. I feel like the hardest part of withdrawals were masked by just feeling awful & sick from the illness. Now that I've been on the mend from antibiotics I had the last couple smokes in my pack & decided not to buy another. That was Tuesday & today is Saturday. 

I'm waffling between anxiety over being out (I always bought my next pack before running out before) & liberation from a habit I've been self-loathing over for quite some time. I haven't had a smoke in 3 days but I'm scared to tell anyone in case I relapse. I don't want them to know if I fail this test of my willpower & I'm starting to mourn the loss of alone-time. Since I'm not a heavy smoker, & I tend to do it away from others nobody has noticed that I've gone without. 

One of the only positive aspects to my smoking was it afforded me an excuse to be by myself. While I'm battling the nicotine & ritual cravings Ok, I'm starting to worry that I won't have this time to myself that smoking has given me in the past.

Any advice for people who have struggled with similar roadblocks would be appreciated. Thanks!

Looking for advice on what to do instead.

I just quit about 26 hours ago with the help of NRTs, so I'm not really struggling with nicotine withdrawal. But the thing that's really bothering me is missing going out on the balcony for a bit, every hour or so. I could just go stand there, but it feels stupid. I also have a vape stick which I use occasionally, but I'm only using that as a sort of "emergency cigarette" rather than a direct replacement. So what could I do out there instead? I want to be able to "take a break from life" like I used to. Any suggestions appreciated.

On day 10... Any advice for having a few drinks and killing a craving?

So I am further than I have gotten in the past. I feel better about this time than previous as well. This shit has not been easy or fun but I know its for something good. My main motivation was my SO so that is really helping out. However, the last time I had a beer I wanted to smoke so bad and the craving just didn't go away. It was the closest I got to cracking. It was on day 5. Thinking about it... probably wasn't a good idea for a beer so early on but what can you do? Anyways, anyone have any tips or ideas for getting rid of the craving when you have a few?

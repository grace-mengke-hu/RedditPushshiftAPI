How/why did you start smoking?

Hi all. I recently have been getting a little too friendly with nicotine. It isnt at a point where I should be terribly concerned, but my smoking has been slowly increasing for a long time now and I need a bit of encouragement to quit while I'm ahead and not let it become a habit.

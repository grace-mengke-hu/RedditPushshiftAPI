When you were a smoker did you avoid cardio exercise?

Have you started a cardio routine now, or started to do any form of exercise you flat out avoided before? How's it going for you now? How was it getting started? What changes did you or have you since noticed in your abilities? What advice an you offer for others who are interested in trying a new exercise routine as a non-smoker?

Edit: It appears that someone came in here and downvoted all of your wonderful comments on your experiences! I'm not even talking about my post, I'm talking about the replies (I always give an upvote to comments on my threads so everyone should have at least 2 karmas haha). Who does that?! You all are awesome and are an inspiration, and I look forward to reading more experiences-Thanks for commenting.

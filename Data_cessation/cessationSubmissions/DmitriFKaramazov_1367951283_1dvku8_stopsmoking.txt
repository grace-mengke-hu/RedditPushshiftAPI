Day 8, and I'm at a loss.

I've reached my 8th day of not smoking and I've kind of hit a wall.

I'm currently doing my graduate degree in music performance, and smoking has become such an ingrained part of my practice regiment that I don't know what to do. I usually practice for about 8 hours a day, and would break up the practice time by smoking about every hour and half to two hours. Currently my concentration is shot, I can't spend more than 20 minutes in the practice room before I reach a level of frustration so high that I've begun throw things around the room. I'm accomplishing almost nothing, I've been stuck on the same page of music for about four days. It's a constant mental battle, and I don't know what to do. I need my complete mental focus in order to successfully practice and get down what I need to get done and right now; I am in a fog and can’t get anything at all accomplished. 

 I know that people will say, “Well, take a few days off and try to adjust.” but that I currently is not possible for me. I’m studying with a number of notable composers and performers later this summer and I have to be completely comfortable with playing the music of theirs that I will be performing before I go and meet them, so time is something I unfortunately don’t have. I have not been able to take a break from daily practice for about 9 months, and I won’t be able to for probably another 9 months. I don’t usually practice much on Sundays, and when I was still smoking I almost never smoked on Sundays.  

I don’t know if there is anything I can do right now. I feel like my decision has come down to either have productive practice time or quit smoking. I never realized it but it seems to successfully quit I have to redesign how I practice in order to take smoking out of the equation, which is the way I have been practicing for about 5 years now.

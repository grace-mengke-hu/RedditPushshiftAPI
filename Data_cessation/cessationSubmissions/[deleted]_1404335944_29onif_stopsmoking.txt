Day 1...again

So I made it 3 days and then last night for some reason, which I still do not know, I went to the store with the thought of getting some flavoured water and walked out with water and a pack of smokes, which I smoked about half of and then doused the other half in water this morning when I woke up.  I so WANT to quit.

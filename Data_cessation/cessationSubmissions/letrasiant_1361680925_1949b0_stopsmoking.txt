Another question about badges and e-cigs

I wasn't able to find any definitive answers when searching through this sub... I am quitting smoking, using e-cigs to help me quit. I am not planning on "switching over" to e-cigs as a complete replacement. I have used lozenges and patches in the past, and they have not worked.

At which point would I be eligible for a badge? Do I start counting after my last real cigarette? Again, I'm not planning on continuing to be addicted to nicotine, but am using the e-cigs as a nicotine replacement to quit much like the patch.

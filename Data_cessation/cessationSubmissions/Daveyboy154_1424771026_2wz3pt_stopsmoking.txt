Just another "I Quit" post!

10 days in, feel great, heading back to the gym.

Using a combination of champix, reading the sub reddit and lots of self talk "think of the money/fitness/teeth" and threatening myself "you've told everyone you quit, what will your dad/gf/boss think."

Anyway, if you are struggling, stick with it. When you get a craving go and do something that you don't normally associate with smoking (like take a shower, or go for a run or whatever.) 

Feels epic :3

 I was 29 and had been smoking since I was 15.  The last 5 years, I was a 3 pack a day smoker.  I loved smoking.  Marlboro Mediums, Lights, Reds.  Winstons. Camels.  All of them.  Then, June 15 2007, 1:30PM.  I had two smokes left in my pack.  I went outside the office to have one.  One of friends who rarely smoked as me for one, she was having a bad day.  This was my backup, spare, emergency pack.  I was never this low on cigarettes.  I said:  "What if this the last pack I ever buy....?"  and gave her one, and we both laughed.  We smoked and she kept giggling.  We were walking back in and she still laughed.  Then she repeated it to another co-worker like it was the funniest thing she'd ever heard....And so I quit.  Right then.  I was done.  Never again. Cold turkey.  Out of Spite. Spite kept me from giving him.  Spite was stronger than my cravings.   I never cared for Menthol, and Austin Full Flavor Menthols sounded like the worst thing ever.  I bought a pack left it unopened and carried them for 4 months.  Just in case.  I knew I wouldn't do it, but it made me feel better knowing I could if I wanted to.  I carried my custom zippo for another year.   Sometimes I still want one.  Sometimes I dream about them.  But I'm always glad I quit.  Im here to tell you, that you can too.  It's not easy.  Sometimes it's awful.  But you are stronger.  The human mind found a way to build a ship to go to other planets.  You can do it. You can quit.  I believe in you.  I have faith in you.

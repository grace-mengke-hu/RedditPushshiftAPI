2 days for being 2 weeks no cigarettes - But i'm so damn cranky!

I know withdrawal symptoms usually last for around 2 weeks. Been meditating, running, lifting, eating well to replace the horrible habit. But i'm still so damn pissy. The smallest things can set me right off! For e.g. my speakers started started making that phone reception noise, and I got so ticked of I screamed 'SHUT THE FUCK UP'. I mean seriously, how long am I gonna be like this?!! haha

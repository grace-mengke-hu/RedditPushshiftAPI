Post-smoking detox suggestions?

Tomorrow will be my 70th day of freedom from smoking and I feel great (commuting by bike helps!) but I still feel a bit gunky and have been searching (and failing!) to find any reliable form of detox to aid the process.

Can anyone suggest anything? My partner suggested beetroot. Lots of beetroot. Like, an obscene amount of beetroot. Any other ideas?

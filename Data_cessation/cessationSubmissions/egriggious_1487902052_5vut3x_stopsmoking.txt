HELP!

I'll start by saying that I've been drinking. 

I started smoking the day my best friend turned 18. I convinced him that on the day he turned 18 he should go down to the local gas station to pick up a lottery ticket and a pack of cigarettes. That was my very first cigarette - a Newport. 

Fast forward a few years and I'm smoking a couple cigarettes every day. I'm doing my best to hide the smell from my college roommate, but he and I both know what I'm up to. It's easy for me to quit if I have a random epiphany about my health, but after months or so, I always pick the habit back up. 

I'm only 20 now. I'm a junior in college. I haven't smoked for 4 1/2 months but I've had a few drinks and I can barely stop myself from walking less than a block down the street and picking up a pack of American Spirits. Or Parliaments. Or Marlboros. I don't care. 

Part of my brain keeps screaming "CIGARETTES ARE HORRIBLE FOR YOU!" but another part keeps screaming "YOU'RE YOUNG! THIS IS THE TIME TO LIVE A LITTLE!" 

This sucks.

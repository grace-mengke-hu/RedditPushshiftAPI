28 M. day 1 again...

So I decided to quit 3 weeks ago.  Got some patches, a little nicotine gum and started the slow march to quitting.  Got about two weeks in and then had some things go wrong in my life.  Frustrated and finding the gum+patches not working for my stress levels I went and got a pack.  Dumb and a waste of what little I had already achieved.  Well today I start again.

All the well wishing is appreciated.  
Oh and any tips on fighting the craving when we are at our lowest are also much appreciated.

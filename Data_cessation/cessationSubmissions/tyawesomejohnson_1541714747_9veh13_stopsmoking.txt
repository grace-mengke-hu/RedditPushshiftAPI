Reset Withdrawal?

Well I used chewing tabacco and cigarettes for about a year straight and then quit cold turkey in June. 
I had horrible horrible withdrawals including brain fog, depersonalization, horrible panic attacks and extreme anger that took about six weeks to subside. 

I never want to go through that ever again and I know I’m never going back to everyday use. 
My question is though, I’ve been clean for four months and my dad wants to share a cigar with me this weekend, now let’s say I just have one cigar and don’t full on relapse, could this cause any withdrawals to come back? 

Anyone here who has experience with this, can you please share your experiences and enlighten me because my fear is that after the cigar is finished I’ll have to go through withdrawals again and I just can’t take that again.

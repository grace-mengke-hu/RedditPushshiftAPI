Checking in on the last day of week 4 on the patch.

*As always, your results may vary.

I love the patch.  I fucking LOVE the patch!  The freedom!  I tried it all.  Lozenges?  Gum?  Fuck that noise.  The problem with those are that they maintain the having to dose yourself.  It's just like smoking!  Dose...ok I feel better.  Oops, need another dose!  Ok, I feel better... It reinforces the 'self-medicating' prison.  It's just like smoking.  I need a smoke, I smoke.  Oops!  I need a smoke again!

On the patch, everything becomes level.  I apply two a day, one in the morning, one in the evening.  Not at the same time, of course.  But hey!  Even going through a 14 day box in seven days is cheaper than smoking.  I've had no cravings for nicotine in 4 weeks.  A month I've felt completely normal!  It's like a sweet breath of fresh air after escaping a prison.

Unlike many...oh so many... attempts before, I'm -enjoying- this.  I'm confident.  I know I have this.  I'm looking forward to the step-down!

Anyway... I know I'm just jerkin' off with this post. but I'm happy and I wanted to share.  It *did* take me quite a lot of attempts before I got the ball rolling... It's a fight with your own mind; you have to keep trying, no matter how many times it collapses around you.  As long as you fight, you're doing better than giving in.  I've been an ex-smoker twice before.  For a year the first time, for 7 years the second time, and I'm hoping the math carries through and I'll be a non-smoker for 49 years this time!

BTW... Even if you quit with NRTs, I highly recommend reading Alan Carr.  No matter what you do, you're better off with your eyes open.

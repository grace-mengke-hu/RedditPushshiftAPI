Quitting helped me financially

I just happened to stumble on to this sub so I thought I would put some of my thoughts when I quit. I'm 25 I quit a little over a year ago. I consider myself lucky as I was able to stop cold turkey and never look back. I would say do the math and look at how much money that you save yourself without spending the money on smokes. That helped me greatly in never looking back. The extra 100 bucks in my pocket a week are much more useful than packs of smokes

400 + hours

Counting hours is fun, it lets me exercise my brain a little bit.  I'm at 400 hours, and now at about 48 hrs post Chantix.  I was pretty nervous about going without it, but I'm pretty serious about being quit this time.  I would hate to lose my 17 day run as it's the longest I've gone in my 28 years of smoking.

It's been rougher than with the Chantix, but being serious is helping.

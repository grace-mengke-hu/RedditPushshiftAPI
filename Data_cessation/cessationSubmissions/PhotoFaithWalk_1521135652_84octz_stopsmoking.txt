Witnessing the Consequences of Smoking

An older gentleman I know was taken to hospice last week after being found unresponsive at home. He died just a few days later. He suffered with emphysema and lung cancer after smoking for a very long time. Unfortunately his body didn't respond well to chemo. My heart goes out to his family. 

The reality of what smoking can do is terrifying. It's a powerful reminder of why I need to stay smoke free. It's only been 13 days, but my breathing is starting to feel less labored and I'm not clearing my throat all the time. According to an app I use, I've saved nearly $70. Still after seeing what happened to this gentleman, it seems I've saved a lot more than that. 

I'm planning to stick with this as it just feels right. The cravings are still present, but they are not as frequent, and typically only last around 3 minutes. I look forward to connecting and reading more of your stories.

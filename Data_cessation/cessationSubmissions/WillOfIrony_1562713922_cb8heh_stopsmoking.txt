On the verge of breaking down

As I am typing this message now I am a emotional mess, I am keeping my tears back. My parents were in a huge argument and it is pretty common for them to argue but every once in a while there is this huge argument where everything seems to get really out of hand. They start insulting eachother and threatening with violence and divorce and I am stuck in the middle. 

Me being the oldest one of my siblings I try to de-escalate the situation always, however my mom said these times such hurtful things about my dad and it kept going on and on and she was eventually crying tears because she was claiming to be unhappy in her marriage and stuff and that she wanted to leave to country.

I haven’t thought often about smoking but in these moments and as of now I still feel the urge to smoke/go buy a pack. Luckily, all nightshops are closed now or else it was very likely that I would have bought cigarettes. I didn’t tho and I hope i can resist the urge in the morning.
l’m sorry for the long post just wanted to vent my feelings and the find a way to deal with the urges in these fucked up situations. Any tips would be helpful.

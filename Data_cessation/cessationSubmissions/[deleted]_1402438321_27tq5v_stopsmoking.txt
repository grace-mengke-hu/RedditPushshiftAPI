Shortness of breath and wheezing

I started smoking for realzies when I was around 19, and almost 5 years later I decided to quit. certain days I would not smoke at all while other days if I'm sitting outside drinking I could easily smoke a pack. So a couple of days ago I decided to quit. suddenly IÂ¨'m experience shortness of breath and wheezing when i'm lying down. It feels like I'm not able to draw full breath and the wheezing sound is freaking me out as I've never heard that sound coming from my body. I've read that it's probably the lungs repairing itself and all that, but thought I would check with you guys. Did you experience the same when you stopped and how long did it last?

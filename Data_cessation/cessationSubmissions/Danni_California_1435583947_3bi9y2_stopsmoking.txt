Had my last cigarette yesterday...

Going cold turkey. I've been awake for all of twenty minutes and I want to smoke so bad. I'm afraid to have my morning coffee, because I may cave. When my husband gets home from work in thirty minutes, he'll be smoking in the house. This is going to be damn near impossible.

Dealing with your friends who still smoke

I quit cigarettes for good last August, and I haven't looked back.  It was probably my 1230981598th time quitting, but it was the one that finally stuck.  I think the most important thing to remember is that there is no "just one."  A nonsmoker doesn't take a puff of a cigarette when he's drunk.  A nonsmoker doesn't bum one because he's having a bad day.  If you are a nonsmoker, then you will not smoke.  It's really that easy/hard.

If you're looking for a little inspiration, I've never heard from anyone who regretted quitting cigarettes.  Last winter, I didn't get chronic bronchitis.  I no longer have weird bumps in my mouth, and my receding gums have started to heal.  I don't feel hungover after a night of drinking.  I've started running, and my skin looks younger and healthier.  

The one problem I have is with my old smoker friends.  I have gotten to the point where I abhor the smell of cigarettes, and I hate breathing in secondhand smoke.  Some of my friends smoke a lot, and I can't stand the way I smell and feel after a night out with them.  Yesterday I went home early because my friend was chain smoking and the smell was actually making me nauseous.  After a while of shifting around to try to get downwind, I just gave up and let it envelop me.  This morning when I went running, my throat was sore from it.

Is there any nice and non-preachy way to say "Please don't do this around me?"  How do you guys handle your smoker friends?

Cannot Sleep!

My wife and I are both three weeks into our quit after 15+years of smoking. She went cold turkey and had a short phase of sleep trouble. 

I quit using patches and got halfway through the second stage(14mg) before I stopped using them (today is the fifth day without them).

The issue I'm having is that I can't sleep more than 3 hours at a time in any given stretch since I abandoned the patches.

On Saturday I literally walked up a mountain, cut the better part of a cord of firewood, drank 8 beers, took a couple of tylenol PM and passed out. I was asleep for three hours before I woke up and could not go back to sleep until after 6am when I slept until 9 and had no choice but to get up.

I'm trying these commonly suggested tips like breathing exercises, exercise, and "powering down before sleep" but I'm almost at the end of my rope here. 

Should I pick the patch back up after so many days without it? Any and all recommendations are welcome. 

Thanks.

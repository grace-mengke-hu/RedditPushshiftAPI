Question for everyone who has quit: What's the withdrawal symptoms and how long do they last? Intensities?

Basically I decided to quit smoking Monday night. So I quit and have been using an E-cigarette to curb the nicotine craving. From what I've been told by a ton of people is even though I'm getting the nicotine, there's a bunch of other chemicals my body is withdrawing from.

I have a vaporizer coming tomorrow that I'll be using for a bit as I slowly start reducing the nicotine in the juice.  My question is, how long and what kind of symptoms have you guys experienced? What can I expect?  I basically have been having headaches, and that's mostly it.  Just wondering if someone can describe what I'm gonna be experiencing. When is the worst? When does it get better? Etc.

3 Days! I never thought I could do it!

3 days since my last cigarette! Today was hard but for sure not at as hard as the first day. I know that it is still going to be hard but each day I get behind me makes me a little stronger!
It makes the mantra in my head a little better! I keep telling myself why would I smoke now its been THREE DAYS!

Sorry! I just had to share! You guys are amazing.

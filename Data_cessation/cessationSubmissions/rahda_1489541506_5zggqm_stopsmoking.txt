Realizing this time IS different. Thoughts on long quits that quit

I have quit smoking for four long periods of time now.  Three quits that lasted 5 years two of those times, and the other was for 2 years. And this one is my final one! I know it inside. I am truly happy to see it go this time. The thing is all those times I hadn't done some critical pieces of my self work. I still thought I was missing out on something by not smoking. Oddly, just one time I took it up for stress to get through grad school, but the other times? I started because I felt free and empowered at those stages in my journey!  I thought smoking was something I could enjoy and got hooked by believing I could quit whenever a few times! Wow, that's some good inner realization. I looked back to my first experiences becoming a smoker. From ages 13-17 I felt it was freeing me. I would go to meditative spot in the woods and escape my home life and it felt like one thing I was controlling for myself in an abusive home and also like I was free and maybe gain some rebel points. I think it helps to think back on those early moments to understand what we were really seeking. Also the other times I quit weren't nearly this hard! I never want to do this again and I love feeling more free then ever each day. I feel free and I know I am not missing a damn thing! Sorry for that being a little rambly. Just some thoughts on those moments when even after years one can become a smoker again. Feels so different this time! Happy! Even though I still feel withdrawal.

I have found my biggest trigger/problem. Hard to sit on the porch without smoking

I love sitting on my porch with my phone and some smokes. I end up sitting outside chain smoking though. It's just something to do while I'm on my phone. Any solutions? Sitting outside is one of my favorite, relaxing things to do (plus it's the only place to get Wi-Fi) and I'd sit out here for hours if I could without feeling disgusted with how many cigarettes I've gone through. What could I do instead?

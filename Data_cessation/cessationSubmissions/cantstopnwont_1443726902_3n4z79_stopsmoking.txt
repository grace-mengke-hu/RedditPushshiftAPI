just had my 28th birthday...AND my one year anniversary of being smoke free!

I turned 28 last week which marks one year of being smoke free!!! It sucked pretty bad at first. I was a grouch, I was anxious, I was sick of denying myself, I avoided social situations that I though would tempt me to smoke, I pissed my boyfriend off, I gained a few pounds. Sounds terrible right? No. What was terrible was that feeling of always *needing* something when I was still a smoker. Always feeling unsettled without one. What was terrible was that all of my clothes, my hair, and my breath always smelled like an ashtray. Not being able to walk up a flight of stairs without getting out of breath. Avoiding hikes because I knew I'd get out of breath. Having an obvious smoker's cough attack during one of my work meetings. Accidentally burning cigarette holes in my car. Having acne and a "grey" complexion. Disappointing my parents. Getting hangovers that are even worse than normal hangovers. Wasting $5+/day. Not being able to enjoy myself in situations where I can't smoke. Feeling like I have no willpower or control over myself because I can't quit. Having the thought that I am probably giving myself cancer (among other things) in the back of my head all day, everyday. No, **THESE** things, my friends, are much worse than a month of being grumpy and having to force myself to have the willpower to say no. Every minute that I have craved a cigarette has been worth it. Because today, I don't have to worry about any of these things. I feel free.

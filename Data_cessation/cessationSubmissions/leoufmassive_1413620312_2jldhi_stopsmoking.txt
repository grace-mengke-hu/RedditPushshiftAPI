Staying strong, and I hope you are too

I just wanted to thrw up a quick holla to all of you guys. I don't really delve into this sub as much as I should but I see all your stories and your attemps at quitting - I see you, keep doing your thing guys. It ain't easy but it's a battle worth fighting.

Whenever I read one of your stories it helps to keep me strong, so hold tight all of you for this sweet little support network we've got going on. 48 days strong yo.

I've got a twin brother who's on his 361st day today, so a little brotherly competition from him is keeping me motivated too.

Keep clean everyone! You all make me proud

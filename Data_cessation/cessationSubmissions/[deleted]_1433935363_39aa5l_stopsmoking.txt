This is for me to look back on and hold myself to my convictions.

Started smoking at 13. 27 now and I've been at a pack a day for almost 10 years. My parents quit smoking when they found out they were pregnant with me. My dad was 27 then. I'm not having a child yet but it's absolutely time to quit. 

This is the most positive subreddit I think I've ever seen on Reddit. 

I'm going to use this post in the future to help remind myself of my new lifestyle.

Day 45, and a major milestone.

Hey Guys, 

45 days in, and I can't believe I've made it this far. Last night I overcame the first fight with my spouse without having a smoke, and I was told that would likely be a major trigger. It sure was, but I made it... 

If you're thinking about doing it, do it! I'm loving tasting things, smelling things (mostly) and I do not miss the cough. I'm finding it really rewarding, and for the most part the cravings are gone. 

Thanks for the support guys.

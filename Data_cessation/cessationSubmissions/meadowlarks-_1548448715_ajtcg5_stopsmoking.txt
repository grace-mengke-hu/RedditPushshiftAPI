Second day cigarette-free!

I don’t even feel the urge to buy a pack today. I’d been smoking for two years (with a 4 month break aka first attempt to quit in the middle). This is the final second day for me!

I broke up with my boyfriend who would smoke 2+ packs a day (in his apartment too, yeesh) for other reasons, but that has really made it easier. A lot of people in my social circle (I bartend) are smokers, which makes it tempting, but I can just choose to not go outside with them OR go out and not bum one. I haven’t been out to the bars after work in the past two days but I’m going to be firm, even if I have a few beers. This post is for accountability lol.

I’m feeling good about the path I’m on and I can’t wait for my sense of smell and taste to be back, and for my chest to loosen up a bit. I can’t wait for my clothes to not smell. Excited to take care of my teeth and skin and to save all that money I would be spending!

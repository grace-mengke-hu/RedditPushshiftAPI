A Sincere Thank You to you /r/stopsmoking

Thank all of you for your continuing support, not only to me, but to all of the other "quitters". I can honestly say that I do not have cravings anymore. It's such a great feeling to be free of the want/need of nicotine.

Good luck to all of you! We're in the journey to a healthier lifestyle together!

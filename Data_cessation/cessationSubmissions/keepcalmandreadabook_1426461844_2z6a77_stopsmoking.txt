F**ked up after 3 weeks, feeling remorse, but I want to quit again...

I fucked up guys, I just had too much xanax (prescribed but I abuse sometimes like on weekends) or was too high or too stressed (posted about almost drinking after two years sobriety [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2yvaf2/i_just_dont_give_a_fk_anymore/)), regardless, I caved and had one. I knew it would turn to two. And I didn't even really enjoy those first 5 that night, because I knew the next day the nicotine would really hit.

So the next day I scrounged all my change and bought a pack. I said I would quit after that. I smoked all night, had a wonderful camping night with a friend I haven't seen in years and might not again for years, and said, "If I shared a cigarette with her, that would be enough. That would be special." Lies. I finished the pack that night and today I just traded some of my xanax for some squares (cigarettes).

I can't be doing this shit. Cigarettes are like crack for me. They are the cherry on the topping of the sundae of the sundae that I don't need when I don't smoke. Everything suddenly becomes worth driving across town to smoke a bowl if there's a cigarette after, shit.

I'm pissed at myself. I have two cigarettes left. I'm going to write in my novel and clean. I am going to try to get as high as hell and say fuck you cigarettes and smoke that last one and become a non-smoker again. I went three weeks, goddamnit, *three weeks*.

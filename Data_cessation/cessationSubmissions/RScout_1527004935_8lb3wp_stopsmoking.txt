Today is the day im going to try.

Ive been smoking on and off for years. Recently ive been switching to vaping. Ive used the minimal dosage of nicotine and overall it worked rlly well. Today in going to try to switch to vape with no nicotine. I hope i can end it for good now. 

Thanks to this subreddit for giving me the motivation. Let me know ur succes stories if you have them!

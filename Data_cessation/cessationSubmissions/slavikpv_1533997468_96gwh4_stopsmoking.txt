Fuuuuuuuuck

2 days after quitting nicotine (11 days after cigarettes) and my withdrawal is a pain in the ass. Simultaneously i want to lie in bed and stare at the ceiling, and to strangle the next pedestrian i see on my way to the grocery store. Fuck cigarettes, fuck nicotine. I dont want to ever go through it again. Fuck fuck fuck fuck shit cunt bitch

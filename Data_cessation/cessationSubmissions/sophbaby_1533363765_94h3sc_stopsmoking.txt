16 days in, STRUGGLE TOWN

Hey! So 16 days strong after quitting cold turkey. I’ve had slight moments where the thought of smoking has popped into my head but it’s passed fairly quickly. I thought I was in the clear. 

I was incorrect. 

I quit with my dad, who has heart disease and the beginning stages of emphysema. I figured it was hypocritical of me to harass him to quit when I was still smoking so we did it together and it’s helped me stay on track because I’m not only quitting for me, but for him too. 

Today’s been fucking ROUGH. All I’ve thought about is smoking. I feel depressed, irritable, angry, helpless. And also really confused. Why is it suddenly so hard? I’m not going to give in, I’m confident I’m strong enough to resist but it’s still disheartening that the cravings can come on so strong and out of nowhere. I chew gum like a lunatic, until a few days ago I WAS eating everything in sight but I realised I’d replaced one bad habit with another so I’ve cleaned up my diet. Any other tips to get through the really bad cravings? 

PS, this forum is an absolute lifesaver, scrolling through other people’s posts and having somewhere I can vent when everyone else basically tells me to get over it is amazing.

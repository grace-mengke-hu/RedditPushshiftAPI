Hello!

I just found this sub. I’ve been smoking anywhere from half a pack to a pack a day oncer the last two years. I finally hit the mental wall of “This is the biggest waste of money, time and health ever”. I have only 2 cigs left in my pack. I’m gonna smoke them tomorrow with the thought of never touching a pack ever again and I know I can stick to it! Any tips on quitting and how to fight the lethargic/bad mood/ cravings for the first month or so? Any advice is appreciated! I also love how supportive all of you are by helping others out! So glad to be a part of this community!! ❤️❤️❤️

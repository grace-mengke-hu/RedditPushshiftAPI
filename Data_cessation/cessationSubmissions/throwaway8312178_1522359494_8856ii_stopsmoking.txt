I’ve quit for 3 months but had a bad month. Feeling really sick. Help!

Smoked 6 cigarettes this month. I don’t even want them anymore.. they make me so sick! I just had such a hard month and broke down. I’m not worried about started again, but I was wondering if there was anyone who felt really sick after smoking a cigarette again after you have quit. I don’t know how to explain it but I have this really weird sensation in my mouth. I feel it in my teeth, tongue and down my throat in seems. Also kind of hard to breath. I am breathing just fine but not as well as I was before a I caved in.. could this be anxiety or something else?

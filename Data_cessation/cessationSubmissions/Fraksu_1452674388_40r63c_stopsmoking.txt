Need advice on going to a rave alone that is rebel genre based and most of the scene people are smokers

On this saturday I'm going to see Angerfist and I'm from Finland. I really want to go there but I'm going alone because I live in a small town and I haven't got in touch with the right people from other cities. 

Here’s the problem: I think that smoking would help me socialize, or help with my anxiety or the feeling of being alone. I haven't smoked for over 1 month at all, but I think that this situation will strive me to it and I know that it's just in my head. This is why I'm asking advice. 

The party starts from 9 pm and ends at 4 which I'm going to enjoy from start to finish and I'm going there by bus. I would really appreciate any thoughts on this and just to clarify that this means a lot to me. I’m producing this kind of music as well and I’m trying to get in touch with the scene and its people.

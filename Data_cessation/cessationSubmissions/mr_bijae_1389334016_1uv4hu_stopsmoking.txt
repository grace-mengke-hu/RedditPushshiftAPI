Just so you know...

Getting past a specific number of days doesn't mean you'll never have an urge again. I'm sitting here 263 days into my battle, reading about the history of the author of To Kill A Mocking Bird, fighting the urge to go buy a pack and light up and smoke the whole damn pack while I read until dawn. 

There is no get out of jail free card. There is no time that you will NEVER think about smoking again. One image of a young author smoking in the interview of her new instantly famous book and I'm flooded with "GOD I WANT A CIGARETTE" feelings. 

So all you folks with < 50 days, it does get better... but there are still going to be random flashes of desire. It's up to you to decide if you want that day counter to click +1 or reset to 0. The only real question is, What's the bigger regret? That you didn't, or you did? 

For the record.. I posted this instead of jumping in my truck and driving to the store to buy a pack before starting my favorite book....

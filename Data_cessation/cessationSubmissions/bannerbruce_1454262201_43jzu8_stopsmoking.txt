Strattera (Atomoxetine) instead of Wellbutrin (Bupropion)

Hi, has anyone taken Atomoxetine instead of Bupropion to quit smoking?

*Atomoxetine treatment for nicotine withdrawal: a pilot double-blind, placebo-controlled, fixed-dose study in adult smokers.*

It's interesting that:

> We observed no evidence of efficacy of OROS-MPH to aid smokers to stop smoking.

*Methylphenidate for treating tobacco dependence in non-attention deficit hyperactivity disorder smokers: a pilot randomized placebo-controlled trial.*

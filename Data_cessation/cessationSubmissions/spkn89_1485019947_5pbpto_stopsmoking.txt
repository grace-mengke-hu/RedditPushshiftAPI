Almost a week without smoking, and feel like getting into a fight with everyone

Sooo, I feel like I've got the cravings part down. I don't need a smoke with my morning coffee nor after a meal.

However, I'm having this difficult-to-control irritability, whereby I snap at almost anyone who speaks to me.

What are your tips for overcoming this phase ?

EDIT: Thanks for sharing your experiences; seems like I'll have to get used to this for a while

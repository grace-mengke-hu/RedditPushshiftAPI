The road ahead

This morning I woke up with a feeling of overwhelming guilt. Ive needed to quit for a while but today I WANT to. I know that wanting to is part of the battle but I can't for the life of me figure out how to remove cigarretttes from my routine as I am not able to change my routine.

Im 26, smoked since 16. I used to consider myself handsome now I barely can look in the mirror. I have bags, circles under my eyes that no amount of sleep or healthy eating is helping.

This drug is going to ruin and eventually end my life. Im so depressed that I was ever able to get hooked. Ive given up vices that did way more for me but nicotine just seems fucking impossible guys. Im so desperate I was going to tell a family member that I was addicyed to heroin to see if they would take extreme action such as throwing me in rehab or locking me away until I was no longer an addict. Unfortunately being addicted to nicotine does not hold the same weight (for whatever reason) this will be the death of me so why can't I simply decide to stop?

Sorry for the rant guys I havent been to this sub before but I need and want to quit starting right now, starting yesterday

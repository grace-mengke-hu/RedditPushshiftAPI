Just trying out my new flair! :D

So I woke up this morning and decided to be spontaenous for once in my life and surprise myself by quitting! 

According to my original plan I was supposed to quit tomorrow. But I kind of derived away from the plan and the due date was pushed back sometime this month. But then I was like fuck it. Yesterday I smoked three cigarettes around the same time as now (so it's been 24 hours since my last cigarette), and then I didn't feel like smoking for the rest of the day, which I haven't. So waking up today without the urge to smoke was an amazing feeling. And I have decided that I no longer want to smoke ever again! So yay for my first day! :D

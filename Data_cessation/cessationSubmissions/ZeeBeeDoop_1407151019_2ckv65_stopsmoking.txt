Smoked my last cigarette last night...

I have decided to quit smoking (again) so I had my last cigarette last night and haven't had one all day (it is now 1214).


I have stopped before, for nearly 3 months, so I know I can do it. I just need to stick to it!


I am obscenely grouchy today, but I know it'll be worth it!


I'm hoping that you guys can keep me motivated!

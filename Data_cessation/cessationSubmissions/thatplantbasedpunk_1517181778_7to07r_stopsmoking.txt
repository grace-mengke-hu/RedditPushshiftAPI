Unconcious substitute, coffee

Hey guys,

Two weeks smoke free, notices something peculiar. Ever since I stopped I unconciously substitute my cravings with coffee, and loads of it. 
I get annoyed the same exact way if I don’t have a coffee in few hours, and I can drink one after another. 
I want to keep it under control, jumping from one addiction to another doesn’t seem like a great idea. 
I want to be free. So what do you guys think, should I start drinking tea? I used to drink green tea everyday, but it has caffeine (or something similiar to it) too, so would that be defeating the purpose?

Thanks for any help; good luck to you all. We will all make it.

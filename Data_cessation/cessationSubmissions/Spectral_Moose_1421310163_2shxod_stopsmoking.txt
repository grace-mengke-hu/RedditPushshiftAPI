My friend says smoking makes her more sociable. I need help with arguments.

I recently found out that a very close friend has been smoking for about a year. She's 19 and she smokes about 6 cigarettes a day. I've talked to her and she fully recognizes the health issues that comes with smoking because her dad is a heavy smoker. She says she wants to quit because she wants to be healthy, but at the same time she doesn't because she says it makes her a social person. Her argument is that people approach her to chat while smoking and she claims that that never happened when she was a non-smoker. She isn't a happy person; she's been battling depression for some time and she very much appreciates company. She also says that smoking 'defines' her, it's something about herself that she likes. 

I desperately need help with arguments against these points.

Feeling Ashamed

This is my first update since I tried quitting yesterday. I didn't make very far at all.


I can't seem to shake the feeling that I won't feel relaxed until I smoke again.


I don't really know what I want to say. I know quitting takes more than one try. I guess I just wasn't as determined after that initial moment of wanting to be freed from this destructive habit.


I'm not done trying or anything. I just feel like shit.

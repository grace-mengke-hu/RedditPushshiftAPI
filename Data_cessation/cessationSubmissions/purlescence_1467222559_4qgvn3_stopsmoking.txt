9 days and cravings are diminishing

Just thought I'd share for those of you in the first few days of cold turkey. I'm on day 9 and I'm actually catching myself passively thinking about cigarettes without experiencing any desire for one. My physical withdrawal symptoms seem to be gone, and my cravings are fewer and less intense. This is a big change from, say, days 2-5. Tough it out! It gets better!

Edit: Oh also I can smell everything. Walking past fresh fruit in the grocery store is amaaaaazing.

Encouragement to Quit Smoking.

The enjoyment and euphoria one experiences from inhaling the noxious, carcinogen ridden smoke from cigarettes is minimal in comparison to the discomfort and dysphoria one can simultaneously experience from constantly deceiving their true intentions of practicing health and discipline.

I just crushed half a pack of Newport Shorts to kick start my struggle to finally quit smoking these:  Terrible, disgusting, addictive, havoc wreaking, stamina decreasing, lung capacity draining, mind numbing, cancer causing, and life controlling pollutants once and for all!  I hate big tobacco companies and their inhumane, greedy, poisonous, and life destroying products; I refuse to further make them money at the expense of my mind, body, and soul.  My discipline is in full effect to destroy their devious grasp on my life.

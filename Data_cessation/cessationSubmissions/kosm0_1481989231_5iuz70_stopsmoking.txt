1 year without smoking

Hey guys,

Just wanted to share with someone my achievement. I'm so glad that I've quit smoking, don't have cravings and don't think about smoking a single cigarette in my life anymore.

How I've quit? Simple method. Allen Carr easy way. Thank god that I've read it through. 

How it feels? Feels great mate. Got in shape, going to gym almost everyday, jogging and lifting, and eating healthy.

Also having Chronic Hepatitis B, and smoking could've done me more harm that to another healthy person.

Smoked for 6 years, free for 1 and counting. 

Don't let it kill you, quit today ! 

Sorry for long post, just wanted to share this with someone that truly understands.

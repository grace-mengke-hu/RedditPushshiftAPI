Day 1...#547 I must not fail this time...

So I quit last week for a whole 3 days.  I was proud of myself.  Then someone broke into my apartment and made me anxious as hell.  I smoked about 3 packs in 2 days.  My dad just had surgery to remove friggin Melanoma cells.  They said they got it all out, thankfully.  I stopped smoking last night at around 10pm.  I haven't smoked since.  Not even a drag.  I've had one long continuous craving after another, but I will not go back.  I'm fucking tired of this bullshit where I start strong but give in a day or two later.    
  
NOT  
THIS  
TIME  
  
I'm done.  I abhor these sticks of death.  I'm stronger than them.  All I have to do is beat a few cravings for a week and not give in.    
I won't...  
I can't...  
  
FUCK YOU CIGARETTES!!!! FUCK YOU AND THE HORSE YOUR MASCOT RIDES ON!!!

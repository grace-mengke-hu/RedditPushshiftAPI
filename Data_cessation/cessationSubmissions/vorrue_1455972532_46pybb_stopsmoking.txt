Need help addressing a point not covered in Allen Carr's Easyway

Hi there,
I've been smoking on and off for about two years now and became more of a regular smoker over the past six months.

I'm now reading the final chapters of Allen Carr's Easyway, and am uncertain about my decision to stop. Carr covers almost every aspect of smoking, but it seems one is left unanswered. 

The reason I'm unsure in my decision to stop smoking is this one positive aspect of the cigarette I find hard to remove from my brain. It is the blissful, good kind of lightheadedness that happens after smoking the first cigarette after a, say, 4-6 hour break. It's a kind of "high" that I experience as a relatively intensive pleasant feeling that lasts about five minutes.

I don't know how common or intense this "high" is on average with people, so I'm especially interested to hear how other smokers experience that first cigarette after a hour-long break. 

The subsequent cigarettes give me exponentially diminishing returns and I don't enjoy them as much. There almost no high with them.

Could anyone help me analyze this feeling of "high" and dismantle it until I no longer regard it as an advantage of smoking?

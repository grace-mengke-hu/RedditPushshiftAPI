I need to get rid of the smell of smoke outside.

My biggest problem right now in summer is the smell of smoke. As I may get a job again at an airport I will feel the smell of cigarettes everywhere and wow, the feeling of being at an airport and at the same time smell the delicious cigarette ooze will kill me.

This made it impossible to quit last time I worked at an airport.

How do you handle this?

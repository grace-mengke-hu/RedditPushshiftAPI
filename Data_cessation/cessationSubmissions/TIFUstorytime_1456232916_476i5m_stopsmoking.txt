Has anyone had an easy time quitting?

Hi, I'm new to the community, I decided to quit about 11 days ago when I got so sick that I couldn't smoke for fear of violently vomiting. I think over the next days I went through physical nicotine withdrawals that contributed to my sickness. It's been 11 days and I still am coughing up a small amount of phlegm, but I have almost 0 desire to smoke again. I'm the type of person who has had trouble with minor addictions in the past, and I've tried to quit cigs before and the cravings were extremely difficult and I eventually succumbed to them.

I'm just wondering, has anyone else been able to quit cold turkey with no ill mental effects, only physical? Is this just temporary while I'm still kinda sick? I feel the best I've felt ever since I started smoking half a pack a day two years ago. Is there anything I should be on the lookout for in the coming weeks or months? Any advice is greatly appreciated, thank you for your time!

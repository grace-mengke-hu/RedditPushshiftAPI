Whatever you do, don’t take another puff!

I had quit for 28 days.  I was feeling more confident about myself, long walks were easier and the cravings to smoke were minor and very infrequent.  Then I interviewed for a job (been out of work for 16 months) and when I didn’t hear back from them when I was supposed to, I caved and smoked again.  I’ve stopped again (today is Day 5) and the fight with cravings is worse than when I quit the first time.  I still haven’t heard back from them but instead of stressing out about it, I’m applying for more opportunities.  It’s a hell of a lot more productive than killing myself 5 minutes at a time with a cigarette.

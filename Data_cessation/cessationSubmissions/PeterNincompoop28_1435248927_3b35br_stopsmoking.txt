meeeeeeh...

Hello, all. Three whole days down, working my way through the fourth. The cravings are intense, and my brain is in a constant state of stress and defensiveness. I've tried to stay conscious of this, and, thankfully, I have spit relatively small amounts of venom. Does anyone else feel like as soon as you quit, life just starts to mess with you for fun? Just little things meant to constantly test your resolve or something. Anyway, I've kept myself as busy as possible in an attempt to keep my mind off smoking. Music seems to help tremendously, so I'm going to keep that up as much as possible. FACT: I AM STILL A NON-SMOKER. I think that's about it for now. Just needed to vent. Thanks for taking the time to read! Keep up the good work everyone!

Can't believe what I've been missing for the past 8 years. Thanks for the support you magnificent bastards!

Smoke free since August. On day 68 I completed an 11-mile Tough-Mudder race. On day 92 (today) for the very first time my inner monologue said "holy shit I think we actually did it this time." On day 101 I'll be running my first ever 5K. If I can do it, so can you.

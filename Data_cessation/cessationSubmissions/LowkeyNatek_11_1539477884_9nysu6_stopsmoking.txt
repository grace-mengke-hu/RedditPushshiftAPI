One Week, HELP

Im at 6 days and 15 hours, last night i had such a vivid  smoking dream it felt like i could feel the nicotine going into my brain and the smoke going into my lungs. I wanted it. However i was still so happy to wake up and  know it was a dream, now today my cravings are horrible Im gonna have to do some long hard meditation today to get past these cravings -\_-

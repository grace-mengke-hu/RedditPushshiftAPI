I quit smoking.

I quit smoking August 21 2014.
I quit because after 8 years of smoking 10-30 every day I was getting issues breathing when I slept, and I always woke up with a lot of phlegm in my throat and a wheezing noise in my lungs. It was disturbing and uncomfortable.
I quit cold turkey. For about a week. Then I broke down and bought snus, the small pouches of tobacco you place under your lip, just to get my nicotine fix. I quit that after another week.
Then I found what I needed to shift my focus away from the smokes.
I got a gym membership.
Now, as a 135kg man, this was difficult. But I figured that if I was going to be healthy in one way, I might as well try to improve in other ways as well.
I've been working out 1-2 hours 5 days a week since then.
I've become slimmer around my waist, ass and stomach, and my moobs are smaller.
When I don't work out, I feel the need for smokes returning. Even now, ca 5 months later. This sucks.
I don't regret starting smoking. I love smoking. I still love it, but I also want to breathe and not become tired and heavy of breath after 2 minutes of fucking.
Welp, I figured this would be an extra way of keeping my life nicotine free.
Thanks for listening to my uncoordinated story.

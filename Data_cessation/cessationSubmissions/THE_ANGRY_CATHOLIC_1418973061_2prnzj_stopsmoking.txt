Today I'm Ending my Relationship with Nicotine

I started smoking back in High School. All the "cool kids" were doing it and I picked it up. Smoked for about a year and then on and off until I found e-cigs. 

I picked up my first e-cig about 2 years ago and have been vaping ever since. While they are touted as a healthier alternative to smoking, I realized that if I want to be truly *healthy*, **nothing** should be entering my system, not smoke not vapor and not nicotine. 

I've tried quitting in the past and failed but hopefully this will be the time I quit for good. I'm going away to a uni in January that bans smoking on campus (vaping included) and there's no vape shop in the town so I figure quit now and deal with the pain before I leave. 

By far my biggest weakness in all this is driving. Whenever I drive I like to do something and vaping has been that something for quite some time. If anyone has tips for this it would be greatly appreciated. 

Hopefully with your support guys I can end my dependence on nicotine forever.

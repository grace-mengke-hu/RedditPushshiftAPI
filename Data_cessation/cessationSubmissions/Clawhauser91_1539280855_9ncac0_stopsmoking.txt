Dealing with other people smoking

Both my mum and dad smoke. When I’m at home my cravings increase 10 fold. When I’m out and about, at work or whatever then I rarely have cravings. I have maybe 3 friends that smoke but i barely see them as they are old work friends from a previous job. 

I’ve cut back going drinking because I find it harder to control the cravings when drunk.

So any tips or advice?

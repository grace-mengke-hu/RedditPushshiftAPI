What did, "the quit" feel like?

I am on day 6 of quitting smoking. This the 2,678,431st attempt for me.

To provide some context, I smoked a pack or so a day for 17 to 27. From 28 to
30 I smoked every weekend and 50% of weekdays. I became a "serial quitter."

I am three months removed from my 30th birthday and this quit feels like the one. I am so used to withdrawal that it's only the mental game that demands my vigilance. I came off a 6 day attempt and a 4 day attempt within the last month and each time I was undone by 16 pints, give or take a few. I have resolved to quit drinking for the foreseeable future and I have no other triggers at this point.


With that said, for those of you that have quit for six months or more, was there a discernible feeling or action that signalled success for you?

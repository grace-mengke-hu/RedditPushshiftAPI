12 days, thanks in many ways...

Hey guys! Just had to say thanks so much for being such a great support re the non smoking but also for being an amazing place to come and chat/support/lurk when I’m feeling lonely after my breakup - 2 months in and I still get really lonely/low moments. Even if I’m not having a craving I come on here and the support everyone gives each other is really uplifting and makes me smile and feel less alone. Keep doing what you’re doing people, NONE of us need nicotine, we’re all better than that and we have such bright futures ahead of us as non smokers who aren’t slave to an addictive drug. Thanks again guys x

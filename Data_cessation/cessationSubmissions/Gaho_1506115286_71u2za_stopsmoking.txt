One month in and...

I don't really feel great.

Sorry if this unusual, most people here are really happy when they pass these milestones, and I'm glad for them but it's not really the case for me and I'd like to vent.

I wasn't a smoker for a very long time. About two years. From 15 to twenty a day. 


I'm still not nicotine free (I use patches) but as of today, it's been 33 days since I've touched a cigarette.

Sure some things about being smoke free are pretty cool. I have more money, which is nice especially for a student. I'm not out of breath so easily. But honestly I feel like that's about it.

Here's my main problem. I don't crave cigarettes as I used to *but I still miss them*. When I'm on a walk. When I'm waiting for the bus. When I'm reading. When I'm looking at the window. I remember reading in an anti tobacco brochure "Aren't you glad you don't have to walk to the store to get cigs in the middle of the night ?". I'm not. I miss it. When I walk by people smoking, I'm jealous.

I don't know where I'm going with this rent. Did anyone here had (or have) similar feelings ?

Thanks for reading anyway.

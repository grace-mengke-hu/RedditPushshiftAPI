It's quit day

Agreed a long time ago to stop smoking today at the same time as my sister. (we don't live in the same city) 

Last cigarette was 19 hours ago last night. Been feeling fine all day, but keep getting the urge to make an excuse to go buy a pack and sneak a smoke. Been staying strong and hope to kick this habit for good!

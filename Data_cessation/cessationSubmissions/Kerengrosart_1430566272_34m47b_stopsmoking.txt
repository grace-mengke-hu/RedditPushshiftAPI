Just had a cigarette after nearly 8 days

Was a bit stressed with the kids and decided to go and buy 10 cigs. Came back and smoked one and feel like I have just ate a full ashtray (yuk) this is my second time trying to quite on patches and a felt it a lot easier this time. I actually knew I didn't really NEED that cigarette but I think I kinda wanted to undo my good work because I was so annoyed. Won't do that again and back to day 1 now :(

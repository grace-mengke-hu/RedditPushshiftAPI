Made it through my biggest triggers!

I was so worried about last weekend. I knew it would be my first real challenge in my quit journey because I'd be up against my 3 biggest triggers. I spent the entire weekend drinking (trigger #1) with 2 of my oldest friends (trigger #2) in my hometown (trigger #3). But I made it to the other side without a single puff! And it wasn't as difficult as I thought it would be. Here are the things that helped me: I told my smoker friends ahead of time that I had quit, and so whenever they stepped out for a cigarette they didn't invite me (and hence I didn't have to say "no"); and I prepped myself ahead of time with tools, like cinnamon gum, a list of reasons I am quitting, and a few friends to text for encouragement.

The only hiccup was when my best friend said "I just think you're depriving yourself of something you love to do". I was so annoyed by this. Quitting is already hard enough, and then she has to make me second guess myself. But I know what I am doing is right for me and if I stay the course I will eventually get to the point where I don't feel like I am depriving myself, but am instead gaining something infinitely better. 

Thank you for your support! It has been invaluable.

Over a year now!

This sub was really helpful coming this far.   Keeping score and counting days was priceless help in staying motivated.  384 days today and counting.  I do miss smoking, and I know if I ever start again I'll be hooked again.  That ain't happenin.    Good luck fellow quitters, stay strong!

Today marks 2 months cold turkey.

I unfortunately started smoking when I was around 13 years old. Living in the backwater areas in the south gave me near open access to beer, whiskey, cigarettes, and chewing tobacco. I'm 27 now and for the past 5 years been an off and on smoker. Take a few days off, then back to the pack.

Now that I live in Seattle, packs of cigarettes are close to $10 and for the past year I've been smoking nearly a pack a day. It drained my bank accounts as well as my overall health. I noticed I was getting winded going up and down the stairs to get to my apartment. One day I was trying to carry a box up the three flights to get to my place and felt like I was going to die. That was two months and a day ago. I smoked one last cigarette before bed, and threw the rest in the dumpster.  


The following two weeks were absolute hell. I was aggressive and irritable. Even the smallest things would set me off into a rage. All I could think about was cigarettes. Then it just stopped. I still want to smoke, don't get me wrong, I loved doing it and I still love the smell of a smoky bar.

Good luck to anyone quitting.

Made it five days. Now my wife left me. After dinner I want to go to the store and buy a pack. What do?

I know I shouldn't man, but holy shit.  I'm alone in the house, just watching fucking YouTube. No one to talk to.  Nothing to do.  Fuck it man.  I don't think I can do it.

Edit. Thanks guys.  I might punch a hole in the wall but I won't smoke.  I'll try anything else first.  Ugh.  Send me courage, my friends.

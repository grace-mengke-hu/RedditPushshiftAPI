Needing support and feeling alone right now

I quit 6 days and 16 hours ago. I've already been through some strong triggers and didn't cave this past week. I've been feeling very confident in myself during this process! 

However, my ex-husband just called me to argue with me about something concerning our kid, and I really want to smoke. The call lasted about an hour, and I didn't have any urges to smoke during the call and I was able to keep my emotions in check. After the call ended though, I nearly got up and got in the car to buy a pack. I wrote a diary entry and logged my craving in my Smoke Free app, popped a hard candy in my mouth, and sat outside on my patio to read other people's posts in this subreddit. 

The actual craving has passed, but I have no motivation to do anything else right now. I can't stop thinking about smoking (the "positives" AND the negatives). I literally just earned a badge for not smoking 100 cigarettes from my app as I write this, yet I still want to curl up in bed and avoid life at the moment. 

I can't talk to anyone about what happened presently (my support team members are either working or unavailable), and I am having a hard time moving forward with my progress. How can I "reboot", take note of my achievement, and go on with my day?

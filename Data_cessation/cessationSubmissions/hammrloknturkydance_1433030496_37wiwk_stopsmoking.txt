I stopped for nine months, started back up in September, and just stopped again. I'm really excited.

I'm not sure why I started again. I felt so good being a non-smoker. Now I can't breath, my sinuses are always congested, I have shallow breathing, bad breath. The list goes on. I'm looking forward to being healthy again and being able to breath.

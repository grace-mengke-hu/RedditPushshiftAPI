The struggle to quit

Reddit, sadly I am struggling with the idea of quitting. I have a terrible cold right now and like so many of you before me, continue to smoke during the cold knowing that the symptoms will get worse temporarily as I combine withdrawal with illness. I desperately need motivation. Every cigarette I smoke feels like one step closer to the one that'll eventually do me in. I've read Allan Carr (3x) and I've been doubting my ability after consistently relapsing. Help!

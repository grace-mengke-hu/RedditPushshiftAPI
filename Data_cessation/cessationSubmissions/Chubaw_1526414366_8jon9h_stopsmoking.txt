Serious cravings

Holy shit. I’ve quit for over 6 months. And the past 4 days I’ve had the most INTENSE cravings for a cigarette. I know it won’t be what I want it to be, but holy shit this is horrible. In the time I’ve quit none of my cravings have been this bad! 

Gimme some encouragement!! Haha. Thanks for listening.

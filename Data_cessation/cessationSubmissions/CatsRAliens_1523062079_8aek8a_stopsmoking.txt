Day 2

Okay so I started yesterday.  I cut down to 5 from the usual 20.  Today I got a little angrier than usual (could be the quitting, could be the menopause lol).  So far at 5 with 4 more hours to go in my day so I guess I am going to have to just suck it up and call it the end.  I have decided only I can control me.  I am tired of letting cigarettes control me.  They are inanimate objects.  They don't force me in any way at all to pick them up and smoke them.  They can kiss my... The few puffs at a time that I had today made me feel sick and that makes me happy!  Means I am truly ready.  So tired of them.  38 years of wasting my time.  Done with that!  I sure hope I can keep convincing myself of this!  So ready to be the new me!

What to do when friends are smoking?

I've tried quitting many times, and I'm always the most successful when I'm not around people who smoke. However, cutting every person who smokes out of my life isn't quite what I want to do. What are your strategies for not giving in to temptation when you hang out with your smoker friends?

EDIT: Thanks for the replies! I really like the thought that you can still be social with smokers but realize that you don't have to smoke just to socialize. One of those things that you don't really think about until you quit, I guess.

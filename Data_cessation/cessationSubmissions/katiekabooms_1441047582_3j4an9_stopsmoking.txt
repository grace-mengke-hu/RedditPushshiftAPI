Day 3 and depressed.

I smoked for 13 years before quitting for 4 years, and then starting back up again about 5 months ago during a horribly stressful time.  I've tried to quit numerous times since then and been unsuccessful.  I am quitting cold turkey although I quit with an e-cig last time, when I stayed quit for 4 years.

Instead of being proud of myself for making it 3 days, I just feel sad and depressed.  I have two wonderful children, one is very young and the other is severely autistic and has special needs.  Taking care of them, cleaning, laundry, cooking, and working (self employed) after they go to sleep is all I do.  My husband is wonderful but he works.  As stupid as this sounds (and I know it is stupid) smoking felt like the only time I had for me.  I mostly only smoked at night after kids were in bed, outside on the porch.

I feel like I have nothing to look forward to anymore.  Now when the kids are in bed instead of enjoying a smoke break I just keep doing more chores and work.  I want to be proud of going 3 days without smoking but instead I'm just depressed.  Is this normal?

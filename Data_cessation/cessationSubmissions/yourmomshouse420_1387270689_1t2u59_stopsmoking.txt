14 days with no cigarettes!!

Wow, it's been a crazy 2 weeks, but I feel better. Moody, but better. Anyhow, I just want to say to others, that you can do it!!! I did not think I could do it right now with a wicked amount of stress in my life, but I've done well managing. :) I'm hacking up a storm, how long did some of you cough for? I smoked a pack a day for 24 years. I did cut back in the last year to 1/2 a pack, unless I was having a heavy drinking night, in that case...well you know. ;) 

Anyhow,thanks for listening, and hang in there!!!

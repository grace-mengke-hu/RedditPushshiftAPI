Hey ! new to the crew..

So I called it today that i want to quit , really quit. I smoke for 7 years and in the last 5 a-pack-a-day. Not pround of myself tho. I thought about quitting for 6 months now , tried 2-3 times didn't past the 5 day marker. I'm so frustrated about this , it's starting to get annoying thinking that i can't do it , but i want to so badly... .I hope this time im done for good , so some advice would be very well appreciated. Trying to keep myself strong , i pray that  this time im done for good.

Reset my badge

Got out of hospital yesterday (see earlier Cranberry post) and after the stress of the week justified having a cigarette to "calm my nerves". A pack later and well you've heard the story before.....
Can't believe I fucked up a 32 day quit, but hey I learned a lot (like I can actually quit if I want to) so I'm resetting my badge and having another go at getting my life back. Wish me luck!

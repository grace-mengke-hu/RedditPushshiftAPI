Let me tell you about my co-worker for a minute.

I've said in a post before that this is a quit after a relapse. I can't tell you what a difference it makes in my outlook on quitting. I already know that I can do this. I already know that sometimes it's going to be hard.

One of the reasons for my relapse was that I started hanging out with old friends again (who are smokers) and I started working in a department filled with smokers. They would come in after smoking and smell delicious and that was weird for me. Then I started smoking with them, because this job can be really stressful and I figured one every once in a while wouldn't be a big deal. You can probably fill in the blanks from there!

My co-worker just had to go to the hospital with heart-attack symptoms. They ran some tests and he's okay, but they know now that he did have a minor heart attack not too long ago. He's still experiencing symptoms, but they can't find anything physically wrong. They're fairly sure it's anxiety. 

My boss's husband, who smokes like a chimney, just had a major heart attack, and he's okay now, but he had to quit.

My point is, if you keep smoking even if you don't get cancer, you are putting yourself at a huge risk of having a heart attack. And even if you don't have a heart attack, you're not doing your mental health any favors either, since nicotine consumption causes anxiety and distress. 

Just a friendly reminder of some of the physical and mental reasons we all decided to quit!!

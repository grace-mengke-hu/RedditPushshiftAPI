Attempt #5 ? 6 ? this year. Just going to keep trying.

Title about says it all. Been using Chantix. Helps me quit but I start again. Then I am smoking and taking Chantix. 

Did a reset. Stopped Chantix. 

Started Chantix again yesterday and quit day is Saturday. I will be busy all day so a good distraction.

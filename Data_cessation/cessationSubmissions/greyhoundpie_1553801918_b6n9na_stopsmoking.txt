Go back on the patch or stay off it?

Hi friends

I've been smokefree for 3 weeks (yeah!) and I've been on the patch through a smoking secession program in my city for 4 weeks. Everything is going great and I haven't had cravings since week one. As far as I'm concerned and feel, I'll never smoke another cigarette again.

So, here is my "problem":
About ten days go I started having some minor vertigo issues. It turned out to be something benign and completely different, but  at that time I thought it might have been the patch (14mg) making me dizzy. So last Thursday (one week ago) I took the patch off to see if it would make any changes to my vertigo and I haven't worn it since. So essentially I'm now smoke and nicotine free but what do I do? Like I said, I feel great but I'm also not stupid and after smoking for 19 years, I know that 3 weeks smoke free is "only the beginning". My counsllor (very nice guy) wants me to go back on the patch (step 3, 7mg) because something about receptors in my brain and plain statistics saying that if you're on the patch for 26 weeks (the program I'm on) you have a lot better chances of quitting. I just somehow think it's silly to "pick up" a nicotine habit now when I'm "clean" and feeling good. I keep a nicotine stray in my truck for emergencies but I never use it (still in its wrap).

Anyways, hope this makes sense. What would you guys do? Go back on the patch for another 20-ish week or just stay off everything and manage potential cravings with willpower alone?

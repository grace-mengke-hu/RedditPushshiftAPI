Decided to quit after seeing this subreddit!

I just stumbled upon this subreddit about 1 hour ago and have been reading through all the encouragement everyone gives out!

I've decided to quit just from seeing all the encouragement in this sub! I figure if it's possible for all these people it's possible for me!

Any tips? I figure instead of smoking I'll read a lot more (already read about a book a week) because I find that when I read I don't think about smoking at all. Just started a job (I'm a college student but needed a part time gig) I worked 4 hours a few days ago and went through that entire 4 hour shift without smoking! Although I craved it like crazy so had to have one afterwards. Its night time where I am so I'm hoping since going to sleep soon I will get at least a 12 hour start!

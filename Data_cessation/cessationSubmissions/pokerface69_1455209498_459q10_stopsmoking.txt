slipped after 5 days :'( :'( Will I have full blown withdrawal ?

I quit 5 days ago and was going good. But today after dinner I smoked one with a friend who smokes regularly :'( I feel so bad and discouraged but I am going to continue my quit. I have sent message to reset my badge but I want to ask is will I have to go through all the withdrawal again?

A month today

One month for me today, feeling positive but like my head is full of cotton wool! Funny feeling but heck it's got to be better than smoking and feeling lethargic, anxious and having low confidence, all of which have gone since I stopped.

Thanks so much to everyone on here for the help, I don't post much but I come on here EVERY day when I need support. You're all amazing and I'm so pleased to have such great people to read about conquering their addiction to nicotine. 

Keep up the great work everyone!

I'm going cold turkey today. Please help.

Been smoking 4 or so years. Smoking what is hopefully my last one(s) right now. I've failed more times than I can count. I beat something white but I can't beat this. I've tried cold turkey/weaning/patches/gum/e-cigs. I've failed every single time. I crave the taste every single moment I'm awake. It's cheap enough to smoke 1-2 packs a day depending on my mood. So I've never actually wanted to quit until now. I just knew I needed to. It's killing my teeth, breath, and me slowly please help me out.

 Any tips any warnings anything you pros with more then 2 days under your belt please help me quit with any knowledge you can give.

"you're always so stressed"

Last night someone said to me "you are always so stressed or freaking out about something"

And I realized that is way too true. I always am. I was stressing about bullshit on the train this morning, stressing about things at work, stressing about more things on the train home and don't even get me started on the drive back from the train.

Here's to hoping no more cigarettes will help me reduce my stress! They will be at least one less thing to stress about ha though I do still have the health issues that they may bring to stress about :/

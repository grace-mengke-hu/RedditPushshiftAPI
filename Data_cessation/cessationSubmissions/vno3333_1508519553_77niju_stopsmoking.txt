Day 2 smoke free

I know I barely have anything to brag about, but I think posting on here will help motivate me. I'm feeling a bit irritated this morning. I spoke to my boyfriend about how I'm quitting, something he's wanted me to do since we started dating over a year ago. I finally felt like I was ready and it is my choice. When I told him his first reaction wasn't one of support, but instead he told me how he won't have ashes in his car anymore and it won't be like he's kissing an ashtray. He's being so unsupportive and it's hurting my feelings, and he's flipping the situation and tying to make it about himself. Idk how to approach the situation other than by being upset with him. I know I'm doing this for myself, but I need the support of my loved ones.

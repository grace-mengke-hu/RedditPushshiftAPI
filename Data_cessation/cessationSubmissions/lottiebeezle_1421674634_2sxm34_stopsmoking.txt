I wake up with a sore throat every morning

Every morning I have a sore throat, not terribly painful but uncomfortable, it goes away after a couple of hours. It's nothing I am worried about and don't think its strep because its gone by the afternoon.

 I still have a bad cough, which comes and goes throughout the day.

This cough and sore throat are actually giving me motivation to not smoke again as I believe they are side effects of my years of smoking 

After 3 ish weeks does anyone else have similar problems?
Thanks

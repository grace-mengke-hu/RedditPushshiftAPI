Help! 2 weeks without a cigarette, but vaping instead

Last time I had a cigarette was December 29th. This is my longest streak without a cigarette and the urges have been very easy to pass. So much that I actually am starting to hate the taste and smell of cigarettes. 

I have been vaping 3mg of nicotine to curve my addiction. And although I feel healthier and more alive I still want to ease off the nicotine for good. 

I have friends telling me that I should vape with nicotine for at least 6 months before I should cut vaping for good. Do you guys have any advice, or should I follow what my friends say?

Wake up call

"I only smoke 7 a day,  I only smoke American Spirit, I hate every minute of it ". You would think that I could easily quit.  Not so.  I was smoke free for 16 years and started back.  Stress.  We have to have something to blame it on, no?  So I  have a mini stroke yesterday and facing the possibility of a full blown one in the future.  It's time. It's past time. I look at the posts and accomplishments here and believe it can be done.  I'm here hoping to find the community to help me through it as well as share as I go and maybe help someone else.  My plan is to smoke this last one (single cigg not pack) and not buy anymore. Wish me luck, send out good quit vibes, tips and encouragement are welcome.  We can do this!!!!  Thanks

Today I quit.

Hi guys,

I'm 22 and since I'm 16, I'm a regular majiruana  smoker and cigarette too. I've chosed today to quit smoking cause it's really messing with my emotion and my life. And I just realised that I was addict more than really enjoying the thing.

So I have my last cigarette on my desk and I wished myself to not buy anymore, I threw out my grinder that I have since now 5 years but I can't threw out my pipes handmade in clay by a friend.. It's memories.

I'm just looking for help and supportive words since I'm a poor guy living alone and I really wish this will help me.

Thanks for reading.

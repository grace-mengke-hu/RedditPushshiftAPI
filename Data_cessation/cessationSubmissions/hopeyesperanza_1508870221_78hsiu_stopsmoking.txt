One year smoke free!

The cravings when they come now are very rare, but still possessed of a strength and intensity that makes me repeat the mantra I have repeated every time since I started this: "You got through the first 10 cravings, and those were the hardest. You will get through this one."
Understand that each craving is its own battle, that's been the trick for me. One year, one fucking year. I smoked for a really, really long fucking time, and this wasn't my first attempt at quitting. For those thinking of quitting or trying to quit the habit remember, its a marathon, not a race, and you GOT THIS! YOU CAN DO IT!

Just tell yourself Stop!

It's not that hard to stop if you genuinely want to stop .. 
I've been tellin myself I want to stop everyday for the past two years but I didn't accually want to stop I enjoyed smoking . But I developed this bad cough and I relised that's it's not going to get better and decided to stop but this time I accually wanted to stop and now I've been off 20 days the last time I tried to take a pull from a smoke I nearly got sick and my throat couldn't handle it ..

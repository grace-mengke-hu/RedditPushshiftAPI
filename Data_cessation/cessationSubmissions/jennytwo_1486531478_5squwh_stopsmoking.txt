I'm a bad mom now!!

I am 5 weeks into the quitting process-first week a breeze bc I was in the hospital for pneumonia, second week not to bad just annoying but since I was still recovering and sleeping a lot I got through it fine. Then I started feeling better and cheated a couple times. It tasted awful but didn't care. One turned into one a week to twice a week then this weekend I had 4 or 5! Now I have to start the whole process over again! Now I am a moody irritable mom and hate myself for it!! My poor 3 year old has no clue why I'm snapping at her so much and I need to get myself together fast!

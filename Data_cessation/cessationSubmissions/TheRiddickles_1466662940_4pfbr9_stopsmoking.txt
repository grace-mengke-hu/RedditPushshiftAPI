5 days down.

So I smoked my last cigarette 5 days ago.  I tried quitting in March and lasted three days.  Worst of the physical withdrawls is over seems like, but man is it hard not to smoke after a meal.  Those were my favorite smokes haha.  Not sure how you guys get those little flairs next to your name?  

Anyway I'm celebrating my birthday this weekend with all my friends, and we'll be drinking.  Always loved to smoke when I was drinking but I think I'll be fine.  

*EDIT: Nevermind about the flair.  Found the badgebot : ]

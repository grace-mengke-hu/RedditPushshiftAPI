Dad died last September and I started smoking. Having trouble quitting. Need advice

My dad suddenly died last September and I started smoking. I've tried for a while to quit but it's incredibly hard. I get very anxious and feel sick. Smoking has been a major crutch for me. Breathing exercises don't help. I'm trying the patch but that doesn't truly replace smoking. If anyone has advice on the emotional aspect of quitting and what's really helped you overcome the habit, I'd love some advice.

Today is the day.

I've decided that today is the day I quit.  I've tried to quit numerous times before, for a wide range of reasons.  As I'm writing this post I'm staring down at a near-empty pack of L&M menthols; and quite frankly, I'm disgusted by them.  I've been smoking nearly a pack a day for 8 years now (a full third of my life).  I first tried a cigarette when I was eleven, but didn't make it a habit until the age of 16.  During previous attempts to quit, my resolve tended to hold strong for at least a couple of weeks.  After that, I always forgot about all of my reasons for quitting.   I would always convince myself that, after a couple weeks, I would be able to smoke a single cig out at the bars and would be alright; most of you can understand that I was very wrong in thinking such a thing.  My largest foreseeable obstacle is that my girlfriend smokes as well.  Any advice for how to cope with that will be greatly appreciated.  She and I live together, as such it will be impossible to avoid seeing her smoke on the porch (or smelling the aftermath).  I've tried quitting cold turkey in the past and have realized that such a method will not work for me.  I have to, temporarily,  replace cigarettes and wean off.  As such, I will not request a badge until I'm nicotine free.  I just ordered an eCig (I know, I know. .most of you will hate me for it).  I'm simply using it as a temporary replacement so that I can reduce, and ultimately eliminate, usage of nicotine.  Hate me if you will; I've put serious thought into this and have decided that it will be better for me to wean off of eCigs than off of analogs.  I just wanted to share my thoughts somewhere.

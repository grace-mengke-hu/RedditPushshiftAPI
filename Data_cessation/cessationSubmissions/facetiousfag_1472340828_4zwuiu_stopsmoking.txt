Questions for successful quitters

Do you constantly have to fight cravings? Do you need to remove yourself from situations where people are smoking around you? Do you live in fear that you will relapse?

I only used to have a dart when I was drunk. Then I started drinking one or two drinks after work with a mate most days, and I'd have a dart with him. That turned into me buying a packet to smoke alone when I drink. That turned into smoking without drinking. That turned into me coming home from work at lunch or waking up extra early to smoke before I start. It's only been about 3 months.

I hate it and always told myself I wasn't addicted, but I know I am. I've just gone cold turkey, but I every time I see someone smoking I just wanna go and ask for one. I crave the head high and the  full-bodied mellow feeling I get from smoking.

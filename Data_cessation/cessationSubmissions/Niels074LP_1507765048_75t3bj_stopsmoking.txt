As I am Smoking my last cigarette...

I sit here ready to go to bed and wake up a non smoker tomorrow. I have been looking forward to this moment for a while now and I feel ready. I am sure I am going to make it, this last cigarette is making me reflect on things. How I got this nasty addiction, how my doctor told me to quit after every longuetest, how I feel tired all the time. How I choose to throw away money to die an early and most painful death. I am ready guys, its not going to be easy, but I am going to do this. Just wanted to get this off my chest, I havent told Anyone, but they will find out soon enough.

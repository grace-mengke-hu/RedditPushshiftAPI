Quitting for health

Ok so, I suffered a pulmonary embolism last week, as a smoker I know this is a factor. I stopped the day after but gave in after 5 days after a little breakdown. I haven't had one now for 2 days but I'm struggling alot. I keep thinking of my health but I'm also getting very angry and emotional. Terrified to smoke but also want one so bad.

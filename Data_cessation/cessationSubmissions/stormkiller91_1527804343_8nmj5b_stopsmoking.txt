From now on, i'll never smoke again in my life!

Goodevening all,

first of all I want to tell you that I've just smoked my last cigarette ever! Im done with my addaction, and today the first of june, is the day I'm taking my life back! 9 years of smoking, and never thinking I would be able to quit!

Its been a month now that Ive really wanted to quit, so Ive seeked professional help, found this amazing subreddit, and downloaded the stop smoking app. 

It'll be a hard time getting through this weekend, getting rid of all the nicotine. After that the cleansing of my body... But I've got you! And we can do this!

I'm so happy I can start this beautiful day, by saying: I'll not smoke today! Thank you for all the future support needing! It'll much appreciating!

Positiv Vibrations from the Netherlands!

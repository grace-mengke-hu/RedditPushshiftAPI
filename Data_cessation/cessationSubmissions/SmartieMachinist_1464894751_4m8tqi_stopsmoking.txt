Chest pains after I left smoking.Is it normal?

Hey guys! 
A friend of mine told me about this sub-reddit and maybe I was thinking about you guys as you know better. So,I stopped smoking and it has been a week and I'm getting chest pains.Is it normal? Or should I go get a check-up from the doc?
Please advise.

My brain makes me do things

Hey all,

I'm working on quitting, I smoked from 16-24, got up to about a pack a day.  I originally quit by writing down why I wanted to quit and carrying that paper around to remind me what I had to lose, and that I wanted to quit.

Now I'm 31 and I started again a few months ago, once I bought a pack I quickly slid back into the habit and addiction.  It's only going to get harder and I don't want to go back to smoking in the freezing cold outside in the winter.  I just want to get over it before all the terrible health implications start to really set in again.

So I have resolved to quit, I want to stop, I want to go back to where I was where the thought of smoking was completely out of my system.  It didn't take that long initially, after a month, going back seemed impossible.  Now I have a practical problem though.  I can stop on the weekend, I have minor withdrawl symptoms, fatigue and crankiness, but nothing horrible.

It's at work where I feel like I lose control.  Since I've been thinking about why I start again and again I realized it's that my brain convinces me, it's ok to smoke today, or this week, and I'll just stop later.  I can actually feel my mind convincing me to do something, and I feel powerless to stop it.  Once the brain starts to come up with excuses or reasons to give it a few more days, I can feel myself resigning and giving up.

I need to figure out how to preempt this thinking, I know it will be coming, and I need to come up with some physical ritual to combat it, to get me out of my mind.  It makes me aggravated that I have so little control over myself when it comes to this, and I just need to figure out how to get through a single day at work so I can say that I've actually beaten this one circumstance that claims victory on me every weekday.

I have done some maths, i have smoke over 200k cigarettes

And i think its enough. I am 32yo, smoke for 14 years 35-40 cigarettes a day so about 204.000 in my life. I  have done several fail atemps to quit, i have try every NRT there is out, vapes,  but i think im over. I'm not saying i will quit totay or tomorrow, but soon. I want to be on the  right frame of mind so i will not fail again.
The hardest part of my quitting has to do that i have connect every aspect of my life with smoking.
I have also read Allen's Carr book several times and seen the movie. The truth is that at the end of the book some times i get bored or distracted, even if i feel that it's not the most important part of the book.
But this time i am gonna be ready, i will smoke my last packs of cigarettes in the next few days and its over.
Merry Christmas and a Happy  new Year everyone!!

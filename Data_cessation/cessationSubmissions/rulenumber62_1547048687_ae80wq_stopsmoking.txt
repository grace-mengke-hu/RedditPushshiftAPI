Day 1

Had 3 this morning, patch on at 930am. 

Has anyone had success using Quit Genius app? 

Nicotine was the last vice (I’m not counting coffee on account of being a parent).  

Hoping this is my final attempt, and to quit for good. For cravings, I’ve chugged a glass of water, taken a walk, chewed a toothpick. Any other suggestions?

All Checked Out Good

Went to the doctor to get a check up since I’ve quit smoking.  Also had a Spirometry test.  My breathing is good, my breathing test came out good, my lungs are clear, and all checked out great.  No changes in my lungs since my last X-ray (as a smoker I would get one every other year).   

Since I quit smoking I’ve insisted in my mind the damage was done, I can’t breath, I’ve put myself in a situation where the damage is not fixable, etc.  It’s why I made my appointment.  But when I left, the relief I felt was awesome and the emotion was overwhelming.  I smoked 29 years and I feel I dodged a bullet.   


Tomorrow I’ll be 2 months smoke free and couldn’t feel better about it.

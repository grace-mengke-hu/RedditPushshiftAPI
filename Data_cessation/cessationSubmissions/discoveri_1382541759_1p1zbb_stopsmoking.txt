201 days!

I forgot to post yesterday when I hit the 200 day mark so I'm finally getting around to it now.

My cravings are nonexistant right now. I have 1 smoking dream a month and those haven't been anywhere near as strong as they were 3 months ago. I'm feeling pretty good these days. How's it going with you my fellow nonsmokers?

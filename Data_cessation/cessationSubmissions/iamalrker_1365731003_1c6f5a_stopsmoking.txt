First really challenging moment

Today is the first day that I really wanted to smoke.  I've been using the patch and it's been fairly easy, but today, as in right now, I just got some exciting news and typically I would sedate my excitement with a cigarette.  This is the last thing I would have thought to be the hardest but, surprisingly enough, getting this moment is the most challenging one yet.  Anyone else find surprising times that were the toughest?

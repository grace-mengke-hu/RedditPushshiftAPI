3 weeks in and I want you all to know it gets better

I don't have much to say, just this: despite how difficult and impossible quitting seems, it's possible. Just work on it one day at a time. Good luck.

Edit: My goodness. I didn't expect such a response from this post. I logged back into this account, which is a secondary for me, and was overwhelmed by the response from everyone. The reason I logged back in was because today was a hard day to say 'no' to cigarettes. I didn't crumble, but I thought about it more than what has become 'normal' in these last few days. The response I got here, in my inbox, really really really changed the way I'm feeling- knowing others are doing the same struggle. Thank you kind, random strangers, for your overwhelming response. It helped me, a total stranger, today, and I appreciate it.

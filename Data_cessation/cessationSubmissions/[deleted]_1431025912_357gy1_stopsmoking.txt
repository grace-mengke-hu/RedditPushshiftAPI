Cold turkey tomorrow

After 27 years as a smoker, a few weeks back I tried to cut down in hopes of being on the road to quitting. First attempt ever.  Cutting back went well, but when I stopped putting the effort in, my usage crept right back to where it was. I was using ecigs to help with the cravings. I realized that I'm not doing myself any favors with the ecig, and that cold turkey is going to have to be the way it goes. So tomorrow I try again, all in. I am actually pretty excited to get started on stopping!!

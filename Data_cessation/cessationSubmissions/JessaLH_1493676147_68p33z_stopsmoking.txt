I keep lying to myself..

I just had to move out of where I was staying and back with my mother who has no electricity and really no food or anything. Just had to pack all my stuff and move and I am upset and crying and keep telling myself if I just smoke then I will stop crying and calm down. I know I save money by quitting so I tell myself that if I start smoking again I won't buy a pack and that I'll just get them from someone and it's bs and I'm just so stressed and conflicted. Really trying hard here though not to smoke...

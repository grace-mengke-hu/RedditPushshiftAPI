Frustrated.

So after 18 years of smoking, I quit cigarettes in February. I have used patches, gum, vape pens. On three occasions (social events) I had part of a cigarette bummed from a friend, but did not find it enjoyable. I'm down to the lowest dose of the nicotine patches.

However, even trying a slow weaning (this is my first serious quit attempt, ever), nothing feeks like it is worth it. I've gained 15 lbs, I'm irritable and just a nightmare to be around most of the time. I tried to go off the nicotine entirely and ended up in a place where I was literally having serious suicidal ideation. I did not pick up cigarettes, but I did put on a patch and chew a piece of gum.

I don't feel fitter, or better, and the only tangible benefit I've gotten is the constant smoker's "ahem" cough is gone. 

Seemingly this should be reward enough, but I find myself questioning if a longer life of feeling fat, slow, and miserable is worth the extra years.

Likewise the financial bennies have failed to materialize. My husband and I had been using self-rolled cigs (that I hated the taste of) for less than $20 a week. Despite no longer purchasing these (gum & etc has all been gifted), we are still broke. So no celebratory anything on that note.

TL;DR: Whine! After 2 months quit, feel like I am experiencing all the drawbacks and none of the rewards of quitting.

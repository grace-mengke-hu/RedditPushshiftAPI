Finally reading Easyway.

I've quit many times, sometimes it lasted months, sometimes even years. But I always come back to smoking. I figured I should finally get to reading Allen Carr's Easyway to Stop Smoking. It's been recommended to me before & I have always fooled myself in to thinking 'I've quit before by myself, I can do it again'. This is obviously not the case, as I have never truly been a non-smoker. 

So I suppose I would like to hear your experiences with reading Easyway. Thanks in advance! :)

I did it! A full day without smoking

I've been wanting to do this for a long time. First time in over 9 years that I went a single day without smoking and the first time since I started smoking that I did it on purpose (I had a couple day break after I got my wisdom teeth pulled 9 years ago). I really hope I can keep it up. We'll see.

EDIT: Thanks for the love guys. I made it through Day 2 as well.

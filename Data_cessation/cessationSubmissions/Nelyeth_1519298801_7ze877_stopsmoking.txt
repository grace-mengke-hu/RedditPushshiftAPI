I just had a rough argument with my mother because I refused to buy her a pack. Now I feel like an asshole.

Backstory : I'm a 22 years-old, living with my mother until I can afford to move out. I'm a non-smoker myself, but my mother smokes heavily. I went out to buy groceries, and my mother told me "can you stop by the bar-tabac [yay, France] and buy me a pack, so I don't have to go out ?". It was the first time she's ever asked me this, and I bluntly refused. 

Fast-forward a bit, I'm back with the groceries and no pack, and she lashes out at me because "it makes no sense, you're just being an asshole". Then she stormed out of the house to buy it.

After taking a step back, I agree I was highly illogical, especially since I wouldn't think twice about buying a beer. But still, the mental block's here, and there's no way I would buy her a pack. I hear her cough (*bad* cough) every morning when she wakes up, for fuck's sake. 

Now I have no idea how I'm supposed to defuse the situation, and even though I *feel* justified, logically thinking, I'm the one being an ass. 

Thoughts on this ? Thanks.

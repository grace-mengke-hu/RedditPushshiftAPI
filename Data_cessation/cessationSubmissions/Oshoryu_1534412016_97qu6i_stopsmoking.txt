Wrestling with a demon who refuses to go away

Hey everyone, I need some moral support I feel.  

Quit Day was Tuesday so now on Day 3. Although giving up is something I've wanted to do for a while now, I was kinda pushed into it without really having a chance to set a date in the near future to mentally prepare myself for.  

Anyway, I'm on patches (25mg) and using a vape too, (13mg nicotine) my thinking is that the patches will regulate the nicotine levels, and the vape can serve as a 'top up' to stem the cravings and also the physical, 'what to do with my hands' part.  

Annoyingly, with all the nicotine I'm getting, it doesn't feel like much of a replacement for the real thing, and cravings are still hitting me hard. I've tried the Nicorette mints and the lozenges, but they just taste completely foul and leave a really awful taste in my mouth, is that the point?  

It seems harder at work, last two nights at home have been Ok, I feel more tired, more irritable, more hungry. Guess that's normal?

I do feel like everytime it starts to get easier, that thought is countered by a stronger craving.

I have my bacci on me so I know if things get really bad I can always have one, but I am saying no to myself. Leaving the bacci at home, or binning it would drive me even more crazy as the choice to say no would not be under my control anymore, and that's important to me.  

On Tuesday I had two rollies, yesterday, I had one. I'm aiming for zero today.  

Wish me luck!

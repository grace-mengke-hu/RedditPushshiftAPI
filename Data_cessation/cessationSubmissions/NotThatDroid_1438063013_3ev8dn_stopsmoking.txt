I'm ready to try again

For the past year I've been trying on and off again to quit.

However, it never really worked because I didn't really get myself to WANTING to quit. I didn't have the motivation. I didn't mind the health risks and I had enough money to support my addiction.

Now, however, I am going to buy my first house and need to save some money for furniture and will just generally need more money for groceries and stuff.

So saving my spendings on cigarettes (about â‚¬230 per month) will easily cover my grocery costs!

I still think it's bad that the health risks don't seem to be that much of a motivator to me, but money is... but I'd figure; doesn't matter how I do it, this time I'm in it for the long run :D

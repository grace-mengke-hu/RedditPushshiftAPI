Day 3-ish...

Its so hard to quit, but I want it so bad. 
I want to spend the money on something more fun than smoking, however it is great to smoke..


How long does this feeling last? These urges to smoke, not even stressful situations, it is just ever present. I have not had a second that I thought: "fuck smoking, go away". 

Next weekend I have a big ass bday party where like 90% is a heavy smoker, how am I going to cope with that..? Just thinking about it is horrible. I am confident that I might relapse after a few drinks...


**--- Something else ---**

*IF* i relapse, does anyone here have any experience with [Varenicline \(ChampixÂ®\)](https://www.quitnow.ca/tools-and-resources/quitting-medications/varenicline-champix)

Bye..

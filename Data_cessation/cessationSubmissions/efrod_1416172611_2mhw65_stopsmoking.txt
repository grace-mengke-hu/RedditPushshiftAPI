Still smoke free!

I went to a Friendsgiving dinner last night, and most of our friends are smokers. Had a huge craving, but managed to stay strong and not smoke. I'm doing it! It feels like it is going to stick this time, thank you to everyone sharing. It helps to know there are other people doing the same thing and succeeding.

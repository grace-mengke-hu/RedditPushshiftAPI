Brain Fog

Hey guys , not sure if this is caused by not smoking but currently I’m facing some brain fog , focus and disorientation issue. I wonder if anyone is facing this and what do you do to make yourself be more focused. It’s not that it makes me want to start smoking or anything. Just feeling disoriented, thanks for any input.

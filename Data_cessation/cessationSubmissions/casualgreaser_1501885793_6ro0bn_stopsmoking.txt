I am done with this bullshit.

I fucking hate feeling guilty for slowly killing myself. I'm 20 and I've been smoking for the past 4 years of my life. Spending money on packs gives me a hard time but not nearly as much as trying to justify smoking. I hate having to convince myself that my life sucks just so I can smoke a cig. This isn't my first attempt but I've never been so dedicated before. Threw away all of my stash including my Zippo. I got so amazingly mad at myself that I didn't even consider giving it away, I want this bullshit part of my life to end as quickly as possible.

Just one hour into my new life, already feeling happier. No more guilt, no more manipulating my own feelings. No more feeling too lazy and tired to do anything at all.

FUCK SMOKING, I AM SO DONE.

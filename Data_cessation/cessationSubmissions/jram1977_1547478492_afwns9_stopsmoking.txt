It’s hard but I really want to quit.

13 days cigarette free it’s been pretty tough after 27 years of smoking a lot of different things make me want to smoke like when I first wake up, after I eat, when I’m driving or taking a break and those aren’t really because of cravings it just became habit part of everyday routine. When something stresses me out or upsets me seems to be when I crave one the most and I try to tell myself that I could just have one but so far I’ve held strong because I really want to quit for so many reasons.

Almost done with day 2.

I'm almost done with day 2. Not the first time I have tried to quit and so far it hasn't been that bad. I'm still struggling with cravings after dinner though. The others I seem to have absolutely no problem with. The cravings that hit me after dinner are driving me mad. Why is that?

Help! Recently quit drinking and smoking is next. Any advice? [Read please]

So I just recently turned 24 and stopped drinking, am currently 61 days sober. I have been smoking since I was 16, and I feel like I need to give that up too.

I am currently noticing some hints of periodontal problems and I can only assume these are caused by my pack-a-day habit.

I brush my teeth every day and follow with warn water rinse and mouthwash. Admittedly, I don't floss like I should. I've always been kind of anal about dental appearance and care, so finding my teeth start to subtly shift at 24 is scaring the bejeesus out of me.

I've pushed the thought off for a while, thinking there was an easier way, but I am at the conclusion that smoking is and will continue to be the cause of my dental woes. Having no dental insurance, smoking cessation seems like a cheaper remedy.

So friends, how did you guys quit personally? I need advice because I want to start stopping [heh] ASAP. Patches? Gums? I have a vaporizer but I know those are kinda in murky waters scientifically so I'm not sure if that will help/hurt my teeth.

Thanks in advance!

What are things I can do to help my body heal and reverse damage I have done ?

Im in the process of starting to stop smoking. I know my lungs are filled with junk.

I am walking and eating healthier as part of this process.

Are there any recommended things such as supplements, vitamins, hot showers,  hot teas

TIA

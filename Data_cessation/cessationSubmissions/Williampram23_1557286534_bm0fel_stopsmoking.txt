How far have you gone for a puff of cigarette?

For example (warning, very fucking cringey), for me I used to be very dependant on cigarette. Waking up in the morning, smoke, after breakfast, smoke, after coffee, smoke, lunch break, smoke. I remember during my college years whenever I didn’t have a cigarette I would walk around the campus a few times looking for smokers and bumming cigarettes from them. If that didn’t work it was picking up butts from the floor which was the lowest I’ve gone. I would roll out the tobaccos from the butts in my balcony (my own cigarettes), buy a pack of rolling papers and roll a cigarette from the old tobacco.

Looking back as a non smoker I cringe everytime.

This is the last time. ...I hope.

Here I am on hour 45.  This isn't the first time I've been here but I need it to be the last.  Every time I fail and pick back up, I swear... it gets harder and harder to quit.  
  
I've quit opiates.  
I've quit drinking.  
I've quit biting my nails.  
I've lost a ridiculous amount of weight.  
  
Yet I'm terrified quitting smoking will unravel everything and I'll go back to everything I've worked so hard on.  Sigh.  I don't know what the point of this post is.  Maybe just to write some stuff down because unfortunately I'm doing this quitting thing ENTIRELY alone.  I've read "the book", I look at peoples motivational posts, I read what I can to assure that all the physical and emotional withdrawl symptoms I'm having are normal...  
  
Yet, it sucks just being ENTIRELY alone.  My family doesn't know, my partner isn't quitting and I have no friends.  I'm home all day long.  Blah blah blah.  This isn't making sense, just need to get this out here.  I'm super tired today.  Super super super tired.  And REALLY cold?  It's hot outside, I know that.  My headache has not subsided whatsoever yet.  I've had enough water to drown myself, really.  Trying not to overeat.  Trying to work out but I have a bum arm right now.  Ugh ugh ugh.  
  
Just... fuck.  
But again... hour 45.  So that's something.

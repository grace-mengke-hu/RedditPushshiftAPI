First time going cold turkey.

I've tried and failed and tried and failed for probably 2.5 years, I'm only 23 and have been smoking since ~19. I baked before I smoked, so every time I tried to quit by vaping, a month later I'd be smoking again. Well, a couple weeks ago I smoked my last cigarette and was going to try vaping...again. But, it happened to fall out of my coat pocket and break. So, I said screw it and quit it all then and there. I'm so done with smoking and smelling awful and the headaches and the crappy lung capacity. I had a bad habit of bumming smokes off people too, when I was trying to quit, and I haven't had the urge to! There isn't a day that goes by where I don't regret starting. But here's to the (almost) 3rd week, first time cold turkey, every!

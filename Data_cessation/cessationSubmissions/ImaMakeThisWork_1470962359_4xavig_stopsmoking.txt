What? Half a year already?

Welp, I guess I've pretty much made it. No cravings, no need to smoke. Didn't think I could, though. Yet here I am, smoke free for 180 days.
Was it tough? In the beginning, yeah. Did it get easier? Hell yeah, and very fast.

Don't be discouraged by other people's experiences. Your experiences are up to you, and you don't need several failed quits to successfully quit. You only need to actually *want* to quit. Make a commitment and stick to it.

What is the best quitting mindset?

Hi, everyone!

This is my first time here. Congratulations to everyone who has quit; you are all very inspiring!

I smoke about 10-15 cigarettes a day (sometimes more if I have exams or other stressful situations) and I've been wanting to quit for a while now. I've tried a few times, and each time I gave in within a few hours because the stress of forcing myself to not think about smoking was too much, that I had to smoke to stop thinking about it.

I'm wondering if I'm starting off on the "wrong" foot, or from a less-than-successful mindset, or if I'm just weak-willed.

My reasons for wanting to quit are as follows (in order of importance):

- I don't want to have health problems. I'm young (early 20's) and I've been smoking for 4 years, so I feel like it's better to quit now than later.

- I'm a very proud person who highly values self-control, strong wills, and owning up to one's mistakes (although it doesn't mean I'm good at it). And I really do despise myself for having done this to my body, and for being stupid enough to keep smoking in the first place. I want to prove to myself that I can overcome this, and that I am in control of my body and brain.

- I stink, and it makes me self-conscious in public. I also think smoking looks trashy.

There are other smaller reasons, but these are my main reasons.

Of course, I'm not going to quit trying just because I might feel that I don't *really* want to quit yet, but **I'm asking those of you who have succeeded what your motivations were, and what really made you determined to quit.**

I know it's really my battle that I have to fight myself, but I feel so lost and weak even though I feel like I have all the motivations in the world to quit.

Let me know if I've ignored any Subreddit rules, and I'll amend. And I really hope some of you have some advice for me or stories you can share with me!

"You never stop craving"

After posting here, I went to work at 3pm and actually managed to go INTO work before smoking prior. This is a big deal for me because I take a hour long bus ride to work, and don't have my 15 minute break until 3 hours. At 7pm I was talking to my co worker whom is a smoker and has tried to quit. She said that she quit for two months and the craving ultimately never went away. After that I got extremely anxious and convinced myself to go buy cigarettes. 

Anyway, is this true for everyone? Did she just not fully want to quit? It's gotten me back to smoking, even if it's just an excuse.

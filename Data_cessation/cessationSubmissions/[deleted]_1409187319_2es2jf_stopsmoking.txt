The first three days are tough

On my forth day. The first three days are tough. But I feel the worst is over. I imagine things will be easier and easier. Time is on my side.

In just 3 days, my heart rate drop from 85bpm to 65. And I feel more confident about everything I do. It's awesome. 

Stay strong, my friend (ie internet random strangers who share a common goal with me). We can do it.

Help!

Today is my day two and it has been awful. Completely bombed my math exam. I am starting to think that maybe this is not the right time to quit, but then again is there even a right time to quit? The problem is I'm so stressed out at school and I used cigarettes as a crutch to help that. I have no idea what to do right now it seems so easy to light up.

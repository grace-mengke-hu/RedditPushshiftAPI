I'm so sick and tired of this.


Hi guys, I've been smoking for almost 4 years now. I smoke about a full pack of 20 a day.

There are two main problems with this:
a) I spend exactly one half of my money on smoking, which makes me unable to do anything else except barely affording food. Very annoying.

b) Smoking generally makes me tired and high (unable to focus) all the time, so I don't really study anything throughout the semester unless I absolutely have to. I can't believe I haven't dropped out yet.

I tried to quit many times, first time I quit cold turkey for a week, I fell into depression because of it so I started smoking again, the second time I managed to do it, also cold turkey, for 12 days, then something annoying happened to me in the 12th day and i was mad so I smoked 1 cig that day then gradually started smoking again.

I need your opinion on this, I really I need to, I have to quit, but the mere thought of me quitting scares me and stresses me out and makes me smoke more!

I can only do it cold turkey, no nicotine substitute.

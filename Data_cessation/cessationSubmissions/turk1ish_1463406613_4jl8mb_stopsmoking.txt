Went on a date with a smoker last night

As the title suggests, i went on a date last night. She was a smoker so as you can imagine, that wasn't easy for me.

The real truth is, i didn't have a single puff. In fact, i didn't even want one. Just the smell alone grossed me out.

We ended up hooking up (10/10 after quitting - would recommend) but this morning i tasted ash in my mouth.

I wish i could apologize to every non-smoker i ever kissed in my time as a smoker. Its gross.

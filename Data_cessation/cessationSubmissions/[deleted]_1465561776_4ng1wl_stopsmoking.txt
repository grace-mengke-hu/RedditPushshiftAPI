Relapse after a year and a half

Hi everyone, this is my first post to this sub. I could really use some support right now. I quit cold turkey in 2014 after getting pregnant and I've remained strong for over a year and half...until this past week. I've been under a lot of stress at home (unemployed husband, supporting the family by myself right now) and then my grandfather died very unexpectedly. He just dropped out of the blue. We were close with him and it devastated my whole family. I've been in a really dark place and one day, I guess I was kind of on autopilot or something but I found myself walking out of the store with a pack of cigs. I've been smoking half a cig here, half a cig there. Sometimes going over a day in between but I can feel myself slipping back into that old habit. I'm aware that my nicotine addicted brain is already trying to trick me. I'm not strong right now, mentally, but the guilt is killing me. If anyone has advice I would love to hear it!

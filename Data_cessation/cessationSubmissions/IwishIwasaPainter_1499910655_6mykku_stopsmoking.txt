I am smoking excessively for 1 year, decided to quit.

Hello today I did my last cigarette since I decided to quit. I am smoking excessively for the past year, I would do a 30g in 5-6 days so I assume I was smoking around 180g per month, so I've smoked around 2kilos in this 1 year. I decided to quit mainly because smoking costs me a lot and I get tired really easily right now which is really annoying, I've also seen increase in anxiety and dizziness (which is kind of funny since I am smoking mostly in social gatherings to relax) . I've checked some sites on what happens to my body after I quit smoking and I have a question;
I assume most sites talk about chronic smokers and not someone like me who only smokes for 1 year (I used to smoke before too for 1 year but it would be 1 pack per 3-4 months) so I guess I should see some results easier and not expect 5-15 years for my lungs/body to fully recover ?.

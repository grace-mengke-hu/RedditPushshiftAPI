First smoking nightmare

I'm at 3 days, 11 hours and 33 minutes right now.


Last night I had my first smoking nightmare. I was driving after I had just gotten off of work. A friend called and asked if I could pick them up a pack of cigarettes so I did, and for some reason just took one out and lit up. It was like I had forgotten I had quit until I was halfway done and put it out. It was so real. After putting it out I remember feeling terrible, with this horrible "what have I done!" feeling. I hated myself for wasting all the hard work I'd gone through in my first three days and that I'd have to just do again now.


Then my cat jumped on me and woke me up. Oh man. I was so freakin' happy that was a dream. I feel like now I *really* know I am never going to smoke again. I never want to feel like I did in that dream, and I know none of you do, either. We can all do this.

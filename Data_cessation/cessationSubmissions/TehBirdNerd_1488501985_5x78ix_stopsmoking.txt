Perception of time?

It's been six months since I quit smoking, and it seems like time has taken on a very different quality since I quit. I honestly can't believe it's been six months, because the time has flown by like never before. Has anyone else had a similar experience? Maybe it's because I'm no longer measuring time by the number of cigarettes I'm smoking (not that I deliberately did that, but I'm sure I was subconsciously)?

It wouldn't be a bad thing, per se, but I've had four different friends tell me they thought I was mad at them because I don't text or call as much as I used to. It's true that I don't, but it has nothing to do with me being at all upset with them; it's just that I'm no longer sitting on my porch, looking for activities (texting, phone calls, games, etc.) to keep me engaged while I'm smoking. I'm doing other things instead. And when you factor in how time is now whizzing by for me, I'll often go a month or more without touching base with them, simply because I honestly don't realize that so much time has passed (not to mention that I don't really enjoy phone calls when I'm not smoking). I've explained this to them, but I don't think they understand. 

I guess that's the only downside to quitting, but I'm still so glad that I did.

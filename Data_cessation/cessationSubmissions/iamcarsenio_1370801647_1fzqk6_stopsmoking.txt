Today, I am making what is hopefully my last attempt at quitting smoking.

I quit drinking about 5 months ago and since then I've been smoking like a chimney. I, however, do not smoke because I get any enjoyment from it. I smoke to maintain and not be furious. Cutting back hasn't worked and I'm not smoking today. 

Any experience, strength and hope you all can offer me about this? 
Maybe a badge?

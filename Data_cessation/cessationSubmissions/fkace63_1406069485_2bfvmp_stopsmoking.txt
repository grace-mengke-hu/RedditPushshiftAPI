Nicotine not addicting hypothesis have any credence?

I have come across some research before that it's not nicotine that is incredibly addicting, but the combination of nicotine and and the MAOI's found in cigarettes. 

These are two articles which I have come across that seem to make this claim.

This article states "Nicotine is the major neuroactive compound of tobacco, which has, by itself, weak reinforcing properties."

This second source is a professor that hypothesizes nicotine does not cause cigarette addiction.

If this hypothesis is in fact correct, then perhaps using NRT, like patches could help alleviate withdrawal symptoms from the MAOI and nicotine combined, and then sheer "willpower" could alleviate the then withdrawal symptoms from nicotine after withdrawing from the non-nicotine addicting compounds in cigarettes. 

I was curious if anyone had any insights based on experiences quitting and/or your general understanding of the science.

Depersonalization on day 9? Has this happened to anyone?

I quit a bit back and started again (SO SO STUPID). I was ok until day 4 where I had diarrhea and my throat and lungs hurt. I tried exercising and my lungs burned. Then came the gas. Now I can exercise and the throat feels better but I slept 10 and a half hours last night and just don’t feel like myself. I don’t know if it is brain fog but my brain just isn’t working, I’m exhausted and everything has a dream like quality to it. Is this normal?

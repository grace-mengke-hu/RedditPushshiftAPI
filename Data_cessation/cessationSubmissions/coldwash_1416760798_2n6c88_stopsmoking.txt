Keep on stumbling.

I'm fucking soft, I'll admit that.  I get to about 30 days w/o a smoke and then boom one weak moment and I'm back on the fags.  The worst thing is that I feel like I am in complete control of my addiction before that moment arises... It just takes one lapse of concentration. One slip in willpower if you will, and all that hard work is laid to waste. 

Anyway, this sub helped a lot the fist time I quit; especially as that number on that little badge approached triple figures.  I feel like the higher that number gets, the greater the pain in dropping your your game.  So here we ago again.  Time to reset the badge and kick it for good. 

Thanks (this sub rocks).

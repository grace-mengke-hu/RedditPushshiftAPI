Weight issue since I quit.

So guys, I’ve been very careful about what I eat since I quit. I’m having healthy meals, snacks etc.. well I’m gaining weight. Sad part is that all my happiness and satisfaction about smoke withdrawal has been replaced by a sense of anxiety and anguish about the weight gain. Do you think that the lack of nicotine slow metabolism down? Do you think it’s temporary?

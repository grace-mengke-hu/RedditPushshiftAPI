did not relapse,proud of me.

I quit smoking Feb 8,2019. I have actively avoided stressful situations since then. Today I took my step daughter , her boy toy and her 4 children to the greyhound to move from az to Michigan ..they harped on one another the hour and a half while we waited for the bus to arrive. Yes I'm worried sick that they are going to abandon the 6 and 11 year old on their voyage. Will cross that bridge when we get there. But for today. Did not touch a cigarette or anything like it.Did chew a lot of gum.

I hope this is the right place to ask this. I was a smoker for 13yrs and gave up completely with the help of e-cigs for a few months. I fucked up last week and started smoking again for about 6 days, the last few days i've only have 1 or 2 per day.

I've just had (hopefully) my last one and I was wondering what the cravings will be like now if I stop? Will they be as bad as they were originally? Should I order some more e-liquid and wean myself off the easy way or will the withdrawls be manageable?

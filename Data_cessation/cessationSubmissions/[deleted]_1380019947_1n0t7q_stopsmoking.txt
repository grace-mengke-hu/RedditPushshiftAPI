Quitting and weight gain.

I've quit for three weeks now and I feel physically better than ever. After a 7 year habit of 10 a day I can take deep breathes again without spluttering or coughing. However I weighed 175lbs before and now I'm 184 in just three weeks! I never realised until I googled it that nicotine actually speeds up your metabolism, I always thought it was just an appetite suppressant. 

So did anyone else have considerable weight gain, and what have been your tips for combating it?

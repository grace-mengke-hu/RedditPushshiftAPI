Here we go

After 10 years of smoking, I am truly ready to be done with it. I hate the smell, the taste and the control cigarettes take. Not to mention the cost. Here is Australia, a 20 pack costs around $17-18.

In a sense, its like saying goodbye to an old friend who is always there. So goodbye old friend, lets hope we never meet again.

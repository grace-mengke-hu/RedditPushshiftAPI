Need assistance! Read Allen Carr but..

First let me say that the book changed my perspective COMPLETELY. I'm at the point now where I am focused in when I'm smoking, and I hate it. I hate the smell, the taste, everything. However, I still haven't stopped. I do find myself going longer without cigarettes when I'm outside, and I don't even realise it. 

Inside my home however, it's every hour- sometimes half. I feel I'm so close to a breakthrough, but there's just a little fear of losing my "security blanket" that's holding me back. 

Has anyone else coped with this?

Edit: Also, I live with my boyfriend who has been smoking for 12 years and does NOT want to quit. He smokes inside as well. (This is his home, and I will not ask him to go outside to smoke. Especially since he chain smokes.)

Food Tastes Worse?

Hey everyone,

I've been smoke- free for about 3 months now. Everything is going much better than expected, except for one glaring issue: I hate eating now.

Absolutely nothing tastes good. At best, things taste dull and flat; at worst, things are outright disgusting. I used to be a huge foodie and enjoyed cooking and exploring different restaurants. Now, I no longer get any enjoyment from eating. I had hoped that this would eventually go away, but it has still persisted 3 months in. I was under the impression that quitting led to a more enjoyable eating experience...

Has anyone else dealt with this? If so, did it get better? Thoughts in general?

Thanks!

Just stopped smoking

Hi im new here.  Quitting after 12 years (30 n smokin since 18)  Guess i just wanna get my story off my chest. 

 I noticed blood in my spit like 8 months ago so i saw my doctor n he said try not drinking so i did cuz i thought it was only on mornings after i drank.  6 months later i noticed its just all the time i just have to spit a few times for it to show.  So i passed out the other day n i went to the hospital n doc there says quit smoking n get checked up again with doc n dentist.

So i tried quitting fathers day n made it 1 and a half rageful days.  Tonite instead of getting a pack when i ran out i decided to just say f it.  

All 3 of my roomates smoke so its gonna be hard but its not even like i want to quit anymore, i need to.

Anyways, im glad i found this community i hope i get along here.

Thanks

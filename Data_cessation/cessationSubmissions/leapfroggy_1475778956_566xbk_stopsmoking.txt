About 7 months in, and I did some math...

In addition to the 7 months of quit time currently under my belt (longest quit ever, and hopefully for good), I quit once for 4 months, once for 2, another time for 2, and have about a month's worth of odd weeks here and there. So, if I add in those 9 months, that equals 16 months of no smoking out of the last 4 years. 

I never gave myself credit for those times and it feels good to know that even though I had to reset my count to zero a few times, my body still benefited.

To those struggling today, don't give up! Or if you just happened to give in today, don't beat yourself up too bad... the days do add up eventually.

Camping Success!

I just returned from a camping trip where I could have smoked and I wasn't tempted too.  Well, I wasn't *very* tempted anyway.  I'm really happy I enjoyed a smoke free weekend in the woods.  And 5 months of not smoking is just around the corner, so I'm glad I didn't screw that up.

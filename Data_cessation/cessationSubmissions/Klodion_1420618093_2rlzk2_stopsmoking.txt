Time for the tough part - Day 7.

Hi guys.

I have been reluctant to make a post over my first week, as I've felt like there's nothing much to report. I have however had incredibly bad insomnia for the past 5 days, it has got to a point where I lay in bed for 3 or more hours before I even fall asleep, and last night I gave up trying to sleep all-together, so I'm heading into my first day back at college after an all night Two And A Half Men marathon.

As I am back in college, I will most likely to be tempted to smoke a cigarette, but I'm certain that I won't do so. I have been holding on to my left over tobacco from New Year for the past week to give to a smoker friend, as I didn't want to throw away Â£8. Despite this tobacco being sat in my desk drawer all week, I have not touched it once, so I'm feeling positive about my quitting progress.

That's all I've really got to say, if anyone has any advice about this insomnia I'd be super grateful, other than that good luck everyone today, and congratulations to all of the New Year quitters like myself who just hit 7 days!

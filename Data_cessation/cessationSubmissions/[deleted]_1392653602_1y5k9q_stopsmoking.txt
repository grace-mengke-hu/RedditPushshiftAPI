It's been four days...

So I called it quits on Thursday 13/02/2014, I've basically smoked my last pack and left one cigarette in it, and i'm carrying it with me where ever i go. My goal is to keep this cigarette untouched for at least a month, and the reason why i keep it with me is to test my will power and see how far i can go without touching it. Every time i feel like smoking and i get the urges where it seems like the only thing that can make me feel better is by smoking that fag, i just take out the pack and wiggle it around to remotivate and remind myself that it's still there and i hadn't given up yet. 

This technique seems to be working so far, but it's incredibly difficult, my mood has gotten worse and worse, everything seems to annoy me, and i mean EVERYTHING, i have been incredibly unproductive today at work because all i'm thinking about is smoking that fag, and I almost snapped on one of my colleagues for no reason what so ever. this is the first time i have gone more than 2 hours without a cigarette since I started smoking (3 years ago).

let's see how far i can make it before i pick up that pack and wiggle it around without feeling the cigarette inside it.

I'm not smoking today

Simple as that. I have been to several parties, gatherings and in quite a few situations where I have had the opportunity to smoke and when I think about how many days I've put in, then I tell myself... Nah, I'm not smoking today. Even if you have to convince yourself, okay, I'll save a real cigarette for tomorrow. And then by the time tomorrow rolls around, you will have forgotten the whole thing (because you were drunk when you were craving in the first place) or you realize how silly you were to think that would have made the evening so much better.

So just keep telling yourself; I'm not smoking today.

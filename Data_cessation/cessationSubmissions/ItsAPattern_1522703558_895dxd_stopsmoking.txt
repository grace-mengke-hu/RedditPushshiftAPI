Here we go again. 13 hours in and feeling ok so far.

Definitely have been talking about this for about a year of these 2.5 years I've been back on the habit. I enjoyed 5 years off the brown weed before then, based on Easy Way. 
I read Easy Way again one other time in the last year or so, and I just felt that it wasn't going to stick. It did not.
So recently, as I know this habit is horrible and unsustainable, I got the audio on audible and just finished last night. I felt a bit of the same resonating inside that I remembered from my last successful quit, and I'm happy to be a non-smoker today. Ready to watch the little demon leave my body over following days and weeks and lean on my many communities and  passions in times of difficulty!

Thanks for being here, quitters!

Anyone else experience this?

I am 30 days quit tomorrow and lately I don't find myself craving an actual cigarette so much as I crave that feeling of comfort I got from having a routine/habit. I am getting such extreme cases of anxiety where I get overly emotional and feel really isolated/disconnected. The emotional stress is really getting to me. I don't even want a cigarette. I just want these emotions to go away. Anyone else deal with something like this? Any suggestions on how to cope and get through? Anything is welcome at this point.

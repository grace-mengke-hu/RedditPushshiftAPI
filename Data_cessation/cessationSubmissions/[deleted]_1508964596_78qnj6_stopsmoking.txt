Ok. I did two days...now what? ðŸ˜ƒðŸ™Š Iâ€™m going crazy, thoughts like Â« you know you eventually gonna smoke Â», Â« itâ€™s not that bad Â« , Â»it relaxes you Â», Â»remember how nice those moments were Â», Â»just take a drink and light one up Â»... I need help. Maybe I donâ€™t want to quit that much... any advice ?

Need Advice in Helping a Best Friend Quit

Hey guys, so I met my one of my best friends in college about a couple years ago, and at the time, he would occasionally take small, short smoke breaks every now and then. After a while, I noticed that he would smoke 2-3 cigarettes more than he'd usually would when we'd hang out. Today, I've noticed he would smoke any chance that he'd get. e.g. smoking after eating, driving and smoking, hanging out with friends and smoking, frequent smoke breaks, etc. Just yesterday, I saw that his car had packs of cigarettes laying almost everywhere in his car.

In August, he quit cold turkey and ended up getting a vape pen, which made me really happy to see because he seemed like a much happier person. But then once school started to pick up, he got back into it. I figured it was because classes got stressful, but it also doesn't help that his brother and his other friends are also frequent smoker themselves.

In the past, I've told him to slow down on it, and if he'd ever consider quitting completely, but each time he would just nod and agree and tell me that he's planning on it, but then change the subject shortly afterwards. Recently, I tried to make a pact with him so we'd both quit smoking together, but he shot down that idea because he didn't think he could do it with me.

Anyways, I'm hoping if anyone could give me any advice to help him quit. I understand that it's completely up to him to stop smoking, but I'm not sure what's the best way I can approach this without him disregarding my advice to stop. 

Thanks in advance, everyone.

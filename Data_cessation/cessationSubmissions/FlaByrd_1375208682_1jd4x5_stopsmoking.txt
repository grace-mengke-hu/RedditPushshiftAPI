Day two on the patch!

forgive my vent - 
Im irritable and anxious I know i want to quit but I also know how easy it would be to go grab a co-workers ciggs and smoke one.  BUT i am not im stronger than that.  

How can I be both bored and anxious at the same time?

I had a weak moment last night.  My official quit date and time was 11pm 7/28 I made it until after dinner last night and had a mini meltdown.  I was anxious and sweaty and ITCHY?  Itchy! I wasnt expecting Itchy.  I broke.  I went outside and had a cigg with the patch on and it wasnt the free flowing satisfaction I thought it would be there was no rush of enjoyment I in fact did not enjoy it and got dizzy and felt ill (bcuz of the patch) 

thats it had to vent I work in a garage and everyone smoking around me smells so good but Im holding fast today.

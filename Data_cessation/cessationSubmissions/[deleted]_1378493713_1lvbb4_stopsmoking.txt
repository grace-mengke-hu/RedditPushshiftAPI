40 hours in, looking for some advice.

Hey everyone, 

First off, I want to thank you all for such a great community. It has certainly been a tremendous help. 

I had my last cigarette on Wednesday night. Like all of you, I have my reasons for quitting. This post is to ask for some advice. Again, I'm about a day a half in and I'm doing alright. Pretty well, actually. The occasional attack, but nothing intolerable yet. However, I find myself trying to justify a smoke. I know the nicotine in my brain is out to get me right now, but I'll continue. Here's why:

I will be attending an event a week from today that I have been looking forward to for about 7 months. I will be hosting several friends next weekend because of said event. At that point, I plan on being 8 days clean, but I'm worried. I'm worried that I won't be myself, that ill be irritable, anxious, down, or otherwise distant because of the withdrawals. I have made the decision that I will quit, but I don't want the (understandable) withdrawal period to negatively affect this time that I've been looking forward to for so long. I know I can do this, I just want to know if its advisable to wait until after this (exciting & stressful, with a lot of drinking) event to start. 

On the flip side, there will be a girl there that I'm interested in that I can't imagine has any tolerance for smoking. 


Thoughts?

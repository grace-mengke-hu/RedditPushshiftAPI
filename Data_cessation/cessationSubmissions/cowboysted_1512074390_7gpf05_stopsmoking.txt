Today is my 30 day mark. It couldn't be going better.

I 'treated' myself to a fag on my birthday but after two draws I found it so disgusting I had to throw it away. Now I'm in the situation where I still have cravings but know that having a cigarette is no longer enjoyable. I'm quite lucky, it has made this so easy. Also, instead of putting on a few kg I lost 3kg.

Also, does anyone else feel the need to compulsively inhale very deeply. It feels like the need to yawn but instead I just want to take a really big, deep breath. It's nice. Quitting is amazing!

I am trying to quit smoking

Hello /r/stopsmoking

I'm 24 years old and I've been smoking for the last 3 and a half years. I've come to realize that smoking is a filthy and disgusting habit and decided to quit, but I need some advice.

I smoke about 15 cigarettes a day, about once every hour. That number might go up when I'm with friends in a social situation, especially if I drink alcohol.

I tried quitting cold turkey, but the withdrawal symptoms include a terrible headache and I can't really concentrate and work productively (I'm a system administrator). I've decided to give myself an allowance of 4 cigarettes a day and try to taper off the nicotine addiction. I'll try to reduce that number over the course of a few weeks.

So, my question is, in your opinion, is this going to be effective or should I try to quit cold turkey?

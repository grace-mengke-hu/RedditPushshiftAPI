Chantix: Day 3

Moving slowly along, today is the final day of .5mg tolerance building dosage. Tomorrow it will be .5mg twice daily, Friday starts 1mg twice daily. Saturday is my planned quit date but I am going to be organic with it depending on how the Chantix is working for me.

I've read extensively about Chantix, especially the side effects prior to having my Dr prescribe it. Because I am not predisposed to the worst side effects, I decided the benefits outweighed the risks. My insurance paid full cost so that's a bonus.

I like the way Chantix works. It binds to the neurorecepters that nicotine binds to effectively blocking the nicotine. I plan to run the full three month course to let the drug do it's work. The only alteration will be during the final week I am going to taper out the same way I tapered in.

I've got my list of reasons, the Chantix, and a strong determination to get through the quit and make the necessary life changes to stay quit. I'm feeling positive about this.

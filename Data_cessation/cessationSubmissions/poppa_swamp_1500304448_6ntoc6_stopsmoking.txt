For me it's not cigarettes, it's the habit and nicotine

I'm soon to be graduating with a degree in Computer Science. I had quit nicotine for just over a month last summer. My mind felt a lot calmer and it was nice but I still wasn't as sharp for technical tasks and once school rolled around I went back to vaping. I keep telling myself that nicotine is my extra boost I need to code and get my breaks to go think about the problem and stimulate back up. So I always say fuck it, this is my vice I get - I quit smoking weed and drinking as much anyways, I'm doing good.

I think now is a great time for me to quit seeing as I don't have a real job yet (just internship) and I could hopefully be back to a sharp mind by the time graduation comes. Yet I'm reluctant, I'm worried I'll throw myself off my game. Idk guys, it's like I want to do this at times but then also I have something in the back of my mind saying don't be ridiculous - we're doing just fine and good where we're at. Pretty torn.

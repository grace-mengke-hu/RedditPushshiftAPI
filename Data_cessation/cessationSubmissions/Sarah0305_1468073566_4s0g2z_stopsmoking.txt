4 days smoke free - what part of the day do you find you have your strongest cravings?

I have quit smoking for just over 4 days. I had made the decision to vape and I am currently using 12mg E-juices. I have found that I still have the cravings for cigarettes but already have noticed that I am craving them less and less. My strongest cravings seems to be first thing in the morning and in the evenings. Does anybody else find that these are prime times for craving a cigarette?

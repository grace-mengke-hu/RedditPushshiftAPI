Just realized I haven't thought about smoking

3 whole days it hasn't crossed my mind a single time until I was watching a documentary on heroin addiction and remembered I was addicted to nicotine.

There will always be that little rebel voice that entertains the idea when I think that this is a forever thing, but I know that's more to do with human instinct to avoid restriction rather than wanting a cigarette (I forgot what cravings feel like).

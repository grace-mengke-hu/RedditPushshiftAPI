Ok, 1st big accomplishment...the "first-thing-in-the-morning" cigarette.

I can't believe I did this! It feels so good to be able to smell my lovely perfume and not have bad breath due to cigarettes!

I do feel a little fuzzy, not as focused as normal...but I can deal with it, MINOR headache. I  never associated caffeine as a trigger so I'm having a small cup of coffee and 2 Tylenol. It's helped a lot.

Also, found out last night when I was having an intense, I literally cried, moment that the small [sugar daddy's](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mghzzmIJf0U/SSSG--1lpiI/AAAAAAAAAJA/PytkuDwpJsk/s400/sugar_daddy.jpg) REALLY did the trick for the oral fixation of smoking...

Hard day today.

Today is a hard day, I’m on the patch and it’s been a tough day. I woke up feeling ok but I feel like my bp is up and I’m feeling antsy as hell. I’ve been through this many times but don’t remember feeling this weird. I’m going to keep the patch on since I’m at work and think it could be my anxiety and I’m over reacting. But I’m going to monitor how I feel and will take off the patch if necessary. Just venting but would like to know if any other patch wearers ever felt this way in the beginning. I’m usually don’t feel this way on the patch. One more thing it could be because I quit drinking on the same day too. I just remembered that. Hmmmmmm. Tomorrow morning will be 3.5 days. Hopefully will start feeling better by then. Thank you fiends.

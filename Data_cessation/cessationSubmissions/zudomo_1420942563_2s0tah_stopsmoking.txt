God I wish I still smoked.

I've been drunk and hammered several times before and I was fine. But today I'm drinking and things are stressful
 I'm not having a craving just a thought of how good it will be if I still smoked. I'm not going to smoke. I know that. But i need to post this

Edit: just visiting the sub and posting helps me. I love the support here.  And I'll update tomorrow letting you know that I may make bad decisions tonight but one of them won't be smoking lol

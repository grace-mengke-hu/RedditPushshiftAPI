15 year old cat died and I didn't smoke

We had Buddy since about three weeks after we got together and that was 15 years ago. Buddy has always been around, he's never not been here, until Monday. He was showing us signs that his time was here and we couldn't let him suffer. I thought about smoking, but that wouldn't give us any more time with him. I feel that this quit will stick, if losing my Buddy didn't make me smoke, this might be the last time I quit.

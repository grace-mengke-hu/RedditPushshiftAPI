Partner didn't notice one month plus.

My partner asked me yesterday if I wanted any vaping supplies.  I looked at him sort of dumbfounded and explained that I quit smoking and vaping over a month ago.  I was a little hurt that he hadn't noticed.  And I'm sure I told him at least once that I had quit.

Oh well.  I am happy to be an ex-smoker.  I went into a leather store yesterday and they had beautiful handmade leather lighter covers.  I just looked at them and admired the craftsmanship and thought, "I have no need for this."  It was pretty cool.  I don't carry a lighter anymore.  They also had lovely messenger bags.  With all the money I save from not smoking, I'll be able to get one of those bags someday.

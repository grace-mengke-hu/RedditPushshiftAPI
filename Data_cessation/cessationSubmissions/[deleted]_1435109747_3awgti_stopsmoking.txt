How long do ex-smoker symptoms last?

Not cravings necessarily, but things like coughing, phlegm, irritability, etc. 

Any info on how much you smoked prior to quitting would be helpful too. 

I was a "casual" smoker (1-3 per day), and I don't cough much but I feel like my throat is a bit clogged more often than I'd like. Could be the smog :X

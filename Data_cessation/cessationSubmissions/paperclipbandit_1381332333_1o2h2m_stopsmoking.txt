It's been a while since I've been here, but I wanted to drop by and say, Keep going. You can do it.

I can't believe I quit, still to this day. I have to say, the e-cig worked for me, and I couldn't have done it without it. I had some negative feedback from this sub  from people saying I hadn't really quit, b/c I was still getting nicotine. But guess what? I kept using the e-cig for about two-three weeks, until I finally said, you know what? This is stupid. And I was done. The cravings where minimal at that point, and I haven't looked back. Don't give up. Do what works for YOU, and screw the naysayers. You can do it.

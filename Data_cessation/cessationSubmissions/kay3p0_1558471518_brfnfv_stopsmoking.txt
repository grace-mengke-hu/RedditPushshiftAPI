On day 4. When did y’all stop waking up with sore throats?

I’m 3 days and 12 hours smoke free. According to the Smoke Free app my breathing is back to normal and in 4 months coughing and wheezing will be gone.

I smoked for 8 years and never really had a smokers cough. Obviously I know cigarettes fuck up your lungs’ ability to push unwanted stuff out, so when you quit your body starts doing it’s job again.

No science lessons, lectures, or unsolicited advice please. Just want to know when those symptoms went away for some people. 

Thanks!

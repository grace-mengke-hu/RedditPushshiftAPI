12 Days, 17 Hours and 57 Minutes, give or take

That's how long I've gone without smoking. My quit smoking app wanted me to check out a few posts on Reddit today of people who quit, and said extra points if I posted something. So here's my post. 

I never actually quit smoking, I just haven't smoked in that long. I can't quit smoking, that task is way too daunting and way too overwhelming for me. Thinking about it, I imagine myself on a couch in a dimly lit room, feeling torturous pain while pulling my straggly hair out and scratching at my clothes and skin, and getting scrawny as the months on the calendar get ripped off. How is anybody supposed to succeed with that thought? It makes it super stressful and makes me want to smoke even more! Why would I do that to myself? Why wouldn't I want to work with myself?

So now I understand the saying "one day at a time." I didn't quit, I'm just not going to entertain my next craving. It'll come, and it'll be uncomfortable. But whatever, because it'll also leave. And eventually, it will quit.

I only have cravings after stressful events now. I used to have habitual cravings whenever I drove or right before I went to sleep, but after a day or two I learned the craving would pass and just started ignoring it. I never actually had the "oh my God, I quit smoking! Shit!" stress cravings.

And I also didn't research how to not smoke. Too many triggering pictures.

My journey's been so much easier than I thought. But then again, I never actually quit.

Having a hard time.

Okay, so I have stopped and started smoking I don't know how many times and I think I am done now but I have so much self-doubt. I read Alan Carr's The Easy Way. I finished the book, quit for exactly 1 week and then started again. What the hell is wrong with me? I hate smoking and I know that there is absolutely no benefit to it, so why do I continue to fail over and over again? 
I am hoping I just smoked my last one for the 100th time and any words of wisdom/encouragement would be wonderful.

Can't stop tapping my feet

Hello, I am new here. Just randomly decided to stop 2 days ago and found my way to this sub. I'm just wondering if this is a common withdrawal symptom? I'm constantly having this urge to tap/move my feet, it's very bizarre. Sleep is incredibly difficult because of it. I also feel kind of achey and just basically feel like shit. Hopefully this all goes away soon

My Mission today (day26)... I like this!

Hi all, I've been doing my day 26 mission all day today from my 'smoke free' app ... And I really like it... I want to share with you... Please give it a try. :). If you wear a watch, switch wrists. If u don't wear a watch, pick out and wear a fresh piece of jewelry that u don't normally wear.  ... A ring... A necklace... A bracelette ... A nipple-ring (just kidding) Whatever.  Every time u feel it or see it... Say to yourself "I don't smoke". And feel all **proud of yourself** while you're saying it.  :). I like it! Happy face!  I'm doing it tomorrow too. :). LMK.

Dreams about smoking

Last night I had a dream about smoking, it's not the first and I'm betting it won't be the last. I woke up from the dream feeling like utter shit, fully believed I had caved to the addiction, and what was worse is that in my dream I didn't care. I felt like I'd earned that smoke, I'd earned my pat on the back for doing so well.

Well, I couldn't get back to sleep for a while, so it got me to thinking why I felt so bad from a silly dream, and I think I found the answer. I think the guilt and shame I felt after the dream is a powerful reminder of how I would feel if I smoked again IRL. In dreams, I can just wake up, gather my thoughts, then rest assured that all is well, but if I'd have smoked for real, these feelings would have a massive impact on the way I view my self.

Sorry for the waffle, as usual I just post things here. Helps to keep myself in check. I hope you all are having an easy day :)

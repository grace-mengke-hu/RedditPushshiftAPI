Any of you heard of snus? It's even worse than cigarettes.

So snus is basically tobacco that you put under your lip, and while I have managed to quit smoking, I have never managed to quit snus.

It's available in at least Norway and Sweden, and what makes it so hard to quit, that I'm aware of at least, is that it lacks most of the downsides with tobacco.

*You can do it anywhere 
*It doesn't make your lungs fucked
*You don't feel tired/like shit as you do with cigarettes
*It got very few, to none documented health effects, unlike tobacco 

Basically with out all of these negative effects, it's so much easier to start again, it feels good the first time for a long while, unlike a cigarette, and you got the same exact urge to take one if you are trying to quit.

Any advice people?

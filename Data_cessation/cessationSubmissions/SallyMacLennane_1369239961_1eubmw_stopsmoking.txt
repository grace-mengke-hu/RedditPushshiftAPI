Chantix related AMA over in r/AMA!

Hi, Everyone! I'm doing an AMA which I probably should have just done here, but I didn't know this sub existed till after I posted in AMA. I quit smoking 5 years ago with the help of chantix. There's a lot of discussion of the negative side effects and low to moderate success rate, but not much about the positive side. I want to offer my experience and thoughts with anyone who is curious.

So, If you want to check it out, it's [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/1euama/i_quit_smoking_cigarettes_5_years_ago_today_using/).

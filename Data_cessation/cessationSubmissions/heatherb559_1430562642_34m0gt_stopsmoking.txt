Freedom Bitches!!!!

63 days without smoking and 18 days without nicotine!  I'm not sure if there are words to describe the sense of freedom I feel. I have literally been a slave to nicotine for over 20 years. I tried to quit so many times I've lost count. I spent a good decade either on, off, or climbing back on the wagon. Looking back I see a vision of myself that is something like Snoopy's pigpen except I'm enveloped in a cloud of smoke everywhere I go. I'm so glad I found the courage to say NO MORE! My life has changed dramatically since I quit. I decided I'd be saying no more about a few things. I got a new job that I start in a month. If I smoked, I never would have been hired. Its a dream job for me. I started training for a 5k this week. I've never run for fun in my life. I was out of breath and tired when it was over but only because I'm out of shape. My lungs didn't hurt at all. Today I'm getting out on the river and I'm not worried about triple ziplock bagging my smokes. 
I still get withdrawal pangs... I wouldn't call them cravings. The little junky living in my head cries for a fix on occasion but there is no urgency in that feeling anymore. I am finally free of the prison of addiction and fear and suffering I locked myself into for so many years. I'm proud to be here with all y'all today..... Nicotine Free!

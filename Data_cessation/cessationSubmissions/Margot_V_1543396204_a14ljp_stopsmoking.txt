Stop smoking - online shopping

I stopped smoking last week - I am on day 5. I ready "easyway" and that was it. I am not using patches or any NRT.

Suddenly I am getting all these parcels at work and I went to check my bank account and I realized how much money I have spent online shopping since. I was aware that I was buying stuff; but not as much. It's as if I only have willpower to do one thing at the time...

Has this ever happened to anyone?

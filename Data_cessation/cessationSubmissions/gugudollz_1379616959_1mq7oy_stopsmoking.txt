First 24 hours in a long time. Craving episodes pass people.

I usually smoke at school, away from my parents, but lately I had become so addicted that I would 'sneak' the occasional cig at home. Sneak in quotes since I wasn't fooling anyone.

Anyway, today I beat a nic-fit for the first time in a long time. My message to you is that they pass. They only last a few minutes. 5 tortuous minutes but five only. Call on a non-smoker friend, hell, make your challenge finding something to distract yourself with until the episode passes and you'll be fine.

holy smokes

it's been a while since i've been here. i quit smoking cigarettes at the beginning of the year as part of a new years resolution which i have kept my promise! i made the switch to electronic cigarettes and instead and have been using that throughout the year. however, i want to quit the nicotine altogether this year. i still feel pretty addicted but i believe it will be easier if i have the right intent and determination i had the same time last year. since i requested my badge, I've been going to the gym, running, and I even completed my first 5K ever which I am very proud of!! just sharing my success story thus far and encourage anyone having difficulty quitting to pm me or leave a comment :)

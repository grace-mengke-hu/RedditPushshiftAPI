90-day milestone: First business trip ever without smoking

Work trips are stressful, sure. The hours are long, the airports are hectic and the planes are cramped. It was an absolute guarantee that I'd be blazing outside the terminal asap. For the first time since probably 1997: straight to Hertz, hotel, etc. absolutely without nicotine. Happy as a mofo. I owe it to the encouragement here and that little day counter.

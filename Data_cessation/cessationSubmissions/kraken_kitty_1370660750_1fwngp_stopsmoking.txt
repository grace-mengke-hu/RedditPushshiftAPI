I just quit this morning at 12:00am

I had my last cigarette at midnight, right before I went to sleep.  I woke up this morning with new resolve, an emergency box of NicoDerm Step 2 patches, and a fully charged e-cigarette (Canadian-style, no nicotine).



Is there anything I should be careful of, like sudden cravings and urges?  What should I do in case something like that happens?  I've got a great support network, but I'm still very anxious about slipping up like I have twice before :(  I really need this to work!  I know I can do it, I need to, I can BE STRONG!



 . . . I guess I just need a little help, is all . . .

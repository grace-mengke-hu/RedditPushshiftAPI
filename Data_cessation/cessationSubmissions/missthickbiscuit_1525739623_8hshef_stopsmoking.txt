My quit date is May 20th. Any advice on preparing myself?

I’ve smoked for 15 years. Hardcore. Like the last few years has been upwards of two packs a day. I’m very ashamed of my smoking habit. I hate smelling like smoke. I hate constantly having to clear my throat and coughing like I’m dying in the mornings. I HATE the expense of it. What a waste. I hate not being able to exercise like I want to. My lungs quit long before my muscles do. But I’ve hated all of these things for years, and have still failed at every attempt I’ve made to quit. Failing so many times is very discouraging to me. Like this time might turn out the same as all the other times I’ve tried. I’ve tried gum, vapes, cold turkey and hypnotherapy so far. This time I’m trying the patches and re-reading my Allen Carr book. But I’d also like to ask the ex-smokers here for advice on what you did to mentally prepare yourself for the change? Anything in particular that you think helped lead to your success in quitting? I’ve already gotten so much good advice and encouragement from this forum. Thanks for the help I’ve received so far and any more is greatly appreciated.

I'm being selfish

I've smoked on and off (mostly on) since I was 16. I've quit a few times - ranging from a month to 2 years without smoking but I always wind up back with a cigarette in my hand.

The extent of my smoking hit me like a tonne of bricks last week. I was out of breath and my chest was tight walking up the stairs. I'm 23, I used to be able to run 5km in under 22 minutes - now a set of stairs has left me gasping. I couldn't keep it up.

So I decided to change it. I needed to quit. I've always heard people say they quit for their kids, for their family, for their SO - I'm quitting for me.

I have an amazing girlfriend, I told her I knew we'd be married and have kids. But I didn't know that, I knew I wanted it to happen but I couldn't know that it would. Simply because I knew that my smoking wouldn't give me a long life to live.

I'm not quitting for her, or our potential children - I'm quitting for me. I want her to have me around for a long time, I want our kids to have a happy healthy dad - but what I want more than anything is to enjoy my time with her and them. 

I'm not quitting because "I couldn't imagine putting her or the kids through that" I'm quitting because "I want to have a lot of healthy, fun filled years with my girl and our family". Death is certain, the time is not. I could still be taken in 15 years from something unrelated to my smoking, but if I keep smoking i won't enjoy those years.

It's only been 2 days, and they have been a tough 2 days but I will keep going. Each day it gets easier.

Day one

20 year smoker here. Stopped today. Am vaping as I thought this would mitigate withdrawal completely.
Totally hasn't, just want to punch someone & cry.

I smoke weed in my downtime, usually with tobacco, but have bought a pipe for this evening.
Great sub, helped a lot reading through today.
2 & half hours until I can leave work & commute without a smoke. Dreading it.

Thanks for listening.

43 Days!

I planned my username several years ago for this exact day.  (no, no I didn't)

I've gotten this far by keeping a couple cheap ecigs on my person at all times.  I suggest it to those having trouble with the habitual part of quitting.  I like the cheap ones because I don't want to enjoy it and become a hardcore vaper spending more on equipment than I would cigarettes anyway.  I just want to know that there is zero reason to get that chest-quickening feeling of needing a cigarette.  If I absolutely must make smoke with my mouth, I can do that.  If I feel like I have to have nicotine, I can get a little shot of it and go on.  

I chewed on these things constantly the first few days.  It does NOT feel the same as a cigarette, but that's what I have.  I went so far as to not carry any form of money to work.  I commute 3+ hours a day and pass a LOT of stores.  The first week or so, I still had the same triggers while driving or throughout my work day, but I just hit the ecig a couple times and went on.  A few days ago I drove all the way home and forgot to take the ecig out of my pocket.  I haven't bought refills for the ecigs in over a week, but I keep two of them charged in their plastic little case.  

For me, the psychology of knowing that this is all I have that I can smoke has really helped.  I no longer crave cigarettes except for increasingly rare occasions and on those occasions, I grab that little plastic case, grab an ecig, take a drag, and put it back.  Those occasions have gone from probably 100 a day to maybe 3 or 4.  

This might not be for everyone, but it has worked for me and I wanted to share it.

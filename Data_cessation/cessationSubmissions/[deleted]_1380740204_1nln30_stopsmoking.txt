Day 5.. Need Advice

I'll first off say I was never THAT heavy of a smoker. But for around a year I used nicotine in a weekly, then daily basis. I've had some weed to help cope with the withdrawls but today is my first day w/o, and I feel alot better then yesterday. Am I past the worst? Also, how can I deal with the depression w/o medication, and the disability to focus? I have alot of school work to get done and it's insanely difficult to get done.

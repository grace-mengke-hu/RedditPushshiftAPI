Failed

Failed again and now I feel like shit, have to reset my flair.

I don't get why I fail I mean, I'm pretty ok right now even though I'm a VERY anxious person. I know I prefer to get a few pounds but stop smoking, however, I act the opposite way. 

I wanna stop not only because I wanna improve my life quality but also because every time I smoke I feel really bad about myself, I can feel that I'm killing myself and get lots of guilt and see the world all black around me, like I can not enjoy life having this disgusting habit. I'm an hypochondriac, so you may think quitting should be a must for me... it is, but idk what I'm doing wrong or what needs to change in my mind to achieve it.

Sorry for the long, depressing post, maybe some of you went through the same and can say something that would help, idk.

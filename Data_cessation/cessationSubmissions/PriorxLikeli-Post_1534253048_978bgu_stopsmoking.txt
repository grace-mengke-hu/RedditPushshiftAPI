In need of support/tips

So I quit smoking 13 days ago and it has been going pretty good. Of course I have cravings every now and then, but I've been able to get past them without really considering to smoke again. Unfortunately, since a few days, the depressed mood has set in. Instead of a craving every now and then, I feel sad and down most of the day and I cannot seem to motivate myself to do anything. It takes a lot of effort to get out of bed in the morning and it's almost impossible to focus on work. During my last attempt, I started smoking again after 2 months exactly because I was feeling so down all the time. Despite knowing this would happen again and despite knowing that this is just my brain trying to get off the addiction, I notice that I am starting to talk myself into smoking again and my willpower is slowly decreasing. At this point, I still do not want to smoke, but I'm scared that I will give up eventually if I continue to feel like this. So I guess I am just wondering if anyone else went through this and has some tips?

Had a good day! But I'm a complete bitch :( Need a way to cope so no one dies.

I did not smoke today.  I could have, but I didn't.  I was tempted, but I read my book instead.  The problem is, I am a complete bitch.  I work in customer service and I deal with a lot of tough people, and I am going all Highlander on them.   Anything I can do?

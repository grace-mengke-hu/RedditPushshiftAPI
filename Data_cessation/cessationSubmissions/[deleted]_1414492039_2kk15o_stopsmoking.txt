Just stopped - how do I remain a non-smoker?

First of all - I know this are kind of posts you see every day, people had just quit and come here to share. I know I'm not the first nor the last. But I would like you to help me.   
  
I've been smoking for 12 years. Reading all the stuff on this subreddit, all of your own stories, really gives me strenght to stop. So does Allen Carr's method. And I did, just now. After numerous times of trying to quit. I've come to realize that I only "enjoy" one cigarette, first in the morning. So, I'm against that one or really against the one that got me hooked, that first filthy and disgusting one that I barely managed to hold down. I will do my best this time to succeed.  
  
But, here's my problem, main reason I always fail - I'm surrounded by smokers. My parents, girlfriend, friends. I can't just shut them out of my life for several days or weeks. Even tonight I'll see my girlfriend and she'll be smoking. My parents will come by and they will be smoking. **How did you get over being surrounded by smokers? What gave you the strenght to continue on your way of non-smoking?**

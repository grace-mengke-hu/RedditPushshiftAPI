trickery

I've only just started quitting. I've downloaded smokefree and my official quit day is the 15th. but knowing that I'm quitting my brain is playing tricks on me. anytime i have to go out during work (a few times a day) my brain tells me "lets have a smoke while were out, it'll be fun and sneaky, hurry before someone sees!!" almost making a fun hide and seek game out it. like, hey! smoking is fun when its a game... I've been able to shut it down but then i'll be driving and half way through a smoke i'll notice what I've done. 
fingers crossed i get this under control.

So much reset :(

This is my 4th time resetting my badge and I hope it's the last time. I get a few days and even a week once but my magic number seems to be 8. After 8 days is when I start to feel it the most. The Allan Carr book says that if you can make 3 weeks that is a milestone but that seems like 3 years to me right now. 

I just have to remember that Cigarettes give me absolutely nothing, they are an expensive, disgusting habit that will kill me and I have to check with all of you every day, every hour it seem until I can crest the hump of the 3 weeks. 

I want to beat this sooooooo bad and i know, if I stick around here long enough and keep myself accountable, I'm gonna make it. 

Good evening . . . .

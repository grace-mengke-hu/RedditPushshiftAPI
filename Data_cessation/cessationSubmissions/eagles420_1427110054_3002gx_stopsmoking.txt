It is time..

Decided to finally quit yesterday. Been thinking about it for a while now. I have my son on the way, he is due on June 30th. Did not want to be smoking then worrying about having to wash my hands before I went to hold him. So Saturday night I was at a friends house having some drinks. A couple turned into a bunch, and of course a bunch of smokes along with that. Woke up yesterday morning feeling like absolute shit. So i've made it over 24 hours now and I dont feel that bad. Have a pack with 3 in them not sure why I'm carrying them around but I cant bring myself to throw them away. Sigh..hope this gets easier,

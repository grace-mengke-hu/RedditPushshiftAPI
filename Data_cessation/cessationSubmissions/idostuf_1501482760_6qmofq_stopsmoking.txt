Looks like I almost didn't notice passing 200 days

Just made this post to say that this is pretty much the only thing I've succeeded at this entire year. This might sound a bit cliche-d but if I can do it, so can you. My cravings are 99.99% gone.. I sleep much better. I am still getting used to my new found lung capacity. It feels like my brain stops half way because it thinks my lungs will hurt if I inhale any more. But I definitely have a lot more room in my lungs. So I am doing breathing exercises to retrain my brain I guess. My libido has increased ten fold although I didn't feel like I had much of a problem with it when I was smoking. Control over my emotions has increased although it is still far away from where I need to be. My work outs are more efficient thanks to my breathing. This might be TMI or disgusting to read but even after a long day in traffic/pollution my sputum is clear in the mornings. I can smell cigs from a mile away now and the smell pretty much disgusts me. I have gone drinking with friends who smoke and although I didn't want to stand next to them I was able to without my drive to smoke firing up. That's all I can think of at the moment. I am almost tempted to say that I have kicked the habit for good. But I promised myself I cant say that until I have not smoked for as many years that I have smoked. So, 14 years and change to go.

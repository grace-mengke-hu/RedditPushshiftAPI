Day 5 and happy to be here!

Found this subreddit through the Smoke Free app, which has been helping me through this process a lot. Every day has a bit of a struggle (I have a three-year-old spitfire daughter, one reason why I'm quitting and also the source of much of my stress). What are some distractions you all use when you're smacked in the face with a craving?

Edit: I am calling it day five, since five days ago was my last cig, but it's day 4 completely smoke free.

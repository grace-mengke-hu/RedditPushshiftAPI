Day 700! Happy New Year!

High 5's to all of you fellow former smokers! Stay strong and keep fighting the good fight.

The way I see it... by choosing to quit, we give ourselves a true test of character and determination. A test where we get to scream "CHALLENGE ACCEPTED!!!" and to prove to ourselves & those around us that we're one of those who can do this thing. And don't let a slip up change your goal. Nearly no one quits for good on the 1st try.

Hang tough, be determined that the tobacco industry will no longer own you, and watch your life change for the better.

Happy New Year /r/stopsmoking !

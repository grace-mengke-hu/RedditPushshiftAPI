Im sick and tired of smoking. I feel like throwing up.

Ive been smoking continuously for the past year and a half around half a pack to a pack every day. I think my body has had enough. I drank two days ago and smoked over a pack. I couldnt get up all of saturday and barely functioned today. Im sick and tired of smoking. I dont want to smoke anymore. Please help me quit smoking r/stopsmoking. Im thoroughly disgusted with this habit. I can barely breathe or walk properly. I gained 20 lbs from smoking and not exercising. Im done with this shit. Im so angry at myself for letting myself go like this.

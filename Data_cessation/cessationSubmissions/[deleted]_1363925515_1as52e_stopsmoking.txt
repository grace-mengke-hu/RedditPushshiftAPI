Time to put my money where my mouth is...

I'm just sick and tired... Literally

It's 4am now and I have to be up for work at 8. This is the fifth night in a row I've been like this and I'm just so fed up with it. What's keeping me up is the fact that I have this excruciating pain in my left shoulder and I'm having palpitations and its all down to smoking.

I'm just back from the kitchen where I've just soaked my last few and tossed them in the bin where they belong. I've been lurking on here for the past year or so, waiting for the "right time" and so I've decided to put my money where my mouth is and make a post.

I've tried quitting before but this time is the only time fuelled by fear of personal health rather than the superficial "stop smoking top reasons" we know we should follow.

I've spent the last 5 hours in bed taking my mind off the shortness of breathe and dizziness by planning a new gaming PC build so I've decided I'm going to put the cigarette money away each day and build that mother!!!

Thanks for all the advice you guys have posted on here while I just lurked. It's time I showed you guys some respect and started taking it...

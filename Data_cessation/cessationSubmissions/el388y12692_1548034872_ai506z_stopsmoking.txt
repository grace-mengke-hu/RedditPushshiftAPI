I haven’t smoked a cigarette in a week

I know my previous post said that I wanted to quit before I tuned 26, but I’ve been 26 for a little over a month. I kept telling myself that I need to ween myself off and I was wrong. I kept giving myself room for more excuses and reasons to keep smoking. Which was so so so dumb. I wish I quit a month ago like I said I would. It’s only been one week and I don’t think I haven’t stopped crying in 48 hours. I’m coughing up giant BLACK globs of whatever the fuck. My head is throbbing, I’m so irritable/sensitive and I did I mention how much everything makes me ugly sob? 
But it’s been a week. One whole long ass week and I haven’t smoked a single cig. I took breathing and singing for granted. I ran up the stairs to make the el on time and I didn’t even get winded. Maybe that’s all psychological and it’s too early to tell, but I feel great. 
Anyways I’m just saying, if I can do it, you can do it.

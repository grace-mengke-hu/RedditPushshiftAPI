Anyone other quitters out there having dreams about smoking.

The dreams aren't really about having and enjoying an actual cigarette - its more of a realization in my dream that I just had a cigarette and my streak is over (105 days now). I always wake up thinking "Oh man, I guess I got to start again.....oh wait! Phewsh"

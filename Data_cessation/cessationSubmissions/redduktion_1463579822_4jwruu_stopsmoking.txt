Day 2

I haven't touched a cigarette. They are everywhere but I have avoided them. I have had 5 coffees and about 100000 pieced of gum. I have also been chewing a business card constantly. 


PLEASE someone tell me this gets easier. I have a trigger coming up tonight (recess at evening school) and am very worried I will lapse. How do you get through those moments? After Lunch was difficult but I had people around for strength. This won't be the case tonight.

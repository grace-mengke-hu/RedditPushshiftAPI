So I left something in my jacket

This happened a few weeks ago, but telling the story now. I woke up on the weekend, doggo was begging me to take him out, I put on my winter jacket and in my pocket I felt a cigarette in my pocket. I was so happy, omg now I have a smoke no need to search for my pack this morning, now where the hell is my lighter. The craving was downright painful, I couldn't wait to get outside and.... wait that's a pen in my pocket not a cigarette. Oh yea I quit almost two years ago...... Then the craving lingered a bit but went away. Moral to the story? Yea addiction lingers, but that was my first craving in many many months, maybe a year, so if you're trying to make sure next year you are where I am now don't worry about the future, it gets easier.

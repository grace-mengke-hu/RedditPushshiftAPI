This is my last one.

I've decided to quit. My chest hurts and I'm only 20 years old. I smoke about a pack a day. I wake up coughing my lungs out for at least 5 minutes. I got kicked out of my last house for smoking. I can't voice act without being out of breath, I can't walk up hills without panting, I can't sing for very long. Im done. 

Now that my melodramatic rant is over, any tips on getting free of this habit? I am going cold turkey, which won't be hard cuz I'm broke for a week anyway.

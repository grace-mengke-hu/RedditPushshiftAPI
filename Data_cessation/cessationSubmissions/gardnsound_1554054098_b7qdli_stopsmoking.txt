I got through the weekend!

Hey There!

&amp;#x200B;

I got through the weekend without smoking.  Staying in really helped.  Even if I had gone out without my own pack, I know it would have been too easy to bum a cig from another bar goer.  Getting through the week should be OK.  I had a few really trippy dreams involving doctors and wasps, but other than that I've been ok.  Sort of irritable; nothing serious.

My brother's bachelor party is this coming weekend, and I plan on being the DD so that I can't / won't drink and that will make it a lot easier to say no.  I'll share a beer with him at home or something, instead.

Ya'll are great.  Thanks for the support!

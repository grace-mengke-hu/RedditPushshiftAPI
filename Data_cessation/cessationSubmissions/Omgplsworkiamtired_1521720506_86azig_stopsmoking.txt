My skin 5 weeks quit

I do not have acne around my mouth and the bumps around my sides and chest are gone. 

I do not miss them at all. 

Me quitting also has my mom wondering how I did it. She usually thinks I am less able than her in everything so she is honestly perplexed and wants to quit because I did and I must not do better than her. Lol

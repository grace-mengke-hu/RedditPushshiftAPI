Well I started smoking again after almost 3 years of being quit.

I don't really know why I started again. Why did it all of a sudden seem so appealing? Anyway, I'll be exploring those problems now. 

A couple of months ago on vacation I had one. Then by the end of the week I was smoking 10 per day. When I came back from vacation I stopped rather easily. Then a few weeks ago I would have one when drinking. Then my friend and I went on vacation, I went into full smoker mode, complete with being out of breath walking up a set of stairs.

Anyway, I was in the best shape of my adult life before this relapse, so I think my biggest issue is understanding why I went back. Thanks everyone for your support.

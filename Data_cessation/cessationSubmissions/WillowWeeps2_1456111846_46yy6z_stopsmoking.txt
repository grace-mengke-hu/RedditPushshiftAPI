I almost cheated. Came really close!

I've made it 2 weeks today. I know a lot of you don't like this, but I'm on the patch. This route is the only one I know I can stay on. I was doing good with my straws and gum and then out of curiosity, I went to see if my husband still keeps his smokes in the drawer. He still does and I wanted to light up soooo bad. I even held one in my hand and smelled it. But, I put it back and popped a tic tac and distracted myself. I'm going to ask him to hide them better from me. But, right now I want to cry. I want one so bad.

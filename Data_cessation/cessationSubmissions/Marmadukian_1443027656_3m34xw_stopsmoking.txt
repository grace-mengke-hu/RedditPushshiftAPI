I'm smoking the last (broken) smoke in my house.

My province has banned flavored tobacco, which includes menthol smokes. The full ban doesn't take effect till the end of the month, but distributors stopped shipping in the middle, and now all the places near me are out because everyone stocked up. since I can't stand regular smokes, this is my last one.

I'm going to eat, then play fallout new vegas all day. wish me luck and determination.

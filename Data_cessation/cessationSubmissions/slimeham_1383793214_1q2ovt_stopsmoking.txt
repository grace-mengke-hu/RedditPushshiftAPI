What I've noticed in that last 100 days

You can always tell whether someone is a never-smoker, current smoker, or an ex-smoker by how they react when you tell them that you have quit smoking.

The never-smoker will say that you did a good job with no enthusiasm and may chastise you for ever having picked up the habit in the first place.

The current smoker will congratulate you with a begrudged hint of jealousy. You can tell that, even though they know it's wrong, they wish you hadn't quit (I was guilty of this anyhow).

Then there are the other ex-smokers. They'll celebrate with you, they'll cheer with you, and they'll proactively ask you how you are doing with your quit. That's you guys and you're awesome.

Thanks for the support over the last 100 days, /r/stopsmoking!

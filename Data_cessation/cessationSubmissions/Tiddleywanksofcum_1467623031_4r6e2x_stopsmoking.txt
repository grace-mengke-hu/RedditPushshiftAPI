I'm coming up to a month of cold turkey and I can't stop snapping at loved ones..

So I gave up nearly a month ago and was smoking a pack a day for 13 years. Never tried before and I'm seeing the health benefits. more energy, lack of horrible taste in my mouth, blood pressure down, etc. 

I should have done this years ago.. I know this now. The only thing I can't seem to stop is come 19:00 I get very very irritable and have a tendency to snap at my partner. 

I love my her, she has been more than supportive through all of this I don't want to snap at her. Once 20:30 ish ( maybe earlier )  comes along I'm completely normal again. I don't have cravings, none that last longer than a few minutes but I still stay in this mood for an hour or two. I think its affecting our relationship at this stage. She doesn't say that, But I can't see how it couldn't.. 

Did anyone else have similar experience? What did you do? How did you get over it?

Day Six - Why has it been sooooo bad?

Hi!

I reached my sixth day today and I can say without a shadow of a doubt its been my worst day by far is that usual? I was expecting to feel like this after I first quit!  Its taken nearly four hours of feeling very low and "negotiating" with myself about why I should smoke and why I shouldn't smoke, I didn't smoke I am pleased to say but the cravings have been terrible do they get better? Any advice would be most appreciated

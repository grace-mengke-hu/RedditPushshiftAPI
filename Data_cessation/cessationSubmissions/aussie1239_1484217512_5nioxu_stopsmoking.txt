After a little advice.

So for a little background I've been a smoker for the last three years. Started off as a light, almost social smoker. And have sort of fluctuated between heavy and light smoking since then. 

Anyway, I've cut down massively the last two months. From about 25-30 a day to 6 at the most. I also switched from tailored cigarettes to rolling tobacco with super slim filters. 

Feeling pretty good so far. Quit date is set for the 18th. Only issue I've had so far is coughing and sneezing fairly thick, discolored mucus. I realised that it was probably my body starting to repair once I noticed the little bits of tar and such being cleared. 

Anybody else have experience with this? I'd be lying if I said that it didn't have me more than a little concerned. So yeah, help me anecdotally overcome this anxiety.

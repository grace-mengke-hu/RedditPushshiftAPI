Vent about day 3.

I relapsed last May and have been hiding my smoking from everyone.  In November, a massive project with a short deadline sent me back to smoking full time.  Granted it was two packs a week, but it was to the point that I was sending my husband on errands or going to the gym just so I could have a few moments alone to smoke.  

Driving. To. The. Gym. So. I. Could. Smoke. On. The. Way.

I hate the guilt and dishonesty.  As well as the anxiety about the smell, who knew, when was I going to have time to myself and so forth.  Here I am at day 3 and the need for a puff is making me want to drive to the gas station for a pack.  Oddly enough today I don't want to drive to the gym because I don't want to have to deal with the added pressure of not smoking while I'm driving.

I know exercise is the best thing, but today I just want to be a bump on a log.

I'm not ready to give it up yet.

I love smoking. Morning smoke, after coffy smoke, smoke before bed, wake up in the mittle of the night and take a walk smoke. It's just such a big part of my life. All my friends smoke too so that wouldn't help me with quitting. My mother is quitting this week, and my stupid big ass promiced to quit also... I DON'T FUCKING WANT TO QUIT! But it's just I would break her heart if I didn't, and fuck man. Sorry, i'm just rambling and i'm drunk so writing skills are not the best at the moment. You know what? I'm gonna go outside and I'm gonna have a smoke.

Need some support right now guys

First Friday after quitting. Fiance and I both work 2 jobs. This is usually the time when we we finally get to relax, have some cocktails, and sit on the balcony. She's not in quit mode yet. I'm 5 days in. Could use some support and/or tips on talking me off the proverbial tobacco ledge. Love this sub btw. Hoping to someday be as strong willed as some other people on here

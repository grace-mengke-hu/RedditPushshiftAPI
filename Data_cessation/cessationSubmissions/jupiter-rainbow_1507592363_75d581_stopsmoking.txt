Any tips for people with super bad anxiety?

So last week my health anxiety was in full swing and I decided that tomorrow would be my quit date. I did all the prep work: got the smoke free app, told everyone I know, got the allen carr book, got my mind right (or so I thought), everything. Then today I had a dr appointment....

I was getting more and more anxious about quitting. I kept going back and forth from “I can do this!” To “omg no I can’t and you’re going to let everyone down!” The nurse took my blood pressure and it was 150 over something (I was so shocked I didn’t even hear the other number). My blood pressure has never gone above 120. Then the dr came in and it was 152 and my pulse was 94. I then had a full fledged panic attack right then and there because I was scared about my blood pressure being that high. Talk about embarrassing.

The dr actually said “yes you are going to quit smoking, but you aren’t doing it tomorrow, you need to prepare more first  and get your anxiety under control “. Then I started crying and panicking again because I have been smoking way too long and I’m tired of worrying about my health all the time. He said if tomorrow I feel calm to go ahead with the plan. The problem is I just can’t seem to get there like a normal person can and it’s just so frustrating.

I’m halfway through the allen carr book and he keeps reiterating having the right frame of mind and it’s making me anxious because I can’t seem to make myself think the way he says to. It’s all because of my stupid dumb garbage shit anxiety that I can’t control. But smoking is one of the biggest causes of my health anxiety! Aghghg!!

Is there anybody out there who struggles hardcore with anxiety just thinking about quitting or anxiety about staying a smoker? I feel disappointed in myself that I can’t just handle this like regular people. I’m pretty much hating myself right now and my quit day isn’t even until tomorrow!

Yesterday was my one month mark! It came with my first real test.

The weekend of my one month mark was the toughest to get through so far.  I had a friend's wedding to go to Friday night.  A lot of friends had come in for the wedding and then to hang out Saturday night, too.  It was a little tough at first to be around my smoker friends and not have a cigarette.  It had been a little while since I had seen them, so when they went outside, I'd go with them.  I never had one though.  In fact, I caught myself thinking later on in the night that I didn't actually want a cigarette, I just wanted to satisfy my old habit (being with friends, drinking, I'm supposed to be smoking).  This was a big victory for me.  In past attempts, drinking with friends is what always got me hooked again.  I know not to put myself in these situations regularly, but it was good to get through the weekend successfully.

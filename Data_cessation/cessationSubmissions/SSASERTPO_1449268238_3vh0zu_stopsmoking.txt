How much nicotine from a lozenge is actually absorbed?

Hey guys! So i've been doing some reading and from what I have read only 1-2mg of nicotine from a cig are actually absorbed by the body. 

Meanwhile these lozenges I got are 4mg of nicotine. All that nicotine can't be going into my body right? I guess it does get absorbed over a period of time, but I am not a normal smoker and that much nicotine would probably destroy me. So I'm guessing that the amount absorbed is much less than 4mg. 

Any ideas?

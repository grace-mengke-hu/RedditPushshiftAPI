33 Hours, attempt 4?

So I'm one full day and a morning into quitting cold turkey for I think the 4th attempt. The furthest I made it before was about 2 weeks. I was really frustrated because everything I read said the intensity would decrease after a week and it didn't seem to at all for me. I picked it up again but smoked a very decreased amount for a few months (use to be almost a full pack, down to 4-6 smokes daily), quit completely for a few days, smoked a couple one day, back and forth for a bit, but overall I did manage to substantially decrease my intake. I'm trying cold turkey again, and I hope the intensity won't be as bad after having reduced for a while.

A friend told me that it takes an average of 8 attempts for someone to quit, is there truth to that? It almost feels a little defeating. Also, do you think decreasing the amount before cold turkey will help? Or was I just fooling myself?

Thanks, and keep up the good work :)

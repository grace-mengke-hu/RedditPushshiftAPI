Day 3 and I feel like gnawing on a piece of wood.

Welp, it's been over 72 hours since my last smoke. I'm extremely pleased with myself, but I honestly feel like chewing on a piece of wood. The oral fixation has been the worst part thus far. For those that experienced this, how long did it take to disappear? I've heard the first three day are the worst, in terms of physical withdrawal symptoms. So, if that holds true I should (theoretically) be in clear after today?

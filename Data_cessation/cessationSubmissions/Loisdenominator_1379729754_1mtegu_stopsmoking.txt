3 things I have learned in 3 months of not smoking

1) **there are real benefits to be gained, read about them.**
Just like I summarily dismissed the negative effects of smoking, my mind never dwelled too long on all the good things I could gain from quitting either. That is the drug taking over your brain.

2)**I admitted that nicotine is a highly addictive substance, even to me, super human that I am, having thought that perhaps I could control it.**
As long as I kept supplying the drug, I was setting myself up for failure and slowly chipping away at my dignity and self respect. Until I realized that there are no magic solutions (sorry ecig users), I was not able to set a definite plan in motion. If you want to be free of dependence on the addictive substance that is nicotine, you have to avoid nicotine.

3) **if I can quit smoking after 21 years and multiple failed attempts, I can do pretty much anything I set my mind to.**
At least it feels that way. I can channel that energy that kept me smoking for far too long into much more interesting things. As a bonus, I feel more confident, less rushed, and less anxious.

It was actually on this sub that I found out that it does not take 3 weeks to create (or break) a habit as I thought, but rather 3 months. This was my next big milestone I had been looking forward to, and here I am. Quite happy, still on guard, wondering why I didn't quit sooner, and feeling very disassociated from the version of me who used to smoke.

Like I was discussing with /u/esolu recently, we smokers tend to paint ourselves into a corner, trying to avoid the reality that we are engaging in a self destructive act. At a certain point, we run out of room and can no longer deny that we are trapped and there is no way out other than to choose to quit.

If you are lurking here, like many of us started off, you are already in the right frame of mind. How much room do you have left? How much longer will you put it off? If not now, when?

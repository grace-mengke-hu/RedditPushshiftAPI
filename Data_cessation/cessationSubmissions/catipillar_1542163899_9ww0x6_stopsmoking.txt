Made it two days and I broke

I have no idea what to do about the NEXT LEVEL irritability. I channeled all of my gnashing craving into horror level bitch mode. I'm smoking right now and all of the sudden this MASSIVE, SEETHING RAGE has just melted right off me. I want to try again but I have no idea how to stop being a hellcunt. Tips are needed desperately.

Proud of myself. Broke up with GF. Didn't start again.

Just going through a breakup with the now ex-gf. 

A lot of my last quits have failed as I would hit a stressful time in my life and go straight back to them. This time I haven't.

Cigarettes will not bring back your relationship
Cigarettes will not numb the pain of the hurt.
Starting again WILL MAKE YOU FEEL MORE WORSE ABOUT YOURSELF THAN YOU ALREADY ARE.

Reward system for quitting smoking?

I lasted 11 months last time I quit smoking..11 months!!! - previous record was 7.

BUT MY stupid ass had to go back to it - I am trying to not smoke again, I had a barium swallow a couple months ago I had trouble swallowing food - doctor said nothing was found (thinking it could have been cancer) turns out it is gerd - said losing weight and quitting smoking would more than likely fix the issue.

I have tried cold turkey numerous times - it worked for my record breaking of 11 months but for some stupid reason a thought entered my mind saying "Lets just see if you even have an appeal for it anymore?" so I bought a pack of cigarettes and I have regretted it ever since. I have thought about a reward system of going x amount of days, months, years of not smoking but I can't get past the logic of "Pshhhh I can just buy that now"

I figure every week that goes by: Buy something special on the condition that not ONE cigarette was smoked (mostly food related like a grinder from my favorite sub shop)

I can't even think of a reward for months/years - maybe a week reward system would work? I don't know. How did you all quit? My willpower is shot and I flat out hate myself everytime I smoke. I literally about an hour ago ran my cigarettes under the stream of water in my sink.

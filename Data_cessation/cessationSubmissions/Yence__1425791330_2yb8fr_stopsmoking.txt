Badge reset, gave up for two weeks - back to it.

So about 3 weeks ago after 6 weeks, I started smoking again, it was just foolish. I thought I was still struggling and couldn't keep it up, but now that I'm smoking again I just realized that I forgot how hard it actually was to quit. I wasn't struggling at all any more - I missed it a bit sometimes but it went away.

So now I'm gonna have to go through the withdrawal all over again, I only made it harder for myself. I'm not as motivated now to quit again, but I kinda liked how independent of cigarettes I was after 6 weeks (the time after which I started smoking again) - so I'll keep that as a goal.

One mistake I won't be making again: smoking weed. Even smoking it without tobacco, which I did, probably a bit like giving alcoholfree beer to an ex-alcoholic. Bad idea, it awakens something in your mind. No nicotine whatsoever, no smoking of anything whatsoever.

I hope this will really be it. Finished the pack, aired out my flat, emptied and cleaned the ashtrays. Badge reset requested.

Hardest Part About Quitting?

New to this sub but wanted to speak objectively on the subject of quitting. Trying to counsel my cousin who's a pack/day addict at the moment to help her quit.

What are the hardest parts about quitting I should be aware of? 

I obviously hear about going cold turkey, but is there anything that's lest sudden and dramatic? Like cigarettes with lower nicotine content or anything of that sort?

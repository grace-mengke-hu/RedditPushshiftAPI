vaping feels like cheating - but is it?

hey everyone - I quit smoking a little over 3 weeks ago by getting myself a vape with nicotine. I know this is the best option for me, since before that, I had tried to quit so many times and, as my friend says, quitting is already hard enough, there's no reason to make it even harder for yourself.

BUT I still can't help but feel like vaping and still ingesting nicotine is somehow cheating, like I didn't really quit.

has anyone else felt like this? how did you deal with it?

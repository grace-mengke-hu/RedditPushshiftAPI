New to Reddit; trying to quit

Today is day 1 of my latest attempt to quit smoking. I tried looking for a couple of support groups on Facebook and basically got a lot of bullshit about expressing myself... But PC. How the fuck am I supposed to be PC through withdrawal when I'm barely PC on a regular basis. Anyway, someone pointed me to this page so I'm giving it a shot. I need somewhere filled with people who understand. Who aren't gonna wave pom-poms in my face, mention a celestial being, or tell me I can't curse. Lol. Yay day 1!!! Here's to not murdering people!

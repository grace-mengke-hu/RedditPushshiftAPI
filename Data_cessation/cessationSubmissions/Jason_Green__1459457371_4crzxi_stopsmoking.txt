Day 1. Gonna be a tough ride.

Hey guys!

28 year old dude here, been smoking pack a day for 13 years.
Last weekend I was drinking 3 days straight and when I drink, I smoke a lot. So when I woke up monday morning I had this weird chest pain and got all anxious and decided it was time to give up smoking. 

I got myself an e-cig with nicotine juice yesterday to help me out on this journey. The plan is to lower the amount of nicotine to zero once the hardest part is over.

First day almost done, it's 23:49 or 11:49 PM here, and so far so good, but the thing that worries me most is that ALL of my closest friends smoke. I guess I'll have to spend some time alone in the beginning so I won't slip...

Wish me luck!

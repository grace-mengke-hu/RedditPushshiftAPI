Slipped today. First cig sense last Monday. My lungs are disappointed.

Mornings are tough. I needed a reward for waking up. I haven't had a cig sense last Monday when I was admitted to ICU for 4 days due to the flu and asthma. I wish I could have bottled that feeling I had when I literally couldn't breath and had to go to the E.R at 2 in the morning. Cigs could kill me but I've been smoking sense I was 12 and I'm 29 now. I don't know any other way of life. This is just a road bump.  That cig didn't make me feel any better. I want another one and that one won't make me feel better either. My partner quit with me and I don't want to disappoint him either. 

Today is day 1 but it's okay

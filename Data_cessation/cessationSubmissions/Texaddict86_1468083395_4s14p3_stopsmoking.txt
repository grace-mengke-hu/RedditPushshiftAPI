Smoking is just a symptom

I am an addict...I come from 2 HARD CORE DRUG ADDICTS, if i hadn't chosen cigarettes in college another substance would have taken hold.  Now that I know and understand this...can I really quit smoking and not fall into something else (sex, gambling, drugs) without dealing with the underlying issues causing the addiction need in the first place?

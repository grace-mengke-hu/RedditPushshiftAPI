When do you feel better?

Yesterday the lady at the barber shop was like "oh you quit smoking I bet you feel so much better." Gave the the bad news I dont feel any different at all.

I will be 2 weeks on Monday via the Cold Turkey Express. I don't feel any different. Maybe even feel a bit worse because I feel the same but am also super anxious all the time now.

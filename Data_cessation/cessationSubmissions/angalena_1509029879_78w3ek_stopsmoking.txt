Morn One:as this is my 3rd serious attempt to quit a 21 year habit, I knew this would happen. Laying in bed not wanting to move cause the craving is so bad. Realizing Iâ€™m finding excuses to buy a pack &amp;do it slowly instead of cold turkey. ie moms coming, big week @work. Just need to get up &amp;move.

After 15 years smoking a pack a day, I made it 24 hours without a cigarette...and it was easy!

Ok, so I know it’s just the first day and it’s a long road ahead, but I finished listening to Allen Carr’s Easy Way to Quit Smoking last night and extinguished my last cigarette. Thing is, I was excited for it. I was excited to be done with smoking. So when I woke up this morning, I was pumped to be a non-smoker.  Most of the day it was easy. I didn’t feel any real cravings, just a voice or feeling telling me it was time for a cigarette. During those times, I reminded myself how good it was to not be smoking and that a cigarette would do nothing for me. The hardest part of the day was after dinner. During dinner, I kept getting the image of me going out for my after dinner smoke. I kept repeating my mantra and though I knew I wasn’t smoking, I kept getting the pang and the picture in my head. So yeah, the hardest part is having to keep turning down offers from myself throughout the day. 

My biggest victory today was turning down an actual cigarette from a business acquaintance earlier this evening.  He’s known me as a smoker, but I just politely refused and said I don’t smoke anymore. No explanation, no fuss, and no temptation, because I already made up my mind I won’t smoke again. 

Again, I know it’s just my first day and I’m sure there are plenty of challenges ahead , but day 1 was so much easier than I had imagined. Thanks to this sub for so much support.  Today I am 6 months clean from weed, 17 days clean from alcohol, and 1 day free from cigarettes!

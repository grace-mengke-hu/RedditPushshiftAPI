Does my reward seem odd?

I haven’t smoked for 35 days now, and It feels pretty good. But I still crave it everyday. 

One of my favourite times to smoke is when I go on vacation to a tropical place, and I have a trip booked for about 3 months down the road. 

So when I go on the trip I will be 4 months smoke free, and I fully intend on smoking while on the trip. Almost as a reward for being so good. 

But here’s another thing I’m thinking. I really enjoy smoking, and wouldn’t be against doing it every now and then. Like one weekend out of a month, when I drink, or when I’m on vacation. 

Just like alcohol, I feel like if you don’t have a problem with it (do it every day) then it’s not really a issue. Obviously it’s better to not smoke or drink ever, but I feel like if I’ve got a healthy handle on it, it’s worth the negative effects it possibly has on me. 

But like I said. I want to hit that 4 month mark before I reward myself I’m thinking. 

What do you guys think?

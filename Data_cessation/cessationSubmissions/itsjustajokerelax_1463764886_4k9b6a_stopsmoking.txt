My lungs feel worse now than before quitting. Anyone else?

info: smoked 11 years 

first week of quitting

age: upper 20's


Like the title, after quitting smoking, I noticed my lungs have the capacity of a small rodent. everywhere I go, I seem out of breath. 

Before quitting, I exercised daily lifting weights and riding my bike. It never seemed like I was this winded. Why does it seem worse after quitting?! Anyone else have similar experience?

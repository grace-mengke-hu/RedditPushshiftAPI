I would like to thank my wife

Short story, I went 20 hours from Sunday to Monday afternoon when i caved at lunch time. That night my wife had the best idea ever! She said, "don't smoke tomorrow and you'll get a BJ!" "Are you serious!" I replied "its not even close to my birthday."

So I tried again on Tuesday and I did it! 24 hours smoke free! I got my BJ! And I feel even better for not smoking. Afterwards my wife looks at me and says, now go two more days and you'll get another one! This has made these first 3 days unbelievably easy! 

So, all you ladies who want your man to quit, you now know what to do!

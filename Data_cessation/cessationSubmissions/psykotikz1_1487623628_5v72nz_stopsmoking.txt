Introductions 29/m/ny smoking on/off for 10 years

So I started smoking around 16/17 and prob smoked about 7-8 years in total including the times I've quit. It's actually strange that I've quit 3-4 times for year+ long periods and have gone back each time. My most recent quit was 2 years ago where I switched to vaping. I noticed that I felt A LOT better vaping then I did smoking but after 2 years I actually think vaping took a toll of its own. 

Switching from vaping to smoking recently made me feel better health wise(this happened about 6 months ago. I haven't been smoking like I did back in the day 4-5 cigs a day as opposed to a pack. 

The thing I hate more than anything is that my life (other than my health) improves with smoking. I'm a lot happier/less anxiety/more motivated. I know it sounds crazy but I just want to feel the way I do when I smoke WITHOUT smoking. 

Anyways - it's nice to be a part of this group and I'll look forward to the battle with you guys!

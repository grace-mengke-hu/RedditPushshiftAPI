Just smoked my last cigarette

I've started smoking this summer, due to a lot of parting. I'm 23, so that act of smoking was really dissapointing for me, because so many times before I said no even though I was surrounded by smokers. I live in Europe. This summer I was parting and  being a drunk idiot I thought I'm better than everybody else and I tried my first cigarette.  I smoked for 3 months. My husband is a regular smoker, so it became quickly a habit. I stopped for two weeks, first 3 days were hell, but I was getting off other things as well. My hell mood swings might be connected to other things as well.
After one week I felt wonderful. I didn't smoke for a month and then I slipped again. It's been almost a month of smoking. I've delayed my quitting because I was afraid of mood swings. However, it's been getting crazy again, I need 2 cigarettes in the morning to wake up, and last night I really felt a need to just get up and smoke one. My morning mood is shit. My lungs hurt. My skin is slowly starting to give up on me. I'm constantly disappointed in myself. So, I guess I'm not loosing much if I quit smoking. Here I'm, on reddit, making a decision again.  I'm quitting! 

 My husband is still a smoker. He will quit later, because if he quits with me we will make out of our lives hell. We work from home, so it would be quite troubling. However, he is my biggest temptation. Last time I slipped it was because I heard him light a cigarette. If anybody had a similar situation please give me some advice, I will appreciate it.

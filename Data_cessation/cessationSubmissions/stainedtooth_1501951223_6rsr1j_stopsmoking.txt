19 y/o, smoker, need help.

I lit my first cigarettes on new years, 2016. It's been 18 months and I have smoked almost everyday since then. It just felt amazing. Not just the morning buzz, but what it stood for. For the depressed, lost teenager, it provided structure. For the shy introvert, it provided doors to first conversations and so many friendships. 
My addiction to cigarettes is more than physical. For the past 18 years, I've seen it as the glue to my life. 

But I need to quit.
I'd be lying if I said my health has not significantly diminished. 
My lips are strikingly dark, 2 of my teeth are stained and I can barely run for 10 minutes without wheezing. 
I'm on day 2 and it has been extremely difficult so far. My chest feels congested, my head hurts and I can't fall asleep. Earlier today, in a moment of weakness, I gave up and walked to the store to get my fix but managed to fight it off on the way and walked back.
This is extremely difficult. Slowly, the reason I've been giving myself, that my health is diminishing, seems to be becoming weaker and weaker. 
I need motivation to quit.

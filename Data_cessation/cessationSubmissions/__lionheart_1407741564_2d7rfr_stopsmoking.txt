I'm Having Trouble Quitting

I've been smoking about a half a pack, to a pack a day, on and off (mostly on of course) for about three and a half years now. I know I should quit. Hell, I think I even want to, but I don't know why I can't do it. I feel very weak because I have tried many times, and haven't been able to fully stop.

My dad died at a young age (34 to be exact) due to unhealthy life choices. That's what my mom says anyways. I was too young to remember what really happened. I notice that my breathing is very labored and I can't run long distances anymore like in early high school. I hide it from my family because I don't want them disappointed in me, but I'm sure they know anyway. My boyfriend doesn't like it. He says it's not a determining factor of whether or not he stays with me, but I know he hates it. His mom had gotten lung cancer due to smoking. She survived, but is very weak now.

I don't know what I'm looking for by posting this, I think I just needed someone to talk to about it that understands what I'm feeling, and a community that will support this.

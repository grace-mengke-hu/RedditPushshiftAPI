Three weeks no smoking!

I have three weeks clean from cigarettes!  I feel so much better!  I still have cravings and urges to smokes, but they are definitely getting fewer and farther between each one.  I've had some ups and downs with irritability and needing a lot of rest.  

My mantras:  I am a nonsmoker.  Nonsmokers do not smoke.  Don't smoke no matter what!  Stay strong!

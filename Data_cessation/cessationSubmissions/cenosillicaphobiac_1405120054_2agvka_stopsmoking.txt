What's working?

Hi all,

I tried this once before at the beginning of the year, and used Chantix, and somehow always found a way to justify why it was okay to have "just this one, and maybe 4 more from the pack over the next few days, as long as I throw the rest away".  The longest I made it was 8 fully legitimate days.  Needless to say, when the 3 months of Chantix was up, I quickly went back up to 15 or so a day.

I'm at it again, and on Chantix, and am at day 13 (I calculate hours this early on, and hit my 300 hours this morning).

What works?  As a first time dad at 45, although I'm quitting for myself, I really don't want my 5 month old to grow up with a smoker for a dad, and I want to be around for him.  Help!

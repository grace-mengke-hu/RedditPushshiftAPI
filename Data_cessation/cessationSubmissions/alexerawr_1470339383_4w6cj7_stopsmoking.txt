More than a month without smoking... But...

I'm really proud of me! I quit more than a month ago, helped myself with a vape with 3g nicotine! I tried once to smoke, it was awful and disgusting, the taste stayed in my mouth for an hour! Still, I miss the ''good'' taste that I know would take a few cigarettes to come back... But I dont miss smoking. 

There's only one  thing that I feel sometimes and it makes me so angry and makes me feel weird.. Sometimes, it feels like my unconscious waits for a cigarette and when I don't get it, I feel super disappointed and empty... 

For example, I do a 2 hours ride to go see my family. I never thought of smoking on the way, but when I'm finally there, I feel empty, like something's missing...

Am I the only one who have this feeling? Do you have any advice?

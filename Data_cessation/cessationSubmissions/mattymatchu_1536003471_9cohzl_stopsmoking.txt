I fucking smoked some last night

Well, kind of a lot.  I’ve been free and clear for over a year now, but the last few times I’ve gotten real drunk I find smokes. I’m not craving them in the morning or anything like that, but I feel like it’s a slippery slope. Any advice, besides the obvious, don’t get shitfaced all the time. Thanks everyone

Man, I have had some serious urges lately. I'm at about 5 months.

They aren't frequent at all but they are persistent when they do happen. I am currently sitting in my living room, house to myself for the weekend, 8 beers in and almost just went down to the store to grab a pack. 

I'm not, though. Just typing this out to you guys reminds me of what is wrong with that picture.

sure fucking sneaks up on ya' though, huh?

Help me

Hey Guys,
I havent smoked for like 3 weeks now and its been good. I have strong urge to smoke but i can handle it. But i do have a problem, my mind is playing games i Think.

I do not want to stop smoking, i Dont have Any problems with my Health or money. I do want a cigarette when i drink a beer. 

Its making it more difficult for me to actually not smoke, what can i do?

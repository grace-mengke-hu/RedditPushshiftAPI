Trying to get started

First post on this sub, pardon me if I’m breaking any etiquette. I started smoking when I was 14, and smoked off and on in high school. By the time I finished high school I was a pack a day smoker. When I was an off and on smoker, I used to stop smoking for a couple months and pick it back up slowly. I had quit cold turkey several times over this time period, mostly to see that “I can stop whenever I want”. Realizing I’ve been a smoker for the better part of a decade and that it’s inevitably caused me some harm, amongst other reasons. At the beginning of spring this year I tried to quit using the patch and I was succeeding, but stress got to me and I felt like I lost motivation to stay quit. I think I’m ready to try again and go buy some patches when my pack empties out tonight. What do you folks do to stay strong against cravings? Would you recommend the patch, a different cessation product, or cold turkey? What keeps you motivated to stay quit? Do you guys have any tips or pointers for making this a more effective attempt than before?

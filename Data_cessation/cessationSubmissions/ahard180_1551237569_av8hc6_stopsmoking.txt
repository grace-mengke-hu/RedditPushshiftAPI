What’s the best smoking but non tobacco alternative?

I don’t think it’s the nicotine for me, it’s the oral fixation and the ritual of lighting up and smoking. I don’t smoke that much probably a pack every couple weeks or a month but I can’t seem to really stop. 

Are there any good alternatives? I know smoking anything is gonna be at least a little bad but something that’s not as bad to wean myself off with? I tried cloves, later learned they aren’t much of an alternative, but absolutely hated the taste anyways so nothing that tastes like that.

I always vape, but it’s not the same. And I smoke weed but I don’t like to get high all the time so that doesn’t really work as an alternative either.


Thanks!!

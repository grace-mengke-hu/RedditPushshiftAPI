Alright I'm done.

I don't know what came over me, but it's 3am, and I just decided to quit.  I am 23 and have been smoking since I was 15.  I hid the rest of my pack at first, but after reading through this sub, I went and flushed them down the toilet.

So thanks you guys.  I appreciate it.  Wish me luck!

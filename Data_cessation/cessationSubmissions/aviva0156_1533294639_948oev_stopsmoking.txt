Music feels better??

About 2 days in this time, I’ve tried to quit a few times in the past but this time I’ve tried to get rid of anything that might tempt me and I’ve been doing really well!
A weird thing I’ve noticed that happens when I try and quit is that the tingles that happen at the base of your spine when I used to listen to music is back! I don’t know if anyone else noticed this or if this is just a weird fluke but it feels great and is a great motivator. 
It’s almost like my body is creating rushes to try and recreate the buzz I use to give it with nicotine?

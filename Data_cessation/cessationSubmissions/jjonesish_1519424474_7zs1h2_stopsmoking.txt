Quitter's flu. My throat is throbbing. Anyone have any soothing remedies that actually work?

So far, tea with honey and lemon isn't helping. Neither are pectin cough drops. Next up is a salt gargle and a steam bowl with eucalyptus oil. I'm thinking about getting a humidifier or something. This is killer.  

It's certainly keeping me from having another smoke though, so I guess I should be grateful.

1 week! :D

I relapsed for a few weeks, but now I have finally managed to quit. My body forced me, I had a terrible cold with flu symptoms. It's much better now, I still have remains of the smoker's flu but it's not as bad as during my previous attempt. At this pace, I will breathe clearly in less than a week.

Which is good, because I am training for triathlons and I want to be able to win them! :D

So, let's never get into this bullshit habit of smoking ever again, or I can forget about dreams like this

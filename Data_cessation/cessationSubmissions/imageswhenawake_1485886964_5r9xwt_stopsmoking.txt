It helps to think of "just one smoke" and "full relapse" as two sides of the same coin. You can't have one without the other.

Can you have a coin in your hand that's just heads? (excluding trick coins) To hold the coin, you also have to hold the 'tails'.

The "just one smoke" temptation is like that.  One on side of the coin, is "just one".  One the other side, is "full relapse for months, years, or your whole life".

If we pick up that coin to indulge in that "just one", we're picking up the 'full relapse'.  Can't have one without the other.

So when you're tempted for just one, realize there's a mandatory price to smoking just one.  It's a full relapse for god knows how long.

Good luck people, keep it up!

Has quitting smoking given anyone else some semblance of an identity crisis?

First off, I am so proud of myself and happy to say that I am confident that I will never smoke again! My cravings are almost completely gone, with their emergence only coming about when I get really angry (which I have found that my desire to not smoke has been helping me control my rage issues)


Moving on. I started smoking when I was 16, and am now 24. I smoked all through my formative years, and never really realized how much it became part of my identity until I decided to quit. On the whole, I care much more for myself than I did in past years and have made a lot of personal improvements including most recently quitting smoking and going to the gym. I never realized how much I identified with self-destruction and I guess a sort of nihilism. I am almost enjoying the feeling though it is quite odd to be 24 and feeling that teenage sense of self-mystification I once knew so well. How odd, to be baffled at the idea of caring so much about your life that you no longer want to endanger it unnecessarily! I have tried to communicate this to some of my friends but realize how funny it sounds.

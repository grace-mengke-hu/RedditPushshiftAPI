I need some help/ motivation

Hello everyone. My name is pk, and I have a nicotine addiction. 

... 

I smoked somewhere between a pack and two of Lucky Strikes a day from the age of 15 to 19 ish. At that point I jumped onto the Electronic Cigarette bandwagon, and have been with it since. I just cut down the nicotine amount I'm using to 3mg, about as low as you can get,  and am experiencing awful withdrawal. I haven't even quit,  and the withdrawal is killing me. Anxiety, feeling very unsettled. Angry, short,  and I have had an awful headache since I woke up. 

I want to quit. I know about the health risks. I don't want to spend the money,  the time, the fear of losing or forgetting my device. I'm completely emotionally dependent on my addiction,  and that's the issue. 

I really don't want to quit,  I just know it's what I should do,  and I want to enjoy the many benefits of not being addicted, but I feel stable where I am. To me,  losing the emotional crutch and dealing with withdrawal isn't worth the benefits. So I guess what I want,  is to want to quit. 

Side note: I had in the past been pretty active in the Electronic Cigarette/ PV community. I know they haven't been tested. I know that they are still bad for your health. It's just a matter of mitigating the health risks. I know that despite it being less dangerous, that doesn't mean they are doing me any favors. So I'm definitely not writing off the health effects. 

Tldr: I want to want to quit,  but I don't.

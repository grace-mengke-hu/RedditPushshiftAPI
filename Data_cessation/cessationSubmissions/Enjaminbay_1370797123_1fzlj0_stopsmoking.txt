A quick question for those of you who still smoke cannabis.

So, as I'm sure some of you know nicotine and THC make quite a nice combination.  For those of us attempting to avoid the former but not the latter however, there is one area that's a little gray: Cigarillos.  Specifically, there's a small amount of nicotine in the tobacco leaf wrap itself.  Has anyone on this sub noticed an uptick in cravings for a day or two after smoking blunts?

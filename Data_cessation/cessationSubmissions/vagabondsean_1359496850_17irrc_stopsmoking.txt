hard to focus?

So I'm on day 6 and up until today its been decently easy, I was very sick(Flu) for the first three days so I think thats why I was able to get over that hump with out much issue.

Today its very hard to concentrate and my brain just feels, for lack of a better term, jumbled up. Anyone else experience this?

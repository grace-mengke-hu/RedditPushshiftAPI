New guy! Got a question

Besides the normal rage which I assume pretty much consumes everyone in the initial few days after quitting, I wanted to ask whether it was normal to actually MISS smoking. I miss it. It's kinda worrying me that I feel this way, because I'm taking it to be a sign that I might be setting myself up for failure here. 

Has anyone else missed the idea of smoking? You know, taking those 5 minutes to get away from the rest of the world and whatnot?

Thanks!

Today is day two

I posted about a week ago 'I'm struggling so bad' then disappeared into the silo of shame and weakness as I brought filthy cig after cig to my mouth for another week. I had no idea 20 people would write offering ideas on their experience in quitting! Holy sh!t!!!  

Thank you

Today is day 2 and I feel strong. 

I've not had one, nor do I want one.  

I feel myself being testy and irritated at the world, but I resolve not to let anything be an excuse to start smoking.

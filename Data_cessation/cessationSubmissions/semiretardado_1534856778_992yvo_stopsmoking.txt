The sleep gets better immediately.

Got off nicotine in May. Was on patch and lozenges. . . .different combos, for about 7 months. I was really bad at getting a full 8 hours for the past couple years: smoking then on NRT. 

I'm about to unsubscribe from r/stopsmoking. It's helpful but my sleep is so good now, I will never go back to smoking. The second I was fully 3 days from nicotine, my ability to fall and stay asleep improved so dramatically that it was crystal clear nico-dependence had been causing all my problems.

Just wanted to tell you guys that before leaving. Bon voyage. Cigarettes are cancer sticks, tolerated by the ruling class so that the poor die off and don't need to be taken care of.  

Meditation is a great skill that will serve you well in your quit, if you learn to do it. 

Finally, use as much nicotine as you need to when you quit, just don't get it by combusting nicotine! Peace and Love,

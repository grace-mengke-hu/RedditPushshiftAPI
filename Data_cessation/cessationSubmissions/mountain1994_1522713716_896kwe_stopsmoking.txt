day 7 moving into day 8!

i spent half an hour today moving 200 70L soil bags with my friend (a huge crate of them) i would usually get very short of breath and lethargic doing this but although it was difficult, i seemed to recover very quickly, i wasnt short of breath and i felt kinda stronger

so far so good

12 hours without a cigarette. I feel like death.

I've been smoking for 8 years and for the past 5 months I've set today as a day to quit. I stomped out my last cigarette at midnight and threw away all of my cigarettes and lighters too. It's been about 12 hours now and I feel like death. The nicotine withdrawals are killing me. I can't sit still the compulsion and obsession over that little white and brown tube is killing me. I've been through withdrawals before but not for cigarettes. How do I cope with this? Is there any way to make it better?

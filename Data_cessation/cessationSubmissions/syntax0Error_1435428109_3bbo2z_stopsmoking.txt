The aggravation of quitting!

I have been 'trying' to quit for nearly two month now, and the last month consists of buying single cigarettes convincing myself it would be the last one, and I am yet to have one day of not smoking. At the start I wouldn't beat myself up and would be motivated to try again, but it has gotten to the point where I can not stop myself from feeling miserably every time I smoke. I have watched Allen Carr's Youtube video, not much of a reader. 

I realize there is a lot of 'try' in the post but 'Do or do not, there is no try' also did not work :( I am hopeless, sorry for the rant

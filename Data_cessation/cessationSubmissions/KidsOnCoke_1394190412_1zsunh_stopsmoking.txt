Fuck it

Fuck smoking. I've been putting off quitting for like a year, and this isn't planned at all. I just stumbled upon this subreddit and realised how much I hate this addiction and how I'll probably still be smoking next year if I don't quit right now. Threw my cigarettes out minutes ago, not even a 'last smoke forever'. This will be tough, this will be shitty, but no shittier than smoking. That's all I will have to remember, plus that it's all temporary and in my head. Wish me luck.

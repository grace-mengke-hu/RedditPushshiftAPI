I've picked my date, and what I plan to do. Suggestions?

Hey reddit. Hows it going? Long time lurker, first time poster (i think, unless I made a post years and years ago on a previous attempt. Doesn't matter, subscribed now).

Anyways, my birthday will be coming up shortly, and it will mark the 10 year anniversary of my dependency on nicotine and, most importantly, the cigarette. 

I've made 4 previous attempts at quitting. Some worked for a while, then my will caved due to work, stress, insert-lame-excuses -here. Nicotine replacement worked a hell of a lot better over cold turkey (three days on one attempt, one week on the second on cold turkey. Lost it due to lack of sleep).

The patch was too passive, I was getting my drug, but I was also drawn to the social aspect (group conversations among like-minded individuals at break time) and that would make me cave too (more lame excuses...). 

It's been two years since I've attempted, and this past month has made me make up my mind. I want to quit before I hit 10 years. Period. 

I'm trying out the nicorette inhaler, as I feel it helps with most, if not all the issues I previously had while trying to quit. There was a trial box and the big one with proper scheduling and quitting times, and my mind was made up already. 

Any other suggestions would be awesome. 

Official quit smoking tobacco products date is June 8th, 2015. As for stopping nicotine altogether, I'll be picking a date later down the road when I feel it's appropriate. 

My will is ready.

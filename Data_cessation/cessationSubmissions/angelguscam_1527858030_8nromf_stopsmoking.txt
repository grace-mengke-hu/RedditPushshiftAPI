19 Days! What's worked so far...

Exercise:. Been doing Yoga, which I hate but it helps, this has replaced my morning cigs
Mantra: the craving will pass whether I smoke or not, read this on here
Being okay with the process: depression, no energy, grouchy, anger, eating too much. Accepting this has enabled me to not give in to the rationalizing
Audio books in the car
This site, specifically information and others' process
The Smoke Free app, which is why I'm posting-todays challenge. 

A little bragging:. Was around my sister yesterday and I was really wanting to smoke but I didn't. This is a big trigger since we had some of our best talks sitting outside drinking and smoking. I've got to find a way to keep this up without smoking.

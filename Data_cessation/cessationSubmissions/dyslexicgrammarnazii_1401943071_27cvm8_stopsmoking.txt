I would like to quit now, Reddit.

Hello everyone. 
I'm a 23 year old male, living in California. I've been smoking since I was 15 years old. I have a past history of drug abuse, but I've been clean going on 4 years (this July 15th). As I'm sure many of you with similar back stories know quite well, it's the cigarette addiction that often continues; even once you get clean. Anyways, I feel its time that I quit the cigs too. I've tried several times before to quit, but finding this subreddit has inspired me to give it a go. I'm somewhat new to Reddit, and new to this subreddit, and I'm looking for any helpful advice (or simply someone to respond so I feel as if this act of quitting is official).


TL;DR ADVICE? Support? Use a patch/cold turkey?

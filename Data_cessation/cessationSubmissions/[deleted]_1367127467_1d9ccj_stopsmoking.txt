I just smoked cigarette butts. Gross.

I feel ridiculous...I hadn't smoked a cigarette in 6 days. I decided tonight I'd have a glass of wine or three. Of course, soon after I started drinking I started getting terrible cravings. Usually, I've been able to ignore them. I'll chew some gum or do something to distract myself until they go away. With the alcohol in my system, my better judgments were set aside. I NEEDED a smoke. Since I couldn't drive to get a pack, I did the next best thing I could. I scrounged around in my car for the few butts I had left in there. I dissected them and gathered the remaining tobacco. I smoked it out of my glass pipe. I felt victorious and excited as I salvaged the last bits of tobacco I had left to my name. I felt resourceful, scientific even. Now I feel stupid and gross. Did I really just smoke garbage? I was doing so well too. I guess I've learned my lesson; no drinking until I can get these cravings under control. Also, I need to clean out my car. It's like I need to babysit myself. This is so frustrating! It's back to square one tomorrow.

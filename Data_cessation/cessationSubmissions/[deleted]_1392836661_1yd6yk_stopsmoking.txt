What are some apps that helped you quit?

I am planning on quitting after 14 years of pack a day smoking. I see a lot of screenshots of apps and wanted to see if any app stands out. 

What other recommendations do you have since I am doing cold turkey?

I think I am mentally ready to pull the plug anytime now.

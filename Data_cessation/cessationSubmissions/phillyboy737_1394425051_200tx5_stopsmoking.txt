Struggling at 3 months

I'm three months in and just had my first smoke free birthday in 10 years. But I'm having such a hard time these last few weeks. Been craving so hardcore that i have to drive an extra 45 min each way to work every day to avoid all corner stores to avoid buying more smokes.  

Just wanted to say thanks to all of you guys for helping me stay strong and resist the urge.

Can't stop won't stop

This has to be the 100th time I've tried to quit. 4 days solid this time. I recently moved into a smoking house and am the odd adult out not smoking. I had faltered when socializing before I moved in, then the holiday stress had me up to 6-8 a day again. Any advice for living with smokers would be awesome.

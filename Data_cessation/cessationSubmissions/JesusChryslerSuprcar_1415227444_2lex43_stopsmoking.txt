I can't believe I just overcame an Adderall-induced cigarette craving!!!!!

Thowaway because my smoking is a secret that I want to quit without many people knowing about it.

I picked up smoking again after I got my prescription for Adderall in March of this year. Whatever your opinion on the medication, one thing is certain: the use of it greatly increases the risks of becoming addicted to cigarettes.

In all of the months since March, I have **never** been able to conquer a craving for cigarettes. It has caused me to be very depressed and hopeless, but today I did it. I *cannot* believe it, but I feel more proud of myself than I have in a very long time. The feeling lasted for about 15 minutes but then it vanished

I've learned that I **can** overcome my vices. 

I started to worry *what if I have a craving tomorrow when I take my medication?** But I realized that I have to take it a day at a time. I shouldn't worry about tomorrow because the fact that I have proven that I **can** do it today will affect my choice tomorrow.  

**Today** is a victory.

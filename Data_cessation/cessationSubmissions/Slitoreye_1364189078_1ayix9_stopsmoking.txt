Anyone else?

I've quit on and off for some time now but never have been able to quit for good.  For me cigarettes are tough to quit because when I am out, especially the bar scene, going to smoke a cig is almost an anxiety crutch for me.  Whenever I start to feel awkward or need something to do, smoking a cig always relieves that.  I don't crave for a cigarette when sober, only when out and alcohol is involved do I actually get that urge to have one.  To get to the point, was curious if anyone else feels that way and have you tried any other things in situations like those?

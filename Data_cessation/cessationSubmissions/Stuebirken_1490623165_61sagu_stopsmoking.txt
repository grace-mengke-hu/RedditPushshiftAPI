Just found out I'm pregnant, any advice how to stop?

I've smoked since i was 14. Im 36 now,  and  last week I found out that I'm pregnant.

I have to stop of cause,  but it's important that I don't get stressed in the process.

I have already gone from 40 to about 10 cigarettes a day. There's no longer any smoking indoor, and I have a "stop smoking"- hypnosis book,  white a CD (how the hell have a cd-player these days?),  that I'm gonna try.

Have you any tricks, god advice,  ore something els you can tell me,  that can help me to quit quick but (relatively) stress free  ?

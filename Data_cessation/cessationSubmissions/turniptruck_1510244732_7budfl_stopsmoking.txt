In some of my weakest, most vulnerable moments, I feel the craving creep back in.

Its been a hard year. Extreme highs and lows. I'm not going to relapse because I see it for what it is. Just a chemical reaction in my brain that I can either witness and acknowledge or let control me. How I act is my choice.

Thanks for the chance to vent. It's cathartic and gives me strength :)

Stay strong everyone. You got this. Just wait 10min.

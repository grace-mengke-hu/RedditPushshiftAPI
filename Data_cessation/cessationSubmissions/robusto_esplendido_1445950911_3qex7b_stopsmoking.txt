Screwed up and bought a pack after quitting a year and a half ago...

I bought the pack a week and a half ago after a long and particularly rough night at work (as a restaurant server, added for those who are familiar with the culture of smoking in the service industry). I was at the bar with some coworkers, and resisting has always been the hardest when I'm drunk and I just...wasn't thinking.

So it was a drunken mistake, but the next morning I didn't ditch the pack. I figured, what the hell, I'll hold onto it for another day. Repeat every morning for the next week and a half. I've found an excuse to smoke one every day. Half of me believes that I won't buy another after this pack is gone, but the other half of me wonders if I'm deluding myself and I'm really slipping back into the habit/addiction.

My boyfriend, although a smoker himself, is disappointed in me. I'm disappointed in me, too. I'm mostly afraid that this isn't a passing slip-up because one morning I couldn't find my pack and I thought my boyfriend had taken the initiative to discard it for me...and I was furious. But he didn't, I found it, lit up and calmed down. Fuck.

My mind is a battleground between the reasons I quit and the reasons I feel like I depend on cigarettes, even if I know logically that the latter reasons are unfounded.

Anyway, I just wanted to let that out. I feel so...small and weak. Any support would be appreciated.

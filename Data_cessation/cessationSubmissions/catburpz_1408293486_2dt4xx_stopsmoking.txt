Hellooo badges

Hello! I'm new to this sub, but I wanted to join because we get badges! I'm on day three now, and so far I haven't had any problems, with the exception of a small bout of road rage that made me crave.  But I remembered that neurologically the feeling of anger can only last a few seconds, and I was just perpetuating it and giving myself a reason to want to light up.  Anyways I didn't, and I felt really great afterwards and now I figured badges would motivate me even more! 

Okay, that's all, looking forwards to deep breaths and smelling good with all you folks.

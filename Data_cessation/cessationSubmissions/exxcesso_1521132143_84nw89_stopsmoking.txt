Day 1 is in the books!

And Jesus Christ was it tough! Those first few hours were the worst. I almost snapped a few times. My anxiety was through the roof. But I kept reminding myself that all it took was one puff and I would have to start over from zero again. I definitely don’t want to go through that again. So I did a lot of breathing exercises and that seemed to help. Last night I had the hardest time falling asleep, and this morning I woke up coughing. My first trigger came while I was driving to work, and the second one came after I had my coffee. Again I took deep breaths and went for short walks. Day two hasn’t been nearly as bad as day one, and I’m looking forward to gradually feeling better. I am so damn proud of myself! This is a huge accomplishment for me! 😁

I am on my 9th day smoke free. Weight is plummeting.

I decided to quit cold turkey 9 days ago and still haven't had a cigarette. I don't normally have much of an appetite, but since I quit smoking I have NONE. Smoking on an empty stomach made me feel sick so I was always forced to eat a meal. Now I don't have that sickness to make me eat more. I can't even believe I'm saying this because it's ridiculous. Will this go away? Don't most people gain weight?! My bmi is a fucking 14.8. I'm honestly starting to think I should start smoking again. Or do you think this will subside soon? Is it worth waiting it out?!

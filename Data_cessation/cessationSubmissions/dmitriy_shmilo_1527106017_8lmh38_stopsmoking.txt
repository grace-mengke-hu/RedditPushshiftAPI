[Question] How do I become less irritable?

I was addicted to tobacco for about 10-11 years, quit cold turkey, and have been clean for a bit more than 3 years. However, I've become insanely irritable shortly after quitting. A lot of things, which used to be so insignificant before, are now making me Hulk-smash-level angry in a matter of seconds. 

For example, I've become very sensitive to certain smells, like fried garlic or onion. Or certain low-pitched sounds, like my upstairs neighbor noisy walking in the middle of the fucking night. If my colleague makes a dumb mistake or asks a foolish question I can literally (literally) wish them to burn in hell for their incompetence, even though I don't really mean it.

I usually calm down after a minute or less, but in that minute I can do a lot of regretful stuff - I can say hurtful things to somebody who's getting on my nerves, or break some stuff while raging, and even physically hurt myself in the process.

What can I do to become a bit less sensitive? Any advice is greatly appreciated, as long as it doesn't involve pills.

Thanks.

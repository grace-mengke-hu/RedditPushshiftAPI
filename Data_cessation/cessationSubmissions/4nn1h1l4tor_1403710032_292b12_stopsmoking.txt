Really wanna make it happen this time.

I am a 21 year old college student. Today is the day where I want to get this bad habit out of my life. I just need some encouraging words. 

About two months ago I managed to go roughly 6 weeks without smoking (after holidays with my now ex-gf) but slowly started again after she broke up with me. First time I had a cig afterwards was just awful but then I had gotten back used to it very quickly. Partly because of friends, partly because of a lack of willpower.
Now, here is the issue. I started smoking when I was roughly 17 years old but kept it to the weekends when I would be drinking/clubbing with friends. It got worse as I started studying but:  
I had always managed to keep it to ~5 a day.  
This comes with the issue that you constantly tell yourself "oh its not so much, its not as bad" and that the money side of things is not a big aspect (especially since I have never had any problems with that in the first place) which made quitting for the money an irrelevant motivation.  
As for sports, I do competitive target archery which means that cardiovascular endurance is not as important as in other sports. I have started running regularly just recently and have already noticed an improvement in my endurance - the impact of smoking is definitely noteworthy there though. 
Long story short, I know that smoking is bad, I do want to quit, I know that it is only gonna get worse, yet my motivation to stop RIGHT NOW is abysmal. Help, please.

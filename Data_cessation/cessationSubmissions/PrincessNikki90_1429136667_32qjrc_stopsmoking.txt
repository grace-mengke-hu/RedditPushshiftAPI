So I'm in need of a little help please :)

Hello everyone! Hopefully y'all will be able to help me out. My boyfriend has made the decision to quit smoking. Im incredibly proud of him and I want to be as much help to him as I can. He decided to quit just a couple days ago, but broke down and had one this afternoon. He's really torn up about it, I told him it's nothing to be ashamed of, it's just part of the battle. 
But I was wondering if you guys would have any words of encouragement for him, maybe some tips or any advice, just something to help him get back on track. I really appreciate it :)

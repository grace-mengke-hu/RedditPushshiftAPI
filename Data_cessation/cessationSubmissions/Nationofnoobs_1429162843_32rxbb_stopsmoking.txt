I have quit smoking and have no desire to go back!

Hi people! I want to share my experience of quitting smoking, and maybe others will back able to do it the same way I have. 

I have been cigarette free for 14 days now minus one cigarette I had yesterday but I will explain that in a little later. I'm 22 and I have been a pack a day smoker since I was 16. 

So, how did I quit? I stopped smoking because I bought a good quality VAPE! I bought an IPV 3 box mod, aspire alantis tank, and some 24mg nicotine juice. 

I immediately hated Vaping, because I was inhaling vapor and not smoke, I would cough a lot. However, the cough goes away after a day or so. 

Anyways, on day 5 of Vaping I ran out of juice so I went to the store and dropped down to 18mg nicotine juice, I vaped on that until I ran out. 

3 days ago, I dropped down again to 12mg nicotine juice, I have effectively halved the normal amount of nicotine I've been getting in two weeks! But, I found an old pack of cigarettes yesterday, the pack only had 1 cigarette left and I figured I would smoke it to see if I missed it. I lit it up, took one puff, and immediately put it out. The taste was dreadful. I don't understand how I was able to smoke those! 

I am able to breathe much better, my smokers cough has pretty much gone away, and I'm no longer worried if I smell like cigarettes anymore! 

So, please, if you're serious about quitting smoking, invest in a Vape. They will help you! If you have any questions about vaping, feel free to ask! 

TL;DR: I stopped smoking cigarettes by switching to Vaping and I am slowly reducing the nicotine I'm ingesting by buying juice with lower concentrations of nicotine

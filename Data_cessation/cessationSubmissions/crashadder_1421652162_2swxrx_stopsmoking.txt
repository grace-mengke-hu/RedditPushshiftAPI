best week of my life

like the badge says its been 2 months. Last week i had to attend a technical training in my former office. I've been recently assigned to a different role so had been relocated to a different office. I have really good friends in that office whom i smoked with every half an hour for the last five years. When i organized this training it never occurred to me all the strong triggers i would have to encounter revisiting old friends. come to think about it. smoker friends, boring training, coffee breaks, lunch with friends and worst part (or should i say the best ) i had to drive to and from the office instead of taking the shuttle. From an ex-smoker point of view, it just couldn't get any more difficult than that. However turns out i was so wrong. I had more fun than ever. The training was dead boring yeah but i never wanted to smoke. instead sat in the room for hours without a break. new quitters might still find this hard to believe. trust me it is real. you'll begin to see smoking as a burden not the icing on the cake. It is just one more thing to do to feel OK. Sad really. honestly the first day was somewhat bothersome. but once through it all went downhill from there. I guess last week was an important milestone for my unlearning process. It had every sort of associations. I would like to thank /u/Armison for clarifying the associations so clearly. It sure helps a lot. I'll keep sharing my experiences in the hope that someone might find it useful.
peace.

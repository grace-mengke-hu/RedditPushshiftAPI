Not quite there, but a huge step

I've been a long time lurker here, waiting for the the right time to quit (despite all the posts saying there is never a right time). I've taken a huge step towards quitting, so I thought I'd share. 
Last week I bought a vape and some vanilla nicsalts. The change was instant. In the past week I smoked 2 real cigarettes. Right at the beginning I had one, and the next day I tried 1 and felt completely grossed out. Which was an awesome and exciting surprise.
It's not a true quit, but I have a plan for myself to gradually reduce the nicotine levels and completely break this habit! Can't wait to save over $200 a month, and do fun stuff with that money! So while I'm not quite there yet, I'm super proud of this step!

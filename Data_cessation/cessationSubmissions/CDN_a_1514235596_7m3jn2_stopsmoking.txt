Gearing up... I know it's such a cliche... but just coincides with New Year.

Gearing up psychologically to try again! I know I have to have my little last blast then.. give quitting a darn good try. Going to actually go to AA this time, because I've found drinking to be my downfall every time I try to quit. So it shouldn't be a big deal to give up booze, weed et al for a few years...? Anyway.. never drank for 15 years when I was younger. What does anybody think?

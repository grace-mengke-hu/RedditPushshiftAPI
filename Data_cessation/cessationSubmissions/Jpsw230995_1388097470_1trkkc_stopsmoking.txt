Day 17: Really Anxious

So I stopped smoking because of my family and friends and before that I had a sore throat so that gave me even more reason to quit. Anyway, I've had the sore throat ever since and whenever it feels like its going away it comes back with a vengeance. It hurts mostly when I stretch the back of my throat and swallowing can be strenuous. It's really making me nervous, when is this supposed to go away?

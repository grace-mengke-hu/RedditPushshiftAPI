Day 16 Cold Turkey going strong

My last update was day 13...
3 days later I have had a few up's and downs but still going strong. When I first saw people were getting depressed I was like "get over it wimp" (to myself). Why would anyone be depressed over quitting smoking? Well yesterday I was the wimp and thanks to those posts they helped me get over it because I now knew it was normal. I guess that is part of the detox process. I know there will be plenty of more unexpected moments to come so I have to be ready for battle. I fell so good and proud of myself for winning the little fights. The cravings are getting much easier to deal with and less frequent.
I have to keep reminding myself of the positives of being a non-smoker not the negatives.
Thank you for everyone's posts they help!

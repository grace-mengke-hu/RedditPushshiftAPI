Feeling angry - I quit, spouse didnt

So I smoked for 38 years then quit 1 year and 3 months ago. My husband quit at the same time but he only lasted 7 months and started back again. On the positive side, he's no longer smoking inside but I still smell it when the windows are open it I go out either door. I'm sort of angry in that he is happy again and enjoying life and I'm miserable and feeling angry right now. I've gained 18 lbs since quitting too. Despite not having any nicotine in my system since April 3, 2015 I still have cravings that my no-nic vape isn't filling.  Any ideas?

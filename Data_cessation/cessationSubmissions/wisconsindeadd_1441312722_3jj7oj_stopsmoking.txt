Drinking and Smoking - Is it possible to quit one without the other?

Nearly every single one of my friends drinks and smokes regularly. Hence when we hang out its a steady combination of both. Has anyone hear been able to keep drinking/partying while quitting smoking? I just feel like if I'm going to quit, I'm basically going to have to hang out with no one for a month or so. Which sounds rather boring...

Making it through the morning

I'm attempting to quit smoking and this morning (about 24hrs in) was brutal. Coffee isn't even the same haha. I spent all day in class 10-2:50) which helped distract me, eventually. However, it still was rough from about 9am until 1pm. Any tips on how to make the mornings easier???

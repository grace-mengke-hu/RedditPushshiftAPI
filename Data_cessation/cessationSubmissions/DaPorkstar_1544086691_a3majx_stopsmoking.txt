When will I stop wanting to smoke?

Little back story. 

I smoked for 3 years pretty regularly, granted it wasn’t actual cigarettes the whole time but I smoked it with weed. 

I then stopped smoking weed. Only smoked cigarettes for about a year, dropped that, and bought a vape. 

I vaped for a solid 2 years. My girlfriend always found it very unattractive so I sold it and quit cold turkey, (semi resentfully lol). I initially found quitting to be relatively easy, besides the fact Its so integrated into my life, such as wanting to hit my vape while having coffee, or drinking etc. 

Anyway, I’ve recently started a new job and all my co-workers smoke or vape, it’s certainly kick started the addiction and I’m having a very hard time saying no. I’ve smoked a few of my co workers cigarettes recently (behind SO back) and occasionally hit my co workers vape. It’s definitely something I know I need to stop but it’s so hard when there’s triggers all around. When will I finally be able to just say “no.” Without second guessing it?

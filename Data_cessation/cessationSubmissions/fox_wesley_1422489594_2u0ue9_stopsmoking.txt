Embarrassed, and quitting today...

Hey everyone;

I've always enjoyed smoking for the social aspect (and obviously the addictive chemicals), but today at work, someone said something that changed how I see cigarettes, and I decided within 5 minutes that I was going to quit cold turkey. 

What happened you ask?

I went to a meeting at work today 20-30 min after smoking, sat down next to one of my coworkers, who immediately remarked, "Just come from smoking?"  "Kinda, how could you tell?" I replied. "Oh, every time I sit next to you I feel like I just smoked a pack."

It wasn't malicious, and I played it off, but I was very embarrassed. I guess I had always assumed that since I never smoke inside, the smell wasn't that bad and wore off pretty quickly. I remember as a kid being able to tell immediately if someone smokes, and wanting to avoid them, but I never thought that would happen if I didn't smoke inside. I've been concerned for my health for a while now, but knowing that everyone smells it on me as soon as I walk through the door was a bit of a wake up call. I'm quitting cold-turkey, and just got my badge. 

Wish me luck!

Should I go get an e-cig? About 4 hours into day 1, and this sucks!

I had my last one shortly after midnight last night, and decided this is the year I'm done.  I have quit at least a dozen times over the last 12 years (I'm 32), and I'm sick of smelling like an ashtray, sick of the constant bad breath, sick of going outside in the cold every couple of hours, sick of waking up congested and having a sore throat, and sick of spending 6-8 bucks every 2 days.  

I think I'm dedicated, but man, does this suck...like a lot.  I'm debating going up to the gas station for an e-cig, have you guys found that this helps, or should I just man-up and deal with withdrawal?

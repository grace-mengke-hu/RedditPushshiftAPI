Honest Allan Carr review.

I've spent my last 2 quits counting minutes.. hours... since my last cigarette.

Showing myself how healthy I was getting, etc etc.

I quit last night at... like.. 3 AM? I haven't looked at my quit apps at all today. I'm just a non-smoker now. That's it. Simply.

Why haven't you gotten it yet? I'm curious, if you haven't.

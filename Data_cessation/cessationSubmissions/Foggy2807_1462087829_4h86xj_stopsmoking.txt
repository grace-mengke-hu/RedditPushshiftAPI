Day 13 - Still stopped

I have just woke up to a notification on my smoke free app, 305 hours i have been quit for ðŸ˜Š. I started on champix to help stop which it did; however the second lot started to make me feel depressed; so i stopped them and that is when I realised i didnt need them to quit! I have gone a whole week without (plcaebo effect?!) i would say to anyone stopping, everytime you have a craving eat a piece of fruit it has helped me through - other techniques as well if you want to know just ask ðŸ˜Š

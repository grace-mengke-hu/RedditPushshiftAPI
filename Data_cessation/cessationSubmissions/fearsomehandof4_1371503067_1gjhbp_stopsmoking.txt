Day One

Well folks, today is my first day smoke free in many years. This is my second attempt to quit in ten years of being a smoker. All this week, I've been waking up in the middle of the night, short of breath and struggling for air. It's a terrible, helpless, panic feeling, and I know that if I don't quit this habit now, that's likely how my eventual death is going to feel. Talk about a wake up call.

In a few months, I'm going to be 30 years old, and before that day comes, I intend to be an ex-smoker and keep it that way. The Reddit community is an amazing force, and I'm hoping that by subscribing to this sub, I can harness some of that power to help me with this very difficult task ahead. I thank you all in advance for your support as I journey to eliminate cigarettes from my life once and for all.

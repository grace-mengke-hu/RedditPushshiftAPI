WOOOOHOOOOO!!!!!! 50 DAYS!!! New Year non smoker unite!

HELL YEAH! 50 days kids! This is how we do it. 

This is by far the longest I went without smoking. I am done with it. Never will I smoke again. I am really hoping most of you 50 days non smokers are still with us here. 

To those of you who are on your day 5, week 1 or whatever, just stick with it. Believe me, it is soooo worth it to be not smoker. 

I feel like a million fucking bucks!

Lets do the 100 days! BOOM!

10 more days until new badge!

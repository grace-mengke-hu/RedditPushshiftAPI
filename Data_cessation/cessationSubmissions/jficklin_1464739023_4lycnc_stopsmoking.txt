2 Weeks No Nicotine

This is the longest I've gone without Nicotine in body since I was 16-17 years old. I'm now 27. I've quit longer before, but always with Nicotine replacements (which always ended with me smoking again). 

Feels pretty damn good I've got to say. Avoided a number of opportunities to slip up this past weekend as well. Was able to say no and move along pretty easily (while drinking). Not bad at all!

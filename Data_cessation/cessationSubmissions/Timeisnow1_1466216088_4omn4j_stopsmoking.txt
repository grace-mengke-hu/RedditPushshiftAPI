150 Days I celebrated by....

Running 4 miles.  Something I couldn't have done  a few months ago.  I smoked 15 years over a pack a day.  Never thought I would be able to run again.   It has really helped me stay quit, giving me a way to relieve stress and got me competitive with my self.   I feel beter than I have in a long time.

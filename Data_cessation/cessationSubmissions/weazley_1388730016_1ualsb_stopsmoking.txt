Still is so hard

I'm not going to lie - and sorry all you new quitters - but I'm sitting here a year and a half after I quit smoking and it hurts. I want one. No-one I know is around me. Im drinking because it's the only thing that stops me smoking and I want one. I'm at a bar and everyone around me is smoking and although sometimes it smells so disgusting I want to throw myself off a building... other times I want one so bad I would throw myself off a building to get one. 

I know it will kill me if I take it up again. I know it will hurt me and all the ones I love if I take it up again. I know it won't solve anything if I take it up again. But I want one. I don't want any sympathy. I don't want any help. I just want it to go away. Days like this I feel right back to my first day. And my 30th. And my 3 months and my one year. It sucks man. It fucking sucks. Fuck you cigarettes for controlling me like this.

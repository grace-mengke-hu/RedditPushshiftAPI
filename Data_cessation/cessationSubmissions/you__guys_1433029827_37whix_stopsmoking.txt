Just found my boyfriend (who quit a week ago) has been leaving the house during the day to go smoke and I could use some advice on what to do/how to react.

It was his choice to quit, and I made sure tell him that if he wants to start smoking again â€” that's also his choice. I also told him that the last thing I want him to do is lie and go behind my back about it, which he obviously did and now I don't know how to proceed.

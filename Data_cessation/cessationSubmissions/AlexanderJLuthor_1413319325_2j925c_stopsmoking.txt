Veteran of the Army now a veteran of smoking

Well, it has been a total of 205.66 hours since I had my last cigarette and I as a result of searching online about "quitter's flu" I wound up here. It is nice to see a community like this. Can't wait to see my badge read 365. I look forward to getting some much needed support. Thanks to whoever set this up! 

All the best, 

Lex

4 Weeks, but...

I am a teacher and today marked the first day of back to school meetings. I made sure to quit early enough in the summer to have a month in before the students get back, but I forgot how much of a habit it is for me to smoke after a day at work. I made it through today without a cigarette and plan to stay strong, but the craving was there. I just needed this out there for me to refocus myself. Thanks for all the support. This sub has been a huge help.

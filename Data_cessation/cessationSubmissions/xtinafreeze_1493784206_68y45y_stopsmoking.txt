Day 143

Never thought I would make it this far.  One thing that keeps me from lighting up again is the thought of quitting again. Quitting smoking was one of the hardest things I have ever done. I smoked over half a pack a day for 20 years. I remember that first day. It was like staring down a dark tunnel. I never thought I would reach the other side. I didn't know that I could have a life without smoking. I'm just writing to let anyone who may read this who is on day 1 that it does get easier and you can definitely reach the end.

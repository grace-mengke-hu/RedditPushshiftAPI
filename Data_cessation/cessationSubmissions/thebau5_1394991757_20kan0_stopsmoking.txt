Today is the day i quit

I have been smoking since I was 16, i'm now 27 years old and one month away from being a father. I have read Carrs book and been through hypnotherapy. Neither really sunk in for me. I just had my last smoke. I can't keep disappointing myself and family. I'm going to need help from you all for those extra irritating days. Any words of advice for the first three days?

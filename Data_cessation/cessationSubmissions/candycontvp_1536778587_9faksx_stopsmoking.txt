I'm so irritable and feel miserable, what else can I do?

It's been nearly three days since my last smoke. I'm wearing the 21mg patch, working out, eating suuuuuuuper healthy, but I just feel miserable. I can barely function, I need to work and can't concentrate. 

It's not that I'm idolizing cigarettes, because i know that if I smoke I'm gonna feel super guilty. But f***k I just feel like a very bitter version of myself. I'm irritable, angry, resented. 

I don't know what to do to feel better. I'm trying to accept my misery at the moment, hoping that soon the sun will shine again. But there's not even like a set day when this happy morning will come. 

I take xanax to sleep, 0.5mg before bedtime, but not even xanax is helping me sleep well. I keep having nightmares and wake up at all hours of the night wanting to smoke. 

I'm also reading Allen Carr's book for the third time.

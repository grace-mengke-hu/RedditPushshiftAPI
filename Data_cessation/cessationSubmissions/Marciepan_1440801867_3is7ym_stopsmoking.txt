Losing Motivation...anyone else?

So now that I'm coming upon three weeks of being a non smoker, I found I'm dealing with some new struggles. About two days ago I started  feeling really depressed, and then suddenly very little motivation to do anything but sleep. When I first quit, I was filled with energy and ambition and was really excited about all the things I could do with my new healthy smoke free life (after the first three days of being a crazy crying psycho that is). Now I just feel sad. Any advice? Did anyone else feel this way after they quit?

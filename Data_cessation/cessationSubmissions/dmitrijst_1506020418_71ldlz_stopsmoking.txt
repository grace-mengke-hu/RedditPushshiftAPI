Is it only me?

I'm on day 12th. Started to smoke at 14 and used to smoke around 15cigs a day. I'm 22 now. Everybody is complaining about mental withdrawals but the thing I feel the most is physical withdrawals. Each day it's something different. Yesterday, I had a sore throat, my back  hurt or smth inside it, today it's my shoulders. I've got slightly higher temperature. They pain is not bad though, but i feel it from time to time, maybe my anxiety contributes to all that, who knows. I just can't find people who had physical withdrawals for that long and so many different. I can't be the only one, guys where are you???

Uhm need help with lung heavyness

I tried to quit in mid-September because I started to have anxiety problems and made it until about a week ago, but I only smoked one cigarette. I've been reading that this might be normal, but if someone can walk me through this shit, that would be great. E

Every so often for the past month or so- my lungs will start to feel heavy. Today, while in the store, my lungs, almost straight out of nowhere started feeling really heavy, and still feels that way. Will this go away? Is this related to me quitting or should I see a doctor for a different thing maybe?

I'm 18
I smoked for a bit over a year
I tried vaping on 2 separate days-but it gave me alot of anxiety so I dont use my vape.

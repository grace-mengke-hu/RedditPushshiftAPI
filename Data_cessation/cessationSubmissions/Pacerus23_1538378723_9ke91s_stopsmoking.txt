7 Days Smoke Free. I don't want to quite ever again.

This is not the first time I have gone this long without smoking. Smoked a pack a day for the last 13 years.

Have had many failed attempts in the last 5 years. My last attempt lasted the whole month of May 2018. Went back to a pack a day within week of slipping up. Did not have a strong craving till the day I relapsed.

7 days no real strong cravings. The pattern is the same.

I am afraid that when the strong craving comes I will cave again. 

Any advice on how to deal with this fear that when I finally have strong urge I will fail.

Difficulty concentrating on things I need to get done.

Hey guys. I've been lurking on this subreddit for like 3 months now, reading all the tips, insights and positive affirmations you all share with each other as I've been trying to quit for a while now. I hate smoking, I absolutely HATE it. I find myself out of breath just climbing up four flights of stairs and I smell like crap almost all the time except the half hour after a shower. I really do want to quit.

I've tried to quit 4 times in the past 7 weeks. The longest I've ever managed so far is 3 days. Last year, the longest I'd managed was 3 months and 16 days, after which I relapsed during a period of stress. The problem I'm facing now is that I have a challenging course load, being in Senior year in college, and everytime I try to quit, I can't concentrate on my work for shit. I feel more energetic and motivated to get work done, but when I sit down to get to it, I end up zoning out or getting distracted by other things and cravings. This leads me to eventually cave and get a smoke, after which I can work fine, but I feel like crap.

I hate having to depend on slow suicide to do the same work that non-smokers can do just fine. I don't want to depend on cigs to function at my best. If any of you faced similar problems while quitting, what did you do to over come them and help you focus on the work at hand?

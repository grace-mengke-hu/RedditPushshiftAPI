10m 7d 11h Since I've Quit

The app I've downloaded "Smokefree" was amazing in the first few days at giving me something to look to whenever I had the urge to grab a smoke. Give it a try and start that timer. 

The biggest and best thing about being a non smoker I've learned over the last few months is the Quality of life, it becomes so much better in every little way. I don't feel powerless and weak anymore just wanting to quit and being unable to handle life without cigs. 

There are a million benefits and it gets easier after day 1. that first 24 hours when you make a choice.

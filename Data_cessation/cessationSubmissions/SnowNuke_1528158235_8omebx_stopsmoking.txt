Want to finish off the summer without coughing my lungs up anymore.

I'm 19 and have been smoking regularly for 3 years. Smoke both weed and tobacco and it's killed me on the inside. Dropped out of college cause I preferred getting high to anything else. Always having to go outside for smoke breaks. Being sick more than usual. Smelling like shit. 


I've finally had enough. Today is the start of a healthy, smoke free life. Big thanks to everyone is this sub for sharing. You've all been a big influence.

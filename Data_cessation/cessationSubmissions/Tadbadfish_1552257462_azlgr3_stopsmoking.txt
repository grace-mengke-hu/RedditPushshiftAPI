Day 145

Today is day 145 for me. Is it normal to still have intense cravings at this point? I smoked for about 12 years, half a pack to a full pack per day. 29 year old female. Starting to wonder if it is too ingrained to keep away from for forever, but I know I never want to go through that first week of cold turkey again, ever.

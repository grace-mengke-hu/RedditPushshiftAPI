1 Month no Cigs, 2 Days no nicotine. This is hard. Emotional.

I switched to a JUUL last month and it was amazing. Could not believe I could replace cigarettes! I was a pack a day smoker for the past 7 years... Now I decided to cut out the JUUL...this is hard 

The first two days I was in the most horrible mood ever. Everything pissed me off. Today I just want to cry. I “miss” nicotine. How great it went with everything. Caffeine, working, pot, drinking, after a meal. I’m having a hard time seeing the light at the end of the tunnel.

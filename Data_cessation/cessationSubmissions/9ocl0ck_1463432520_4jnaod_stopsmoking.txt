I'm really mad at my brain right now.

It helps my resolve to filter all this anxiety through anger, so here goes.

What bullshit it is that I'm sitting here, with 90 hours since my last cigarette, thinking about "just one"? Addict Brain is fully willing to relive the last four days of anxiety, rage, tears, and tension for one more. Addict Brain is a fucking jerk. I don't want to go through this shit again! I haven't made it this long with no nicotine whatsoever since 2012! I should be proud and happy but Addict Brain isn't letting me derive pleasure from anything.

If I could change one thing in my life I would have never picked up that first cigarette. I don't even have to think twice about it, that's absolutely the one thing I would change. So why do I feel like it's something I like doing, something I should miss? It's not and it hasn't been for a long time.

I'm mad that I'm struggling with quitting even after watching people I love die of horrible lung diseases, like some vile selfish short-sighted idiot brat that can't learn from the suffering of others or deal with anything short of instant gratification. I'm mad that I was ever so stupid to start doing this in the first place. I'm mad that I have to go to work tomorrow and try not to explode on customers all day. I'm not going to be surprised if I get my ass fired this week in a nicotine deprived tantrum, I'm more irritable than I've ever been in my life and I haven't even had to work since I stopped. I'm mad that there's never going to be a perfect time to stop. I'm mad that I miss something that makes me suffer. I'm mad that I have a compulsive urge to line the pockets of the immoral fucks who push tobacco.

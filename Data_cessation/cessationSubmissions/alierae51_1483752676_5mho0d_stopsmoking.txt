Any advice would be appreciated

I am on day 5, using patches, my husband smokes, but the smell doesn't bother me at all.   I have an e-cigarette with 0 nicotine for backup but have barely used it.  Most of my cravings are just habit thoughts.   I have several triggers,  the worst is food, which is starting to taste amazing.  I keep having thoughts of just one cigarette,  but the fear of failure stops me.   I've failed several times.   It is hard to think of myself as a non-smoker.

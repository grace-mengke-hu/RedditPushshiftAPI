How to Prepare for the Worst

I made an attempt recently to quit smoking and I failed after less than 48 hours. The truth is that I still believe to this day that cigarette is my friend and it relaxes me and it is there when I always need it.

But the real reason I want to quit smoking is that I can't afford buying cigarettes anymore. I really like smoking unfortunately. But I have to quit someday and I don't want that day to be when I am in some sort of late stage cancer.

But in order to succeed and become an ex smoker I need your help. I have connected many things of my daily life with picking a cigarette. When I wake up with my coffee, when I arrive at work, when I get a break at work, when I arrive home after a long day and some cigarettes before I go to bed.

I want to clear my mind with the idea that I miss something and being nervous about it. I want to stop thinking of it. Just please give me your tips. Any tips. How did you succeed?

Thanks in advance.

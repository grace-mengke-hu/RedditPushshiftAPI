Family time and 28 days tomorrow..

Hi y'all! 

Just got in from spending some time with my family (and in-laws). The stress, the tension, the emotional digs, the criticism.. It's only been in my interactions with them in the past week that I've had cravings at all. Family.. 

This is when, coming home after all that, I would be itching to "destress" with a smoke. If I had some here, which I would if I hadn't quit for real instead of "keeping them for emergencies", that would've been my excuse to pick back up. If I didn't have over 20 days under my belt, I might have the urge to go get some. 

But... I don't! I'm here relaxing with netflix, and should be going to bed soon and waking up with another day on the badge. Feels good. Just posting here to affirm that!

Hope you're all having a nice evening. Thanks for everything. Keep at it!

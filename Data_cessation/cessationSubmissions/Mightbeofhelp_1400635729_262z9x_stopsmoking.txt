Feeling low after losing a years progress.

Stupidly had a cigarette the other day while drunk, then another and I suppose you can see how this goes. Had another one earlier and hate myself still. Really want to get rid of this horrid stuff once and for all.

Did anyone else relapse after a year? How did you deal with it?

When will the coughing begin?

Hi everyone! 

Today is my 10th day of not smoking, after reading Allen Car's book and using 0mg vape. Until now it hasn't been extremely difficult, except for diner last weekend with my in-laws. But much easier than one and a half year ago when I quit for 2.5 weeks. When I was quiting back then, I had lots of psyhical withdrawal pangs like being cold all day and having a huge appetite. Another thing I remembered was the fact that I was coughing up a lot. And my sputum was full of black things (I think tar?). Up until today I didn't cough one time. So my question is:

When will the coughing begin normally? And is it normal to have sputum with black things in it?

Good luck everyone fighting the little nicotine-monster!

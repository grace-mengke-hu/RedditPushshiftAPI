Working on Day 3 right now, using patches/lozenges

Could anyone give me some experience on when this NEED for a cigarette will die down?  I thought the patches and lozenges would help more.  Dont get me wrong, they are helping, but i have this constant nagging "need" for a cigarette.  Not so much nicotine, but the act of smoking itself.  (or whatever else they are hiding in cigarettes)

Do these feelings start to edge off after 4-5 days or what?  Seems like i cannot go 20 seconds without wanting a cigarette

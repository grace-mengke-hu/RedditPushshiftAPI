I'm 19 years old and have been smoking for two years. I keep telling myself that by the time I develop cancer or some other cigarette caused illness, that medical technology will be able to cure it by then. Fuck that. I'm sick of making excuses. DAY ONE BEGINS NOW!!!!!!!

You guys are fucking inspiring. Only someone who has smoked before knows how incredibly hard it is to quit. I hate that I will forever have the urge to smoke, but I have to start sometime. Also I'm a broke ass college student so I can't wait for that cigg money to start pouring in.

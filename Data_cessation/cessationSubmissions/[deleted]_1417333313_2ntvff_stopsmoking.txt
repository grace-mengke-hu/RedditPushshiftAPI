2 days down and I don't even want a cigarette.

I've been smoking since I was 17. Now I'm 23. Of course it wasn't like it is now. At 17 I would only smoke 1, maybe 2 a day. And it stayed like that until I was about 21, when I asked my wife if I could start smoking when I was drinking(she was always against it, but always caves to me, which is awesome but horrible in this case). 

From that point forward I had started smoking way more regularly. Maybe every hour to two hours. To the point I was going through a pack within a day and a half. Ever since then I knew I had to stop! to the point where I would tell myself this is my last pack every time, only to buy another pack as soon as I smoked my last cigarette. 

This is how you can tell I've always wanted to quit! I've always had enough money to buy a carton but I never did! Even though it would have probably saved my many hundreds of dollars!

Now here I am at the end of 2014. Sick as a dog. Feel like crap from head to toe, but I also feel better than I have in a while about myself. I usually smoke when I'm sick(so painful but i've done it many times). THIS TIME I'M DONE!!! I've gone a full 2 days without smoking going on 3 days!!! and I never want to smoke again!!! 

I'm looking for support from others. Anything at all will help. Encouraging words. Stories of yourself. I don't think I can get it anywhere else, cause I don't know a single person who has smoked and quit. And my wife just gives me the "good job honey i'm proud of you" and then we move on with our day. I need more than that, because I've had that for years! Thank you to all who read this and I'll help where I can in the community as well.

Fuck it. I just finished a pack and I'm broke. Lets just be done with this crap.

I've been thinking of quitting for a while. Started smoking when I was 13, and I'm almost twenty now. For the last couple of years I've been on about two packs a day. No idea where I got the money for it, but pretty much all I had I spent on cigarettes.

A few months back I gave quitting a go. Made it three weeks, then relapsed. I've only been on about 10 a day since, but still. I'm done. Never again.

So... What now? What do I do, if the cravings get too much? I really don't feel like switching to patches or gum or anything. I'd really like to just quit it all and be done with it.

I'd really appreciate some advice

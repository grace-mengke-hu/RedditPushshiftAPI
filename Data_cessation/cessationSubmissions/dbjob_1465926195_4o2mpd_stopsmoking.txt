Day 4 - It's hard.

I've quitted a couple of times without any success because it was too easy so I was sure that I would be the one that could only smoke the odd cigarette. So yeah, had a couple of relapses after a month or more of no smoking.

This time, I'm on day 4. My back hurts, I cough all the time, I'm sneezing non-stop and I need to blow my nose every couple of minutes.

I do not feel like having another cigarette, I don't get much cravings, but these cold symptoms are killing me, I want them to stop and it scares me that It might not be linking to my withdrawal symptoms at all.

Anyway, juste wanted to share and if somebody could confort me.

Does it get harder in the summer?

Hey everyone,

I haven't had one cigarette in a little over 3 months now. I'm past the point of excruciating cravings and now I just think about how it would be nice to have on every now and then. I actually noticed I don't even think about smoking after I eat a meal now. When I do think about smoking, the thoughts go away pretty quickly.


Anyway, I live in Chicago, so this question might only apply to those who live in climates where it's cold and miserable in the winter. I was imagining a warm summer night on my porch/a 4th of July backyard BBQ/etc. and realized it may become difficult to cope again during "smoking weather." Did anyone go through this?


I really hope it isn't any harder than the winter has been!

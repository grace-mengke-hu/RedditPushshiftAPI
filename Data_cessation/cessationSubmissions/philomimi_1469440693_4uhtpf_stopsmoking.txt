Is the first three months really the hardest?

I'm reaching at my two months withdrawal from smoking. I felt it kinda challenging at some times with the urges or smoking very strong. Luckily I could cope it with savoury and salty snacks.

I told my friend about this and he said it will be the hardest for the first three months. Afterwards, it will be easy just to ignore the temptation, needs, or anything you call it.

So, besides all that temptation and craving, I usually had this vivid dream of smoking. Like the one you felt guilty while doing, but it's apparently a dream. So, will these kinds of challenges over within three months or it will probably a lifetime process as you had the memory of tasting-good cigarette as you have before for quite sometimes?

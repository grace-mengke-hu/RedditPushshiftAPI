just made it to a week, quick question...

I assume having smoked since i was 15 (now 29) and finally quitting, i should expect some less than enjoyable results...  My throat and nasal cavity have been rather raw, and im seeing a small amount of blood when blowing my nose - can i assume this is normal considering how much crap im coughing and sneezing up?     Mind you im not coughing any blood up, its definitely comming from my nasal cavity.

also if you have trouble dealing iwth the withdrawls, vaping it what got me to today, and without much trouble.

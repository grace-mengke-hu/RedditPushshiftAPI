They say carvings last for about 15 minutes but i feel it's a constant carving

Hey r/stopsmoking yesterday i decided that after 7 years i was gonna quit. I'm 20 years old, i smoke since I'm 13 and that has done so much damage in my body, i know it even though it's not visible, I'm sure it has affected my growth (lack of body hair, late growth and I'm shorter than my friends). I have been free from smoke for 15 hours (9 hours sleeping) but it's been a bad day, i was nervous the whole day and i felt a constant carving, i just lapsed i couldn't resist. The advice that has been given to me is: 3 cigs a day for 3 days, two cigs a day for 2 days, 1 cig for one day then quit. I don't know if that will work, i just know that completely cut the nicotine is a real pain for me and for who's around me because of my nervousness... What advice do you give me?

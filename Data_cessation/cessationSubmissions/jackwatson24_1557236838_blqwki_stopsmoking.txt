I need help.

I (25M) want/need to quit smoking but every time I try to or even think about it, I smoke more. I’ve been smoking since I was in primary school, and I’m just getting worse. 
It’s not just me, my partner (25F) is a smoker too, shes not so bad, when away from me she can smoke as little as 2 a day but smokes so much more hen we’re together. 
I feel awful for this and I just really want to get my shit together.

My fifth or sixth time trying. Really fed up.

I feel like I am weak willed and can't stop. In fact I am smoking more than ever. Drinking more too. This is really depressing me. It's so pathetic but I'm trying again now. I left a half pack in the pub and went home early. I'm not going to smoke this week and to help me I'm going to not drink either. 
Chewing gum, inhalers, patches never seem to work for me. I'll use any excuse to start again but I know it's killing me.
 My younger brother had throat cancer. His still alive. He's lucky. Yet I smoke. It's pathetic. Stupid.
 I've asked before but I need encouragement. Anything will help. 
Thanks for listening.

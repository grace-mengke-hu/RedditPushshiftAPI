1 Day 18 hours in, strangely this is more easy than I thought...

22 Y/O, started smoking at 18 Y/O approximately 12 cigs/day.

I smoked my last cigarette on 30.01.2019 at 00:00 then threw everything I had related to smoking in the trash (cigarettes, lighters, ecigs, vape juiceâ€¦).

Today is the second day I stopped smoking and my workday went pretty good, my smoking partner is in holidays so I'm not tempted to go outside smoking with him, instead I'm staying indoors and creating new habits (going to eat a croissant at the little shop we have at work, working 5 hours straight without taking a smoke break, etc...).

It's not much but its the first time I don't smoke or vape for so long. I have never been so determined to stop smoking. This time is the time.

I sometimes have the urge to smoke but it's still manageable, when it comes up, I check my smoking apps on my phone, navigate this subreddit, eat, take a walk, etc...

My only fear is to see that urge become unmanageable. Everytime I realize I'm thinking subconsciously about how good a cigarette would be, I have to "manually" tell my brain to think about another thing. Other than that, it's going great, much easier than I thought.

Just have one question:

To people that have +100days cigarette free or think they can answer:

How much time do you think it took you to stop craving cigarettes, does that urge to smoke ever goes off?

Thank you for reading.

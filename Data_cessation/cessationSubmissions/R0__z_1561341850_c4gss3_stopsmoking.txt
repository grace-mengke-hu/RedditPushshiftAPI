Almost 2 months, but still tempted

I quit smoking on April 25th, 2019 because I had a  cold sore. I’m 22 y/old and have multiple health issues, so I’m always overly concerned when something else goes wrong. Yes, even as little and as common as a cold sold. Thankfully, focusing and worrying so much on my (quite severe) cold sore is what finally pushed me to quit. I was a smoker for 3 -almost 4- years, so I typically remedied my anxiety by smoking cigarettes. I figured smoking couldn’t heal my lip faster, especially considering the proximity of each cigarette to the cold sore itself.

Anyway, to the point, I was really tempted to smoke this evening. I suddenly became anxious just sitting in my bedroom seemingly for no reason whatsoever. My first thought was, “smoke so it’ll take the edge off.” I really wanted to. Even knowing that I’m closing in on my 2-month date. Instead of smoking, I walked myself into the bathroom, stared at my reflection for 3 minutes, and decided to floss instead. It felt surprisingly good to just acknowledge that I had the opportunity to smoke and be immediately gratified, but instead I chose to replace a negative habit with a positive habit. It felt good. Here’s to 2 more months of no smoking.


TLDR; Quit cigarettes nearly 2 months ago, came close to smoking again today because of my anxiety, but flossed instead. Feels good.

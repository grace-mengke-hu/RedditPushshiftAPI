Slipped up/Bummed out

So Tuesday will be 3 weeks.

I've been in a depression since quitting and last night was brutal. I also had some personal things happen this week that I was not prepared for emotionally or mentally.

I saw my ex and when he gave me a hug he slipped half a pack of smokes in my jacket pocket. He knew I had quit. There's a reason he's an ex. He would always encourage me to stay down, all while framing it as if he were being loving and supportive. 

So last night I slipped and smoked a few while I drove around crying and listening to sad songs and such.

Today I feel so sick. I actually called off the lil side job I have and love. I can't stop coughing and my whole body feels off. 

I destroyed the pack this morning, but I'm devastated and disappointed in myself. I'm having a hard time believing in myself and my quit after this slip.

And to think I have to go from 19 days to 0 just kills me.

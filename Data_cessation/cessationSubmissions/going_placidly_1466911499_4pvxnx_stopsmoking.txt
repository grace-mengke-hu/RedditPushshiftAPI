I'm gonna do it!!!

I stole a smoke from a fellow party goer and its in my chest pocket. Shhhhh. I'm so gonna smoke it. I've been anticipating this moment for a while and have been trying to convince myself why I shouldn't. I don't know why require convincing because I've pretty much made up my mind. I need to know if all my cravings are because I love smoking or because I forgot already why i hate it so much. I'm pretty drunk btw.

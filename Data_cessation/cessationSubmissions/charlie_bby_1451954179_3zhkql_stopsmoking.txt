Having a hard time

I haven't been smoking very long (~2yrs) but quitting is so hard. I quit for 3 days, but I relapsed and now cravings are unbearable. I know I need to quit, it doesn't do anything but suck my life and my money away. Does anyone have any tips to combat cravings and get to a smoke free life?

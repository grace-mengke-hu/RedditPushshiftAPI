How can I help my friend?

I have a great friend who, since I've met him has taken up smoking again. 

He tells me he smokes for two reasons, one is because he uses it to take a break and think. The other is that he has a kind of PTSD. 

While dealing with the fallout of a major disaster, he and all the other volunteers took up smoking to stop themselves smelling corpses. He tells me that sometimes he still smells the corpse smell and smoking is the only thing that makes it go away.

Can anyone suggest some ideas that might work for him? Is there anyway to get the smell of a cigarette without the toxic/addictive chemicals perhaps?

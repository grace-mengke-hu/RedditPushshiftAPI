Quit using allen carr's method 317 days ago, started again, any advice?

It was very easy to quit after i finished the book but i've started again after i found that my father has cancer. 

I've had 5 puffs from a spliff mixed with tobaco and the addiction was back instantly

I smoke 1 pack a day now, for 1 week

It would be great tofind out some thoughts from a person that was in the same spot as i am

Thanks

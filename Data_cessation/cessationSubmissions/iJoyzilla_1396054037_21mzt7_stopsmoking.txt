I'm going to a cocktail night tonight, can you guys give me some tips/ideas to get me through?

I am confident that I won't smoke at the event, but that doesn't mean to say I won't want to/be miserable that I can't (I'm hoping this doesn't happen, but I'm not going to be naive). 

I will be both indoors and outdoors. My best friend is hosting the event, and he is a smoker. I haven't seen him since I've quit just because I've been avoiding smokers, but today is the day I'm facing the triggers! 

Do you guys have any tips that would help me get through the evening? I will be drinking, but not excessively. I have gotten through two nights drinking so far without any issues (aside from one mini break down but I had far too much to drink). 

Any advice would be appreciated! Thanks :)

So tempted to start again even though I know I'll regret it.

Lately I've been dealing with some really bizarre wish to just start smoking again.  I'm tired and burnt out at work and have been a little depressed lately.  I work next to a window where people occasionally smoke outside in violation of the building code rules.  I've tried everything I can do to get some sort of signage or enforcement of the smoking policy but it just falls on deaf ears.  Its almost enough for me to want to quit my job.  Some days I want to just say forget it and pick up a pack at the store.  I mostly remember how horrible and difficult quitting was but as the experience gets further and further away I'm even more tempted to start again.

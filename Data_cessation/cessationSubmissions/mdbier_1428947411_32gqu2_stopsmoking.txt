This all helped me quit..... 31 days now...

So I got this app. Not sure why but it really helped. Part of the process is to share what worked. We're all different but I really hope that some of this will help someone!  Perhaps you can add something!

Stop smoking app, at least for the first month.
Wash the car so that it smells nice, keeps you from snoking in it. 
Chew gum.
Go to gym. A lot.
Cardiovascular exercise, like running.
Swimming, a lot.
Stopsmoking on Reddit.
Support from friends and family.
Not a puff mantra.
Making a list of reasons/benefit of quitting and updating it regularly.
Drinking tea.
Drinking lots of water.
Steam room at gym.

At some point you will need to let all of this go as they remind you of smoking. At some point you may realise that you no longer want or need to think of any of these things

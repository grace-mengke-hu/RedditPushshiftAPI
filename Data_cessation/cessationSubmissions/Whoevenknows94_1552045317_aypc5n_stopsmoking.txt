Anyone else quit cold turkey... off of step 1 patches?

So a few years ago I quit kind of easily. Stopped cigarettes, and had fractions of black and mild (lived next to a gas station, if I had a craving, bout one, smoked a little, saved the rest for later cravings). Did that for a couple weeks, then used a step 2 patch for 3 day, then that was it. I had no more forms of nicotine and had no cravings. 

This time has been alot harder. Long story short, been doing everything from cigarettes, cigars, vapes, and patches to try to taper down my nicotine intake. Nothing was working for months. I guess I just got motivated enough a few week ago, and by yesterday I had 3 days with just the step 1 patch, nothing else.

Yesterday I got to work... I forgot to put on a patch. Well this will be fun i thought. It wasnt to bad, but i ate about 5000 calories (i usually count). Now this morning I'm feeling it. Horrible headache, exhausted after sleeping 9 hours, and my digestive system if fucked. But I figured hey, I have 24 hours under my belt, let's keep going. I just have friday to get through, then it's the weekend, and I can sleep and relax as I get through the worst days. Ugh it's just been a wild ride and I'm dying for it to be over. I'm so desperate. Anyway thanks for listening, I know I'm ranting for really no reason.

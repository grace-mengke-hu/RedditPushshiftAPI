So I want to quit but also dont

Alright so I am 20 I started smoking when I was 15, I know everything bad about smoking, I know the advantages of stopping, here is the problem, I don't think I want to. Now keep in mind that I am a downer, I am sad most days, but don't believe in depression, I smoke to kill time to relieve stress and over all, because I don't care about my health. So my next logical step would be "do it For those around you" well, my dad smokes and we only bond over cigarettes, my brother is the same as my dad, all but one of my friends smoke and although we hang out and not smoke we seem to have a better time when we do. And the one that doesn't smoke makes me want to smoke because all we ever talk about is them, not entirely their fault I'm not one to talk about myself no matter who it is so it's just a default for them. And my mother and I don't have the best relationship. She is highly Christian and I'm an atheist and she will try to shove her religion down my neck and it always ends with a fight and me storming out for a smoke just to escape. Again not all her fault I start my fair share. I have 2 nieces but their father and his family hates me and my sister sides with them so I barely see them. Basically I have no reason to not smoke other than "it's bad for you" and I couldn't care less. So after all this has anyone else felt this? And if so please give advice

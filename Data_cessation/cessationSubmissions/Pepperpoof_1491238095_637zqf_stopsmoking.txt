Day One: Still haven't smoked, but good God I'm angry! Feel like I'm losing my mind.

I was doing good until eleven-ish, lol. Then I made the mistake of going to the DQ near my apartment. They screwed my order up twice. As in, two times in a row. I'm still not sure how you screw up a plain cheeseburger order-it's plain, there's just meat and cheese on it. So, there went lunch.

Then my son started stimming (he's severely autistic, so this is pretty standard for him). Loudly. Yelling, hitting himself, stomping, you name it. Normally, I can handle it, but NOT today-and my husband is completely ignoring the issue, so I HAVE to handle it whether I'm capable of doing so calmly or not. I'm not sure if I'm more irritated by the yelling and hitting or the fact that my husband has just left me alone to deal with it while he goes off and plays video games like a damn teenager. 

So far, I haven't smoked, though, lol. I feel like screaming, but I haven't smoked!

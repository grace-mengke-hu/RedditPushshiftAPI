Are headaches normal?

I'm completely out of it today! I had a smoking dream last night....In my dream I felt sick nauseous wise, sore throat, and with a headache. I thought I had symptoms of ebola in my dream (Lol) then someone offered me a cigarette and I took a couple puffs and felt instantly better physically, but felt horribly mentally because I caved in. I was disappointed in myself. Then I woke up relieved that I didn't actually smoke but I did wake up with a real life annoying dull aching headache all day... I just need to go back to sleep! It's had me in a fog all day... Boo to my first smoking dream :-( But yay that it's been 16 days!! 
Does any else get headaches?

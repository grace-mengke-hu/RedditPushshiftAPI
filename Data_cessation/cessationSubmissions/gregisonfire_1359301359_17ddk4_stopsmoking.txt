Cessation Nation App

Couple questions before I download this app:

I was looking into getting this app, but saw that it can post to Facebook. Is this automatic or is there a way to turn this off? I don't like any apps having access to my Facebook account. 

Has this app helped you? What benefits do you see to having this app rather than not?

Rough time

I'm having a rough time and find myself missing smoking for the first time in 4 years. I won't go back. I'm just having a rough time with life. 

My grandma passed away, my aunt that didn't want anything has decided grandma didn't live long enough  under my care to give me anything, I don't have a home to call my own as a result, she has told horrible lies about me to everyone she can and refuses to talk with me. I'm falling apart and don't know what to do.

I really want to sit down in the garage with a cigarette like I used to with my grandma and cry.

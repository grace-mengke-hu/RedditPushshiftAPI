Weird cravings 1 month after nicotine free.

I quit cigarettes by vaping (2 years ago). I quit vaping by chewing Nicorette gum (2.5 months ago). I quit Nicorette &amp; nicotine altogether by slowly replacing it with normal gum &amp; mints. That was 4 weeks ago when I had my last piece of Nicorette gum (a 1 mg piece that was the only piece I chewed that day). Since then, I have only been chewing normal gum, and more frequently lately, normal mints. It was hard at first, but now I feel great and haven't had any serious cravings lately.

So, now I want to stop the gum and mints (honestly, my mouth is starting to hurt from all that stuff). Its just normal sugar free gum &amp; months, so should be easy, right? Um...no; not so much. I haven't had any gum or mints today and I find I am having some of the worst cravings of this whole journey today. 

Is it possible that because I transitioned away the nicotine so slowly that my brain doesn't understand it doesn't **need** the gum or mints, and is freaking out in their absence? Its just very weird and frustrating. I mean, I know I don't need to pop a mint for any chemical or biological reason anymore that I need to suck on an apricot or a pork chop right now. But, nonetheless...there it is. A very strong craving that will just not go away. 

WTF is going on here? Am I just nuts?

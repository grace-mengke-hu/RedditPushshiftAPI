Day 28 of being a non smoker: I changed my mindset

I can honestly say that this is it, my relationship with cigarettes is over. I never thought I would say that. During my many previous attempts to quit I have always been thinking up ways of having a sneaky smoke or just having the one cigarette with a glass of wine or convincing myself that I could be a social smoker.

I used to really resent not smoking and would turn down offers of nights out if I was having a quit attempt. I would be moody and sulky about not smoking.

I don't know how or why it happened but 28 days ago with a stinking hangover I just thought 'that's it, I'm done with smoking'! 

Yes I'm using patches and have vaped a little on nights out but not once have I thought ooooo I could murder a ciggie!

I guess what I'm trying to say is that by changing my mindset from being resentful about not smoking to 'I'm so bloody glad that I don't smoke' I have not had any desire at all to smoke an actual stinky cigarette. Yes I have had cravings but these were more of a want than a need and they have always been during times when I would usually light up. As I already mentioned even during these times I knew that I didn't want an actual cigarette.

I hope that anybody else who is reading this and has already quit or is thinking of doing so manages to change their thinking and I wish you all the luck in world! Xx

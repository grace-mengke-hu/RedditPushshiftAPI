Punishing Cravings?

Earlier today I was thinking a little about how smoking becomes so closely tied to certain feelings/actions such as drinking alcohol, driving, being in the sun, feeling happy, feeling sad etc.

I was wondering if it would be a good idea to inflict some minor pain in response to a craving. Therefore, you would create the mental note that craving a cigarette = pain. 

I was thinking about perhaps carrying a rubber band and snapping it on the wrist when I get a craving. Or biting my tongue.

Any advice on this? Thoughts?

Any love for quiting vaping in here?

I smoked for 7 years before I picked a vape up and I have been vaping for a year now. I have slowly gotten down to 3mg of nic in my juice but I'm finding it much harder to make the switch to 0mg than I did to make the switch to vaping in the first place. 

When you quit smoking you can feel your body improving but when it comes to putting down the vape you don't feel all the positives you just feel negative. I've tried multiple times to quit but I haven't had any luck. Anyone got any advice? I'm sick of it.

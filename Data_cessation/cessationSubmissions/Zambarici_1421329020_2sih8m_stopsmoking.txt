First Milestone

10 smoking-free days have passed. So far so good, but a very busy year is coming ahead: need to do my master thesis, pass the hardest class ever and work to get money to pay for school. All while I have to deal with my travel anxiety and fear of choking. And that exact experience shows me that I can do anything, overcome everything. Whenever I need to travel from A to B I tell myself that I have to do it whether or not I enjoy the ride. I need to get to B no matter what. I came to the conclusion I always need 10 minutes to get used to the new situation (being on a metro) and I am applying the same principle regarding stopping smoking. I am not going to get disturbed by people that smoke for more than 10 minutes. I do believe anyone can stop smoking and I am going to be the example for my friends! PS: Be gentle, as this is my first post. I'm new to reddit as I created the account to join discussion on this sub.

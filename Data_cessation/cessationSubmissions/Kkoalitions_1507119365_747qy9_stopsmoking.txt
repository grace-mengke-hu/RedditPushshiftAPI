Been here before. Tried but failed. Time to try again. with help ;)

I've tried to motivate myself in the past to dump smoking, but never managed to go further than 3-4 weeks. Parties always made me go back to smoking.
So this time i decided to make it a bit different. i've got a bet going with my good friend- If i manage to not smoke for 6 months, he's gonna pay for plane tickets to Canada for a skiing new years eve 2018-19. If i fail... I need to wear a single pair of g strings for a month and document it daily, and wax my chest hairs. 
I think im done.

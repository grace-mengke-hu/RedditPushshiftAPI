Today is the first day. Day one. Today.

Today when I woke up I said to myself 'This is it. I hate everything about smoking and I feel so unhealthy. Time to make a change.' 

First thing I did getting off the train today was go and buy some gum where I usually buy a pack. I've been telling people all morning. I am going to make it stick this time. 

This will probably get paved over by the achievements of those with more time than I, but it feels nice to write this out. 

Today is the first day. Day one.

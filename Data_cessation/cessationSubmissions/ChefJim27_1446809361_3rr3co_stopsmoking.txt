5 bucks in the coffee can

For every day I'm smoke free, I've been putting the rough cost of a pack, which is around 5 bucks, into a coffee can. I've got 30 bucks in there now. When I'm done paying off my wife's car, I'll have a grand saved for the down payment for my own new car without even trying.

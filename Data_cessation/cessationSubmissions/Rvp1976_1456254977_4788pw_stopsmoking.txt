My First Post...

I have been reading threads on this site for several weeks and decided to finally subscribe and share. Reading your posts have kept me motivated and provided strength when I had moments of weakness. My story..I have smoked since I was 15 and tried to quit countless times. 24 years later I am giving quitting another try. The longest I have gone cigarette free is 6 months. I am on day 46 on this "quit". I used the patch for almost 5 weeks so I am on day 11 with no nicotine. I am having headaches, coughing up years of smoking, have no energy, and I am very moody. The cravings have eased but I know I am still vulnerable to relapsing. Just wanted to air it out to a group who knows what I am going through. Stay strong everyone and hope to read about more success stories.

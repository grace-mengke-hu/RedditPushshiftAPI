Reset me to 25 days please

Ended up relapsing about 3 months into my last quit, stayed away from here out of shame.  But \- I'm trying again, and am 25 days into my quit.

Last night was a milestone, as it marked the first time during my quit that I drank alcohol.  And.... no cigarettes! Makes this hangover almost feel good!

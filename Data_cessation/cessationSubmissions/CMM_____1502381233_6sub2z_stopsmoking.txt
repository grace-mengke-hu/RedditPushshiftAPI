I need your help!!!

Been browsing this sub off and on for awhile. Ive had several attempts at quitting over the past year, ranging from 3 days to 3 weeks. The hardest part for me is pulling the trigger and actually quitting - then getting through day 4. After that it’s usually smooth sailing - but I always end up going back thinking I can handle “just one”.

I am a recovering addict clean for just over 2 years, psychology major and have worked in the rehabilitation industry. I understand addiction and that it is a disease, allergy, etc. I have read Allen Carr and like how it frames quitting smoking as a reward system (getting shit back) vs. giving something up. However, I can’t seem to engrain these attitudes into practice.

I want to quit, I hate smoking, I hate that I stink, I hate the money I spend, I hate how it pisses off my gf, but I want to quit. It’s always been about money or health or my relationship but I want to quit because I want to quit, not because of any external force. 

I have patches that I’m considering using, in the past I’ve used lozenges and they seemed to really help. But I’ve also heard conflicted reports success with NRT vs cold turkey.

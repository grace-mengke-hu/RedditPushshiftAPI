Four days in, feeling so ill

I quit all nicotine (vaping, cigarettes) four days ago after being addicted for 10 months. 
I feel so ill mentally and physically, I’m so nauseous, my head is pounding always, and my anxiety and depression are at all time highs. 
I can’t even really eat, because I already have little appetite due to my nausea, and then when I do eat, I can’t even hold it down because it seems to want to come out one way or another. 
It’s getting to the point where I’m barely able to function, does anyone have any advice especially on how to deal with the nausea/stomach ache situation? Honestly at a loss right now other than drinking a lot of water.

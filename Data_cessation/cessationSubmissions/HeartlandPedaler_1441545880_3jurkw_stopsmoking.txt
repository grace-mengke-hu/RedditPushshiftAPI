"I can't wait to see your butterfly"

September 1st, 2013, I quit smoking. September 2nd, 2013, I started smoking again. This pattern repeated until September 4th, 2013, when I had my last cigarette. That was 631 days ago. It was a fitting end to my 5+ years of being a 1/2-pack a day smoker; I had just finished a pizza and went out on the porch for my final cigarette, when I accidentally swallowed smoke, instantly hurling up the pizza I just ate. With the taste of vomit in my mouth and a 1/3 of a cig left, I put it out and went to bed. 

Much has happened in the two years since I've quit smoking. I've had close relatives pass, relationships end, and had a complete career change that came along with a change of location. Everything that should've triggered my cravings only strengthened my sobriety. What follows is what worked for me, especially in the first 12 months of quitting smoking:

**Avoiding triggers, including coffee and alcohol** 
Drinking and smoking use to go hand-in-hand for me, and understanding that I wasn't just quitting smoking but also **changing my lifestyle** was a huge part of my success. It *can suck*, but my friends who were understanding and supportive would offer other avenues of social interaction so I never felt alone. 9 months after quitting smoking I started drinking coffee and alcohol again, but in *much less* proportions. Instead of being drunk every weekend, I may have a drink on the weekend. I maybe have an all out rager every three months, and even during those times I don't smoke.  

**Quitting cold turkey**.
I tried patches. I tried e-cigs. Neither worked for me because while I was getting nicotine, I wasn't getting the same rush and physical sensation that smoking gave me. I ended up frustrated and more likely to start smoking again on replacement nicotine than if I did nothing, so I chose to go that route.  

**Reading The Book** Specifically, Allen Carr's book. Seriously. Check your ego, check your defiance, and just take in the words. 

I still think about cigarettes. The most annoying thing is going through a day not thinking about them, realize you aren't thinking about them, then start thinking about them. I dream about smoking as a former smoker way more than I ever did as a smoker. The difference is that my thoughts of smoking quickly give way to thoughts of what I can achieve now that I've quit smoking, especially saving up for a new bike because now I have SO MUCH MORE money to actually invest in a passion, and physical capacity to enjoy doing so. My life as a whole feels more genuine, and knowing that **I made it that way** has brought me to a whole different level of confidence that is quiet, humble, and internal. Through keeping the course, I hope to make it external. 

While going through withdrawal I told my friend that I felt like a caterpillar in a cocoon, going through metamorphosis, and they responded "I can't wait to see your butterfly". Keep working on your cocoons!

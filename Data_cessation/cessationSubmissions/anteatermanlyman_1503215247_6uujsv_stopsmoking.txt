Looking for motivation

Hello, things are good in my life right now. My boyfriend has quit since June 1, and I've been only on nicotine aids for the same amount of time. I've found an addiction to Rubiks cubes and those sorts of puzzles lol (and I recommend it to anyone who's got a restless head like mine). I guess I'm just looking for a push to finally kick the habit, I've felt ready for like a month now.

Thanks in advance, I'm sorry that I do not reply right away, though. I try to keep my internet use to a minimum.

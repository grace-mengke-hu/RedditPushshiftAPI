On day 10, spent time with my smoker friends last night and didn't bum any smokes, feeling pretty good overall

How is everyone else holding up with the weekend looming?  You're all wonderful and strong and [You can do it!](http://imgur.com/SJGPZYn) 

I've had some slap-in-the-face cravings, but they actually passed pretty quickly.  It's more like my brain is flashing "Hey! I miss this!" messages at me.  Part of me misses it, but a much larger part of me is happy that I'm not smoking.

I also stopped drinking soda this week.  What the hell is wrong with me?! No wonder I'm tired and headachy.

3 digits! (And a question about shisha/hookah)

I decided to pay this sub a quick visit only to find I'm already over 100 days! I don't think I'd have made it past the first month if it weren't for this place. The support here is amazing. Thank you to all who offered support, advice and encouragement during the tough times (so far.) Hope the quit continues and lasts at least another 100! 

Now on to the question. Few days ago I went out with friends and they invited me to have some shisha. I tried the plain one but the taste and everything reminded me of smoking tobacco. I was worried about it possibly causing a relapse so I went for a flavoured one instead. I know the flavoured one still had nictoine but I didn't have a craving for tobacco afterwards. My chest felt tight but that's about it. 

I'm not planning on making it a regular thing (more like very rare) but part of me is still worried that I may have got back to square one this way? Does having shisha means you restart from the beginning? Have you quit and still use it sometimes? Would appreciate some help. Thanks!

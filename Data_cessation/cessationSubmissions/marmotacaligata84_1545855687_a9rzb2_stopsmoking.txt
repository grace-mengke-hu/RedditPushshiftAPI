Day 005. All the years of hiding my emotions behind a cigarette... all those years are spilling out in a matter of days.

For years I've hidden pieces of my emotions and personality behind smoking.  It's all bubbling over and out now.  


I'm crying randomly.  Laughing.  Feeling nostalgic.  Feeling hopeless, but then feeling unstopable.  Feeling irritated, but then feeling free. 

I have doubts, and worries.  I want to scream, and jump up and down. 

I go for a walk, that turns into a run. 

I stop at the corner, and forget which way to turn. 

It's just the vaguest of things.  

But they're all spilling over the top.  All over my day and my relationships and my work.  All over the damn place. 


I AM feeling better though.  I'm laughing at things I haven't laughed at in years.  I caught myself skipping down the street yesterday.  My breathe is better than it's been in years.  I've maybe found some pieces of my personality I thought I had lost... eons ago.  I guess they were just hiding. 


I hope you're feeling better too.     If you've quit, and are struggling, know you aren't alone.  I'm not smoking with you today.  We can do this.

You guys are very helpful, almost through 1st full day of quitting

Smoked my last cig last night around 11 pm. I have almost reached 24hrs of no smoking. Its been an incredibly tough day,  one that has showed me how much it takes control of. Thanks to this sub,  i have pushed off 2 tough cravings. My brain keeps trying to make excuses as to why 1 will be ok. Thanks to you guys,  i am finding some courage to persuade myself back to reason. 31 been smoking since i was 14. Going cold turkey too. But i got to do this,  tired of my little one watching me as i smoke,  breaks my heart to be honest. So just wanted to say thanks to the community for the support i see.

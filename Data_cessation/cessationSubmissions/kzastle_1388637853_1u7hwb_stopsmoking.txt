On the patch

Started quitting a couple weeks ago with nicotine transdermal patches and I've got to say- it doesn't suck that bad. I just moved to step two today after three weeks of step one patches. I wish they weren't so expensive, though. I'm buying the generic brand, which is half as expensive and its still hurting my wallet. Then again, 22 bucks for a weeks worth of patches beats 25 for a weeks worth of smokes, and I can enjoy sitting inside instead of freezing my ass off smoking in the new jersey winter.

Just dropping in to share my experience. Enjoying it so far. My SO loves the lack of me smelling like smoke, and my body is thanking me every day for not harming it any more. Side note - nicotine patch dreams are fucking ridiculous.


Good luck to all of you quitting any way you can. It took me three different times and three different ways to figure out how to quit this time, so just keep working at it and you'll find something that works for you.

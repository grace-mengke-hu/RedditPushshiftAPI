it's still tough at day 19.. any advice from others at this stage?

I'm on day 19 now and I thought I was past all the tough days. Don't get me wrong, the first 3-5 days sucked big time and the physical cravings were massive (5 years smoking will do that to you..), but now things have shifted a bit. Physical cravings are gone mostly, however I still can look in the rear view mirror and see what it was like and remember smoking. It just kicks my ass sometimes, the mental effort. I am keeping busy, staying positive and focused on the moment, but since I don't have smoking as a tool anymore to manage my emotions I am really forced to restart my engine and do the whole thing differently. 

Thanks for listening folks any advice on what worked for you during this stage would be helpful.

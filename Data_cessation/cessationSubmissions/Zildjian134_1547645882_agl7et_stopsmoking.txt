9 days in and sleep improvements are finally starting to show

Along with the help of melatonin tablets, I'm finally getting decent sleep. I've quit several times before for a few months at a time and this is the first time I've had sleep issues other than occasional nightmares. I went 72 hours with 5 hours of sleep this past weekend and had a couple nights of less than 3 last week. The past few night have finally been 7-8 hrs of sleep. Hopefully the worst of that has passed and I can just go back to being pissy like a normal quitter haha.

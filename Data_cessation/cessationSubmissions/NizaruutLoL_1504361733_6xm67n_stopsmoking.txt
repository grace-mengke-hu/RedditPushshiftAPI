Fresh "non-smoker" here

I just stopped smoking cigarettes about a week ago. I tried many times and failed. So this Time i switched to smoking an E-Cigarette. Now my question:

I got liquid with 6mg of nicotine in it. Anyone else who stopped smoking completely with switching to an E-cig first? I feel better already, but wanna stop everything soon. Any Advice?

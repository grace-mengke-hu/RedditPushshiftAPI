Back to Day One, wish me luck!

I quit last night--again--and I'm feeling pretty positive so far.  Last time I quit "for real", it was five weeks before I slipped up.  This time, I'm not going to slip up.  I have about 1,000 pieces of gum stocked up at home, at work, in my purse, and in my car to help me avoid giving in to cravings.  I'm ready!

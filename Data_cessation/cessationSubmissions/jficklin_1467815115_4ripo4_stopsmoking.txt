Celebrating 50 days nicotine free

After nearly 10 years of smoking this is a major accomplishment for me. Past attempts with nicotine replacements failed for me. Cold turkey has been the only approach that has worked for **me**. No vaping, no gum, no lozenges, etc. 

For those who are struggling within the first two weeks (it get's so much easier). I have had moments within the last couple of weeks or so where I get a small craving, but it passes quickly. Also, this sub helped me out a ton. Anytime I felt a craving, I would get on my phone and read the posts here. Beyond helpful and encouraging. 

I'm super committed and I feel great. My fiance is also jazzed. She's been trying to get me to quit for years. Here's to another 50 more days nicotine free. 

Thanks!

First time here. I want to quit smoking. Any advice?

I started when i was late 16 and im 17 now.
I recently started dieting and exercising and its hard to do while smoking.
I havent smoked long enough for it to really hurt me you know? But its not good.
I have 5 cigarettes in a pack right now. I plan on not smoking after i run out which will be sometime today.
What can i do to stop? I have tried before but didnt last past 2 hours. Do i regain my health after quiting?

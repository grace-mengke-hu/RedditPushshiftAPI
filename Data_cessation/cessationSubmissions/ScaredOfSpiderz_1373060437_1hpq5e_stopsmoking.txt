Is it all just a lie?

Hi, this is a great reddit you guys have, I'm glad I found it. I'm definitely gonna be on it to help me with this new choice of lifestyle I'm making.

Please let me know if you share this idea I have:

I'm getting the feeling that, on top of being addicted to a substance, we're also convinced that it's hard to get off that substance. Why is that? Why do we think it's hard? The side-effects are negligible and the advantages are enormous.

Could it be that someone, somewhere, at some point in time introduced the idea that it was hard to quit and that the benefiting parties proceeded to carefully cultivate this idea through the media, creating a mindset that we now take for granted? Not as a conspiracy but as kind of an unspoken understanding? I don't think this is a very crazy idea when you realize that both the pro-smoking and the anti-smoking industry benefit from this mindset.  

When I realized this two days ago I just kind of stopped smoking without any hassle about it. It was weird. Like looking in the mirror and realizing you have been walking around with your dick out all day. And then I look around and I see all kinds of people with their dicks out, and I want to say to them: “hey, you're dick is out.” 

So anyway, I went from 1.5 packs of cigarettes for (I think) 13 years to 0 without substitutes and I guess I'll see where this thing will take me. 

Please let me know if you think there's any validity to this theory at all.

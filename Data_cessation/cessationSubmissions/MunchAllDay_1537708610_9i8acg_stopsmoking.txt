Well this happened far quicker than expected

So I ran out of weed and for reasons I won't go into, I couldn't get any more. I liked smoking weed. And it would be a couple weeks until I could get more. So after a week when I felt frustrated, I thought 'what the hell, I can smoke a cig every now and then at parties, why not get a pack only for now until I get my weed'.

2 weeks later, today, I'm on my 6th pack. And my weed has yet to arrive. When I woke up 3 hours ago, I thought 'today I will not smoke anything, just to know that it's no problem'. And on average I have thought about lighting one up every 30 minutes since.

I have fucked about with many drugs for the past 3 years, but never really had an issue with addiction. I don't know why I'm writing, this just surprised me and I felt like sharing.

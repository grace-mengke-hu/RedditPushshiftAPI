Feeling pretty good

10 weeks....I've identified all my triggers and I think I'm doing pretty well avoiding them or at least being prepared should I be unable to avoid.  Until this week.  My daughter, who my wife & I have successfully managed to keep out of hospital for almost 18 years, was admitted on Sunday with a very nasty viral infection.  Because of work I can't stay with her during the day but I am trying to spend as much time in the evenings.  Every time my mind drifts I think about her and the worry seems to trigger a craving.  Then the long hours at the hospital trigger cravings because I'm bored and worried.

But I'm still here.

TL;DR
Kiddo in the hospital. Stress & worry inducing cravings. Still going.

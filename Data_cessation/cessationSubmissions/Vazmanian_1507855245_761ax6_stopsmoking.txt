Is this a good way to help me quit smoking?

Hey! 2 days ago I decided to go cold turkey, I am struggling a lot. I can continue cold turkey but I am really not enjoying this haha. 
Despite the fact I know I CAN continue cold turkey, I was hoping to find another way to do this. 
Would a cigar (not inhaling) once a day, every night before sleep for a couple of weeks help me? The main issue with cold turkey for me is that I cannot seem to sleep, and I seem to be really upset at the idea I won't be able to have another smoke again. 
I thought maybe knowing I'd be able to enjoy something similar to a cigarette would help. 

What are your thoughts?

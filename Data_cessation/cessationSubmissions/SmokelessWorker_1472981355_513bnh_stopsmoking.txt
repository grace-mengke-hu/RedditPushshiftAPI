Actually Quitting ~ Finally

I have managed to quit for a month before, but stupidly had 'just one'. We all know how that ends.

Been two days, I usually only smoke at work, so... tomorrow is Monday. Wish me luck. Work is stressful because people annoy me with inane chatter and gossip. Idk how I will cope without smokes, but I want to quit. Once and for all.

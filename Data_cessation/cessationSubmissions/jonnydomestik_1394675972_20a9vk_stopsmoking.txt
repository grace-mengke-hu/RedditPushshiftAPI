110 Days!

I haven't been on this sub for a while but I decided to check my badge and I was amazed to see that I haven't had a cigarette in 110 days! WOW!
I was a smoker from 14-29 with a 6 month break using chantix but this time I just stopped cold turkey. I can go out drinking or hang out with my friends who smoke without any trouble. I didn't smoke a cigarette during finals (I'm in law school).
Even though I haven't been around lately, I just wanted to thank you all for your support 110 days ago and for a couple months after.

Help me yall

Look, all I think about is quitting all day and by night it's easy as hell to just be like, yeah I'm done, cigarettes are blah blah blah. But as soon as I wake up, all of it is gone and I don't care. I'm going to have my cigarette in the morning and at my 10:15 break and my lunch break. How do I wake up with a different mindset? How do I convince myself in the morning to say enough is enough. Stop wasting your money, stop wasting your time, stop wasting your life. You're better than  this addiction. You have the ability to drop it and never look back. You're only smoking because you believe you can't stop. You can stop whenever you want. So stop fooling yourself. I just want to be real with myself. I don't want this over my mind every single day convicting myself that I'm not strong enough to quit this. I just want out and I don't know how anymore. I haven't even made it a day in months. And I've been smoking since I was 16 and now I'm 21 about to turn 22. I don't want to be the man who never stomped this bullshit out of my life. I need help y'all.

6 days smoke free so far with champix

I was scared to use champix because of all the post I've seen but this is my 16th day on it and 6 days smoke free. Best decision ever. I failed so many times before. What's different now is that I don't think about smoking or feel like smoking at all. Because of smoking I used to go out 3-4 times a day buy coffee, go for a drive and smoke. Now I don't even feel like drinking coffee. Just wanted to share my experience so far.

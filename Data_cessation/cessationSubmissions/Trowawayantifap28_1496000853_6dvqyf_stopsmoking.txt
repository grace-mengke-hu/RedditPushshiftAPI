20 years of smoking, i start today!

Guys, glad i found you! I smoked now for almost 20 years and it stops today. I feel exhaustes, my lifepower drained, although i have a very athletic body time. But i have become such a fucking weak pussy its embarrassing. I used to be to be the top2 long distance runner of my school, nowadays i run 100m and i am almost dying.  
As i have tried to stop smoking before many times, i know this will be my hardest challenge so far in my life. 
But also i am pissed that this shit substance is controlling my thoughts and my life and i want to reclaim the scepter of power over my thoughts, will and body. Wish me a strong will!! :)

Happy Friday, y'all! That being said, one thing about my night sucks...

I'm at a friend's house and we're playing cards.  His friend is also here, and they both smoke.  The main problem with this is that by pure chance, I'm at the end of the table, opposite the fan.  Yep, for the past 3 or 4 hours they've been chain smoking and it's all blown right in my general direction.  

The obvious solution would be for me to switch seats, but I'll be inhaling a tonne of smoke, no matter where I sit.  And likewise, I'm strong and will make it through the night, no matter what.

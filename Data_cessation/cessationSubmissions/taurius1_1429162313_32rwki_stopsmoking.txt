I just... stopped.

I don't know what happened. I've been struggling to quit for the longest time. I only ever smoked twice a day, so I didn't ever think that I had a super compelling reason to quit. The most I've gone nicotine free was 6 months. And that took : quite : a bit of effort. 
About a week ago, I ran out of smokes, and I did not feel particularly compelled to go out and get one. Life's been a huge combination of near depression and anxiety hitting me in waves, and I've been trying to find happiness wherever I can. From what I know of my triggers, I should be smoking more than ever now. But... I don't quite know. I just haven't felt the nicotine craving after the first two days. Other things in the way I think about life have changed a bit as well, perhaps it's related. But, I'll figure that out some other time when I'm not as afraid of running into triggers that will make me start again. 

Has something like this ever happened to any of you? Or to anyone you know? The nicotine cravings are no long strong enough for me to want to actually light up any more.

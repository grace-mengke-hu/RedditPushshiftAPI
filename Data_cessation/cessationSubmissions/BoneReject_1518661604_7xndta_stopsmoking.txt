Captain's Log-Day two. Cigarette/ e-cig free. What I've learned thus far.

 Holy cow, man.

Using an electronic cigarette for 3 years has caused some major habits. The hardest of which is constantly searching for something to hold to my mouth while doing pretty much everything. 

Tried just gum  yesterday, helped keep my mouth busy, but my hands were stressed. (Hand stress is a real thing, ok.)
Today I picked up my Camelbak waterbottle- the kind with the squishy mouth piece. Held it in my mouth and it solved the problem! Mouth and hands, satisfied. 

Hardest part is waking up in the morning. I would like to stop drinking coffee...
Any advice on replacement drinks/ things to do during this time?

You guys rule. Glad to be a first time poster.

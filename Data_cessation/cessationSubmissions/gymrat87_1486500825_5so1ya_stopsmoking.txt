It`s been 9 days - Resting heart rate improvements!

I'm a 29 years old female who's relatively fit.  I've been working out 4-6 days a week for the last 6 years.  I've always been pretty health conscious except for smoking..which is a major health killer.  I finally got to a point where I started feeling stupid every time I lit up a cigarette.  
It started getting to me more this Summer.  I got a new doctor and I met him for the first time.  I couldn't wait to talk to him about my workout schedule and nutrition habits.  As soon as he found out I was a smoker, he wasn't very interested in hearing about my lifestyle.  He told me (not in a rude way, just honest) that all the healthy things I was doing was a waste because I was a  smoker. 
I haven't smoked for 9 days now and I feel fantastic.  I noticed something pretty cool about my heart rate.  I wear a fitbit 24/7 and I noticed that prior to quitting smoking, my resting heart rate was around 60 bpm.  9 days later, my heart rate is resting at 51 bpm which is very good.  My motivation has never been this high, it's so amazing to see these kinds of improvements.

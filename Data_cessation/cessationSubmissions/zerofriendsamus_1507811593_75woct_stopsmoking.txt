think i'm allowed to say i'm not a smoker anymore !

i got a new phone a few days ago and i didn't even bother downloading the Smoke Free app again because i don't even think about smoking anymore. i've lost count of how many days it's been since i last had a cigarette because it's just not something i think about. that feels huge to me. i feel like i am allowed to say i quit smoking now instead of saying i'm quitting smoking. 

it hasn't been easy at all. i've preoccupied myself with a heck of a lot of running, meditating, yoga, H20, and chewing gum. but i can happily say i'm confident i will not smoke ever again. i have declined countless offers from my friends, even whilst drinking (i'm subbed to /stopdrinking now also)

i used to look forward to waking up and having a cig and a coffee and now i look forward to feeling the fresh air outside in my lungs. i feel so good! and i can't wait to feel even better! 

❤️❤️so thankful for this sub and all the posts and stories. very inspiring. ❤️❤️

TLDR; i did it, you can do it, i have faith in each one of you

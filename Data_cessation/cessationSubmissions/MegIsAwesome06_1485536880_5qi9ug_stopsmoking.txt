Dreamt about smoking last night

Had a dream where I was smoking a cig and I got about halfway through it before realizing that I quit. I was so disappointed in myself in my dream. 
But I tasted that cigarette. I feel like I got that REAL last cigarette. (When I quit, it wasn't intentional. I almost drowned and was sick for 4 days from salt water intake. I realized if I started again it would be dumb...)
So I guess I kind of got closure. 
And to whoever is reading this: you can do this. It's not as hard as you're making it out to be in your head. YOU CAN DO THIS!

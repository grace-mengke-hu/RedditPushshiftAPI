Day 6

I had a scare this morning and realized that my first instinct was NOT to run out and get cigarettes. I didn’t think about it or have a craving at all. Even when I consciously thought this would be the perfect excuse to cave I didn’t want to. 
This is very encouraging for me and hope this observation helps others

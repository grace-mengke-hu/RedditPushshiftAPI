Made it 2 weeks

I'm slowly putting some space between myself and the old habit. This time dealing with the situation as a psychological problem instead of a physical one has made all the difference. 

My body isn't addicted. My mind had associated cigarettes as a reward. Once I really started seeing that as nonsense, it got much easier. They aren't a reward, they stink and they're toxic.

I wish I'd done this so long ago!

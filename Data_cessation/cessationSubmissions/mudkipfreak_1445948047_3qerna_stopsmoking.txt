Quit smoking but still coughing up a lot

I quit for stoptober. It hasn't been as hard as i thought it would. When i decided to finally stop i had already been cutting down from about 15-20 a day to 5 a day. As soon as i quit i noticed i was coughing up ALOT of green shit, and this started to go down up until a few days a go.

At the weekend I went to see a buddy for his 20th party. It was lovely but him, and all his friends, as massive smokers/pot smokers, and because of that 30+  people were smoking in his kitchen at once. I didn't feel the need to do any, but when i woke up i coughed up more green phlegm than i ever have in my life, and it hasn't slowed down since then.

I guess my question is, have i fucked up my lungs for a lil while by going to this party, or is this just kinda natural for someone who's quitting?

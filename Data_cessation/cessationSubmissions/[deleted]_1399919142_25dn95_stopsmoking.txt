It gets easier.

I've now quit for 2 months. I started smoking when I was 15(5 years ago) and going through a lot in my life. I wanted to write something here to let people know it gets easier, when I first started quitting I was depressed and it felt like I was missing a friend but now, I don't think about cigarettes. It's not the first thing I think of when I wake up and I can finally breathe and not feel that weight on my chest. I used an app called "quit it" and it's really helped. I was a pack a day smoker and one of my main motives for quitting was money. I've saved 378 dollars already that would have gone to cigarettes and I would've smoke 1,370 cigarettes in the time since I quit. I'm really writing here just to say that it is hard, but extremely worth it and it does only get easier with time. If you find yourself in the middle of quitting and you break and smoke, don't feel bad about yourself and just relapse back to being a smoker, but instead realize what made you tick and substitute that habit for a healthier alternative. This sub-reddit is great for quitting and I just want to let everyone who reads this know that we all are rooting for each other in the battle against our own vices and that in the the end ANYONE can quit and you can of you chose to. I'm kind of ranting but you get the point, keep up the good work!

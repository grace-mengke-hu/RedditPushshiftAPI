Happy to be 30 days nicotine and smoke free

Thanks for being here. A couple months ago I subscribed to this sub-reddit to keep thoughts of quitting percolating in my head. I think it helped because 30 days ago, I decided no more cigarettes. I'm done.

My fear of quitting was far worse than the reality of quitting. It hasn't been bad at all. I feel better and I am thrilled to be free of the addiction.

I know that another puff could easily send me back to addiction though so I need to be vigilant.

If you are thinking of quitting - dive in. You can handle it.

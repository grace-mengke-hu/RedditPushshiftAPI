Started over, again

My flair is currently being updated - it is off by a day - but I am now (as of writing this) 7 days, 10 hours and 30 minutes into my latest quit attempt.

I tried about a month ago - and made it to this point, but a medical crisis with my SO caused my resolve to weaken... So here I am again my fellow non-smokers, and trying to keep to the path. But I am finding it really, really, really hard today to not break down and go get some of that concentrated burning evil.

Once again, I am hugging my vape to death - down to 12mg liquid, and just about out of it at that. But I find the cravings for more are driving me to absolute distraction. Unfortunately, this seems to play into my minor obsessive/compulsive behavior patterns, and I am finding it hard to avoid monomaniacal brooding on it. Work is no distraction honestly, since I am sitting here bored and just browsing reddit. Since timecards for the month have already been filed, I am stuck here for my full day and I can't do something extra distracting like getting out on my bike...

So any suggestions on how to make it to day eight would be greatly appreciated!

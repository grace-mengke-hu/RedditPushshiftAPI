How to stop being addicted to nicotine gum?

Hi. I’ve actually never smoked. However, I am addicted to nicotine gum. I don’t even know how many I chew a day. My guess would be up to 10 pieces a day. I actually chew it. I don’t let it sit in my mouth. I’m realizing this is becoming a problem but I don’t know how to stop. 

Advice?

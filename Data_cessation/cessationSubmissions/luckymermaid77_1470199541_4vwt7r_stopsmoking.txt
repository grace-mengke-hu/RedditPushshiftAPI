I'm so embarrassed!

Day 3 (longest I've ever made it!) and everything of mine that I wore when I smoked stinks!! I never smoked in the house but I can still smell it on my clothes that I wore when I smoked. I can't believe this is how I used to smell. I'm feeling extremely embarrassed now. Yikes. Gross.

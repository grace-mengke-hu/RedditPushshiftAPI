1 month! I never thought I'd be able to make it!

I thought it would be super hard like it always is, I've failed many times. But this time around I was working out and had a goal in mind, to join the military. I had to quit if I wanted to be able to live the life I wanted.

But the ultimate reason why I was able to go so long was a reddit post I found on this sub. A guy talking about how when you smoke you're constantly looking for the next smoke you're going to have. It clicked, I've been revolving my live around smoke breaks/intervals. Now I've structured my life around self improvement and a reward now and then :)

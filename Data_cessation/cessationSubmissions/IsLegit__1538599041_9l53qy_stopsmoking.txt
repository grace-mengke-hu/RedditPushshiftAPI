I got 2 days and folded

This is long, sorry but I just want someone, anyone to know how I feel. 

Hey there, I'm a new poster in this community but I've been lurking and reading posts and was inspired to finally give quitting a go.

For a little bit of background, I started smoking last year sometime in September, just before my 17th birthday, in 8 days I will be 18 and I really just want to be free of goddamn cigarettes while I'm still young.

Two days ago I threw out my tabacco, skins, filters and lighters and tried to see how far I could go cold turkey. This was a bad idea. The reason being that in the past year I've slowly went from 4 a day to upwards of 15 a day and when I'm drinking I'm prone to blackouts, my friends have informed me that on some occasions that I've managed to get through 40 and the thought of that sickens me, I don't even have enough time in the day or money to smoke that amount.

So, one final box shall be rationed, I'll try to only have a smoke if I have really bad cravings and then hopefully when I turn 18 I'll be ready to quit, as I'll be legally old enough to buy my own the temptation will be super high, so managing to stay off them will boost my self confidence.

So, for my health, for my future and for my friends and family I will beat these damn tubes and pouches of addiction.

I'm proud every day of a new poster joining us in our fight to quit and maybe one day I can be proud of myself.

Keep it up everyone,

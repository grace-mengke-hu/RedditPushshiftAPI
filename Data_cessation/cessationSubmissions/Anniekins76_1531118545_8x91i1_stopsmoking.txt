Right, I can and I will do this but I could do with some help

Hey all! So I gave up back in February, something happened recently and I stupidly had “just one” cigarette... well I think we all know what happened... 

I desperately want to stop again so tonight it is. I’ve reread Allen Carr and am ready and raring to go. The only problem is that I haven’t told any of my friends or family that I’ve started again, so I have no-one to share my success with and it makes it much harder. I did give up last Saturday for four days and ended up smoking again, partly I think because no-one would know any different if I did, and I hadn’t been able to share my thoughts with anyone.

So I know how great you guys all are so I’m putting it here. Tonight will be my last cigarette and then I will be on here like a mad woman for the foreseeable future. I know how much your help makes a difference and also helping others.

Sorry to be such a bloody let down on my quit, but this next one will be FOREVER!

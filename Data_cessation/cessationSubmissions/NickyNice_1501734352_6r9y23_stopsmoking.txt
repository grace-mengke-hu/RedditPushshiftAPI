Been struggling lately with urges. (6 months)

Hello everyone,
  
Lately I have been struggling with some strong urges to smoke. Any input or advice you have is appreciated, just knowing that I'm not alone helps in a way.
  
I keep on having dreams where I just give up on quitting and tell myself I'll just smoke less (Which in real life I know if I chose to do that I would go right back to pack a day.) I loved smoking and I only stopped to try and better my health. Honestly, if I didn't have people that care about me, and I know would be disappointing in me if I went back, I would probably be smoking right now. That's really the only thing keeping mefrom going back, knowing how upset my dad, mom, and gf would be. But I can't rely on that alone to stay cig free, I need to find someway to get it out of my head.
  
Sometimes I think back, trying to remember how good smoking felt. I imagine holding a cigarette and I imagine the kick you get in your lungs when inhaling, this is when my cravings feel the worst. I keep on telling myself, "I wish I could just smoke again." I don't know why I do this to myself, thinking like this, but it keeps popping back into my head.
  
When I see someone smoking a cig, I really want to ask them for a drag, but I resist. I was with my sister today and she was smoking, it was really hard for me to resist asking her for a drag.
  
I know this post is kind of 'ranty', but I just want to talk about how I'm feeling with somebody.
  
Thanks in advance for your kind words.

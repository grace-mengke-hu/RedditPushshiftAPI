One Week!

Well today is officially my one-week anniversary! Improvements so far: better breathing (doesn't feel like Freddy Kreuger is clawing my throat every time I inhale); no wheezing; oddly enough I'm MORE relaxed (once I got through initial withdrawal...I was pure evil on Day 2); whiter eyes; smell better; circulation in my feet is improved; and I have TONS more time (even though I'm still figuring out how to fill it).

Going to see Muse tomorrow (woo hoo!) Paid $300 to be right under Matt Bellamy's nose, which I highly doubt I'll ever do again. Point is I was worried how I'd deal (concert=smoking/drinking under normal circumstances), but with these super-special seats my friend insisted we get, I highly doubt we'll be able to smoke anyways. So it works out I guess! :)

Stay smober, everyone!

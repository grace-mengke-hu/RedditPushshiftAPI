Today is the eve of the Big Day

Okay so this is my second major attempt at quitting. Obviously the first time didn't go so well, but I still lasted a week and a half. But yeah from Monday again, its my set day to quit, and I was just wondering is there anybody here who has some tips on how to make it stick? I know everybody is different, and different things work for each person, but just some general tips on how to make it through the day (as a college student my before and after class smokes with classmates are going to be missed), and more importantly, any tips on how to get through weekends out with friends, because they are the times that I truly have never been able to handle. Nights out have always been my downfall, its either smoke or don't go outside for me. So any general tips for getting myself through this would be greatly appreciated, I wanna seriously make it this time! Thanks guys.

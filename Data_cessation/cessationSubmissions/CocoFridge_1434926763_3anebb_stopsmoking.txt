My dreams predict the future

Hi! A kid in my teens here (16) and have been smoking for 6 months. Regularly aswell. Last night i had a dream that i got cought smoking by my dad, well it happened. He somehow smelled it on me that i had smoked. 3 hours ago. What. 
I take this as a sign, i told him i will try my darndest to stop it, i could see his dissapointment in his eyes. I tell you, this is not a good feeling. 
I know it takes a while to really get addicted and that im on the verge,  but it ends now.
Thanks for reading

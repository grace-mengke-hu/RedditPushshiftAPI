Help me quit smoking please!

Guys i know this sounds lame, but tihs is my first day trying to quit smoking, its only when im sick is when i really find smoking disgusting and this huge reality train hits me which is screaming "THIS WILL KILL YOU" "YOUR GOING TO DIE" and i really want to get back in shape and have more energy. But i feel like i cant focus on anything right now and im twitchy and super agitated. Also the long-term thought that i cant have another smoke ever again is soo scary and gives me huge anxiety i feel nude or in a dark abyss without my smokes!! HELP!!!

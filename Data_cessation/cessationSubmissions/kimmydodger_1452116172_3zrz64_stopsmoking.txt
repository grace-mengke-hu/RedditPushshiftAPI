Day 5 and dare I say it....

...cold-turkey has not been anywhere near as bad as I used to tell my smoking-self it would be!
This is my first attempt to stop after being poisoned by 20/day for more than 20 years. I've had a couple of clenched-teeth-cravings, but I laughed in the face of that adversity! If it's any use to those of us struggling, here would be my top tips so far:
* Ride the craving out (its just a bit uncomfortable, it's not going to kill you). 
* Don't drink coffee or alcohol (see above, this is what caused said cravings). 
* One day at a time, just think "today I'm not smoking, maybe tomorrow I will" (it seems less overwhelming).
* Don't inform smoker-friends how much they smell (it causes offense, apparently).  

Good luck, and be proud of yourself (I definitely am).

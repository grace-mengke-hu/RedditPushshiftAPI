Successfully overcame a very strong craving / urge yesterday night :)

So yesterday was the first night I went training after stopping. I usually had a couple of cigarrettes after coming home from training. 

I trained well yesterday, persevered and saw evolution in me. However, around 15 mins before the end of the training, I got a very strong urge to smoke. "You did well today. Have your shower, change clothes, go leave your backpack home and then there are still restaurants open with the brand of cigarrettes you prefer. You could just smoke one, or half". It was really overwhelming. I kept training and the urge was still there. When I got to the shower, suddenly it occurred to me: "This is really unpleasant. But you know how some time after training you feel muscular pain? It's sort of unpleasant, but it makes you happy as it shows that you're gaining a better condition. This is the same. You're not strong yet, but these are your "muscular pains" that show you're going in the right direction".

It did help. And when I got home, I put down my backpack and did not go out to buy tobacco, and I did not smoke :)


Update: had another urge today at work, less strong, before lunch. Lunch has helped and now I feel more focused :)

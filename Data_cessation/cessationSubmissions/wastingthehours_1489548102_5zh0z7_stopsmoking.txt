Quit yesterday

Been smoking since about 19, and going to turn 30 in about a week. I quit yesterday and have been smoke free for a little over 24 hours now. I've tried quiting a few times in the past but it never really stuck, but I'm going to do it for good this time. Tomorrow starts day 2 of a much healthier lifestyle!

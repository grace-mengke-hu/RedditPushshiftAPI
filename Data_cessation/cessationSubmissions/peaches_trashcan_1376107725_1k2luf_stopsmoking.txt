Day 3, Have some questions

Hey everyone!

I've been on vacation since Monday, and I haven't been able to sneak a cig since Tuesday night. I decided in advance I was going to try to quit this week since I already knew I wouldn't be able to smoke anyway as most of my family isn't aware I smoke.

So far, it's been pretty easy. I haven't felt any major cravings, and anything I have felt hasn't lasted more than 10 minutes or so. Sleep has been okay. I don't feel well rested, but I don't feel like a zombie in the morning either. I have noticed I'm a little more irritable than usual, but I've tried to be self conscious about it so I don't chew anyone's head off unwarranted.

But now I'm starting to freak a little bit. Vacation ends tomorrow, and I'm worried about messing up my progress. I've already made the decision to avoid alcohol until I feel confident. But I'm already making deals with myself like "you can have one on the way home from the airport and then just not smoke again for a few days."

Does anyone have any tips for sticking with it? I know I want to quit, and I know this is all just a nicotine trick, but I'm not confident in my self control. I feel like this is more than a "craving."

Also, what do you successful quitters do with your hands when driving now? That's one of my biggest smoking offenses.

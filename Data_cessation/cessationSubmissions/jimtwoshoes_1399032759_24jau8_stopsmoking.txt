Can someone explain why I always lose my shit and need to smoke after I drink a few beers?

Not much explaining really needed. I've quit smoking. I don't smoke. I don't think about smoking. I don't like carrying lighters in my pockets. I don't like the smell. I am happy without it in my life. 

If I don't drink, I don't smoke.

A few beers later and I am forking out for a packet of smokes, just for one cigarette. 

The amount of times I've woken up in the morning and thrown out almost full packs of smokes is astonishing. 

Someone please explain how this happens and how I can drink beer again as a non-smoker.

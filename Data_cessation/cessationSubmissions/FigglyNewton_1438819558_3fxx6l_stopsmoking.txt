DAY FRICKIN' 6 WWWWOOOOOHHHHHOOOO!!!!!!

Sorry, just a little excited :) Thank you, thank you, thank you everyone on this sub for making me feel the shitiest I've ever felt in my life!! I can't believe I've made it to day 6. I'm already feeling a lot better, and can finally see my way to beating this thing after 30 years. Tomorrow, (or perhaps in 15 minutes), I'll want to kill you all instead, so bask in my hell soaked appreciation while you can.

WWWWWWEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!

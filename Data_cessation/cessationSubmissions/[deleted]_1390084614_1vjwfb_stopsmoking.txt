The cravings are now worse than they were on the first day

It all went so well and then this. I'm just craving for cigarettes and even though there's no way I'm going to smoke one, I can't stand this feeling. I'm cranky, snappy and unpredictable, and I just hate it. How did it get suddenly this bad?! Since I hate being whiny, I'll just complain about this whole thing here.

This craving feeling, it's like someone poking my face, except there's no one to ask if the poking could stop, no one to hit right across their face because the feeling is so absurdly annoying. I can only hope it stops sometime. Only hope. 

It's really driving me nuts but I can't give in. Unless the doctor calls me and tells I only have a few months to live. Then I could just say fuck it and light a cigarette. (I seriously don't know if I wish for a random call from some doctor or not. This freaking feeling kills me.)

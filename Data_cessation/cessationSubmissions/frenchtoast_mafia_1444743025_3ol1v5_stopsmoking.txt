I fell off the wagon.

I started the cleaner way of life 2 weeks ago. I was very good I didnt smoke at all except 1 cigarette when i was drinkin. Yesterday i dont know why but i bought a pack. Now i feel horrible. Luckily the pack is gone now, but now i am jones-ing more then i did when i first started.

Smoking related dreams...experiences/input welcome

I quit smoking cold turkey on 1/16/18 so almost 3 months now. I'm M/26 and only smoked about 3-8 a day for 3 years. Things are great, I feel so much better and the cravings have long been quelled save for the occasional weak moment but I've come to far to give in at this point.

Anyways, I've noticed that lately I've had vivid smoking related dreams almost every night to the point where I wake up and feel guilty because I feel that I've smoked. It's not the end of the world but strange and kind of disconcerting at times.

Did you have these symptoms and how long did they last? I'm going on 3 months now of almost constant smoking related dreams. Thanks for your input.

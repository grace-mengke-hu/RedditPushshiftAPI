Looking for a quitting buddy

So I used to frequent here on another account years ago after attaining 568 days smoke-free, that was two years ago now. In that time I've quit, started again and quit again time and time over, sometimes for weeks, sometimes for months, often just for days.

The support of this forum was incalculable during my longest quit, I was very active and engaged at that time. I'm looking to quit very soon with the help of a buddy on here, one that I could keep updated with my progress and one that I could likewise help support and offer advice to.

If you're already long since quit, recently quit, or thinking of quitting soon and want a partner in the struggle, then I'd like to be your buddy. Having someone anonymous to fire a PM over to when the worst cravings hit would be very helpful for the both of us, especially if you're like me and keep your smoking hidden from most of the people in you're real-world support network, and don't want to involve/call on them for this, lest reveal your private struggle.

50% of smokers will die through the damage, either direct or indirect, of their addiction. 50%. Let us remember that and join each other in not smoking today and journey through it together.

Please PM me if you're interested, thanks.

11 days cravings begging to go away

Started smoking when I was 14 6 years ago and ended up on 25-30 a day at the age of 20 and it was then I realised I had to give up ! Started using the vapour cig and didn't smoke for 5 days then downloaded this app which I can't give enough praise, it was only after coming on ere and reading everyone's comments I felt confident enough to go cold turkey and that was 5 days ago ! From 30 a day to cold turkey just through reading other people's experiences ! Still getting cravings like mad but keeping water on me all the time and sipping away at that whenever I get a craving ! Chuffed with myself for doing this and the amount of money I've saved and how much better I feel is brilliant ! Best of luck to everyone trying to give it up hope all goes well !

Being cigarette but not nicotine free

I quit smoking after two years of trying to and im now 100% non smoker, like i never smoked pack a day. 

However i do smoke herb and after 2-3 months i agreed to blaze mixs just because we cannot afford to smoke it other way. 

Im really positive that if i wont be hitting wed ill be nicotine free, but is that really the case if im not doing it everyday?

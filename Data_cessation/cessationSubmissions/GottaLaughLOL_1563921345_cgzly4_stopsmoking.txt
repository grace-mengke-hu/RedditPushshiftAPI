REMINDER: Nicotine doesn’t relieve stress. It causes it.

A common thing quitters think about is “how else am I going to deal with my stress at work, home, etc, without cigarettes?” The truth is nicotine causes the stress. As Allen Carr in Easy Way To Stop Smoking explains it, the addiction to nicotine in your brain produces stress hormones when you haven’t smoked in a while. So don’t think of quitting smoking as letting go of something that is a good stress reliever but is harmful to the body. Think of it as being freed from from a harmful substance that ALSO causes stress in your life. Realizing the tobacco industries lies and tricks to keep you addicted makes it much easier to quit long term.

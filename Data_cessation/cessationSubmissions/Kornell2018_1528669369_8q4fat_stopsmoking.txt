How do i motivate myself?

I used to smoke 7 years, after quit for 3, and after started but only at social gatherings or weekends, basically 2 days a week.
I want to stop that as well...
How can i do it? I can't resist an urge to smoke when hanging out with friends. Is there a way to motivate myself? 
For example to save money every time i don't smoke on a weekend or something like that?

you are not cool

...although corrupted brains with an admirable knowledge in human psychology of gigant industry worked for decades to persuade you that those SNEAKY LITTLE ADDICTIVE NEEDY KILLING STICKS help you achieve your cool/chill/calm mode. SO. NOT. TRUE. This is my almost-one-year-of-freedom wisdom speaking to you/us all... my fellow Earthicans... YES YOU CAN. Every failure is just a proof that what we have here (&amp; is hard to admit is) addiction speaking/asking MOAR. You can do better. It is a process. Take your time. But do it. STOP.

Quit 3.5 years ago...scared today

I smoked a pack a day for about 10 years, from 18-28. Since I quit I've always felt random things in my chest, but never really thought much of it. I got in better shape, even ran a half marathon last year. 

I went to a new doctor Friday, and because I'm a former smoker, he wants me to get a chest x-ray just in case. 

I have no reason to think I have lunch cancer, as I've always felt things since I quit (and even before)...but getting an x-ray? Scary as hell. I'm terrified. I'm married now, have a great life...to think I might throw it away due to a dumb decision I made to smoke almost 15 years ago! It's infuriating. And terrifying. I'm getting the x ray tomorrow and will get the results Friday. 

If you're reading this, one day you'll probably go through this too. Trust me when I say it's not pleasant. Quit now and minimize the risk. Every day you don't smoke is a day more you can be an ex smoker. Right now I wish I had a lot more of those days.  


Edit - Thank G-d, I'm in the clear. Nothing wrong there at all. But if you're reading this weeks, months, years from now - quit now to avoid what I went through as much as possible. It was a very unpleasant experience, and I got lucky by only dealing with it for a week. It could've easily gone the other way, and I'll continue to get tested and go through this every few years for the rest of my life.  Every day I quit is another chance I have to not die of lung cancer, and it's great to know I've given myself a better chance to live a longer, healthier life. Please join me in that journey.

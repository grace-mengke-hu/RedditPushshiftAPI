Dealing With Work Breaks

Hi everyone.  I work in the resturant industry and I my biggest difficulty in not smoking is breaks at work.  I feel refreshed and energized once I finally get time to smoke and it makes the entire night easier.  I'm sure some of you can relate so I'm asking for ideas to deal with it.  I'm down to smoking about 5 cigs a day but I just want to stop and be done with it.  Any ideas?

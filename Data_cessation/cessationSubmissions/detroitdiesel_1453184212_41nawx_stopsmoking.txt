"Training" to quit

I've been quiting since July and tried a ton of different strategies over the years. The things I've learned is I have to tell myself "I'm done with this bullshit, I'm going to quit smoking." I'm doing this for me because I don't want to do it anymore, and it's truly what I want. Why continue to do something I don't want to do? Next everyone is different and there isn't any one way to do it, experiment and see what works best. Also I'm going to have to FORGIVE myself before I start. Like anything in life this is going to be a messy process, I am going to stumble and fall, A LOT. I can't beat myself up mentally or completely restart the clock every time at zero, negativity doesn't help and this is a part of the process. Notice the small improvements like how much I've cut down (from a pack to 10 a day, then 5) or how I went another day farther this time without the bastards. EVERY CIGARETTE I DON'T SMOKE IS A VICTORY. I just can't rest on my laurels, the end game is FREEDOM. It's like training to run a marathon, I'm training to be smoke free. This is the farthest I've been in a while and I feel confident and have momentum to carry on from everything I've learned along the way. Let's do this.

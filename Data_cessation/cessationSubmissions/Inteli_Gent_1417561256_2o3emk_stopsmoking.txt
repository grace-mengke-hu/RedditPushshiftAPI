This is a lot easier than it was in the past.

[Here's](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/2nqpt0/just_starting/) my first post.

The first two days were kind of painful, but it's been really easy every since. I don't want a cigarette at *all*. It's just not something I do anymore. I've tried quitting tons of times before, and it's never panned out, but this time, it's going so well that I've stopped talking about it, or putting it on Facebook or anything, because it barely feels like an accomplishment.

I have a wonderful woman (who may or may not end up read this, depending on whether she decides to stalk my account) to thank for it being so easy. She's reminded me what it is to be happy instead of just content, and since I met her, I've started exercising, cooking for myself, and I'm quit smoking, all on my own initiative.

Thanks for providing a place that people like me (and others that it might not be going quite as smoothly for) to voice their concerns and opinions. You guys rock.

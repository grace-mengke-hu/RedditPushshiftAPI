What to expect now

I am an 11-year smoker. I ended up at a pack a day maybe more for the last couple years. Stopped smoking Cigarettes 47 days ago.  I went on a trip to visit an old friend and my vaporizer stopped working. We drank all day and I ended up smoking around 7 cigarettes. It’s been 3 days since that happened and I haven’t smoked since. I am waiting on a new vaporizer to come tomorrow.    What should I expect after a relapse like that? Do I have to start all over? I don't know why I am writing this... This is kind of a confession and any advice you have would be appreciated too.

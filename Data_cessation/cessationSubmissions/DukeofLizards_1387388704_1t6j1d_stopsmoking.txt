Electronic cigs. Do they work?

So ive been smoking between 1-2 packs a day for 10 years. 23 now and i think its high time to quit. Tried cold turkey a number of times with no luck. How well do e-cigs work? Any brand you recommend? I see they are expensive and dont want one breaking. 

Thanks in advance!

The little things

This is my first winter as a non-smoker and Iâ€™ve noticed a couple of things. Iâ€™ve always worn gloves with the fingers cut off so I can smoke and now my fingers are freezing for no reason, time for some real gloves! I also see a lot of my co-workers and people in public in general freezing their asses off because they HAVE to have a cig, it reminds me how much control those little devils have on us and I feel bad for the people who havenâ€™t realized life is way better as a non-smoker! 5 1/2 months today and counting ðŸ˜Š

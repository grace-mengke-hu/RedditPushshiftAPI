This may be an unnecessary/repetitive question but, about the whole damage done thing?

To summarize, I began smoking around 21 and I'm sure that's a later age compared to most people, started casually before that with those cheap black and mild gas station cigarillos.  

Eventually around October 2013 I started gradually smoking cigs socially if I was out at a bar with people. For about two years after that I smoked about 10 a day and then managed to quit for 6 months. (Jan 2016 to June 2016) since then I'm up to about 15 to 17 a day. I'm about to turn 25 and intend to quit cold turkey. People claim if you stop for good especially while young you can reverse effects such as lung cancer and all that. My biggest fear is wrinkles early lol.  For those that have quit young or just quit in general at any age, what are your thoughts? Do you believe the studies claiming you can become as healthy as you once were again or am I being too optimistic? Sorry for a depressing post, I'm new to reddit. 

TL;DR I smoked for basically 3 years and am quitting soon, do you think it's damage done or do I have a chance to heal and feel better again? 

Thanks

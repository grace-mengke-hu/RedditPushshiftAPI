Can I trust StopSmoking percentages if I vape?

Title. Quitted tobacco a week ago, and it’s nice seeing the green healthbars in the Stop Smoking app getting bigger and bigger every day. But I didn’t stop completely, I just became a vaper. Can I trust those percentages? Am I healing, for example, my risk of a heart attack, or is vaping holding my lungs back in the healing process?

I show my friends my progress and they say that the numbers are not correct because I vape.

Stopped on my birthday, not a cig since. Is sleeping less(and feeling less sleepy) normal?

I've not smoked for a bit more than a week now and I think I reached the point where the worst is behind me. I'm much more "Awake" and I have trouble sleeping more than 4-5 hours a night. I feel fine, but is this common? I thought nicotine was supposed to be a stimulant, shouldn't I be more tired and sleepy? I'm on holiday right now but I'm afraid that when I return to work it'll mess up my sleeping schedule completely.

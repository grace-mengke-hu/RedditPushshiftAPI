8 days and ew those smells...

I've always had a great sense of smell...I was thankful that my cancer sticks dulled it. I quit 8 days ago though and the world stinks worse than ever...I can tell exactly which soaps my roommate uses while he is still in the shower...I walk into a store and I'm gagging on a perfume or cologne down the aisle. I drive around and smell burnt rubber and roadkill half the time I try to avoid leaving the house.

I know I cant be the only one but any advice or help?
Oh and smoke I can smell from quite a distance but I can mostly ignore it although occasionally I catch myself drooling...

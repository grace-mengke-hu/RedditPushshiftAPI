Im grateful for everyday that is smoke-free (177 days)

It was my new years resolution. My biggest motivation is how Ive felt the changes in my body. I feel amazing and Im sure it will keep on repairing itself. You dont know how smoking affects you until you go months without it, so dont give up after 2 weeks. Keep it up guys!

One Whole Year! Lessons and reflections

I started smoking regularly at 15. I smoked for over 20 years. Today marks the end of the first nonsmoking year of my adult life. This community helped me so much and I am so grateful. Below are some things I have learned:

**The Mental Game** 
In the past, any side effect of quitting smoking that I held in the back of my mind as unbearable, legitimate reasons to smoke were guaranteed  to happen at the level of unbearableness necessary to get me to quit quitting. My brain was like a toddler throwing a tantrum, but a smart one, aiming at the most efficient kind of tantrum to get its sweet, sweet nicotine back. This time around, my mantra was "No matter what symptom comes or how bad it gets, I will not smoke no matter what" and with that mindset quitting was far less painful than it had ever been on any previous attempt. This mental achievement was really boosted by a thought I first encountered on this sub: "Cigarettes don't cure any problems that they don't also cause" 

**Cravings sometimes come, but they always go** 
In the first few months, I had unpredictable cravings pop up. Day Six was the hardest for me. I got hit with an intense, very physical craving while in an art museum. Had I been at home, or somewhere where I could have bummed or bought, I might have smoked, but I just stuck it out at the museum. By the time I left the museum, an hour or so later, my craving level was manageable. All it takes is distracting yourself and letting time pass, and you can get through any craving. I used an app to count the time without cigarettes and when cravings were tough I would open that app and watch the seconds tick up--after day 6, it was never more than a minute or so before the craving would pass. 

Unexpected things would trigger cravings--changing seasons was a big one for me--but they were often more like ideas ('Oh, yeah, cigarettes are a thing that exists!') or muscle memories (reaching for nonexistent cigarettes at the traffic light closest to my house) than like those intense cravings that come early in quitting. I got pretty good at noticing those and letting them pass ('huh, I guess Super Bowl half time shows make me want a cigarette. Weird!')

**Everything is possible without cigarettes**
Long car trips. Coffee. Big spicy meals. Sex. Drinking. Meeting new people. I was worried all of these things would be impossible or ruined without cigarettes--come to find out, they're all possible and many of them are *better* than they were with cigarettes. My car doesn't smell terrible, and I'm not ashamed to give rides to nonsmokers. Food tastes better, coffee tastes better, and I have more stamina for sex. When I meet new people, I don't worry that I smell like an ashtray, or think about whether they'll think less of me when they find out I smoke (especially in networking situations).

**Body Conscious** 
I know some folks don't want to quit smoking for fear of gaining weight. Since I quit smoking, I lost more than 50 pounds (and counting). I worked at that loss--it's not like I just quit smoking and the weight fell off--but quitting really helped in a number of ways. Early in quitting, I noticed that eating until I was stuffed really made me want a cigarette, so I started aiming for eating portions that would leave me 90% full or so, just to cut down on the cravings. As the months ticked on, I got more and more confident in my own will power, and more and more interested in getting back in touch with my body. When I got serious about losing weight (about four months after quitting smoking), I knew I could stick to any diet I set my mind to (see above re: the mental game). I also found that exercise could be fun, not just red-faced, wheezing torture. And I discovered that, now that it wasn't just tantruming for nicotine, my body had some things to tell me about when/how much/what to eat to fuel it properly. I also learned the value of a supportive community from this place, and discovered /r/loseit which is an incredible resource. 

**Replace if it helps, but be honest about whether it helps**
I went cold turkey on the nicotine--I've found in the past that nicotine replacements didn't really help me much, and made me more vulnerable to relapse. A poorly adhered patch or an uncharged ecig sent me into the nearest gas station to buy a pack. I did smoke a bit of pot some evenings, to soothe the cravings for something scratchy in my throat and to even out some of the irritability and help me sleep. Pot never triggered tobacco cravings *for me*, but your milage may vary if you have a history of consuming both together. 

**TLDR**
I quit and everything is better now. You can do it, too.

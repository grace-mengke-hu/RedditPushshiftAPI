Quitting next week, have some questions for you

I've been thinking about quitting for a long time now, lurking around this sub and I've already made my mind about it, I just don't want to feel like crap anymore. I've made a pact with a friend to quit next Monday when he goes on a year long trip out of the country, we'll have our last cig on Sunday.

I know it's not going to be easy, I've been smoking 1.5 pack per day for a year, and a pack or less for 9 years before that. Now I want to focus on the positive so I'd like to hear the benefits you've felt while quitting, and specially the "timetable", ie. 

* when did you start smelling/tasting things? (this is one of the big things I'm looking forward to)
* when did you start feeling more energetic? Lungs/heart less "tired"? 
* I've heard that one of the big pluses is the sex performance improvements. Did you notice any changes? How long after quitting?

Any other benefits you care to mention would be great. I know everyone is different so I hope to get as many responses as possible. 

Also, any advice for things to buy or to do before quitting?

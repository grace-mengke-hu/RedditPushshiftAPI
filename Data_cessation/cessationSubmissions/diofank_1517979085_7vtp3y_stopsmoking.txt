In the mornings I still feel like I've smoked???

I've been a non-smoker for almost 2 weeks now, quit cold turkey. I've been working out a lot and felt great, not coughing at all. Still, when I wake up, every morning my lungs and airways feel like I've smoked like a chimney the night before. My lungs always feel clogged in the mornings and my mucous membrabes are super dry and it's almost hard to breathe in deep. Why is this and when does it go away?

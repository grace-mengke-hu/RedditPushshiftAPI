Day 1

I finally signed up for Reddit to participate in this sub.  I just wanted to thank any and everyone that posts their stories here.  It has been a huge motivator for me in the days leading up to this one.  I smoked my last cigarette a few minutes ago, and I crushed the remainder of my pack.  I am optimistic but also a bit nervous.  I know there are several of these posts already, but can anyone give me some helpful tips for the first 72 hours that helped you or that you wish you would have known prior to quitting?  Again, thanks for all the support!

27 hours.....feeling terrible.

I know quitting isn't easy but this really blows. 
I've been smoking 1 pack/day for nearly 17 years. I had my last cigarette 27 hours ago and I'm actually surprised I've made it this far. Currently experiencing waves of hot sweats, anxiety, restlessness and feeling mentally scrambled. What a mind fuck. I hate cigarettes for this but want them soooo badly. Is it overly dramatic to use the word anguish here? 
When do I start feeling better? 
Ex-smokers of reddit, how long did it take to feel like you had won?

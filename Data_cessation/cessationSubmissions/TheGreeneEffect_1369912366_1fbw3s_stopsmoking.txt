Dream smoking?

It's been almost three weeks and I feel like I'm past the physical withdrawals. Last night I dreamed I smoked a cigarette and immediately got angry at myself for doing so. Then I awoke. I have never had that happen before, but it seems that my subconscious is also aware that I'm quitting.

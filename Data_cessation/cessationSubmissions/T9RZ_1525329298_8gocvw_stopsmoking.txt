I thought I had crippling anxiety, but I'm just a drug addict

**If you have mental issues, please DO seek professional help. This is just my experience.**

I was reading Allen Carr's The Easy Way to Stop Smoking and it really resonated with me. It wasn't magic. It's still not easy. But I can see a life without cigarettes now. This morning I had to bring my car to the mechanic and normally I am a sweating mess whenever I have to do anything out of my routine. My stomach and chest tighten I up. I have trouble speaking and breathing. So obviously I smoked like a chimney to calm down. Guess what? The cigarettes were causing that feeling in the first place. I drove there without any anxiety. I talked to the guy confidently. It was no big deal at all. It really made me realize how cigarettes don't solve anything, but cause a lot of problems in the first place. 

Tuesday and Wednesday I was a sweating mess because all I wanted was a cigarette. After reading this book I realize I am not losing anything. I still have a long way to go, but for the first time in my 8 years of smoking I am confident that this time I can really do it. I urge you to give it a try, it really helped me.

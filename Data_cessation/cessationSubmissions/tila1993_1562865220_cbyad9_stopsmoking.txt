First Week

Hi my name is Tyler and i quit smoking on Tuesday. My wife thinks I quit a year ago. I got really good at hiding the smell. I finally decided that I had enough hiding it and just wanted to give it up. I've never had withdraws to say of I just get grumpy for about 15 minutes then I'm past it. I have tried to quit multiple times. The toughest part for me is talking to my coworkers when they're on break (most of them smoke). I find myself wanting to bum one which has happened quite a few times in the past. Smoking while driving was never really a thing for me I preferred to chew when I am driving to avoid the smoke smell in my cars. That has been the hardest part for me. Every time I get behind the wheel I want to stop and get a can and a pack for the road does anyone have any good hobbies to help keep me occupied in the meantime? I want to quit so I can be around for my future children.

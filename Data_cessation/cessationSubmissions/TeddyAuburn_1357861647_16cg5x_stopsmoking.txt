Just like that, a month has passed. 

I was surprised to see how much time had gone by!

I made it through the holidays, with no shortage of cravings. Social and situation triggers be damned. 

I also started seeing a new guy; he is a social smoker. He was being very nice by not smoking around me during the first few weeks. When he took me out for drinks the other night he mentioned that he was craving one. So I asked around and it's not hard to find a smoke in a gay bar. We then walked hand in hand, and I was able to hold my own. Kissing him afterward was another story, but he kept me strong. 

Thanks for all of your support guys, I hope that I can offer the same kindness!

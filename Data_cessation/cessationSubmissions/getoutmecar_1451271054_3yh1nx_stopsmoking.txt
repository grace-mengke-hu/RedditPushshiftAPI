i'm back.

So i'm back. When they say don't even have one cigarette, boy do they mean it. I was smoke free for over a year, then I started going out with my co-workers for breaks. They smoked, I was around them. Then I had one cigarette, one turned into two, two turned into me buying a pack and now here I am. I'm ready to quit again.

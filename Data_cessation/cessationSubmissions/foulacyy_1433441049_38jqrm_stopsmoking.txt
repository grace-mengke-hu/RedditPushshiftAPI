FREEDOM

I don't know what the fucks up honestly, but in the past i've tried to quit and its been super fucking brutal. But this time, not so much. I mean, i've had intense cravings and urges but they're not unbearable, but when a craving isn't happening i don't even think of smoking. Has anyone experienced this? like i threw my cigs out 9 days ago and said fuck that i'm done and i'm done for good and i
ve had a pretty easy time so far. 

i guess my question would be, were there any points you felt this way just to have the reality that you were a smoker come crashing down on you with like an intense crippling desire to smoke?

idk just ranting. FUCK CIGS. LOVE MY DOG TODAY.

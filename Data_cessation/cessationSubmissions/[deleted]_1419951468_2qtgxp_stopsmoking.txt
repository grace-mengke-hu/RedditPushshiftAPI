And I am still experiencing smoking in my dreams. Last night, I dreamt that I was using every opportunity I had to light up. What frightened me the most was that the cigarettes made me feel good. I don't remember them ever having that effect in real life, yet I woke up wanting one. The only reason I didn't give in is because I thought of the people I would be hurting, including myself. I hid my smoking and that made it worse, and I don't want to go back to sneaking around and making excuses.

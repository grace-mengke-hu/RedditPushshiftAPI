I need help

I've been trying the patch and this day 4. The temperature here isn't too bad, low 90s, but the patch is sweating off each day.

In the mornings I have been doing fine. At lunch, I go home and take my dog for a bathroom break and eat. Afternoons at work have been much harder for me. When I get home I see the patch has moved from where it originally was.

In the morning, I was fine to go without a cigarette but once the patch slides I can't think of anything else but smoking.

Does anyone have any advice how to keep it as effective in the heat? Thank you.

It's easier this time.

Hey all! I'm on Day 3 of this quit and I'm feeling very positive and optimistic that I'll be able to stay the course.

The lost time (back in July) I felt really miserable nearly the whole time and was really focused on that. This time, I told myself that this is a no-brainer. It's all positive and there are no downsides to stopping. So when people have asked, "How's it going?" I resist the urge to say I feel weird and crazy and irritable. Sure there are fleeting moments like that, but for the most part I feel healthier already and proud that I'm doing the right thing after smoking regularly for something like 15 years.

It's hardest at work, when I'd use smoke breaks to get outside for a few minutes and get myself psyched to work on a not so exciting project. I'm trying to supplement that stimulation with a little more coffee. But I know I'm going to get through it this time, and eventually things will settle back to a new normal.

Yesterday I went to the Dr. for a check up. The nurse asked if I was still a regular tobacco user. I said no! And then laughed and admitted I'd only quit the day before. The nurse didn't miss a beat and said, "Great! Now we can put you down as a former smoker." That felt so good! Thank you, Nurse, for believing in me!

Onward and upward!

big test tomorow and I'm anxious

I gave up using champix last Oct, I lasted 5 weeks, had a bad day and bought 20, I thought it's ok I gave up once this is just a blip, I smoked the 20 in 4 hrs thinking when they're gone they're gone, a week later I did the same again, I made promises to myself ie I will not buy cigs for one week (I did that at 2am one morning and 1 week later I stayed up until 2am then went to a 24hr and bought more). Then it was, get xmas over etc etc etc I hated myself and I couldn't even ask for help as everyone thought I'd still given up and I was smoking in secret. 

Nine days ago I read Allen Carr's book, it made pefect sense but I was in the middle of a promised buy no fags for 2 days, so I only had 4 left to smoke while reading the book, I felt cheated and 6 days ago I bought 40 and read the book again puffing like a chimney, at the end I happily put out my last ever fag. I'm still happily a non smoker, and I know I don't want one, however my biggest smoking 'pleasure' was when driving and I have a 3 hr trip tomorrow, in another country and on my own. I'm already stressing about it, what will I do instead of smoking? for 3 hours? I'll go mad?
Smokers and ex smokers will know where I'm coming from, I know myself it's stupid but I can't help it

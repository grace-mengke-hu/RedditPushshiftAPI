I decided to quit last night, but I smoked on the way to work.

I always smoke two cigarettes on my drive to work in the morning. I've been wanting to quit for a while and last night I made the decision to go cold turkey since patches, gun, and zyban all failed to help at all. I feel pretty confident that I can quit. I know I'm capable, but at this point the hard part is just telling myself it's going to work and just putting them down, since they're just so much of a part of my routine. Is there a trick to this? How can I just nut up and take the first step.

I'm telling myself that I'm not going to smoke on the way home. I felt like crap about the cigarettes (and because smoking in the morning has started to make my chest hurt). I don't want it anymore, but I worry that reflex is just going to keep kicking in and I'm going to keep being weak.

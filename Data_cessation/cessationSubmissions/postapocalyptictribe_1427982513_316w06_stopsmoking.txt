Smoking dreams

So it's been three months and some change since I last had a cigarette and the cravings have almost completely disappeared. It's just very rarely that I still get a niggling desire to smoke, but it's pretty easy to dismiss it. 

But I still keep having smoking dreams. And every time I have one I wake up feeling hugely guilty about it. I'd say I've had at least two of these dreams a week since I quit and each time I'm just going about my normal routine, happily smoking. Morning coffee and a cig, after dinner and a cig, reading a book with a cig. Just normal life... with cigarettes. 

However last night I had a dream and I was with my cousins (who smoke) and we were sitting down watching tv and smoking. 

I looked down at my cigarette and said, "What the hell is this? Who gave me this?"

My cousins just looked at me like I was crazy and I started crying and said something like, "Why would you give me this? I had 100 days clean! Now what am I going to tell (husband's name) and (daughter's name)?!?!" 

And I threw the cigarette down on the ground and stormed out of the room and woke up sobbing. 

I don't know, I just wanted to share. Maybe the smoking dreams are going to stop soon. I hope so.

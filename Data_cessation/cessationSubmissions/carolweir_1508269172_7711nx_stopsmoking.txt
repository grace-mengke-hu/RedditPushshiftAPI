Tough day :(

I was so positive yesterday and then an inconsiderate colleague who knows I am now a non smoker decided to offer me a cigarette. Low or what.... I didn't take it and wouldn't. But just so frustrated by how this persons mind works. 
It's hard enough walking into work and going past the people smoking outside. 
Day 9 peeps and saved enough to treat myself to something nice :)

Dangers from a year of smoking for someone who had childhood asthma?

So I made a very poor decision to start smoking in my thirties for a year, and I’m just trying to stop now. 

However, since I had asthma as a child, I’m wondering/freaking out that I may have developed COPD or emphysema. 

Or is “just a year” okay, even with asthma, and if I quit now I’ll likely be okay?

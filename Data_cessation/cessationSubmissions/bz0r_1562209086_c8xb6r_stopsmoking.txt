Newly quit - what’s up with this terrible cough?

I have been smoke free for about 5 days.  I have developed this terrible, rattling cough.  I’m not coughing up anything.  It’s dry and deep and it has started just yesterday.  It’s one of the worst coughs I’ve ever had in my life!  Has anyone ever experienced this?

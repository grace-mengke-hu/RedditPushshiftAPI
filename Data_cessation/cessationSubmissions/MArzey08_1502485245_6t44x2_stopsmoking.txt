2 Hours left of Day 5!

Hi all,

Firstly, I'm new to the Sub and haven't posted on Reddit in a loong time, so apologies for any errors! 

Anyways, today is day 5 of quitting smoking and I feel awesome. Definitely going to keep it up! 

The cravings still pop-up now and then, but I'm managing them pretty well with exercise and sugar-free chewing gum! 

What I want to know is this; does anyone else receive little to no praise/support from those close to them?

I've tried to quit so many times and have told all of my family/friends every time and now they don't seem to believe me that I've actually managed to get it under control this time, nor do they seem to be that interested.

I mean, I can understand that it must be like listening to a broken record and frustrating every time I said "This is it" only to start again, usually within 24 hours of "quitting".

Anyway, I feel damned good and anyone else that is thinking of quitting, you definitely should. It's hard, but holy shit does it feel good!

2 hours and it'll be the start of day 6 for me!

Words of encouragement from a recently smoke free individual.

Hello all!  First time poster long time lurker here. Just wanted to give a few words of encouragement to anyone who is wanting to quit, has relapsed, or has already done so. Regardless of how you choose to do so; whether it be with stop smoking aids, ecigs, or cold turkey, remember that **You can do this!**. I can tell you as a smoker of 1.5 PAD Marlboro Reds for a combined decade and a half it isn't easy. That being said I am now 2 months 100% smoke free. I still have a nicotine addiction, but with the help of ecigs have cut my nicotene intake dramatically. Started at 24mg and as of now am at 12mg. I can tell you that despite still puffing on ecigs I no longer have the breath of painful air first thing in the morning. I do not feel like i always have something in my throat anymore.  Circulation has returned in a way I haven't experienced since I was a teenager!  I can now smell things and taste things the way I am supposed to!  It's a completely different world :). I know I'm a newcomer, but believe me when I say Ive suffered the hardships of cigarettes and its liberating to know I'm rid of them forever. Good luck to each and every one of you. You can do it!

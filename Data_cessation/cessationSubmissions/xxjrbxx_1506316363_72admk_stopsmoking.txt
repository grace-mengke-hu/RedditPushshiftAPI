37 Days quit and experiencing tightness in the chest. Also minor dizziness.

I have been smoke free for 37 days and couldn't be prouder of myself.   However for awhile now I feel this dull pain in the center of my chest and to the left a little.  The best way to describe it is that it feels like there is a fist in my chest and it's getting bigger slowly.

I am 31 years old with a history of panic and anxiety, but honestly it doesn't feel like any panic I've had.  The sensation in my chest does induce panic, though and I get a little light headed and dizzy.

I'm considering taking a trip to the emergency room tomorrow just to be safe.  I'm not having any issues breathing.  In fact my breathing is better than ever.  No wheezing, coughing, or anything.

If anyone has any insight as to whether this is normal healing process, I would like to hear it.  Any information at all will be greatly appreciated.  Good luck everyone in kicking the nasty habit.

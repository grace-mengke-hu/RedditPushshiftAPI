Itchy skin, canker sores.  I've read this is normal for some people. It's driving me crazy

Also, my badge should say 10 days now :(. I'm not getting the urges like I did last time I quit.  I wake up feeling great, have had tons of energy throughout the day, and love my new lungs.  Not being able to chew food properly and scratching all day is getting quite annoying, however.

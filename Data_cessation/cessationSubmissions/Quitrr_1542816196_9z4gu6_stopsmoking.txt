Holidays and Weekends

It's Monday and I am pumped. I have planned this quit date for a few weeks. The first day kinda sucks, but I don't give in. The second and third day are almost unbearable. I think about cigarettes every few minutes. The fourth day is almost as bad as the third and the fifth day is almost as bad as the fourth. It's finally the weekend or a holiday as the case might be. Hooray! I have made past most of the physical withdrawals. I think we should celebrate! My brain offers a suggestion. "How about a cigarette? We always celebrated with one of those in past. You proved you can do it. Look how well we did. Just a couple won't hurt. We can always just quit again on Monday." DON'T LISTEN. This is your addiction trying to sabotage your quit. I have fallen for this trap on too many of my quits in the past. We can make it past this holiday and weekend! Thank you all. I am thankful for this sub!

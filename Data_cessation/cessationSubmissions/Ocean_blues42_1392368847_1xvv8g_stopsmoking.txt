Day 3. Strange symptoms.

Hello, gentlemen. This is not my first attempt on quitting, yet so far i'm having the most ridicilous withdrawal symptoms:

1. My dreams are fucked up beyond my describing skills. 
2. I am performing reality checks every hour just to be sure i'm not dreaming. 
3. I'm sweating like a bloody pig (not a sweaty guy in general) 
4. My brain freezes 5-6 times/hour for 10-20 seconds denying responsibility to process information. I can be mid-conversation and suddenly shut off without even finishing a word, i shit you not. 
5. On a good side, i don't even want a cig anymore.

I quit cold turkey, so this shit is not a side effect of drugs. Anyone ever experienced something like this?

Need to develop faith in myself

It wouldn't be far off the mark to say this is my 50th (or more) quit. I am on day 3 and feel as committed as I usually do.

Then at some random point between now and day 20 I throw in the towel with very little struggle or resistance on my part.

With the support of this community, I hope to develop more of a backbone and succeed. 

Regards,
Peter

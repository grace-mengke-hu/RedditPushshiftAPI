Smoker from age 15 to age 24. How much damage have I done? (Day one)

I picked up smoking at 15, smoking about 3 cigarettes a day for two years or so. My habit has waxed and waned over time, never more than a pack every other day but never less than the three or four daily. How much damage, irreversible or not, have I done to my body with this 9 year habit? Will quitting in my early twenties help reverse some of that damage? Happy to be quitting TODAY.

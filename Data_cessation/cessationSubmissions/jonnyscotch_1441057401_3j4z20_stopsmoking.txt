Long time Lurker, First time Quitting. FOR REAL!!

Hey been on this site for a few years. Kindof half ass quit a few times but it only ever lasted a day or less. This time it's for real.

Ive been smoking for 10 years now and I'm 27. 8 of those years have been around a pack a day. It's not the money that's making me quit its the health. Last few months I've had a slew of health issues pop up, unrelated to smoking but it sure can't help. Last night I started having chest pains when I was out for a smoke and I said that's it!!! I'm tossing the rest and I'm done!!

Plus it's a perfect time to quit, I just got my wisdom teeth out today, and I want it to heal well so good bye smokes!!

Just realized I still have to throw out my nicotine e cigarettes juice... I'm goin cold turkey this time! 

It's been over 15h and it's not bad actually. I am actually fed up with smoking so I really have no desire to. Need to stop this essay now it's too easy to blab lol.

TL/DR: first post, quitting cold turkey, 10 yr smoker. Quitting for health reasons.

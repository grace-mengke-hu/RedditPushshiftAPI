Day 1 - We can do this!

Today marks Day 1! I'm so, so sick of this habit. 

It's disgusting, it's poisonous, it's expensive, it stinks.

I've tried quitting many times in the past, but this time it just feels like this is the one! I know some of you won't properly class it as quitting, but I've just invested in a brand new, good quality vape, and I'm hoping the mindset of spending so much money upfront will make me think to not want to then spend even more money on cigarettes, even though just the vape on it's own is still 1/3 cheaper than my monthly spend on cigarettes. 

Any words of encouragement will be very useful, and anyone who is also quitting today feel free to let me know and we can team up and slay this monster for good!

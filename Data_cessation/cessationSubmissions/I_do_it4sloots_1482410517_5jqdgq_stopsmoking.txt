I keep relapsing at parties or saturdays out

I just see other ppl havig a great time and smoking and i think smoking makes you stay young and not smoking makes you a humorless conservative that thinks life is all about being serious. Obviously i cant isolate the smoking on the night but chainsmoke and go full gas on the next day

Advice?

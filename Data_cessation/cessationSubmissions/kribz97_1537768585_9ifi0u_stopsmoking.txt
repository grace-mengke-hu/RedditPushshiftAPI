Dreams or maybe even nightmares?

Do you guys also had dreams about smoking? Im trying to quit since 1st September, there were better and worst days but Im clean from 14th, completely. So its 10 days now, and I had a dream about smoking second time already. I dont remember much about this dream but I know that I was terrified that I will start to smoke again. I was really scared. And when I woke up I was so so happy that it was just a dream
Is it normal? Has anyone else got that kind of situation?

Hold on Be strong.

I want to contribute to the encouraging posts here. Today was tough for me, still is. The past couple of days i have had strong cravings. I even planned out today to go to the corner store to grab a pack. I will not do it. I am 4 months in. Soon enough it will be a year. I can do this. it's such a huge challenge, seems impossible sometimes but if i can keep going then i know i am a strong ass person who's not to be fucked with! Believe in yourself guys! We can all do this and come out so strong. I appreciate this community very much ❤️ it brings me to tears sometimes how thankful i am for you all. Keep fighting

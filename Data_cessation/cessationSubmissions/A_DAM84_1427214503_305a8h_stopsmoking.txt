Quick question, opinions welcome.

I forgot to remove my badge, I started smoking again about a year ago and quit 6 months ago so should be around 150 days. I am vaping this time around instead of quitting cold turkey. I was just wondering if smokers would find it weird if I joined them in smoking areas and smoked my e-cig? I remember always enjoying conversations when I smoked and lately when I go out or at work, I don't join smokers and usually just puff in the bathroom or something like that which I don't see being a good thing in the long run.

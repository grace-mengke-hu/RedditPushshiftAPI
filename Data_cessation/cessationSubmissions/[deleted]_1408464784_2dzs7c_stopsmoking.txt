Long Week.

I quit last Monday, the day that my grandmother died. I took my pack out of my pocket at work, broke them and tossed them. The three packs that I had at home went to my friend. 

I drove back to my hometown for her funeral. I was assaulted by my father on Wednesday night, prior to the service. It had been a long time, and this was a bit different. I'm actually fairly certain that I would have been killed if he hadn't been pulled off.

I broke up with my girlfriend of a year fairly recently. She's seeing someone, which I found out on Saturday.

There was more, but these are the big ones. Without being overly dramatic, it was the worst week of my life so far.

And I still didn't smoke. I'm bigger than these cravings, than my habit and so are all of you.

A question to those who quit smoking and go to the gym.

Good morning r/stopsmoking !

My question is to those of you who quit smoking and go to the gym; since you have quit smoking, have you seen any difference in your performance at the gym, both strength wise or cardio wise?

I've recently signed up the British Army, and obviously I need to be very physically fit. Although currently I'm smoking around 7 a day, and I can pass all the requirements needed to be able to join. But I was wondering how much of a difference it would make if I quit smoking? Have you personally found it easier to run longer, breathe better or lift more etc.?

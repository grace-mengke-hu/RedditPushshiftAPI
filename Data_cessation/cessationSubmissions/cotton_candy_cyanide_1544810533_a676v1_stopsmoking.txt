How do I support someone who just quit smoking?

Hi. So my boyfriend is - was is more appropriate? - a heavy smoker. He’s been smoking for more than four years now. There has been attempts to quit but it never really worked out. The longest he went without smoking was, I believe, a month.

He decided to quit altogether today. It’s been a few hours since he made the decision and he’s already cranky and craving for a cigarette.

I want to support him and help him through with this, but I’m not sure how. Can someone please give me some tips? I don’t smoke myself and I don’t really associate myself with smokers either.. except for this guy. 
TIA

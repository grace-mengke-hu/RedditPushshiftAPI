Damnit. Reset.

I can't believe I just did that. Why.

I'm an addict. I am always going to be in recovery.

I think I may have to quit drinking. If a couple of drinks can make me undo the positive life change I had (11 days no nicotine.) then it is something that will NEVER benefit me.

My entire family is addicts. I break the cycle today.

Since my last drink and smoke:: 2 hours and 11 minutes.

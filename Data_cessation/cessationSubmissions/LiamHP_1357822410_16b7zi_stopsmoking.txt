400 days

It's incredible to look back on these 400 days and think of all the moments I didn't smoke.  How it used to be so common and easy to light up, and it was just a part of my life.  It's funny to remember how hard I thought it would be to quit that I wouldn't even try.  I did quit.  Life went on.  I'm still in a great relationship with an amazing woman.  I'm making more money at work.  I'm happy and healthy.  Everything is pretty much the same, except I don't smoke, and of course the benefits that come with that.  I can't believe I let those death sticks take such a hold on my life.  The other day, I was working hard with a new co-worker.  Break came and he pulled out a pack and offered me one.  I didn't say that I used to smoke and quit.  I didn't preach to him.  I simply said "No, thanks" turned my head, looked off in the distance and smiled the hugest smile I've ever smiled.  Life is good.  Keep on smiling non-smokers!

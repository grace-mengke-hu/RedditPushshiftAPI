Something that's helped me; may help you too

One thing I've noticed in the way I had been talking to people and also seeing on this sub is the way people referring to their quit as "trying" to quit. I've tried to quit so many times and this time I have decided that I am no longer "trying" to quit. I have quit. 

This change in thinking has really helped me in sticking with it rather than subconsciously giving myself a way out. Maybe this will help some of you too!

Falling off the Horse (and getting back on)

Everything was going so well, i was 6 months into a new quit attempt and it was great. The black shadows at the corner of my mind had dissipated. I was calmer and happier. I had started smoking green again (after an initial hiatus- no tobacco) and was really enjoying it again.

I met up with some friends at a bar and they passed me a J. it looked a little big but the dude normally rolled pure so i figured what the hell and took a toke. It tasted awful and didn't really do anything. I could taste the acrid filth of the tobacco.

Then it started slowly, like a tap dripping. I became more relaxed about smoking pure. when we were in a group they would all roll with tobacco and it was fine because i wasnt "smoking" tobacco (it just happened to be in there too). By about week 3 i started putting tobacco in my own personal J. I rationalized it that it would make it last longer and save me money. By week 4 i realized there was a problem. I would put more and more tobacco in and just sprinkle other stuff on top. 

So it took me 4 weeks to go from 100% pure to 99% tobacco. Week 5 i started smoking cigs again.

That was 2 months ago now and its time to get back on the horse. 

TLDR: if you let that monster back in it will take over. Dont smoke tobacco EVER AGAIN and you will be fine

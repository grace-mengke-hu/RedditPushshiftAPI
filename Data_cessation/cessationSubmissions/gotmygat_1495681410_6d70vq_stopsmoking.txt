Been smoking Dokha for over 3 years!

Been going through some very rough times in the past three years.... started out with one bowl of dokha and my bottle would last  me almost half a year at a rate of one bowl a day. It then become two bowls, first thing when I wake up and first thing before bed. This year i would finish half a bottle in 3 months at a rate of 5-7 bowls a day and it stopped becoming about getting the infamous dokha buzz and more about the nicotine that I need.


I now am trying to stop this madness with this very very addictive drug. 

It's so bloody hard !!!!

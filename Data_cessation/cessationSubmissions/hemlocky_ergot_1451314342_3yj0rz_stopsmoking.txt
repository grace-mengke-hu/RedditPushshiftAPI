Advice re Anxiety

About 6 months ago I was able to quit nicotine (vaping and cigs) but relapsed over Christmas.  I've noticed that my anxiety and hunger has gone way down. 

How do you cope with your nicotine addiction morphing into a eating addiction?  It really sucks because the cigs really do help with my stress levels and I am considering gum/patches but I'm just not sure. 

I still have almost a whole pack of cigarettes in my car and it seems like a waste to throw them away but that's such a slippery slope.  Plus the benefits of it helping with my stress is good but I've also enjoyed the increased lung capacity I have. 

Any advice would be appreciated.

People who have quite for well over a year? Does it get better? Can you go out and drink with friends who all smoke and not want one?

I quit for 3 months back in the day (cold turkey) and I remember not wanting a cigarette anymore or even thinking about them anymore, but my anxiety was still at an all time high.... I went to a music festival and was out in a forest for 3 days and had a cigarette. 

When does that stop?

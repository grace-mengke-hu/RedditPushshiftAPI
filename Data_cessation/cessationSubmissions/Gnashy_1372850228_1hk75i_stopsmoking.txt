"If I Can Do It, Anyone Can"

I've noticed people saying that a lot, hell I've said it.  I think this is something to take note of for new quitters, and more importantly, people who want to quit but are too afraid to try because they think they'll fail or that they could never do it.

The fact that so many of us can say "If I can do it, anyone can" just proves that we have felt the same sadness and fear you feel when you think about quitting and decide not to. We've thought we were so addicted that we could never give it up, that we had no willpower, that we shouldn't bother trying because we would just fail.

But look at the badges of people who say this.  Anywhere from one day to two hundred.  We got past that self-defeating attitude somehow.  Everyone has a different success story - some of us used Chantix or patches, e-cigs for some, some of us read Easyway, and others used incentives or just plain did it.  

The point is, if you think you can't quit smoking, you're wrong.  Almost everyone here has had that thought before but we overcame it and so can you. 

 This is the nature of addiction.  It's hard sometimes, more so for some than others, but it's doable.  Don't be afraid - you might suffer some, but once you've made it through, it's totally worthwhile.  And then when you're done you can say "If I can do it, anyone can".

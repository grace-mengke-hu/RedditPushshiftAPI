I need some ideas!

Ok guys need a little help here. I quit about 2 months ago after a health scare and am still going strong. Of course I gained 10 lbs, and let me tell you I didn't have the extra 10 lbs to spare. But that's what happens when you replace smoking with food. Worth it but still sucks. One of my worst triggers is break time - I work hard at a stressful job, a quick smoke or a little snack is just a perfect little break that doesn't subtract too much from my productivity, helps me feel rejuvenated, and able to get right back to work. What do you guys do for a break now? What can I replace my smoke / snack break with that will be equally rewarding and I can look forward to as much?

I keep quitting and I'm not sure if it's working.

Trying to control my triggers but sometimes my partner and I get into a tilly that pushes me over the edge. This usually happens after a long day when we're both exhausted from school [we're both middle school teachers] and I have little to no willpower saved up to help keep myself away from a pack. I've been able to really keep myself from a full relapse, however, by just telling myself that even if I bought a pack in anger all I have to do is throw it out and I can start again. Relapses happen, and I'm helping find new ways to deal with this particular trigger, but where I used to just give in to a relapse as soon as it happens, I'm determined not to let that happen again. 

TL;DR: keep relapsing, but never letting it become a full relapse. You can always start again. Don't give up after one misstep.

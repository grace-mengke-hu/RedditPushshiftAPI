Relapsed just after NINE days. Help?

Here's a quick background, I've been smoking for the past 4 years. (I'm 21 now) And I've been seriously thinking about quitting smoking. I was able to survive a week of smoking before but I'm reconsidering my life decisions now since I got sick.

I decided to quit because I had this horrible cough that lasted for more than a week. (I also had two upper respiratory tract infections that I had to cure with prescription medicine)

I've been having trouble with this addiction and I think the internet would be a great way to reinforce my decision to stop smoking because of the various experiences of people here.

Even if I relapsed even with just one cigarette, I'll start quitting again tomorrow and get back in the saddle. If I don't, I'm afraid I might become a full blown half-pack smoker again.

So today will be my firat day of quitting! Any suggestions on what to do when I get the urge to start smoking again?

I usually get the urge to smoke when:
1. I see people smoking.
2. I inhale their second hand smoke.

I need all the help I can get.

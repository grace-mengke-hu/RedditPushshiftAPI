Discouraged

I feel like I've tried everything. I've read the books and used the lozenges and gums. I don't think the e-cig will help me because it still feeds my addiction in the same way but I will still want to smoke cigarettes with it. I guess I could try patches, but it just seems to prolong everything. 

I have failed so many fucking times. Instead of getting better at  quitting it seems like I am just getting better at relapsing. I've quit about 12 times in just the last year. I had a run of 54 days last summer but can't make it more than a week since then. It makes me feel like such a fucking worthless slave to nicotine.

I'm way to anti-social to pick up the phone and try one of those hotlines, it just makes me want to smoke thinking about it. 

Either I'll spend the rest of my life trying to quit or it will just fucking kill me. I don't even care about the badge anymore it just demoralizes me. I've got two fucking days.

My little timer says 3 days

Quittin' cold tofurkey :D (lolololol veg jokes)

Current status: tons of extra energy, getting back up to my old running schedule, a little uncomfortable being touched (like my body is sort of irritable), got a little app that tells me how many dollars I've saved, got into sunflower seeds - which are great fun.

Y'alls sub has solid, succinct advice. Thanks!

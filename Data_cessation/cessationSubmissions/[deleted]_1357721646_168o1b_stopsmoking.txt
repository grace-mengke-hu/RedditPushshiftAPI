How do I help keep my boyfriend motivated?

He recently quit smoking, or rather, he started exclusively using an electronic cigarette. He only refuses cigarettes because I don't want him to smoke, though, and I'd like his reasoning to go beyond me. I want him to genuinely be motivated. How can I help him see that quitting really will improve his life?

80 days, weekend getaway without any problems

So this past weekend I left town for the first time since quitting. I went to a beach town (Southern Hemisphere is getting hot!) and got to spend some time by the sea. A bit difficult at first because I hadn't encountered some triggers since quitting... waiting for a long distance bus, getting off the bus after a few hours, relaxing by a fireplace, after swimming in the ocean, the list of my triggers is endless but I really don't feel like a smoker now, the wanting sensation lasts less than a second.

A small victory (which was pointed by my friends, I didn't even notice at first) was that while they were sharing a cig one of them absent mindly put it right in front of my face, as if she was offering me a drag. I wasn't even thinking about taking one, I was just waiting for the friend by my side to grab the cig. That cigarette looked quite awful if you ask me.

So I realized that while sometimes there are triggers that make you think "I could kill for a smoke right now", you don't really want a cigarette. You want the idealized version of it. Like everything in the past, you tend to remember the good times and forget the bad ones. 

I noticed I sometimes want to light up a cig and fantasize about those first few drags, but when presented with a true, half smoked cigarette all I could think was "I hope they get this thing out of my face quickly"

Keep strong everybody! Happy New [smoke free] Year!

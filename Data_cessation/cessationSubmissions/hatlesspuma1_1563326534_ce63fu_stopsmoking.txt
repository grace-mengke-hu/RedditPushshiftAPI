I just vape, never smoked a cig. What can I expect from withdrawals? Quitting weed was hard for me.

I want to quit vaping. I am scared though, as quitting weed gave me the first two panic attacks of my life, which were awful. I cried for the first time in 6 years (Iâ€™m 17 for reference) and I am not sure if I can go through that intense depression again. 

Could I expect panic attacks? Is it a possibility? How long will anxiety or depression last?

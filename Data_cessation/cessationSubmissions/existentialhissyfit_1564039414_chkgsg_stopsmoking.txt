Day 3 without smoking, I have eaten everything in the world

Full blown binge mode since I stopped smoking. I feel like a gd lunatic &amp; can't stop shoveling food in my gob &amp; I'm literally making myself sick. But hey, haven't smoked a cigarette in 3 days. Hoping that the binge subsides the longer I've been away from my smokes. For those who have had this problem, how have you coped without gaining 400 lbs?

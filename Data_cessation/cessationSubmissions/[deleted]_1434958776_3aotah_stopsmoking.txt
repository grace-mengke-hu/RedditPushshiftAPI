30 days! Twinkle twinkle

Star light star bright

30 days I'm clean tonight

I wish I may, I wish I might

Never have another light.

Thanks, /r/stopsmoking - I couldn't have done it without the support of this community. To anyone out there struggling, I can only say this: Nicotine doesn't come close to the buzz you feel when you triumph.

Keep at it, all you superstars.

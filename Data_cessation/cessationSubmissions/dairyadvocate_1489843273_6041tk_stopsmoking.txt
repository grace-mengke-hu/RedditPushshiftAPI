Day 3!!

I smoked for 15yrs, at about 20 a day. 

I read the easy way last week and everything about it clicked. I have a hard time taking advice on just about every aspect of life, but for whatever reason I bought into Carr's message. 

Im going to try and be as humble as possible, cause two weeks ago I would've been stressing and anxious about the first 3 hours never mind three days. I'm at 70 hrs cold turkey, and it has been a breeze. I have had a bit of a headache, and tossing and turning at night and only a handful of controllable cravings. 

If there is anyone who is thinking about quitting, I suggest you read that book. It won't blow your mind or anything. It just addresses your fears of quitting, using truth and common sense vs how you perceive them as a smoker. 

I've enjoyed reading everyone's posts on this sub as well. There are a lot of encouraging stories!!! Good luck to everyone who is thinking about quitting.

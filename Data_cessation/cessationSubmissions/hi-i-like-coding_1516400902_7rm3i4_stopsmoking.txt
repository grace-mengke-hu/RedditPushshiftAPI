IRC channel for /r/stopsmoking on irc.snoonet.org

Over on [snoonet](https://snoonet.org/whysnoonet) I noticed there's a channel for /r/stopsmoking, I went to check it out, and it was empty, but registered, so me and another guy have been hanging out there.

I don't see any links to the channel in the sub, so I figured I'd post about it, in case people would like to chat on IRC about quitting.

If you're new to IRC, snoonet has [a guide](https://snoonet.org/help) on how to get started.

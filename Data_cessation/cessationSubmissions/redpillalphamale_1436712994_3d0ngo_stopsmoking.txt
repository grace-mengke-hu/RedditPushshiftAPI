Friend kept offering me cigarettes when drinking

So I was out drinking with some friends and one guy I used to smoke with kept offering me cigarettes. He said cmon man just have only one, he would take it out from the pack and show it to me saying how good it is etc . Of course I didn't smoke. Also I don't have anything against from doing it. I know all to well what it feels like to remain trapped in a sinking ship while everyone else is jumping out.

Is this normal?

My lungs feel a bit irritated. Nothing really bad. It has been 12 days since I last smoked. It feels like I just inhaled, a little tickle throughout my lungs. Also today I was somewhat grumpy, but that may have been the weather (it was very hot here today). Can it be that there still is nicotine in my lungs that's being cleaned up / released?

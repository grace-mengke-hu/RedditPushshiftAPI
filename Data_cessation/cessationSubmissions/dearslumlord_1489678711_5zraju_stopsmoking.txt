I've found that coffee kills my urges

..And I love it. I like to get a stirrer and "sip" the coffee, inhale, then exhale to mimic the same feeling of smoking. I've found that it really helps. I don't know if anyone else has tried this, but I recommend it. 

Stay strong people! It can only get better from here on out!

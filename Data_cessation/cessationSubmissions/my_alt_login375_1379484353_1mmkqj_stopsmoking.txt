The woman I love has smoked over 25,000 cigarettes since she started. She wants to quit. How can I help?

She's been a smoker for over 5 years and has tried to quit several times in the past but it hasn't stuck.

Over the summer we would go for runs but she wasn't able to go very fast and got out of breath after about 5 minutes and had to walk. She also smoked before and after the workouts. She has asked for my help and I've been encouraging her to make healthy decisions. She has been looking into Blu e-cigarettes to help with the nicotine withdrawal issues.

I'm coming to you for advice on how I can help her and I'll certainly pass along any any advice or encouragement you have to offer.

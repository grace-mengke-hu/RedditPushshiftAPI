I relapsed yesterday

so yesterday I went to ACL in Austin, and I was going to the show by myself. I was sitting, waiting for fun. to start, and the girls next to me were smoking camel number 9s. now, these are the cigarettes I started smoking, and no one ever seems to know what they are. so I asked for one. I haven't smoked a single cigarette in almost 10 months, but I did yesterday. and I regretted it almost instantly. but I'm kind of glad I did. because even though I told myself I wanted it, I didn't really. cigarettes aren't the same. they smell bad, they taste bad, and they're bad for you. 

so even though I fucked up a little bit, it's not a total loss. just a little hiccup. 

the best part? I have literally ABSOLUTELY no desire to start smoking again. I'm better than the one fuck up I've had in close to a year.

Total chaos, didn't smoke.

On day 11, found out my grandmother and my cousin died on Wednesday. 
Two separate events and situations. Grieving, yes. But didn't smoke. Everything feels kind of surreal. I'm not saying this to fish for "sorry for your loss" comments. Just saying that even though everything is chaotic at the moment, I don't feel the need to turn to nicotine. 
My grandmother chained smoked for sixty years, how she made it that long I have no idea. She was nearly 80, and I may not ever know if it was a brain aneurysm or heart failure or what, because my family wants to get her buried as soon as possible (Saturday). It was so sudden. I would sit on the front porch with her the last few months and smoke with her when I picked up cigs again. But I am greatful she went peacefully and quickly, it could have ended much worse. I'm glad I don't have cigarettes in my life anymore. She was the only one in my family left who smoked, I feel like a chapter in my life has completely closed. I don't want the quality of life that she had, with a tackle box full of pills. 

My parents leave for Mexico this weekend on vacation and my dad's words "death comes in threes" are kind of haunting me. I always worry when they leave but that made me pretty paranoid (I'll get over it).

Speaking of tackle boxes though, I started playing FishingPlanet on PS4, and it's a really great game to pass the time. I used to game a lot but not much anymore, but this game really holds my attention. 

Just feeling really good about the quit even through all the sadness, feeling solid. Thanks Reddit. Probably wouldn't have come this far without this community.

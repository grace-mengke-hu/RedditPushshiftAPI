How to deal with a partner who still smokes?

Hi everyone!

So it's been six days. I can honestly say that this is so much easier than I ever thought it would be. It's really down to all you folks here, reading about your victories, your struggles and your thoughts has given me the perspective I needed to quit. I honestly don't even want to smoke any more.

I just have one problem now; my live-in partner still smokes. He tries not to smoke at home (well, outside our apartment, we never smoked inside anyway) but he's caved once or twice. My problem is that it's really hard to see him smoking and to smell the stench of it on his breath when I kiss him. It's like as soon as you quit, you internalise all the terrible things you know about smoking. As a smoker, I used to ignore them but now I can't stop thinking about lung cancer and heart disease. I don't want this man to die young because he thinks he can't give up cigarettes.

I really want to suggest that he quit but he keeps saying how he's worried that he'll never want to quit as much as I did, that he won't do as well as me, that he's not sure he even wants to quit yet anyway. I think my talk about how easy I found it worried him rather than motivated him.

I really don't want to nag him because at the end of the day, it's his decision. But I also don't want him to become complacent about smoking because he thinks he can't quit.

What should I do? Should I just shut up and let him get on with it?!

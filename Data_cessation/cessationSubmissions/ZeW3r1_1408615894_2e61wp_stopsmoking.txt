Well then, four weeks!

So....i did it now. 4 full weeks. I am happy. Really happy. At the start of this week, i heard that i will be serving in my countrys defence forces in a year, so i'm starting a training program and going to get in a better shape. I'm a little confused, that i haven't really had any major cravings anymore and i love the fact that everytime someone smokes near me, i hate the smell. Not to say that i ever loved it hah, but now it's just disgusting and it just keeps me further away from cigs and i'm so greatful that i've achieved this point in my progress of quitting. Thank you all for your great support, it's been REALLY big help! Keep going everyone!

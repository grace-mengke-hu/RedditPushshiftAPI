My friend wants to stop smoking for a Girl, but only for her. He says he doesn't care about his own body.

I want him to succeed in stopping to smoke. He says he doesn't care about his own body (it's not my business at all what he does with it) but I need some tips on how to support him and what to text back when he texts me saying " I NEED TO SMOKE! ".

When to focus on weight loss

So before I quit smoking.. I began working out. I lost 10 pounds last year. I haven’t had a cigarette in 27 days now.. but I can’t seem to stop eating everything in sight! I haven’t gained any weight because I still go to the gym 5x a week. But I’ve plateaued at 145lbs (5’2 F) and have a vacation coming up in may and want to lose 20 more pounds. Everyone keeps telling me to focus on one thing at a time.. but when is it a good time to start dieting again after quitting nicotine? Thanks in advance!

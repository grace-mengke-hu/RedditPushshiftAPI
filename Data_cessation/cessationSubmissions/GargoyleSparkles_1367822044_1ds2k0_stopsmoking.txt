64 days in...

The good: I hate the smell of cigarettes. I've had cravings, sure. However, I am able to ignore them because I don't feel like getting ass-mouth and regret. I am rather confident that I will never smoke a cigarette again. 

The bad: I have Major Depressive Disorder and Panic Disorder, so the nonsmoking has been hell on my mood. I've had to have my medications adjusted several times, and have missed way too much work due to panic attacks that were never an issue before. I've been doing a lot of questioning about where I'm going to live when my lease is up in 2 months; whether I can stay at my current job (high-stress customer service) and how I'm going to be successful with selling my house this summer. Hence, being awake at 2:30am on a Sunday night. 

At least all of this isn't enough to make me pick up another cig, I suppose...

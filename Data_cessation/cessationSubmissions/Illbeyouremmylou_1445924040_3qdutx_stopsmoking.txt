Wellbutrin/zyban

Hey! My first time posting, I've been lurking for a while and have decided to give it a go.
I started taking Wellbutrin 7 days ago.. As far as smoking cessation, I'm completely amazed. I'm usually a pack a day smoker, yesterday I smoked 2 cigarettes without even trying to cut back. I actually made myself smoke those because I'm scared to withdrawal too harshly! 
Sounds lovely right? Here's the down side:
1. Extreme anxiety, probably the worst I've ever experienced. I almost feel what id imagine it's like to be manic.
2. Can't sleep (it's 2AM)

Last night, I was talking about quitting and the side effects of these pills.. I said I was going to stop taking them tomorrow. He said he thinks I should continue trying to quit. I was telling him how hard it is and I actually started crying.. As if I was losing someone close to me or something. It made me realize how dependant I am on this crap!
So I guess I'll keep going with the Wellbutrin, have any of you had success with it? Do these side effects ease off?

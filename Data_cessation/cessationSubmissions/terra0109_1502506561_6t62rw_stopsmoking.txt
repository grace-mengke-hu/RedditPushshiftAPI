Last cigarette

Hey everyone, I just wanted to mark the day of my last cigarette, Aug 11, 2017. I started smoking regularly at 17 and I'm now 24. I had no control over it until earlier this year when I cut down to about 1-5 cigarettes a day. I think that my body isn't going to have much of a problem functioning without nicotine since I haven't been smoking very much but I'm no expert so I'll have to wait and see. 

I'm just expecting that it's going to feel weird, but I started doing yoga about a week ago and I'm really committed to it so I think that should help with the quitting process.

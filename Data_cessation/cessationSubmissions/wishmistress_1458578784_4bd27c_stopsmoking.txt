5 months. Thinking about starting again

I don't have the craving anymore. I quit only because I wanted my boyfriend to quit. He had health issues. But I never had any problems with smoking. My boyfriend still has craving from time to time.

When I see others smoke, I get the urge to start smoking again. Maybe because it's something to do when I have to wait, or I'm just bored.

I smoked once during these 5 months and I liked it. The only reason I didn't start again was my boyfriend.

I didn't like smelling like cigarettes before and it made my mouth dry. Maybe I've just forgotten how it felt. I do remember now that I used to cough after running.

I know I shouldn't start again, but I still want it when I see others.

I need your help. Any help to make me not want to start smoking. I've come such a long way and it seems like I'm always going to want a cigarette.
Also, will my boyfriend's craving ever stop? He had smoked for 13 years

Wellbutrin/Patch advice!

After quitting cold turkey and having quit for 6 months and starting again I decided to see a doctor. He gave me Wellbutrin and told me to use it with the patch for 8 days. If anyone used this method is it effective or would just taking the Wellbutrin work on its own? I want to stay quit this time and I'll do whatever it takes. I just want to be done with these stupid cigarettes. 


Edit: screw it, I'm doing it cold turkey again. It's 12:23am on the second day of CT and while it's a minor irritation to myself and family I'm just fucking ready to kick this disgusting habit. I don't need patches or medicine, I want to prove to myself I can do it without.

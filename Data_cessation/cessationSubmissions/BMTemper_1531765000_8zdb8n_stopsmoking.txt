Trying to quit when I don't want to.

I'm having a dilemma as I don't want to quit, but I'm trying to.

I recently did the math and I don't spend nearly as much as I thought I was, it'd be no more than 3k; pack a week, and gave myself some leniency (1.5 packs/wk). So that didn't help giving me more reason to.

So then I tried to convince myself to quit for the health benefits, but I always get back to the fact that I don't want to quit, which might be because I can't instantly tell how much better my body is for not smoking? I don't know.

 I enjoy the habit itself. 


**TL;DR:** I want to quit(?), but I don't want to quit, especially after realising I'm not spending as much money as I thought. Thought I'd ask some other people who are aware of the good shit that comes with quitting.

Two weeks smoke free in first ever attempt.

I ve smoked a pack of 20 for 21 years from the time I was 19. I had thought of quitting a few years back but didn't get the need to quit as I was stupid enough to think that smoke helps on a daily basis.

I quit cold turkey two weeks back and it was extremely hard. I set a rule not to smoke ever again no matter what. I intend to stick to this rule for ever. I've heard people relapsing after years of quitting which is kind of disheartening even though I know everyone tried as hard as I am right now.

I've recorded voice memos that I playback to myself to remind me how good it's going to get if I pass this craving now. I do this for every craving I get and now these are quite low intensity which I can tame easily. So overall, I've had a pleasant experience so far. My breathing problems have disappeared, I don't get tired anymore, I crave more for sweets which is bad but I'm trying to bring it to normal too.

Stay put. Make it a rule. Don't try this again no matter what , and you won't. So far so good and gonna try my best to live by this rule forever.

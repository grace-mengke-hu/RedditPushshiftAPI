Look at my badge! I've earned my first star! :D

Thank you so much, /r/stopsmoking! I wouldn't have accomplished this without the help of this subreddit. Thank you so much, guys! :) This means a lot to me, really. 

31 days ago, if someone had told me that I would be a nonsmoker for 1 month by the end of June, I wouldn't have believed it. I'm not sure HOW I've managed to do it, but somehow I have! :D I'm so happy, and so proud of myself! 

Only a few weeks ago, I was one of those people who would say "Yeah, I know I should stop smoking, but I actually really like it! I don't want to give up smoking because I enjoy it!". Also, I was quite sure that I would never be able to quit. Deep inside I knew that I wasn't able to controll my behaviour.  

It's so weird to hear people say those words now, knowing that this mindset has nothing to do with free will. I didn't realize how strong my addiction to nicotine was until I decided to quit. Those first few cigarette-free days were crazy!

Little by little I'm getting used to a cigarette-free life. Being a nonsmoker feels more and more natural every day, and although I have daily cravings, it's getting easier to forget cigarettes.   

I have to admit that I still somehow miss to light one up.. not the cigarette itself maybe, but those moments. You know what I mean, like after a stressful day, or after you achieved something. Those moments when you sit down and light one up to relax, or to reward yourself.. The weird thing here: Thinking back, I was never able to completely enjoy those moments BECAUSE of the cigarettes. It was all about lighting up and smoking a cigarette. Whatever I was proud of was only secondary. Now I can sit back, relax, beat the cravings and enjoy those moments completely. Without distraction.  

I really liked the smiley-badge I had in my first smoke-free week. I guess I have to work towards my star-smiley-badge now! :D

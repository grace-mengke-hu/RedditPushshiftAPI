Just smoked last cigarette

My most successful quit was at the beginning of last july when I bought an e-cigarette. It lasted for three weeks but I was having issues with the e-cigarette and went back. This time I'd like to use the e-cigarette for a week or so, only until I feel the addiction has lifted. Last year, after about a week I felt like I no longer even needed the e-cigarette but continued to use it anyway. I'd like to have one around just in case. 

Last year I was also drinking occasionally and smoking weed regularly, this year I'm not so I think it'll make it easier. I'd always crave nicotine while drinking or after smoking some weed, so I won't have those cravings along with my regular ones. Coincidentally, I'm also starting a new job tomorrow but I don't think it'll be very stressful and there aren't many hours, so I doubt It'll give me issues.

I've put my ashtray and lighter away, here goes.

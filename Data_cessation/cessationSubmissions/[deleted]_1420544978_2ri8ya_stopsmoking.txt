I want to quit smoking but I have an anxiety disorder.

I started smoking exactly 4 years ago. I was 18 and I am now 22.
I've had a general anxiety disorder since I can remember. I had OCD between 15-17. 
A year ago I developed a panic disorder. The panic attacks are gone finally, it's been over 2 months!, but I still have a feeling of unease everyday. 
I don't take pills. I've tried taking anti depressants but I don't like the side effects and I want to deal with my issues on my own. I do take Xanax but it's been 2 months since I've taken them.

I'm really turned off by smoking. It's gross and I don't want to smell like smoke anymore. 
My teeth aren't as white as they used to be and I get the yellow finger once in a while.

I'm under a lot of money stress (I was fired 3 days ago and am behind on bills.) And smoking only adds to it. It's expensive at almost $9 a pack. 

I don't know how I can do this. With all the stress lately and the anxiety I have in general.

I need some advice! I'm sick of the nasty habit. It's really lost it's appeal to me.

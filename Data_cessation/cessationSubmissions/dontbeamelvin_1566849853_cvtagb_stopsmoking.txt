Quit vaping

Hi all,

I quit vaping on August 13th. This isn't the first time I have quit but I am determined to make it my last. 

So far I have been dealing with brain fog, fatigue, terrible dreams, and even painful muscle spasms. 

This is not fun but I'm almost at 2 weeks. I hope I turn a corner soon..

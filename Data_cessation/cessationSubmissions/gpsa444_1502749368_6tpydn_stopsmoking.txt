Since I've become a nonsmoker

In case anyone else has had this experience, I wanted to share what I've been dealing with. One of the things I recognized within the first week of not smoking was how much it was a form of self-medication for my anxiety. I've been in therapy for my anxiety and depression for the last two and a half years... But not smoking the cigs sent me into some of the worst anxiety I had experienced in recent memory. 

As a result of becoming a nonsmoker, I realized that I was not really dealing with my problems. I realized that my therapy was only somewhat effective. I realized that facing the music would necessitate, for me, more than "just" quitting smoking. Since I've quit, I've made the decision to start real medication, and to find a new therapist. 

If anyone else out there struggles with anxiety or depression, and you are trying to quit... Know that you may find out that you need some extra help from medical professionals, and don't be afraid or ashamed to ask for it.

So far, my biggest lesson in all of this has been that I am the only one in control of my actions and my decisions. Not taking the actions needed to help me is making a decision to not help me.

my girlfriend laughed at me. [5 months]

We parked outside a store, she ran in while I sat in the car. Someone was smoking near our open windows. She commented that it smelled like cigarettes and I told her jokingly "sorry, I smoked a cigarette in here" and she laughed. The thought of me smoking a cigarette is so ridiculous at this point as to be laughable! Made me feel really good.

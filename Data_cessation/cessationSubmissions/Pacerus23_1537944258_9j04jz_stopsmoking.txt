5th quite attempt in 3 years. No cravings but I always seem to fall back into smoking help.

Like most smokers, I have come to hate the fact that I am a smoker. This is my second attempt to quite this year. Did not smoke for the month of March, relapsed in April.

&amp;#x200B;

Been smoking for 13 years, 20 sticks a day. 

&amp;#x200B;

Every quite attempt over the last few years has gone the same way.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't get very strong cravings, I keep my emotions in check; don't show my irritation or anything like that.

&amp;#x200B;

I just seem to lose focus after a couple of days and bum a cigarette from someone after a couple of weeks, with no real reason to smoke.

&amp;#x200B;

And before I know it I am back at a pack a day, hating it all the way.

&amp;#x200B;

It would be helpful if anyone can share their own experience, if if you have similar experiences and found a way around this cycle, I would really appreciate your advice. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks

Day 4. Having a small crisis regarding that after work cigarettes.

So it's day four and after circling three different gas station parking lots I ended up giving in. I need something to replace that end of the work day cigarette. This is reallly the hardest one to give up. Anyone have anything? Any idea for something I could do to replace that decompression smoke? I know this isn't a failure. Just a speed bump. Thanks.

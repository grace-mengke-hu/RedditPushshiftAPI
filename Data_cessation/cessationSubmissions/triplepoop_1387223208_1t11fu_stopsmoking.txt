48 hours...wow

For me this is the first time ever going without a cigarette in...a decade. Boy, does it feel overwhelming.

For those who are on the line and struggling to quit, I want to share with you what I've experienced within the past 48-hours:


*  AIRRRRR. My breathes are deeper, crisper, and it's wildly amazing.


*  SLEEP. After overcoming the night time cravings, I fall asleep like a baby and wake up like a champ.


*  TASTE. Technicolor vs. black-and-white. Amazing.


*  SMELL. I don't reek anymore yay! When I put on my jackets and smell the smoke lingering from 2-days ago I'm so shocked at how bad we smokers smelled!

These 2 days have been eye-opening and what smokers have been blinded to is a crime. I'm inviting the lurkers on this subreddit to try it even for a few days to come back and realize what we used to have.

Visiting this subreddit has helped tremendously when I'm feeling down. Thank you guys for the help.

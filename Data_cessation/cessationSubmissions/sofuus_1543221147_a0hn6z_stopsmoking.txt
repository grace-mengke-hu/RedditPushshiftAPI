failed and will start again today

heyo, last week i failed and bought a pack after day 2... ended up buying 2 packs total. im now on my last 3 cigs and i cant afford a new, so i will stop. im also going to stop with my mum tomorrow, we will do it together so maybe it will be easier. 

wish me luck! i know i can do this. its hard but i will remind myself of all the shit that comes with smoking. not worth going outside every hour in -10c .

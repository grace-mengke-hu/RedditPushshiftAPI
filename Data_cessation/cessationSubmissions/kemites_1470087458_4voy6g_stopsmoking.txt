Quitting smoking unexpected victory!!

So my job allows us a paid break in the morning, but every afternoon I would take two smoke breaks I had to clock out for. Ever since I quit 10 days ago, I haven't been taking an afternoon break at all and I just got paid this week, my check is $25 more than usual!! So on top of the money I'm saving by not buying cigs, I'm making an extra $100 a month! So glad I finally did this.

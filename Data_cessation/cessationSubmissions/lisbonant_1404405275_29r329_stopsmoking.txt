Over a year!

Hey!  Just noticed my badge flipped over.  I missed it by five whole days.  Which means it FINALLY has stopped consuming my every thought process, lurking in the background of my subconscious, fighting to win me over again.  Fuck you, cigarettes.  I'm better than that.

Keep fighting the good fight, people.  Y'all rock my socks off.  Thanks /r/stopsmoking

3 months today and it feels great

I smoked for 7 years. Started at 17 and I did love it but it was just not worth feeling like shit all the time. I quit the day after I drank a lot and woke to a massive hangover. Have not looked back which I thought was bizarre because this was my first attempt at quitting!

I thought I had it under control

Well, after a year of being smoke free, I decided to throw it all out of the window this past weekend. Well, two weekends ago. A friend was in town so we drank and caught up and he offered a cigarette. I broke down (I really didn't even think about it) and I accepted it. That lead to buying a pack and I smoked that pack throughout the week, reassuring myself that that would be the last pack. Of course once the pack ran out, my weak-willed self went to buy another this weekend.  Again, I'm telling myself that this is the last one. I hope it is. 

The whole time I've been smoking, I've been asking myself "what's wrong with you? You're throwing it all away." And another part of me really thinks that I have it under control since I already quit for a year and can do it again. It's a self-sabotaging thought process. Do you guys think the same way? Or relapsed after so long?

Good luck to all of you.

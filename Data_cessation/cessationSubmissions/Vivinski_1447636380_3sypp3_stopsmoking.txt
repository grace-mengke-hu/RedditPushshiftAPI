Yes! 1 year tobacco free!

First of all. I do smoke hash, but pure without tobacco so no nicotine but still not very good.

But.... I kicked that one dumb habbit. 
Ahh I remember the first weeks were hell, constantly eating lollypops and junkfood when I had cravings. Then after a few months it was like parting ways with a dear friend, thinking I was forgetting something when leaving the house. Still the occasional craving but it gradually got better. After about six months I really started believing I could do it because I felt I had beaten all the pitfalls. The cravings got less intense and more time passed between them.

Now after a year I feel I can genuinely say I've quit. 

Good luck on your way people!

18M I look like I am 26-30 years old already. I am stopping this today.

Hey,

I started smoking when I was 15 years old. I smoked constantly for 2 years then went to vaping for about a year. Well I recently picked up smoking again in the past 3 months. A couple of days ago I looked in the mirror and just looked in terror. I have wrinkles forming next to the ends of my lips; it constantly looks like I am frowning. I am getting wrinkles around my mouth and when I smile you can see them. I have 2 wrinkles running horizontal on my forehead and they look horrible. My skin is aging. I recently was at the doctors office and my blood pressure was 121/70. The top number is already in the pre-high category even though I run, lift weights, and try to eat decently. Finally my teeth are fucking YELLOW. It is absolutely disgusting how I am aging so fast and how I am starting to look. 

Today is the day I say NO to aging and I kick this habit once & for all.

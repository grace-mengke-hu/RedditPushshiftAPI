Other quitting resources

I've noticed that Allen Carr gets a lot of exposure here at this sub. I agree that his method seems to be of great value and has a great success rate but I thought it might help newcomers if there was a variety of resources from which they could glean.

What are some other resources new ( and old ) quitters could check out?

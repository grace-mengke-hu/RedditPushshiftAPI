Day 7: The sleeping problem

Hi R/stopsmoking, so glad I found you guys... Anyways...

Have quit for a week now, technically it's been three weeks but I caved last week. It was weird. I was out in a setting where I would always smoke, in a spa with friends, and without thinking I grabbed the deck. It was by the end I realised how sick I felt and stopped. But that was an environmental thing so a minor setback.

Back to the real point. I've been smoking since I was 14, sad I know, I'm 19 now so it's been 5 years. Not as long as many, but more than enough to develop the addiction. I went through 3 years of at least a pack a day, sometimes 2 when I finished school. It was when my mum found out, heartbroken that I decided to quit. It was a heart wrenching feeling, I've hurt her before, as any terrible teenage son has, but this somehow was worse. In her shoes I was putting myself in the path many of her brothers had, smoking myself closer to potential death (sorry to make anyone feel shit for saying that :( )

I decided I quit. It's been going great, withdrawal symptoms are slowly going away, I'm on the gum, chewing, parking, rinse and repeat. Serve icy fresh. I've cut down on the gum too. 

The only problem I'm having where I am craving hard is late at night 8 can't sleep. I am short of breath and it feels suffocating. Only when I'm in bed. I sit up, take deep breaths, but nothing really works well. I end up falling asleep at 3 am on average, having to wake up at 7. I fully expect this to pass, but secretly hoping it doesn't take months. But I don't know.

Anyways, I feel healthier and happier with my progress so far, so no signs of stopping the process now.

Keep up the good work guys! :)

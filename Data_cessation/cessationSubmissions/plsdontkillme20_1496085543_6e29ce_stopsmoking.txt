19 and coughing up black phlegm for months

Hey, so I've been a pretty hardcore pot smoker for two years now(at least 4js, 10-12 bong hits everyday etc) and I always smoked with tobacco.

from the past year I've picked up smoking cigarettes too at uni and I've been smoking at least a half a pack a day.
I've noticed that from that past year I've been coughing a lot more brownish yellowish phlegm and in the mornings its almost always black. I've also lost a lot of weight, but I think that's because of the pot and starving myself, but this phlegm is really scaring me.

I don't really have any chest pain or discomfort, and I work out everyday, but I do not have any stamina anymore.

I've noticed that my spliffs have become harsher(?) for some reason over time, is that possible because of my lungs? I've currently stopped smoking pot (4 days yay) but the cigs aren't happening.
I haven't smoked a cigarette today but that's probably because I acquired dokha. Is dokha worse on my lungs than the cigs? I'd like to try using it to quit cigs but idk if the smoke makes any difference.
any advice would be amazing, thanks.

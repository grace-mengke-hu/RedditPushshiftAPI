Slight chest pain on the second day

Hi all, I have a slight pain in my chest (especially back of my lungs) on my second smoke-free day. Everything else seems to be pretty good and my heart beats & breathing is so much better already. But this pain worries me a bit. It's not even a pain, I just feel like someone's touching my lungs with a needle. Is this normal when quitting?

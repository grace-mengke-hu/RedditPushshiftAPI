How to quit my morning smoke?

Hey guys. I've been cutting down on smokes for the last month or so, used to be 20 a day now about 7. I'm pretty good at controlling it but can't get over smoking first thing when I wake up. Do you have any tips for what I could replace it with? I don't drink caffeine so that's out. Thanks!

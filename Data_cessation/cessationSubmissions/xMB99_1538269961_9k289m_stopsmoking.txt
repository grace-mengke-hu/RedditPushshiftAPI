Need help quitting smoking.

I hadn't smoked a cigarette for 4 days and something really stressed me out today so I bought a pack of smokes and chain smoked them until I felt better. I'm not stressed out anymore so I'm thinking about crushing the rest of the pack up but that would mean I just wasted most of my money. This always happens when I try to quit smoking. The first couple of days when I quit I always have the urge to fight other people but that passes. I can easily go about a week without smoking but than something down the line will always end up stressing me out and then all I can think about is smoking to calm myself down. I have the quit smoking app on my computer and seeing my progress gives me motivation but I always relapse and than I feel ashamed after it.

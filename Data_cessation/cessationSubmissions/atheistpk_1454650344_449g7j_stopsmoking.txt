Best thing I ever did

July 19th, 2008. That was when I had my last cigarette. It was the third time I quit smoking during a 10 year, pack-a-day habit. The first time was 4 months, the second time, 2 months. This time, it's permanent.

For all you fighters on your first 72 hours, or your first week, or your first month, keep the $%^& at it, because the end is more than worth the effort. I can run now until my legs give out, and I'm still not out of breath. I haven't had bronchitis in 8 years, and it was an almost annual thing for me. I never wake up with a painful throat and I don't smell like an ashtray.

Stay strong and stay away from this horrific thing.

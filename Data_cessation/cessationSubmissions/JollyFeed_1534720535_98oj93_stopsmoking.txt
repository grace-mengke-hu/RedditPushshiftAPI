Dear Annoying People, It's Your fault I Smoked.

The title is a bit tongue and cheek. I've spent the entire day grouchy and irritable for no real reason. One of my biggest smoking triggers was dealing with annoying people while at work. Or annoying family members and friends. I'm hoping the "annoyed at all people who breath near me" phase is over soon. How did others cope with it?

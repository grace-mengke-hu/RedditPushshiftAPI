Smoker for 9 years, doctor told me to quit for surgery recovery.

Hey Reddit!
I've been a smoker for 9 years.  During that time I've taken extended breaks (3-6 months), but always go back to smoking because I like it.  Things seem more real when I've got a smoke in my hand, I don't know how to better explain it.  I don't feel like I've ever experienced any of the withdrawal symptoms that people go through when going without.
But next Wednesday, I have surgery on my left shoulder and the surgeon told me that the recovery would go quicker and with a better chance of success if I quit smoking indefinitely (anyone experienced this?).  The part I'll miss most is having a solid 5 minutes to myself several times a day.  So, I'll probably be lurking this sub from time to time during the next couple of months wanted to say "hey".

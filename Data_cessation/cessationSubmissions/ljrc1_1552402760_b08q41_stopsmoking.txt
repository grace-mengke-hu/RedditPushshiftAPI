Observation -stimulant

Unlike some I see on here I’m having poor workouts and less energy in general.
I sleep poorly and expected that to change but so far, at 10 days, that hasn’t changed much. 
Apparently I’ve been using the cigarettes as a stimulant too and never really thought of that. Hoping it all evens out soon. Any advice would be appreciated!

A rant, I don't really expect replies but knowing someone reads is easier.

Smoking is really ruining me, and I've been only smoking for three years.

The biggest problem is that I stopped cared about myself since I started smoking. Before that I loved myself in a healthy way, ate healthy, worked out and just tried to improve myself in various ways.

This al ended when I started smoking, it took all the selfrespect away. I started eating junkfood really a lot. Why does it matter, I'm already ruining my health.

In the last year I've tried quitting for like 10 times, breaking cigarettes and crushing packs only to result in buying new ones a few days later. This badge I have right now is from one of these failed attempts. 

I'm constantly in fear of getting cancer or something likewise but it seems like it doesn't matter at all. I started reading the Alan Carr book today and after being 1/4th through the first thing I did is light up. 

I feel like stopping smoking would be an overall cataclyst to improve my life, if only I managed to do it. Thanks for reading.

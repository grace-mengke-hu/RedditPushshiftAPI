One week in and struggling.

I had no idea how big a role smoking played in my life. 

I usually hang around with some of my co workers after work. We would just mess around and talk shit about our bosses or customers or whatever, but last night I had to leave early, because I just knew that if one of them offered me a cigarette, I wouldn't turn them down.

I'm proud of myself for making it this far, but it sucks because part of me still misses it.

Is that normal, or am I not trying hard enough?

I picked a date!

Do I have to be quit to post here?  If so I'll take it down.  Just wanted to put it out there to someone!  I have tried to quit and actually quit so many times before and failed that I don't really have anyone left to be excited for me...they've all heard it many times before.  The longest I stayed quit was 6 months, that was about 5 years ago.  I haven't been able to quit with that kind of success again though.  I picked a date, it's my 35th birthday.  It's about a month from now...I also ordered Allen Carr's Easyway to Stop Smoking for some prep.  Trying to mentally prepare myself now...need all the positive vibes I can get.  I don't think I will even tell anyone around me until I have at least a month under my belt.  I need to quit and stay quit.  Watching my step-dad in hospice right now with COPD....still takes that hose off his face to light up.  My dad also has copd, he's quit now about 10 months...but damage already done.  I want to make it to gradparenthood healthy and play with my grandbabies...my oldest is only 10 so I have a ways to go to get and stay healthy.  I want to keep up with my 4 boys...I don't want my kids to smoke.  And so many more reasons....but this is already too long and I'm sure everyone has heard it all.  I've been lurking here a bit and you all seem so supportive and positive...maybe just the support system I need to make a better choice...ummm...every 20 minutes for the rest of my life!

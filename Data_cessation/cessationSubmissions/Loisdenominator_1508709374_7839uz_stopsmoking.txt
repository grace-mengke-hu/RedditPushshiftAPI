Dear lurker

Not so long ago, I was a lurker myself. I kept reading and marvelling at all these people that were going through the same struggle. A few stuck with me...they struck a chord. I wasn't alone after all. I really put everything on my side...I read Allen Carr, I read all the posts, I educated myself on my (finally admitted to) addiction.


I suppose the main message I want to put forth is...it may seem undoable right now, but the fact that you're here means that you are ready, or almost ready. Keep reading and keep educating yourself.

If you're already on your way, keep coming back here and sharing and reading. You'll draw strength you never knew you had from these amazing people.

If you would've asked me just a few years ago...I would've told you I would be a lifelong smoker. Even a month into my quit, I would've told you I would eventually smoke if I was diagnosed with a terminal disease or if I was really old...but now, I would not inflict that horror upon myself. I appreciate myself more than that.

Stay strong my friends!

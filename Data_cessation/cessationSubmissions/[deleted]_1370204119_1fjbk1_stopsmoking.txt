I am sick of wanting to smoke.

After food, at work, while drinking with friends, etc etc. I want to quit because I'm sick of always waiting for that moment that I want one and then smoke one. I realize that smoking does nothing but bad stuff for me, but every time I've had a craving, it's almost like an instinct that I just go out and buy some. 

I want to stop. I just had my last cigarette an hour ago and already I want one. I want that feeling to be gone forever. What were your ways of overcoming the last cigarette? Please don't tell me to read Allen Carr because to be honest I despise reading books.

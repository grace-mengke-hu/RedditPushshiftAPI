Starting my journey.

I just wanted to introduce myself. I'm 32 and have been smoking for over 15 years. I decided to take the plunge and quit a few days after my 32nd birthday. The reasons for quitting are vast. It cost too much, the obvious health concerns, it gives my gf a headache and she hates it . And most importantly I want to prove to myself that I'm in control of my life and that smoking doesn't control me. 

I've been in a funk lately, unmotivated, tired all the time, anxious and a little blue. I'm hoping this battle will help me overcome those problems too. I've also decided why not double down and stop drinking alcohol, caffeine and other smoking pot for a while too. I want to overcome these things and become a better me.

It's been just over 36 hours since I smoked my last cigarette and I felt pretty good making it through the first 24. One day at a time I keep telling myself. I know if I can make it one day without smoking I can make it the next day without smoking. 

I'm at a loss most the day. I enjoyed smoking when taking the dog out, driving in my car, taking a break at work and most importantly after eating... But I'm better than this addiction and I hope to prove to myself that I can do it. 

Thanks for listening. I'm happy this sub is here for the support and I look forward to continuing on this journey with all of you.

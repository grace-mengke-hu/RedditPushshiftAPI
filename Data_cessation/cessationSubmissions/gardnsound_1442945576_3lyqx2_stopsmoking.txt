1 Completely Sober Month

I started this journey a month ago.  I gave up drinking at the start, because although I wasn't smoking during the day - if I went out drinking with friends I always bummed a smoke.  I figured that drinking lowered my resolve, and that I'd stop drinking for a few days until the craving went away.  Once I was sober for a few days (I had been drinking myself drunk, daily)  I discovered that smoking wasn't my only problem.  Quitting both smoking and drinking led me to the realization that I am an alcoholic, and am powerless over the craving that these substances give me.  




In the past 30 + days, I have been recognized at work for higher levels of achievement, I have worked out harder than I used to (down 10 lbs), and made more progress on my home projects than I have in the past 4 months combined.  My wife has noticed the change in my personality, and refers to me as either "new gardnsound" or "old gardnsound"; which makes me cry because it is tough to hear, but it also helps me steel my resolve and strive to be an "even better new gardnsound".




I guess I just wanted to voice this and let you know that if an alcoholic can quit smoking, you can too.  Keep it up!

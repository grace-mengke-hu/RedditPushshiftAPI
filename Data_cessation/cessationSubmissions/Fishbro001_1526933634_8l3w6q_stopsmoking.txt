Started smoking half year ago, quitting now. Intense nausea?

Started smoking half year ago I smoked not more than 1 pack in two-three days. 

Started because I was very bored, I know it's stupid.


I don't feel any cravings but I have an intense nausea. What gives?

Can anybody help me relieve that, I have to keep my head out through a window because I feel so nauseous I need lots of fresh air.

40 days and struggling.

I’m on vacation with my dad this week (starting today) and he’s a heavy, HEAVY, smoker. I was fine this morning, but now I’m sitting here debating with myself if I head across the street and buy a pack and smoke only on vacation. This sucks. I’ve been worried about this moment since I quit and it’s here now.

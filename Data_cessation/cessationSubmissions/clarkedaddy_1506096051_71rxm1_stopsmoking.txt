Always thirsty

So I was actually a smokeless tobacco user but there isn't a large reddit community for that and they're  nearly all the same buttttttt.....

I'm 13 days in to my quit and I'm always thirsty.  I've been drinking tons of water,  more than before,  and I'm still  constantly thirsty.  And not in a oral fixation  substitute kind of desire for water but Legit thirsty.  Is this irrelevant to quitting and coincidentally coinciding at the same time or pretty normal symptom of quitting?  If so,  how long can i expect this to last?  Tired of waking with a dry throat.

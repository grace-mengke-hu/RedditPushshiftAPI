24 hours down

So I've hit 24 hours, longest period I've been without a smoke since 2011. Anyone in Australia will understand: it's no longer financially viable for me to smoke (something like US$18 for a 20 pack now). Doing the patch thing because I work in a call centre, and I need something to take the edge off haha.

What was the biggest thing for you? For me, it's the ritual, the habit, having the post dinner smoke, elevensies, or if I'm a bit bored.  Because I'm on the patches, it's less a full on craving and more needing something to occupy myself with.

Can anyone recommend any classic PS3 games!?

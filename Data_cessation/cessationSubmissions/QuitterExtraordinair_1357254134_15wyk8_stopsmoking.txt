Two weeks.

Today has been the hardest day since I stopped smoking two weeks ago, but it has nothing to do with how long it has been.

It's been a hard day because my work schedual has left me exhausted and before I stopped I would use cigarettes as a crutch to wake me up when I would get this exhausted.

I almost caved in three times today, but there is no need to. I've got this.

Stay strong out there. Thanks for the motivation from others posting their updates. My sense of taste and smell are coming back substantially and my breathing is significantly less labored. Overall, I am more than happy with this time.

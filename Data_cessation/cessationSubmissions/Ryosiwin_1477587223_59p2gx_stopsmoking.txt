I feel like complete shit.

I quit for like 3 or 4 months and was doing great. Then out of the blue I started bumming smokes. I thought "It's not so bad as long as I'm not buying them." Then I just went and bought a pack on impulse. That was 3 packs ago and 2 weeks. I'm on my 4th pack and I hate myself. I keep saying to myself "this is my last pack" and then I buy another. I feel like I need accountability. My SO and I quit at the same time but I have been smoking on and off and I feel guilty about it because I have to lie to her. First time she caught me with cigs she flew off the handle, understandably, and said she just wishes I would tell her. So I told her the next time and she flew off again. So now I'm the sleezy guy going behind his SO's back and smoking. I'm starting to get a smokers cough again and hate it. Idk what to do I feel like they control me and I can't do anything to stop my craving brain.

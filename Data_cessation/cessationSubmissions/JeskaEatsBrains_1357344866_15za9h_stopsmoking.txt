Day 3 coming to a close. Husband's first day beginning.

So, had my last cigarette at 11:50 P.M. on New Years Eve. My husband and I recently moved to Colorado from Nevada a few weeks ago into his mother's house while we got jobs and found a place of our own. One of his mother's requests was for us to quit smoking so we wouldn't smell up her house. We had been cutting back the last two weeks but it took me until then to finally commit to quitting. I've been pretty lucky, I think. My cravings haven't been very bad at all and the last time I had one was just to give myself something to do socially while standing out in the freezing cold. My husband on the other hand is already fighting withdraws since smoking his last one yesterday. In fact, he is currently on his way to pick up another pack to "quit gradually." We have nicotine gum but it tastes like wax and makes him feel sick. What is your best curb your craving trick for right there in the moment?

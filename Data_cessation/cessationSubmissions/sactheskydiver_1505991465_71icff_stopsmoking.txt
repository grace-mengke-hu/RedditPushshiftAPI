Waking up in a panic

So tonight (morning I guess it's almost 5 am) I started wheezing bad from some nasty stuff in my lungs and decided to quit (tried a handfull of times for 24 hours tops) I've been smoking almost 10 years since around 15 and ever since I was 16 the first thing I do in the morning is wake up and have a cig.

But it's not like I think about it, my wife says I autopilot myself out of bed to the porch, sometimes I even go back to bed. Sometimes I don't even remember doing it and this specific habit has made quitting extra difficult. I have been on day 3 and found myself smoking and realized I was trying to quit and get very frustrated. 

Any tips on getting control of my autopilot would be greatly appreciated, once I'm awake and thinking about it I can do it even if it's hard but when I first wake up I feel like I have no control

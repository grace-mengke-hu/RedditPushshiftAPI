Anxiety after quitting?

So I'm two weeks in. I'm shocked that I'm doing this well- this is my first serious attempt at quitting after about 18 years as a smoker.

I've noticed a huge increase in my anxiety level over the last few days. Did anyone else experience this? In the first few days, I get it but... Two weeks in with a routine down? Nothing else has changed so... I'm thinking its quitting.

I will say (sorry) that although my cravings are fairly easy to deal with- I do truly miss it.... And often feel sad about quitting (pathetic... I know).

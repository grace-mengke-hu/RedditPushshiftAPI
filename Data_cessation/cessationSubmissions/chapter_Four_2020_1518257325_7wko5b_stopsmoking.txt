My sugar consume is way too high.

I quit for like 9 times in the past year, this time I also quit weed so I’m 100% sure i won’t relapse cause I don’t do the action of smoking.  

I want to start new diet, going more the gym and cut off completely sugar.  

How de phuc do I do that??? I also quit watching porn and fapping, quit video games ... my life changed 180•!!! But sugar , the chocolate is there were my friend in time of need. If I quit that too what I will rely on!? My will power??? Guys who quit cigarettes and then sugars, please ADVICE COMRADES!!

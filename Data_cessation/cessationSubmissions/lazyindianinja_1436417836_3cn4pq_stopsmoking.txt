I just stopped smoking after reading Allen Carr's book. I do feel optimistic that I can stay away from the drug this time, but the cravings are pretty bad. What do i do to ignore them or how do I counter them to feel better?

If you could share anything that has helped you in the first 3 days of the withdrawal period, it would be appreciated! 

And if there are any points from the book that I should remember and keep running through my mind to make it a happier process.

P.S: 12 hours cigarette free! Baby Steps! Cmon!!

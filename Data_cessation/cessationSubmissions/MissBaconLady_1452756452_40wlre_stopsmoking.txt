Day 10

. . . and it's worse than day 1! Oh my God you guys I cannot stop eating! Bad stuff, too. I'm a nanny and my little dude is at soccer practice right now. I'm surrounded by nachos, pretzels, popcorn, candy, beer! Are you KIDDING? I went to the crane game and got a crane-full of little candies and caramels. Screw this! Any advice on what appetite suppressants could help?

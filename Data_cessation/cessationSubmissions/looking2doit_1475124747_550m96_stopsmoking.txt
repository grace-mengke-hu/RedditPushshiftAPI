Day 4! Was too nervous to post before this

I haven't ever made it this far before, so I was hesitant to post if I was just going to fail. 

Somehow failure is (seems) worse if others know about it. 

Anyway, I did one hour of hypnotherapy on Saturday and felt Amazing coming out of there. I felt so good and sure of myself. Had some craving related anxiety here and there but in all been doing just fine.

Usual stuff, probably am gaining a little weight, and am waking up weird times of the night, but I have dodged smoking any cigarettes and that's the point!

I have continued to drink my coffee, and that hasn't been a problem. I really really like coffee. 

I quit alchohol some years ago, and that was much MUCH more challenging than this, maybe that's why this is seeming pretty easy.

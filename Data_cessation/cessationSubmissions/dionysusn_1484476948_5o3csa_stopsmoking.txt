Is it harder each time?

I started smoking when i was 15, quit for all of a week when i was 27, then once again last year for about two weeks when I was 29. Now I'm 30 I decided that was it, I'm done. I'm finished. 

Read Allen Carrs book (for the 3rd time) and noticed that it resonates less each time. The first 24 hours were piss easy, no cravings, sense of euphoria, but I felt that little nagging, 'ah fuck it, have a cheeky pack and start again'. So I had a couple of glasses of wine to distract myself. BIG mistake. I normally got by on about 10 a day, but once I started drinking I'd smash a 30gram pack of tobacco a night. I chain smoke like its going out of fashion. Now my emotions are flying around. I'm irritable, I wanna get really drunk, I wanna go running or swimming until I'm exhausted. All cus my brain is running out of nicotine. 

No real questions here, just had to write out whats going on. I live opposite a 24 hour convenience store and my jet lag is keeping me awake all night. Trying to keep myself accountable and not caving and walking the 20 seconds across the road. 

Best of luck to you all!

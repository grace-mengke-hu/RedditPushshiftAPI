Tips for quitting smokeless tobacco?

Hey all,

I know this sub-Reddit is directed towards smokers. I hope I'm not intruding as a smokeless tobacco user. If so, please let me know.

I've been using smokeless tobacco for a decade now... I started with American smokeless like grizzly, Copenhagen, etc. Within a few years my gums were in terrible condition, bleeding, sore, etc. I then switched to Swedish snus and all of my gum problems went away and I kind of stopped thinking about my addiction. 

Snus is relatively affordable, so cost was never really an issue to me. That being said I'm sick and tired of being an addict. I use snus from the time I wake up until I go to sleep. Hell, as disgusting as it is I've actually slept with the stuff in my mouth. Besides wanting to quit for myself, my son recently turned a year old and had pulled an empty can out of the trash... he came up to me with the empty can and made a motion like he was putting it in his mouth. I felt horrible seeing my son mimic my addiction. 

I found the stats on the particular snus that I use (Thunder Frosted Extra Strong); it's 16mg/g and there are 37g of tobacco in each can. I know only a portion of this nicotine is absorbed, but that's still 592mg of nicotine that I'm using daily. I go through at least a can a day, sometimes a bit more. 

I'm wanting to do all of this cold turkey. I'm not trying to insult/belittle anyone who used nicotine replacement therapy; whatever gets you guys to quit is fantastic! Personally I know using any nicotine will get me back on the habit. I also don't know of any nicotine replacement therapy that can provide even a fraction of my current nicotine intake. I'm scared to quit but I'm down to 8 cans, and I'm not going to order more. 

Any tips?

TL:DR

I use a rediculous amount of nicotine and I need to quit. Halp!

Tips for getting drunk for the first time since quitting.

My friend's birthday is coming up, and we usually celebrate it by partying, and I've been cigarette-free for almost 4 months. During that 4 months I haven't been to any parties, so avoiding 'social pressures' of smoking has been easy. My friends are all social smokers so they will definitely be smoking on the night. Although they would respect my decision of quitting smoking, as the liquor flows they will eventually constantly offer me smokes. 

I can already see myself bargaining with drunk-self "just five for the night would be fine", "maybe whenever someone offers" etc.

I'm also worried about being left alone if they all end up going out to smoke :( 

For those who have experienced what I will be going through, what has been effective? Any good mental or physical reminders that is almost fool-proof?

I'm probably psyching myself out. Hopefully the temptations won't be as bad as my mind is making it to be?

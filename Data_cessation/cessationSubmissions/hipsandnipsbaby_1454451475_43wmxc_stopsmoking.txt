Day 1 and why I am quitting for good.

I was driving home from work a few minutes ago, smoking a cigarette of course, when I passed a bus stop. An elderly woman hooked up to an oxygen tank was sitting there smoking a butt, coughing her lungs out.

I immediately threw mine out, pulled over into a gas station, and threw the rest of my pack away. Along with it were all the empty packs in my car and all of the lighters I had on me. 

I downloaded a quit smoking app, and according to it I've already saved 30 cents and a little under an hour of my life.

I'm ready, and I'm looking forward to when I can say I'm no longer a smoker.

Well, made it 14 days, and I feel like crap.

I started smoking while in Afghanistan, and I enjoyed it. I knew the whole time that I intended to quit when I got home. And, here I am at week 2, and literally everything is pissing me off. My wife was aware of my habit while I was gone, and she expected me to stop immediately, cold turkey as soon as I got back. I don't mind her expecting me to quit, but I've been feeling like I'm 15 again, and sometimes I swear I get the urge to smoke out of spite. Anywho, that's the end of my rant, maybe next week will be better.

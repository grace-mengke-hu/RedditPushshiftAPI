Day 2 - the wall

I made it to work without stopping for a pack. Goal #1 achieved. Goal #2 making it through lunch, then home, then to bed. Focusing on: how good it feels to not give big tobacco that $8 this morning, how pissed I am at how much cigs OWN me. I will not smoke today no matter what. This sucks, but I know it will pass.

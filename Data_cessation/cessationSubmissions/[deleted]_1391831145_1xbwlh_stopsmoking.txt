Another minor victory.

I've done okay having a beer here and there now that I've stopped smoking. It's been 16 days. Last night my friend dropped off a six-pack to thank me for a favor, and we each had one, leaving four beers left. I was so busy at work today that I did not have a chance to have breakfast or lunch, but so wiped out and stressed out that when I came home, I reached for one of the leftover beers. One lead to drinking the rest, and I decided that I wanted more, so I decided to head out of my NYC apartment to the bodega on the corner.

It is cold and I am more drunk than I probably should be (likely because I haven't eaten all day) and I walk to to bodega. I grab a six pack and I recognize the man behind the counter. I have lived in the neighborhood for three years, and we are cool with each other. Because we are cool with each other, he will sell me single cigarettes at a discount, and packs that fell off the back of a truck. I have seen him nearly every day for a long time.

Whenever I told myself I'd cut down on smoking, I would stop buying packs and simply buy a single (or two or four) at a time from this guy because I was stupid enough to think that I could just handle one.  Of course, now I know better, and I know I can't have just one. The past couple weeks, I've avoided the bodega because if I know if I go in even for a bottle of water, he will ask me how many singles I want. 

But tonight I wanted beer. And I went in to buy beer. And I gave him exact change for the beer, and he tried to palm me a single cigarette. "Nah I'm good," I told him. 

"No, free," he said in his broken English. 

"I quit!" I said, and I headed out the door with my beer. 

"Oh!" he said, a tad chagrined but with a proud smile. And I'm proud of myself. I conquered another trigger tonight, and this beer is fucking delicious.

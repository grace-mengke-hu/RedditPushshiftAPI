Part time smoker trying to quit before I get worse!

This is day 1 of me quitting smoking. For a bit of background; I'm a 19yo student from the UK who has been smoking approx 50 cigs a week (easier to calculate weekly as the amount I smoked depended on whether I was out drinking) for the last three years. 

Like the title says I'm not a true full time smoker, and don't intend to be, which is the whole reason for doing this. I was that person who told myself "I don't count as one of these 'real' smokers, just a social smoker, the amount I smoke isn't that harmful at all" but today I've woken up and realised how stupid that is. Also my Dad has recently quit smoking after 33 years of 15-20 a day, so if he can do it, why the hell can't I?

I've gone for the strategy of swapping over to e-cigs, but not as a permanent solution. I just figured it would be good to immediately stop smoking tobacco for now and swap to electronic ones, then slowly get off the e cigs hopefully.

I'm relatively new to reddit, but I've really enjoyed reading the entries in this sub-reddit since I made an account, so thought I'd contribute myself (:

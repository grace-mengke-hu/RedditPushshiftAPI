Day 10

I feel pretty okay. Started my cycle surprisingly early this month and I gotta tell you, quitting smoking *while* PMSing is a terrible combination that I wouldn't recommend. I feel a lot calmer now than I have for the past few days. 

At first I only told my two closest friends that I was quitting, now I've told my parents and siblings, plus a couple random friends. I didn't want to tell anyone before, in case I embarrassed myself by immediately failing. 

I'm still thinking about smoking like *all* the time - yesterday I was fumbling around in my car, looking for my cigarettes, without even realizing what I was looking for - but my mood has stabilized, so that's something.

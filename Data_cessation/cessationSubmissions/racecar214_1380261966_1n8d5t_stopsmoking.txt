Just had my very first cigarette :<

I'm 21 years old (female) and I've never been a smoker, and up until now, I might have smoked collectively... 1 cigarette in my life. Lately I've been really curious and craving them, and a close friend and I just had a cigarette, and I actually smoked. I feel so guilty and bad because I know I'd be disappointing people, but it felt good to smoke..to finally do it. I got the nicotine buzz and was actually smoking a cigarette and felt good. On a side note,  I might be a little depressed right now because of a few things going on in my life, but I need someone to tell me not to do it again. I know I will jeopardize my health and a lot of things in it if I continue to.  I hope this is the right place to talk about it.

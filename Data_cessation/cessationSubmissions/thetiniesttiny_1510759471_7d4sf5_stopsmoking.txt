Just bought a pack. Haven’t wanted a cigarette this badly in a while.

I quit smoking sometime around March of this year. Randomly decided to quit-I don’t really even remember the exact date. Anyway some recent issues have made me want to smoke so badly. In the last month and a half, I’ve discovered that my grandfather sexual abused several children in the family for years (there is legal action pending but it’s taking a while). Then two days ago, I found out my stepmother has a brain tumor. Operation tomorrow. Need something to relieve the stress of the past couple of months.

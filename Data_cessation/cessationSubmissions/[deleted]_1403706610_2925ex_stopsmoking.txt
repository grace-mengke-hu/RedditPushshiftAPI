Tips for dealing with weekend temptation?

Hi, I'm new! Just got my little badge thing up and wanted to ask: how did you deal with the temptation to smoke on the weekend, especially at parties? How do you coach yourself out of the "I'll just have ONE!" rationale??
I got through the first weekend using an NRT (Nicorette spray) but after reading more on the nic addiction I want to get off that too. Today is day 2 nic free (halfway through day 6 smoke free!) and I'm feeling ok but we just got invited up to a friend's cottage for the long weekend :O 
I really want to go but I'm feeling nervous about how I am going to manage to keep quit throughout a long weekend of partying. I haven't told anyone about my quit since I was a closet smoker for years so I can't easily just tell everyone to not smoke near me. I guess I could just stay inside but I want to be able to deal with it, not avoid it.
I'm wondering if anyone has any tips on how to coach myself mentally through the weekend to not smoke, NOT EVEN ONE. Also, what are some helpful ways to talk myself out of the whole "I'll just have ONE!" mentality?

Quit almost 4 months ago, and my hangovers are terrible now.

My hangovers used to be bad, lay in bed all day and nap kind of hangovers, but since I've quit I can drink 3-4 drinks and will be throwing up and not even able to drink water the next day. I eat ice chips and have quit drinking in excess because of this. While not bad, I miss being able to go out with friends and just drink without dying the next day. 

Has this happened to anyone else?

If this matters, I smoked for 9 years a pack a day and quit cold turkey. My boyfriend it just changed the way my body handles alcohol but I'm just so confused.

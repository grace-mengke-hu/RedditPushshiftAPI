Emotions going cray

I thought I was going crazy until I searched this sub and found that apparently people cry all the time.  I haven't had very many "cravings," like where I think "I need a cigarette."  I have been hulking out and almost crying for like two days now for no good reason though.  I was on imgur at work this morning and almost every single post made me get to the verge of tears.  Granted, most of it was about Robin Williams death, but his death isn't really affecting me the way is seems to be affecting other people so I found it very odd.  Then later I was doing yoga and just hulked out and started crying.  It made no sense. I'm aware that my emotions are going cray but I literally can't do anything to stop them.  It feels like insane PMS and I feel much better knowing that it is completely normal.

Week 1: So far so good. Controlling my environment one experience at a time. Kinda enjoy it.

Thanks for the motivation guys. I'm just trying to put myself in as many situations and experiences that had made me wanna smoke.

1) College (Hard)  -  didn't smoke at all, considering half of the students smoke. Spoke to most my college friends and they love the idea of me quiting and fully support it. I won't be able to let them down, so no smoking in college.

2) Social Group 1 (Hard, Younger Group, 90% smokers)- Went out, most in the group smoked, I didn't. Just hung with the non-smoker and ignored the smokers until they finished.

3) Social Group 2 (Moderate, Mature Group, all smokers) - I motivated many people to stop smoking . They intend on doing so after the exams.

4) Females - I feel more comfortable with them without worrying about smelling like shit. Being able to smell females scent and hair it fucken amazing.

4) Home/Bored (Easy) - Whenever I crave, I just start reading this sub-Reddit or get on my phone.

Quite enjoying this challenged. Still have a few more experiences I need to get into to test my will power.

1) Raves (Hard)

2) Road Trips (Moderate)

3) After smoking weed (Easy)

Current Willpower Level: 100%. Kinda enjoying the challenge making me stronger and I am learning more about my body. Just exciting to actually breath in without coughing!

Until Next Week.

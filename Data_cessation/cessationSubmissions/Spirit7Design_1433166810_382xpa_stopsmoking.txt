Day 3...still going good!

Well, I'm into day 3 and I've only had a few cravings...nothing to terrible though.

I'm actually impressed with, I don't want to say how easy, but how not extremely difficult this has been.  I've tried several times to quit before, and haven't even made it through the whole day.  

I think what's really working for me is a combination of wanting to quit, and seeing all the people on here who have done it.  

It probably would have been several more years before I quit if I had not quite accidentally stumbled across /r/stopsmoking.  Thanks for being here!!!

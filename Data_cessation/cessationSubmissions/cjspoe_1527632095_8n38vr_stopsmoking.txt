Wish me luck

This will be my biggest test yet, the drive home from work right now. Never posted here before and I am doing writing this to hopefully keep myself accountable. I read through a lot of the responses on here and has been helpful. Last one was Friday afternoon around 3:00pmEST driving home after company cookout. I kept myself busy during the weekend and it helped i was with a girl i dont smoke around anyway. I feel like this is mainly mental, not sure if it is because I did not smoke a lot compared to other people or my body is used to "less smoking" over the weekends. . Since I was 16, i have been a casual smoker, and in the last year it has increased to a pack every two days \(i know its still low compared to others\) but it has effected me big time. The worst withdrawals i have had have been intense coughing, some stomach issues, and headaches. Anyway.. thanks &amp; hopefully good news tomorrow

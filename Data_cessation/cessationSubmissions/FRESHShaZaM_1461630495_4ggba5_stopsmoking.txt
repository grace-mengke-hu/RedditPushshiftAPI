Replacing cigarettes with something else?

I mainly just smoke cigarettes as a break from the technological and scholarly world, as a break, and a moment to enjoy some fresh air, some free thinking, complimented with the smoke of a cigarette. I literally smoke 1 or 2 a day for months now and I don't really put the smoke in my lungs, but it still worries me a little bit. I don't need them either. I can go a few days completely forgetting I smoke, usually when I'm more relaxed and have some chill time with friends and family. 

I know you all probably had similar reasons for smoking. What would you do instead for a quick relaxing break outside? Note: I already exercise regularly, gym and jogging, so I'm not in any complete longing for the outside world. I also pray regularly, go to church on Sundays, and have a relationship with God, so I'm in no spiritual longing either. It's just refreshing to me. Beer or weed is a little much to go outside for, mainly because it's usually a study break.

So happy I don't smoke anymore

Had my dentist appointment today for my cleaning. This is the first cleaning that I had when I didn't smoke from the last cleaning. My gums have improved, and my dental hygienist said that had lot less tartar on my teeth! It seemed like she didn't have to clean so extensively this time, unlike before! I freaking love it! 

I was thinking today about this. I am so lucky and happy to stop smoking those damn things. It's been over 100 days now and the change is amazing. We have rains here this week. Weather is shitty. I don't have to open my car's window anymore when it's raining, getting my inside door all wet...my car doesn't stink. In-fact, it smells so damn fresh now. I am so happy! I don't have to go outside to smoke every 45 minutes anymore! This, in itself, is just awesome. I don't have to stand there in a rain...like a fool, sucking on these things. Not to mention, pay for this experience! LOL. How freaking stupid???

You know what I do now instead? I walk the stairs. I get up from my desk and I go down from 5th floor, to the lower level and back up to 5th. Then repeat. I do this every hour. 

My clothes don't stink anymore. My life does not surround smoking. I don't make my schedule around smoking any more. I love it. I love it. I love it. 

I have been working on fixing my cardio vascular health lately. I been doing some cardio and being more active. I still experience this heavy feeling on my lungs sometimes, when I am doing cardio, but I know this will rebuild and it will go away. It just takes time. I can't expect 100% turn around in 100 days after 23 years of abusing my lungs. 

I so wish I never smoked before or stopped this fucking madness long time ago. What a nasty nasty nasty habit.

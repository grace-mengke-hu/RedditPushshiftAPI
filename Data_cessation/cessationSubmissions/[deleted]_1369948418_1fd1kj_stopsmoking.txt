Goddamnit

I've quit so many times now. I've been here a lot, giving out helpful pointers. Advice that seem to touch people. But I can't seem to follow them myself. My biggest problem right now has been that I've been able to go without them no problem. I don't buy a pack. I stay without them for a few hours, days even. Then I meet one of my friends. They all smoke. It's always "Hey can I bum one from you?", thinking I can handle it. Again and again and again and again and again and again. And all of a sudden I'm right back at the beginning. I have exams coming up and it's taking a toll. I want to quit, here and now. Forever. So why do I keep turning back to them? I have all of Carr's advice in the back of my head. They work. Until I disobey.

This isn't coherent, or looking for advice, or anything really. I just want to vent. Fuck you cigarettes. Fuck you tobacco companies. Fuck you addiction. I'm quitting. I dunno when. Soon. After exams I guess. But I can't even afford to smoke all through exams. Fuck.

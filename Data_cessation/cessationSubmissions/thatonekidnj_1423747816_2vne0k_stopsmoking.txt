Just quit last night. Now I have questions.

I have been smoking for 7 years I just quit last night as I notice while at work when talking to customers that I was out of breath when I talked. It scares me that being out of breath is so easy now whether it be talking or walking. Plus it was too much money to keep this habit and I'm hoping it helps other aspects of my life.

Questions:
Does NRT work? 
Is it better to go cold turkey?
Does nicotine cause restricted blood flow or is it the smoke in general?
Will I have weird phlegm to cough up or anything like that?
Will I get sick?

P.S. I'm 21 years old and was smoking a pack a day.

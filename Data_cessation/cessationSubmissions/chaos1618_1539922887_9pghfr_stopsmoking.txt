A few lessons on cold turkey.

Idk if cold turkey is one of the effective strategies to quit (statistically), but it sure as hell worked for me. I've always had faith in cold turkey, and despite failing at it at least a 100 times, I finally succeeded with the same strategy.

The saying, "it's foolish to expect different results repeating the same method", seemed inadequate in acknowledging the strengths of determination, will and perseverance.

But the success of cold turkey has subtle but far reaching consequences in other domains of Life. For instance, when it comes to letting go of any other bad habit, I tend to replicate the cold turkey mantra. In doing so, I end up prolonging the bad habit for much longer than I might otherwise. Because cold turkey is bound to produce repeated failures in the beginning. It's also important to understand that cold turkey is an extreme path. 
Another problem with cold turkey is that we usually use a special occasion to enforce cold turkey. It's very common to think that, "I'll quit cold turkey from tomorrow no matter what. So let me indulge today as much as I can. It'll be a clean slate from tomorrow morning." So this actually aggravates the intensity of vice (until the day you do actually succeed).
The last problem with cold turkey is the vulnerability to relapse. Cold turkey doesn't make you relapse. But if and when you do relapse due to other reasons, because of your cold turkey history, you're likely to once again use the same weapon. Again, I'm not sure if this is an efficient strategy.

My fellow quitters and quitteresses, did you find any similar repercussions of your quitting strategy onto other domains of your life?

All said and done, you gotta do it if you gotta do it come what may. Good luck dear good people!

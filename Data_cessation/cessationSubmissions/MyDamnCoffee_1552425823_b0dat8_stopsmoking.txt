I am choosing not to spend our last $11 on cigarettes

My brain is screaming at me "you need to smoke! You're going to snap and walk out of your job!"

Which may be true. My job is extremely stressful. I mean like I get nauseous thinking about being there and I cry every day I work. I promised a supervisor that I adore that I would give it six months. I have 5 months left to go but chances are I won't make it. If I walk out because I snap during nicotine withdrawal it won't be the worst thing ever. Might actually be all around good for me haha. Minus the being broke stuff. Anywho.

I just got paid on Thursday but spent my entire paycheck on car repairs after --- on Thursday --- I had to smash out my car window when I locked my child and phone inside while it was running because the driver's side door handle was broken and the passenger side locks automatically.

So we are down to  $11 after a belated birthday day trip took  $20 yesterday. I can't keep my prepaid phone on and it will shut off tomorrow and my pregnant cat is gonna need food, as well as needing gas to get to my terrible job.

If I didn't need to smoke I feel like we might be almost ok with  $11. I might need to borrow gas money in a week or so. My car does great on gas.

I want to quit so badly.

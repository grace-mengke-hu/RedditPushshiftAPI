Stopped smoking 3 days ago. I miss smoking and am asking for advice.

I realize I’m craving nicotine, but I also just really MISS smoking.

I miss smoking before and after work. I miss having a little break to smoke in the middle of my shift. I miss going outside to smoke on my patio. I miss it after eating, while driving, while drinking coffee, while talking on the phone. I could write a sonnet about it. 

I never realized how ingrained it was in my life. I’m not giving in and am definitely NOT going to start smoking again. I guess I just wanted some advice about these feelings. Are you or have you ever felt this? This romanticizing smoking? Would love to hear your stories and perspectives.

Most importantly, does it EVER go away? I know I’m being dramatic since it’s only been 3 days, but I just wanted to hear something to make me look forward to the future. Will I always forever be wanting something I cannot have?

Thanks so much! ❤️

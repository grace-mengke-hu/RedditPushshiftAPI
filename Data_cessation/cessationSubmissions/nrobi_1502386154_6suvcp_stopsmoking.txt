Quitting and Social Life

I'm not too far along my journey, but I've noticed over the last several days a surprising new reason I LOVE being quit: no more sneaking.

I hated, hated, hated being "caught" smoking. Very few people in my life, professional and personal, smoke anymore. I would walk around campus (I'm a grad student) with a lit cigarette and when I'd see some one I knew coming, instead of saying hello I'd hide around the corner. I'd delay hanging out with my girlfriend and my family so I could smoke more freely. I'd even wander around the neighborhood while I smoked so my next door neighbors wouldn't see the extend of my habit.

I went to a wedding last weekend. It was the first major social event in years where I didn't have to stress about finding a spot to sneak off to.  And the first event in years where I didn't worry about smelling like cigarettes.

For most people, this is probably less of a big deal. But for me it's been a huge relief.

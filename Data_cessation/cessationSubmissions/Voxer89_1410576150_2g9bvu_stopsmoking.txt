Third times a charm...

That's me hit the end of day three of my third attempt to quit smoking over the past 8 years. Previous two attempts both made it to 6 weeks, however the first one ended in a drunken rager and the second after one to many blue's :/.
Hoping to boss it this time and i've also started running for the first time since i was 16; i am 24 atm; which i also started two days ago as i am joining the RAF but have at least 6 months to get fitness up, things are looking up and i'm feeling positive (whilst at the same time hating anything and everything and wanting to adorn one of these bad boys, http://industrialanatomy.files.wordpress.com/2009/04/smoke_rescue_helmets9.jpg, and attach it to a bowl of 150g pueblo)

TWO YEARS!! If I can do it, you can do it, /r/stopsmoking. Trust me.

Never thought I'd make it to this point, yet here I am. And it feels fucking GREAT. I can honestly say I don't think I'd have made it this far without this sub. Thank you so much, /r/stopsmoking.  Here's what worked for me:

* Constantly checking this sub. Putting in a start date here, and in google calendar with a yearly repeat to mark each clean year. Always checking these things to remind myself that I made a commitment.

* When I first started, whenever I had a craving I'd do 10 pushups. It's good exercise, plus it distracts your mind for the amount of time it takes to lose the craving. This is true: the cravings are only momentary, they will not last longer than a few minutes at a time. Make it past that tiny time slot and you are GOOD. TO. GO.

* TELL EVERYONE YOU KNOW THAT YOU ARE QUITTING. If your friends aren't assholes they will encourage you, even if they are smokers themselves. This adds more incentive to keep it up as you don't want to disappoint them, and also the encouragement is a huge help.

* This one is rough, but kind of essential. If you're single, seek out non-smokers. The hardest obstacle to get around is when other people around you are smoking. Stay. Away. None of my friends smoke and I'm very grateful for that - I can only imagine how much harder it would have been to quit. That being said, if you can't help but be surrounded by smokers, take note of how they smell (bad) and how much they cough (probably a lot). Remind yourself that you're ALREADY HEALTHIER THAN THEM.

* Life is so much easier to live when you're healthy. Quitting smoking is the best first step to self-improvement you can make.

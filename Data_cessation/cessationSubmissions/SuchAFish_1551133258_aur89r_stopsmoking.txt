Smoke free for 6 months! My story and some insight

6 months ago I decided to quit smoking cold turkey. It was the third or fourth attempt within 10 years (am 27y old), and I'm happy to say that I made it through, even though the following two months after August were stressful and eventful - new job in a leading position, moving into a new home, found out my father was betraying my mother and they broke up, new responsibilities and challenges - yet for some reason it was easier than ever before to stop smoking. The first three days were absolutely terrible, I woke up in the night and was feeling down like never before and I felt very nauseous. After two weeks the need to lit a cigarette almost ceased completely and by now the cravings are gone. I remember how it was like when I look at a cigarette, but I have absolutely no urges to smoke one, and boy was it worth it:

My pulsatile tinnitus and hyperacusis are completely gone, I started actually gaining some weight (by 10 kilograms, am ectomorph), overall better well-being and when outside, I smell things I haven't smelled in a long time, especially when around grass and on rainy days. Food slowly started to taste different, especially cheese (not sure if it is because I have quit though), my appetite however improved. 
Oddly enough I never had to cough, and it is also weird that I .

Once I managed to stop smoking for two weeks, but didn't make it when I was drunk. I suppose alcohol does not really pair well when trying to quit, if it does lower inhibitions.

Perhaps it does help when trying to quit if you leave one or more other things behind, especially when you enter a new stage in your life. That's just the impression I have, though - previously I always assumed the opposite to be the case.

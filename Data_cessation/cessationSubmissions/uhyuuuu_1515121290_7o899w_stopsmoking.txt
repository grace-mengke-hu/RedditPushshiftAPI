The nicotine monster can f*ck off.

Been a smoker for the last couple of years, usually coudlnt survive a day without smoking. Decided that it was enough since I didnt wanna die before my Mom, cant imagine the pain shell go through.

Wrote a letter to myself for whenever I get a craving, thought I'll share it here.

You’re probably reading this cuz you wanna smoke a cigerrette, it might be a bad day, it might be just because you’re bored, it might be cuz you feel lonely, it might be cuz you feel empty. 
The only thing that I can tell you are those are just excuses, you know that. Don’t smoke. It isn’t worth it, I want you to live a long happy life. Tell the Nicotine monster to suck my dick. 

Steps to get over a craving
1. Drink water
2. Tell the nicotine monster to fuck off 
3. Go back to doing whatever you were doing.

The worst thing about smoking is that the nicotine monster is a part of you now, which has been growing over the time you’ve been smoking.
It’s the monster that tells me you to smoke even when you know you shouldnt, it’s the monster that tells you how the moment can only be better if you had a cigerrette in your hand. 
It tells you to spend all the hard earned money by your you.
It tells you to smoke another one even when your throat doesn’t work. 
To that monster we say “Suck my Dick”.

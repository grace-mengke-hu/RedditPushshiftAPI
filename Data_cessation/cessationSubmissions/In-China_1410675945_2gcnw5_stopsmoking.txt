I finally quit.

A little info about me: 1 year+ lurker here. previously smoked 1-2 packs a day. heavier when in social situations. tried vap before but I ended up going through a month's vap supply in a week.

Recently I have wanted to quit for a long time, but it just didn't happen. I remember I would see the posts in this subreddit (while smoking) and think 'if it were only that easy...'

Aside from previously smoking, I have mostly good habits -- no caffeine, no soda, almost no alcohol, but it was a month and a half ago that I went to a friend's birthday party. That day I smoked so many cigarettes!! I smoked so many that the next day I felt disgusted by the thought of smoking!

I went on for 2-3 days with this disgusted feeling, and after that I caught a fever which hit me pretty bad. It took me a week and a half to recover and it wasn't until after I got well that I realized 'hey! I have been smoke free for almost two weeks!'.

At that point I had to go on several business trips that were really busy -- so busy that I even forgot about smoking! 

Eventually I got back. The deciding point came.
I was at dinner with friends and everyone started smoking. A friend said 'hey try out this new brand I got from overseas' 

I didn't try it.

Since then I have been consciously staying away from cigarettes. I have already run into a lot of challenges (I literally felt like a vampire trying to stop his urge for fresh blood when I saw people smoking my favorite cigarette ever -- malboro ice blast) but feel very optimistic now.

I know myself. In the past I have quit before... only to start again because of "*just one cigarette*". I know that I can't have *just one cigarette*. It's either you smoke, or you don't.

I know that it is very possible that I one day will succumb. But for now, I am enjoying life smoke free.

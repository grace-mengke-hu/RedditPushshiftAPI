I drank beer without smoking last night...

... and it feels awesome! A friend of mine even had cigarettes, and i did not ask her for one! (Though i did warn her that i might and told her not to give me one if that would be the case.)
I am so happy that i won't have to reset my badge and soon i will be a week smoke free! Happy life :D

10 days in... is this normal? Anyone else experience this?

So it's been 10 days without a cigarette. My resting heartrate is now lower than it was when was smoking. When I smoked, resting was around 90bpm now it's around 60-70. Blood pressure is lower (as far as I can tell) Is this normal? 

I also get VERY tired mid-late afternoon. This never happened when I smoked. I get so tired  - sometimes to the point where I am going to just collapse and pass out, or need to take a nap. I don't nap. I've never taken a nap in my adult life. 

Anyone else experience similar?

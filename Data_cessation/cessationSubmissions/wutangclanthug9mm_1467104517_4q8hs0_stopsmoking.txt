Waiting for the other shoe to drop...

I was a smoker for about 18 years and yesterday marked 3 weeks without smoking a ciggy after I quit cold turkey.

The funny thing is... These last 554 hours have been a cakewalk.  I haven't had a craving like at all.  Like at all.

I'm sorry if I come off as insensitive to a lot of you here, as I read your stories and understand how much of a struggle this can be for us.  (And by the way, thank you all for your inspiration and courage)

But I'm concerned that a deep craving for a cigarette is going to hit me like a ton of bricks somewhere down the line.

I've been fidgeting with a yo yo and puffing on a blu e-cig every once in a while and I've been perfectly content but I really didn't expect it to be this easy knock wood.

Also is it cheating to do a little vapey vape?

Keep up the good work everyone!

I can't seem to do it again.

I quit for a full year in 2014, but with an e-cig. 

In 2016 I quit for a solid 6 months, cold turkey. It was great. How did I start up again? Gradually, bumming off coworkers, then bumming so much I graduated to buying them packs....then that spilled into buying packs again. Within a week I am back to a pack a day. 

Have a great Christmas this year and started 2018 with no cigs. Lasted a month, and within 2 days of smoking again, I am back at a pack a day. 

Now my intake has increased even more, I'm smoking more than ever, I can feel it destroying my lungs. I want to quit so bad yet, at the same time, feel I have the lowest motivation to quit. I don't want to go through it again. I know all about it, after about the 10th day of cold turkey things really start improving. But then at some point I inevitably fall back into it. It seems hopeless and worthless. I am disgusted by them and love them at the same time. I want to quit and be done with them forever yet still want to be a smoker. 

I am stuck.

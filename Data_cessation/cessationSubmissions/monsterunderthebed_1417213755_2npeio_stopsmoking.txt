Just decided to quit. Appreciate advice.

Me and my husband have been smoking for quite a while now and we just decided to quit. With how expensive things are, and for our future we decided it would be a good idea to kick the habbit. 

Honestly, I'm not too happy about it, because I actually enjoy it but I want to be healthier and happier and even have my sense of smell back.

I'd appreciate any tips/tricks/etc to get me through the next couple of days. We're actually swapping to vapping/e-cigs to ween us off so it won't be a complete nicotine withdrawl.

How long does depression last?

I've quit cold turkey for a little over two weeks now after smoking for 10 years and I've noticed that I've been feeling pretty depressed lately and don't really want to socialise or see anyone.

I get why it's happening and I'm not worried. I would just like to know how long this generally lasts?

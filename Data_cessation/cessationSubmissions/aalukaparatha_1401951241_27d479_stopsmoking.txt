I start coughing whenever some one even mentions the word "Cigarettes"

I stopped smoking 21 days ago and now when ever I see some one smoking in the street or at a pub or some one even talking about cigarettes, I get a gag reflex and start coughing. Is this normal? Why is it happening? Do I have a psychological problem? Any advice would be appreciated.

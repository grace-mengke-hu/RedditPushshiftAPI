Recently picked up smoking. This sub is making me stop

I've smoked a few here and there but really picked the habit up in a moment of weakness around June.  Since then, I've noticed a clear decline in my general well being.  I don't and never have smoked a large amount, but I feel groggy and lethargic every time I do.

In October I decided to quit before I got too deep, but today I'm putting a number to it.   Tossed my last smoke I normally would have had before work after a few puffs, so I have to deal with a change in habit in a situation where I can't go back, at least for a few hours.

Wish me luck, and keep the stories coming.  Hearing everyone else on the same grind is good motivation.

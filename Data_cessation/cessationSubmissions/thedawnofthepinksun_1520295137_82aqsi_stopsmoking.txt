Weed with tobacco fucked up 90% of my quits.

You cannot smoke it together at the same time and quit tobacco. Even after a while. I quit cigs on 8th february and after a while started smoking spliffs. 98% of these shitty weed friends will tell you that it won't do you harm. Most of people who smoke weed out of control I think are just being manipulated by synergy of tobacco-weed. It isn't even enjoyment, it's kind of a numbing down of both positive-negative experiences, isolation and mental lag.  I've asked myself if I'm mentally stable smoking splifs all day while not smoking cigarettes and at the same time negated the effect of tobacco.. I was going through a state of light withdrawal constantly and then smoking a spliff.  Now I am not even sure what I want?  I was high  this saturday on E and amp and I shared some cigarettes with friends and I don't know if I want to handle more nicotine withdrawals even though they are light. But while I was high I just liked being social with people and sharing something. Though I know one thing for sure that these false hopes, drugs and false friends turned off my mind from reality.. I've sucessfully created an equation that equates pleasure from cigarettes in head=pain in lungs.. And even after relapsing I find that the pleasure of smoking quickly goes away in like 1-3 days and it becomes just an annoying have to do routine while you get disappointed about constantly relapsing.

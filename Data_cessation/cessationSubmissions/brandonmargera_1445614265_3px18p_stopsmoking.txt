Quitting now before it's too late

I've just gone a week without smoking. Haven't done that since I was about 15. Now I'm 19. After being diagnosed with Crohn's disease in April 2014 and despite the hospital's warnings, I continued to smoke. There was a time a few months when I thought for sure I was about to be told I had stomach cancer (long story). Then I started university a bit over a month ago and actually upped the amount of cigarettes I was having from about 5-7 to 15-20 a day; for at least a couple of weeks. 7 days ago, I had a CT scan and was told that either the medication I've been taking has worked liked a miracle or more likely that I was misdiagnosed with Crohn's in the first place. I could stop taking some of my medication and things looked a lot less sinister for the first time in a while. I walked out of the hospital, looked in my pocket and saw that I had enough tobacco left for just one cigarette. I rolled it and started walking towards the corner shop to buy some more. And then, kind of instantly, I decided that this was the day I'd finally stop. I threw the cigarette away, went into the shop and bought an e-cig. It's been a week and I just feel so much better already. Mostly because I'm coughing significantly less.

Looking back, I didn't get anything good out of smoking. It's just a burden. I really hope it isn't something that I'm going to fall back into. I really don't want this addiction hovering right above for the rest of my life but part of me really thinks it will. I guess that's the price you pay. At least my smoking has completely put off both my younger siblings from ever wanting to themselves. Sorry for the rant.

3 days in and caved

I was doing really well and I was feeling extremely determined, and then suddenly last night my mood took a total turn. I was suddenly so angry and frustrated and flipped out on friend over nothing. After they left I bought a pack and justified it by saying I'd buy a pack for my dad, have one, and not touch the rest. I'm really determined today to not touch them. I'm pretty disappointed I caved, but I have to make it past the cravings. 

Also, how do you guys deal with that "on edge" feeling? That kills me.

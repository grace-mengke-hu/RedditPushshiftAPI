I have a question...

I have been off cigarettes for a  bit.  I don't count but the last cigarette I remember smoking was about two months ago.  My question to you all is that I heard that I would be coughing up a bunch of black gunk (tar?) and I have not,  is this normal? A bunch of friends who quit say they all have coughed up a bunch of black crap after quitting and its because their lungs were getting rid of the residue from smoking.  I have never had this happen after quitting and was wondering if this was some sort of myth or if there is some truth behind it.

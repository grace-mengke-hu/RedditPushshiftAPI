Quitting this Sunday

A little info about me.. I'm a 34 year old male working as a professional musician.  Right now I'm performing 5 nights a week in a super smokey club.  I've been an on and off again smoker since I was about 17.  

I just read Allen Carr's EasyWay in it's entirety today.. I'm getting really excited!  I've quit in the past many times.. sometimes it's easy, sometimes it's not.  Either way, I'm feeling determined and looking forward to relaxing and ridding myself of my nicodemon with the new perspective I have on smoking from Carr's book.  

Sunday and Monday are my days off so I figure it will be easiest to start then.  I'll have to perform (playing/singing) every night starting on day 3.. I'll be surrounded by it at the club.  I'm most worried about work because it's when my cravings reaches peak anxiety levels.  Any tips?  I think I'm just going to drink a ton of water and juice the whole time and try to breathe through the cravings.  

Cold turkey, baby! Here we go.

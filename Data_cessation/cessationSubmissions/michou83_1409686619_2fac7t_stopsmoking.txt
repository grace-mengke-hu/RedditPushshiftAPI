Day One... Scared to fail like always

Hey everyone!  I've been a smoker for 11 years and for serious health reasons I've finally decided to quit. I've tried plenty of times before and have always lapsed back. I'm hoping I can finally make it stick. The biggest issue I always seem to face is the severe anxiety I always get in the first week or two of my quit. Any suggestions on how to keep calmer?  Thanks for being such an awesome subreddit!

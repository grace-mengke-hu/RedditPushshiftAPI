Oh bollocks...

so, after 80 hours, I decided to get drunk at a work quiz last night and I had 2 puffs of a cig! It was strange, I had 2 tokes and I hated it, it felt like my cleansed soul turned instantly black, really strange and surreal feeling, so today I feel pretty guilty. Absolutely know I wont be smoking again, but i do think I'm going to lay off the booze for a little while!

but do I need to reset my badge? will those 2 tokes of filled me up with nicotine? Warning people, even if you feel great, just watch out! it was so easy for me to just take a puff. Be on guard always!

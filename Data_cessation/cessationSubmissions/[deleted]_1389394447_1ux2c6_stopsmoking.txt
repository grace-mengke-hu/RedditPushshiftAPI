Just a (probably incoherent) rant at about 20.5 hours cold turkey, on accident.

Hi guys! Ugh, rough day(and it started so well intentioned!)! This morning I finally signed up to use a crossfit groupon I bought four months ago because it is about to expire. I decided I should finally invest in a vaporizer because I could not imagine that I will be able to quit cold turkey and trying to do crossfit sounds unpleasant enough without the added stress of cigarettes! Well, strangely, trying to buy a vaporizer turned into this hugely overwhelming mission and here I am now. Obsessed with smoking, but wondering if I should just hold out for the day and get it done. The strength of my cravings and my physical symptoms are actually really freaking me out; I've smoked for about 8 years and this is not my first rodeo with quitting. I attribute a lot of the real "addiction" switch getting flipped in my brain to starting vyvanse (it's a lot like adderal) over the past year. It really changed smoking for me as well as a lot of other things (most of which were very positive, but I know I am now addicted to vyvanse, too). So here I am... I ordered a vaporizer. I feel like I will not be able to function at all today if I don't smoke, but really whats worse? The other sort of funny thing is, I ordered the vaporized with very strong nicotine. Anyways, this is just frustrated rambling to keep me from going out to smoke or something. Another funny thing is, because I live in Washington where tobacco is very expensive, I've been stock piling cartons for a while now when I travel to where they are cheaper. They are all just staring at me from a shelf now. Ughhhhhh.

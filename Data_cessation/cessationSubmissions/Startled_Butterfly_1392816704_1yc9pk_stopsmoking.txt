I'm doing it. Today.

Fuck cigarettes. I don't need them. Smoking for almost two years, consciously trying to cut down for two months. Cutting down was going really well through January, then the last few days it's been pretty bad again. It's a hard thing to control, so I'm just going to do it for real and quit.

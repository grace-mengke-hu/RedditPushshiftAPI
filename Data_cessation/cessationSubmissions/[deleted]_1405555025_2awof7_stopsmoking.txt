Don't get torpedoed.

Don't get torpedoed once you've quit, sidestep the bullshit and focus on you, and let the world wait a moment. 


I just got a voice mail from a sibling I've not talked to in a couple years, admonishing me for never calling (I called a few weeks back and left a message) and then breaking into tears about having to put their dog down. 

Fuck me. You're joking. I can't deal with that right now, I'm up to my tits in detox near the end of day three. It's not a dead parent, so it can wait. 
I texted that "I'm in a wee bit of shitstorm myself at the moment, call tomorrow, hang tight"...


Anyway, it was like a fucking clarion was sounded for cigarettes. It rang clear oh brothers and down to the follicle it resounds. Fuck. No. I'm not smoking, my sibling will have to wait, I'd be no good anyhow, I'm not being selfish I'm being pragmatic. I'm not letting this shit torpedo me.

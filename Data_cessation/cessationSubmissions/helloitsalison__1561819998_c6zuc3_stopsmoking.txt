Day four and a half. Peak anxiety. Halp.

Truly, I just laid on the floor for 35 minutes because my anxious brain is having a complete meltdown over... which sandals to wear. So embarrassing. 

This might be worse than cravings or headaches. Anyone else feel this anxiety spike? This is above all my biggest trigger and the first time Iâ€™m not sure how to work through it with other things. 

Sorry for this complaint rant, just needed to vent it out. You all are great and kicking ass.

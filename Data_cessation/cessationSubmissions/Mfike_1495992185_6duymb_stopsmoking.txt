Still Going Strong

I have been smoke free for over 100 days after smoking for 17 years. Somedays I don't miss it at all... other days i have to remind myself of the things I have gained!  For those of you struggling in those first few hours/days/weeks this may help-

My teeth are so much better!  My dental hygienist asked me if I quit smoking before I could say anything because she could tell a big difference!

When I jog my legs get sore long before I am out of breath!!  When I smoked I couldn't jog bc I thought I would pass out!

My house is cleaner!  I never smoked in my home- but not going in and out of the house I swear has made my floors seem cleaner!

I have so much more time. I didn't realize I spent an hour at home each night smoking! I spend my extra time playing with my kids, walking the dog, going to the gym etc.

Hangovers are not so bad anymore!  I didn't drink the first 30 days of my quit- it was just too hard.  But I'm ok now- and a hangover is not as bad!

It hasn't been easy- but it's been manageable!

asthmatic and trying to quit... one week in and the cough has me wanting to start back

hello reddit.... 
im wondering if any of you have the same experience, and hopefully some advice...

so i got hooked on the cigs because ive been smoking the green leaf, and over here its practice to mix it with tobacco.... im a week off both, the nicotine withdrawl has me all kinds of weepy, this was expected.... 

but the smokers cough, my lungs clearing themselves out i guess, has me at my wits end... ive had a near constant background wheeze for the past few days and am barely sleeping being up all night coughing... has anybody encountered a strategy that will help?

Stopped smoking in January again but smoked again shortly after. Now I just smoked my last one and I'm in again - I'll do this!

So, as the title says, I was a non-smoker for about a year from christmasn 2014 to november 2015, when I lost my job and was unemployed. 

I hate myself for smoking again, but never stopped until today. In May I'm going on holiday to Florida and the cigarettes in the US are so damn expensive, so I'll not smoke from today again.

Keep your head up, even if you fail and just do it again, trust me, it's totally worth it!

Sorry for my bad english, just wanted to tell my short story, haha!

I have no idea where to start quitting...

Hi all. I'm 22 and have been smoking for four years now. I'm facing some medical problems and my doctor chastised me today for smoking. I need to quit. I hate smoking and only do it because I feel like I need to. It doesn't help that I live with my boyfriend, a fellow smoker.  I don't know if cold turkey will work for me and I don't want anything non-OTC. Honestly,  I'm scared to quit. I hardly ever see any goal through. I'm too afraid to try and then fail.  How do I take that first step?

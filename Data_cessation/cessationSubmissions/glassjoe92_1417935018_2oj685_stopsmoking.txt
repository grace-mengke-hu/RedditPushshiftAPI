Question about benefits moving to e-cigarette (temporarily)

So I've been smoking these things by Swisher Sweets called BLK Smooths for the past two years or so (after having moved over from cigarettes). They've since gotten out of control to where I was smoking 2-8 per day. These are essentially the same as Black and Mild cigarillos.

My friend just gave me his e-cigarette, as he purchased a nicer one recently. I've managed to stay away from my cigars for the past two days. The e-cigarette has 1.2 nicotine.

I know that supposedly after 8 hours of quitting smoking certain things happen, then days, weeks, months, and years later other risks are reduced and the body is repaired. Will this progression begin when I'm smoking an ecig or does it only start once I stop consuming nicotine? Does anyone know? I plan to ween off of this thing eventually because I don't believe they're entirely safe, but a lot safer than cigars. 

Either way, I'm just glad I'm not dropping $1-4 a day on cigars anymore and countless money driving back roads for the sole purpose of smoking them. That probably saves me another $5 a day by not driving around. Excited to have an extra $100-200 in my budget every month.

How I feel

I'm now 3 days in without a cigarette. I feel like I'll always have a a craving to put my favorite brand between my fingers and light up. I'm not sure how I'll cope after a meal, after I do something creative, or drinking with friends. I feel like I'll always want that brand. I'm brainwashed into believing I really want it and I'll never be myself without it.

I quit yesterday. Question.

I only smoked for abut 5-6 years but before I quit, I became a heavy chainsmoker and was even sometimes up to two packs a day (mostly those little Sante Fe cigars) and now my breathe stinks heavily of smoke. Like, I can taste it and it's disgusting. Is that just a side effect of the tobacco leaving my system?

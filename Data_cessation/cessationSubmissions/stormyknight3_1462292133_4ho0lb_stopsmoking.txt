Round 4 - Day 2

Tried quitting 3 times using Chantix. Almost 3k later, I decided to try something else.  I'm on Day 2 of the patches, and I'm just curious what others experiences were with them? 

My anxiety is a little higher than when I did Chantix, but it's bearable. Longest I quit was the three and a half months on Chantix, but I'm hoping to go the distance this time!

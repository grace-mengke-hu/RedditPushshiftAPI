Just quit for the second time on Saturday. Stopped smoking for 4 years, started again in 2015 and here I am.

...and man does it feel weird. I'm a very anxiety-driven smoker. I really started smoking while i did military service back in 2005, smoked around a pack per day until August 2010 and quit cold turkey.

Like now, I've met a special someone back then and I feel like smoking is not only distracting me, but also affecting that relationship in a very real physical sense. If it weren't for the obvious health benefits of not smoking, I would continue. I only roll my own cigarettes... it's very ritualistic, same paper,  same filters, same tobacco.

Now, writing this, I feel like the whole ritual around it is just another excuse for keeping up the habit.

Anyway, I quit smoking before, and it all feels very similar. I think I got my act together pretty well for now. Had some physical cravings today, which sucked, but the most important part is simply not to smoke, which I accomplished. I think gifting my tobacco pouch to a friend on Saturday helped.

Well, anyway, I just wanted to ramble a bit about this.

Cheers fellows!

Oh, and the salami I had earlier tasted awesome. I forgot how quickly the taste comes back.

A new milestone

Just checking in with this sub as it's been a while. 

I haven't made it 80 days without a cigarette in well over 10 years. I've never felt more sure about quitting than this go round.

I initially vaped for a month to get off the cigs, especially when have a few drinks. Now I have quit vaping, given all of my vape stuff away and am living the nic free life. I still have a little puff of vape every now and then if I'm with a friend and we happen to be drinking or something, but I know that I have absolutely zero want or need to have a cigarette and that is a very nice feeling.

Keep quitting you quitters!

I am 19 and have been smoking for 5 years, quitting tomorrow... any tips?

So long story short, where I grew up everyone smoked, so I started smoking.

I stopped on and off for the first 2 years but the last 3 have been pretty consistent.

Iâ€™m quitting cold turkey tomorrow, any advice?

My biggest fear is falling back into it on the bad days I have, as that tends to be how it goes

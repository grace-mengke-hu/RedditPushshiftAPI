Just finished my last cigarette. Day 0 is here.

I've tried time and time again. Maybe this time will be different. E-cigarettes. Gum. Patches. Lozenges. I recently tried Chantix until my anxiety levels skyrocketed, so that's not an option. All that's left is another run at cold turkey. Something's gotta give. Wish me luck.

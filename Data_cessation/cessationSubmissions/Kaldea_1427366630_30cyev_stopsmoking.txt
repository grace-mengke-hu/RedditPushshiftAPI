This is for you from someone where you want to be.

I need to open up about my past relationship and I think you all may be the most understanding.

Several years ago some of my friends came to visit me from out of town and wanted to see my city, Denver. We ran into one of their friends while walking around the city. He stuck around for the evening and my friends wanted him to come back to my parent's house where everyone was staying that night. I was nervous about bringing this guy into my home that I didn't know after years of my family cramming my head with the potential dangers I open myself up to, but for some reason I found him a bit mysterious, exciting and I sort of liked the danger aspect. Not to mention all my friends loved him, so he joined us at home.

The next day we all went to Six Flags, but I found myself hanging back on the stairs to the entrance to spend time with him. Within 18 hours he went from a scary new stranger to taking my breath away, making my knees weak. He made my heart race and my head dizzy more than any roller coaster there. I knew I needed him in my life

After my friends left, he stuck around. I was always finding excuses to sneak out and meet up with him. Usually at the parks around me, sometimes even in my backyard while my parents were sleeping. I didn't want them knowing about us (they were against me being with ANYONE until I was an adult and could make my own decisions). He was always there letting me know everything would be okay, that I should relax and take things slow and savor the moment.

We stuck together for years. My parents found out about us and they were very much against him. My old friends from school didn't approve of him so I found his friends becoming mine. I was fine with this for years, but I found myself slowly growing more cynical. He seemed to want me all to himself. Every break I got at work, I had to check in with him. My mornings, my evenings-- all dedicated to him. Hell, I couldn't get more than 30 minutes into homework or a MOVIE without stepping outside to let him know I hadn't forgotten about him. It was getting embarrassing around my friends, and I was seeing that my relationship with him was getting destructive. He was wearing me out and it was starting to show in my voice and on my face wherever I went.

After 8 years, It took all my strength to tell him I had to end this. I was too young and had too much ahead of me. He took it very poorly and made me feel like shit. I was in a constant internal struggle, I found myself yelling, screaming, crying, shaking, but I kept telling myself that every day that passed was a day farther away from him.

-


I tracked my days away from him. Mainly because I was proud of it. I was proud of my strength not needing him. Our mutual friends kept inviting me out, kept talking about him, so I found I needed to remove some of them from my life as well. They picked him over me, and I was cool with that.

I find myself now, 825 days later, stronger. I rarely think of him anymore. It used to only be when I was drinking did he come to mind, but even that had passed. Sometimes I find myself having dreams about him, but every time I do I turn over in bed and look at my new, wonderful partner who also gave up a similar girl over a year ago, and I know I will never go back to that destructive lifestyle again.

Everyone in this subreddit, I am proud of you for ending your destructive relationship.

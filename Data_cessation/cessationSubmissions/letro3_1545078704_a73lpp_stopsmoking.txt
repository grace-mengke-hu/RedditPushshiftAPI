12 days no smoking ! Don't wait until you're ill to do it

I went into the hospital 12 days ago due to chest pain and decided then and there that I'm done with smoking and that's exactly what I did. 
It sucked not knowing my last cigarette would be my last and I didn't even get to fully enjoy it but whatever. That was my last one and I'm not looking back :) 
After 5 years of smoking I'm finally cigarette free ! 
If anyone on here is having doubts on quitting smoking don't wait until you're in the hospital to decide that, do it now.

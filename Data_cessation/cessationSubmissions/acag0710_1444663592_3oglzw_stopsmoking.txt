what's a good substitute for people who want to stop smoking?

I've realized I have a lot of free time and I am looking for a good substitute for it. I don't want anything unhealthy and I've tried working out, it works for a couple of days but after a few days I am back at it. Please tell me what has worked and what hasn't

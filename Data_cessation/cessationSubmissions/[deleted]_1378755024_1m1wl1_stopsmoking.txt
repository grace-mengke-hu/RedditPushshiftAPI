Quitting while I still can

For the longest time I convinced myself that I was immune to cigarette addiction.

It started out with one, two, maybe three a week, then gradually went to a pack a week when I started purchasing them. Then to half a pack a day when I truly started living alone, and nearly a pack a day on drinking nights. I went on vacation for a week a couple of months back,  and the fact that I was able to take that time off without really thinking about smoking told myself that there was no fear to be had of addiction.

Then why did I go back to smoking 10-15 cigs a day right when I got back? My problem is mostly fearing the addiction more than anything else, while simply disregarding the health risks I'm incurring in the mean time. But anyway, it seems I might be misunderstanding what it means to be addicted. I don't really feel any burning desire to satisfy a "craving", but I do feel the desire to inhale and exhale smoke while going about certain parts of my day. I don't really get that so-called "wave of relief" when I take that first drag of a long-awaited cig.

Maybe someone can shed light. Maybe what I'm describing is exactly what it's like to be addicted. Maybe it's not. All I know is that I'm stopping now before I'm in to deep. There's just no compelling reason to continue.

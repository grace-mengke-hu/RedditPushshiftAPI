One year of quitting

So I quit smoking exactly one year ago! I did relapse a couple of times, hence the badge.
Quitting smoking has been an absolute turning point in my life. It acted as an enabler for turning my life around for the better. When I still smoked I was an extreme procrastinator and a slacker. I screwed up college and was a NEET, I stopped excercising, I smoked alot of weed. I was a lethargic mess.

One year later, I am healthier (physically AND mentally) than I have ever been. I excercise alot and I don't procrastinate nearly as much as I used to. I am actually using my talents for once, and I'm working on getting my dreamjob, and it seems to be working.
Without wanting to sound like a hippy, I feel like I've reached a point of higher consciousness thanks to getting rid of my nicotine addiction.

I do sometimes miss smoking, to be honest. I miss socializing outside over beer and cigarettes, I miss that nicotine buzz. It's strange how we romanticize smoking. I started playing chess recently, and couldn't help but think 'this would be so much more fun while chainsmoking!'
I had intense cravings over the weekend (I was travelling, travelling is a big trigger for me), which is what prompted me to come back here and remind myself why quitting is so important.
I relapsed a couple of times, but every relapse has given me new insights and has brought me a step closer to absolute freedom from nicotine.

Good luck to all you quitters out there, and thanks for being here the past year. I could have never done this without this subreddit.

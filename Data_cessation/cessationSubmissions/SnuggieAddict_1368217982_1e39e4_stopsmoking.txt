Into Day 5 - Why am I losing my enthusiasm?

I've been pretty hyped about quitting. The first 3 day was pretty bad mentally and gave me horrid headaches, stomach pains and whatnot. Day 4 was pretty great. But Here I am, at the day 5. Instead of huge craving like I had on day 1, I'm having constant nagging feeling like something is missing. Well - it is missing, but It's not like I'm going to smoke.
I admit. I miss having a cigarette in my hand. But I don't miss smoking. I smell nice. My Home Office Smells nice. Food gets tastier and I can take nice big breathes of warm air.

as I said - I'm not going back to smoking. I'm planning a pregnancy within the next few months and I want to be clean. but why am I so "meh" about the whole process all of a sudden?

3 weeks since I stopped smoking; today I forgot I wanted a pack. Good sign!

I quit smoking about three weeks ago. I actually haven't thought about it much since the first few days. Today, though, I decided I was going to thrash my body with alcohol and junk food and other things. I decided, after a long internal struggle, to get cigs too. 

When I was checking out, though, I forgot I wanted them. I realized my "mistake" once in my car. Then I was free, free to get in my car and escape! 

It's the rule of three's right? Three days, three weeks, three months; those are the times when the craving strikes? 

Haha fuck you cigarettes.

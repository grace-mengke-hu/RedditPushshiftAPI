Dry/burning eyes

I have quit smoking for 1,5 months now after trying 5 times. 1-2 weeks ago I have had trouble with my eyes being dry and burning, especially while working with a computer, watchting TV etc. I am already using eye drops but they don't help much. I can't find anything about this symptom, did some of you experience this aswell?

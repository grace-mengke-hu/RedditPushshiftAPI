The first time I quit was easy. Now it seems like a nightmear..

I am scared to quit smoking. I'm scared to even try and quit again. 

I quit for a month a while ago and since then have gone 3-7 days without. But now the idea of quitting is seriously scary I'm so afraid I won't be able to do it and will be miserable without. 

I am aware it won't kill me without but why is a big part of me now telling me I'm better with cigarettes. 

Just some advice would be nice

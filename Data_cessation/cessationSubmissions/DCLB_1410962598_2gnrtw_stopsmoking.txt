Need help finding a device!

Hello everyone,

I have recently quit smoking and I have joined a support group. Most people in this group have not yet stopped smoking, but are all planning to do so. This question is for one of my fellow quitters in this group: there is a woman in my group, she has smoked for decades and wishes to quit. However, she does not dare to use any sort of medication or nicotine products. Instead, she wants to use a certain device: for one week, every time you smoke a cigarette, you click on this device (the same way a stewardess does when she counts the heads in a plane). The next week, this device sends you a signal to smoke every now and then, in an attempt to break your routine. This woman has done her best to find this device (which a friend of hers used), but she can't seem to find it. I valiantly offered to search for it as well, but I cannot find it either. Does someone here know the name of this mystery device?

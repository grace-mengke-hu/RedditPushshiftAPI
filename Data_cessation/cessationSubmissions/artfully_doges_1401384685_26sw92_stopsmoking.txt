Just wanted to share what worked for me.

I had tried to quit and failed more times than I can count.  Then, one day, I decided to simply educate my self.  Not really planning to quit, but just to prepare for that one day when I was ready.  I googled "Nicotine addiction" and stumbled on to this site.

The information I found has changed my life.  I blew a whole day at work reading the articles and learning exactly what I was up against and how to find freedom from nicotine.  At the end of the day, I spontaneously took 1/2 pack of cigarettes, soaked them in water and threw them in the trash.  That was almost 3 years ago and I have not had one (or any other form of nicotine) since.  

The articles and videos helped me learn to beat the cravings and get past those impossible first three days.  Then I got through those difficult two weeks and eventually realized that not smoking was my new normal.

Being a non-smoker is great!  I feel better, have more energy and more money.  I will be forever grateful to the wonderful people who selflessly educate at whyquit.com.  I hope you can find freedom too.

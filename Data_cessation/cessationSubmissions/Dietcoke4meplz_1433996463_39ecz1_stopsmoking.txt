First off I want to say I am so proud of everyone on this sub. One hour, one day, one year. I know how hard it is to quit. I was/am a smoker. Of 10 years, and I was smoking a pack a day. Wow. That is gross. You all know. And although it has been a long time since an actual cigarette has touch my lips I am using an e cig. (Please disregard all negative comments on that. I don't have time for them. I'm too busy working each day on becoming 100% smoke free) but my biggest motivator is hearing people tell me that I CAN'T do it. I want to prove them all wrong. So if anyone is just like me. Keep it up. You can't do this.

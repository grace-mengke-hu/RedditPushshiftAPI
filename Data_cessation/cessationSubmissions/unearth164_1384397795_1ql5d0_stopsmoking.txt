Feel like shit after quitting?

Hey /r/stopsmoking. I'm 19 and was a smoker for about 3-4 years. 2-5 cigarettes a day (which I've been told is "nothing" by smokers and nonsmokers alike) with short breaks (attempted quits) in between. Now, I'm certain I'm never going to touch another just because of how bad they are. I'm on day 9 and I've noticed a few symptoms that had me concerned but most of them are shrugged off as typical withdrawal symptoms. 

Symptoms include: 

Achy chest - have been told it's from the increased oxygen that my body isn't yet used to

Sweaty palms

Paranoia and anxiety up the wazoo, mostly fear of smoking-related illness, though I'm mostly sure it's all in my head.

A periodic thump around my left chest area. Don't know if it's my heartbeat or my chest muscles acting up (I also recently started working out so that could be a contributor). My father, a smoker of 21 years, told me that it's not a heart or breathing condition because I would feel it in my whole chest (truth?).  This is what's concerning me the most.

Dizzy spells and dry heaves (have not experienced that since day 6, thankfully. Vomited once.)

Constipation (understandable since cigarettes are laxatives)

Just a little freaked out and wanting to know I'm not alone. No history of any medical issues before smoking.

Obligatory 365 day post

Everyone else does it, so here's mine - my obligatory 365 day post.  I was 31 years old, had been smoking since I was about 15.  I got up to almost 2 packs a day when I finally quit.  I did gain about 30 lbs once I quit, but it was so worth the extra weight.  I do a lot of hiking, finished a C25K program, and have run in several sanctioned short distance races.  I'm a big guy, so this is quite an accomplishment. I read about 30 pages of Carr's book and just decided to quit.  Never finished the book, and have not smoked since.  You can feel free to ask me any questions you'd like, I'd be happy to answer them.  Some of my thoughts on quitting:

There is never a "perfect" time to quit smoking.  It does help if you get your mind right, but you just have to make the leap.

You will likely gain weight, but you will be so much healthier it won't matter.

You won't be embarrassed by how your clothes/breath smell anymore, and you've just doubled your potential dating pool.

Don't quit for anyone else but yourself.  That's all the motivation you need.
Don't announce your intention to quit to everyone, just do it.  Eventually they'll notice that you have quit and it's a lot less pressure/stress to succeed.  

After you quit, you will think about smoking and still get cravings from time to time, but you are so much better equipped to deal with them that they won't matter.  

Good luck and enjoy your new life!

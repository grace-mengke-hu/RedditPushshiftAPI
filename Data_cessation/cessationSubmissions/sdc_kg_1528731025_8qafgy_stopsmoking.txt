I dreamed I lit up last night.

Woke up all freaked out. I was at work and I lit a cigarette. The co-worker who always busts my ass about caving was there, with his usual look of disappoint and everything! Shook me. Woke up in a near-panic over it. I'm still weirded out a little, but there's no way in hell I'm gonna bomb over it! Stay strong, and I will too!

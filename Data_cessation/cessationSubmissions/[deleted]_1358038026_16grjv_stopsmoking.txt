I thought I was going to die.

I am 27 years old and have been smoking for ten years. Before I quit today I was up to a pack and a half a day. 

I have been sick since the day after Christmas and starting two days ago I started having the worst coughing fits of my life. Coughing so hard that I get dizzy and and so frequently that sleep was completely impossible, even while severely doped up. Yesterday I had a coughing fit that I couldn't stop. I honestly thought I was going to die until my mom finally figured out to let me use her nebulizer. 

I am only 27 years old. I don't want to die. Fuck this shit, I will not feed the little monster any more. I have read the book, and it is a life saver. Literally.

I can do this.

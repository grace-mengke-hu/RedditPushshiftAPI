It's not the nicotine, it's the other stuff

Ashamed to say I got to a pack a day recently after 16 years of smoking (half my life!).  Just quit 11 days ago.  Does anyone else feel the nicotine isn't the issue?  I just want them when I drink with friends who smoke.  Or when I have coffee.  Or when I drive.  That seems more of a mental thing...not like my body craves nicotine during these things more.  

It's literally been half my life, and I almost feel I've lost an escape rout for some situations.

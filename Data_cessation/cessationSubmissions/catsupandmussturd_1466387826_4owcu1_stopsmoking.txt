I realized that my shitty part-time job was just serving to support my drinking and smoking habit

I do all of the budgeting for my girlfriend and myself on YNAB, and a couple days ago, I was feeling so confident about not drinking or smoking for nearly a week that I realized that we could JUST afford life if I quit one of my three jobs (the one I really don't like).  Girlfriend totally supported me, I put in my notice, and if I were to start smoking again, I would have to get another job just to afford it.

I am so grateful for this subreddit and to be able to afford having three extra days every week to focus on getting healthy!

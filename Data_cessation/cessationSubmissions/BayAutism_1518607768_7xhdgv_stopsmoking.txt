Cigarettes tasting bad?

I've been a light smoker (5 a day) for the past two years, since I was sixteen and I was down with the flu for the past week and had no access to ciggies, I went back to work again today and bought a pack on my way to the office, I lit one and the taste of it was horrible, mind you these are my regulars that I've been smoking for the past two years (Benson and Hedges gold filters). I had another one just to confirm that it wasn't the particular stick that tasted bad. After two puffs of the second one I chucked the pack into the garbage bin, $12 of my money gone but If I don't like it anymore what's the use?

I quit.

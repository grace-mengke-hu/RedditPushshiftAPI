Thought that one cigarette was ok

I'm having some tough time remembering why I'm quitting. It's just something that I went to to relieve my anxiety. I know it for a fact, something familiar to do while I calmed down. But I know smoking makes me even more anxious because of the effects it has on the body. 

My reasons for quitting:

Really Really bad for your body

Carcinogenic

Clothes smell

Expensive

Looks gross

Don't want to have cigarette breath

Causes wrinkles

Car is dirty- cigarette ashes EVERYWHERE

Constant dry cough/sore throat

Teeth are yellow

Fingers smell

Tastes bad

Once I get sick I can't smoke anyway and go through withdrawals again for what? 


Did I miss anything?

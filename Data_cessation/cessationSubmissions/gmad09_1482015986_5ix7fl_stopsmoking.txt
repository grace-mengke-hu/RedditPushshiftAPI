Day one... again

I have attempted to quit many times.. i went a good 6 days two weeks ago and then bought a packet :( i know stupid decision. Well ive finished that packet and i refuse to buy another one so this is day 1 again! Any encouragement is greatly appreciated.. i really need to do it this time.. i cant keep hiding my habit from my boyfriend. I feel like im living a lie!

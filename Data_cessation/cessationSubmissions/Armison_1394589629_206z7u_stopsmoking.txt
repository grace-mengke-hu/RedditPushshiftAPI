Glad I avoided the Obama-care smoking surcharge.

I lost my medical insurance plan because of Obama-care and I signed up for a new policy today. (I was *not* happy because my new plan costs $150 more a month than the one I had.) Out of curiosity I asked my agent how much it would have cost if I had still been smoking. She said a smoker would pay $149 more a month. Thank heaven I didn't have to take that hit too.

First day starts in the morning. Need some advice.

I have smoked for 17 years and am ready to quit.  I have the support of my fiance, and I have the Nicoderm patches.  I plan on popping a patch on first thing tomorrow when I wake up instead of smoking, but I don't want to have a chance to smoke when I wake up.  I am wondering if it would be a good idea to just put one on tonight before I go to bed to make it easier.  Also, what are some tips to deal with the oral fixation part?

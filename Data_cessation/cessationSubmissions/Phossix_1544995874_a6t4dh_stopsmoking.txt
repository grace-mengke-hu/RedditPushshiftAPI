Smoking killed my Grandmother

This is going to be my last post on this.  I've wrote two posts about my grandmother being diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, which as a heavy smoker was not necessarily surprising, but it still hurt. This is what convinced me to quit smoking. 

Unfortunately, she passed away on Wednesday morning. Our family is crushed.  I don't think it's registered that she's gone. My grandfather looks lost. 

People often joke about how I don't really "show emotion". But I broke down when I got to the hospice and saw her. All I could think was how I hate cigarettes. I hate them so much and never want to even touch one again.

The funeral is on Tuesday. Which also just happens to be my birthday. Man, fuck cancer and fuck cigarettes. 

At this stage, I want to focus on the positives on quitting as opposed to the negatives. But I'm sure we all know that smoking doesn't tend to lead to happy endings. 

I think I can stop posting here now but I'll stick around and provide help to those who need it. Y'all deserve to be happy and healthy.

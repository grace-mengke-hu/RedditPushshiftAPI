Rough day today

Really feeling worn out and tired from the fight today. Felt good even got out of bed this morning, but started really feeling run down around lunch time. Decided to jump on my motorcycle and go for a ride to clear my head. It did feel good to be out and breathing in the cool air. There was just one problem, every damn car I got behind had someone smoking in it. 

Every. Damn. One!

Why is it that once you quit smoking you smell a lit cigarette from a mile away? I didn't shy away from them though. I sat back there on my bike and breathed deep. I didn't let my brain lie to me and tell me that they smelled good, I smelled them for what they truly were. I realized that they stink, and I don't want to smell like that anymore. 

I refuse to smoke. I refuse to give in. I refuse to smell like an ashtray anymore. I will beat this. I refuse to smoke with you today.

Relapse after 6 months, and question for long-term smokers

Well, stress, school and stupidity, I started smoking again 2 weeks ago. Obviously I don't want to get anywhere close to how addicted I was in the past. I'm gonna finish up this black and mild and then commit to quitting again. 

Out of curiosity though, for you veteran smokers out there, how has your addiction changed from when you were say early 20s? For example, in the two years I've smoked the habit became less about enjoying the feeling and more about sustenance. Do the roots of addiction grow ever deeper as you continue smoking? If I have trouble quitting now, is it even worse 10 years down the line?

Day 22

Hi all,

I'm on day 22 of no smoking. I'm 36 and have smoked for 22 years. 
I rolled my own 20 odd times a day.

I can't believe i've made it this far. I guess i was ready.

Feeling like a mess but having great feelings of energy and clarity in between and am holding onto those feelings for dear life.

I'm using an inhalator on its own. Without it i wouldn't have been able to get this far and am noticing on some days i don't use it as much as when i first started.

This is hard but so worth it.

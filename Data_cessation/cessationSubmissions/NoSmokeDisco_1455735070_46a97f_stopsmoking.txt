Ok, list your physical reactions to not smoking and during which lengths

47.8 days in and I fully intend to stay smoke and nicotine free, however I'm having some frustratingly physical reactions on a daily basis and they only appear to be getting worse.

For context, I quit cold turkey with no NRT, I'd been smoking near on 20 a day for 20 years, starting at 13.

I've had regular checkups all my
Life, never had any issues bar the immediate lung capacity and cardio, even maintained a moderately low resting heart rate, cholesterol, blood pressure.. But since quitting and starting a basic personal training routine I'm yet to start genuinely feeling better.

Now, I don't consider what I'm having as cravings anymore. I did when I was smoking and they'd instantly be relieved if i did smoke, but this feels like I've been misplacing the feeling for a very long time. I don't believe these are emotional or mental issues, I'm incredibly rational and controlled and I try my best to always breath, be mindful of myself and my surroundings and have prided myself on my ability to will power through this quit.

At this very moment I'm currently suffering from:

* Twitchy eyes
* Heavy brow
* Flu like symptoms (but no illness, no fever) ... Think the pressure of a headache without the pain, or a cold winters day where you scrunch your nose and it feels like it slowly goes back down (but all over my head and face)
* Skin crawls, in definable lines (like a trail of ants walking from my forehead across my head, down the back of my neck then out across my arms and down my legs)
* Light sensitivity
* Sound sensitivity
* Claustrophobic
* My eyes are quick to produce 'sleep'
* I'm feeling massively irritable
* I'm feeling massively tired
* I'm feeling massively stressed
* Short tempered
* Easily snap at people
* Limbs ache, heavy

This has been going on for 12 hours, and doesn't feel like it'll stop now in travelling home.

This is almost a daily occurrence.

It's probably worth noting that the evening of day 1 I went through Opiate-like withdrawal (shakes, fever, cold sweats, soreness of skin, ultra sensitivity, irritability due to those). I didn't sleep a wink, antihistamine helped. Anyways, I can tell things HAVE gotten better.

I'm monitoring triggers, I thought for a long time that it was just stress related or my reaction and filters for handling behaviour I considered bad are less in place, causing me to react quicker and more aggressively but this also occurs on days where there is nothing to stress about. Simple decisions like what to have for dinner trigger this, what to watch on tv etc...

There doesn't even have to be an excessive amount of things going on to trigger it.

So, firstly, thank you for the 'great achievement, 48 days is tough and you should be proud'... I've got a lot from reading people saying that and appreciate it on every post like it's been my own. My friends and family have been very supportive (though I'm sure some simply don't understand the level of discomfort this is causing). I know some of you genuinely do and that's a wonderful thing for me to remember.

Secondly, I'd be massively interested in what symptoms you suffer/ed and how you maybe learnt to cope with them, did you seek help or have any tests?

I'm seriously considering seeing my GP about what can be monitored/checked/tested/etc.

Thanks for reading, I should have been more active throughout my quit but please know I've been referring to this subreddit since day one.

Cheers.

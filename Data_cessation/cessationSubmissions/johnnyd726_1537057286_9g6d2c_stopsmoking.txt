Can’t seem to completely quit

I’m 17 now, have been smoking for around 2 years (yes I know it’s bad for me) and I haven’t been able to cut out completely.  I went from smoking around 15 cigarettes a day to 1, but I can’t seem to smoke none in a day.  I always crave that small amount of nicotine.  Any tips for finishing this off?  I want to quit more than anything.

Cravings suck, but you can do it, New Year's quitters. 

For all of you with resolutions to quit smoking, or whatever else you choose, remember this. You didn't need a new year to do this. You are strong and capable of your goal.

If you slip up and have a moment of weakness do NOT give up. Do NOT think your whole day/week/month is now ruined because you smoked that one cigarette.

Think of it this way, if you get a dent on your car door, do you send your car to the junk yard? No. Keep driving. Keep moving forward. Your goal isn't going to come over night. 

You can f***ing do this, you're amazing, and I love you.

When you try to quit, do you let yourself cheat?

I tried to quit once already, last summer. I'd let myself have one at the bar, one on a rough shift at work, as long as I didn't buy a pack, I considered it okay. When I was on the patch (I know, you shouldn't smoke on the patch) I kept it to one here and one there, and when I went off of it, that's when I started bumming three, four, five. Then I bought a pack.

So do you let yourself cheat? What rules do you set for yourself? And do you feel guilty for cheating, or do you see it as still being a step up from where you were? Is it better to have one here and one there then having one and feeling so terrible about it that you just want to give up and buy a pack?

I bought Step 1 again and I'm gonna try again really soon. Good luck to everyone else, and congrats to y'all who have been going strong a long while!

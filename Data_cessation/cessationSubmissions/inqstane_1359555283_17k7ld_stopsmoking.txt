Day 1: No excuses. No regrets. 

Today is my first day with this motto and I hope it helps get my past the harder parts of the first few days. I've spent the past few weeks "trying to quit" and basically every night I'd go to sleep telling myself that I had smoked my last cigarette only to break down first thing in the morning and buy a pack. It was never the "right time", which is bullshit and I knew it while I was saying it to myself. Every morning started with failure and the rest of the day's tone seemed to be set by it so I figured it's time for a new approach. I've decided to stop accepting the lame excuses I seem to be so happy to make up for myself. Hopefully this motto helps someone else.  NO EXCUSES = NO REGRETS. Good luck fellow quitters.

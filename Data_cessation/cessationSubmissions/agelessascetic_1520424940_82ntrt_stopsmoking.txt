19 days without a cigarette, but the nicotine cravings are still strong and I'm wondering about the eventual transition to nicotine-free living

Title pretty much says it all: I came down with a nasty cold a few weeks ago, and decided to use my sore throat as the impetus for taking a serious stab at quitting. It's been 19 days since my last cigarette, and I've won a few key battles including going out drinking and managing to NOT SMOKE AT ALL (which was pretty hard -- I did use smoke-free tobacco products, but I didn't have a cigarette).

Anyway, it's all well and good, but I've been using nicotine gum to control my cravings. I chew 4-5 pieces of 2mg gum per day, but I'm worried that I'm too reliant on them to help me control the cravings, and I'm also worried that while I'm not smoking, I'm still addicted to nicotine and I might actually be getting more addicted to it since I take it in more frequently (though probably in smaller amounts).

When I smoked, I had 2-3 cigarettes per day. Now I'm having 4-5 nicotine doses per day.

Anyone have insights to share? Quitting smoking is one thing, but quitting nicotine is another. Does anyone have tips on starting to address the underlying nicotine addiction once tobacco smoking has been conquered?

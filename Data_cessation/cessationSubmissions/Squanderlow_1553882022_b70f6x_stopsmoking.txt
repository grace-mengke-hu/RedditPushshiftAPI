Cold turkey or gradual decrease? What works best?

Hi guys, 25 year old half pack smoker for over 6 years now and I'm finally at a place where I am starting to feel the negative health consequences more than I used to. Last year I ran a half marathon in two hours and felt fine but a couple months ago I ran a 10k and was dying by the end.

What would you recommend for a quitting strategy? Cold turkey or gradually decreasing until I'm not smoking at all anymore? My triggers are pretty much whenever I leave the house, including gym, school, work, groceries, whatever.

Thanks!

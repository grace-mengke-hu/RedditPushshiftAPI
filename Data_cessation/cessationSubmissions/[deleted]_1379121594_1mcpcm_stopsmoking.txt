Couldn't be happier about this afternoon!

It's been a little over 100 days for me and its been amazing! I've had a few ups and downs but overall I'm so happy I quit.

This afternoon, I was walking into a local Barnes & Noble to buy The Book for my mom. Standing near the entrance of the store was a young woman smoking. As I walked past her, I accidentally walked through her cloud of smoke.

Not too long ago, I would smell smoke and that dumb part of my brain would inhale deeply and longingly even though I like being smoke-free. Lately it smells disgusting to me though. Woo!

Anyway, I walked through her cloud and made a mental gross face. Later that afternoon, my long-ish hair fell into my face and I got a whiff of her smoke. 

It smells so bad! It's been hours and I can still smell it mildly in my hair, and it's driving me nuts. I sprayed a bit of perfume and I can still smell it a little bit.

My husband couldn't smell it at all, so it's obviously not as bad as if I had actually smoked myself, but yuck!

I cannot believe I used to walk around smelling like an ashtray all the time.

 I'm so happy that I feel disgusted by the smell. It really solidified the fact that I will never smoke another cigarette. I will never smell like that again - at least not by my own hand! I guess I got used to smelling clean hair so I'd forgotten what it was like to smell smoke on myself. 

Anyway, just wanted to share this little milestone with you all!

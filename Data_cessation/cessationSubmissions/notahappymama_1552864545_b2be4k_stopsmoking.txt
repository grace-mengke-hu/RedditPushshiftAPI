70 days tomorrow!

Tomorrow marks 70 days, 10 weeks since I quit and damn I feel good. I’ve tried several times over the years, actually quit for a year and a half back in 2012, but stupidly started again. Not this time, no way.  I’ll admit I used the patch,I would never be able to go cold turkey, but with the help of an aid, it was easy and I was ready. I don’t miss it at all, now I need to get my husband to stop.

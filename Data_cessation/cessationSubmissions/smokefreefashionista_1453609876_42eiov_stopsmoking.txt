How long did it take for you to stop feeling glum, crabby, moody, etc. after quitting (no e-cigs, gum, or other nicotine sources)?

I quit cold turkey 8 days ago and have been hiding out a lot to spare my husband and 1st grade daughter from my crabbiness. Also, I've become nocturnal, up till 5AM, sleep till noon. Thank goodness it's a long snow-filled weekend and I don't have to return to work till Tuesday.
Would really appreciate hearing about others here-when did the moods subside? 
Thanks!

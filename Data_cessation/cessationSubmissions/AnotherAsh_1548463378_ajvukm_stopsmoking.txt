24 days in, and ow...

Quit #235923509834098 is going really well so far! But, ow! I've been coughing so hard the last few days that my back hurts..or my lung..or rib.. i dunno exactly what it is, but something hurts when I breathe/move. I may be coming down with a cold, but I'm also coughing up some crazy colored, can't believe that was in me phlegm that I can only assume is from years of coating my lungs in tar butter.

But, besides the weird breathing pain, this week's been great! The weather has been complete shit, full of rain and snow, and I've really enjoyed watching it through my window instead of standing in it, cowering under my umbrella, trying to finish my butt before my fingers freeze off. 

I really think (hope) quit #235923509834098 is my last quit, and good luck to all of you on yours :)

Day Six Update

It has been such a weird week. The second day I got incredibly sick, and I have no idea if it was just an illness, or what. Vomiting, dizziness, general misery. I am still having some stomach issues that have persisted all week. 

The cravings are getting worst in a lot of ways, and I have a pressure in my chest. My mood is just terrible and I am easily annoyed by everything. I am usually pretty laid back, so the change is noticeable. Plus, I am really fatigued and having trouble focusing.

However, I still feel good about this. I know it is just a couple weeks of struggle for a lifetime of health benefits. We're all going to make it!

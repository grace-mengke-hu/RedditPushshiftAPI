Stopped vaping four months ago, still intense cravings several times a day.

I smoked for about 6 years then I switched to vaping for another 4 years. About 4 months ago I stopped vaping completely and have been using 2mg nicotine gum since then. 

I go through about maybe 10 bits of gum per day to quell the cravings mostly.

I am still having very intense cravings for cigarettes several times a day, this is impacting my life a lot and my ability to concentrate on tasks. Whenever I see someone smoking I'm of half a mind to go up to them and ask for a cigarette. Cigarettes smell really good to me.

How long can I expect this to last, four months seems like a while to me. Is the gum prolonging the cravings? I'm not sure I would have been able to do this without gum.

Thanks

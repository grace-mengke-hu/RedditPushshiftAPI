Yesterday was a big day for me for two reasons

The main thing is that it's my 6 month anniversary of quitting cigarettes.  That's right!  I butt out my last one on 4/20 lol.  I started off wearing Nicoderm patches like usual, knowing I relapsed every other time I quit using NRTs.  But I gave it another go.  

The difference this time is that I found and joined /stopsmoking.  Reading your posts every day has been a major help.  You guys also led me to Allan Carr's Easy Way to Stop Smoking.  I downloaded the audiobook and it changed everything.  I knew I'd never smoke again, but I messed up and kept wearing the patches so I was essentially a non-smoking nicotine addict.  

Luckily that didn't last long.  It took exactly 3 months for me to give up NRTs and that leads me to the main point.

October 20th marked 6 months smoke-free as well as 3 months without any nicotine at all.  

I feel so much better.  While I do get the odd pang when I pass the NRT section of Walmart, it's never bad enough that I'd actually consider buying any.  And as for cigarettes, I don't miss or crave them at all.  They are dead to me.  

Thanks, /r/stopsmoking!  I know I couldn't have done it without y'all.  And to those of you just starting out, there is life after smoking.  You can do it, you just have to BOlieve!

6 months smoke free, here are my other two cents.

Hiii, I posted here 5-6 months ago about my experience, go check it out.

Anyways here's the 6 months update. Honestly I did not need to come back here and post anything anymore, I consider myself a non smoker, I have not had a single craving in like 3 months and I am feeling better than ever.

I mentioned in my previous post that I joined a gym, lol it's been 6 months and I'm still going at it. My body transformed completely, I gained 10 kg of weight and i look better than ever, I can do like 20 pull ups, people eye me up at the gym, I look like a bodybuilder.

Anyways back to the story, my only regret is all the time I wasted smoking instead of bodybuilding. Like I consider all of this time I'm pouring now into bodybuilding is an investment, I can see what my time was spent on (in the form of my body looking better and better) instead of smoking all day where i'm gaining nothing from the time and money being spent on smoking.

So anyways guys believe me, When all the cravings fade away you'll think what a crazy person you were pouring all of that precious time and money on smoking instead of other things where you'll see the results of your effort. Quitting smoking is the best and most important decision of my life.

Stay strong, and always refuse to be a slave to cigarettes, I'm the strongest mofo in the world! fuck cigarette.

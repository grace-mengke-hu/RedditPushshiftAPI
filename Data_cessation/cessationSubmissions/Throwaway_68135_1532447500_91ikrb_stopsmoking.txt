Increased sex drive? Like to the point I can't concentrate on ANYTHING else.

VERY anonomous account here with an embarrassing/strange question for all, but here goes.  Not a troll, mods please don't delete this post hopefully its not breaking any rules although it is a bit "sensitive".  43 yo male.  Quit smoking just over a month ago.  Holy SMOKES I can't keep it in my pants now.  I am so turned on all the time all I can think about is sex.  Finally got some last night and didn't even last 3 minutes.  WTF, its like I'm 18 years old again.  Anyone else experience this?  What is going on here???

5 years.

I smoked a pack a day from 18-31 tried to quit multiple times had a few months here and there, but by and large was a chronic smoker.

I've saved around 10k if I factor in my quitting attempts.

Something like 35000 cigs not smoked :O

I still see people smoking and feel like I'm missing out. I hate smokey bars. I don't let myself get super drunk because I still don't fully trust myself. 

Still, five years.

Protip. I bought a pack of menthol/teatree oil dipped toothpicks from wholefoods and I chewed those fuckers for two weeks straight, I went cold turkey, and by the end of the two weeks I almost felt like I was craving toothpicks. Then, I just never went back.

It wasn't easy and the first six months I definitely avoided smokey bars, most drinking, and had to make a few social sacrifices. 

Now, when I get a cold, or a sore throat, it lasts for days not weeks. Every time I get sick I definitely thank myself for quitting, it makes everything far more tolerable.

I listened to the easy way to stop smoking by Allen Carr, and his quote on how you can sleep 7 hours without a cig but try going 7 hours during the day without one, really helped me realise just how much of it is mental.

I wish you all strength and courage, and would love for everyone share the same milestones. Have a great day reddit.

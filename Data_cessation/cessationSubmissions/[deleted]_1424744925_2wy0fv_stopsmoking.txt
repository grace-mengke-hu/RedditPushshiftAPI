Yet Another Attempt!

Every time I decide to quit, I realize how happy it makes me to have control of my life again. 

So, here's a list of what I'm looking forward to now that I'm not going to buy cigarettes anymore:::

1) going up the three flights of stairs in my building without feeling *fucking exhausted*

2) having better skin, nails, hair, breath, teeth

3) not feeling dehydrated all of the time

4) not having to take time out of my day to think about and step away from my routine in order to smoke

5) not having to search for a goddamned lighter

6) HAVING $$$

7) knowing that no one (namely family) can hold shit over my head

8) not having that tight feeling in my chest *all the time*

9) not having to worry about losing my beautiful voice (singing is cathartic!)

10) FOODS WILL TASTE DELICIOUS. ALL THE FOODS!

11) facing my demons - addressing the reasons I smoked 

12) better circulation = better orgasms

13) warmer feet & hands!

14) becoming more creative in finding ways to reward myself after small tasks are completed

15) not having to worry about cancer

16) not having to worry about aging prematurely (wrinkles! gah!)

17) feeling more calm 

18) experiencing a renewed sense of self-pride

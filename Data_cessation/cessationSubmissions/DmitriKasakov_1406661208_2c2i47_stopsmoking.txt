Framing is the most important part.

I wanted to quit smoking because I was an addict to it. Those little fuckers controlled me, whenever I had a big craving I would start smoking again. Didn't mattered how long I had been smoke free 1 day or 1 month. I always gave up, but then I reframed it.

I am no longer quitting smoking, now I am not smoking. 

Its way different now because i have repeated myself enough that i dont enjoy smoking, that is a nasty thing, and it tastes like shit that i genuinely believe it. I dont have cravings, I dont think about smoking.

**Quit trying and do it.** Trying means that there is a chance of failure, being certain of doing something doesnt.



Just my 2 cents.

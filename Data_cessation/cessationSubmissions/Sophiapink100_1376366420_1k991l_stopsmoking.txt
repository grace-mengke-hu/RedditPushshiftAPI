wishing i never quit

Is it normal to wake up everyday thinking .. Why did I quit? I feel like I haven't benefited from it at all apart from the fact I don't smell of smoke anymore! Yes ok there is the financial side .. I could do loads with the money I spend on fags but I just haven't been the same since I quit. I'm miserable, exhausted and have a constant migraine!

Day 5, I've hit the "Everything Sucks" point.

This is how far I made it last time before I caved. I am frustrated today because of money (seconds away from filling for bankruptcy). Last night was my first sleep disturbance (I drifted in and out of sleep for 3 hours before finally konking out), I'm horny AF with no outlet, and my work day consists of a menial task that will consume 9 hours of my life. This is the point I got to last time where I went "this just SUCKS, I'd rather die early than live every day hating everything"

Stories of when Everything Stopped Sucking would be appreciated today.

Day 1 - Smoking a joint always ruined it for me

Hey guys,

first, thank you all! You are a great help!

I smoked cigarettes daily for 13 years now. Since the age of 15, I smoked pot daily for a few years. Since then, I stop smoking weed every once in a while for a few weeks. 

In the last 15 months, I quit smoking 3 times. I fell back every time because I smoked a joint. Then it always takes some time of heavy tobacco smoking before I find the motivation to quit again. So, I'm nearing the end of day 1 now, I need to write my masters thesis, and I'm not sure if I want to quit smoking weed forever (like I want with cigarettes). Do some of you smoke pot with friends occasionally? Do you just go through the cravings on the next day? I assume they will stop faster the longer you are off daily smoking? Vaping or eating is not really an option for me. It's not the same and I don't like it nearly as much.

Thank you all!

Quit smoking cigarettes and got hives

I was smoking about a pack every 3 days. Exactly one week ago I quit smoking cigarettes and bought a Juul (vape) I was fine for the first 4 days, but the last few days I’ve had hives. I stopped smoking the vape and the hives slowly went away. Anyone experience hives when quitting/changing nicotine levels? I know I’m not allergic to the vape ( propylene glycol) because I didn’t get a reaction for a few days, if I was allergic it would have showed up faster.

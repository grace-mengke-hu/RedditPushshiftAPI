ONE MONTH!!! &lt;3

I'm very happy to be able to say that I made it this far, and I look forward to continuing on this journey. Smoking is never worth it, smoking can never solve any real problems, smoking can only create more problems and make simple problems outside of smoking more difficult to handle. I just want to say thank you to everyone on this subreddit for being here because this has been a great support system for me, and I love reading reports from other people about their journeys. If you haven't quit smoking yet, I GREATLY encourage you to do so, and if you have quit smoking, KEEP UP THE AMAZING WORK! STAY STRONG PEOPLE! We can do this, and we can live much better lives without poisonous cigarettes taking away from us. I hope you all have a blessed day/night, and I wish you all the best on your journey.

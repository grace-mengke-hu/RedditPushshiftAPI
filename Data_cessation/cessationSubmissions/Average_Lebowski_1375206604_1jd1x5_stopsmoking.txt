1 Week Down. Feel Great!

Stopped last Monday night after reading Allen Carr's Easy Way to Quit Smoking. I am also been taking Zyban (bupropion) for ~2 weeks.  Cravings have been light and predictable.  I have smoked a pack a day for 16 years.  I was able to quit for a 3 year stretch in the past.  Took multiple tries to get this one to start to stick.  Very optimistic and wary of falling into complacency.  "Not one puff" 

I can tell you I was not a hermit during the last week.  I went out to bars and the lake with smoking friends.  I think it is important to stay in your normal routine.

**TL;DR=1Week!**

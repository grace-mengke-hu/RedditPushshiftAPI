How do you deal with anxiety without smokes?

So I've seen a good amount of comments around here about how lots of us used to smoke to deal with everyday life anxiety. I had to reset my badge last week, right around my 30 days mark because I found myself in a situation where I was extremely tired, disappointed at myself and generally upset. For some reason, this took me by surprise. I have been able to deal with most of my other triggers, but feeling really down and depressed I guess didn't happen throughout my first 30 days, and when it did, I didn't know how to deal with it and stupidly resorted to the known routine of buying a pack. 
Obviously, the smokes didn't help and I am even more resolved now to stay quit as I feel so much better being a non-smoker. 
However, I'd be interested to know what others have been doing in order to deal with their anxiety. That uneasiness when thinking of the next step, the next project, the painful inner turmoil of important decisions, that fear of failure or rejection? Thank you for any tips/advice.

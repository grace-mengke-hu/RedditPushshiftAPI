Quit cigarettes cold turkey in March 2012; over the last few weeks I've REALLY wanted to smoke. Today, it's almost all I can think about. Considering buying a pack just for one cigarette... WTF?

Does anyone know if this is a thing? Or is it just my elevated stress levels currently? I'm in life-limbo right now, waiting to hear what graduate school I'm going to in January, so that may be it. But seriously, I want to go buy a pack of cigarettes and just chill with one outside. Help?

EDIT: *Almost* bought a pack at the liquor store with some beer... I walked in and intend to buy it; I even asked the cashier, but he didn't hear me the first time and, when I clarified what I wanted, I hesitated... I didn't buy, but I still crave... It's so strange to me. The guy even offered to sell me the pack, let me smoke one, and take the pack back and hold it for me lest I need another later... I didn't buy it though. I got my beer, pizza, and now I'm watching Star Wars.... This is gonna seem pathetic, but I don't care. Thanks for the continued encouragement.

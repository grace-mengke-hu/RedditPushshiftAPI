How I quit!

I remember when I decided it was over with me and cigarettes. I told myself "Nothing is more important right now than not having a cigarette" I told myself that hundreds of times a day. Eventually it stuck! No excuse could combat that frame of mind.

When I got a few days in I kept reminding myself "I quit that" instantly when I had a thought pop up. The key was to stop the thought earlier and I could go about the rest of my day without suffering as much. Knowing that it wasn't an option anymore helped.

Eventually a week or two passed, and I realized, "I never have to smoke again if I do this just once a day, every day." I kept going. 

I craved the most at night when I couldn't sleep, but I was always motivated because when I wake up I'd have another smoke free day under my belt. 

Months later, it has gotten much easier. I'm reaping the benefits of not smoking. My girlfriend loves it, I don't smell anymore, my lungs are working like champs, I am free! Stay strong everyone, it gets easier I promise!

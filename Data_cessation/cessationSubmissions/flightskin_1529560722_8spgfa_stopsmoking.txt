Closet smoker who honestly loves smoking. I fear my love for smoking is going to take over my life

So I'll be honest, there are some days where the only enjoyable thing I do is sleep and smoke cigarettes, because I hate my current life so much. I won't even enjoy eating . But I am really good at hiding it and no one has a clue (after years of being an actor and being gay, etc. ) The thing is I suspect if it goes any further it'll become obvious. Help

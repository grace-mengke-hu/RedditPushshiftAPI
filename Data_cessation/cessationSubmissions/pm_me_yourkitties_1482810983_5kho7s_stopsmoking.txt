I think I did it!

A little over two months I think? It's gotten to the point where I only get a craving when I'm quite drunk or when I'm around my grandmother, who smokes in the house. Now the cravings aren't mind consuming but like swatting away a fly. 
It took about seven attempts, two reads of Allen Carr and one audio listen but I DID IT! And you can too. Please just keep trying! 

I won't lie, my life isn't totally different but just knowing that I beat it and that I beat it for so long makes me happy. It makes me a lot happier than when I was beating myself up for giving in again or hungover with a scratchy throat. You can do it! Thanks for all the support from you guys while I was lurking this sub. This place and the recommendations for Allen Carr are really what did it for me and for that I am so grateful.

Would anyone be willing to fill out this questionnaire about smoking for my high school health class?

I want to help educate the teenagers in my class about the dangers of smoking. Your [input](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1jRWiDH2Xub2JDeb3SH4aUvDNUBodwwJHBJI5Vh4WjJE/viewform) would be greatly appreciated! 

You don't need to submit a name. 

Edit: Thanks to all who submitted, you are so greatly appreciated!
Edit: I have closed the survey at about 220 completions. Thanks Reddit for the overwhelming support!

Question: are you still avoiding friends that smoke?

I went out with some friends a couple weeks ago that all still smoked, i was the only one that didnt, so while we were at the bar (and i was sippin on pellegrino instead of alcohol) they kept going outside every 20 minutes and i was left on my own in a packed bar with a dead cellphone. felt pretty lame, and i ended up going home early because hanging out with people who are drunk while you're the only sober one gets old quickly. so i've been avoiding my friends and doing my own thing instead, just until i feel comfortable being out with everyone again. 
anyone else feel the same way? do you avoid people because of this? some friendships have slowed down since quitting, but in my mind and in the short term, its worth it. thoughts?

16 days Smoke Freeeee and passed a HUGE trigger test :)

My SO and I are quitting together which is a godsend since I am such a competitive person!

This weekend was the first time being around and involved with alcohol and drugs and not having a smoke.  I ALWAYS smoke when I drink and was so worried I would never be able to drink again without craving.  It felt great :)  

Happy to be joining this healthy community!!

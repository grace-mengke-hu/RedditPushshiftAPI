quit smoking start running

quit smoking 10 days ago and today i run 3.5km(2.2 miles) i know this is nothing compared to running a half marathon or something like that but for me its a good start and felt good!! althout gasping for air in the end i can see some improvements, btw i switched to e-cigs so im not off nicotine, anyone who quit smoking start running here? did you notice a big diference after lets say 3 months off cigs ?

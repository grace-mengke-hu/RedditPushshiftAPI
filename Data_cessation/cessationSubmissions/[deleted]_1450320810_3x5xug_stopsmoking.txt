I don't think you guys can quit smoking

After several attempts of trying to quit, my girlfriend says to me "I don't think you are capable of not smoking."  And it really pissed me off! Ain't no motherfucker on this planet is going to tell me I can't do something! 

 When a craving hits, the rage sets in and I chew some gum, go for a walk, do some pull ups or something to get my mind right.

Haven't smoked in over 2 weeks guys. I don't think you can quit either.

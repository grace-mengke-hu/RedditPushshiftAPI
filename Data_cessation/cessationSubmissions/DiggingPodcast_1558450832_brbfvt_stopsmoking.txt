What worked for you?

I know there’s plenty of sources, but since this community is here for one sole purpose, as someone trying to quit, what was your smoking status and how did you break free?

Me, I smoke 5-10 cigs on any given day, keep saying I’m gonna quit tomorrow, which turns to next week and so on and so on. As someone who’s trying to quit, what did you do to finally quit?

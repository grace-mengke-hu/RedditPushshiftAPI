Day 5. Kicking three addictions. Smoking is the toughest for me. It's working.

Smoking, drinking, porn. Smoking is my toughest addiction. It's not that I am quitting them all for the first time. I have long stretches of success with quitting each one. When I lose a handle on one, the others seem to fall closely behind. It's a cluster thing. So I decided five days ago to get back on the wagon with all three. Bad moments here and there, but I'm okay. Thanks for the support of this sub, and two others, /r/stopdrinking/ and /r/pornfree/.

Is this Subreddit vape quitting friendly? Gonna put it down today, need support.

I have been off tobacco for 4-5 years. But I’m sick of vaping and spending money on addiction. And now I’m running so I want nothing going in my lungs. Is this subreddit also for people quitting vaping? I’ve spent the last few weeks weening down from 50mg to 6-3mg ish. I have crippling anxiety so I’m super scared of how I’ll react but I want to throw it all away after work today. I think I’m ready. I have to be miserable now to be happy later.

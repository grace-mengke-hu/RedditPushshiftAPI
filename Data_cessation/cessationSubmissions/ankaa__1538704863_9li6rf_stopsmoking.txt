Every time I smoke, my body begs me to quit

Hey everyone. First time posting here.

I'm a 28 y/o female who has smoked since 15 or so. I've considered quitting multiple times, but only really attempted once, couple years ago, through the use of patches. I was doing pretty well, but some stuff happened IRL and I ended up getting right back at it - as it happens to a LOT of people, I'd wager.

Nowadays I've been smoking a pack a day... But every single time I light one, all that's in my head while it's burning is "I hate this. I hate this taste. I hate this smell. That's it, I'm done. I don't want this being a part of my life anymore," but... Well, as you can probably guess, 40-60 minutes go by and there I am lighting up another one and repeating the cycle...

I'm sorry about the wall of text, I'm just really frustrated at myself because of this and I really needed to just let it out. I'll keep trying - considering patches -, but... Honestly losing faith I could ever do it :/

And while I'm at it... Would anyone be willing to share any tips that might seem to fit my situation? 

Thanks a lot!

Wish me luck!

I'm 23 and have been smoking for 8 years now. As more time goes on, the more cigarettes I smoke a day. They're gross, they smell like shit, they're horrible. I'm going to wake up tomorrow with no cigarettes. I plan on using a nicotine patch (step 2, 14mg patch). I'm also going to use CBD to help with the anxiety and other side effects. 

I'm really nervous but I choose life over cigarettes. I need to do this!!!

Wish me luck guys :)

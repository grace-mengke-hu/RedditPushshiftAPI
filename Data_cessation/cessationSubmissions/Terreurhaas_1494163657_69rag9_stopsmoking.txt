Day zero, looking forward to being done for good!

As some of you may know, I was dumped last month and started smoking again. Today I finally decided, and I stand by it, to quit again. It's been roughly seven years since I first started, and since seven is my lucky number I decided to quit on the seventh.

I had my last smoke at around 1400 hours local time, and I didn't even finish it. I took a few drags, looked at it, and put it out.

Wish me luck guys! The next week is going to be a lot of self-improvement!

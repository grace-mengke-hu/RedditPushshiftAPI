Day 139: Dreamed that I turned down a cigarette instead of smoking it.

I had a dream last night, where I was offered a cigarette.  I politely declined the offer and said I didn't smoke anymore.  When I woke up I didn't' think much of it until later.  I have had very vivid smoking dreams in the last 139 day and I have always felt extremely guilty afterwards.  I've worked too hard to get where I am and I don't want to start all over again.

I feel like this is a major milestone for me, a very exciting milestone.

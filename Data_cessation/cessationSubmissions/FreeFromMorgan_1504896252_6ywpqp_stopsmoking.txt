A whole year with no nicotine! $3000 saved, 28 full days not spent outside sitting in a cloud of nasty smoke, not smelling up a room when I walk in.

It's not even a thought anymore, I feel better, I am happier, I can breathe, I don't smell like ass hole, I don't waste time just smoking. It is the best decision I have ever made. 

I just told myself over and over "if I give in now, one day I will look back on this day from a hospital bed and wish I had quit" 

I told myself " I am no longer a smoker, non smoker get through this and worse without a cigarette and so can I" 

It took a million times but this time I just decided I'm done with it, and I am so happy I did.

Hyssop and Menthols

I smoked menthols for 45 years. Recently got Hyssop essential oil in, ordered it because I was curious and to my delight instantly fell in love with it.  It helps with your breathing, respiratory ailments, mood and even firms skin?  It reminds me a bit of Vicks Vaporub.  I find the menthol of it is a nice substitute for cigarettes. I pick up the bottle and breathe the scent in. Have even rubbed a little bit right inside my nostrils. It says you can put it on your chest, etc.  I wanted to share in case this could help someone else.

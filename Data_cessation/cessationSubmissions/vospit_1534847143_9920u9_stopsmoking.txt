People that smoked because they were nervous during social situations?

I'm trying to stop smoking again.. I'm okay when I'm busy, when I'm working, not a problem.  
But when there's a social situation I feel like instantly grabbing a cigarette.   
It might be because I'm nervous when I'm conversing with people (who I know and don't know). 

Anyone that can relate to this?

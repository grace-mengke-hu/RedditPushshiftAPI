The Cravings... AAAHHHHH!!!

Sup, I posted here about a week ago on how I bought a packet. With support from you guys, I threw out the packet. I've been craving ever since. Its still in the trash and the rubbish-collector doesn't come til tomorrow. The last few days have been intense. My mood is so bad. I went to the bin and fished out the packet. I couldn't find my lighter so I skated down to the servo, sat down and had a coffee. Then grabbed a lighter, lit up a herbal smoke (passionflower & Damiana) I still am having such painful cravings. I need just that tiny bit of nicotine/relaxation from a cigarette. I'm thinking about just mixing a small amount of.tobacco with herbs in a rollie. Ugh... Do I rescue a cig or two before the rubbish-guy comes?! I'm going mental!!

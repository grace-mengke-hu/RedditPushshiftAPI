Day 7 and incredibly depressed.

Hey all, I'm new to the subreddit and figured I'd start it off with a post. 

I was a smoker for two years up until last week. Now my nicotine habits go much deeper than that, I started dipping at the age of 16 and I'm now 20 trying to kick nicotine all together.

So far I've made good progress, I went cold turkey last week and while Ive had cravings and almost gave in twice I've remained strong in my effort to quit. I haven't felt overly stressed or frustrated until day 7. Now a bit of a background, I struggle with anxiety and depression so I account for some of my feelings due to that. Now my question is, should I be experiencing an increased feeling of anxiety or depression a week into quitting? I heard its bad the first three days and it gets better but for me it seems opposite. Anyways, that's just my rant and wall of text, any help or tips would be appreciated.

Advice

Hey everyone! First time poster on Reddit :) so I've been a smoker for 6 years. Until now, I've never had the motivation to quit. Lately, over the course of a few months, I've made some lifestyle changes that have really benefited my life. And now it's time to quit smoking. 

I've committed to stop smoking on Monday because my work schedule until that time is very hectic and I don't want to set myself up for failure on those first few tough days. 

What I would like is some advice to prepare my environment in the mean time? Things such as getting the smell of smoke out (or reduce) in my car? 

Also, how long is the detoxing supposed to last? What should I expect after I quit smoking? First time trying to quit, so any advice is helpful. 

Thank you!!

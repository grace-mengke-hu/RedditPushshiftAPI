Whoa.. This is awesome!

I haven't smoked for one week and I am really happy. But my day got even better: my roommate told me that she stopped smoking too! She was not a real smoker but on the right way to become one (+/- 4 cigarettes a day). But I guess when she saw me in the weekend, feeling horrible from the withdrawal, being angry and impatient for no reason, she must have been just too shocked and stopped! :) I hope I can inspire more of my smoking friends.

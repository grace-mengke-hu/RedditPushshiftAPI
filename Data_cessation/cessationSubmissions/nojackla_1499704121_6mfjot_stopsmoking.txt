700 Days...

I was browsing through Reddit and paused on a post from this sub and realized that I hadn't been here in a while. I looked over and "Wow. 700 days!"

I really don't think about cigarettes very much at all anymore. When I do, it's almost always with revulsion. There is that once in a blue moon, half-second thought that maybe I'd like to have just one but as soon as I focus in on it, I shake it off.

I've learned not to ignore those thoughts. Instead, I really focus in on what having "just one" would mean. Part of that is that there's no such thing as "just one," but also every nasty, self-sabatoging thing that goes along with smoking. It's gross and it's sad. I think about all that and move on. The whole thing lasts a few seconds, at most. I hardly register it as part of my day (or months, as that's how rare it seems).

Anyway, in observance of my 700 days, I encourage those who've just quit to keep moving forward because every day is slightly better than the last. Eventually, you won't believe how great you feel. And honestly, I'm not any smarter and I don't have any more willpower than any of the rest of you. If I can quit, you absolutely can too.

Today i will quit, 24 years old student 13 years of smoking

I smoked for 13 years and the biggest break from cigarettes was about 8  months. Sadly i came 4 months ago with Erasmus on Athens and i started again. I have a problem because everytime i go to a nightclub or i go with some friends out at night i feel a really big urge to smoke. For example 3 days ago i went to a nightclub with some friends and i had a week without cigarettes before, but i fucked up imeddiately once i was out and i bought a pack of cigarettes and smoked it vry fast. If i stay alone i never have those kind of problems and i'm really motivated to get in shape. I'l try to quit forever. I love kickbox  and i would love to become a pro. Good luck to others also!

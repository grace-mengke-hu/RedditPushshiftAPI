3 Months

3 Months in and no real update from my last post. Still not smoking with no issues. I pop in here every now and then and comment sometimes.

To everyone here. Thanks for sharing your stories. It helped me greatly and still does help when I pop in.

Keep up the good work. However you quit be it NRT, cold turkey or Allen Carr, keep telling yourself that you've stopped slowly killing yourself and that you deserve nice things bought with all the money you're saving.

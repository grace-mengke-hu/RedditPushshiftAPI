1 year +

I'm a few days late, but happy 1 year smoke free! It sounds weird, but I feel like I've been a non-smoker longer than a year and I always hope I feel that way. Now I won't be looking as closely anymore except for yearly anniversaries of course. It was one of the most remarkable years of my life. I quit smoking, my beautiful daughter was born, and we moved into our first house! It doesn't get much better than that, but I sure hope it will! Join me in not smoking today, will you please?

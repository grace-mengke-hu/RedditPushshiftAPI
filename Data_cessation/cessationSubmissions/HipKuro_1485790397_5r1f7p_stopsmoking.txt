Week three huge cravings

I read on here, somewhere, that there the worst times are day 3, week 3, and month 3. I just recently started my third week nicotine free and have had massive cravings today and yesterday. The cravings dont last long but they are very strong. 

Stay vigilant, folks. It isnt out of your system yet I guess. Dont get tricked into having"just one for old times sake" or thinking just one wont hurt.

Nostalgia under the influence

4 &amp; a half months in. Undefeated (forever, hopefully). The danger is real. Nostalgia when sober is nothing compared to when under the influence of alcohol. I was a smoker for close to 8 years. I can't count the number of times I got drunk during those eight years but I can count the number of times I got drunk without smoking a cigarette-3. I used to smoke a pack a day. For every cigarette that I smoked that gave me a sense of pleasure I remember a thousand more that didn't that I smoked because the nicotine addict in me demanded it. I wont smoke a cigarette again. Not today. Tomorrow is another day. To all the people who have quit recently. I have come far and there are weeks that go by without me thinking about a cigarette. I hope you get there too. Alcohol lowers inhibitions &amp; most definitely does not promote rational thinking. Beware. Always be aware that smoking may suddenly not seem so ridiculous anymore. It isn't going to be easy. I've learned to accept years of drug addiction can't be cured in days. To all the people across the world who are confused whether the withdrawal will ever end all I have to say is this. Take it one day at a time. I won't smoke today. Tomorrow is another day.

2000 Days!

Man, it seems like a week at times and like an eternity at others...

For those of you who are still in the single or double-digits, 2,000 may seem like an impossibility. It isn't. Keep on reminding yourself that you're stronger than some stupid plant wrapped in paper and that you can get past the cravings for five more minutes. Then five more minutes after that. 

**I believe in you**. 

You ***can*** do it!

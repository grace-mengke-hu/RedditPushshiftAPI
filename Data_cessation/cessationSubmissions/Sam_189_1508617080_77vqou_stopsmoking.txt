Started reading Allen Carr's book a couple hours ago. I'm on page 60 now.

I just passed his chapter on the advantages of being a smoker. That gave me a pretty good chuckle! I'm trying to finish the entire book by the end of the day. And I hope it will be as seemingly magical as he says it is. Hoping that I'll finish the book and never want to pick up a cigarette again. And that it will be easy!

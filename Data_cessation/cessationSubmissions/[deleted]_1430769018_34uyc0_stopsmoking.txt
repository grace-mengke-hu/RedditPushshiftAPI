My story is a bit weird.

I've started smoking last year, on January 2014.
I am now 17 and smoke free.
I wasn't actually planning to quick smoking, but this last sunday I had a weird dream, I dreamed of not being able to breathe because of cigarettes, and then my father sending me to the doctor to get myself fixed.
I fucked ticked at that moment. That morning I woke up without ever wanting to smoke a cigarette, and I have been smoke free for 1 day now.
Definitely not going to try that anymore.

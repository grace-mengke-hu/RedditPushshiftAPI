When does it get easier?

I smoked for 14 yrs, then switched to vaping and did that for about 5 yrs because I didn't really have any intention to quit. This past year I've been smoking every weekend with my wife while we drink. She recently got pregnant so as a courtesy I decided to quit smoking/vaping/drinking with her. 

I did about 1 week of vaping 0 nicotine liquid and then quit altogether. So I should be getting pretty close to 2 weeks now with no nicotine. It wasn't too bad at all until last night and today. For whatever reason I've been obsessing and imagining smoking a cigarette more than I have since I stopped my nicotine intake. Any ideas when this will pass or what will help?

The irony of this all is that quitting feels like suffocating. The best I can describe is it feels like both my mouth and nose are fully covered with a tiny air hole. Just enough air is able to get through so I don't die, but not enough to get good full breaths of air. The past 2 days I've been feeling this more than over the past 2 weeks.

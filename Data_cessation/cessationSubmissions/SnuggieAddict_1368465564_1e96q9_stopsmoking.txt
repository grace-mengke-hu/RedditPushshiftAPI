Week 1 - Done. Hello, Week 2!

Well, the first week is over. It seems like forever.
The Good - I'm feeling good. I'm energetic, I have great mood, I smell stuff and I'm super proud at myself.
The Bad - I have cravings. Many. About 10 times a day I think "Man, I would like a cigarette now". When I see people who smoke I kind of envy them. I'm not going to smoke but this makes me quite uncomfortable.
The Ugly - What comes out of my nose, but I shall spare you the details.

So, any words of encouragments? I'm waiting to that moment of relevation alan carr spoked of in his book, when smoking won't seem like fun and I won't be jealous of smokers. Still waiting, though. I promised myself that if I keep feeling so jealous at a month, I'll go for a reinforcment meeting.

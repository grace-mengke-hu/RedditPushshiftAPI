Am I Doomed to Fail?

Hi all, first ever reddit post! So exciting! Hope this all makes sense!

 

Having smoked 20 a day for around 15 years, I have been trying (and failing) to quit cold turkey for the past month. My current routine goes along the lines of:

1 - Stop smoking for around 24-72 hours

2 - Give in and buy a pack of 10

3 - Smoke them all in the space of a few hours

4 - Repeat from step 1


There's never anything specific that triggers it as such, I can get through regular cravings it's just a voice in my head that turns up and won't stop. I've tried distracting myself so many different ways but it just will not leave me alone until I smoke.


Everything I've read about successfully quitting talks about using your reasons for quitting to get through tough times like this but I think my problem is that I don't have anything I can point to as my reason. Sure, there's a million health benefits, the money saved would be nice and not having to stand outside in the freezing cold and rain would be better but I live for those 5 minutes of peace where nobody bothers me and I can just be alone with my thoughts.


Basically, my question is; does having a solid reason to quit actually help or am I just using it as an excuse for having zero willpower?

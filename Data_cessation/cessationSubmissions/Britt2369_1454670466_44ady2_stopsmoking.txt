I was doing well :(

Was 2 days from 2 months and I broke down and had "just one" that just one that I warned so many people on here not to have. After just one, I was good! Or so I thought. Next day I had just one more, and so on for 3 days. Until yesterday. I probably had about 4 in total. 

To say I'm angry at myself is an understatement. I'm having a very hard time convincing myself that I don't want to smoke. It's not about feeling like I NEED it, each time I never even really craved them. Just felt a smoke would be nice. 

I avoided coming to this sub over the last week. I didn't want to reset my time. I also avoided my quit smoking apps and figured since I hadn't fully relapsed I didn't need to reset. But obviously I was well on my way to a full relapse. So I decided to reset on here and on my quit smoking app.. I think it's really the only way to fully accept my relapse and try again! 
I JUST went through this and made it 2 months. I know I can do it again. I just have to actually try which I haven't been doing much this last week! 

Remember quitters, as I've said here many times, that "just one" is never just one.

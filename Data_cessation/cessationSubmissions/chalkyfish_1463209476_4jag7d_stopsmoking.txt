Tonight is the big test: encouragement and tips appreciated

Hey all,

So I have done 6 days, and if I remain smoke free tonight then its a whole week. Overall its been actually not too bad, however I have been staying away from other smokers and most of all - alcohol.

Tonight I am going to a party with a few people who are casual smokers when they drink, also one beer and my brain automatically goes - I need a cigarette. 

My plan is:

Stay indoors, don't go outside with the smokers at any point.
Realise that it is not an 'irresistible urge' - I can resist it.
Wait ten minutes when I get a craving. 
Eat food when craving.
Distract myself!

Any other tips?

Wish me luck!

Don't kid yourself. Quitting is extremely hard, and serious business.

Wow, over 1000 days. Quite an accomplishment. What worked for me was spending 3 days in bed just sleeping it away to get that initial bankroll sobriety. Countless times whitenuckleing it while driving on the edge of my seat chewing on a piece of rope. It took me a solid 3 months of doubt if this dam shark is ever going to stop chewing my arm off, cravings. Gums and patches did not work for me. I started because I was curious why my parents couldn't quit, and I quit because I could no longer snowboard one of my life passions. Funny.  Quitting cigs started a journey of a healthy life-style; that is, healthy choices over unhealthy ones.

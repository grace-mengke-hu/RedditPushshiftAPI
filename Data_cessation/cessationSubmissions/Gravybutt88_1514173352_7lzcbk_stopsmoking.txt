So when will this get easier?

Being an EX 2 pack a day smoker has made me very proud and accomplished but right now seems to be a real struggle and I almost caved. Im going on day 10 tomorrow but man was today hard. 

Not sure if it was the stresses of xmas eve (assuming tomorrow will be the same)  or what not but damn damn damn! Ive been vaping to quit and so far its worked great. 

Is it just one of “those days?” I mean as I type this im having one of the cravings that’s making my mouth water but I keep putting it off by vaping (lowest nic) and it helps me carry on. 

Hopefully this passes soon because its the only thing on my mind!

E-cig (Vaping) to stop smoking

I got an e-cig, its working brilliantly. Currently puffing on 11mg/ml, of some berry flavoured stuff. But my question is how long should I wait to drop my nicotine dose down? Additionally I'm considering mixing my own E-liquid to make the incremental decrease really small perhaps 2mg at a time. Any experiences with this sort of method would be much appreciated!

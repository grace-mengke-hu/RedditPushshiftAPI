Just relapsed after thirty days of hell following reading Easyway - what are my other options?

I did the whole Easyway thing with some friends, we all read the book and all watched the DVD and all quit smoking. I was one of the most addicted, but a few were on my level or beyond. For all of them it worked great - didn't feel like they were losing anything by quitting and cravings disapated quickly. I felt like shit the whole time, my social life and work suffered and I wanted a cigarette every five or ten minutes. I feel motivated and not depressed for the first time since I quit after having a few cigarettes today.

I really, REALLY want to quit but I don't think Easyway is the method for me. I'm open to anything else, does anyone have suggestions or similar experiences? Thank you.

10 days without a single cig

Smoked for 15 years. I'm using an e-cig for when I'm desperate (i.e. at the pub) but feeling proud of myself. For all you thinking about quitting, the best thing I've noticed is that my lung capacity and ease of breathing improved so much after just five days. Feeling that change is a great incentive. YOU CAN DO IT!

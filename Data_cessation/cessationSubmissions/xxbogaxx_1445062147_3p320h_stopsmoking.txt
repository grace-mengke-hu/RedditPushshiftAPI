I need help not to cave in

So today marks the 15th day of my journey. Ive been feeling better lately with weaker urges and less mood swings. However, my best friend is leaving the country for good tomorrow and I've been stressing out super hard the past couple days. I really need help to take my mind off of smoking whenever i feel weak and lonely. Any help would be appreciated.

Weird. Day 9 turns out to be a toughie this time.

Hanging in there anyway. This quit's been pretty easy, but last night/this a.m. I'm just mildly grumpy, almost narcoleptically tired, and craving more than I have this entire quit.  
It's early morning and I'm working on setting up better routines for my days, and my brain is telling me that I need to smoke as a preliminary, preparatory step before I do anything. I was reading a book about habits earlier that is helping me analyze that. My verdict at the moment is that I need stimulation and 10 minutes to chill out before starting my day full-on. Gonna try a cup of coffee outside for 10, then go for a run. It might be one one of those days. I'm ready for these to be behind me!  
Annyyway. Keep on, everybody! Mostly, this quit's been so good--I feel SO much better than I did 2 weeks ago, it's insane. Even today. It's worth it. Luck to all!

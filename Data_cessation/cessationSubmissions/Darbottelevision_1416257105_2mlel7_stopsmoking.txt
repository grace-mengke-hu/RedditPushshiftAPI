One week. Fifth time.

Started when I was 17. I just turned 25. This seems to be a common time frame for quitters I see. The first time I realized I was addicted was the day after a show where I'd stayed up all night. A friend gave me a diet pill to stay awake. I spent my entire shift that next day smoking and smoking. I thought it was just a one day thing. Nope! I have been through ALL of it. Gum, chantix, that brainwash (in a good way) book. I literally have felt almost every phase there is to quitting. There's so many different ways to see it. I know the psychological process. I know all excuses I made before. I know all the reasons I went back before. I know nicotine addiction is a huge liar.  I'm really really proud this time. Being proud for a while is a really good way to keep yourself from it. I'm so terrified but so hopeful. I honestly believe that you have to fall back a few times before you really do it for real. I just wish there were a way to teach youth exactly how awful addiction really is. If I'd understood, I may have never started......anyhow just wanted to express...and really love this sub. I use it for strength and ideas to keep my mind off it! Xo

Week One - Cold Turkey

After four years of smoking almost a pack a day, I’ve officially crossed the one week threshold for not smoking. It’s been incredibly hard and maybe it wasn’t the best idea to do it during holiday break but I just want to say to all of you who struggle, who fight with your parents and friends about smoking every time you speak, to those people I say, there is hope. Cold turkey is by far the hardest method for quitting but is also the most rewarding. 

My recommendations:

1) tons and tons of water
2) be liberal with ibuprofen
3) no drinking (you’ll get super dehydrated)
4) nap frequently to soldier through days 1-3 (day two was the worst for me)
5) use a sleep aid - whether it’s weed or whatever, use it. The biggest surprise of quitting for me was how hard it’s been to fall asleep at night without a cigarette
6) before you go to the store to buy a pack when you’re stressed out by family drama, set a five minute timer on your phone, go for a walk, and reevaluate at the end. Chances are, you’ll want that cigarette less.
7) this is honestly the most important one: DONT VAPE or at least nothing with nicotine in it. People seem fond of weening off cigarettes by using an e cig or patches but I’ve found that while they help those first few days, when you stop using them, relapse is almost inevitable. You’ll end up getting more addicted while not smoking actual cigarettes and then just end right back at 7/11.

Happy holidays everyone, best of luck. 

Edit: for every ten people that join me in solidarity, I’ll donate a dollar to Roswell.

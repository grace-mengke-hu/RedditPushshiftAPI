Quitting tips

I've tried quitting before but only really managed to cut my smoking down,  recently i've fallen back into smoking regularly and i'm back to cutting down using nicoret gum.

I'm looking for some general tips to stop smoking, preferably cold turkey and i'm not quite sure where to start. 

I've tried vaping, but it's just not my cup of tea. I'd appreciate any help/advice

edit: Thank you all for the advice and links, I'll put it to good use

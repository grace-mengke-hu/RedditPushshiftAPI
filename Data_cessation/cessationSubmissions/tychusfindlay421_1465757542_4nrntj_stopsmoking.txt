Quitting makes me depressed

I'm 29, I've smoked on and off since 18, and dipped since I was 24.

I haven't had any tobacco in 24 hours which is a record. But it's like I can't enjoy anything without tobacco. Every time I daydream about my future, it's something like "me with my girlfriend at a baseball game... and I'm dipping" or "riding my motorcycle in the hills at sunset and getting a good view of the city... and then I smoke some cigarettes". All my happy memories involve tobacco, and it's like I can't imagine life without it. But I want to. I just worry that my life will be empty except for cravings. Anyone else?

I know that if I could smoke just one more cigarette, the second I take a puff I'll think "Oh yeah much better, I'm totally ready to quit now!" which we all know is bullshit.

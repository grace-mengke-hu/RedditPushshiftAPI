2 Months smoke free, Can't wait until I'm craving free too!

If that ever happens! Although I must say I feel close. Never thought I'd make it to the 2 month mark, cold turkey, not so much as a drag.

I did buy an e-cig which I only really use when the craving's high (ie. sitting with someone who is smoking or after watching mad men lol).

Day to day cravings are gone, now it really only hits when I see someone enjoying a smoke on the patio, or after a few drinks with smoker friends. I do find myself wondering how bad one little drag could really be, but I've come this far I know it isn't worth it!

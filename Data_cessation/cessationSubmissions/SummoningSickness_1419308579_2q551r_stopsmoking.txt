I'll give $2,750 to the first smoker that can quit for a year

Ok not really. I can't afford to do something like that, but if I caught your attention and you were suddenly thinking about stopping to make that money, that is how much you would save in a year if you were to quit. (1 pack a day, $7.50 a pack)
Right now is as good a time to stop as ever. You don't need it and will prove how strong a person you are once you get past it.

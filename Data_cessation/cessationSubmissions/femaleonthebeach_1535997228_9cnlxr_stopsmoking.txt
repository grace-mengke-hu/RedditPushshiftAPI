Dealing with failure

Today was my quit day and I relapsed. I was having a panic attack and I fell victim to the excuses of "just one more day to deal with this, today is too hard, etc."

As soon as I lit up the cigarette, I felt like shit. About myself for not just sticking with it. About smoking in general. About all the damage I've done to myself smoking for 10 years.

In the past, when I gave myself "one more day," I felt a lot more okay about it, even looking forward to enjoying cigarettes that day. Today, I don't feel okay about it at all. I wish so badly I had stuck with my plan. I didn't even enjoy the smoking like I used to. 

In fact, smoking for a whole extra day sounds hellish to me right now. I guess I could use advice and support.

Can I leverage these negative feelings positively to be more determined to stick with it next time? When should next time be?

Part of me just wants to try to go cold turkey today even though I messed up this morning. The other part of me knows this might make it a lot harder for me because once I have my first cigarette of the day, the cravings for more are always a lot stronger. Any advice or support in general, and in particular from those who've had success at quitting cold turkey?

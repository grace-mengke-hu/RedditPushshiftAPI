GEEZ How do I stop eating so much! I am eating something every few minutes now....

Now I seem to be eating more than I was smoking. I am eating trail mix, peanuts, french fries, ice cream, and pretty much anything I can get my hands on. 

I tried chewing a straw for a few days but that got to be nasty. I didnt like the plastic taste. 

Has anyone else found something to get them to stop eating?

The cost of smoking is insane actually ...

A pack of smokes (19 cigs) costs € 5.5 (prices are rising a lot due to taxes lately) ... I smoked a package a day ... resulting in €165 / month  just for smoking. Extrapolated to a year this becomes €1980 / year.

That's actually 1/4 of what I yearly need to pay of my house!

edit: maybe it's cool if everyone said what they are spending their used-to-be-smokes-money on since they quit?

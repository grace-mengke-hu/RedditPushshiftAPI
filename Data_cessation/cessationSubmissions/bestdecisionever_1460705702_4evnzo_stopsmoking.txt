Day 3 complete

Had a major craving this morning, but I let it take its time and go away. I am scared a bit that I will have this craving feeling for the rest of my life, but I know its not true. I just have to let my brain realize that. The only thing that I have to do is not to smoke. Plain and simple. Thanks for reading.

I have survived music festival without a puff

Since I have stopped smoking 3+ months ago, I have always feared the day that a music festival i had tickets for would come. Until this year, every music fest was at least 1.5 pack / day. And I had no idea how I would handle all the alcohol and smoke (also marihuana smoke) at the same time. But guess what. I had absolutely no craving during the whole thing. Sure, the hiphop concerts and cannabis smoke did bring some nostalgia, and I did feel tempted, but a craving? Nah, I would not call it that. It was a mere thought.

So to all of you who are starting to quit - just get through the first few weeks, I know it now feels unimaginable that one day you will not think about a cigarette for a whole day or even week. But believe me, it gets only easier. And soon, you can be surrounded by Marlboro men in circle and all youll ferl is pity for them.

Good luck to you all, I feel like I no longer need this community to help me, but I will try to help others when I get time. 

You can do it.

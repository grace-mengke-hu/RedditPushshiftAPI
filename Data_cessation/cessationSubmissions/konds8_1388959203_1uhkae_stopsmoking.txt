HOW are you guys doing it?

Seriously.
I see those 1week, 30 days, 90days, one year posts everywhere. And here I am not even able to quit for a whole day. I read allen carrs book and I managed to go for 4 days and then slipped.
 I can easily survive the whole day but once it becomes evening I start to struggle. I play with the thought about smoking one, then think about the disadvantages and advantages. Until its unbearable.
I suddenly feel really anxious and end up buying a pack.

Even though I feel AWESOME when I don't smoke. Even though I know I'll regret smoking again and I'll feel like complete shit again. They seriously fuck me up and drain all my energy out. And yet still can't go for a whole day. 

I know all this and yet I am not able to go a whole fucking day without 1 cigarette. 
It fucking annoys me that my life is all about those fucking cancersticks. And now I am in an even weirder position. Because I only smoke at evening. 
For the past 3 days I've been smoking only at the evening and it honestly feels almost worse, because I feel irritated all day long until i can't take it anymore and smoke again. Such a weird cycle. I feel really stuck. At least when I was smoking a pack a day I didn't have to deal with this. 

Can anybody help me? I tried these apps, affirmations, read the book. Nothing really helped. If I could just go past day one, I would be soo happy.

The e-cig is making me cough and I'm not ready to quit everything all together

So I quit smoking almost a month ago and it was pretty easy. I would occasionally smoke the e-cig if the cravings ever got too bad. Didn't happen much at first but then I started to enjoy the vape and increase it. What also helped is that I was fasting in Ramadan so my cravings were limited to night time so there weren't that many. 

A couple of days ago I started coughing and now I have a full blown infection with green mucus and a horrible cough. I'm pretty sure it's the e-cig because I just feel my lungs getting agitated when I inhale. 

Now I stopped the e-cig but I bought a pack. I'm not ready to be off everything and I feel like this is being forced on me due to the cough. 

It's so hard to resist smoking and I already smoked 3 over 2 days. I don't want to waste a "fresh start". Any advice?

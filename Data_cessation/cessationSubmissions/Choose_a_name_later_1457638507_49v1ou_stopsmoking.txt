620

Lost my reddit account about a year ago (register your email, kids) and was unable to reclaim my badge. I still think about smoking,  still have dreams I relapse. Still haven't caved. I never could have done it without my anonymous friends and fake Internet points. I don't think I need the badge anymore. Day 620. High score.

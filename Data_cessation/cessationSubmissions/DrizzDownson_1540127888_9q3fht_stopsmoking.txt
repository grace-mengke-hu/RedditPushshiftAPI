It's never just one cigarette!!

Having been a very happy ex smoker for about 3 years I thought I could get away with having just one cigarette on a drunken night out 5 months ago. Within the space of 2 months following that night I was back on 10-20 a day

There is no such thing as just one cigarette! 

So here goes me quitting again (forever this time). Re-read Easyway by Allen Carr and am on day two of no smoking feeling super positive. Wish me luck!

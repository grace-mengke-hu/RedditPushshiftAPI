I'm really proud of myself

I've been smoke free for 7 days now. It was raining today and I put on a jacket I hadn't worn in awhile. There was half a pack of cigarettes in the pocket. Let me tell you, that was a difficult moment. I thought, I could have one, and no one would know. I left them on the car seat all the way to work, and kept looking over at them thinking I could just light one. I didn't. When I got to work, I took them all out and crumpled them up and threw them away. Sigh. It was hard, but I did it!

Quitting in the midst of stressful situations

My mom's lung cancer came back, the doctors said it isn't cureable. 

So I had to quit smoking, I owe that to my mom, to my family and to my own future. I decided to quit Sunday, because, I always hated February and figured it can't get much worse.

Yet, the second day almost passed, and I am so stressed about everything. New semester at college started today, I can't focus on anything, I am scared most of the time, I lost my wallet over the weekend, etc.

What I miss about smoking are those few minutes of time alone, of doing nothing, I can use to relax and think things through. After a smoke break, nothing seemed that bad anymore. Now, I need something else for those moments. What's the best replacement according to you all?

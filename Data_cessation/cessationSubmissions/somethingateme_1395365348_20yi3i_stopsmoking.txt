It really is easier than you think.

One hint I have learned in my 19 days of quitting cold turkey; the cravings only last as long as you think about them.

If you get a craving, think about something else.  Seriously, that has been my life saver.  I had a very stressful time last night, but once I realized i had a craving for a smoke, I gently turned my mind away from that and onto something else.  EASY-PEASY.  You don't need to smoke, and it is only a craving that will pass.  and it passes much faster if you think about something else.

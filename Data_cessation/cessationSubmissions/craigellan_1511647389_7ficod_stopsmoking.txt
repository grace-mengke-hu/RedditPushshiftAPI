Back pain after quitting?

Anyone experience any lower back pain after quitting.  Im almost two weeks in, I dont think Im coughing too much, definitely not having any coughs that hurt.  However, have felt some lower left back pain past week.  Not sure if this is from breathing more heavily or what.  Overall, I definitely feel 100% better since Ive quit, just have this nagging pain. Wanted to see if anyone else experienced this.  Thanks!

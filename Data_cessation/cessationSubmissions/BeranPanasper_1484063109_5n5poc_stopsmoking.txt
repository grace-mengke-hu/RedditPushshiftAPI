I did it too!

34yo here.  Smoked cigarettes everyday for 18 years. Last month, my 6yo asked me if smoking is good for health. Didn't want to lie so I said no, little shit asked why I'm smoking then. Couldn't look at him in the eyes then. I said I would stop after NYE, he said OK. And I did it. 9 days already. And I don't want to be back at it - never. First because it would change how my son look at me forever. And second, because actually I came to the realisation that cigarettes are the worst shit out there for me, by far.

Next, /r/stopdrinking! I start to feel confident I can do that, too...

And thanks to all the folks who share their story here - it helps a lot! Take care and keep it up :)

Gotta quit

Hey everyone. I just got a new job at a hospital, and they test for nicotine, so I gotta quit cold turkey. No vaping, no patch. I've been smoking on and off for 10 years (since I was 14), but I'm glad that I'm being forced to quit, because otherwise I'd probably never stop. 

My question is: how do you deal with your anxiety after you quit? If I'm nervous or upset or can't sleep or even if I'm just acting like an asshole and I know I'm pissing off my family, a cigarette is like a reset button for me. I come back inside and I'm calm and ready to deal with whatever's going on. 

I don't know how to do that without cigarettes. I'm worried that I'll just be an anxious, insomniac asshole now. Any advice?

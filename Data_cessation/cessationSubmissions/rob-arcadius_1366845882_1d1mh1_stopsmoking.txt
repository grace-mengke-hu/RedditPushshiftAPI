Ignore my badge

I've been smoking this whole time. I made it about a week when I punched that badge in and now I'm really depressed at how long I let myself fall back into the spiral.
This morning I almost burnt my family's house to the ground. I don't like to smoke in sight of my family because they are angrily aggressive about me smoking at all in the first place, so I hid a little bucket to throw butts in behind the garage. Well I'm here to tell you that cigarettes can and will in fact start a fire. The entire time that I used the hidden bucket I always made sure to put my butts out and make sure that I wasn't causing a hazard, but I guess I didn't check close enough.
I put my last cig out in that bucket at I think 9pm (est) last night. It took til about 6am for that one cig to smolder through the mulch, the bucket, and when my father discovered it, a trail of embers slowly growing out of the garden toward the house, patio, garage, everything.
I'm done. Not doing it for the badge, for health, for myself, or others. I'm just done.

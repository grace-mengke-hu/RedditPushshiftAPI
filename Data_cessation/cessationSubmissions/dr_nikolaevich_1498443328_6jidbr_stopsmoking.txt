1000 hours smoke free! There are things I miss, though...

Sounds better in hours, doesn't it? :)

I smoked for almost 9 years, and stopped because I was sick of it. I quit cold turkey and had a rough first week but since then everything's been fine, and now days can go by and I don't even think of cigarettes.

However, I do miss the occasional cigarillo or a bowl of nice pipe tobacco. I promised myself I wound touch anything tobacco related for a long time, but I would like to be able to smoke a pipe once in a while sometime in the future. Even when I was a cigarette smoker, I never craved smoking a pipe, nor did it give me the nicotine hit I needed because every time I finished a bowl I would light up a cigarette. It was always a ritual, and one I actually miss. Did any of you go through something similar? Should I just let it all go? Looking forward to your replies.

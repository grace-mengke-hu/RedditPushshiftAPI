Hope.

Hey guys.  I've posted here a few times.  I don't have a badge, and unfortunately, I don't know people here.
But I have gone for nearly two months cigarette free.  And coming nearly on a month nicotine free.
I still feel cravings.  Thinking about not smoking takes up much of my time.
But, I also feel hope.  
I feel better than I have since I started smoking 15 some years ago.  
This feels like a bit like a useless post, but mostly, I'm doing it for my benefit, because unfortunately, I don't really have the support from anyone else. 
For what its worth, thanks for the encouragement I get just by lurking here for as long as I have.  Its taken a bit of time to actually get myself to talk to my doctor, and a good bit of that time was spent here reading about everyone's experiences.  
I hope I can continue.
I hope everyone here can also.
Thanks again, everyone here.  
Good luck.

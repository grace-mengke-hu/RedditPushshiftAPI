survived day 3 cold turkey!

Day three was very rough. I was insanely antsy all day at work, I had to keep doing things. After work I couldn't be home alone or I was scared I would cave so I just went from cafe to cafe to get coffee with different people (I wasn't drinking coffee. caffeine makes me want to smoke). After I finally got home late I went to the gym. I burned 700 calories on the treadmill and It was much easier than usual. My breathing feels so much better. It feels like I get more oxygen out of every breath. It's an odd thing to be aware of.

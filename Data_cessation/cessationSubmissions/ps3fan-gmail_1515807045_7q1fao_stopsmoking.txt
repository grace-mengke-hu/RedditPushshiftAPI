Help!

I am an Ex-dipper, but the dip subreddit doesn't have any active users. I have been dipping for the past 10 years 2 tins a day which according to the internet is the equivalent of 8 packs a day of nicotine(this sounds like BS to me, but I found it on multiple websites). I will be 30 days clean in a few hours, but I still am exhausted every single morning and then I can't sleep at night. Any tips from ex smokers on dealing with this? I also can't concentrate anymore. Any idea how long that lasts? Everything else I can deal with, but being dead tired all day at work and not being able to concentrate is really killing me. Please help. Thanks!

Edit: also I have been doing a ton of cardio/weight lifting to try and burn myself out enough to get to sleep, but it isn't really helping me all that much.

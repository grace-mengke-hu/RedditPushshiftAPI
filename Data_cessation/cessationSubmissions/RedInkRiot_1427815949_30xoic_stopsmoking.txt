Are you a stubborn person? Leverage that shit and use it as your greatest weapon against nicotine.

I almost caved yesterday. I walked into the gas station with the full intention of buying a pack. My mental chatter had gotten the better of me, and I was ready to throw away the last three weeks of intermittent hell.

But as I approached the checkout counter and glanced at the tobacco products, about to make my final decision, I realized I couldn't bring myself to face my loved ones again after another (what would have been my 8th in as many years) failure.

Not to mention, my husband - who is also quitting - had bought a pack over his lunch hour, and I had spent several minutes pep talking him and trying to motivate him to throw it away and keep trying. I realized I couldn't be that big of a hypocrite just an hour later. So I got stubborn about it. I put my foot down and decided I would show the monster in my head who is the boss (and also maybe motivate my husband in the meantime).

I didn't cave. And I feel like a fucking badass today because of my willpower. 

Anyone out there struggling...get stubborn about it. Get pissed off at nicotine and what it has taken from you, and use that to your advantage in this fight. We can fucking do this!

I'm very proud to have my 3-week badge today!!! :D

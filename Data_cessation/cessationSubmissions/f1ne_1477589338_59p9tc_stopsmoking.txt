Day 2, it's quitting season

I sat in the break room at work yesterday for the first time next to a girl I'm normally outside smoking with. Coincidentally, me, her, and another coworker all quit on the same day!

I'm using the patch and it's much easier than I expected. It feels like something is missing, but I'm not having many cravings at all. Even yesterday I felt fine enough to stay at work 2 and a half hours late.

Today might be a bit more of a struggle because I'm off work. But so far, so good, I'm feeling fine and not going to smoke.

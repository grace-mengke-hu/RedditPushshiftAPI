I just can't seem to find the motivation.

I've only been smoking for around 4 years but I'm hooked pretty bad. I quit once for 8 months and then I had an avalanche of very unfortunate events happen in my life which knocked me off the wagon (my own fault, I should've been stronger). 

I've tried to quit a few times since then and made it about a week or just a few days. I know it's bad for my health, I know it costs an obscene amount of money, and on top of it I'm trying to save money to go back to school so I have ever reason to quit but I just can't seem to find that kick in the ass to make me do it again for good this time. 

I like to think I have decent willpower, but there's just something about smoking that holds onto me. Any advice or tips would be appreciated because just last month my uncle died from a heart attack caused by his years of smoking, and I just went up and down the stairs in my house once and I'm slightly out of breath. This needs to stop.

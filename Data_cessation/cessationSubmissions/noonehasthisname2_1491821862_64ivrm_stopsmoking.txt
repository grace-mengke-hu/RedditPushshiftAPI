2 weeks today !

Sorry if the formatting is odd, I'm on mobile.

Today I am 14 days clear of smoking, cold turkey (20 year old,smoked around 15 a day for 4 years). After the first 5 days my cravings had dramatically reduced. By now I just occasionally get the feeling I am missing something

Since then I have avoided 163 cigarettes and seen a lot of improvements. I'm breathing a lot more freely and have seen great improvements in my fitness already. The main thing I've noticed is an improvement in my sleeping; not having to sleep for so long and feeling more refreshed.

Cold turkey was the only way for me. I have tried NRT several times and I always went back to the smokes. If it's working for you more power to you! Good luck to everyone on their own journeys! It's always worth it.

How to properly help my brother stop smoking cigarettes and marijuana

Hello all, my brother has been trying to quit smoking. He mostly smokes self rolled cigarettes and joints with weed and tobacco mixed. Yesterday, he gave me all of his smoking gear and has gotten a vape pen to satisfy him. I hid all of the gear and locked t with a padlock that I have the key to. However, he requests that tonight I allow him to smoke 1 joint (with weed and tobacco inside) as he can’t sleep without it. I asked him why he couldn’t take melatonin to help him sleep but he claimed it wouldn’t work. My question is, should I give it to him or not?

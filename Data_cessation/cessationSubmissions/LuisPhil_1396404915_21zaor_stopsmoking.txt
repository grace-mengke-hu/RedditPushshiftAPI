Day 23 but still struggling

Im 39 started around 20. Ive been free for 23 days but i still struggle with it. My mind plays tricks it draws up random memories and says you wont be able to enjoy it like before without the cigg. Sometimes i still doubt that i can do it. The cravings are less but when they do hit they are more intense. I do have Allen Carrs book up to page 24. I had already stopped before i started reading the book. Not much of a reader but i think i will try to get through book.

Help with today’s temptations!

So today is my 21st day smoke-free (yay!) but there are a few obstacles facing me today and I’m worried I’ll cave, so I thought the best thing to do was to share it here for accountability.

I have been using an e-cig as NRT for when I go out drinking, as that’s when I crave the most. HOWEVER I lost my new (expensive) vape in an Uber during the week and today I’m going to a party where we’ll be outdoors in the sun drinking wine all day. Some other people going will definitely be smoking.

What should I do to avoid being tempted? Thinking maybe I should go buy a new replacement pen before I go over. Expensive but not as much as smoking again I guess. Nervous!

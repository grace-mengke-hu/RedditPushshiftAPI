Day 1

I had my last cigarette last night. I was out and smoked my last one. I decided not to get any more on my way home. I didn't really think about it that much, that was just the decision I made.



Lately I've been thinking a lot about why I do the things I do...mostly bad habits. 

Smoking allows me to "check out" for a minute. To turn away from everything that is happening and shut off. I have appreciated that experience many times over the past 7 years. But I don't want to do it anymore. I want to deal with my problems. I want to not feel like I have to have a cigarette if I'm in a stressful situation. I don't want this bad habit to have as much power in my life as it does.. Smoke on the way to work. Smoke at beginning of lunch break. Smoke at end of lunch break. Smoke on the way home. Smoking before and after literally everything I do. So much wasted time. So much time spent not growing by experiences being made or from dealing with challenges. So much money spent. So many times I have stood in the freezing cold or pouring rain or ridiculous heat just to wind up excluding myself from situations or people in order to have a damn cigarette. 

I'm truly over it. Here goes nothing!

8 years a slave, now 2 mos free! Just want to give encouragement.

I smoked all throughout high school and college. Now my parents have gotten me one of those e cigs and they carry theirs around their necks all the time on lanyards like crutches but I left mine in my car and only smoked it when I absolutely needed to or felt a really bad urge, usually after going out drinking with all my dumb friends smoking around me.

It's weird, I didn't even need to rely on it that much. It seems during these past two months I haven't really had any cravings at all and I'm not sure why. I think it just has to do with keeping busy and not allowing your self to succumb to the peer pressure of friends around you. It was especially difficult though when I did go out drinking. So alcohol is really something to look out for there. Hopefully you all can stay vigilant and so can I. Keep up the good work I know you can do it!

edit: wow holy typos!, fixed now. i was dictating this to my phone while driving long distance. and oh ya my flair is wrong from past failures. But this time im not failing :)

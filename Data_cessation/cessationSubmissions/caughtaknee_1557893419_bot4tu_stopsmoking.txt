I started smoking when I was 17. I'm 25 now and I'm quitting today.

Sometimes the choices you make as a teenager really do haunt you as an adult. 

But I'll be honest, I hate the smell on my hair and the taste in my mouth and that dizzy feeling of finishing one now. It's awful.

I don't smoke at work and that is a normal 8 hour day so the trick for me might be staying busy. However, if you have any advice, I'd really appreciate it.

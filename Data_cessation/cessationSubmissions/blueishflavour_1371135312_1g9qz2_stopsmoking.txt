Bad news but keeping it together

Day 4 for me. Normally 10-15 a day for 5 years. Decided to quit because what's the point of throwing away money I don't have to damage my health, right?

Today I got some pretty shit news concerning what I want to do with my life. And this week has generally thrown some blows at me. But I'm managing to remind myself that this is for the best, I've through the majority of the initial withdrawal symptoms and what would be the point of going through that again. I'll put the money into buying a boat so I can get off this crappy island.

Thanks /r/stopsmoking for your stories. You have no idea how much it helps thinking of other people going through this.

P.S. Sunflower seeds suck balls.

Relapsed at the two week mark

Today would have been the start of week 3. Sadly I relapsed a hour ago. I quit while having an empty bank-account. That changed today (payday). The last two weeks Ive been having a constant dialog with myself, motivating myself why I should and want to quit. Did I just fool myself because I couldn't afford smokes?  Do I secretly not want to quit? 
Another aspect to it is that I thought my face was 'fatter' (flabby?) due to smoking. I noticed somewhat of a decrease of "flubberness" but after not sleeping well for a few nights my face was yet again fatter. Maybe I just imagined a correlation.

Also, I'm meeting an old friend, one of the 2 that I still have, since a very long time this week.  Im hoping to reestablish some sort of active friendship again. (Been isolated for 3 years). Im worried that I cant be social (or will act in an  uncomfortable manner) without a smoke - my social life has not been without smoking, ever. 

I smoked 3, jumped into the shower, cleared the ashtray and opened all doors and windows to get rid of the smoke.

Will quitting be as hard as two weeks ago? Should I wait with quitting untill Ive met the friend again?

Thanks in advance!

Having a rough day

So... I started a new job yesterday with a large corporation.  I've been running my own little business, doing freelance work for the last couple of years... 

The shock is a bit overwhelming: all the new people, the multitude of buildings I don't know how to navigate yet...

I feel so out-of-place.  I **really** want a smoke right now.

This is the first real craving I've had I. Well over a year, but it's very hard to get around right now.  I feel like a smoke will set everything right and give me some confidence that I don't have right now...

How hard would it be to quit after smoking 3 months?

So, I am 17 years old, and I started smoking three months ago, I was stupid to try but I was drunk and for some reason I thought it was a good idea, after that I started smoking after high school, usually two cigars a day, but at parties where I also drink I smoke half a pack in like 3 hours. I dont like the idea of having lung cancer in my 80s or faster and I really feel bad for my parents, because they think I am smoke free and a good kid overall (they allow me to drink as long as I dont drink to much, but that hate cigars)(I am from Romania). So my question is, how hard would it be for me to quit? And what are some helpful tips and things to know that help with quiting?

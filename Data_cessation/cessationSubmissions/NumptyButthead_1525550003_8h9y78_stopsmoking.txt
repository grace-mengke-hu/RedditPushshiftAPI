Is anyone else addicted to the habit?

Yeah, my body is addicted to nicotine. I stopped smoking about 6 months ago, and took up vaping instead. The plan was to keep reducing the nicotine until it was at 0, then stop altogether. 

I've almost reduced the nic to 0, im at 2 right now. It doesn't even feel like I'm craving the nicotine. There will be times when I'm stressed and I sit there and vape and vape and vape until I'm sick from nicotine. Even after I'm nic-sick, I have the urge to keep vaping. I don't want nicotine and the thought of it makes me sick in these times, yet I still have a horrible urge to vape or smoke. 


Does anyone else relate? I feel like that's the only thing holding me back from quitting vaping. 

TLDR: even when I'm sick from nicotine I still feel the need to vape , even when the thought of nic makes me sick. Anyone else relate? It's the only thing holding me back.

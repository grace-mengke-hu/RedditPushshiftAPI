My Day 1

I'm currently 39. started at 18. About 1.5-2 packs a week currently. My wife doesn't know i smoke. How I've hidden this from her for 13 years I'll never know. I really need the motiviation to quit. I can go away on vacation for a week and be fine. The second I'm back to work, it's old habits again. 
I've tried once before. This time I'm making it work.

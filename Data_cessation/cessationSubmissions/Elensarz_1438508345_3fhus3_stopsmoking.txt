My cravings are coming back

After a month and a half without cigarettes, I've been feeling pretty good. I still use a vape but I've whittled that down from 24 nicotine to 6. I have plans to put this down as well as I'm on my last bottle of juice! 

The last week has been rough though, a lot of personal stress and I'm getting cravings for a cig again, to the point of having smoking dreams. Did anyone else get urges again around the 1 1/2 - 2 month mark?

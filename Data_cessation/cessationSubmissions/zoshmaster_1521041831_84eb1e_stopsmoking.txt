3rd day without nicotine, coughing up a lung.

I smoked for years tried to quit a few dozen times. The longest I went without was 3 months (starting on new years.) I got bored and it was an excuse to talk to an old friend. Smoked a couple packs and switched to vaporizing, and now man I'm hacking like never before.
I'm not vaping,smoking, or any other r.o.a.(.)

First attempt. I feel like I'm gonna kill someone.

So last night i decided that was it. I was gonna tell tobacco to fuck off.

Easier said than done. I thought the best way to do it would be to buy one of those e-cigs. It's just not the same. 

I haven't had a smoke all day but I've had a few puffs on that e-cig but i feel like I'm gonna kill someone. My girlfriend is being really supportive, she's never smoked and has been wanting me to quit for a while. She actually has more of a problem with me smoking tobacco than smoking weed. 

I don't know the purpose of typing all this out, i think i just needed to vent. I'm probably looking for support. I dunno.

I can do this. Right?

...Right?

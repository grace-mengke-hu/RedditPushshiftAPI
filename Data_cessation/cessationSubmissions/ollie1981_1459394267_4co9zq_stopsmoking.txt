To the new quitters

I quit cold turkey 3 months ago after an 18 year pack-a-day addiction. Unlike most ex-smokers, I can't say I find the smell disgusting now; it's much too familiar. I can't say I never think about smoking; I still get thoughts many times a day. I'm still a little envious seeing people smoke after a meal, and I'm a little sad I don't "bond" anymore with all the other outcast smokers. But none of that matters, because, outside of the first few weeks of quitting, I finally feel normal all the time now. Forget all the health benefits and money saved and all that jazz; the best thing about quitting is not having the impression you're going to turn into a pumpkin if you don't have a cigarette real soon. Believe me, it's much much better wishing you could have a smoke while being on this side of the fence than wishing you could free yourself from the slavery while enjoying a cigarette. So if you're early in your quit and things seem pretty rough right now, just trust me and power through it, things get better and you finally get to be your true normal self again. It's a beautiful feeling.

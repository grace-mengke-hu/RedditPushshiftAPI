Minimum spend in the shop.

There's a shop on the University campus I visit when I have no cash as it's the closest place that will accept a card payment. I'm usually only going for a drink or a sandwich which is under the minimum spend. To make up the amount, I'd usually buy a pack of cigarettes as I knew I would have bought them later on anyway. Today I was actually stumped. I didn't know what to do. I panicked and ended up with 4 European stamps. Smoking was such a big part of my life, it's interesting that situations like this are occurring now and I'm noticing just how integrated it was.

**TL;DR: Didn't want to buy cigarettes, ended up with the ability to send four letters to continental Europe**

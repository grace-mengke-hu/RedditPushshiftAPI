Quitting for good this time

Have smoked 2 packs a day for 22 yrs. I am at 12 days right now. This is the longest  time I have gone without lapsing. Tired of the cost each year, coughing, trouble breathing. Using the Nicoderm patches and this time has been easier. 

Found that my coffee trigger is purely mental. I can still enjoy my coffee without a smoke. Still haven't had a beer yet. I will wait to hit 2 months before drinking one. 

What triggers are the worst for you guys? How do you combat them? Looking for other tips other than pure will power.

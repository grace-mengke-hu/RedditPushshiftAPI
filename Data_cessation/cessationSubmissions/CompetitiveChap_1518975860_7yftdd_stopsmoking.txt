Can't stop vaping. I've been at it for over 4 years.

Hey guys, I'm not a smoker per se, but i smoke cigarettes occasionally. I'm wanting to stop vaping, but I kind of know deep down that I really don't want to. I just like it too much. I've been doing it just about every day for years. 

Whenever I take adderall to study, I keep this insatiable urge to vape. It feels like I just can't stop it. I've gone through over 30ml of juice in a day before. How do I stop this?

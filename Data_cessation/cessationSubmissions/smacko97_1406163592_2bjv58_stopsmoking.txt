Update - caved - quitting again

I failed this week and smoked some. Resetting my badge, doing this again.
Things I learned:
1- The days I smoke I feel more depressed and more lethargic than the days I don't smoke
2 - the days I don't smoke I feel like I could rip someones face off, but overall I have more energy and I WANT to do more things with the time I have during the day
3 - The cravings come and go and smoking doesn't actually eliminate them any better than just waiting it out does

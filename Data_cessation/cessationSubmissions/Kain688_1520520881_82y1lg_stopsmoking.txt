Does counting cigarettes work/help ?

Hi,
I'm 22 years old, smoking since 18. Last summer I managed to quit for 2 weeks but relapsed and my other attempts were not very successful, never managed to quit for over a day. 

Lately I've been chainsmoking due to some problems in my life, and I find myself in a peculiar situation. I don't really pay for cigarettes, my parents are avid smokers and they buy their own tobacco, usually around a few kilos of different brands. 

So in order for me to have a smoke I just go to another room and make myself a cigarette. I enjoy the entire process of selecting, combining my tobacco and making a cigarette. Usually I make myself a few, around a dozen and smoke them throuout my day. The problem is I never counted them, so probably I smoked around a pack (20) a day without even realising. 

Since monday I started counting how much I smoke, everyday limiting myself to 7 hoping that the next day I'll be able to smoke one less until I stop smoking all together. While I smoke much less than before, the cravings and desire to smoke is still strong and I can't seem to go down in numbers by the day. 

My question is do you think this is a good idea ? To try and just smoke less and less until I quit or should I go cold turkey ? Do you have any other advice ?

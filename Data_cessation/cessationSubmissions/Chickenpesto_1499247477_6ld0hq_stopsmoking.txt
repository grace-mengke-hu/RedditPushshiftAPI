from 1.5 packs/day to a triathlete :)

Today marks 1 year since I quit smoking. Probably one of the best decisions I have made in my life. It is not easy, but nothing good comes easy. I can only say that it is definitely worth the struggle -
 twice as much energy, money saved, being FREE! Thank you guys for sharing your stories, I was a great help for me - especially during the first weeks of quitting. 
I also run my first sprint distance triathlon a month ago in 1h 27m. Now prepping for 1/2 Iron Man in February. Good luck to all of you guys!! If I could do it, you definitely can!

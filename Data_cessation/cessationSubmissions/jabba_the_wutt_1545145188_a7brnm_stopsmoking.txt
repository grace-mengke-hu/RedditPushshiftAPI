I'm fucking done. Done.

had a realization last night that so many of my problems are due to cigs.  i drink too much because every time i smoke a cig a grab a beer.  wife feels like i dont want to kiss her because my breath smells like cigs.  feel like shit all the time in the morning cause of cigs.  waste time at work smoking cigs.  i don't even enjoy them anymore.  none of my friends smoke.  im constantly getting up and leaving the restaruant/bar/concert/gathering to go stand by myself and feel like shit for 5 mins.  im finished.  tried to "quit" once before but my heart really wasnt in it.  this time its different.  im done with this shit running my life.  gonna grab a vape pen today in case i start getting physical cravings.  wish me luck.  actually don't this isn't about luck and i dont need luck.  i need to beat this.

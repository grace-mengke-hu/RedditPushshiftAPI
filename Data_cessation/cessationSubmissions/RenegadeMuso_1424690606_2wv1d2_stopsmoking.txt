4 Weeks completed!

Wow. What an experience thus far. 

Week 1 and 2 was rocky. Week 3 and 4 was definitely easier. I wouldn't say free sailing, but definitely easier. 

I think that non-smoking must be accompanied with additional good behaviours.  

For all the young quitters out there, including myself, here is a challenge for you. Focus on non-smoking for the 1st month, and introduce lifestyle choice changes in the 2nd month. Gym and diet!

Month 2, introduce the Gym. 
Month 3, introduce the balanced diet. 

With that said, I'm going to Gym today. 

Kudos and positive vibes, 
Renegade.

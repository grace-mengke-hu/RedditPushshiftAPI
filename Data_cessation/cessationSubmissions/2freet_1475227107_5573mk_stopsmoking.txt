Smoking in dreams

Sometimes I dream that I'm smoking. It's not the focus of the dream but I just smoke in a situation of the dream. It is so strange because I sort of regret it still dreaming, then I wake up and for a short while dream and reality cross and I feel like I failed, but of course, it was all just a dreamðŸ™‚

Someone else experienced that?

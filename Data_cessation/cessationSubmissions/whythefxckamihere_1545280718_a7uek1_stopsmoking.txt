Quitting weed and tobacco

I’ve been smoking weed/hash mixed with tobacco daily for the past 3 years and decided to quit cold turkey a few days ago because my heart started pounding hard after even a few hits (and for many other reasons), managed to go 2 days without smoking anything. The craving got me tonight and I rolled one. Predictably, my heart started pouding after a few hits so i threw it, decided i had to quit now and never smoke anything again, threw all my rolling stuff, i used my last cigarette for it so no more tobacco, nothing to yield(?) to the craving. 

Nicotine withdrawal + weed withdrawal is no gonna be fun but it’s definitely worth it. 

Any tips for the first few weeks?

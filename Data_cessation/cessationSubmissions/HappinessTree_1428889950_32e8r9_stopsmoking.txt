Had to call in sick to work because of smoking

I've been smoking a lot over the past week and due to this my lungs are feeling burnt and I've developed a hacking cough. I work in a call centre, so this is obviously not a good thing. Today I called in sick and due to being casually employed I won't get paid. I really can't believe that I've let it get to this point.

Just to let everyone know!!

You guys are awesome. I quit 3 weeks ago after 20 years of smoking and routinely check into this forum every morning. Reading all the supporting comments and positive feedback is great! Just wanted to let everyone know that just because your post doesn't have a zillion up votes, people like me really appreciate your posts. Good luck y'all and thanks!!

Ps I created an account after 2 years just to post this.

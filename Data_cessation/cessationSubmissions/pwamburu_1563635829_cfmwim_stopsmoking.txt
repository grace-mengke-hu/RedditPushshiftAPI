Day 13, feeling great!

On day 13 since I stopped smoking. First week was rough, I needed Nicorette to help me get through it. The smoke free app has been tremendous in helping me fight the psychological cravings that just creep up on you. 

I’ve tried to quit multiple times before but this time feels different, this time I feel I’m going to leave these damn cigs for good!

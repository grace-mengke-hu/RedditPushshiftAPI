Hi! I work in a hospital in the UK and I'd like to know what kind of approach you'd like healthcare professionals to take when talking to you about quitting.

We are all aware of the dangers of smoking but I'd like to know how you'd most feel comfortable with somebody offering you advice to quit.

Do you feel that there is a lack of empathy from HCP's/medical staff or do you feel that the best approach is a blunt one? 

What is it that motivates you to quit and what is it that makes you continue? Bar the obvious chemical dependency - we'll take that as read.

If you could offer anything you'd feel useful I'd appreciate it and best of luck with your cessation.

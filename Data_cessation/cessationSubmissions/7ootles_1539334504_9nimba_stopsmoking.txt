Stopped just under two weeks ago, and having a strange experience...

...I don't know how common this is, which is why I'm asking.

Basically I've stopped smoking, switching to an e-cig (which yes, I get it, is cheating, but it keeps burning tobacco out of my lungs), for "Stoptober", as an impetus to start getting a bit healthier. I've also taken up running.

The strange experience I'm having is that suddenly my sex drive is in overdrive, and it was already high to begin with. Not smoking is the only thing that's really different. Like, I'm finding myself suddenly and very intensely excited/frustrated, more intense than I remember ever experiencing since being in my mid-teens.

Is this something that's happened to others here? Or could it be the running? Or is it likely just a coincidence?

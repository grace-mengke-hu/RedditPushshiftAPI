19 days nicotine free

26, Female, 5-8 a day smoker for 10 years. 

After many failed/half-assed attempts I have finally stopped smoking. I stopped cold turkey nearly 3 weeks ago. It has been tough but it is getting easier (very slowly). The first week I was very emotional - sad, angry, excited - but now I feel like I have my emotions somewhat under control. My biggest struggle at the moment is just the random cravings that catch me off guard. It's almost like I forget that I'm now a non smoker and am ready to light up at any moment. 

How long do these random cravings hang around? A month? 6 months? 2 years?

Does anyone have any suggestions on how to manage weight gain? I feel like I'm eating my body weight in food each day and can't continue doing that long term. 

I'm so excited to be on this path and am committed to staying a non smoker, just wanting some advice from people who've been here before.

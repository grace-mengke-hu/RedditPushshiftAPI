Quitting on New Year

has anyone managed to quit on new year? I am one of those quitters who needs a specific day to quit...not that I have made it until now, but everyone I have chosen an important day it has lasted the longest. this time im just done with it..quitting in itself has been messing with my mind for too long and I just can't be bothered "quitting" anymore. so Monday it is. I will smoke my final cigarette tomorrow night. I was just wondering if there are any of you who quit on New Years and didn't fail as new years resolutions tend to not work out very often. Plus any suggestions or advice is welcome! thank you! :)

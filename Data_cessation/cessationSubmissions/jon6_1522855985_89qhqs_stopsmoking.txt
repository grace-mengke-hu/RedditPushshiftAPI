Day 4 of not smoking...

So I conquered the main part. That is I still go outside at work when the others go out. It's just nice to maintain the social aspect. And I don't smoke, nor do I accept when offered.

But today the stress has really hit me. It honestly feels like near panicking. I think part of it is I realized that I was smoking very heavily, I think 13 a day. I've quit cold turkey and I'm determined to do it but due to various factors, I've not been able to work out since I quit which really isn't helping me. So combine gym withdrawals with no smoking, it's a bit of an arrrr. Added to that, going to have a band rehearsal tonight where I'm going to try not to bite everyone's heads off with new material and a second date with a really nice girl on friday, stress stressing shitting stress. Added to that, I think I'm on my fourth coffee today... tut tut. I really don't help myself.

What do you guys do to manage the stress or try and take the edge off? I know I won't stop off and buy cigarettes but just to make sure I'm leaving my wallet at home (bar the Â£12 for rehearsal).

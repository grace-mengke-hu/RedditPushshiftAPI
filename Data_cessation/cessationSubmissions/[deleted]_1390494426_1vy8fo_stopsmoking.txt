Help me quit? I'm pretty addicted, I realize. When it comes to cigs I have the habits of a serious junky.

I bought Allen Carr's book (have not had time to read it yet). I have an app on my phone to begin counting down the awesomeness. I have an urge to quit. 

However, I have serious addiction habits. Like, when my pack is less than 1/2 full (even if I still have like 9 cigs), I have to drop what I'm doing and go to the store, or my mind will not be able to focus on what I'm doing. 

Focus is another problem. When I try to quit smoking, it's like I'm trying to read while I am tired: reading the same sentence 5 times and not getting it, forget what I was doing. Serious "senior moments". 

When I quit last time, it took a LOT of willpower, and I was right back at it the moment my pregnant sister got WAY to hormonal (She really was, we had to help her through postpartum depression too. She's cool now.) and threatened to "disown" me - basically she and her daughter would never see me. The details are stupid, and it didn't happen, but I smoked a whole pack and sobbed for 4 hours that night.

I had a decent time quitting with the patch, but the last time I tried the patch was a year ago and it make me short of breath. That scares me, so I won't try the patch or Chantix.

Please help. I am really quite impossible about this topic but I want to quit so badly. Can fellow redditors give me some tips on changing the habits of a serious addict? How can I overcome some of these problems and not fall behind on my master's or get in trouble at work for sitting there like a zombie? Ever since I fell back on the wagon, my willpower has been super weak. 

Edit: A super trustworthy person told me she quit no problem after hypnosis. Any thoughts? I'm not looking for an easy out, I'm just looking for a solution that works.

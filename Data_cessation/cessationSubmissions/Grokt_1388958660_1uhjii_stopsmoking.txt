Today I lost all hope (rant)

Hi, I'm smoking for 6 years now (a little bit less than a pack a day), had several breaks up to 2 months after realizing how bad I smell. I always told myself that I could if I wanted to. My newest lie to make myself feel better: I'll just buy an e-zigarette and blend it out nice and slowly.. well that got crushed pretty hard this week.

I got sick and in order to get well again, I needed to stop smoking for a few days, so i bought nicotine-Inhalators. After 3 days im sitting here writing this enjoying a delicious smoke (its rather dusgusting tbh). What the hell.. i cant even stop smoking with nicotine, with the oral stimulation... there is no real reason for me to do this right now, yet i couldn't stop myself.. :/

Anyone else experienced something like this, what was your solution'?

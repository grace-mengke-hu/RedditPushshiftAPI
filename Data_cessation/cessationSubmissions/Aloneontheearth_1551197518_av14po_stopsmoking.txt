Quitting Juul timeline

Hey everybody,

I am in the process of quitting using my Juul and am on day 3 without it! I used it to try to quit smoking cigarettes, but ended up vaping about a pod a day. My question is about how the withdrawals work. When I have tried to quit smoking in the past it was pretty terrible, but no where near as bad as the withdrawals from using the Juul. After 10 hours of not using it my body felt weak, my mind was foggy and worst of all I was so irritable I couldn't do anything without becoming furious. After looking at a timeline of nicotine withdrawal symptoms this seems a little early in the process to be happening. What was your experience like quitting the Juul? What were the withdrawals like?

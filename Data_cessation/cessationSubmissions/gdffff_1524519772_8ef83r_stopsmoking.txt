Weird lung microscratch whenever i think of smoking

I barely smoked - like 10 a day on average for a year, stopped smoking more than a year ago (0 cigarettes since then). Now once every 2-3 months whenever im in a business meeting with a person who smokes - this might just be my imagination but it feels like my lungs are trying to tell me to smoke by reminding me they exist and they need it, what the hell...

Is that normal or is my organism retarded?

Pre Day 5 Tingles

Almost day 5 for me! I mostly got here by getting extremely sick over the weekend. I couldn’t breath and couldn’t get out of bed (even though I wanted to smoke) so it just fell away..

This has been the worst day so far. I’m not longer sick. I feel like I’m on my usual day ones. My skin feels tingly.. earlier I did something that I can do in my sleep but I felt very clumsy. My mouth feels tingly my teeth are tingly. 
I think it’s been hard for my to discern craving from tingling because I’m associating everything together. If I smoked I wouldn’t feel this under currant 

I won’t smoke. I’m no longer a smoker. I don’t my whole life being planned around my next smoke. My last dollars being saved fiendishly to buy a pack before my next pay day. .
I just want to know if anyone else had these tingles and know what they are? I’ve been googling but I have had no luck so far.

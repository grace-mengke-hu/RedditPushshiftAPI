I quit 9 days ago and today I miss it like crazy. What is wrong with me?

Seriously, I miss it like crazy today. I thought it is all under control, but clearly I was wrong. I feel also similar to the first 3 days. I am 100% cold turkey. I find it really difficult to focus and I feel depressed. Any advice? Please, help...

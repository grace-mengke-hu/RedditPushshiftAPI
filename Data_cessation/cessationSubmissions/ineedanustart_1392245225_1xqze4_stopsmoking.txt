Lung capacity for running - Day 2

My name is "I need a nu start," because I quit in 2012, but didn't keep it up. I worked my ass off with Couch to 5k, but only got to week 5, my gym routine started to slip, and before I knew it was SMOKING AGAIN!

Ugh, horrible. I have a question though. When I started C25K I'd been quit for ~1 month. I tried Week 1 today and bit it just over half way through because of my lungs. I remember by Week 4, lungs weren't the issue, legs were, and by Week 5 although I could definitely feel the burn again in my lungs, I felt like it was not going to hold me back... 


I know that if I quit now, my lung capacity would stay the same without exercise... but I guess my question is for those who have quit and started running immediately, how long does it take before you get off that first plateau and start making progress? Should I try running again in 2 days, or hold off for a couple of weeks? I'm on Day 2.

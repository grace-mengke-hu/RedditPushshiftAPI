Today is day 7. I'm doing OK.

I tried Chantix, as soon as the first bad dream hit I got rid of em. That's not going to help me. Then I got a pack of herbal (no tobacco, no nicotine.) Hated those and now it's just me and my willpower. The cravings are here, but they haven't and won't break me. It's only gotta get easier from here, right?

I don't want one!

Been smoking again for 6 months after being quit for 4 years, previously.  Last time I quit with an e-cig, this time was cold turkey.  Really stressful day with the kids, just life in general.  Asked my husband if later he would go grab me a pack of smokes because I just can't cope right now.  He said sure.  And somewhere in the process of waiting for him to get around to it, I told him not to because I realized I don't even want one.  It doesn't sound good and I know it would just make me feel worse.  Wow...it feels great to actually FEEL that instead of just telling myself to feel it!

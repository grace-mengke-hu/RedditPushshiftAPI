Shortness of breath?? (just quit)

Today is day 5. Last night was horrible. I would start to fall asleep and my body would wake me up and I'd feel like I couldn't breathe. I'd have to take gasps to get air into my lungs. I feel short of breath here and there today as well...My nose is runny and I'm lethargic and unfocused.

Mother of god please tell me this all will pass. And does anyone have a remedy for the sleep issue I'm having?

Thanks!

Quitting is easy. Not starting again is hard.

For me it is easy to stop smoking. I throw away my last pack of cigarettes, I struggle for a day or two of nervousness, I start working out and in a week I can smell again and do not have to hide my bad breath from my SO. For me this is easy. I am used to quitting! The stress is not that big, and not smoking feels great.
But then, there is a party, or a camping trip, or a gig, or I meet my old friend, or I have an awful day at work and I ask for a cigarette, than another. Finally, not to be a burden, I buy my own pack, and it starts all over again.
I quit once again this Monday, and I really hope I will not start again.

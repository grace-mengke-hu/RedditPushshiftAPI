**This is the place to post about your upcoming journey on December 10th. What have you done to prepare? What is your plan? Do you have advice for the rest of us?**

I have been really reflecting on every single ciggy I smoke. It's snowing (when it feels like it) here, so when I go outside, I really try to think about why in the world I think this is an ok lifestyle. When I drive now, I have not been smoking and ask myself why I felt it was ok to ruin my car and health in spite of snow flying in?

I go to the gym and listen to my lungs. I think really hard about what they sound like and what I want them to sound like in a month. I have written down all of my stats and hope to improve.

Besides my mental toughness training, I haven't done much else. This is the time to compile links and ideas though, so bring them on.

How's everyone doing?

My local gas station cashier lady is inadvertently helping me quit smoking

I have been going to the same gas station for a few years now. Pretty much everyday or every other day I would stop to buy smokes. It’s usually the same lady working there and as soon as she sees me pull up, she’ll grab me a deck and have it waiting up at the till for me. I don’t know if this lady is losing it mentally (she’s actually super cool so I hope not) but lately, she wasn’t grabbing my kind. I’d get up there and it’d be some random weird brand and I’d have to correct her. Now I’m trying to quit, but I wanted to keep up the routine of stopping there, maybe just top up the tank, reward my good nonsmoking behaviour with a treat or something. So I made it into kind of a thing: I told her last time “nope don’t need them, actually, I’m quitting. But those aren’t the right ones anyway” and we had a laugh about it and then I joked “how bout if you get it wrong, I won’t buy them. It’ll be like a guessing game for you and I won’t buy any till you get it right!” It was just meant as a joke, but I’ve been back there probably 5-6 times and she’s got it wrong each time and it actually makes it easier for me to say no to them. I don’t know why, like I’m not saying no to the smokes but more to the game or something but it actually has been working! Who knows, maybe she’s not developing dementia and is intentionally trying to get me to not buy them, either way, not sure how it’ll be if she ever does show me my brand, but I will try to resist for sure!

tl;dr: crazy gas station lady keeps getting my brand wrong and I won’t buy any till she gets it right

Day 17- Last night I had a terrible nightmare- “ I was driving somewhere and had a bad day. I wanted to buy a pack of smokes and smoke it all. But I was struggling myself to not do that telling myself my day won’t get better with smoking. At the end I didn’t do it”. I’m so glad how my dream ended 😀

The Quit Smoking Journey

Hi guys,

I believe this will be my third solid attempt on quit smoking. I've been a smoker for the past 7 years.

This time as an extra motivation I decided to start a blog to write my progress as I go through. To help me commit to it more serious and to also try to motivate others to succeed.

Today was the day 1.

Feel free to check it out:

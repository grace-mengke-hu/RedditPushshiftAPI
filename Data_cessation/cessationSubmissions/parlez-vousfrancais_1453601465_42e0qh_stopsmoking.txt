32 days smoke free!

I quit cold turkey Dec. 22, 2015. I am beyond proud of myself and the benefits in just a month of not smoking are amazing. I feel 100x better and my confidence is through the roof. (Not to mention the money I've saved).

A HUGE thanks to this subreddit keeping me going throughout my first week. Thank you all for the kind words and motivation!

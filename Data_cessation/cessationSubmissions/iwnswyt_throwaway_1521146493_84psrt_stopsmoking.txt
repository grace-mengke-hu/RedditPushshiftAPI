I quit for 8 months

This is not meant for pitty or anything of the sort, just some extra motivation to someone struggling. I just found out my husband is cheating on me and soon ill be homeless. I got stressed out and smoked a few cigs, but guys my day is still shit and now I smell bad. Please stay strong cigs don't make anything better. You are better than this addiction. I'll be restarting my clock and I will not smoke with you today.

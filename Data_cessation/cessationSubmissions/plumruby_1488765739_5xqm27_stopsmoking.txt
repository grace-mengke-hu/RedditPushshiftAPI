One month and a bit in- smoking herbs

Hey!

So I quit cold turkey January 28th... I did steal some drags the first week of quitting, and then I had a panic attack last week where I bummed a cigarette while I was on vacation and it was a menthol. For the record I hate menthols but I smoked it anyway and felt pretty shit about it. 

I haven't been using any gum or patches or whatnot. 

I smoke socially mostly, and whenever I'm anxious. And I'm pretty prone to anxiety attacks. 

I cut down from smoking after breakfast/lunch a while ago, unless I'm hungover and then yes give me all the cigarettes. I could easily smoke a pack while drinking, as well as easily go a day without cigarettes after a bender. I would almost always have at least one cigarette after work with a beer.  

I roll my own cigarettes, and have found rolling smoking herbs to be super helpful. Still lets me get my break, and gives me something to do with my hands. Sure smoking anything isn't the best for you but it's certainly better than the nicotine addiction.

Right now I'm smoking a blend of catnip, lobelia, and mullein. When I broke down and smoked that menthol cigarette it's because I was on vacation in Mexico and didn't bring my herb blend with me given it didn't exactly look legal and I didn't want customs bugging me. I couldn't find any of these herbs on my week vacation so I did some googling and ended up smoking chamomile. Didn't crave another cigarette the rest of the vacation. Or since returning to the states.

The blend was recommended to me at a hippie sort of herb shop. The walls were lined with mason jars of different herbs, and some prerolled "cigarettes" were there to from a brand called Mountain Rose Herbs.

I've also been taking 5-HTP every night and L-Tyrosine every day. 

Honestly it's been super helpful. Would recommend :)

I did not even start yet and already feel tempted to buy another pack. Do you have any advice?

So I am not going to sugarcoat it. I need to stop smoking. The toll it has taken on my body and my wallet has been tremendous over the years. I am tired of coughing and wheezing and scraping together the last of my change just to buy another pack to get me through the day. 

Now the concept of quitting an addiction is nothing new to me. In fact, I am currently almost 45 days sober after about 3 miserable years of severe alcoholism, which I feel incredibly grateful for. It has not been easy but I have reached a point now where I do not miss drinking even a tiny bit. 

I heard that it is unwise to try and fight all of your demons at once, so for that time I basically focused on the deadliest of them all and stuck with smoking until now. 
I feel like I have reached the point now where I have had enough of it and can begin to tackle this other addiction that has been eating away at me over time. However this time I feel a lack of urgency to stop right now. That is the best way I can put it. It might sound weird but one thing that has helped me tremendously to stay off the booze was the immediate danger of the situation, which is simply not given with smoking. Smoking kills slowly and gradually, so in my subconsciousness there is no need to stop it just now. I currently have 2 cigarettes left, after which I planned to stop for good, but just a few hours ago I got the urge to just buy another pack for tonight and postpone all this for a few hours. I know this is absolute bullshit my addict brain is telling me just to keep me hooked. I have been through this and even a lot worse already, so there really is no logical reason for me to overthink this situation the way I do. Still, I can not seem to shake off the urge to buy just this one more pack. 

So basically I just needed to vent, but if you have any advice for me, I would be glad to hear it.

Thank you for reading :)

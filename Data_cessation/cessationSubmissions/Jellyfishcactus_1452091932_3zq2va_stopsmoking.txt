Any tips that may help?

Hey guys, I'm on day three of not smoking, I've tried to quit in the past but to no avail (I've been a heavy smoker for about 12 years now). For about the past four months I've been seeing a really awesome girl. She used to smoke and when we started dating she would smoke with me (she's the type who can start and stop whenever she wants) but about a month ago she stopped completely and expressed interest that I do so, so here I am. Any advice would be great because although I do enjoy it, I know its a disgusting, costly habit.

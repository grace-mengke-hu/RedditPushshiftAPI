Rookie question about nicotine addiction and health

My sister is trying to quit, but she said she still is going to light up now and then if she goes out drinking or whatever. And from what I remember learning, even if you just smoke sometimes, you’re still doing horrible damage and destroying the cilia in your larynx. 

Is it common to still have a smoke now-and-then? Is it even worth it if it’s still horrible for you?

I sit here with a wheeze.

I have smoked for 23 years. 

I have mild asthma. Feel like an idiot. 

Which based on the pervious few words you would be right in thinking and in total agreement with you would be anyone with any form of intelligence. 

I have 22 cigarettes and I am going to be a non smoker after the 22nd is stubbed in the sticking vessel beside me.

My plan if all you lovely people on this sub don't mind is I'm going to post when I need a cigarette to perhaps use the time I would smoke to say hi. In an attempt to fill the space where I would be smoking and hope take use of this great sub.

Good luck to you all and in 22 cigarettes time I won't be a smoker.

Big hugs.

:)

How to deal with the subconscious factor?

Hi, this is my first time at reddit, so bear with me. I'm 23 and I have been smoking for the past four or five years.

I picked it up as a habit to cope with my anxiety and breakup (yeah I know, stupid reason, but well).

Eventually down the road I quit for around 6 months but the trigger after that was me flunking my admission test. I got in, later on. However, I have been unable to curb the habit. Now, when I think of smoking.. its that extraordinary entity that makes me look cool. I am sorry but I cannot imagine a guy in a suit, not smoking. Its just there. The subconsciousness. I tried quitting before this post, but I could only make it as far as 38 hours before giving in. The headache was too strong and I was dizzy. I know I can kick the habit, but the problem is that I can't lose the coolness factor from my head. It sticks.

Sorry for the long post. Would appreciate any help.

Cheers.

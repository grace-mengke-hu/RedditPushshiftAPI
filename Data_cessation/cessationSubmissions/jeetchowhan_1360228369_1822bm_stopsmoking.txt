Smoke away your worries, not your lungs!

There are tiny hairs all along your respiratory tract called Cilia. They sway like the waves catching all kinds of bacteria, dust and viruses every time you inhale. When you smoke, you paralyse these Cilia. They lose their inability to filter out all airborne dangerous bacteria and viruses. That is why smokers suffer from constant flus, colds and throat infections. Within less than a month of quitting smoking, these Cilia are activated again.

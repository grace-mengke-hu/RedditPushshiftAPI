I quit smoking 6.5 years ago. Going to Cuba soon and very tempted...

A little bit of history. Had my first puff at 13 (1993), bought my daily pack from 16 (1996) to 31 (2011).

In my first attempts to quit, I really wanted to become a social smoker. I know a lot of people who quit and now smoke once or twice a year in special occasions.

First attempt in 2007. Quit for 9 months, then decided I'll get a puff from a friend while on holidays abroad. Bought a pack two days later.

Second attempt in 2008. Quit for 6 months. Same as first time.

After this, I realized I was an addict and could never smoke just for pleasure. So my next attempt in 2011 was the last one. I knew a single puff would bring me back.

It's been now 6.5 years, and I still want a cigarette every once in a while. At least once a month, I'll wake up in sweats and panicked because I just fell back in the habit in a nightmare...

And now I'm going to Cuba. And I'm thinking that I can't go there and not smoke a Cuban cigar... And you don't even inhale cigar after all... But it's a slippery slope... And I'm traveling with a smoker, so cigarettes will be easily accessible... But it's been more than 6 years, I should be able to take it... I don't know...

And I genuinely have no idea why I am writing this......

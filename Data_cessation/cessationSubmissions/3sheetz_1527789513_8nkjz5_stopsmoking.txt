Quitting soon. Gonna try patches. Dose suggestion?

I'm getting oral surgery done and can't smoke or drink so I'm not gonna be a pleasant person. For any of you who have used the patches, Nicoderm for instance, what dose would you recommend for a pack a day smoker? I've heard 21mg can be too much. I guess I could get 14mg and 7mg and put on a 7 if if 14 is too much.

Suggestions? Thank you all.

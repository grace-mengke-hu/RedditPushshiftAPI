I just lit a sigaret and had two puffs, after not smoking for plus 10 years

I don't even remember when I quit. It was ages ago it seems. I don't count, haven't counted since long. I don't like to admit it but I'm stressed, circumstances and shit. I have been stressed before without temptation, but tonight, my husband, who smokes, went to bed early and after, I lit one of his sigaretes and had two puffs. I did not like it. My mouth tastes bad. I did not finish the sigaret. I don't understand why I did it. Is this what stess does?

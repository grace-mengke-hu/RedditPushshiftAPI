Currently smoking my last cigarette (hopefully)!

I'm tired of smoking. I've been doing it for over 10 years now and I'm ready to quit. 

My girlfriend and I aren't drinking for a week. Drinking is usually my trigger so I figure why not now? 

I guess I'm just looking for encouragement and suggestions. I don't want to do an ecig or gum or patches. Just natural assistance. Might as well clean up right ya know? Thoughts? I appreciate anything I can get I guess.

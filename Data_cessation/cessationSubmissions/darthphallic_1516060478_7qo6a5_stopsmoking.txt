Question regarding quitting

Haven’t smoked since like Saturday morning and boy is this awful. I’ve been able to avoid caving with relative ease so far but here’s my question. I work in the beer / bar industry where cigarettes are near unavoidable. If I cave and have one over the coming weekend will it put me back to square one with withdrawals?

convincing someone else to quit.

Hi guys, i dont know if this question is in the wrong place but its been on my mind for quite some time and this was the only place i could found that could accurately help me.


So recently i have been snooping around my mothers smoking and i was shocked when i saw that she smoked almost 2 packs a day. Normally i would stay out of my mothers affairs especially on this particular subject. 

But i am very concerned about my mothers health, i love my mom to death and it would kill me to lose her to lung cancer or other smoke related diseases. She also has asthma so that doesnt make the situation better

However whenever i approach the subject she snaps at me and tells me that its none of my business. I suppose that is right, but i guess what my question is. 
In what way can i approach the subject in a manner that would not provoke an overreaction?

I dont know if im just being selfish but my mother is the only family i have. and as mentioned earlier i would hate to lose her.

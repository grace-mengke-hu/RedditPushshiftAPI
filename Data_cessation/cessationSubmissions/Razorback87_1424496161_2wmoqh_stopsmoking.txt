Stinky Clothes Realiation

Today is the 3rd day cig free and it sucks! However when I was changing in the gym locker room, I noticed that my clothes had a terrible smoke odor. They had been worn a few days earlier before I quit. Just smelling my clothes and being disgusted how bad they smell (to me and non-smokers) gave me more of a reason to stay determined and stay on the right path.

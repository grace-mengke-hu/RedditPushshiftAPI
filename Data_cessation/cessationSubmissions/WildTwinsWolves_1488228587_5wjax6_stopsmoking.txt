March 20th is my quitting day. Extremely nervous

Like other people this my 50th time trying but this time HAS to be different. I want to quit so bad... I just realized I've been smoking for 10 years now and don't want to go any longer. My habit bothers my family and now my recent girlfriend. They are going to help me quit as well. I'm going to start working out and eating healthier as of now to keep my mind off it. I use to read a lot so I will be picking that up as well. I picked March 20th because my Dad (who use to smoke for 20 plus years who recently quit) mentioned to me that I try these pills for quitting. I don't recall what their called but I've tried them before when I attempted to quit and they work for me too, just my head wasn't in it last time I tried. I'm about 15-17 cigs a day, so today I'll only smoke 10 and go down from there each day or week depending on how I feel until March 20th has arrived. The best I've ever done is 5 smokes a day, I've never been able to quit completely in 10 years which is just sad to me... The time is now and I know it's going to be fucking hell...

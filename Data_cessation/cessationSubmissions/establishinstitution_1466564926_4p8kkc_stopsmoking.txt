Tried quitting last week for the first time

Smoked for the last 4 years.. never a heavy smoker but usually 9 cigarettes a day. Started cutting down went four a day for a week then three a day for 3 days and two for 1 day and one for 1 day. Had my last smoke Friday at 7am. Not gonna lie it is a lot easier then I thought.. not to discredit anyone because I have tried before and lost my mind. Not sure what's different this time but I haven't had any cravings worth noting and haven't really had any withdrawal symptoms except constant headaches. Anyways this subreddit has been a gigantic help reading so many motivational stories

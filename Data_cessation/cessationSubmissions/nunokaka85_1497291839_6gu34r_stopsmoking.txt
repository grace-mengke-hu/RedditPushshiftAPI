Tried quitting smoking alot, but today is the day

Hey guys, first time here. I am 21 years old but been smoking since I was 13. I've tried alot of times to quit, but I believe today is the day. I smoke about a pack a day (it costs 3.30â‚¬), but from 2 weeks ago I have smoked about only 7/8 cigarettes a day. ive tried alan carrs book and audiobook but it didnt really work, but I will stop this bad habit. Why is today the last day? Last cigarette of the pack, and tomorrow is payday (lol). Wish me luck guys

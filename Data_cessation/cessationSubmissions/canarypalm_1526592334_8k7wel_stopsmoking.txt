Anybody else find work was the big hurdle?

I'm about to be 39, have been smoking for about 20 years, and the weirdest thing is: When I am not at work, or have gone home for the night, zero cigarettes. I don't even really want them.

But the fact that every day I'm coming at my job in such a state of stress that I feel the need to get a pack ... I'm wondering if something as drastic as a career change might be in order.

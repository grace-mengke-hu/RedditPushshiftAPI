First real challenge to my resolve...

Just over 5 days so far. It's been manageable overall, not as bad as I thought (thanks Allen Carr). Me and the girlfriend are in the middle of a fairly serious fight right now, which is absolutely a major trigger for me, but I'm doing ok. Cravings are pretty bad, but I'm not really giving serious thought to smoking. It's like, I've accepted cravings for what they are, and know that they can't force me to do anything I don't want to do. They're just uncomfortable, and I know that if I act on them I'll still feel angry, the fight will still be happening, but I'll also feel like shit for letting myself down.

I'm sure I'll feed proud of myself tomorrow, for now I just have to get past this stupid argument! Thanks guys.

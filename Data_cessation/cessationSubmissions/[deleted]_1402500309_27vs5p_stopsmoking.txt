40 Days. This subreddit as become my diary of sorts.

It's been 40 days since I last had a cigarette. Yesterday, while cleaning, I found 3 empty packs in my closet. I opened them and smelled the remnants of a life long gone. I am not sure why this last week or so has been such a struggle. I know deep down that smoking is not going to make the recent stress disappear. I really just want to run or cry or run while crying. I want to defeat this devil that has attached himself to me, whispering in my ear to "just have one". Go away little devil. I do not want you here. As the wonderful Florence Welch would say..."It's hard to dance with the devil on your back, so shake him off" and "It's always darkest before the dawn".

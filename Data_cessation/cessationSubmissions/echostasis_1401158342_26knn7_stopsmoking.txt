I quit for real this time.

I've been a smoker for about 3 years (since I was 16), and over the past few days my asthma has been kicking my ass, and giving me lung pain whenever I smoked.

I don't have the money, I don't have the lungs, so why bother with those little shits anymore? The last time I quit I made it for about 2 weeks, but this time I'm more serious, and I'm reaching out to you r/stopsmoking for support during these hard times ahead.

So far I've been smoke free for 24 hours, it may not be a long time, but I'm pretty proud if myself for ignoring the cravings all day.

I've heard good things about Allen Carr's book, and I'm thinking of reading that since so many people said it helped them. (If anyone has the free pdf for download I will be forever grateful)

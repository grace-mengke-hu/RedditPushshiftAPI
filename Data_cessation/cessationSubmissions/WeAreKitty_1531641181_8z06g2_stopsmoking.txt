One Day, 18 hours

So I’m almost at the 48 hour mark.

All planned that back to the Monday-Friday 9-5 tomorrow I don’t take my purse out the house just a small amount of emergency funds, gym bag ready for every lunch at work so I improve my health and can’t smoke, etc. So I’ve got the plan and motivation there - had a health scare recently and it’s shaken me right up to do this.

Only problem is I’ve been coughing non stop, have headaches and dizziness, my gums ache and (sorry for the gross info) sweating like crazy.  I want to do this cold turkey as I can’t see the point replacing nicotine with nicotine or one addiction for another. I have no intention on going back to 20 a day at all, ever. Ever ever. (She says for the hundredth time)

Any pointers and help to get through these horrible withdrawal symptoms appreciated - cold and flu tablets don’t seem to be helping at all and feel like I could sleep for days!

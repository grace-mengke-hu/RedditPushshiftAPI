Smoked my last

I have been a social smoker for about 5 years. I never considered myself addicted, but when I would be out with friends I would smoke with them. In November my grandfather passed away and I fell into a deep depression that escalated my "casual" habit to the point that I was smoking a pack a day most days. I don't like how expensive smoking is, but it helped me to feel better during my depression. I have wanted to quit for about a month, but the motivation was still not in me. I have recently started going to the gym with a couple of friends and I am seeing the toll smoking has done to my body. I know it will not be an easy road, but I feel that I need to do it. Any advice is welcome as I can already feel a craving and it has been about 20 minutes since I have decided that enough is enough.

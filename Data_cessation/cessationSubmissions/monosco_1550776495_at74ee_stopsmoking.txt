Missed my year, because I don't think about it

The best thing about having smoking in the rearview mirror is how infrequently I think about it now, compared to the massive brain space it used to constantly consume. I was thinking about it today and realized I was in the neighborhood of a year out - turns out that my quit date was back on February 9th.

Here's to thinking about smoking as little as possible!

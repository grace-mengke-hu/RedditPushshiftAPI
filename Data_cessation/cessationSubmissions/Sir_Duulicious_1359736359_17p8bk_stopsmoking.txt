Made it my first full week without smoking in a couple years AND pass the ultimate test!!

So last night I went to a concert with my girlfriend, buddy, and his girl. Well his girl is 21, me and my buddy 18, and my girlfriend 19. Anyways, the 21 buys us all a couple beers... $8.50 a pop fucking ridiculous.

Well the guy next to me starts sharing his beer with me and I end up drinking way more than I should of. Anyways I'm shit face and beyond coherent thinking. 

I really WANTED to smoke smoke but I DIDN'T! No matter how I rationalized it, I came up with a reason not to! 

If I can say no to a smoke when drunk I can say no anytime! Fuck yeah. One week!

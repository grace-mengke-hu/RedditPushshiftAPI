5th time's the charm?

Hey fellow nonsmokers! I'm a 25yo artist chiming in from NYC! My birthday was a few days ago, and I feel like the best present I can give myself is to have smoked my last cigarette this morning!!  There was even one cigarette left in my pack that I THREW AWAY! I've smoked for 10 years, and this is my 5th opportunity to quit cold turkey. Each hiatus has only lasted 3mo max, but I look forward to this new chapter. It's not very chilly here yet, which is always a huge deterrent to light up. I believe my financial instability as of late can deter me just as well, haha. I keep hearing Ewan McGregor's voice from Trainspotting in my mind, urging me to "Choose Life!" Thanks for your support!

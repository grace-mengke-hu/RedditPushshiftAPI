Hi guys, I smoked a cigarette on day 90, but I never reset...question.

So I am on day 80 of no cigarette, but I have only had 1 cigarette in 170. My question is, did that one cigarette ruin my progress? and should I reset to day 80?

I'm I really on day 80 or 170? I know this is a stupid question, but I just wanted to know what you guys thought. Thanks.

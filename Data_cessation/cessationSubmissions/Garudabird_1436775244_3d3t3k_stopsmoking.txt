Time to be honest with myself

I have been smoking for over 20 years with occasional quit attempts, the longest one being a year.  I quit again 12 days ago...except I lapsed for a day.  I've been trying to ignore that day and write it off as a slip up but realised that I really am only kidding myself.  My quit date is not 12 days ago but the day after my lapse so I have reset my date and my badge and feeling pretty positive, now that I am being honest with myself.  I was reading some other posts this morning and the one that really got me was the one that said 'I never want to see the day 1 badge again'. I really don't either.  I'm new to this site but finding lots of motivation from others' stories so I guess I'm going to be a regular visitor for a while.

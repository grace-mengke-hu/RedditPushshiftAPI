Nicotine patch getting hot?

What the hell. I've used probably 50 of these patches in my life and this has never happened. I can't find anything on Google either. 

Usually I put it on and in about 5 mins it gets really itchy and then goes away in a couple mins. This time I put it on and instead of itchy it got really warm like one of those chemical heat pads that you use for back pain. It actually feels hot to the touch. I almost ripped it off because it felt like if it got any hotter it would actually start burning my skin. 

Has this happened to anyone else? I'm at almost 72 hours by the way and I haven't killed anyone yet!

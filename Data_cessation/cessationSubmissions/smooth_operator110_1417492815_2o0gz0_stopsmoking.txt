Nice to meet you! Here's how I did it - and a question as well.

Nice to meet you all!

I quit smoking on 11/13 with my best friend and his girlfriend. My boyfriend doesn't smoke, so he's been really happy about the whole thing - major credit to him for not pushing me to do it before I was ready, but being completely supportive.

Only one thing seems to have worked for me, and my post here may seem to negate that...but it's worth it if it helps you.

**I just ignore it.**

I know, I know - it sounds stupid. But I mean it. I willfully and completely ignore everything and anything having to do with smoking. My friend and I work together from my home and we never go outside anymore. We completely altered our routine and never think about what it used to be like - we just fool ourselves in to accepting that it's *always* been this way. Whenever I get that feeling, that "what's missing? Oh yeah, I know what's missing..." feeling, I immediately tell myself that I know what's missing - ice cream! Brushing my teeth! I forgot to set my alarm! I need to take my medication! I forgot to wash the dishes! And my mind just seems to...accept it somehow. As long as I'm quick enough.

It's not perfect, but I will tell you that this time around I have negated 90% of the cravings that I put up with last time I quit. I feel like a totally different person. My boyfriend has been hugely helpful by never mentioning it - he has only brought it up once and it was already slightly on topic, and all he did was tell me that he's really proud of me. Then he changed the topic. He's been fantastic at distracting me. I didn't specifically ask him to, he seems to be psychic, but if you're going to try this method I would definitely enlist of the help of anyone around you beforehand.

Coming here and talking about it will probably make this evening difficult in comparison, but that's why I did it right before bed. Speaking of bed, this time around? Only two dreams about smoking so far, and neither of them were too awful.

I don't know if it might help anyone else here, but if it does I am so glad that I shared.



My question: Since I quit smoking I've had a serious problem - tonsillitis. I had strep, then tonsillitis **twice** since I quit. Has anyone else had this happen? I would love ANY advice you have to offer.

Thank you and good luck to all of you!

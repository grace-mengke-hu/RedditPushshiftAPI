Trying and failing

I've been trying to gather the mental strength to quit smoking. This morning on the way to work, I grabbed my pack and crumpled it thinking "Today is the day". Not even 4 hours into my day I've gone to my vehicle found the crumpled pack and smoked the pathetic looking survivor. I feel weak and frustrated that the best I could do was 3 hours, I want to quit for my health. I've recently become engaged and have been thinking that I want to live a full long life and the first step is to quit smoking and instead I last a sad 3 hours. For those of you that have been able to stop, I salute you. I'm not sure what to do.

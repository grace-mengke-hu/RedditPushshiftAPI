When do these headaches (and twitches) ease up?

Or the twitching. God, the twitching. 

The headaches have been getting a little worse over the last couple days though, I was kind of hoping they'd bugger off by now. Does anything help get rid of them or ease them? I've been drinking lots of water and tea thinking maybe I was a bit dehydrated but it doesn't seem to do much. I've taken some ibuprofen here and there but it doesn't last long.

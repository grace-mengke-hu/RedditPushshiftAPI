Day 1 again and a few questions

Hey guys,

it's my day 1 again after relapsing on day 3 on Sunday last weekend. 

Any advice for dealing with being incredibly grumpy/irritable? There are periods of time that feel like forever where I really feel like I could go into a fit of rage. Eventually it passes but is there anything you could recommend for getting myself through these periods?

Are the first 3 days the hardest? Does it get easier after that? 

Thanks guys!

5 years, friends.

In the first few days it seemed impossible, first months it seemed unlikely, and after the first year it seemed entirely feasible. So I'm here, at 5 years since I became a non-smoker. Here are the four things that helped me get here:

* I was absolutely, completely, sick of smoking. If you had offered me a punch in the face, instead of having to go get a pack of cigarettes, I would have taken the punch. I was sick of all the mental, physical, and behavioral resources that smoking was taking. I hated having to worry if I had enough for work, if I had enough to make it through the rest of the night, etc. I just hated it all.

* I read a book. The Easy Way, by Allen Carr. This was not my first approach- the first 3 days I used a patch but still had several cigarettes, which is stupid and a bit dangerous. I told myself I had to be neurotic and bitchy, so I was. It sucked. On Day 4, I read The Easy Way in one sitting, let it beat my over the head of the realities that *smoking is an addiction, and an addiction is not a part of you*. I can't kill or remove a part of myself. But addiction isn't a part of me, and I realized I could take it down. 

* I discovered and fixed my own problems. I realized smoking was a way to step off of reality for a while, to ignore the things that made me feel anxious or scared. I had some serious anxiety issues for a while, because I had never learned to handle them. I finally faced that problem and began to learn how to deal with stress by working through it, instead of ignoring it by smoking. Taking a time out from the world doesn't fix your problems, it doesn't even numb you to them. So I found new ways to handle things. 

* This is a bit silly, but I visualized the killing of my addiction. I decided to picture a nasty ugly troll in my head. Every time I craved a cig, the troll qwas moving and angry and demanding to be fed. Every time I resisted and said no, it died and got weaker. Finally after a few months, it was dead enough to be laying on the ground, limp and sweaty and groaning pathetically. But it's got one eye open, hopeful. I know if I give in to a cigarette, it will come roaring back to life. I like seeing that bastard suffer, so I deny it every chance I can. 

So that's what worked, folks. 5 years in and I still get a whiff of a smoke and think how nice it would be, but I also think about all the hard word, all the ways my life has changed, all the time and resources I have now that I'm not chained to an ashtray. It's all so worth it, quitting opened me up to so many new things and I contribute it 100% to the better, more interested person I am. I'm way more interested than I ever was with a cigarette. 

You can do this. You don't *need* cigarettes, the addiction does. And your addiction doesn't deserve anything. I did it, you guys are doing it. Keep it going.

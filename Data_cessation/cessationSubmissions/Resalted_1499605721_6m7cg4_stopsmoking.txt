1 Year smoke free, and I forgot about it.

I am smoke free for over a year now, and I forgot about the day :D
First I want to say thank you to you all! The positive feedback really helped!
Second I want to tell all of you, who are struggeling, it will get easier!
So easy infact that you don't think about smoking at all for 99% of the time. I atleast don't. Maybe you'll need longer than me, but you will get there! Just remember that you don't smoke when you feel the urge!

TL;DR Allen Carr's Book

I'm a grad student. As such, I really don't have much time for casual reading. When I am reading, it's always stuff pertaining to school. I know I should read the book and I'm really going to try. In the meantime though, would someone mind summarizing the main points from Allen Carr's book?

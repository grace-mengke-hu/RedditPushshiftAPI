Is vaping quitting ?

Hi guys, 

Last week I started vaping and completly cut out cigarettes. Vaping everytime i have a desire to smoke did help me forget about cigarettes so you can imagine i didn't really experience a real craving. Till 3 days later. I don't feel like I'm packing in, i don't get more hungry, I get a little shaky and pissed off If I don't vape for 3-4hours.. So im I accomplishing something or just playing a silly limited game.. I bought a 10pack without much debate with myself and not Im chocking on it as I was 3 days ago.. don't know if I can even get back on vaping..

All I dream about is being a non smoker, for years now, but I'm so weak, crushed and feeling so down.. help me.

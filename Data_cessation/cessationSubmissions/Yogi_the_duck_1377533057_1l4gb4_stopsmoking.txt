Allan Carr

So I just picked up Allan Carr's book because yet again, I couldn't make it through the weekend. I was driving home last night and threw my pack of smokes out the window, swearing off for good! Right? *right?* Well, I'm starting to read Allan Carr's book and it says not to stop smoking until you are finished with the book. I'm not going to lie; I'm pretty fuckin' skeptical at this junction. Anyone else have this feeling or does anyone that has read his book have any advice?

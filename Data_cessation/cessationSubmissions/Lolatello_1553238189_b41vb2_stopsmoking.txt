Last time I'll try to stop

because I want to succeed.
Reading all of your posts times to times makes me realize that it's ok to fail sometimes. You gave me the strength to stop this morning while I tough 'why not stop now'.

Some questions : how do you fill the gap? Last times, I took weight, tend to eat more. Did chewing nicotine help you?

Thought I would but I didnâ€™t

So itâ€™s been 1 month and 27 days since my last cigarette. I thought for sure I would relapse when my 12yo needed to have his tonsils and adenoids removed. I DID NOT! Iâ€™m pretty damn proud of myself for that. My husband told me later in the evening once we were home and had the kid settled that he was proud of me and knew I could do it. I wasnâ€™t so sure there for a bit. ðŸ˜®

should i smoke this... of course not

Will I ....? Ha... ?  All day i try to manage risk, financially, and generally speaking, insured up the ying yang, ... and here I am taking a HUGE RISK that is guaranteed almost to be disastrous... I don't recall any stories of yeah that lucky guy who was able to smoke the finest right up until he got hit by the train... lol.. You know what scares the living crap out of me is that I've now been educated to know that smoking coagulates the blood... holy cow... so no wonder my doctor tell me I have a 50% chance of suddenly grasping at my chest within  the next few years ...  Help?

How can I help my underage friend quit? I don't want to support her addiction :/

My friend is 17 and has been addicted to nicotine for 2 years now. She relies on others to get her juul pods because she's underage. Everyone in our friend group is sick of it. We don't want to support her addiction but if we don't help her get pods, she turns into a monster and ruins everyone else's fun.

She'll get money from her parents and sit out on our plans just to save the money. She wont eat a thing when we go out to eat and spend the money on juul pods. 

And she nags us to go buy juul pods for her until we give in. I personally don't buy her pods, but a 19 year old friend of ours does. She makse us go out of our way to the gas station that sells them the cheapest. Sometimes I wonder if she only wants to hang out with us so we'll buy her pods. A lot of our plans are made with "only if you buy me pods". 

It's ruining the dynamic in our friend group, I dont know what to do to help her. I feel terrible that something is controlling her life like it does. And she's so young, I hate to see this happen to her. 

What can I do to help?

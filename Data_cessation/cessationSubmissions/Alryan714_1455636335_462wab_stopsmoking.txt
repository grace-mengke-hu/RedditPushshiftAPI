8 month check in

4 months till I hit a year and I am beyond excited! I am though fighting a really bad cold at the moment. I walked by someone the other day smoking and I almost died. I am so happy I am not smoking and also sick. I don't miss those days what so ever! Hope everyone is staying strong! We got this shit!

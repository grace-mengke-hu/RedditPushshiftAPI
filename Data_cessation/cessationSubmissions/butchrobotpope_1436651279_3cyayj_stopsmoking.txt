Anniversaries and milestones

I came here to shamelessly brag and to say **thank you**. Check that flair: 1111 days. It seems impossible, yet here I am. A few days ago, when I hit 3 years, I was pleased. But '1111' is a special, lucky number for me: "Make a wish!"  

Part of what keeps me motivated are those stupid, little milestones. I don't know why. My next big one will be Day 1234. And after that, it's a short trip to Day 1460 (Year 4). I try to treat myself, to acknowledge that I have *actually* done something good.  

The difference between Day 1 and Day 1111 is strange. I faced a lot of challenges and temptations. I was convinced that I would fail, just like I had a dozen times before. Once I made it past Day 5, the worst was history. At 2 months - while I was drunk - a beautiful woman handed me a lit cigarette and told me to take a drag, just to fuck with me and check my head. After that night, I *knew* that I was in the clear. And yet, I find myself uncertain from time-to-time. That's one of the reasons I keep coming back here. I'll probably keep coming back, whenever I need some backup.  

So, thank you, r/stopsmoking. The support and resources I've found here have been amazing. I'm sure I couldn't have done it without you. Cheers!

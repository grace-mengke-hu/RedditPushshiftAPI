37 Days in and constantly angry

Title basically says it all.

 I quit smoking last month mostly because I wanted to try and save some money that I usually spend on Cigarettes. I'm at the point now where I am starting to feel a bit better health wise, but I've noticed the last week or 2 that I've just been really angry constantly at almost everything. 

This wasn't really a problem before, in fact, I hadn't really suffered from any noticeable withdrawal symptoms besides hunger maybe. The first couple weeks went pretty easily besides the occasional craving seeing my brother smoke, but now I feel like I'm just always mad. I'm sure 37 days is too long for it to be a withdrawal symptom, but I'm not sure what else it could be. My life has been, especially as of recently pretty non-stressful. I don't really have anything to be angry about and I can't really rationalize any of the things I have been getting pissed off about, but I notice it later on and have just been confused about it. 

Has anyone else experienced this? Does anyone have any advice?
Am I just angry and it has nothing to with quitting?

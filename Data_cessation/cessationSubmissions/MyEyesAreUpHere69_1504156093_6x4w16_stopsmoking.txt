Today is my Day 1

Today is my day 1 of getting rid of this burden. I travel a lot for my job so smoking helps me feel at ease while being alone for so long. My mom was a smoker for 40 years, had cancer and survived and then finally quit. 

I spend 30 dollars a week on smokes. I have set up a reoccurring transfer from my checking account for every Friday for that amount to go into my savings. I’ll be able to buy my new guitar in no time. Here’s to the new found wealth and better workouts.

Please help! : 1 month 3 days

It has been a really easy one first month . Hardly any cravings..
But now I would really want to smoke one. But not necessarily right at this moment.. Like celebrate-smoking..
I do not want to be a smoker again but it's killing me to say "I will never smoke again " ..
I found something beautiful when I smoked .. At certain times of course.. It was a little bit like the world stood still and I could think.. And now I think so much .. 
Like I don't get that break at all to just shut everything out .. 
I don't know what to do ..
A part of me want to smoke one damn cigarette .. And a part of me knows I have to start over if I do ..

I can't seem to remember for who I quit.. Okay it started because the money .. And for me .. But not sure if that motivates me at all anymore .. I don't know why I don't run to the store and buy cigarettes .. Okay they won't taste that good anyway but I don't really seem to care at all anymore .. If I relapse or don't .. What should I do?????

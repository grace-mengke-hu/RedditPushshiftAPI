2 months on January 11th after 20+ years as a smoker!

I decided to finally give them up on November 11th as my oldest son was figuring out my sneaky trips out the back door. I used Nicoderm patches for about 3 weeks and was able to just stop them with no real effect other than a few moody days. I have been doing real well but for some reason have had some evening urges this week. I'm trying now to quit snacking and to cut back on the wine and I have left a void. I have tried chewing gum but doesn't help much and would love any suggestions.

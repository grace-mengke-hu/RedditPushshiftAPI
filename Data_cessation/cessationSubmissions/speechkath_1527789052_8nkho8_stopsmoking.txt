It is funny- (my thoughts this morning)

I took this week off work to quit.  My husband lost his job a few months ago and he started a new one a couple of weeks ago.  Smoking increased more, of course.  We will have good insurance again in July (Cobra sucks btw- $$$$$).  With his new plan you get a free quit smoking program with counseling and free NRT etc.  He doesn’t smoke, but is very supportive of my quitting so he sent me the info last week.  Of course the first thing I thought was July- I wouldn’t have to deal with this until July!  FREEBEE DELAY!  And there are some stressors right now, maybe July would be a better time...  

But then I thought, maybe July will be crazier and I am going to the beach - do I want to be twitching 24 hours a day on a trip- how successful will I be?  So my take away was this- I made a plan and I’m doing it.  I can’t start this off breaking the first promise to myself.

If you wait for the perfect time, you will never start.

If I can make it through this, so can you!

Between the near break-up I had with my boyfriend to the now cancer diagnosis received for our dog I still haven't picked up a cigarette!!

This isn't a brag but if I can do it at only 19 days, so can you! It gets easier every time you resist. Life crap is going to keep happening and cigarettes aren't going to help make any of it any less awful.

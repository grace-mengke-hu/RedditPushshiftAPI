Apropos of nothing, but...

...I was reading the Wikipedia article on Robert Downey Jr. He discussed his recovery from addiction like this, and I felt it summed up overcoming something like drugs or alcohol or cigarettes. I think we can focus too much on the withdrawals when actually following through on deciding to quit might be the hardest part of all. Thoughts?

"You can reach out for help in kind of a half-assed way and you'll get it and you won't take advantage of it. It's not that difficult to overcome these seemingly ghastly problems ... what's hard is to decide to do it."

Keep going everyone!

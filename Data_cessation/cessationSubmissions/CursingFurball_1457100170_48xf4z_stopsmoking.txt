Just got through a withdrawal cycle

I just stopped smoking for about five days and had gone through a withdrawal. I honestly thought I had the flu or something, headaches, soreness in my body, constant coughing and sneezing. Yesterday was the worst, I couldn't go to any of my classes because I felt so bad. Today I feel a little better but I know that this won't be the last of my withdrawals. Any advice on how to deal with it if those symptoms come back?

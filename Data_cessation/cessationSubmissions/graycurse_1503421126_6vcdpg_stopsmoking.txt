Need some quick advice - day 4, trouble at work.

Hello all!

I've been lurking in this sub as I've prepared for and progressed into the world of being a non-smoker (it's been 11years!). I've been doing great! Cravings haven't been too bad, and haven't wanted a smoke even.

I'm in a predicament today, though. I'm leading development on a massive, highly visible project at work, leading a team and directing architecture (software) for another few projects, and advising 80 people on best-practices for my area of expertise. The stress isn't getting to me, but the mental fog is. I'm incapable of thinking straight right now, and thinking clearly/planning is my job. 

I need to finish up this project, and I really can't think clearly. It's taking me hours to do tasks that would normally take minutes. I'd typically accept this and move past it, but this project will be presented to 10k+ people tomorrow. Should I have a cigarette to clear the mental fog and knock out this work? I don't want one, but I don't think it's possible to get this done before the deadline otherwise. I'm also leaving for a 2-week vacation tomorrow, so I'm certain that I wouldn't be tempted to cave again

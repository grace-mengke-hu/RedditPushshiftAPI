approx. 11 months and just over it...

A bit of a rant coming up... it's been around 11 months since I stopped smoking, and the novelty has definitely worn off. My initial enthusiasm is now gone - my new healthy routine is now just a routine. My skin is no better than it was when I smoked. I think I've forgotten how shit I felt as a smoker. I recently went on a solo trip and when having a relaxing drink alone, I thought of how nice it would be to sit there with a cigarette.

Cigarettes have started to smell appealing again. As crazy as it sounds, I miss having something to look forward to throughout the day, even if it is essentially an addiction.

Being a non-smoker feels very 2018.

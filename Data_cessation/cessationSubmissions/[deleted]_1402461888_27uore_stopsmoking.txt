Today I quit smoking, this is my contract!

Today, I'm quitting smoking. I've told myself this for months, on several occasions, but thought that putting it down here in words, with you to see, would help me feel accountable.

Today, I'm stopping. I've only smoked for two years. At first it was casual, frivolous, something I did with the smokers I dated. I never identified as a smoker, just someone who smoked. Now, I'm a full pack a day, without those partners who smoked (who've since quit), and I'm the smoker.

Today, I won't be the stinky one at work anymore!

Today, I'm reminded about what a fool I've been. I'm not down with shaming at all, but I'm thinking about all of the education I was forced as a kid, everything I know about how ridiculously damaging it is, and remember that. My ten year old self is shaking her head.

You know what really helped me quit? Thinking about how arbitrary it all is. My dad does a funny thing, where he dissolves any situation down into its simplest. For example, people dancing at a bar: "there are these soundwaves, coming out of cabinets; people's eardrums process them, their brains recognize them, and then they wiggle their arms and legs in response - how fucked is that?" - I had this moment at the store, buying smokes. Seriously, you're buying a paper cylinder, full of leaves, to light it on fire and inhale it slowly... isn't that silly?

TL;DR: making a conscious, intense effort, after many of the same, and seeing this post as my contract to myself. And my lungs. Yours eyes mean I can't go back - thanks in advance!

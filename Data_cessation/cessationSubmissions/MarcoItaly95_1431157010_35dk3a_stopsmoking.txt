I had a bad day

Yesterday I had a bad day. I did an important test in university and I did not pass it just for a stupid mistake.
I was so depressed and I wandered for the whole university until a friend, a very pretty girl (who I would like to sleep with, to be honest :P) asked to go with her smoking.
At night, I went out with another friend for a drink and we had multiple.

And... despite alcohol and my bad day, I did NOT smoke. I went with the girl but I told her that I'm on day 19 and she esteems me a lot.
She tried to offer me one, but I told her "Elena, I quit smoking. No one more puff".
Same at night.

Now I'm on day 20. That's incredible but so good. Also feeling the estime of smokers as I quitted while they didn't is fantastic.

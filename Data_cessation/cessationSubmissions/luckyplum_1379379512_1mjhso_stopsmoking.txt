To all the lurkers of this subreddit

We are here for you, too. When you're ready. You can do this. It's not such a big scary thing. Trust me, you can still have fun, relax, enjoy life, be social, and have time for yourself. In fact, those things are better on the other side. All you are doing is getting rid of the smoking part.

I just wanted to say that if I can do this, then you definitely can, because I was the worst.

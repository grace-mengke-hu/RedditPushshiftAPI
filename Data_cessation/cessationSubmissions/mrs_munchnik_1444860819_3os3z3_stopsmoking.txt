feel sick, dizzy, and pain when smoking. made today my last day ...

I've been smoking now for approximately 15 years. I made this account in the hopes of getting this off my chest because I'm afraid to share why I'm quitting with my loved ones (they'll get nervous, I'll feel terrible for scaring them).  Within the last month, I feel ill when smoking.  I feel pain in my chest, dizzy, hard to explain, almost like an anxiety attack. So much so, I had to leave work early from feeling so ill today. I have been thinking about quitting for some months now, but today was my last cigarette - the one where I almost fainted from dizziness when smoking it.  I'm hopeful about quitting. I wish it hadn't taken fear of dying fairly young to prompt it.

I got my gym membership today, prepped for portion controlled eating to ensure I don't compensate smoking with food, and let my girlfriend know.

My biggest fear is how I treat my girlfriend when having a nicotine fit.  In the past, I generally get highly agitated, unreasonable, and can't think straight - my brain gets fuzzy and I just feel panicky until I have a cigarette. It's so bad, sometimes I'll leave my apartment at 1 or 2 in the morning to find an open store to buy a pack... as in, I can't even fall asleep without having a cigarette. 

How have you managed your emotions/mental state when first quitting? How have you not lost your shit on someone when you can't stop the noise in your head when you're dying for a cigarette? I've already chewed off my nails.  It's going to be a battle for sure. I just don't want to lose it.

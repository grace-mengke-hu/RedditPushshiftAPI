2nd day at work without smoking

I’ve been smoking regularly since 2 years now, and stopped for 3 weeks while in vacation, now back to work, didn’t smoke yet, but feel the urge to do it, 
just feel like it was easier to find alternative activities while in vacation, but now it got me nervous and anxious for not smoking
I hope I will stay clean longer, I feel my motivation to quite stronger than ever.

For me, Quit smoking is just the beginning...

Self, Wealth, People, Spirituality. Together, these are the aspects of life. 

Achieving balance in these can lead to life joy. Happiness to me is just a temporary state, but joy on the other hand is long lasting. 

Quit smoking is one of those high impact achievements. It spans across Self, Wealth, People, Spirituality. Health improvements, money saving, contemporary people find smoking taboo, and whether you believe in God or the universe, browny points is earned with the higher power. Positive in, Positive out. 

20 days since I quit. Week 1 and 2 was tough. 3rd week was way easier. Smoking now almost seems foreign to me. I think about it less, and even if I think about, it does not have the power over me to compel me to go and purchase them to smoke them. 

This experience of quitting the smoke has been positive thus far and giving me motivation to move forth and improve other areas of my life. 

People is next. Time to address my shyness. 

Prosperity to all.

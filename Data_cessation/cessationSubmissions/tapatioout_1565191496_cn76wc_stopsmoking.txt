I’ve been trying to make this post for 4 years

I finally made it to one week after 4 years of trying to quit and never making it ther. I’ve accomplished and overcome a lot this year and it’s given me the confidence to believe I can finally fucking beat this addiction and give myself a chance at life. I swore I was quitting for good in January and have been lying to everyone in my life since and smoking in secret. Thank you all so much for you inspiration. I’m crying as I write this because I truly never believed in myself that I could make this happen. It feels so good and I’m never going back.

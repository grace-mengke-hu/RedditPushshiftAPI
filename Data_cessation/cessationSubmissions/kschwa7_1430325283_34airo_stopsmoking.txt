Broke the adderall berrier

With finals week next week I've started my bout of adderall study sessions. This was one of the biggest things I was worried would trigger a relapse. Cuz when you are studying for hours with no end in sight, the next smoke brake is kind of all you have to look forward to. Anyway, I did it yesterday and came out victorious. I'm thinking less and less about cigs. The smoking dreams have stopped to. Good things.

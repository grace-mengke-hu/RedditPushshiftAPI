Ecig works like a charm.... until I start to lower the nic level.

Just wondering who else has struggled with this. I quit smoking completely(except for 2 cigars) for a month in january starting on 12 mg nic and after only like a week going to 6 mg and sticking with that. I had barely any cravings for a cig at 6 mg. 

However once I try to go lower then that I want a real smoke real soon. Lately i have been switching between smoking and vaping. It might be worth a try to go for a longer period at 6 before stepping the nic down, or just quit smoking and vaping cold turkey.

tl;dr  Finding the Ecig makes it super easy to quit smoking, but not nicotine.

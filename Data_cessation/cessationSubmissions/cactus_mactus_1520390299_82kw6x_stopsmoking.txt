Waiting for the day when I dislike the smell of tobacco...

Hi all - I'm in the midst of my third day off tobacco. I've been a habitual smoker 8 year smoker of Bugler, rolling my own, never including filters. I recently got a cold, which prompted this quit attempt (or whatever it is). Right now I can feel the phlegm rattling around in my chest but I can't for the life of me hack it out.

As a nursing student, I don't want to switch to vapes. I'm being taught that the real health issue (beyond lung damage) is the systemic &amp; cardiovascular effects of nicotine. 

A friend of mine keeps telling me that one day cigarettes will smell bad and I won't want to keep smoking. I'm still waiting for that day. (He's quit successfully, after only smoking for a year.)  

Do you ever lose that craving to smoke? Maybe I'm doing this wrong by thinking that "one day" I'll be free of this desire. Is it more reasonable to assume that I'll always crave? 

I quit for two months two years ago, and hopped right back on after my 30th birthday. 

Thanks for reading.

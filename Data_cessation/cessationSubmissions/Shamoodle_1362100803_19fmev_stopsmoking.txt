I'm having an issue....help!

So I'm on day 6 and I just started a new job as a cook and I've never been a cook. This is ramping up my anxiety to the max and with the added stress of being cold turkey for almost a week is overwhelming. My friends are saying that the occasional butt and don't buy packs ill be ok. But idk, I feel like its cheating.... I don't know what to do and I'm on the edge of bumming one just so I'm not so high strung and so I can sleep tonight..... HELP!!!!!!!

Edit: Thanks to all you awesome people I'm feeling MUCH better. THANKS!

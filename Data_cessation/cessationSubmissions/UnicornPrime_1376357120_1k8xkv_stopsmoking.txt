Is it still quitting if I have a casual smoke once or twice a month?

I smoked a pack a day for ten years. I haven't purchased a pack since memorial day. Once in a while, drinking and at social functions when others light up, i still bum a smoke or two. I don't crave them. I don't panic if i don't have a pack on me.  I don't seek them out or HAVE to have one. I just enjoy a nice tobacco once in a while. Am i still a smoker? Definitely don't feel like one.

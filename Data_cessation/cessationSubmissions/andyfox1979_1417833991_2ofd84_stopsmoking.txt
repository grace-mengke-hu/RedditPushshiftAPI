Extremely tired/sleepy after quitting 4 nights ago. Any advice?

Had my last cigarette on Monday afternoon. Just was sick and tired of smoking. Since then I've been extremely exhausted, sleeping up to 16 hours per day. 

Last night I felt better but today slept again so much.

I should note that even smoking I wasn't super high energy and may need to build my energy level up in a general sense but in past quits after a few days I'm full of energy and can hardly fall asleep. 

Any feedback??

Edit: been smoking for 20 years (35 years old) Quit for two years once. Tried quitting about 15 times

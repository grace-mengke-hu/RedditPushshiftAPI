I've tried THRICE and I've failed. I don't want to anymore

I've tried literally everything to stop smoking. Gum, patches, col-turkey, phasing out. I've not tried hard core medication because I'm a little worried about the possible side effects. I smoke around 10 per day and I want to quit before the larger effects creep in, I right now just become breathless when I run or work out. I enjoy the feeling of a smoke after a drink or during the boring phases of a work day, As most people might say, I never wanted to pick up smoking. I can't do this anymore and I need help and motivation from people who have done it. HALP!

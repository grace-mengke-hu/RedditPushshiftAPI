Woohoo! Can't even believe it

After starting smoking at 15 and continuing as a pack a day smoker for 15 years I have officially been quit for a whole month! I'm so excited. Quit cold turkey using Allen Carr's book and it's been awesomely easy. Both my husband and I quit using The Book (he's at 2 months) and it was the best thing we've ever done!

I feel literally 10 years younger. I have so much more energy, I can actually breath, I feel much more motivation to get healthy, (started exercising and eating better) and motivation to complete all the things I'v been trying to get done for years. All these gains and I gave up nothing except a drug addiction.

I wish all of you the best of luck on your journeys and hope that those of you who are on the fence will go for it and find out exactly what your missing because I can tell you it's a lot!

I think I'm not out yet, but feels right.

My first post after lurking for a few days...

Day 6 for me, quit cold turkey after ~20 years, instant decision without planing (after wife told me that I cough too much in the morning).
Found this place the second day and it helped me a lot during these few days

Last night was the first time after quitting that i managed to grab a few hours of normal sleep. Nights before it was just a funny strange floating experience from awake to asleep, sweatting, shivering, looking at the clock, drinking water, going to the toilet, repeat. Clock seemes to run slower; strange zombie-like nights.
Days are more managable; I feel like I can control the cravings (I'm stubborn af if I want to be)+ water, walks with dog. Under control.

Work efficiency and concentration span, on the other hand, reduced to 20% (working freelance from home). Hope this goes to normal asap, as I have to pay the bills.

Treated myself with some exotic fruits at the supermarket today (usually don't buy the shit because of "exotic" prices and money is tight). Felt good.

Hang on everybody, we will do it!

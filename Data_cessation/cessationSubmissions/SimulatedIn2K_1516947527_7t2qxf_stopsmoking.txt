Zoloft helped me completely quit cigarettes

Was on a Zoloft for 4 months and have been off of it for 2 and my desire to smoke is completely gone. I wasn't even trying to quit but after 1.5 months on Zoloft the desire to smoke just went away and I haven't smoked since. 

About 3 months on Zoloft I was hanging out with my brother who is a soon to be doctor and he offered me a cigarette and told him that I somehow quit. He mentioned that SSRIs are known to help some people quit. Just wanted to share my experience. 

Additionally I also stopped working out while on Zoloft and started craving a lot of fatty foods and gained 16 pounds which is why I stopped taking it. 16 doesn't sound like alot but I lost a lot of muscle mass so the weight gain was very pronounced. I've attempted to quit several times and my longest would be ~6 months, but would crave cigarettes from time to time especially while drinking. I finally feel like I've completely quit because I no longer have these cravings, even around smokers!

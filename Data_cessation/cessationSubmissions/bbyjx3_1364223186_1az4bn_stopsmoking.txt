Going to the Gym! Help!

Hello, I've been a smoker for two years and have finally quit! I used to be an avid runner and used to run 5ks in Central Park and such. However, two weeks ago I went to the gym and ten minutes on the treadmill I felt as though I was going to pass out and could hear my heart pulsating in my head. This really discouraged me because I wanted to start living a more healthy lifestyle after quitting. I guess it's also because I have such high expectations of myself running-wise which makes me ashamed and not wanting to go to the gym again. 

I'm terrified to venture to the gym again! The girl on the treadmill next to me definitely was judging my ability to barely sprint for ten minutes. I know I shouldn't care what others think and should try to beat my own inhibitions, but does anyone have any tips? Both psychological or physical wise to get back into my gym groove? How did you start incorporating working out with your current lung capacity?

Thanks again!

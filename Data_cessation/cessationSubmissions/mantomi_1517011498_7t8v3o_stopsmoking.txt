I already stopped smoking for almost 8 months now, last night i think i crave for it. :(

I stopped smoking for 8 months, i started going to gym and do exercise and i totally forget what cigarette is. even im drinking i dont get the urge of getting a cigarette. but lasi night when I was drinking some booze suddenly i get the urge or the crave again. but i fight this cravings and didnt give in to it. 

why even i stopped for almost 8 months, i still have this cravings/ urge feeling to smoke? when it will end?

Day 2. Want to make it stick this time.

I turned 30 this week.  As long as I've been a smoker I have told myself I wouldn't smoke after I turned 30.  My last smoke was Thursday night.  Last night was really hard.  Today has been tough as we'll but I'm feeling confident about getting over the hump of the first 3 days.  I've quit several times before but always ended up starting again a few months down the road.  What's your strategy for making your quit last forever?

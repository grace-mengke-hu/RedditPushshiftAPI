This Is It!!!

I've smoked my last cigarette! I'm comitted this time and have reset my badge for the last time. Been working on weight loss too (lost 85 pounds) and had a bad week but now it's time to get serious. I've listened to the Allan Carr audio book and I know all the stupid reasons my addicted mind will come up with to try to get me to smoke again, but it's not gonna happen!

Definitely am feeling relieved of this burden. And to anyone else in the same situation, just do it, you know you want to!

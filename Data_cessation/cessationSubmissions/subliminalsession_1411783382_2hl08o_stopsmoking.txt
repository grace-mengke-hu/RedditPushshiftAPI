I really don't know how much longer I can do this

I'm going through a really tough time right now but don't have many people to turn to because my close friends, unfortunately, have had bad things happen to them as well so I don't want to burden them with my crap when they have bigger fish to fry... I'm living in a house where tensions are high and my housemates all smoke, and day by day I'm finding myself grinding my teeth and crying at the urge to just say "fuck it" and start smoking again. I know I've come too far and I have never felt physically better (or emotionally worse) but every day is a battle and I'm losing the urge to fight and I don't know what I can do to keep myself going ;(

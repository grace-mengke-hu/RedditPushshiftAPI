QUITTING IS EASIER IF YOU HOLD THE POWER OF HABITS!!!

“Your beliefs become your thoughts,
Your thoughts become your words,
Your words become your actions,
Your actions become your habits,
Your habits become your values,
Your values become your destiny.”
― Mahatma Gandhi

Smoking is the worst habit that can be out there...

It is even worse than drinking alcohol when compared in damage it causes overtime...

As a recently quit smoker since the age of 15 I have finally understood why I couldn't stop smoking... IT IS ALL IN THE HABITS!!!

I am turning 21 this year so I have tried to quit countless of times for the past 6 years... I want you people here to understand it is just a habit and you can change your habit thus your life!

If you want to really quit smoking stop buying those strips, vapers and electronic cigs!!! Don't expect results from the outer! The changes come from yourself and how much you understand and win yourself!

Remember guys sky is the limit!

IT IS YOU VS YOURSELF!
Win yourself so you can win life...

I recommend this very well written, effective book that helped me tremendously to anyone who have been struggling!!!

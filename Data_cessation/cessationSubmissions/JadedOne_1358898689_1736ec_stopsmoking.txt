I quit smoking and my coworkers really stink.

I've stopped smoking for about two months now and while I never really enjoyed the smell of cigarettes, it's SO much worse now that I've quit. My coworkers smoke and every time they come back to their cubes from smoking, it literally makes me want to throw up. What can I do?

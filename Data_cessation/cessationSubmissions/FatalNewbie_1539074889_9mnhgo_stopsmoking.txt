Nicotine Spray &gt; Patches IMO

I never found success with patches when trying to quit, they just didn't seem to work for me. The first time I used a Nicotine spray however, it helped me quit. I think it's just the immediate substitute rather than something on a drip, so to speak. This might have been down to how I smoked (I was quite secretive about it so would only really have a couple in the morning before work and a few after work with maybe one before bed). If you are in a similar spot trying to quit, give spray a try if you haven't already.

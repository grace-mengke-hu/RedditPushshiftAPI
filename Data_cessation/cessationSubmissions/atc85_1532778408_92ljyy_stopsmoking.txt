1st weekend as a nonsmoker in my entire adult life!

So, I finally had enough. I’m in my early 30s and have been smoking since I was 15. Been smoking a pack a day since my 20s. I tried two wks ago. Kept giving in due to my own emotional excuses(none of which really were reason enough). So on Monday, I threw em out and haven’t looked back.  I keep saying in my head “fuck those ciggies”. The little laugh I get from seeing the word has helped me with my anxiety. Each day is getting easier. Don’t give up ppl. U can do it. We can beat this dumb shit. Fuck those ciggies!

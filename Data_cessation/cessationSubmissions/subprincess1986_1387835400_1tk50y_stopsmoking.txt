I want to quit sooooooo badly

I want to quit but when I even get through half a pack I'm already thinking about buying another one. 

I have a man I love more than anything, who HATES smoking. I have a beautiful three year old daughter that I need to be a good influence for. I have a long family history of breast cancer which is terrifying by itself, let alone the possibility of getting lung cancer. I'm tired of my breath and clothes smelling badly of smoke. I'm tired of the smoking making me sick. There really are countless reasons to quit. 

I just don't know how to start and stay with it long term. Also, I'm 27f and have been a pack a day smoker since I was 12. Please help me.

I quit smoking, but I'm not better than my friends that haven't yet

Last night I was at the bar with a couple friends and some camel smoking representatives came in to pass out free samples. When they asked me if I smoked I said proudly "I just quit!" and they said "good luck with that" in a pretty laughable tone.  At this point I had a couple drinks in me and I knew they couldn't really do anything to me because they were on the clock, so I asked them how it felt to work for "a terrible corporation." 

I thought it was funny, but a couple of my friends thought it was pretentious and dick-ish of me to say that to someone just doing their job.

I think that I have been acting like I'm better than my friends lately because I quit smoking and they didn't.  I need to realize that I was in their position once and that (hopefully) they will get to mine one day. 

I quit smoking, but I'm not better than my friends that haven't yet.  The people that are better than us as far as smoking are the people that never smoked at all.

Help

So I should preface this with the fact that I wasn’t a cigarette smoker, but rather a juul user. 

I’ve been juul/nicotine free for a little over six weeks, but I’ve nearly relapsed several times over the last week.

A few days ago, I injured myself and haven’t been able to put weight on my right leg. The process of finding out whether I tore a ligament or my meniscus has been so slow and the anxiety from not having answers and not being able to work has left me in a near perpetual state of panic. I’m struggling not to buy juul pods and I’m starting to forget why I quit. 

I know that part of quitting smoking is breaking the thought patterns that led to forming the habit, but being bed-bound has made reinforcing my new habits so difficult. Exercising was a HUGE part of how I cope with stress and was able to take my mind off of nicotine cravings. Since I can’t do that, I feel like I’m out of options. Does anyone have any advice on how to avoid relapsing?

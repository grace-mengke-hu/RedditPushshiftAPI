Almost 3 weeks

Not sure if this is the right format/reason to post but here goes, I quit cold turkey on the 25th of april. I smoked 10-20+ a day since I was about 15. I have tried to quit before but never for this long. Had some cravings, but I feel good about my prospects of quitting permanently. One problem has been the appetite increase which caught me a little off guard but I have started to work out more to compensate. Just posting this here as a record for myself mostly I guess, but I look forward to helping out others who are giving up as well.

Need help, 3 days in and about to crack.

Hi guys, so I'm three days in and have been doing really well until about two hours ago. Some huge cravings just hit me, but luckily I can put these off as long as I don't have access to cigarettes, I know if I am around them I will smoke one. I finish work in and hour and my two options for where to go after work are: 

A. My girlfriends house, where she smokes and I will have access to cigarettes.
B. My house, where my housemate smokes and once again will have access to cigarettes.

Do you guys have any suggestions as to how I can avoid this relapse?

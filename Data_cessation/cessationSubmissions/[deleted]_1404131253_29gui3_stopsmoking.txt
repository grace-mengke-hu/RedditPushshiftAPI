Day 1 of quitting smoking!

About a month ago, I started training to do a 5K. But because I'm a smoker, I am having trouble with the runs because I just can't breath.

So, today it came to the realization that I want to be able to run more than I want to smoke so I am giving my e-cig another shot.

The problems: my husband smokes and so it is very difficult for me to quit when I see him smoking. I also have extreme anxiety and are prone to attacks when I don't smoke.

Any advice is welcome! Thanks!

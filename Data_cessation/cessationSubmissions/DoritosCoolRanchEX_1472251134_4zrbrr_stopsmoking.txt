let's see how long i can stare directly into the sun

about a week ago i gave up pornography, which is so common i don't feel embarrassed to say it. haven't done that for eight days now and i'm feeling good but not great.

i guess it's not really that big of an achievement, considering there's another vice that's been my best friend for four years; cigarettes. i've smoked about a pack a day all four of those years. you guys get the idea.

i'm feeling bored. i'm feeling generous to my environment. there's a pack of 305 cigars sitting right next to me on my desk and the last time i had one was about an hour ago. i don't really "feel" like having one again. ideally ever, for the sake of my health.

i absolutely expect relapse, but i'm feeling a bit more disciplined and mature than i have for a long time. let's all get blue-lipped and withdrawn together, what do you say?

Wow Allen Carr has hooked me up... I just realized today is Day 100!

After 16 years of 1 pack a day "Easyway to Stop Smoking" by Allen Carr made the quitting process effortless, and today I am proud to say I am not a smoker! 

Edit: I forgot the thank this Sub for being supportive, and being my motivation, every time I look at that badge it tells me I made the best decision in my life.

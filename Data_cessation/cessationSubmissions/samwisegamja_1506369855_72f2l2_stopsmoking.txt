Almost 30days.. cravings are stronger than ever

Last time I quit I lasted ~2weeks. This time it's been almost a month. Cravings were ok until a few days ago when it spiked suddenly. So difficult. I am resisting but keep thinking that I will go back to smoking. I don't want this to be a self-fulfilling prophecy..

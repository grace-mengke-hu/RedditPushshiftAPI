I quit for 30 days about 200 days ago.  

My job got very stressful and I eventually lost it.  I am now looking for a new job and I'm really wanting to quit smoking again.  My badge reads 229 days smoke free but its not true anymore.  I'd like to go back to 0 days.

Edit: I have reset my badge, I'm hoping for the same support I received last time.  This is one of my favorite communities on Reddit, you all are amazing.

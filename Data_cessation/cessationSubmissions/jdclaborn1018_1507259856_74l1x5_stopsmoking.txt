How do you stay strong?

I've been attempting quitting smoking shortly after I began smoking. Almost 9 years on and off and on again. Probably more than 50 times. Sometimes it's lasted a few months. Other times a few hours. I want to say to myself, "look, go 6 months, the longest you've ever gone without a cigarette and you can live the rest of your life smoke free." But I always seem to return. Part of me believes there is inherent pleasure in smoking and the other part of me knows it's the psychological and physical addiction speaking.

Quitting is easy. I've done it more than 50 times. How do we stay strong through opportunities of "pleasure"? How do we bring awareness to this mindless and, I'll say it, utterly disgusting habit? I want to believe I can just go 6 months, to count the days, and live the rest of my life without this thing but the amount of times I've failed leaves me hopeless. Help.

Finals week I am so stressed

Is is been 32 days since I quit smoking and this time was easier. I didn't carve as much and I was fine. But this week is the finals week and I am not a hardworking student. I don't study much and when I don't study I get stressed. When I am stressed I want to smoke so bad. I used to smoke a lot when I study (or when I don't study). I used smoking as a delay button for studying. Now that I can't do that I constantly want to smoke. It feels like it is my first week quiting. I know smoking wont help me study but this feeling sucks.

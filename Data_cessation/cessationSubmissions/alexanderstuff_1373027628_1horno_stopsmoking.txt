Today i reached my 20 day mark :)

Im super excited. Despite a very stressful time at university right now i didnt pick up smoking again and im very proud of myself right now. After some time it wasnt that hard. I stoped quiet some times now and hopefully this was my last attempt. 
Now if im nervous or stressed, or even bored, i drink water. It seems stupid but it worked for me... so here's to /stopsmoking, you guys are great

I don't know if I can stop this time.

A few weeks ago, life got too overwhelming. I got a letter saying I owed money and everything is going wrong in life. Before it was always temporary with me knowing I was going to quit and stopping for years at a time. 

Now I don't know. I'm lonely and get very sad this time of year. That letter was the last straw and I can't deal with this. I'm failing at everything I try to be. I want to be a good mom. I want to support my family. After being strong for so long, now I am this weak thing that's sad and lonely and crying every night. I'm sorry for venting like this.

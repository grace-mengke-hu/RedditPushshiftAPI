2 months without nicotine

Hey everyone,

I'm new here but I need advice. I've been nicotine free for 2 months and I was warned about the weight gain (which was way worse than I was ready for) but it's the sleepless nights I can't handle. I didn't smoke that much before quitting, I hadn't been a daily smoker for some months yet I stopped sleeping when I stopped smoking fully. I don't really get cravings but I went to a doctor and he gave me sleeping pills that aren't working as well as they should. He told me that although mentally I'm not craving cigarettes my body is taking a long time adjusting to it. So my question is, should I start using nicotine patches or gum? I don't want to start smoking again but I just want to sleep.

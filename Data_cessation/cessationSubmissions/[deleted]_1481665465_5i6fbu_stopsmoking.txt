In the process of quitting

I have been trying to stop smoking for the last month, but it has not worked yet. I'm in college, I have a very busy and stressful life. When I go more than 24 hours without nicotine, I am unable to focus on any task. Therefore I gave up quitting cold turkey and focused on reducing first. Now a 25 pack lasts a little more than two days. And my final exam for this semester is this friday. after that, I will have the time to go through the withdrawal effects. Starting saturday the 17th I quit for good.

Help me dispel some mental blocks

Hi everyone, so tomorrow I'm going to quit smoking for ever. However, I have one mental block that is holding me back and that is the dreaded weight gain! I know it's ridiculous but I can't help worrying that when I quit I'm gonna gain loads of weight. What are your experiences with quitting and gaining weight? I know that the benefits in the long term vastly outweigh the cons but I feel like this is the one mental barrier holding me back. Thanks in advance and I really appreciate the positivity of this thread, it's been a great source of inspiration.

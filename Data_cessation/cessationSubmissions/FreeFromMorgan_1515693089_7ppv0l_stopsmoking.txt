While sitting on the couch with my dog I remembered how I used to have to get up to go sit in a cloud of horrible smelling smoke, then come back in and bother him and everyone else with my smell. That concept is insane to me now.

Trying to imagine doing that now just doesn't work, the whole idea of it is just so far removed it blows my mind I did it for so long. On top of that is all the money saved ($4,000+) I feel better, look better, smell better. Smoking is just so ridiculous. Keep at it, you can quit and one day you'll be so glad you did.

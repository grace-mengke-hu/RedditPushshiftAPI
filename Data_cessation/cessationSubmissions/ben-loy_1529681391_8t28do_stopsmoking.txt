I was a smoker for over 21 years. I quit 3 days ago.

I am feeling great. I am happy about my decision. That helps to reduce the stress levels by 99&amp;#37;. 

I quit cold turkey. No nicotine substitutions, no other tools or devices. Good old mind power. 

Smoked around 30 every day. 

I smell again. I never thought it was serious when they say: "quit smoking, you will get your sense of smell back".

By breath is cleaner. Gentle. It is so smooth now. It used to be rough. 

So much good is happening by the hour. Oh, man.

I lost the illusion that smoking is good for me. I truly believed it. I thought it is something that helps me through the day. this is the biggest fattest LIE ever. 

Smoking contributes nothing to your body, health, day, time and mind. It is only taking, not giving. 

Hope this motivates other to quit smoking. Anyone can do it. Even the heaviest smoker.

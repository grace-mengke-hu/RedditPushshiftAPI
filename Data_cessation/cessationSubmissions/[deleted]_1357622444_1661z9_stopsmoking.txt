The cravings are coming back

This post probably won't help any of you other quitters, but it'll help me get some things off my chest.  
  
I've been down lately, just in a bad place I guess. My moods been swinging. I've been lonely and depressed, often times irritable. I miss smoking, I really do. I think about cigarettes and I just break down. I'm jealous of smokers, of casual smokers, of anyone who is allowed to smoke. But I won't let myself, even though it makes me sad.  
  
I was smoking marijuana still when I quit smoking cigarettes, but I haven't since Christmas. I'm not quitting it or anything, just trying to save some money. It has been 14 days since I've smoked anything. I think maybe that was acting as a crutch for the cigarettes. Now that I don't have a crutch I feel like I'm falling. It would have been better if I didn't use marijuana to quit cigarettes.  
  
I guess that's all I have to say for now. Hopefully I'll get busier when I go back to college and won't have as much time to think about smoking. I don't have anyone I really feel comfortable confiding all this in, so thanks for being there for me /r/stopsmoking, love you, thanks.

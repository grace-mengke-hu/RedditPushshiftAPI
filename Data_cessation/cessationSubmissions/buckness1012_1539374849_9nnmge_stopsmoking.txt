Some quick tips to think about.

Hi all, not sure what flair says but I’m at a little over 2 years, I just posted one of my tips yesterday but I think people might like some more. These are things that helped me, they might not apply in all situations.

The one time that quitting worked for me, was the one time I didn’t tell anyone I was quitting. I just kept it internal and that gratification for my brain came when I actually realized I was done, not when someone congratulated me after 2 day like usual.

Once you choose to quit smoking, you are a non smoker. You’ve quit, there’s no reason to think “I’m quitting smoking”, you already did. Keeping that mentality helped to get over any “benchmarks” I just couldn’t get past.

After the first week (I kind of turned into a hermit for that part), I actually kind of made it a point to go outside and hang out with my friends that smoked. Seems counter intuitive, but it actually makes you feel soooo powerful when you walk back inside with everyone and you didn’t smoke.

Run. I went for runs all the time when I was quitting. Now I run about 12 miles a week due to that habit I formed instead of smoking.

Personally, I’ve only seen people have real long lasting success when they went cold turkey. Using any type of substitute will just keep you in the same mindset. Along with that, don’t ween yourself off. Once you quit, you aren’t a smoker anymore. Even one cig or one puff and you’re back to being a smoker.

Kind of in contradiction to my last point, when the cravings were absolutely terrible I would smoke a little pot. Not for the smoke, just for the change of mentality. You get tunnel vision when you have a craving and that relaxation really helped.

If anyone has questions feel free to PM me, life without cigs is fantastic and no one should have to deal with that bullshit anymore.

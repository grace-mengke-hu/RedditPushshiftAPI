Found a new trigger for cravings today.

So I have not been sleeping well the last couple days due to a couple of long nights at work, and now I find myself really tired and constantly craving a cigarette today. 

Sigh.. this sucks.

Edit: thanks everyone for the support. I got through the day without caving in. So it's a good day.

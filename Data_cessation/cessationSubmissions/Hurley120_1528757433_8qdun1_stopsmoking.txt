Does anyone have any tips that could help?

Alright guys I’m in my second week of quitting cigarettes (again) I’m using no nicotine replacement. So far I stopped drinking coffee and I drink tea now instead to stop the cigarette cravings after coffee. I’ve been using cough drops to keep my mouth busy and playing video games actually keeps my mind off smoking. My biggest concern on my second week is how do you not be so angry where you just want to yell at times?

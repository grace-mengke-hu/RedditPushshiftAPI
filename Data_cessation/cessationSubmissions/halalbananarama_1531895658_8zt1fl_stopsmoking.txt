quitting again

hey everyone, 

so this is my Final attempt to quit smoking. i dont really want to post this but im trying to hold myself acountable. ive quit a bunch of times in a bunch of ways but i always seem to slip up. the odd puff here turns into the odd cig when im drunk. turns into smoking all day every day with a frightening regularity. 
so im now on day 2 of this attempt. im not using any gimmics, ive been through them all. im not reading Allan Carr as ive read it so many times. this time  im juat going to be diciplined and not let this hunger beat me.

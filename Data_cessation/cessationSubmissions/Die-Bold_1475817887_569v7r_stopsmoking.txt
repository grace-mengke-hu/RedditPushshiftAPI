Passed the 4 year mark almost 3 weeks ago. I know it seems daunting and depressing to give up a thing you like, but the end result is awesome. Eventually, the only thing left will be a glimmer of nostalgia. You will not miss smoking.

One of my keys has been no exceptions. None.

I will smoke the occasional herb but not a single puff of tobacco product.

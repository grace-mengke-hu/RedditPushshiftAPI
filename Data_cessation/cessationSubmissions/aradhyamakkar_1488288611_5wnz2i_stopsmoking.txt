How to tame weight gain after quitting?

I was a heavy smoker (10 cigs daily) and I quit cold turkey 5 days ago. 
I have heard that after quitting weight increases. I can already feel my appetite increasing and I haven't smoked for like 5 days. Can I not increase my fat and just increase my muscle mass? Or better reduce my fat and increase my muscle mass? 
I have been doing the latter for 4-5 months now. I have reduced 13 Kgs of fat and increased 5 kg of muscle mass by doing calisthenics. And since my appetite has increased, I think it'll be hard to continue losing fat. 

this article says that after quitting fat also usually increases -

I want to avoid that. Is it possible (without too much struggle)? Please share your experience and some tips. I am already feeling some withdrawal symptoms and I don't want to feel hungry.

Also, when will my ability to concentrate improve? I am finding it hard to concentrate after quitting.

Drunken cigar filled evening. Still a non smoker :)

We were at a wedding last night and after about 3 drinks the urge to smoke was getting crazy intense, and I was not in a good place mentally,  so I stopped drinking to the evening. Spent over an hour on the patio with my husband and th guys all smoking cigars.... And I was OK.I wondered if I could have cigar, but knew I didn't actually want one and that it wouldn't make me feel better about not having cigarettes. So I just kept on not smoking. *self high five*

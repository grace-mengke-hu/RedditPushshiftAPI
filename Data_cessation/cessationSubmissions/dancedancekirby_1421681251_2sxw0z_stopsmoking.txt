I can do this

I've suffered from depression for a very long time, sometimes I felt like my only joy in life was being able to smoke. Now smoking is no longer part of my life and I'm having a hard time finding a replacement. My job is eight hours of Hell and then I go home to a screaming child, a messy house and a dinner that won't cook itself. 

My boyfriend is smoking too..actually I don't think he ever quit though we decided to do this together and now I'm the only one suffering. WTF? Why am I suffering alone? Why am I miserable? We wanted to quit for our child, we wanted to quit to save up for a car and we said we'd do this together and it's bullshit. 

Anyway, instead of driving down to the gas station to buy a pack of cigarettes I'm ranting again so I'm sorry guys. I bitch a lot and I'm sorry I gotta do it here but I have no one else. I can do this but I'm having a really hard time today.

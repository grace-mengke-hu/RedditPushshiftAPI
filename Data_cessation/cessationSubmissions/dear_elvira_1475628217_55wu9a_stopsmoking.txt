3 months, 14 days, 20 hours... down the drain...

After more than 15 weeks without smoking, my depression kicked in and.... you know what, that's not even a valid excuse. In a moment of weakness, I gave in and bought a pack of cigarettes. This was 15 minutes ago. I felt no satisfaction from smoking another one of these fucking things. The shame and guilt is overwhelming. I was doing so well, too. I thought I had it beat. I thought the 10 years of slowly killing myself were behind me.

2016 was a year of progress for me. In january, I quit for 3 weeks before smoking again. two months later, I quit again for over a month. smoked again. quit again. and now here I am. back in god damn square one. I gotta cut this demon off of me. wish me luck...

Trying to quit but failing in the nights

I quit this Sunday. I didn't smoke at all during the day yesterday and today but when I get home from work I have a strong urge to smoke. I smoked one yesterday evening and one today when I got home from work. 


I normally smoke a pack a day. 


How do I get  over this urge to smoke in the evening? I felt worse today and yesterday after I took the one cigarette but I still want to do it somehow.

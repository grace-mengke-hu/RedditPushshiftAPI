Just tore up my pack

Decided to tear up my pack. 22 yr old half pack a day smoker for 5 years. Got a real bad post nasal drip atm and sick to death of feeling like shit all the time. Been lurking here for a while working up the courage to post and quit, wish me luck!

Edit: Also forgot to put in, would appreciate any advice if anyone has any to spare.

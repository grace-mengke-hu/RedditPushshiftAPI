3 weeks

 I've been a smoker for 22 years. I feel ashamed even writing it. I've quit 2 times before, during my pregnancies (for a year each time) and countless 1-3 days before crumbling, attempts.
I'm a complete addict and loved smoking even though I hated the smell, stigma and financial drain.

This time I'm going to do it. My daughter is dealing with a serious illness requiring her to be incredibly strong and brave. Quitting is nothing in comparison, despite the stress of the situation. She is my inspiration and motivation 

So today marks 3 weeks since my last cigarette.

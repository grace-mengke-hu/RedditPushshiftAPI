33 days smoke-free. First post here.

I quit smoking September 17th, after smoking for almost 25 years. I vaped for a couple weeks, then cut that out too.  It's gotten a lot easier for me lately, but I still really jones for one after I eat.  What do people do after they eat?  I don't feel like I've finished a meal unless I smoke.

Anyway, this post is for those folks who haven't taken the leap yet.  I never thought I'd be able to quit.  Cigarettes had become such a big part of my life.  I almost have to redefine who I am.  It's a good thing.  It's a major confidence booster knowing that I have what it takes to quit.  You can too.

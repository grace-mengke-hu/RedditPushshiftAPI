Quitting inspired me.

I quit cold turkey after 18 years, and I'm only 32. The dedication and determination to succeed I've shown myself has motivated me to continue my journey to a healthier life. I started a program called 'couch to 5k' (C25K). I never ran before, smoking made it hard. I'm excited to see where quitting smoking takes me. Thanks for the support!

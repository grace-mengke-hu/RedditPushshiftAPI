Please quit smoking

I have been trying to quit smoking for well over a year, with mixed succes. I managed to quit quit, sometimes for months on end, but also experienced relapse multiple times.

Last month, my mother (49) was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer. It is most likely terminal. She was a smoker, ofcourse. She also tried to quit many times, and even started seeing a tabaccologist just weeks before getting diagnosed with cancer. Too little, too late.

I smoked TWO packs a day the week after the diagnosis. I always smoke more when I'm stressed. However, I am completely done with it now. Out of respect for my mother and myself. Everybody, please, love yourself and stop smoking now. Just do it.

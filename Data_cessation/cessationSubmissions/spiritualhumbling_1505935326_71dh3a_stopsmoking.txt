Have seasonal allergies. Living with a grandmother who has chain-smokes indoors while it reaches my room.

I've been put in a ridiculous pickle. I've experienced second hand smoking since moving in 4 years ago, having recently quit now! (which I'm super happy about).  Well, anyway my allergies are now worse upon smelling cigarette smoke which has made me cough my lungs to death. I'd like to be able to use as many precautions as to not smell smoke while I'm sleeping/breathing in the space. 

Her smoking doesn't in any way make me crave one, it's making me hate smoking even more.

I went to work (which was the beginning of my smoking days) and informed everyone I quit, I was met with encouraging words and an accountability method. It was so hard not caving in after lunch for that smoke! That I had to drink two cups of tea and have conversation (similar to that of a cig break convo) while the cravings subsided.

My question is how do I navigate my home space in a way where I won't be affected by the smoke my inconsiderate grandmother produces? What sets the living room and my room apart is a huge ass closet/bookcase type concoction - so there are spaces where smoke will inevitably pass. I will buy an air purifier when I get my salary next month. I can put a bulk of charcoal to evade the smoke. The thing is, my grandmother has chain-smoked for 30 years - and going in this house, so you can imagine the fucking state of the walls and the furniture. Is it hopeless? I'm wearing disposable masks while going to sleep but what an inconvenient and uncomfortable sleep. 

Sincerely, 
A fed up granddaughter

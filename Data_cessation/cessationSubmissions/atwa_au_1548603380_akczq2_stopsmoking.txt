I never thought I'd be happy about it

I've had trouble in the past trying to quit as i saw cigarettes as my one true friend, smoking was 'my time', it was for me. It's sad now when I think about it. I was terrified of quitting and when I'd make attempts I'd become depressed, angry and out of control.

Here I am heading to day 5 and I just know if I got through day 1 ok, I can get through anything. I thought I loved smoking, I'd fooled myself into thinking it was a pleasure. And now I am thrilled to feel relief and reward simply by not smoking.

I know there will likely be some tough times ahead, I've tried and failed before. But what else do I have to lose? All I need to do is not smoke. And if the boot camp book by Allen Carr taught me anything, its that as a smoker, you spend your whole life craving a cigarette, except for the 3 seconds after you've lit one. So is quitting really that different? 

I've seen people write posts like this in the past and I hated it. I thought they had some secret I didn't or weren't a 'real smoker' or whatever excuse I could find. Don't give up. Don't be hard on yourself. Try again and try new things. If I can do it, just about anyone can, honestly. Good luck!

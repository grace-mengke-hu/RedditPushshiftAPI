It is December 10th. It is the day

**Today we begin! This is the thread to post thoughts, feelings, tips, etc (so we don't crazy flood the sub).**

First - Grab a badge everyone! Start tracking.

I'm impressed with how nervous I am about this. It's like if I had a pack next to me right now I'd be ok. But because I don't and I'm scared. But everytime I feel myself thinking about it, I ask myself "why?" 

Have you ever realized how fucking nuts any answer is to that question? There's no answer that's not crazy stupid.

**Videos** - I know it's been brought up a bunch, [but here's the Alan Carr video everyone has been talking abou](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATo8X4DGWaI&list=RDATo8X4DGWaI#t=194)t. I really appreciate it's simple truth.

Please feel free to share any other tips you have for us, me, you, etc. 

 Wish me and everyone else luck.

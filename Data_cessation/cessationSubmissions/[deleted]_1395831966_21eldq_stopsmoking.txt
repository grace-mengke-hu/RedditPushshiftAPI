Urges to smoke without a goal

I smoke cigarettes quite frequently when I do not have a healthy goal (start fitness, reduce weight, strengthen muscles, go cycling, learn swimming, skiing). Until now everytime I wanted to learn something new, I had the calibre to quit smoking and follow a schedule to achieve my goal. After the goal is accomplished (after skiing holidays, getting thinner, strengthen muscles), I drift away from the regular schedule. I have reached the goal and now I do not have motivation to go back to the schedule. 

I was going to fitness to strengthen my leg muscles and my stamina for skiing holidays. After the holidays, I feel the training was a success and now I do not have a need to get back to training. 

Since last 2 weeks I have not gone to fitness citing my knee aches. I think I am very well fooling myself. I did not smoke since 3 months. Yesterday I bought a full pack of cigarettes and it feels like having a loaded gun in my hands.

I feel the urge to smoke every night. In the morning I get up sad and depressed and bummed that I was stupid enough to think about smoking. I didn't smoke yet.

I dont have any goals right now and it is making me a weak person. I find diversion from smoking when I find a healthy activity. Help me overcome this mental block. I don't know if it is same with others. Is it really same with others?

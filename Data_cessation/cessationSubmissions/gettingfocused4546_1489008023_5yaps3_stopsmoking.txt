I'm done

Hey folks, I just wanted to write up a brief version of my smoking story and how my quit is going so far. I've been smoking since I was 22. It started as something I did while I was drinking, then gradually picked up with a cigarette on the way to and from work, then a few smoke breaks during the day. By the time I was 27, I was up to a pack a day. The entire time, I tried hard to hide that I was smoking. I used mouth wash and hand sanitizer constantly and I would rarely smoke around others, even fellow smokers. 

I tried many times to quit, but never really gave it my all. On 3/4/17, shortly before my 30th birthday, I tried again and it's sticking so far. There are two main differences between this time and previous attempts:

1. I'm using the patch consistently.
2. I told my friends. 

On previous attempts, I was so ashamed of being a smoker that I never told anyone I was quitting. I had to go through a process of "coming out of the closet" as a smoker before I could reach out for help. I also had to really want the help.

So far, so good. I've been irritable and I've had cravings, but they're not insurmountable. I'm keeping myself distracted, reaching out to friends, and just plugging along. 

Good luck to everyone who's doing this with me!

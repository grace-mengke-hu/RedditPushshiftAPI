I'm quitting (fingers crossed)

Hey all, 

I'm Al and I want to kick the habit. I have been smoking solidly since about November last year (about a pack a day). I used to smoke a few years back for a period of about 4 years, and managed to stop (aside from a few cheeky darts when out on the weekends). Anyway, this time around it's proving a little difficult to stop.

Recently, I have kept telling myself that I'm going to stop - as in, this will be my last pack, no more from tomorrow. This has been going on for about 6 weeks now and I just keep on heading to the dairy (dairy = convenience stores for those not in NZ) to get another pack.

It's weird - I seem to just smoke as a 'thing to do' when I'm sitting down either reading, watching a movie, sinking time into the internet, etc.... It's not really like I 'need' it, but more as a thing to do to pass time.

Anyway, I'm getting sick of smoking. I'll get home from work, have a chat to the flatmates, then run upstairs and put a jacket on and light up. I'll then take the jacket off, spray on some man perfume and head back downstairs. This happens frequently during an evening. I don't like doing this sneaking off and smoking business / just general smoking business, and so want to stop for good.

I've tried to give up in the past couple of months, but it generally would just last for a couple of days, then I'll cave and head out to get another pack. It sucks hard.

I'd really just love a little bit of advice on things to do that may have helped you to kick the habit. (I'll try to refrain from getting patches etc to use if nothing else appears to work) - I'm hoping that just joining / participating in this community will be a good base and keep me motivated.

Thanks all,
Much Love.

**TL;DR I want to quit smoking and I thought joining this community would be a great start (and hopefully give a little support/advice/whatever)**

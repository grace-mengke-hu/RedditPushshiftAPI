Really stuggling today

It's been almost four months since my last cigarette (I need to update my quit date on here), and today is by far the hardest day so far. 

Last night I was offered a cigarette by a friend at a bar. He took it out of the pack and started to hand it to me. My boyfriend who is also trying to quit declined. Later that night he did end up smoking. I did not. 

Today, I found out that a person I knew in high school passed away. I am currently at work stressing bad. 

I just need some support since I can't seem to get this craving out of my head.

Thanks for reading.

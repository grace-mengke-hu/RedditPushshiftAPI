Eye opening story to tell.

So yesterday for work I had a chauffeur driver pick me up to drive me to the airport, I sat up the font seat for a chat and this guy was saying he ran a bar for 30 years and also developed a serious drinking problem which led to serious problems with he's health down the track. 

I asked him if he ever smoked, he cringed and said 'God no I would of never done such a thing" and continued ... "Whenever I would see these kids in the bar smoking especially the good looking young ones I would ask them 'so since when did you become suicidal?' They looked at me all shocked and argued I replied 'you know exactly right those things are killing you, yet you still choose to smoke, that to me is a sign of suicidal behaviour whether conscious about it or not" 
He then went on to say that people would return sometime after days or weeks later and say "Rick what you said to me really hit me, I've actually never looked at it that way before, but you're right!"

This man sent a shiver down my spine on just how ignorant and delusional I ever was to smoke in the first place, and I'm glad this conversation came to be.

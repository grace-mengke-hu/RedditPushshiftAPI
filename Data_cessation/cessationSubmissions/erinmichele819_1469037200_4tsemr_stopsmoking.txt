A quick look at the front page of this sub shows a lot of newer quitters...

I came to check on my badge (1219 days!) just out of curiosity and noticed a lot of the top posts in the sub were from new quitters, a lot of whom are struggling. 

Please know that whatever sucks right now gets SO much better. The coughing, the rage, the random cravings...it all evens out and eventually you feel normal again. Every minute isn't being forced to not think about a cigarette. Every car ride isn't a struggle. Every day isn't a singe digit number, hoping you get to two weeks smoke free. I promise. 

Just
Keep 
Going

Do whatever it takes to no smoke. Cry, eat, dance, scream into a pillow, walk, paint your nails, bite your nails!, make a phone call, play a game on your phone, drink tons of water, chew pen caps til your gums bleed JUST DON"T SMOKE. *all things I did by the way, and while I don't sincerely recommend all of them, I am 1219 days quit.*

I hope I helped at least one person today. Comment, we can chat if you need to be distracted. My boyfriend is coming up on one year and I can't wait to celebrate with him. I'll be celebrating you all toO!

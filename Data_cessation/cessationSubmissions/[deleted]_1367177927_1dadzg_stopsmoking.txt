Something to think about.

The CEO of RJ Reynolds made $16.2 million last year. I am a poor college student. I made $11,000 last year.

So, that CEO is a millionaire off of poor people addicted to a harmful product. The last craving I had, I thought about that CEO laughing all the way to the bank. Really nipped it in the butt.

I just realized that I've got this!

I was out with a few friends around halloween and we went to a costume party.  I spent a good amount of time in the backyard around a lot of people who were smoking and drinking.  I was partaking in the latter.  Although I did notice the people around me smoking, I didn't feel the need to ask for a cigarette, and I didn't even say to myself, "Man, I'd really enjoy a stick right about now."  It just didn't happen.  So, I feel like it it's completely within my power to stay clean.

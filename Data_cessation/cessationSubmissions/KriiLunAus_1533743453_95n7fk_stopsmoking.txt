Question about quitting

So I got an app to help me quit by reducing the number of cigarettes allowed and spaces the time out longer for each day. I am struggling so bad. I bought lollipops, pretzel rods, and tried keeping the cigarettes in my car and not on me, but no luck. Driving and work are my biggest triggers. I'm going to hand my smokes over to my boss while working so he only gives me one when the app says I can smoke. Any other tips on this? I was doing 30 a day and set the quit time for 9 days because I wanted to be done by the time I go on a 5 hour road trip. 

Health isn't a motivator because I had cancer and the second I would leave the cancer center I would be smoking like crazy in the parking lot ðŸ˜”

I was just wondering about the patch.  Do you become addicted to the patch vs cigarettes? I don't want to trade one addiction for another. 

I leave Tuesday morning so I'm really worried I won't make it on my quit day Tuesday. 

Thanks friends!

Day 19, and it's been rather difficult for some unrelated reasons.

Hello.

I am back on here after almost two years (last post February or March 2014). As you can see, I've been trying to quit nicotine for some time. For the past 1.5 years, I have not smoked, but I have been addicted to the electronic cigarettes. I want to be absolutely done with those as well. A lot of people treat them as a God-send, but I'm not too convinced. We haven't had serious LONG-TERM studies of their safety, and they're still expensive, cumbersome, etc. Most importantly, they never did anything for my nicotine addiction, just the smoking.

Anyhow, I'm on day 19 now. I'm on vacation with my GF (a smoker), and we're not doing incredibly well. Beyond that, I haven't seen the sun in almost a month, and I won't see it for another two weeks looking at the forecast. When I go this long without seeing the sun--which happens rather frequently--it really does begin to weigh on me.

I don't know. I crave an e-cig a lot here and there. Whenever I'm feeling down or nervous (I'm always nervous), I fantasize about vaping. To dispel these thoughts, I list all the things I hate about vaping...the sickly sweet smell of the vapor, the ridiculousness of the e-cig's look, the annoyance it causes people around me, the possible health risks, and the ADDICTION it feeds. It cures this addiction for some people, but it feeds it for me.

In any case, I could use some encouragement. I don't mean to offend those who trust in e-cigs. I know they've helped a lot of people. But I hate them and they aren't working for me. Any advice would be great. Trying to make this one stick :)

I need help!!!

I am smoke free for six months after 23 years of smoking everyday!!!! I have come back home on holiday and everywhere I go it's friend and family that smoke and I feel so out of place when I have to say no thank...  
I need help or some motivation to stay clean as i am now starting to feel cravings that i did not have before especially when I go to places and see people who are so familiar to me and my bad habit of smoking...

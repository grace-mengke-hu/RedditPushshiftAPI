3 days now

Yes I decided to quit. Today I feel already better than 3 days ago and every day it gets a little better. I still have so much situations where I really want to smoke, but I have to stay strong and I will. After 14 years as a smoker it's time to say goodbye. I don't want to make it 15 years.

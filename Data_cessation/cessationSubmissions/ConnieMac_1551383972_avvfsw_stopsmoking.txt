Day 11: Worried That Depression Won't Go Away

I'm on day 11 of a cold turkey quit and still dealing with bad cravings. But the depression is what really worries me. I have bipolar disorder and regularly experience debilitating depression that can last months. With my current combination of meds I've been depression-free for 6 months. Around day 8 of my quit I started feeling depressed and since then it's gotten worse. I think I'm in trouble if the depression from withdrawals lingers, as it could land me in a hole that I get stuck in for months. I'm hoping that the brain fog, cravings, and emptiness from withdrawals ease up so I can bounce back and prevent this backslide. I'll keep going if the light at the end of the tunnel is close. Otherwise I think I'm putting myself in danger of triggering a lasting depressive episode.

I'm consulting with a doctor but I'd also love to hear from this community. Please tell me your story if you experienced depression during your quit. Also would like to hear from people who have clinical depression/other psychiatric conditions... How did you manage your quit? Are there better ways to go than cold turkey?

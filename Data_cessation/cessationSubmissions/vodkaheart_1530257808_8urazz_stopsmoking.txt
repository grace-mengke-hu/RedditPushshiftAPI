Slipped up on my birthday, but now more motivated than ever

This past Sunday was my birthday, and after a previous slip-up, I had been going strong for a little over a week. Well, I drank until 6:30 a.m. on Saturday and smoked more than a few cigarettes. I woke up with a HELLISH headache, and felt like shit all day. 


Falling so hard made me want to finally stop all together. What's strange is that before my slip-up, cigarettes went from smelling like raisins and wood (if that makes any sense at all) to dirt and asphalt. But as soon as I slipped up, the raisin and wood smell came back. I feel like my body was starting to switch over from liking the smell to hating it, and I reversed that switch. It's been five days since then, and I haven't had any temptations, so I'm feeling good! 


I'm curious though; has anyone else had this happen with the smell of cigarettes? And also, please send some tips and motivation my way! I want to stick it out for real this time.

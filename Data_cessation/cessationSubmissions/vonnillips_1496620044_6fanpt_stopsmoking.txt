Cracked last night when I was drunk

I was honestly grossed out by the cigarette. I only had a couple puffs and put it out because I wasn't enjoying it. I'm only posting to tell you all I've been to the other side now and it sucked. Your memory of smoking when you crave is a false glorification of a gross habit. I learned my lesson, I'm just bummed to have to reset that fucking app.

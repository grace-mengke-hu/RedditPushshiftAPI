Does anyone feel the same?

Hi guys!

I just need to have reassurance about this: i'm on my 7th day and everynight (since day 4) I cry because I'm tired of remembering that I can't smoke. It's like if my craving were making me so tired that I start to cry and to get angry.

And I'm tired of crying and getting mad because I can't smoke. I only feel like that at night and it's hard to not smoke when the only thing that could make me feel better is a cig (btw, I didn't relapse but everyday it gets harder because of that).

I'm just wondering if anyone of you ever went through this. Is this emotional mess gonna end? Is this normal on day 7 to still feel like that?  What should I do?

Sorry for bad english (I still hope it's clear enough haha)

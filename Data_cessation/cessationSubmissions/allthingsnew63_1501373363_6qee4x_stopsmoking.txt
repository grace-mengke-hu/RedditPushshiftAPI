Looking for people who quit using nicotine patches - have a question that I can't find an answer for.

I am 5 weeks in as of yesterday on Step 1 (21 mg) patches.  After week 8, you are supposed to go down to Step 2 (14 mg) and after week 10, do Step 3 (7 mg) for 2 more weeks.  When you make these transitions, is it very difficult?  What can I expect?

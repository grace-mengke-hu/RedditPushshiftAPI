Day 16 last night..

Starting to feel like I can actually do this.  I am using NRT but slowly weaning myself off of it.  

Did 7 days earlier last month and relapsed and bought a couple packs but did not enjoy it as much as I thought I would.  Probably because I was disappointed in myself for relapsing.

Cliche as fuck but don't give up and keep going.  I miss smoking so much and get a huge craving every time I walk by someone smoking but the benefits are there.  I can breath clearly, smell and taste everything, and wake up with a lot of energy.  

It is possible!

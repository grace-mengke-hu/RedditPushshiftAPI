Just wanted to say...

I quit smoking around 4 years ago, weeks before my 30th birthday.
I wasn't on reddit at the time but being a non smoker means so much to me now that I just wanted to come in and give everyone a bit of moral support. 
Keep strong, it gets much easier and you'll be so glad you did it.
I wish I had this subreddit at the time.

I quit smoking around 130 or so days ago and I have some questions about exercise.

One day I decided to quit smoking after smoking on and off for around 7 years. At my best it was only one or two a day, at my worst it was a pack a day. It fluctuated. I also smoked a lot of weed and quit that a while back too.

I recently moved and decided that I was going to start running around the block, but my lungs feel like they are straining for oxygen even when I'm just sitting around. That could mostly be anxiety since I have a mild form of schizophrenia.

My nose and throat always feel slightly swollen and I'm always over-producing mucus and wheezing. After going on a jog around the block I probably spit up two cups of saliva.

I'm wondering if this is normal and something I'll get over and possibly a side effect of quitting smoking 4 months ago.

(I should mention that my blood pressure is a little high and my lung function is 'normal')

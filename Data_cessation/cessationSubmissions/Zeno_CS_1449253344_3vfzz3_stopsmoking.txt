Dizziness when french inhaling?

So, I'm 17, been smoking for a while now, yeah I know its bad but I feel like I can cut it completely since now Ive turned to vaping and some rare hookah, but the thing is, i remember the lightheadedness from when I first started smoking, in the beginning it even frightened me when it first hapenned.  Now i never get dizzy after any amount of smoking, but.... For some reason If i french inhale a few times in a row, or super deeply, It makes me feel quite lightheaded and not in a good way. This might be stupid but Is this normal guys? It couldnt be dangerous or anything?

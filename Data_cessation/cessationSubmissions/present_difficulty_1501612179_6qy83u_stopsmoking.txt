Have any of you used Cytisine to quit?

Owing to my mental health history, I wasn't comfortable using Chantix and so I've just ordered 100 tablets (21-day course) of Cytisine. It all seems fairly straightforward but I was wondering if anyone here has experience with this process? Any advice? Thank you in advance!

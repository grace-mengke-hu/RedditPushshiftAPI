4 days smoke free. Feel like I have a cold..

It's only been 4 days but I think this time I'm super determined to never start again. I feel like I have a cold (sore throat, nasal drip) and have read that it is a side effect from the withdrawal of nicotine but can't find a scientific explanation for this anywhere...? Anyone know the mechanism behind feeling this way..?

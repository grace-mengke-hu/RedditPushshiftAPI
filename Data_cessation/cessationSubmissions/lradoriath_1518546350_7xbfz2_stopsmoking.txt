Puffed after 3 weeks, now what?

So my girlfriend smokes and I quit smoking more than 3 weeks ago. She hit my car today, when I was inspecting the car when she brought it home, she was smoking, so with a moment of anger I took the cigarette out of her hands, puffed 1 breath and threw it away. Now what? I don't crave another one, I don't want to go get a new pack. I am kind embarrassed that I did it and mad at myself. So, do I reset my timer? Are the health benefits gone for the last 3 weeks?

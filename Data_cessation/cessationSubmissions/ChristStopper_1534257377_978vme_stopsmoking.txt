Don't upvote. 76 day streak broken. Accountability post.

I broke tonight. I've been struggling with mental health issues over the last 18 months and found myself heading towards a high place to jump from. 

I called the one person I still have in my life that's there for me and she helped talk me down. I ended up driving around for hours trying to clear my head and used it as an excuse to go and buy smokes. Before any respond saying otherwise it was an excuse. I was alright and didn't need to. 

I've smoked 3 of a packet of 26. 

I plan on smoking the rest in the next 24 hours and stopping again. I've reset Smoke Free App completely because you should when you fuck up. I also accept I should throw the rest out but I won't, i have them and want them now. 

This post is to keep myself accountable with stopping when they are gone. I feel hollow but that's most likely the depression. 

Thanks for reading.

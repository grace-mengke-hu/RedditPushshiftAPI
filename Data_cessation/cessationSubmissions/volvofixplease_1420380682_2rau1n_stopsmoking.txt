Being a non smoker is so easy

the first 15days were hell for me but yesterday i managed to fall asleep at 10pm and i woke up at 10am,its 5pm where i live right now and i feel like a normal person and like i have never really smoked or even liked cigarettes ever.its such a great feeling watching your friends putting those sticks in their mouth without craving one yourself.I think im free you guys.

Held a cigarette for couple of minutes - still got no urge to smoke.

So my friend and I went to this deli last night. He asks the person to make him a BLT sandwich and we both go out for a while because he wanted to smoke and asked me if I could give him some company. So we are out and talking and after a few minutes he asks me to hold his half smoked cigarette because he wants to go in and get his food. I was sort of scared because I didn't trust myself at the moment but I took it as a challenge to myself and held it. He went in, grabbed his grub and came out, took him like 3 minutes. I had that butt held in between my fingers for whole 3 minutes and I didn't even feel like taking a drag out of it. This is like a huge progress for someone who used to smoke 5-7-10 cigs each day, every day just 60 days ago.
I can now say I believe I finally broke free from the prison of cigarettes.

It’s time to quit

All forms of smoking, what kind of withdrawals am I expected to experience and what’s the best way to deal with them? I’m used to cigars and just the act of smoking (not sure if that will be of any helpful information) I plan on riding my bike rather than driving, since it’s habit to smoke and drive.  But it’s time help a bro out please.

Day one and struggling

Over the past year I have used stress and my anxiety/depression as an excuse to let my health go. I have put on 10kg's in this time and gone from a social smoker to 20-40/day. Because I've always been a relatively light smoker whenever I have just wanted to stop it wasnt a huge deal - but this time it just feels like too much. Additionally I feel like I can't breathe at all and just generally incredibly ill. This is obviously to be expected but really I just need to vent - I didn't realise how hard it was actually going to be. Wish me luck guys - because I'm not going through this again.

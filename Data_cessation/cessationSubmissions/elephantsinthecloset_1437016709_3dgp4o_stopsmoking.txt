Intense brain fog?

First thank you all for the great info, insights and positive comments on this sub. I have been mostly lurking on and off for a year and then constantly since quit day. This sub has helped me alot.

It has been 45 days since my last
 cigarette and 36 days since I last had any nicotine. I have had chronic and very intense brain fog and fatigue. It has been difficult to get any work done. My brain just does not work right. I am slow and forgetful and zone out constantly. It kind of feels like that feeling you get when the sun is really bright in your eyes  but all the damn time. It is effecting my job performance in a big way and causing me alot of anxiety. 

Trying to keep my head up and not smoke today. Worried that there is something medically wrong at this point since it has not relented yet. Have been doing my best to drink enough water and keep my blood sugar level. Anyone else experience it this far into the quit? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.


Edit: Looks like I'll be going to the doctor. Thank you all.

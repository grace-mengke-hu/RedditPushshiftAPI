3 days in....after 28 yrs smoking

I have tried many times over the last 28 yrs to quit.  I had been thinking about trying again around New Years.  Got the flu, threw away my cigarettes and downloaded a great quit app.

I left the house yesterday to run some errands and was not even tempted to buy another pack.  

So thankful that I can finally move on from this terrible habit that has been taking so much of my energy and life for so long.

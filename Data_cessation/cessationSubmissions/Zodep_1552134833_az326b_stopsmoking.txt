6 years!!! Fuck yeah!!!

I almost forgot about the fact I quit smoking. My life has changed and it’s not a thought on the forefront anymore. Good luck to everyone just beginning and those before me.

I’m not sure what I’ll do to celebrate, but I’m excited for another year down.

6 years ago my wife (fiancé at the time) and I moved in to a new house, and decided to try for kids. A month later (4/8/13) we were married and pregnant. My daughter and son have never known me as a smoker and I’m thankful for that.

I wouldn’t give up my time smoking for anything in the world. My grandma and I bonded over cigarette breaks together, I met amazing people out on smoke breaks, and cigarettes really helped me battle depression.

I’m in a better place now. One smoke free day at a time.

PS: I finally put an annual calendar event for myself to remember this day and celebrate it each year.

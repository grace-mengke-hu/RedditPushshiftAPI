Better skin after only 6 days?

I'm 36 years old, damn near 37 (next week) and I've had zits here and there my whole life.  I rarely don't have ANY blemishes.  This morning I noticed I have none.  Not one, anywhere.  Then I realized that last time I remember having perfectly clear skin, it was when I wasn't smoking.  I'm very surprised to see that benefit in only 6 days!

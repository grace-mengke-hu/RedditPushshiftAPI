Even if vapes are harmless, an addiction-free life is worth the pain of quitting (for me)

I’m an ex-cigarette smoker and now am seven days into kicking a 1.5 pod-a-day JUUL habit. I need to constantly remind myself that this is true for me—that sucking on an ecig all day, sneaking into bathrooms and spending $40 a week on pods just to feel an occasional head rush and satisfy constant cravings isn’t worth it. I was resolved on quitting, but with every craving I try to convince myself that ecigs are harmless and that I don’t need to put myself through the agony of withdrawals. I need your help to stay strong and remain convinced that a nictotine-free life is worth the struggle. 

What’s the alternative to quitting now? Every year I postpone it will get harder. Certainly I can’t vape for the rest of my life... 

7 days in the cravings are easier to deal with, but there’s this new feeling of emptiness, like an old friend is missing from my life. Does this feeling ever completely go away? When did it go away for you?

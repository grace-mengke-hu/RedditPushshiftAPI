Was smoke free for over 5 years. Back to day 0.

I started dating a girl who smoked. She kept saying she was going to quit, but eventually we both realized it wasn’t going to happen. We moved in together and have lived together for a month and I ended up caving. It’s not her fault... I won’t ever say it’s her fault. I know she thinks it is. Right now she’s pretty angry with me, but I think it’s because she feels at fault. The argument just makes me want to smoke more just to chill the hell out. I’m disappointed in myself, and I really don’t want her to feel badly or feel at fault. I own my own actions. /rant

Haven't smoked in 4 days and no withdrawals?

smoking a pack a day for months and recently I've tapered off and haven't been able to get cigarettes. I'm a bit confused why I am not experiencing any symptoms of withdrawal. Its a good thing don't get me wrong but what the fuck? I've always heard its hard and you get irritable, but if anything I'm less irritable than I was 4 days ago. Am I just one of those people who isn't affected by nicotine in the same way?

So I hit the 8 week mark without too much fanfare. I wanted to celebrate with a fancy dinner with the SO, but completely forgot about the date (a good sign, perhaps!).

I don't have regular cravings anymore, and not many things trigger my mental 'light one up' pathway. I had a new one recently though; Football (soccer) season is back, and my half time ritual last season was to go out for a quick smoke before anything else. It's interesting the habits I've formed around this damn habit.

The big news is that my gums have been driving me nuts for more than a week now. I can't really describe the feeling, but it's an itch of a sort and I constantly feel like gently pressing my gums and teeth.

I saw my dentist last night and she was incredibly proud of me for having quit smoking! That was a nice pick-me-up. 

She then said it's fairly normal to have issues with the gums and teeth after quitting smoking. The blood circulation around my gums is apparently trying to get back to it's normal state after having been suppressed by the smoke in my mouth earlier. She also warned that I might bleed a bit from my gums, but that I should take it all as incredibly positive signs because my dental health is working towards getting back to pre smoking levels. Isn't nature amazing!?

So yeah, keep at it, everyone. There's bleeding of the gums to look forward to! :D

Thank you all for being such an incredible community. Well done and the very best of luck to everyone making the effort.

Here's a bonus image from the habit tracking app I use (Loop - Habit Tracking on Android). Highly recommended for a visual reminder of the progress you're making.

Help my sister

I'm 17, and my sister's just turned 22. She's in her last year of university, and picked up smoking a bit ago. Idk how long, because I only noticed a few weeks back when she came down to visit us. She comes for a visit every few months or so. The thing is she's in university to become a nurse. She knows how bad smoking is, and I've tried telling her myself but I just don't think she wants to hear it. She's not being ignorant on purpose. She's lovely and very smart, but I can't seem to effect her decisions. I know how horrendously smoking can effect your life. Our grandma died, I believe, due to smoking. I don't want her to negatively change her life. What can I do to get her to stop? 

Thanks

Thanks a lot for the insight. Surprised anyone replied at all. I guess I'll have to talk to her, and find out if there is any desire for her to quit. Thanks again

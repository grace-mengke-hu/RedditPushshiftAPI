28 years old, smoking since 14. Quiting this morning.

Hopefully not gonna fail again, want to quit for my son. Got 2 packs yesterday and was standing in the kitchen and thought enough is enough of this garbage. Poured water in both packs and the lighters. Hopefully the damage isn't already done want to be able to watch this little guy grow up and take take up my bad habits.

Chantix advice?

So, I took my first Chantix pill this morning. They say you can smoke for a week while the medication builds up in your system. Then, on day 8, you should stop.

So, my official quit date is next Friday the 18th. I chose not to hide it and I've told my coworkers, boss and friends and, of course, they're all being really supportive. I HAVEN'T told my family yet because, frankly, they're all smokers and there's a lot of history there. I don't see them that often and I'd like to be well into quitting before I say anything.

Anyway, I was wondering if there's anyone out there that's successfully (Success is key. I don't want to hear from any naysayers) used Chantix and if you had any advice or experiences to share. I've tried to quite before... even had some longish term success. But, this is my first time with Chantix.

TIA!

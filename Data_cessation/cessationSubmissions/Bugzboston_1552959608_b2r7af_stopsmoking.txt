Hoping to be back on track

Took the weekend to regroup. Spent early yesterday morning thinking about what made me smoke again. Biggest factor was the issue with constipation (sorry, don’t mean to gross anyone out). Thought long &amp; hard about my eating habits and realized they were never great to begin with. So, with some of the $ I’m saving from not smoking, I drove over to my local Weight Watchers facility &amp; signed myself up.

Ate fairly well yesterday &amp; today. Tracking everything on their app from a “points” perspective &amp; also using another app which tracks daily calories, carbs, fats, proteins &amp; fiber intake.

Will need to learn how to balance it all out, but finding that having to enter everything in alleviates some of the boredom.

How do you now ‘kill time’?

Looking to get a great collection of ‘time killing’ activities for people to read through/try when those cravings hit hard!

How do you kill time? Whether it be 5 minutes, an hour or a couple of hours! What do you do to distract yourself and smash those cravings away?

Thanks everyone and keep up the great work!

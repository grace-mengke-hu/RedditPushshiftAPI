I need help here, my issue may be a bit different to others

So I can't smoke sober. I absolutely hate the taste of it and the feel and everything else about it. But once I've had a few drinks I'll invariably ask a friend for one, one turns into two, turns into four and I wake up the next day with a sore throat.

I don't know if I'd count as addicted or not considering I can't stand the things when I'm sober. How do I stop my drunk self from wanting a drag?

Thanks for reading.

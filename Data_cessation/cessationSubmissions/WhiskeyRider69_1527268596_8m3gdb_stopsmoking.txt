Unexpected advantage to quitting

I'm middle aged now and dealing with a lot of things that come along with that. A few years ago I noticed these white patches under my eyes. My dad has them too, and I thought it was some inherited thing. One area started growing and looked like an odd pimple, so I got curious and looked it up online. It turns out they are called [xanthelasma](https://www.healthline.com/health/cholesterol-deposits-in-eye#symptoms), and are actually cholesterol deposits. 

This morning, I looked in the rear view mirror of my car and realized that the large one that looked like a big pimple had actually shrunk in size. I looked it up and apparently smoking causes a raise in bad cholesterol and a reduction in good cholesterol. I'd have to go get a test to find out if my cholesterol level has gone down, but this is a great indication that it has since that "pimple" has been steadily getting bigger over the last couple of years. 

Hang in there quitters, we got this!

Need some advice (cigarettes and alcohol)

Hi guys! 

I quit smoking about 4 month ago and I'm feeling great. I even started running to keep my balance. I normally have no cravings for a cigarette at all.  I fall back to old habits when I drink - I drink once a week and then I instantly want a cigarette. 

I wondered if you could get me any advice how to cope with such situations. (despite the obvious stop drinking of course - I'm already trying to keep it at a minimum).

Thanks in advance!

I finally quit smoking.

I just tossed my cigarettes about one minute ago, but I want to try to make it stick.
I figured out how to go to bed by 10PM and to wake with the sunrise, but smoking cessation is hard.
Anyway, I wanted to make it official, maybe get some support. Actually if anybody thinks it might help, I wouldn't mind some prayers. I'll leave it at that.

Thanks Reddit.

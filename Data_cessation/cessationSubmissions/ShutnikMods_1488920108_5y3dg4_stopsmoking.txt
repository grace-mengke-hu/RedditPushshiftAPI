Did you ever feel so bad, that you don't regret anything?

I quit about 80 days ago, nice run i must say, for a man who smoked for a decade.

Today i was with my friends, after a huge MESS happened in my life.

You know, that situation, when everything goes wrong, you accidently become an unreal retard for a while, and just want to wipe out last few days from existance.

So i was hanging out with my friends. Drink. A lot for my standarts.

I'm not a "party" type of a guy, 1-2 beers in 3 months or so is okay for me, but thats all.

Today was vodka + coca cola, i don't really remember how much.

I smoked 3 cigs, and i don't regret it. I needed that for some reason, not because i love to smoke or addiction, or love the process or some shit.

I just wanted to give no fucks to rules, and just relax in the good company, doing exactly what i feel that i want at that moment.

Maybe i'll be sorry tomorrow.

But now, i still consider myself as a non-smoker.

I don't want to. I don't feel i need to. I don't regret about my minute of weakness.

But still i smoked for some reason, so feeled like i must to confess here.

Share my experience or something.

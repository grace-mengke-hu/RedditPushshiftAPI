I feel like a child when I stop smoking.

I know this might sound extremely silly and dumb, but I picked up smoking because I thought it looked mature and fashionable. No one pressured me, I did it by myself. 

At first I liked the feeling of euphoria I got from it, but I don't it anymore so I decided to stop because there is no point if I don't get that feeling.

I stopped as of yesterday. I told my parents that I smoked and they started treating me like an adult (sort of), I'm an 18 year old guy btw. Its like I lost a part of me and Im afraid that no one is gonna take me seriously again. 

Sorry for the rant and thanks for what all of you do here :)

What a difference 49 days make.

I had time to write something down today, so it became 49 days instead of the nice round number of 50 (which is tomorrow!). In addition to being a way for me to put words to this new life I'm experiencing, it will hopefully be motivational for someone out there. 

A special reminder to those of you who are still in the early stages of the first couple of weeks: 50 days is not that far away, believe me. Once you get through those first couple of weeks the clock starts moving at a normal rate again.

First off, 3 common misconceptions about smoking, and how I feel about them today - after 49 days. 

**"I used to think that cigarettes helped me relax."**

When I realized this was bullshit it became one of my main reasons to quit. I wanted to feel what real relaxation was like - as I was pretty sure I hadn't experienced it since I was a child. I got my wish, and it happened about a week ago, when the remaining fog of anxiousness and uncertainty linked to quitting smoking, finally lifted. To be able to sit down after a long day at work, simply sit - without doing anything at all but breathe. WITHOUT that nagging little troll on your shoulder telling you "You should have a cigarette first, it will help you relax". To be able to sit there and finish your thoughts without being interrupted by thoughts of when your next cigarette will be. It's pure freedom, and if I could put it in a jar and send it across the world to all of you who are  struggling so you could get just a small taste of it, I would.    

**"I used to think that cigarettes gave me courage."** 

I no longer need to have a cigarette before doing things, to prepare for things - I simply just go about doing them, whatever they are. I don't delay - and any anxiety I might have felt before doesn't have time to form. When I would tell myself "I'll just have a cigarette first..." I was giving myself some extra time to get anxious. I actually believed that I was anxious about a lot of things, when in reality I'm actually much better equipped at handling stressful situations than I ever thought. It's clear to me now that all that delay I constantly added into my life, coupled with the effects nicotine has on the brain, caused the anxiety I felt I needed relief from. Turns out I had that courage  all along.

**"I used to think that cigarettes helped me concentrate."**

I was the employee who would get irritated if someone talked loudly on the phone in the office next to mine. I wouldn't scream or anything like that (far too introverted for that), but I would let it grow inside of me, until it was ALL I could think about. Whenever I had a difficult task that required deep concentration, which is quite often, I would shut my office door and put on headphones. I'm talking in the past tense here as you can see, as none if this bothers me AT ALL anymore. I can focus intensely on a task while people are constantly chatting on around me, or walking by my office door, running down the stairs with heavy feet, etc. I would work from home at least one day a week so I could get all the really difficult tasks done, while in reality I would take so many smoke breaks throughout the day, that I'm surprised I got anything done. Nowadays I prefer to go to the office almost every day, as it's not longer something I feel is keeping me from getting my job done - on the contrary. And I get a lot more social interaction from this, which doesn't hurt at all.

Most of this is related to one key element of nicotine addiction - the constant distraction of having to think about it ALL THE TIME. This distraction keeps you from being relaxed, and it keeps you from being able to concentrate. A smoker's life is lived between each cigarette, and it consists mainly of waiting for something to happen - and that something is the next cigarette. When that is done, you find things to do until the next one. I'm so happy that I decided I didn't want anything to control my life like that  anymore. Now I get to live my life all the time, and I get to be involved in it while I'm doing so. 

The rest is all those false attributes we assign to smoking. That it somehow makes us better equipped to deal with life. Once you stop, you realize just how much you are capable of on your own. 

None of this says anything about the health benefits, but they are definitely there as well. There are a ton of posts/articles devoted to that already. The effects nicotine has on your brain is sadly not discussed as much, but knowing about it is the key to quitting.

I hardly ever think about smoking at this point - I'm just thinking about the fact that I'm no longer a smoker, and how much of an overall positive thing that is. I find myself making comparisons between my life as a non-smoker and my life as a smoker whenever I'm doing something new. The days go by just as fast as they did when I was a smoker, but they are so much better. I'm more productive, I'm healthier, and I feel hopeful about the future again. I have more courage, I have more confidence. 

**So, you can suck it nicotine! I don't need you, and I sure as hell don't want you.**

Keep it up, everyone! Freedom awaits you all if you want it.

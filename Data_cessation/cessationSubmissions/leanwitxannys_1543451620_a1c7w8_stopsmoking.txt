The beggining of a journey..a good journey! Smoking a pack a day per 6 years and my lungs dont handle cigarettes like "normal lungs" so I just need to stop or im dying at my 30's 35's..im 20 now. Starting again running 5-10km every morning and eating good foods! Thanks for the support guys..amazing.

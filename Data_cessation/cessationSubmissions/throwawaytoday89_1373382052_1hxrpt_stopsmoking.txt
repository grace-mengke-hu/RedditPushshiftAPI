Trying to quit...and I'm a little nervous.

I've been smoking for about 3.5 years now...on and off at first, but consistently for two years. I've been reading this subreddit and some other articles online. I have to admit that I'm nervous about the potential anxiety, depression, and nausea side effects that some reports considering I already have mild anxiety, a history of depression, and IBS. 

I was going to cold turkey it this Friday, July 12th, but my fiance is hesitant and wants to slowly taper down like his mom did.

Any suggestions or comments would be great.

Thanks guys!

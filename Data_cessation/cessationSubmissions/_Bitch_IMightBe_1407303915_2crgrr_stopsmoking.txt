I can't sleep.

I've been smoke free since Sunday, and since then I've laid in bed tossing and turning till about 4 in the morning every night.

In the long run I understand the benefits, but I'm so tempted to go buy a pack so I can finally sleep. This no sleep thing has caused me to sleep in later than I've wanted to which hinders my productivity.

I have an interview tomorrow... Maybe right now isn't a good time to quit smoking.

Somebody please talk some sense into me. I don't want to fail..

My mind is telling me noooo... But my body.. My body is telling me YESSS.

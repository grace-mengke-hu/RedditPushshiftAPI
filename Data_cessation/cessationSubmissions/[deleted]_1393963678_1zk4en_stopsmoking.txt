i'm craving really hard today

i'm 10 days in, everyone said it would get better after 3 days.

they fucking lied holy shit it feels like it's been months since i smoked a cig and i barely made it a week.

someone motivate me because if it wasn't fucking 3 degrees out i'd go out and buy a pack right now. 

EDIT: everyone is fucking smoking cigs on breaking bad they look like they're enjoying it so much holy fuck i hate everyone 

EDIT: it passed after a few cups of coffee and a long shower, alongside reading these posts, thanks everyone!

Has anyone used to Livestrong app to quit smoking?

I started using the Livestrong app a couple weeks ago to help me quit. I have my plan set up so that I give up 3 to 4 cigarettes a week until I am down to 0, and am just now getting to the pony where I have to be conscious of how much I've smoked each day. Dropping from 20 to 13 (or so) has been fairly easy, but I imagine that getting under 10 is where it will start taking a good bit of self discipline 

I guess I am wondering if there is a difference in the physical cravings from going with 2 to 3 cigarettes a day versus cold turkey with a pack a day to none. Does weaning yourself off nicotine prepare your body at all, or am I just delaying the cravings?

I appreciate your input.

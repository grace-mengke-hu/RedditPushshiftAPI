Quit date, monday.

Hey everyone, I tried quitting cold turkey today, no dice though I cracked. So I'm planning to quit this coming Monday. This week just seemed to insurmountable, appointments all week, just overall too many things going on. Next week is chill though, kids will be in school full days no half days like this week, mainly though, I want to make sure I can be successful. Any tips you guys could offer getting ready for this coming Monday? 

My wife and I are trying to better our lives, she's not a smoker but has been working on losing weight and both of us on our dental stuff, as we've let it go for too long.  I hate continuing to smoke as its my part of the bargain to bettering ourselves and I hate feeling like I'm letting her down, as well as risking not being around for the kids in the future as they get older. Anyways, any advice would be good, thanks in advance. :-)

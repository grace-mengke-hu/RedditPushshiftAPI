Mood swings?

Been almost three weeks now, and this is not my first time quitting or comming this far trying to do it. But I'm hoping it's for good this time. I have a history with anxiety and depression, and since I have quit, It seems to be back with a vengeance. Just angry, negative and constantly frustrated... I no longer crave smoking the same way but I want to smoke again for the sole reason that I feel as if I'm being an asshole to everyone, especially my wife. I definitly can't live too long like this it is seriously affecting everything. Can anyone give me some hope on this?

Depression and anxiety, normal?

15 days without smoking and it has been quite easy this time. But I've been very tired and emotional, I've been crying too. What the heck is this? Before quitting I was happier and hardly ever even yawned. I was on Champix for a few weeks, the last few days I took only 0,5mg per day and now I've been without Champix for a few days. 

Do others go through this and when will this end?

Want to quit but cant give it up

This is my first post ever on here, I want to quit smoking and I never do it at home. I just have the hardest time giving it up while at work. I have a few every now and then at work but just can't seem to kick it. Any words of wisdom or tips that worked for anyone would be helpful. Thanks everyone.

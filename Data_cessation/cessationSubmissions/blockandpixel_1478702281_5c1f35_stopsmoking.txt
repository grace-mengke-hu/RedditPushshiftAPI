Vaping is helping me

I have always thought of vaping as a hobby of mine, tinkering with stuff like them and sharing them with friends and family, however of the 3 years I've had them I have smoke cigarettes the entire time. 

Well starting the other day (badge was error-ing and only let me put today for it to work) I have only had my ONE cigarette with my coffee before work (as vaping a peach punch flavor isn't good with a coffee) 

So far so good, and my Wife has cut down as well so that helps me which is good!

anyway I'm rambling. 

cheers to kicking the stinkies!

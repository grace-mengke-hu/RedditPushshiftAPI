Some advice needed; PTSD & quitting

*So I've tried to quit several times, like most smokers i suppose,
but one of the main reasons i keep going back to smoking is related to my ptsd. 

For those who don't know, ptsd or post traumatic stress disorder, 
is in short that you experience one or several traumatic events but the effects don't subside after a couple of weeks/months.*


For me this meant a lot of panic attacks, being suicidal, using substances to reduce the pain.
cigarettes being one of them.

Lately I've been in some calmer waters, don't regularly have panic attacks and i no longer feel suicidal.
I thought that would make a perfect time to quit, go to the next step of improving my life. 

However this turned out not to be the case, the moment i quit i get massive panic attacks that last for hours, if not days with some pauses in between. Last week i quit for ~5 days, caved in after i couldn't really take it anymore.


My question to Reddit is, what would be the best course of action in my situation? 

*What steps could i take to lessen the blow or in the mindset department 
[couldn't think of another way to put it] prepare for when quitting in advance.*

That's what I've been missing?

  

Today at lunch, I delivered meals to folks who cannot leave their home. Several of the recipients smoked and at least one person had a cigarette burning while I dropped off the food. The smell of smoke was overpowering. I almost gagged. I coughed when I got outside. All I could think was, ***THAT’S*** what I’ve been pining for? That smell? That stink?

I realized I haven’t missed a thing but a terrible stench, desperation and addiction.

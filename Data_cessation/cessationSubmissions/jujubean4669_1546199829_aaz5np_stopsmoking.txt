4 days in! Cough is nearly gone!!

Just freaking happy. 4 days, six hours and 40 minutes into this quit, and sang an amazing concert this morning.  After quitting for 15 years, I relapsed a few years ago, quit last January, and relapsed again in June.  I’d been fooling myself for six months or so, pretending that I could actually smoke, sing, play tennis, and run just fine. Right. Not. Caught a really bad cold in October, followed by another in late November, and sounded like I was hacking up body parts by early December. I knew I smelled like crap, had lost my true sense of smell and taste, was completely overcome with guilt and shame, and really worried that I would have this fuc**** monkey on my back forever.  The day after Christmas morning, I was up at 5 am, craving a cigarette, and had the house to myself—by 7 am had smoked three already. I paced my house, frustrated as f***, feeling shitty and guilty, and then I just said, f*** this, grabbed my pack, ran it under the kitchen faucet and threw those mother fu**ers in the trash.  I got through the first two days using a 14mg patch, started the 21mg yesterday. This is how I did it before; I can and will get this monkey off my back for good.  Will this be easy? Nope. I’m a realist; I know there will be days when my resolve will be tested. But today?  I. Am. A. Non-smoker. Hell yeah. Bring it. I’ve got this.

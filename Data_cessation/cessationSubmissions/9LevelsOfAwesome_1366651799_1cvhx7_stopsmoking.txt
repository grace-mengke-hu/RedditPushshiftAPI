Dippers often get over looked in light of smokers so I come here looking for advice.

I used to be a 2 tin & 2 pack a day nicotine sponge in the military. Over the last few years I've toned it down to 1/2 - 1 tin a day and my e-cig. I'm trying to work in nofap with the betterment of my health and nicotine is the worst of it right now.

Any ex-dippers in here?

Truth be told I really want to know if anyone has noticed an increase in cognitive function after the nicotine is gone. I know I'm smart at at 25 I'm confident it's not going away and I suspect my nicotine addiction to be in the way.

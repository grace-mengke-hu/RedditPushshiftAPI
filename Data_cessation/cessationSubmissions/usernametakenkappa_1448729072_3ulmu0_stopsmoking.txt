Want advice for helping someone.

I rent a room in a house, and the roommate who lives in the basement smokes. I'm concerned it comes up because I can smell it sometimes. It's also bothersome because the washing machines are in the basement and everytime I do laundry, it ends up with a smokey smell. 

This has been going on since I've been here, for almost a year now. I haven't complained a lot because I'm worried he'll get stressed by the pressure of quitting and smoke more, but I'm really tired of it, and I'm considering moving out because of it.  I don't want my health to be damaged by living with a smoker.

What can I do to get him to quit? I was thinking of getting him an eCig, and a book. Should I explain how much I really hate the smoking, even if it will stress him out?

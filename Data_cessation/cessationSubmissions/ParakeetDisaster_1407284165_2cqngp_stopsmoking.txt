Still struggling a bit

So I finally made it to a month, but I was surprised by the intensity of the cravings I got after switching from the 21mg patches to the 14mg.   
  
I decided to revisit my first post and remind myself of how I felt when I started this, at a time when it was undeniably harder than it is now. This is the longest I've gone without smoking in at least 8 years, so I'm definitely not giving this up!  
  
Thanks for the support! Stay strong.

Just quit today

I have tried quitting before but it never really worked out for me before.
This time might be different though.
a few weeks ago i decided i did not want to smoke on my 23rd year so i was going to quit sometime before my birthday (witch is today) that was all good and well but i did not really have any faith in my ability to quit.
Then last Monday something changed 
i was in a car crash doing 90km (about 55 mph) and rolled 3 times 
everyone was mostly alright but something in me clicked 
i suddenly knew i was going to stop smoking because i want to live.
I am usually a lurker but something compelled me to share this.
Anyways enough rambling i wish you all the best of luck in your attempts.
Have a good day :D

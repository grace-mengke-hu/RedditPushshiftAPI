Did I smell like that, too?

Friend of mine in a college course with me (ironically, the one that enabled me to pick up smoking again in the first place about two months ago) just came into class and sat down next to me. He absolutely reeked of cigarettes. I'm only 22 days clean but DAMN! I am so happy to not smell like that anymore!

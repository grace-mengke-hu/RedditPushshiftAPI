24 hours and counting...

I quit smoking yesterday around 2.30PM, around the same time it is now.

I actually took advantage of the fact I'm sick because it makes me want to smoke less, so I'm feeling great so far about no smoking, not so great about the fact I have a fever, but it should get better. 

I hope this works, this is my first try.

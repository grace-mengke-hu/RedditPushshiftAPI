Tough night

I don't even really want to smoke, but I've conditioned myself over years to think that maybe I would feel better if I had just one. Blah! My relationship isn't going well and he says I'm just being manipulative and usually that's correct but I did not really one want for the last 4 days then he came home. I'm really considering ending the relationship, I am so much more productive when he's not around. I just wasted 4 hours arguing, thought we got to a good place and worked out, then he just kept going. I'm trying to explain there has to be a natural end to the fight but he says that's when he wants it to end, not when we've discussed everything! As much as I'd like to I can't fix his emotional issues, and he puts them all on me. Thanks for letting me vent.

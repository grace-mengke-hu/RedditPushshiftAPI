Cut back by watching Mad Men.

Ok, I know that Mad Men doesn't go out of its way to be anti-smoking... But with that being said, Don Draper is shown smoking on screen less and less as the series progresses. If you set the rule that you can only smoke when he does, you can taper off from several cigarettes in an evening down to about 1 or 2. I've been watching the series on Netflix with these rules and I've cut back on evening smoking pretty significantly. Just food for thought though. I know tapering off isn't for everybody. Also, it isn't until around season 3 where he really cuts back.

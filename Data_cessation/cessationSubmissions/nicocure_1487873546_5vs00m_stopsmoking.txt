Felt weird this morning

I drank quite a bit yesterday and woke up with a hangover. The weird thing happened when I took my first breathe consciously. Air flowed in just fine, my throat wasn't sore and I didn't feel the urge to cough. 

That was totally unexpected as I used to chain smoke when I drank and always woke up with messed up lungs and throat.

Glad to get back to the non smoker hangovers :)

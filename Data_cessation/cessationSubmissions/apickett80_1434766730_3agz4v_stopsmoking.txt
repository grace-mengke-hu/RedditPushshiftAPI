I'm back after a couple years.

I quit smoking a couple years ago for 5 months. I felt amazing, was able to breath better, and all that good stuff. Screwed up and started back. I have not had a cigarette since about 1:00 this morning (almost 20 hours). Have been going through the withdrawals but have been doing good at riding them out. Just wanted to come for some support.

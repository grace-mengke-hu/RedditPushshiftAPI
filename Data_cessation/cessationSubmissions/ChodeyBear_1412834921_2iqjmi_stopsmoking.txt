I am craving like a bitch recently

I don't know whether it's the seasonal shift or the fact that I'm in week 3 after stepping patches down (as week 3 seems to be a tough spot for me), but I've had substantially more cravings over the last 3 or 4 days. I don't know what to do or where to go. I'm starting to look forward to just being rid of the nicotine - my nurse is stepping me down a bit too slowly maybe. 

Anyway. I would like to add that I don't need a lecture from the die hard cold turkeyers out there - I know I'm dragging out the process but it's easing me in and this is how I personally feel I have the best chance of success. I have read allen carr, yes.

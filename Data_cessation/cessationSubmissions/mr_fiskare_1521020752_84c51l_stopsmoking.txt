Resetting the counter on day 128

Last summer I made a decision and put down smoking. Things went quite easy, I started excercising and swimming. My life improved a lot! Then I had the toughest period of my life so far but it didn't make me light up one even. Everything went fine.

In December my friend came over and brought some weed from Amsterdam. I was like 'Meh.. does it even count?'. So I didn't refused. Yet again this was around Christmas. After that single joint I made a habit and smoked one from time to time. It was not effecting me emotionally at all. I thought it's going to be fine if I don't smoke regular cigs. It was a mistake.

Back in February I visited Budapest for a day. It was such a lovely weather that it made me think about the time I was a smoker. Stopping at various spots, enjoying the landscape and a spliff. So I went to the nearest tobacco shop and grabbed a pack of Marlboro. How stupid isn't it? I smoked the whole pack and hasn't stopped since than. 

It is hard to reliase how quick you can fall back and how long you have to fight yourself before getting ready to quit again. In the last three weeks I had several attempts to do so and all failed. I have trash feelings about myself but I'm at day two as I write my story so I'm back in the game baby. All I can tell to everyone who had fallen back, don't you even think that's over. You can always start fresh and it will be always the smarter decision. Don't let cigarettes wash your brain.

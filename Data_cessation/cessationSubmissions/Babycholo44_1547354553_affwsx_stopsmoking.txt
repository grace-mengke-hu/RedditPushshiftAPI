Starting to smell things again

My last cigarette was on 10/6/18, but I was smoking weed (blunts) up until late November. Of course I could smell a lot of strong smells during this time, but now I'm finally starting to be able to pick up on those slightly delightful (and some nasty) smells. I was making a kale salad earlier and couldn't help but think how bad it smelled lol still tasted good though. It's getting better and better

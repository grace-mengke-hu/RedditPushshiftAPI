I want to share a tip that helped me.

I've tried giving up smoking a number of times but it hasn't worked for me yet. However I've cut down A LOT, from half a pack a day to one or two.

Whenever I want to smoke, I still go to my favorite spot and light one. But at the same time, I eat an apple. It sounds weird, I know, but hear me out. There's something about the sweetness and health aspect of an apple that completely conflicts with the taste and pleasure I get from a cigarette. The apple tastes so much better than the cigarette; it's disgusting and so am I and I want to change that. It's even worse when I have a menthol american spirit instead of the usual marlbred (not a huge fan of the minty apple carcinogen flavor). Idk im tired fuck me just thought some people might want to give it a shot goodnight

A night out

I had a night out yesterday. For me that has been the most dangrous situation related to smoking. Many times I have been smokefree for weeks only for forgetting it all after some alcohol and just restarts my habits and addiction . So how did it go this time? Now in the time of writing, because of lot and lots of alcohol yesterday, my brain have a hard time to remember yesterday very clear.  But I am about 95 percent sure I did not smoke a single cigarette. For that I am very happy. That is the one true confirmation for me that I am not a smoker. I am not an addict anymore....And if I did smoke some green stuff outside a reggae place, that is something else and does not count...

4 Months in...

I had the worst craving not but just a few minutes ago. I could picture myself going to the corner, getting some cigs and a lighter, opening the noisy cellophane and ripping off the foil. I felt the cigarette in my mouth as I struck the lighter and took the first drag. I felt my head get light and my body woozy as the nicotine and tobacco fills my lungs.

As fast as it came, it was gone. To another 136 days.

One smoke a day

45 days ago I was smoke free for a month. Due to dizziness I started to smoke two a day to see if it would help. I am still having dizzy spells with no explanation. All tests have come back normal. ALL of them. I did a dramatic cut back and then quit cold turkey. Now I'm afraid to give up this one smoke a day... but I also think it may stop the dizziness.

Resolve wearing thin

Ugggghhhhh I'm scared, you guys. I feel like I'm being worn down by the smoking monster. I feel like I'm getting weaker by the day. I'm having smoking nightmares, where I give in, and I get so upset with myself. I picked up someone's pack of smokes in my hand and it just felt so natural... I got super scared and threw it back on the table and left the room. I just feel like I'm going to crack.

BUT. I. WILL. NOT. FUCKING. CRACK.

That is the little cigarette demon, tormenting me. That little fucker WANTS me to crack. Fuck him. Fuck big tobacco. Fuck emphysema and all that nasty shit that comes along with smoking. Maybe if I get mad it'll help?

Gah.

Questions

So I am currently ready "Quit Smoking Easy" by Allan Carr that I have seen recommended here a few times. He makes good points and it says keep smoking till I finish the book, which I'm half way through. I'm eager to quit. But I have some concerns. 


My husband smokes and makes no motion to stop. I'm worried about being around him and second had smoke making it harder to get off nicotine completely. I know that sounds crazy but I have noticed even when I'm not smoking, if he is near by then I don't really have a need to smoke because I can smell it from his cigarette. Is this a legitimate concern I need to look out for and discuss with him?

Also does anyone have any little tips and tricks to calm the coughing? My sister in law read the book and she quit 6 days ago. Says the coughing is pretty bad at first.

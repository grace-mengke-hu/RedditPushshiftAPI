Completely Exhausted and Depressed after 4 Months

It has not been like this for all 4 months.  Most days have been good and cravings have not been that bad overall.  I have had about 12 difficult days in 4 months, and most were in the 1st two weeks. I got through them all one day at a time, but now I am feeling dead tired, especially in the mornings and afternoons.  I almost fall asleep driving into work!  I have been sleeping great, but I can't keep my eyes open after 9:30, which is weird, and I am up at 5:30 every morning.  I have also felt very depressed this last week.  I quit last year for 4 1/2 months, and the same thing happened.  Both times I quit cold turkey with Alan Carr and Why Quit.  I was in such a fog after 4 1/2 months last year, I could not work and started smoking again.  I am afraid the same thing is happening.  Anyone experience anything similar?

I didn't save money by quitting, i did much more.

I made a sum of my tobacco-related expenses.

first, know that i smoked exclusively hand-rolled cigs, which in my country costs far less than classic cigarettes.

it turns out that i bought every two weeks a pot of tobacco (100 grams) and 4 filters packs / 4 rolling paper packs. total per  months : 70€

the smokes were for my wife and myself .

So, i've spent 770€ since the beginning of the year in tobacco, for 2 smokers. Now i don't smoke anymore, but my wife still does, she prefers pre-rolled cigs and don't want to stop right now (not a problem for me). i predict a monthly expense of 70€ (around 9-10 packs a month).

in the end, the fact that i stopped smoking won't change the tobacco expenses.

Why am i telling you this? Even if you have trouble finding a good reason to stop, know that even money don't have to be your main concern.

Be concerned by your health, first of all. i'm still young, didn't have much trouble with that, but i thought about the future.

Be aware that you're another slave of that industry, and nobody would like to be a slave.

Keep in mind that the only thing you smoke is some poison which tells your brain that you'll need one more dose later, and for the meantime, give you a  fake feeling of relaxation.

I stopped because i've had enough. Smoking in the morning, smoking at work, smoking at home, i've lost my freedom to live normally because of my addiction.

I stopped to be myself again .

Keep going friends !

Normally I don't celebrate after 1 day, but since I was a secret smoker, I have to tell someone! I quit! Woooooo!

Pretty much that. Using Alan Carr's method. It's probably the 5th time I've read the book, and this time I really gave myself time to let it sink in rather than rushing through it as fast as I can.

Failure sucks, especially because it robs you of your confidence. But Alan Carr's way is better than any way I know. Plus, every time I attempt it it DOES work for months, the problem is not letting myself get stupid enough to think I can have "just one".

Anyway, I feel confident that this will be my last "attempt". Wish me luck!

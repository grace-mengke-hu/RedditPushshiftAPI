10 days! no nicotine patch/gum, very few cravings!

I'm on 10 days today! Having almost no cravings any more! 

Accidental side-effects of quitting: 
-I'm sleeping better (just this is enough to keep me off, I have trouble sleeping in general) 
-I'm drinking less coffee; I used to think I smoked with coffee because I liked how it went together, turns out I may have been making coffee just to have an excuse to go out for a smoke 
-I'm more energetic (also has to do with the sleep) 

I love it!! I can't wait to hit a month, and then 6 months, etc. :-D

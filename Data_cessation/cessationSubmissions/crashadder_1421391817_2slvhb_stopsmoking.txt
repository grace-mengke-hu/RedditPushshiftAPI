2 months today

I thought i'd step in and summarize the last 2 months for new quitters. It might help. First 3 weeks which most people think that is the hardest period of the progress was ridiculously easy for me. Although its all about getting rid of the physical addiction, most of the feelings are still the reason of mental addiction. I cant believe all the posts i am reading here about how much it hurts. Its all in your mind trust me. I even enjoyed the process a lot. Try to visualize the poison leaving your body .Drink plenty of water and relax. Its that substance that made us a slave for all those years. the saddest thing is that we didnt get anything in return. I can honestly say now that if some company find a permanent cure for all the diseases smoking causes i'd still not get back to it. Because it seems stupid to light something and put it in your mouth and exhale smoke. seriously it seems pretty unnatural to me. Anyways after 3 weeks things started to get a little bit harder for me .The reason to that was mainly because being friends with stupid people. One of my ex-smoker friend  blew smoke  on my face . He said he was stress testing me. :-) I was  3 weeks into the attempt that this particular asshole recorded my speech which i was talking about how i didnt use any willpower to quit and that i was quite happy etc.. He said he'd use it against me when i finally cave in. I dont know the psychology behind it but for a week or so i've had hard days. It seemed everyone around me were waiting for me to fail. So my advice no matter how cheerful you are about quitting, try to keep it to yourself and this sub. and read allen carr's the only way to stop smoking. longer than the easy way but more effective . English is clearly not my first language. Sorry if you had to struggle to understand what i meant.

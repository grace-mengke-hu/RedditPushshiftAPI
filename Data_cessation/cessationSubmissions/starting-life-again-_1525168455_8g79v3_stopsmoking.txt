What's your opinion on shisha?

I was out with some friends the other day and all of them smoke except me. Over drinks one of them ordered a shisha water pipe and everyone had a few hits. I didn't feel like smoking and I haven't smoked at all since but I'm just curious to know what everyone thinks. Is this the same as smoking?

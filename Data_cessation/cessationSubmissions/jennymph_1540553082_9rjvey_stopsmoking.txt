Really. Want. A. Ciggie.

So I've been cigarette free for a week now and man, it's been great. I used to smoke around 20-25 a day for 8 years. Vaping with low nicotine so I think this might be my issue but overall enjoying my vape. I really, really want one cigarette but I know that once I make that decision and have one, I might as well have not quit smoking in the first place. In a proper tug of war with addiction right now :( Just wanted to write that down.

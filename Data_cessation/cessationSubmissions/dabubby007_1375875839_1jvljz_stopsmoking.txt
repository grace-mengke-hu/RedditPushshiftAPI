Me smoke? In my dreams!

Every 2 to 3 months I have a dream where I end up smoking and I immediately feel ashamed for it and relief when I realize it was a dream.  Even after 4 years I still get the itch to smoke... then I remember the money saved and the nasty smell and it passes.  Anyone else have simular experiences?

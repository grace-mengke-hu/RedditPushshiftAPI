6 months!

I can't believe it's already been this long! This is by far the longest I have ever gone without smoking, my previous record was 3 or 4 months. After smoking for eight years I am so happy to have quit. 


To those thinking of quitting for the new year, why not try it now? I initially had planned to quit after Canada day (I wanted to be able to party, drink, and smoke) but ended up saying fuck it and quit a few days prior with nearly a full deck of smokes left. Never looking back.


Best of luck to quitters new and old!

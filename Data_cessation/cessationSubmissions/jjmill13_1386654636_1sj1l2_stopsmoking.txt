Giving it another shot.

Hey all. I've totally done one of these posts before, but so be it.

Tonight I found a weird lump under the skin of my neck which induced a panic attack. It's probably a swollen gland or lymph node, or it could be another cyst (I had one in high school, it was not really a big health concern and got it removed in a really quick and simply surgery) but nevertheless, my hypochondriac mind immediately went "CANCER CANCER CANCER." So I realized if I am such a hypochondriac and so terrified of getting cancer why in the hell am I a smoker?

And with realizing that money I'm spending on cigarettes could easily be spent on other things I want but can't buy because of my habit, and realizing that having AS puts me at risk for drug addiction, and hating the smell of my own clothes, and having almost no friends who smoke anymore, and so many other things, I knew I had to try quitting again. I have an e-cig in case of cravings but I hope I don't ever really need it. 

Positive vibes, please. And I'll definitely be lurking here more often.

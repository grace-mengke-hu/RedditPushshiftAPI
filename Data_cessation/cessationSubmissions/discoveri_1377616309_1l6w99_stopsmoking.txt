Smoke dreams

Last night I had a dream that I was going to go and buy a pack of smokes. Usually this sort of dream ends with me smoking and feeling really guilty until I get it through my head that it was a dream. However, in this dream, I actually argued with myself and ended up buying gum and milk duds instead. I kinda feel like I accomplished something for being able to turn down smoking in a dream.

0 mg E-Juice

I went from smoking to vaping, to quitting, to smoking, then to vaping again. I'm back to the quitting stage and I'm determined to make this one work. How many of you used 0 mg juice to tone down cravings, and if so, how well did it work. I can't imagine it'd help very much, but I'm about to reach day 2 and I'm desperate to find anything to help.

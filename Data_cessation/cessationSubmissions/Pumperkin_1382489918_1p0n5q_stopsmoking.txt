Day 1 - almost over!

Smoker for over 16 years here (32 now, started dabbling as a young teen, got heavy at driving age), making an honest effort to quit.  Was up to about a pack and a half per day, up until now.  Or yesterday, as it were.  Tried to go cold turkey in the past, the most recent non-success being a couple weeks ago.  

A few things that are motivating me:
1. Money - seriously, who hates having more money?
2. Health - I have 2 young children I would like to see grow up.  I don't seem to have much energy now to keep up, and that makes me sad.
3. NRT - this helps me not to smoke.  Everyone has their own way, the gross gum is mine.
4. Friends!  I know a few people who have quit that I thought never would.  One is a childhood buddy, we got hooked together :p  Another is currently in the process of quitting, I think we can help each other much.
5. Time - I used to do things besides smoke.  I also think I used to enjoy doing other things without thinking about when I could smoke next, but it's been so long I don't actually remember.
6. Smell - I don't smell like smoke very much lately.  My car is almost bearable, to the point where I would carry non-familial types as passengers.  I like it.

So here we go!  I have exactly 24 hrs under my belt...... now.  Feel free to offer up advice, encouragement, insults, etc.  It's going to be a long and bumpy ride.

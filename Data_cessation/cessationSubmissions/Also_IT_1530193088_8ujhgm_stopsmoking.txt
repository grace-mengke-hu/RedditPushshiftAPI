"Former Smoker"

So, 10 days after my last cigarette, I had a doctor's appointment. While the nurse was with me, checking my vitals and asking questions, she asked, "have there been any changes to your lifestyle or medications?" I said, "Well, I quit smoking 10 days ago. I don't know how long you have to have not smoked to 'have quit', though so..." She gave me a blank look, turned to her computer began typing and said out loud, "former smoker."
That was the best feeling I'd had in a long time. Just though I'd share :)

Quit almost 60 days ago, this is the worst its been

The past week has been terrible. I wasn't ready for this. When I first quit I knew what to expect the first couple weeks and I prepared myself for it. It sucked but I got myself through it. 

Now the cravings are just as bad and I'm in a crappier point in life now than I was when I first decided to quit. I don't want to smoke and I've been trying to remind myself of the benefits and what I've been able to do as a nonsmoker. All I want to do is think it over while I'm having a smoke. 

Everyone thinks that I've quit and that it's a done deal. That I haven't smoked in two months so its over. I can't even bring myself to tell anyone that quitting smoking is why i'm in a bad mood or why i'm upset because it sounds so ridiculous and pathetic. 

I feel like a useless piece of shit. I graduated college last may. I had a badass job offer that was supposed to start in December. I moved back home and pretty much did odd jobs here and there for the summer and fall. Then due to a recession in the industry the company decided to push my start date back to January. Alright, great, get to spend the holidays with my family. Then it was February. Now its April. I've been looking for other jobs to start a career but I can't even decide on something that I would rather do.

I was on cloud nine, I had quit smoking, had an awesome job to look forward to, and everything was going good. Now I've been going to doctors appointments with my dad for stage four cancer clinical trials, I have a job offer that may or may not ever come through and I've wasted 9 months of my life, I can't decide on what else I would do with my life, and all i want is a god dam cigarette.

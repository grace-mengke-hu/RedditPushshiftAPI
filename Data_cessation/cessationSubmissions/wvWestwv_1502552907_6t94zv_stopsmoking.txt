My Quit Story(4 weeks)

TL:DR I quit smoking and you can too.

After smoking an average of a pack a day for 17 of my 34 years I have just made it to the 4 week mark. 

I made it this far by:
1. Setting a quit date(the day of a tooth extraction)
2. Exercising/meal planing(I still put on a few but have since lost them) surprise! smoking burns calories
3. Using a combo of patches and gum to address the physical addiction.
4. Mentally, I fixated on the money I would save from not purchasing smokes as well as lessening my health risks. 

Honestly, the physical habit was way easier to break for me than I ever thought it would be. That said, my biggest issues started to arise when I started to reduce my use of gum/patches. I had increased anxiety, depression  and was acting like a major jerk. I had a few incidents of near dangerous rage and could tell that those around me were getting sick of my shit. Ultimately I decided to take some sick time off of work/people(created a 4 day weekend) to get over the hump and be done with the NRT. It worked for me and as of yesterday I'm over the 4 week mark from smoking and 2 weeks since I had a piece of gum. I can finally feel my brain chemistry improving and I gotta say it's pretty sweet to not feel like a madman. 

Not seeking any praise, just want to share for anyone who may be going through it too. It does get better.

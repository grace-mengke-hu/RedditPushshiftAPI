24 days and made it through almost every trigger situation.

I have not smoked while:

-drinking
-hanging out with my friend who is a heavy smoker
-going out to a bar
-at a wedding
-grilling in the back yard
-talking on the phone
-stressed out/angry about something
-at night "to relax" after dinner

These are most of the situations where I would normally have lit up a few times per week, and depending on the situation, I would have smoked anywhere from 1 to half a pack or more. And now that I'm reading through them, I can see that my self-labeling as a "social smoker" was not very accurate anymore, since half of these situations could involve being alone.

I've had some pretty strong cravings for someone who wasn't a heavy smoker. I don't know how you pack a day folks do it, but kudos to you!

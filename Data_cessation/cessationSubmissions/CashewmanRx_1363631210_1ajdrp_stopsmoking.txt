The obligatory 6 MONTH OMG YEA

Seriously 6 months and I could not be happier, I feel better than I ever have.

I cant tell you how many attempts it took, probably 3 years of quitting on and off until it finally kicked in. Never again will I go back. 

If you think you cannot do it, you are making excuses, anyone can, and it is one of the easiest and best things you will ever do in your life.

GOOD LUCK TO ALL OF YOU IM JUST AS PROUD OF THE DAY ONES AS I AM OF THE DAY ONE-EIGHTY-ONES

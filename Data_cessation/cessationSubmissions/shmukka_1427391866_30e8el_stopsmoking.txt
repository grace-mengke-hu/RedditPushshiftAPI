Day 5 - Cold Like Symptoms

Today is my day 5. I'm handling the cravings like a boss, hopefully it stays that way. Anyways, I'm starting to cough, sneeze/runny nose - but read its a good sign. But I haven't read anyone getting this on this subreddit. Am I the only one? Or could this just be a coincidental cold symptoms?

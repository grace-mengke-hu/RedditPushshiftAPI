I've never posted here before but I need to quit and I'm looking for support!

I'm 26 and have been smoking on and off for 8 years. During my pregnancy with my youngest child, I quit smoking and had 2 years smoke free under my belt. 

Unfortunately the last month or so I've started up again with a vengeance. It started while hanging out with smoking friends one evening, and has progressed to half a pack a day, which doesn't sound too bad except it's twice as much as I used to smoke. 

My problem is, smoking has made me so much happier. The last two years I've been a miserable irritable person. Now I have infinite patience, I'm more calm, I'm happier. I've been more social- for the first time I've started becoming friends with my neighbours because we're all outside smoking. Ive lost all the weight I gained when I quit and feel better about how I look.

But I know I need to quit. I have horrible asthma and my lungs hurt all the time. I had to stop my daily jog because my lungs couldn't keep up. My dr keeps warning me that this is gonna kill me sooner rather than later because my lungs are so damaged. I've tried all the "quit smoking" tools- nicotine gums and sprays and mints. I can quit cold turkey and go months without a smoke and then suddenly start up again. 

This will be my 6 time trying to quit. I'm not sure what I'm looking for here- support maybe? Or advice? Has anyone else quit this many times and finally been successful? I'm honestly feeling like such a failure and don't know where to go from here. Thank you for reading my mini rant!

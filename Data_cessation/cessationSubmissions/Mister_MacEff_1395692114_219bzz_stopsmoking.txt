Why is it so fucking hard?

I bought another pack today.

I even went all day yesterday without a cigarette.

I can't afford this goddamn habit for so many reasons. I'm a freshman in college with almost no money. Two of my grandparents died from lung cancer, both of them lifetime smokers. These fucking things are straining my relationship with my parents.

I already know all this, but I still can't stop myself from running down to the store and grabbing a pack.

I could blame it on my medication because it amplifies my cravings. I could blame my friends for making me want to smoke. 

But that's bullshit and we all know it.

If I don't quit soon, I never will. I shouldn't have let myself come this far; but it's a hole I dug for myself, and I have to crawl out of it.

I really am sick of this.

Seems I can’t quit

Hello fellow quitters, long time lurker here, first post so I’d like to share with you my story in this filthy habit.  I have been smoking since I was 10 ( and no!, I do not come from that type of low family, both parents academicians, but I became a f***g Ninja hiding from them), first taught of quitting came in the 8th grade, managed to stay off for about a year than I bounced back... fast forward some decades, I realized  I’m sort of bipolar: every time I quit that monster keeps coming back to me in a form or another... a death of smb, a great financial loss, child loss etc... I always manage to identify the precise moment I’ll start smoking again yet I don’t do anything about it, I just light on more. Today I decided and this is my promise to the INTERNET, that if i’ll ever touch one more cigar, all my life savings will go a place of your choice. I will pick a badge tonight, as i never had one :D “excited”, and if the dark day will come (most likely it will knowing me) I will come back here with all the $$$ for the African/Kids/Diseases you guys will wish to donate! So help me God

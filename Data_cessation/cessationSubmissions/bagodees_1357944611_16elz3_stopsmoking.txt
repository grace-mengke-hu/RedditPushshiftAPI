60 days, so happy

I feel great! I didn't plan on quitting when I did, I just did it. Didn't read the book, used an ecig maybe 3 times during the first week. I think my success has been from just making the decision to not smoke.  Hardest part has been when drinking with friends that smoke, but it wasn't that bad. I didn't tell anyone that I was quitting and nobody really noticed until after a few weeks. My wife is still smoking - I can't believe how bad she smells and how bad I must have smelled when I was smoking. Just last night I noticed that the cat smelled like cigarettes after my wife had been petting him. Ugh. Fortunately we never smoked in the house, but it's like Pigpen from Charlie Brown when she comes back inside from smoking.

This isn't the first time I've quit, but I'm going to try my hardest to make sure it's the last. This subreddit has been a tremendous help. It's nice to read about other people methods to curb the cravings and avoid the triggers as well as give encouragement to my fellow quitters. Keep quitting them smokes, my fellow internet buddies!

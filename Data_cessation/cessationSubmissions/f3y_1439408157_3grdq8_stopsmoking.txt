Just realized that I reached 2 months!

I haven't felt the need to come here for a while, so I didn't notice that my counter is at 64 days! Whoo!

Since my day 1 I've used this sub as a stop smoking aid and you guys have been tremendously helpful. When I was craving fierce, I'd come here and lurk until it got better. Eventually I needed to come here less and less and well, I'm doing so well now that I missed my own two month mark!

Thank you guys. :)

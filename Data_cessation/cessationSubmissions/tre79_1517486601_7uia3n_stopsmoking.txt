Wake up call

I have smoked for 20 years.  My mother (who is a smoker) suffered a slight stroke after Christmas.  To see how her biggest fear was the doctors telling her she should give up smoking was a huge wake up call for me.  Just how foolish and how the addiction makes you such a slave to it.   It made me sad for her sad for myself.  Smoking effects everyone that loves you!  This is not something I am willing to have my children worry about.  29 days smoke free today.   I feel great and am hoping just by example, not criticism I can show others itâ€™s worth it!!  All my best to everyone on the path.

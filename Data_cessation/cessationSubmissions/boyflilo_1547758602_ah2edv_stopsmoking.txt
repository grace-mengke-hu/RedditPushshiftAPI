Note1: forgive my English
Note2: am new so I hope my my post falls in the context of this community and respects the rules (I read them briefly)

Am 30yo Male I have  been smoking for 11 years, with weed included for the last 2 years(1 pack and 5 jnts a day ). Unfortunately i smoke with love " as I call it "  like every other thing in my life eaither it's good or bad I do it with an extra mile.... but still I hated it , read a book " the easy way " searched online for an easy way " like there is one"

I tried many times to stop &amp;I  never made it for 24h.

So I got obsessed with why can't I stop . Something must be wrong somewhere ( am I not wired to do what I wanna do)  so I went back to the internet and  all the things had one meaning in my mind (based on the image I have about my self ) it's that I won't change until it gets me to the hospital or something like that.

5 months ago  I had a problem at work things were bad I had to smoke more weed  to relax. the more  i smoke the more unrelaxed I became that night I decided(unplaned)to stop weed cigarettes and coffee it took every drop of well and focus i had, combined with rage and self hate it's like  I knew I would fail so I put everything on it along the way I felt free. But I had nothing to do afterwork I live far from home so after 4 months I started drinking till a month ago when I relapsed and rolled back to it   except this time I ended up with no desire to do anything or improve my life and I don't know what to do about it anymore. 

It's a strange new feeling I never experienced before it's like am empty  or maybe the  flame evryone have that keeps them  pushing is no longer there in me .

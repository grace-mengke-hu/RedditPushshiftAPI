Oh-oh. I didn't realize I set my goal of quitting so close

Okay. So I've decided to turn my life around, eat healthier, loose some weight work out more and to stop smoking. I started this healthier life around two months ago, and I told myself that I would quit smoking when I hit 75 kg. I was 87 kg so it seemed like it was reasonable. 

Here is the big issue for me; I've lost  weight way more quick then I thought (witch is nice). Today I remembered I should weigh myself and I'm  down to 76.8. 

At this rate I will be 75 by next week. I don't feel prepared, and thought it would take atleast a couple of more months to get where I want to be. My question to you people; do you think I should stick with my plan, and a week of cutting down will be enough or be a bit more "slacky" with myself and cut down under a longer period (say a month or two weeks or.. I don't know)? Right now I'm doing 14-16 fags aday:S

I am going to stop smoking, but I'm afraid I will start again.

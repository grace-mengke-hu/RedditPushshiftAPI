In the dumps, should I stop now?

Hi all.

It's been fascinating reading this tread. It's giving me so much hope reading all your stories. I feel like hugging all of you. 

I have been going through a serious bout of depression for 3 months now. I'm also borderline and going through a sort of 'break up'. 

Last night I smoked a whole pack of cigarettes and today I skipped work to stay home and smoke weed. Bad idea. I just came down from a panic attack and I'm in a deep dark place. 

More than anything I really want to quit smoking. I feel I lack in willpower though. I'm not sure why, I'm incredibly disciplined with some things but I just cave in and have a cigarette even when I don't want to. Sometimes I tell myself I'll just have one to remind myself I don't like it..lolll...do you guys do that too?

 I was down to 2 a day only on weekdays until I got depressed but after last night I'm determined to just kick the habit for good. Almost everyone I know has quit smoking and I really want to join that happy shiny people club. 

Do you think it's a good idea for me to stop smoking now or should I just wait till I get better? Have any of you had experiences quitting when you're diagnosed with depression and anxiety? 

How do you get through the first week?

Help, please.

I'm on day seven. Using nicotine gum. I'm so drowsy and I have absolutely no motivation to do anything. There are things I NEED to do by tomorrow and I just feel blah. Numb and exhausted. Is this normal? Has anyone else experienced this and was there anything you found you could do to help make it easier?

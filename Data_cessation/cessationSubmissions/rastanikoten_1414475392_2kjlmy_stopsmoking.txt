Quitting again and I need strength to make it

Dear /r/stopsmoking,

I quit smoking (for about the seventh time) in April 1 2013 until some day September 2013. I quit on an impulse, cold turkey one morning and it was the most success I ever had in quitting. I started to work out my body and started losing weight but it all ended about six months in: There was bad weather. I was in my garage and heard the wind pick up. It sounded serious so I decided to evac the garage and a very large tree snapped and fell near me. I was spooked and nervous and I asked a friend for a cigarette to steady my nerves. Then I kept smoking. Here we are over a year later and I think it really was a depressing year. I started smoking again, I quit exercising, and I quit my second attempt at college education after a year and a half into it. The only good news is that I was able to land a badass programming job and I love it.

Well, now I am ready to bust out of my reclusive shell and quit. Again. Last night, I decided on a whim to quit smoking so today was a cold turkey day. It has  been about 24 hours and the cravings are pretty darn intense.


I think its therapeutic to get through the cravings by reflecting here. I list the reasons I do not want to smoke: 

* Primarily because it's bad for me and I had read that a person under 30 who quits smoking is returned most of what health they lost by smoking. I am thirty in two weeks. I want to live to an old age but I'm an obese smoker and so unless I change my ways, I'd guess mortality catches me before I ever get the chance to retire. 

* In 6 weeks, I am traveling to my company HQ and the company hates smoking I don't want to have a bunch of awful cravings.

* I want to get laid, so I need to get fit, so I need to quit smoking and exercise more

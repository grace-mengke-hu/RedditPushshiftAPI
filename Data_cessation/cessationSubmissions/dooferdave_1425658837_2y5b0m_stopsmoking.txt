Badge Distribution - 155 new quitters and what's up with week 4?

Has anybody looked at the badge distribution? 
I am encouraged that most weeks/month badges have lots of members (except for week 4...WTF!)  with the most being in the year bucket with nearly 12K members. Keep it up everybody! You aren't alone.

A dirt cheap nicotine replacement option

I smoked throughout my late teens and quit about a dozen times in that time period. I successfully quit by switching to vaping. Vaped for several more years. Although vaping was significantly cheaper than smoking I did not like how much I was spending. I have since found a cheap, "healthy" way to get my nicotine fix.

Buy highly concentrated, unflavored nicotine juice online. I'm talking 50-100mg/mL. Buy a graduated dropper/pipette/syringe that measures volumes less than a milliliter. Measure out the desired dose and put the liquid in your gums. WARNING: Large doses of nicotine can make you sick or even kill you so be careful and accurately measure your doses! 

The taste is very unpleasant but in my opinion this is an advantage because you won't develop a psychological addiction in addition to the physical addiction. I've found that swallowing the solution upsets my stomach so I just hold it in my mouth and spit it out after a while. This is about the safest method to ingest nicotine out there and costs only a few cents a day.

Good luck, guys!

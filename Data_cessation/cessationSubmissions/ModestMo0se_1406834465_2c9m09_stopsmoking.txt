I just smoked my last cigarette.

I have been a cigarette smoker for 14 years (I'm 30.)  I am tired of the sore lungs.  I am tired of the smell.  I am tired of the fatigue and inactivity.  I am tired of being out of breath after going up the stairs.  I am tired of the thought that i'm damaging my body beyond repair.

I quit another addictive substance last year for my 7 month old son (who was a newborn at the time).  The cravings were horrible, and the substance illegal.  But the joy I feel at having beaten that addiction has been tempered by my inability to quit smoking.  The guilt of a cigarette never washes away when I look at him, no matter how many times I wash my hands and change my shirt before I pick him up or hold him.

I don't want my son to be fatherless at age 20.  I don't want him to be exposed to second-hand smoke (though I know i've gone to great lengths to diminish it, you can never eliminate it completely).  I want him to know his father, and not bury him before it's my time.

I'm tired of it.  I felt the disgust when I took that last puff.  I let the taste of it sit in my mouth, and i'm as determined to beat this awful, shitty habit before it beats me into the ground.

I've been lurking for some time, thinking about the benefits.  But looking at my little dude is more than enough for me now.

Day 1, and i'm going to beat this.  I HAVE to.

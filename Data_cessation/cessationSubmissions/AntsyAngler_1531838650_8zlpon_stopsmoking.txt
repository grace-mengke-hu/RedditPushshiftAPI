50 Days! Wow. First festival as a non-smoker in 12 years.

I am so thrilled to have made it to 50 days.  I just returned home from a festival where I always smoke (except the 2 years I was pregnant).  On the way to the festival my husband said he was going to stop and buy cigarettes.  I said, "No, let's not.  I want to not smoke there this year."  

Sometimes it was very hard not to ask a friend for a smoke.  I just kept thinking "I'm a non-smoker.  Why would I do that?  That cigarette is not going to make anything better."  And thinking that helped a bit.

It's still a struggle but it's happening.  I can't wait to be at 500 days.  But I'll be happy with 50 for the moment.

i'm gonna try

i've been smoking about eighteen years. i'm tired of it. it's not cool, it's cost me shots with some girls, it's expensive. Hell, tons of cons. y'all know. i've tried to quit before but, ya know. i'm going cold turkey tomorrow.  actually I'm starting tonight. i'm smoking my last Marlboro after i post this. any tips, advice would be appreciated. wish me luck!

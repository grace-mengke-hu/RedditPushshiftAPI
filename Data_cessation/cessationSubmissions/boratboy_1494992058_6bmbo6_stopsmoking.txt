Wake up with weird stretching feeling?

You know when you smoke a ton of cigarettes one night and you wake up, take a deep breath and feel that stretching feeling. Like a crackle perhaps? Well I've been feeling that for about 4 months. I quit smoking but am still feeling it. Any ideas what this could be?

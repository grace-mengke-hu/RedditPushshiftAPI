Quitting while living with someone who smokes..

Is it possible? I've tried to quit cold turkey but it feels impossible when i have constant access to cigarettes. I've already discussed the possibility of said person also quitting, but they don't have the desire to at this time.

I feel really defeated. I've tried to quit and failed so many times. It just seems impossible at this point.

It's time to quit

I'll be 41 in April. I've been smoking regularly since high school, and it's time to quit. My goal is to be cigarette-free by the end of this month. I'm looking forward to feeling better and living better.

To everyone trying to quit, I want to say I wish you the best of luck. To everyone who has quit, congratulations. I hope to join your ranks soon.

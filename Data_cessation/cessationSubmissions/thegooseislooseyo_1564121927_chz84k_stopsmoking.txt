67 Days Cig Free

I am vaping 6mg a bit through the days but this is the longest I've gone cigarette free since starting up 7 years ago!  Some days I don't hit the vape but a few times. Also, my at home triggers and cravings have diminished to almost nothing. I do still get cravings when sitting around a fire, at festivals or late in the night when drinking. Still sticking to the mantra, 'not one more puff, no matter what!' It's working. Keep it up everyone!

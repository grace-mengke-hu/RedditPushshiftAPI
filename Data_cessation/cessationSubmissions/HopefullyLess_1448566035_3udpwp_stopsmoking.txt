Caved after 41 days because of unfortunate living situation

The apartment in my students home was closed down because a fire exit wasn't completed, and I had to do a little "surprise move" into an apartment in the same complex that was even more unfinished. 

The extra-ordinary circumstances seemed to activate circuitry that was hidden somewhere in my brain, and I smoked one with the construction workers who were finishing the floor in my room. Bought a pack of cigarillos, smoked one of those too.

Before I went to bed that day, I wandered around a bit and wanted to light another one, but the thought wasn't very appealing, so I threw it away after one drag and "forgot" the pack at a bus stop. If I can pull this off now for another month, I think I'm okay with occasionally smoking.

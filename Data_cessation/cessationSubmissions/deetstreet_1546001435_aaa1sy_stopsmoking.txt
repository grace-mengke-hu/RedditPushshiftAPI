8 Days Smoke Free so far, questions about the patch

Hello all. I'm just over 8 days since my last cigarette (which is crazy to me). Have been using a nicotine replacement patch (Step 1 - 21mg/day) for the last week. It says on the instructions that you are supposed to continue with the first step for many weeks. I still get cravings pretty bad, several times a day, but with my addiction I've come to realize that my smoking is more a habitual problem than a chemical one. Does anyone have any experience stepping down to Step 2 of the patch earlier than it says to? TBH sometimes I don't even think that the patch is doing anything.

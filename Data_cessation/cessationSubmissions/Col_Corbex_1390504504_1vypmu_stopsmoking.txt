Wow how time flies

Well its been 46 days since I quit cold turkey.  The first couple days blew sasquatch dick. The first 2 weeks were tricky trying to break the daily routines, i.e. morning smoke, coffee smokes, pre poop smokes, before bed smokes. 

Fast forward to this morning; "Oh man, its been a while since I smoked... Wonder how long it has really been?"  I checked the calendar and had to recount 4 times to be sure.  46 Days off!!! Feels good!

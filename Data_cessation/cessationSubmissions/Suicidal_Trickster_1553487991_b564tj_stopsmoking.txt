My greatest obstacle is apathy.

Quitting smoking is fundamentally an optimistic act. You’re assuming that the future will reward your decision to quit smoking with a higher quality of life. 

What if the quality of your life won’t improve upon cessation? What if your lot in life is terrible and you’re destined to suffer no matter what you do? And what if civilization collapses in five years from a plague or a nuclear war or a famine? If human civilization is on the verge of collapse, why should we sacrifice short-term fulfillment for a much more elusive prospect of long-term health? 

And, of course, any of us might die tomorrow while crossing the street or shaving. 

And there’s the reality of clinical depression, which results in an inability to experience deep pleasure or satisfaction. Cigarettes at least make the void slightly less agonizing.

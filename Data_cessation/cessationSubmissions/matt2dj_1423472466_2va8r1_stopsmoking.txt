Can't seem to say NO on Friday night drinks, HELP!

I've stopped smoking for a bit over three weeks now, but the last two times I went out for drinks I ended up having the odd one or two ciggerette with my friends. I always start off strong, then I get a bit tipsy and thats when I just cave in. Lucky for me I dont drink that often but it is still enough for me to have a bitter dissappintment over myself. So what method do you use to say no when your drunk and out with your friends?

First adult birthday w/o a cigarette

Right before Christmas, I will be a 5 months in. Yesterday was the first birthday of my adult life that I didn’t have cigarettes. I’m not going to lie, it was on my mind good chunks of the day. I wonder why is that? How can I go a while without even thinking about it really but then one day where it’s on my mind all day long. I can’t really say a craving. Just missing it except not. I’d never go get one cause I’d be so disgusted with myself but why the fantasizing now about it? I so long for the day where cigarettes disgust me, but for now, I sometimes “miss” it, for lack of a better word. I think it’s kind of the activities I did while smoking maybe I miss(?). I used to go sit outside and just be in the quiet. I don’t anymore. I’m always running with no smoke breaks to slow me down. I do love the productive me, but I need the lazier version sometimes lol. It’s true how some say at first it is like losing a friend. Sometimes I do feel lonely even though I know the damn cigarette was just as lonely. Idk.

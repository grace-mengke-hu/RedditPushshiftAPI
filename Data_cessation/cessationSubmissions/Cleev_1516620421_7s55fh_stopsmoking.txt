Fourteen Hours

I know it doesn't sound like a lot, but it's the longest I've gone without a cigarette in twenty years.

Edit:  Hour 18.  I can't promise what's going to happen after, but I will make it to 24.

Edit:  Coming up on 21.  This really sucks.

Final Edit:  Well, I made it to 24.  Got jammed up in traffic on the way home from work and shook an empty pack in desperation.  Turns out it wasn't empty.  Resetting my countdown, I guess.  36 minutes in.

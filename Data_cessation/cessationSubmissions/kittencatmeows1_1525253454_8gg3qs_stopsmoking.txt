Time to call in the calvary

I have been trying to quit for so long. Seriously,like a year. I am not making any progress, and I have panic attacks when I smoke. 
Tomorrow I see my doctor, getting nicotine gum. I also have located a vape to buy on friday (cool points took a hit). 
It doesn't devalue the quit if you use tools, I don't have to quit cold turkey inorder for it to count. 
I have to quit, for the sake of my sanity and health.

I'm finally free!

I have been dying (literally?) to quit smoking cigarettes for about a week now.  It had been a couple of months of continuous thoughts like "I will die if I keep doing this", and "This is doing nothing but hurting me". 

The problem for me was that I didn't want to give up my vice completely.  I enjoy the social aspect of smoking.  I decided on a vaporizer setup and it has really helped a *lot*.  

Okay, so it's only been about 12 hours now, but for me that is a huge deal.  I don't even care about the nicotine addiction at this point.  I'm just glad I don't have to continue damaging my body to satisfy it.

If you want to quit smoking but you aren't sure you'll be able to do it...  Try a vaporizer.  Seriously.  I haven't even wanted a cigarette.  I mean, aside from the habitual reaching for the pack or looking for my lighter without thinking, but that's just because I'm not accustomed to searching for my vaper yet.  I haven't had that *craving* for a cigarette.  

That really feels so foreign to me.   You become addicted to those things and you actually believe it's the cigarette you're craving, like you are really craving the smoke/harshness/taste/smell/whatever.  It amazes me that I can hit my vaporizer and immediately I have no desire for a cigarette.  

Obviously quitting completely and ridding yourself of the nicotine addiction is the best course of action, but if you are struggling or would just be satisfied with a *far safer* alternative, vaping may be for you.  

12 hours... Wow.  That is unheard of for someone like me who smoked at least 1 cigarette an hour, usually more, who'd start feeling the craving after only 30-45 minutes at the most.  That is a major victory.  

I feel liberated as fuck.

Day 384, first post

I owe you all a lot.  This was the first subreddit I ever visited after looking exclusively at /r/leagueoflegends for over a year.  I got my badge, read stories, reset my badge a couple of times and finally it took hold and here I am over a year later.  The first month it was critical that I read accounts and lurked here.  After getting that momentum, it got so much easier and I only stopped by now and then to see my badge number grow, see how everyone is doing and remind myself to stay strong in any moments of weakness.  Thing is, it really kicked off a reckoning in myself that I have an addictive personality.  So I used the same technique with /r/stopgaming and /r/stopdrinking, both of which I have over 6 month badges with now.  My health is most definitely better.  I still face plenty of challenges I need to work on in life, but alas, smoking is not one of them.  Thank you all so much, /r/stopsmoking

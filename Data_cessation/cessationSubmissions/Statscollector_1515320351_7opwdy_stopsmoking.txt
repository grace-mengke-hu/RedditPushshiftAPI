My House is cleaner than it's ever been

Yesterday was day 2 for me. Every time I started really wanting a cigarette I got off the couch and did some cleaning. 

My kitchen cupboards have all been emptied, washed and filled, all my floors have been hoovered, my oven and fridge are clean and my bathroom is looking better than it has in years....

I'm vaguely worried i've not left many chores to do today, but I woke up feeling great about myself and my house :)

58 hours and counting.

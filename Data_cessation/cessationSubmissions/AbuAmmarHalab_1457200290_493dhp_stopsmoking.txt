One month!

It has been an interesting month for me, with ups and downs, but the most important thing is that it has been smoke free.
I quit cold turkey with the help of Allan Carr's book.No e-cigs, no nicotine patches or gum or any kind of replacement.
I can't belive the turn my life took when I quit.After some miserable 3 first days, everything started to get better.I have started to go to gym(i got less and less tired), eat a little healthier (i always used to skip meals for a cig and coffee) and my oral hygiene improved so much(I used to say the usual if I brush my teeth now it won't matter cause I will smoke in 5 minutes).
I really can't think of any reason in the world that would make me get back to inhaling poison again!
Thanks for reading and I hope my story will inspire new quitters.

Need advice to quit while in a very heavy-smoking environment

I just need help. I already realized that smoke does nothing for me, it is actually tastes no good (The addiction that tricks my brain to taste it good), I can never save money every month from my monthly money (im still in the 3rd semester) because of a pack for 2 days, and I am a bookgeek, and realized that I could spent much on more books if I am not a smoker.

But my environment haunts me, like, almost all of my friends and inner circles are smoker, (Im living in the country where the smoking rate is still very high, like, non-smoking trait is still an inevitable on our youth environment who loves to hang out, drinking coffee every night, etc etc), and i am sadly allowed to smoke by my parents; i don't know if i can still hang out and go to bars on weekend with many friends without smoking. 

I have read allen carr's book, and it my quit lasted only for 1 week.

Help! thank you

About time I quit now

Started smoking when I was about 13 years old. I never smoked that much, almost half a pack a day. 

The downsides have been pretty apparent, though. 
I've had stomach problems for a few months now and they certainly did not get better by smoking. 
It also made my rheumatic disease a lot more active, which I really can't afford at my young age. Paying for being in more pain just seems pretty damn stupid. 
And lets not forget the money aspect, I've been working my ass off to finance my studies and had little money to spend on myself as a result of smoking. 

And lets not forget that Movember is coming up and it seems pretty hypocritical to raise awareness of health problems while I'm still actively damaging my body. It's not even that popular in my country, so quitting seems like a good start to get some more attention to it. 

I just smoked my last cigarrette and my body is already rebelling. I guess it's about time I show it who's really in charge of it.

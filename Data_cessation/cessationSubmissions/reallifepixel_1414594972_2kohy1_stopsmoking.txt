[Day 3] Less internal pressure to smoke, still habitual forces exist

So, I've made it through the first two days which are usually the most brutal. I hate them. Feels like my soul is a piece of paper and it is slowly being torn. But gotten through it! Glad to put those days behind me because they become new incentive to stay quit. "I don't want to go through that again".


But, I still find there a times where instinctively I want a smoke. Break times. Just have to create new habits. I've been going to bed super early and waking up stupid early. I made it to the gym this morning.


I notice improvements with my body. Not as phlegmatic.


Enough talk about it... makes me want one. Ha

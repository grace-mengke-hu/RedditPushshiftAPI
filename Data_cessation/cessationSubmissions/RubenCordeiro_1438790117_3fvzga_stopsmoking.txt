Only two days ago I realised I was an addict

I've smoked for 2 months, but despite the short period of smoking I really felt horrible.

Shortness of breath, lack of energy, irregular sleep... the list goes on and on.

I stopped smoking in June of this year and stayed smoke free for a month and a half.

However, I failed a driving exam. The disappointment and frustration led me to drink a couple of beers (actually, slightly more than a couple). I fell into the trap again: bought a pack of cigarretes and started smoking briefly.

I never really thought I was addicted to cigarretes, but now I came to that conclusion. 

Yesterday I smoked my last cigarette and I'll look of someone or this community if the urge arises. Alcohol will also stay off my radar for the foreseeable future.

Cheers,
Ruben Cordeiro

Feeling super antsy

It's been 5 days for me now and overall I'm glad I'm finally doing it. Outside from a general foggy feeling in my head, the only other thing I'm going through is an antsyness and inability to want to sit still. I do exercise, but it's still persistent even afterwards. When I used to feel like I "needed to do something," a lot of times I would go out for a smoke and feel accomplished in a strange way. Does anyone else relate, have any ideas for a solution?

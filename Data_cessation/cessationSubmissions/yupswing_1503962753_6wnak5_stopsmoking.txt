Some thoughts about my first week.

Aye aye fellow quitters,
[I have just passed 1 week](http://imgur.com/eeruN8Z)

I am 32yo and I have been smoking for 14 years straight. I had quit twice: once for 3 months, long time ago (with help from Carr's book), and once (smoking less as possible to please my then gf) for few months 3 years ago.

*It never lasted.*

Last week I decided I had enough, I don't want to be a slave of any substance anymore and nicotine is the only drug I was constantly using. (I don't even drink coffee).

I have a bad cancer history in my family, and I've waited long enough to quit already. I used to smoke around 25 slim rolled cigarettes per day, a lot more on weekends.

So basically the idea was in the back of my mind for long time now, but no real intention to actually quit until last week.
Last Monday,  I did not think too much about it and I just smoked what I called my last cigarette.
When I had finished that, I calmly gathered every leftover packet of tobacco, papers and filters, every butt and ashtray laying around and I threw everything in the bin.

First day was hard. Waking up and craving a cigarettes, seconds after opening my eyes.
But I just had to take it easy. Going to work (40 minutes by walk every day like usual) I threw away my trash (no butts in my house, I remember those Sundays when every tobacco shop is closed and I had no more tobacco and I was looking in the ashtrays and my trash for butts to open and gather some dry tobacco for a cigarette... not my best moments).

I used to smoke when I walk (and I walk a lot), when I finish eating, when I stay at home in front of my pc and especially when I go out with people. So basically every free moment in my life.

#First day
It went ok. I started experiencing twitching eyes (it looks like when I crave nicotine they start hurting a bit and twitching a lot) many times during the day.
In the evening I went running and it was a really good idea: I guess endorphines helped a lot to make me feel happy and also I got a huge sense of accomplishment (I had not been running in the past 5 months).
Went to bed early, trying to avoid thinking about cigs, a bit tired but happy I had made it thru.

# Second day
Pretty much the same, just happy to see it lasted more than 24 hours (the app really helps to see progress, I went looking at the time smoke free like 20 times a day). Started experiencing some nausea during the day, cravings quite intense that lasted around 10 minutes, also at random moments, but especially at my "cigarette moments" (after food, while walking...).
I started to experience a really strong sense of smell. It improved a lot this week, but the second day it really struck me: I was sensing fabulous smells outside bakeries... It's amazing, just after one day.
So, another day crushed, talk to my best friend about my 48 hours free to get some support and it helped.

I don't like to ask for cheering, and especially I don't like the idea of sharing my effort with fear of failing, but I think it's wrong. Share it with everybody, it shows yourself you are committed. We can fail, but at least it shows we really tried.

# Third day
This went a lot better. I've read for many people days 3 to 5 are really hard, but it wasn't for me. I had no more nausea or other side effects. Still twitching eyes when a craving arrives.
I felt so much better, everything looked easier. I went running again and my breath was so much better I felt really galvanised.
My body already started to show improvements, and this is so important to feel better.
We obviously need time to get long-lasting results, but quit smoking has this lucky effect of showing visible changes real fast and it helps the mood and commitment a lot if we use it to do something.
Also my resting heart beat is slower and more stable.

# Fourth day

Less cravings, less twitching. Easy peasy.

# Fifth day

Still easy, but for the first time I've decided to go out, with a close smoking friend (I forced myself to avoid social situations in these days to help me avoid temptations).
I, strangely, did not felt the need to smoke at all.
I got drunk, the same kind of situation when I was usually chain smoking all night, but I did not smoke at all.
This was a major success to me, the real feeling that "I can do it", as I am doing it.

# Sixth day

Sunday was easy, I walked and went running and took care of home duties. No need to smoke, not a single craving. The end of a strange new week, same stuff but minus tobacco. And it was possible.

# Seventh day (today)
Another Monday, no cravings up to this evening. Tonight after dinner I really really wanted a cigarette, three different times.
Cravings lasted few minutes (still eyes twitch), but I just embraced them and they passed. I am free from tobacco.

Now I know there is still a long way to go, but I hope it's just a matter of keep doing what I'm doing.

[Except a bit fatter (shite!) everything else is perfect](http://i.imgur.com/2qhUyTL.png), and I knew that, so it's no big surprise; I can and will tackle that in the close future.

I feel happy about myself, I thought it would have been a lot harder, but for now it isn't. I believe everybody can do it, so if you are struggling to quit or you are in your first weeks I hope this post was an interesting point of view.

Thanks for reading me.

Have a great day :)

For my 20th anniversary with cigarettes, I'm breaking up with them.

My mom smoked in our house growing up. Marlboro Light 100s in a box, we used to tear off and save the Marlboro Miles and get hats or jackets or whatever. Everyone used to smoke everywhere: on planes, in restaurants, bars. Never really seemed like a big deal.

I quit for four days a few years ago and remember smelling and tasting like I hadn't really ever before. 

I've smoked American Spirits for the past ten years, sometimes rolling my own, usually prefabs. It's old hat, though. I'm a musician and singer and have noticed my circulation and lung capacity really weaken over the past few years.

I've been lurking here for a month or so and am ready to dive in. I have lobelia capsules and dried mullein on hand, to ease cravings/nausea and help with healing my lungs, as well as a box of cinnamon toothpicks and a pack of cinnamon gum. I've read Allen Carr's book and downloaded Smoke Free. 

Wish me luck!

3 months & 28 days

All I can say is that it gets easier. I still get cravings a couple times a week. That's it. It's all about making it past the cravings. When you get this far along the cravings appear smaller and easier to beat, even though it might just be the confidence you've worked up. I still have dreams about cigarettes which is weird. It would not have been possible up until now without my partner. It gets easier friends. Just take it one day at a time. -Z

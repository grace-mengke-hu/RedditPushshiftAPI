Two months!

It's been exactly sixty days since my last smoke. I'm feeling great and wanted to let everyone know that it get's better. I've started running as well - you can feel your lung capacity growing as time passes, which is really neat. The day I switched from 2 km to 5 km runs was one of my proudest moments in a long time.

Any advice out there for the next stages in the quitting process?

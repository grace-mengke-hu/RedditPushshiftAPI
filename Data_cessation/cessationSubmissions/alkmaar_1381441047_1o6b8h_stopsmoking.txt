Motherfuckin' week!

That's right ladies and bros. I survived a week without a cigarette and I feel great. I probably had the worst withdrawal today at dinner where i was sure i was going to go get a smoke right after dinner. But hey, i listened to you guys, and that voice died down eventually. Here's a list you all might enjoy.

 **Changes i've noticed so far:**

* Can smell much better than i have for the past 5 years. Been experiencing a sensory overload by going for long walks cause everything smells so god damn amazing!

* Digestion has definitely improved by a mile. Im the type of smoker who'd have a smoke after every god damn meal/snack. First 4 days were absolute hell but everythings gone back to normal and strangely i get full by smaller portions of food as compared to when i smoked. Not sure if that'll change later on but so far it's great in keeping in shape.

* Gym! Holy fucking hell guys i know it's only been a week but i could FEEL the energy in the gym. I was banging set after set like it was no big deal whereas before i'd be dead by the 3rd workout. Might be away form the gym next week so i'm going to start running daily. 

* O2 overdose. Shit my nasal passages are slooowly clearing up and i'd be in office working and all of a sudden i'd get all dizzy and light headed. This might end up in a headache but it's no big deal. It's just a lot more oxygen going into my system than i'm used to.

* Much Much better sleep. I wake up fresh and relaxed and on time!

**How i'd try combat the withdrawals:**

* Now most of my friends smoke and i believe the best way to get rid of the habit is to soldier your way through all the shit. I'd hang out with them as normal, they'd smoke while i'd sip my tea. ONE thing that i started doing was i'd take a ciggi from them and i'd start smelling it. haha i know it sounds retarded but damn does it feel good. Doesn't really aggrevate the brain. I just like the smell of an unburnt ciggi

* Water. Water water water water water water water. I've said enough.

* Boy i would LOVE to stuff my mouth with shitloads of candies and cashews and chocolates every time i get a craving. But i'm also working out and doing that would put all the hard work to waste. Important thing is to keep your hands and brain busy when you get that annoying signal. If i'm home, i'd grab my guitar and just start playing random shit. Doesn't matter if it's good or not, diverts my attention form the ciggi. If i'm in the office, i'll put up a short flash game online and play for 4-5 mins. Does the trick everytime. Oh and eat your vegetables people. They taste amazing.

* Exercise. Working out is the best reminder of why quitting was a good decision. I'd often question my decision when i'm bored and a trip to the gym sets me straight. Seriously guys if not a gym, go to a park and start running. Just fucking do SOMETHING!

Hope to keep you updated throughout my journey. Let's hope i don't fuck this up. Stay strong everyone!

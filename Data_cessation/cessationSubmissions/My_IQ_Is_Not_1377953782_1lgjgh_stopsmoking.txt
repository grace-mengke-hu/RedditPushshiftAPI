Day One

So I was on my way to the store last night and I just decided enough. It's been 18 years or so of smoking and I just can't do it anymore. So I bought some McDonald's with the money (not great for health lol, but better than a pack I would think given no weight issues for me) and turned back. No it's morning and I'm officially on day one.

I'm not a big "rah rah" guy nor am I the type that needs a lot of recognition or pats on the back for my self esteem. But I've tried many, many times before and I know that support is *always* better.

I've been told that I have "dogged determination" and I have succeeded in a lot of areas that the world told me I couldn't. I've never been able to apply that to smoking before.

I feel different this time though. I remember the wave that came over me when I had this thought "Other people do it, so I can definitely accomplish this". In order to be "strong" you have to defeat your weakness. This has definitely been my weakness. Buck up time.

Thanks for reading!

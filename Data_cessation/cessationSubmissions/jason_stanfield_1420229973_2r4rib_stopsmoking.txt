Day 2: My Chest Hurts

After failing in my resolve this past weekend, I'm giving it another shot. I made it 18.5 hours then, and now I'm at 37.5 hours.

I feel like I've been kicked in the lungs. My whole chest is *so sore*. I've read this is normal, but there's no advice on managing that symptom or when to expect it will go away.

I took a couple of Aleve about an hour and a half ago, but it's barely making a dent.

Any tips on how to get through this chest pain?

Chronic cough, a little worried

I  am 22, I have smoked on and off for 3.75 years  This is an overestimate because I only smoked during social occasions and mainly marijuana. I have never smoked two days in a row. Never smoked a cigarette. I did smoke hookah for a few months though (again only socially). Last time I smoked was probably a few months ago. I have stopped everything smoking completely. I am wondering what my risk for developing COPD is based on my smoking history, I have a chronic cough for about 7 months now (got it after but the cough never went away) so I am a little worried. I also have a childhood history of asthma. Is the amount I have smoked already enough to cause this kind of damage.

Thank you for helping

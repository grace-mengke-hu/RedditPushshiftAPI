Day 11 Chantix/Day 1 no smokes

I was on Chantix for 11 days which cut my cravings. Found out that it aggravated my ulcer so I can't take it and just have to go cold turkey. I think the worst is this morning,not having that first daily cigarette. Trying to power through this and get to work. I think I'll be distracted once I get there. Hopefully. Wish me luck!

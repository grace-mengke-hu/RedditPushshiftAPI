Heart patient who has been smoking for 3 years now...

Hi there. I'm 21 years old (or at least my birthday is monday, the 24th of sept) and was born with a heart condition. Long story short I had to get my pulmonary valve replaced in late august of 2017 (open heart surgery- sucked ass...) and stopped smoking after that for about 6-7 months. Picked it up back again and I'm really hating myself for it. I smoke anywhere from 2 cigarettes to 6 a day and can feel how badly it is affecting my health, but just can't seem to quit. I tend to associate cigarettes with "aesthetics" and can't help but feel great and attractive with a cigarette in my hand. I wish there was a way I could keep smoking one here and there without it becoming a problem, but as you can see I planned on just smoking one on new year's and it all eventually spiraled into this. I've bought a $60 vape with nicotine and non-nicotine juices - it seems to help but the craving is always there regardless. The first time I quit was right before my surgery due to my declining health, and a little gas station e-cigarette is what helped me to quit the first time but I'm hoping this works a second time as well. Please wish me luck, and I'll let you guys know when I'm a week straight without smoking.

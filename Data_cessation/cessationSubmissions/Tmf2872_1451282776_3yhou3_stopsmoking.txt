I'm 150 hours without a cigarette! But I'm wondering, people who have quit cigarettes do y'all still vape?

So I'm at 150 hours without a cigarette! I also used to vape quite a bit. I'm wondering should I quit that too or just get the e-juice with no nicotine to use only when I feel like I'm really going to cave and buy a pack of cigarettes? I'm afraid I'll lose my willpower and end up buying a pack of cigarettes if I use the vape again. But I also spent a good bit of money on my vape so I'd hate to just throw it out. I just would like to hear different opinions on this! Thanks!

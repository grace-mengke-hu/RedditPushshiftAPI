Insomnia...

I have been using chantix to quit, and it has worked beautifully! Not as much as a single side effect... 

But since my quit, I have had an increasingly harder time sleeping. Once I fall asleep, i am out... But actually getting there is SO hard, and with three kids and two dogs, job and husband... That cocktail is frankly starting to freak me out! 

Was it like this for the rest of you too?

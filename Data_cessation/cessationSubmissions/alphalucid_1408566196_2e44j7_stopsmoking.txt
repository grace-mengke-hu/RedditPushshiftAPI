woop! 4 weeks.

I have lingering desires to smoke, but they're not so intense. After the first week (which was by far the hardest), the difficulty I've had so far were particularly stressful days and at bars that have indoor smoking.

For the stressful days, I figure that it's not much better in the moment to have a smoke. And the physical stress of smoking over a period tends to cause more anxiety. I kinda just wish there was something else to alter my state of mind. If no other reason than to just distract me from that stressful moment. lol.

Drinking a lot less has been harder in some ways. Hard to get to sleep and emotions run a little too strong at night.

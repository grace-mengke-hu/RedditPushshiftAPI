day 10, but slipped smoked a cigarette, so starting again right now

Hello...I slipped and smoked a cig after 10 days of beautiful abstinance...feel pretty bad. My lungs are bad, the cig sucked, i did not enjoy it! So I am starting all over again right now so that it is just a slip, and not a full relapse...however will reset my badge. This time I am quitting coffee too, as it is a trigger for me. I feel pretty bad :(:(:( 

So agan!!
embarking on day 1 with no cigs or coffee. after a bad slip, that did not taste good, I must remember how bad it felt to lose my streak! 
Never again.

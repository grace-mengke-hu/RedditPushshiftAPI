Sudden realisation

On Queens Day (April 30, ) 2004 I had my first puff ever. The guy who offered it to me works at BAT today,  poor soul. 
Queens Day 07 I was addicted. 

Today, Kings Day 2015, will be my first national holiday in 11 years without a smoke,  and I'm looking forward to it! 

I'll have a beer for you lot! Reading through your posts and comments made this so much easier.

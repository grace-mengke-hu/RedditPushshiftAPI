Has Any one used the 21700 Batteries yet for box mods.

I am just curious if I should come out with a mod for my business that supports this battery. I have a 20700 mod now and i am very impressed with these batteries. I was just curious if these are any better or not. Also do they seem to last longer and what is your preferred brand to buy. I just want to come out with the best products for my customers and i think this is the best way to find out by asking people who have actually used them!

A deep question!

Hi all, I am 31 (Phd mechanical engineer) and I started smoking from 18. I never tried to give it up. 5 days ago I decided to give it up (just because of health issues). I don't have a serious craving (at least yet) but still I think smoking was my "best friend". It helped me to pass all the difficult days of life, and lonliness moments. It helped me to fress up my mind during study. To be honest, I think it helped me to "think" better and to improve the quality of my life. I am quiet sure that if smoking wasn't severely harmful for health, I have never decided to leave it! Sometimes I think does health worthy enough to stop smoking? This question may seem stupid, but in a higher level it may have a world of philosophy behind it (you may want to change the word "smoking" in it with any other object).

Is there anyone else have the same (maybe senseless) idea and thoughts?!

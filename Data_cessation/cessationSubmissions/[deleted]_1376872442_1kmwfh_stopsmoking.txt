Quit, relapsed. Tomorrow I start my fight again.

So I picked up smoking in 12th grade. I quite after first year uni. Stayed clean for a year, but I had hookah and cigars every now and then, which I think helped me relapse and I've smoked for the past two weeks. I'm beginning this struggle once again, and I hope this time I can leave for good.

HERE'S TO BEATING IT FOR GOOD!!! MADAME TOBACCO, YOU HAVE NO POWER OVER ME!!!!

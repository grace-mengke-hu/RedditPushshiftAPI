Done

Have been lurking here for a while. Have been contemplating quitting for a few months already, after a run of almost one year (never truly quit as I was dibbling and dabbling with smoking socially every so often), clearly having fooled myself into thinking that because quitting was so easy for me, it would be easy again. Fooling myself into thinking that one is ok because I'm not a regular smoker. 

Basically denying the fact that any smokes at all puts you under the smokers bracket almost instantaneously. So yeah, a couple of smokes with drinks did in fact turn into a couple of months of full on 24 hour smoking, and since that day I've been convincing myself that each cigarette is the last one. 

The thing that broke this pattern was realising what was happening. My brain was making excuses for 'another' from this past years experiences. Simple, but seeing this is what illuminated my thinking. Also meaning that the simple solution was to just break the cycle, to not smoke that next cigarette! And keep ingraining this new line of thinking.

So here goes, I'm determined and feeling strong about this one. Stay strong with me :)

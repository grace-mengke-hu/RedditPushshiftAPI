Recently given up. Weird strategy working for me.

So I'll cut to the point. I have a pack of straights that I carry around with me, Pall Mall lights. When I crave a cig, I put one between my teeth and draw from it deeply. I don't light the cig. I just satisfy the craving by emulating the action of taking a drag. Then I take the cig and, depending on how 'FUCK-SMOKING' I'm feeling, I either snap it and bin it or put it back in my pack.

Every other time I've quit, the first few days have been hell. I can't sleep at night, I just lie there in want of a smoke. I get anxious. All sorts...

This time, with this technique, I barely even feel cravings. I just get the sense that I'm not doing something with my hands. I use my technique and then I get on with my day.

I don't know how much I can recommend this - it could be risky for some people - but it sure as hell works for me.

Who's getting fat?

Everyone said a little weight gain is normal.  I was worried cause I've been trying (and mostly succeeding) to lose 1-2lbs a week since new years.  The first week I admit I basically sat down and ate my feelings 24/7.

Gained about 3lbs.

The next week I was like "whoa now. .. maybe carrots instead of chips?"  Stayed on target at 1800 cal a day (enough for my giant ass to lose 1 lb). And I still gained 1lb.

So I'm hoping it'll taper off.   4ish lbs.  I guess it's not a life ruining amount or anything,  and it's certainly worth the freedom from cigs,  but I was just curious if any of y'all have had to battle your stomachs during this.

Eat apples when you have a craving

This has helped me tremendously in the past. Not only are apples good for you and delicious, they help curb some of physically habitual addictions to smoking. The hand to mouth oral fixation is satisfied, and unlike e cigs, you can tell when you're done which was always a problem when I tried e cigs. Just some friendly advice, hope it helps :)

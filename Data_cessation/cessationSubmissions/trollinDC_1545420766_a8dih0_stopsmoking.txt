Thinking back to what it felt like

I have a cold right now, which is almost gone after 2 days.  When I smoked it took a week or longer to get over a cold.  I remember how much worse it felt to have a cold and a smokers cough that exacerbated the sore throat.  Coughing up giant chunks of brown shit.  Trying not to cough because if I coughed once it would make me hack my lungs out.  

And the worst part:  Trying to smoke just a couple puffs from a cigarette while sick just to stop the cravings, which ultimately just made me feel worse.  Everything about quitting smoking is 100% worth it.

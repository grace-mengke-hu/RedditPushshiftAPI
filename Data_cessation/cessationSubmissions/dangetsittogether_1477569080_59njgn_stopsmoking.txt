Almost done with my first full work week

Okay, last week I had an abbreviated work week followed by a little vacation with my wife while my parents watched our kids and it was really great. I didn't have much of a hard time not smoking.

This week though has been more of a challenge. It's my first full work week without smoking and I'm getting to the two week mark, where typically I start to feel kind of depressed about not smoking, like I'm giving something up.

That feeling is exacerbated right now because of a little fight with my wife this morning. You know, lots of posters here talk about how fights with a spouse can trigger a craving.

I know that smoking won't resolve any issues and the only real way forward is to resolve the issues and manage the stress in a healthier way. I need to keep finding a way forward because going back to smoking isn't an option. I have kids to take care of and I can't do that to the best of my capability while smoking.

Quitting today !!

<p>Today is definitely my last day smoking. My motivation is to keep my ass alive so I can watch my family grow and after seeing a few posts here and advice I feel really good about this. </P>
<p>I'm going to avoid e-cig all together because I don't want a substitute I want to end the cravings and "needs" of cigs.</p> 
<p>I'm going with 6 things </p>
<p>1 - Pack of gum</P>
<p>2 - Toothpicks</P>
<p>3 - Gallon jug of water per day</p> 
<p>4 - Exercise </p>
<p>5 - Avoiding triggers </p>
<p>6 - /r/stopsmoking</p> 
<p>I'll try to document cravings, triggers and 2nd hand smoke. </p>
<p>I eat healthy and workout but because of my smoking I've completely given up on cardio; so I have a few things to work on and keep myself busy during the first week.</p>
<p>Wish me luck !</p>

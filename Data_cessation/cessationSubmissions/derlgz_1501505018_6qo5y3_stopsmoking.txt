I wanna quit but ...

I have been smoking a few years now, longest time i managed to quit was about 2,5 months it feelt great and i wanna get back to that state.
As saying so im starting my nosmoke try on 2017-07-31.
I tryed to quit noumerous times already ... and as far as i experienced, its getting way easier after the 2nd week, but till then its a tough fight.

Anyone got an advice on how to pass that time ?

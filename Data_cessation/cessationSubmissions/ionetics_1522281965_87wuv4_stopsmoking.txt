February- the cheatin' month

Only 28 days in Feb, so I get extra days' credit to comprise 1m, 2 days smoke free today. Getting easier over time, though some easier than others. Lately, I like to work with 'flooding'. That means I invite/encourage house guests and service providers to smoke in my presence. Helps me get used to being a non-smoker in all situations. 


I would hate to hate the smokers for smoking. Actually, I tend to like their FU attitude, but now choose not to smoke with them.

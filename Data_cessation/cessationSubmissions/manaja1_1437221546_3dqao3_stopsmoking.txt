Ex Smoker

Hi I stopped smoking 11 years ago, was smoking for over 20 years , at least a pack maybe 2 a day. I stopped because I developed a very dry hard cough, which lasted six weeks , every time I took a drag I coughed, I couldnt stop coughing. 
            This cough came back about four weeks ago , dry cough, when I talk , I sometimes break into a coughing spasm, just sat down tying now Im coughing. The only time Im not coughing is If I go for a jog , around 2 miles every other day. 
           I had a chest x ray last week and she said it was clear , Im still very worried , I hate smoking as it caused me to have emphysema at 39 , "mild over inflation of the lungs " is what the doctor said , hence the cough, which caused me to stop smoking.
             I also am coughing when im near spices like curry powder or chillis or anything like that, . Something is irritating me, just very worried being an ex smoker . Best of luck to anyone who is stopping or wants to stop this deadly habit.

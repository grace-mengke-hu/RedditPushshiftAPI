Beginning 8th day

Just stopping in to say I never thought I'd be without the insane thoughts leading me to the gas station but after tonight I kind of don't want to smoke or dip.   I know I'm not done having cravings but it's a lot more fun ignoring them now.  All my fellow quitters stay strong.  The nicotine monster can be defeated.

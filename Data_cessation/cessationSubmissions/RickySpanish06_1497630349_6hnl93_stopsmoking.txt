Advice?

So I've been smoking for 3 years and I've always used smoking as a way to get away and relax because I struggle with anxiety daily. It gives me a reason to get away from people for awhile and just chill out. Idk if smoking increases anxiety or not but smoking has definitely been a crutch for me like my phone. I know that I don't want to continue smoking though. I've tried vaping and I enjoy it (I have multiple mech mods) Anyway how successful is chewing gum to quit smoking? I've never tried nicotine gum or patches or anything. Any advice is welcome and appreciated.

3 Months...I am done

Well, It's been 92 days, or over 3 months. I have to say, I have been in every single situation that had potential to make me smoke, but I didn't. In-fact, I didn't even want to smoke in those situations. I was with my best friend all weekend visiting him, he still smokes...we would drink like idiots and smoke smoke smoke..Not this time. I didn't even want one when he was smoking. It didn't even phase me to want one. I just didn't want it. Actually it stunk like shit. I hope he quits soon. 

Hang in there kids.

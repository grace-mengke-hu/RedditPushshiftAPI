dealing with coughing everything out

I need some remedies, this time around I have been coughing REALLY bad. I mean it could just be a cold, but i know that this happened other times i tried to quit. i know this is bad, but ive been weening myself off of them, and after the 1 or 2 i feel fine for a while. I have 5 more left in the pack and im smoking 0 after that. im sure ill still be coughing up everything from my lungs to my toe nails at that point, anyone have any remedies?

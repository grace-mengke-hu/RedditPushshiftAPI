How to quit chewing?

Now yes I know, i know. Subreddit is "stopsmoking"

I am a 17 year old who used to smoke, started at 14, eventually started chewing. Been chewing for two years now.

I want to quit chewing, it tears my mouth up, i get gator lip, chewing too much ect. It's been worrying me for now a month and i think it's time to quit tobacco in general.

How do i do it? What will help? Thanks.

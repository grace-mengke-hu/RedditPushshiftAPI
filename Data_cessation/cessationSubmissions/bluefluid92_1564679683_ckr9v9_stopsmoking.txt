Attempt #1000



Today marks 6 days into my quit. As I have quit so many times before, I have no expectation whether this is going to be a success or not. All my previously relapses, reinforced my fear that “once addict, always an addict”. 

My longest quit was for 5 months commencing last November. I quit after my 2nd backup session at Alan Carr’s clinic. I thought to myself “if not now, then never” and extinguished my last cigarette. 

I have since then enjoyed all the benefits of the quit - my legs (veins) stopped hurting, i could climb a mountain, I could smell. Why would I ever want to start again? 

Five months later, I was a couple months into my job. On one particular day, I was extremely stressed with my job and the deadlines. The monster inside of me rationalised “ok if you are thaaaaaaat stressed, it’s okey to have a cigarette. But only one and only because you are so stressed” . This seemed logical to me so I caved in - I smoked one. One week later smoked another one, and the another one and before I knew it - I am smoking more than I ever did I before.  

I hated every day that I continued to smoke. It was so pointless. I could not concentrate anymore at work. All I could think of - when I will have my next one. I was in the cage. 

I had to act fast - last Saturday I went back to Alan Carr’s clinic and have not been smoking since. 

I sincerely hope that this one will stick.

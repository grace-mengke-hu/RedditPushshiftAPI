Hey hey heyyyy!! 1 month!

I somehow managed 1 month.  When I first started my cold turkey quit, I didn't think I would make it a day.  But I took it day by day and made it this far.

I still get cravings here and there while doing certain things, but it's no longer something I have to fight my will for.  I just put it out of my mind and I'm good now.

All you guys out there that haven't made it this far or are still wary of starting... Don't Worry! Looking back, that one month wasn't really too horrible.  It just seems like it will be. And it's that dread that makes it horrible.  You can do it! If I can do it, anyone can do it! <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3

smoking weed while quitting cigs

if i smoke bud while i quit cigs will my lungs still heal,  ive been cig free for 5 days but im still smoking a bowl twice a day, everytime i blaze up i literally cough up so much phlegm and i feel like im not even doing anything for my lungs if i smoke weed still.

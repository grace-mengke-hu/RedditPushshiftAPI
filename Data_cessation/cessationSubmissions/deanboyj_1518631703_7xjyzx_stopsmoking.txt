day 3. I think it's going to stick this time.

I hope it does anyway.  currently 31.  pack a day since I was 15.  tired of feeling like shit.  this isn't my first time trying to quit. but I hope it's my last.  this is the first time I've gone 3 days without cheating.  I'm using the nicoderm patch and it seems to be working.  it's like smoking the world's longest thinnest Virginia slim all day.  the coughing is starting which tells me my lungs are starting to heal.  I need some strength and encouragement for the days to come.  the hardest part is the amount of driving I do for work.  not smoking while driving is the biggest challenge and I don't know what to do with myself as I drive 2 plus hours a day for my job.  any fun tips to keep myself distracted?  

anyway good luck to anyone else trying this right now.  hopefully my smoking days are behind me.  already starting to feel better.  I do miss it though.  last night I had a dream that I found a pack of smokes and smoked the whole thing.  when I woke up I was both disappointed in myself (even though it was a dream) and also sad I didn't actually get to have one.  anyone else get dreams like that?

I think the fact that if I smoke with the patch on I could jeapordize my life is the main thing keeping me from cheating.  how long does it take for these feelings to subside?

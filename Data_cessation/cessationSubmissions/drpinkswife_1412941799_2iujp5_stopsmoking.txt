Everyone kept saying 'don't worry when you have to retake the test', which only made me more anxious. I was sure I would fail. I was sure I was going to have a panic attack.

I forgot to think of smoking at all! And as a reward, the only thing I thought was 'smoothie'. And the smoothie was lovely!

Edit: P.S. My examiner smelled of cigarettes and all I thought was 'So glad I don't smell like that anymore'.

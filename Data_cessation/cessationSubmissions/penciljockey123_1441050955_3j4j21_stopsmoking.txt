My dog doesn't know when its time to go outside....

I didn't smoke inside my house and was many times a day heading outside for a smoke.  My dog became conditioned to the sound of the ciggy pack being moved on the counter as her cue that we were headed outside.  She'd just hop up and go to the door with me.  Now I'll actually have to verbally ask if she wants to go out because that sound is now gone from our lives.  :)

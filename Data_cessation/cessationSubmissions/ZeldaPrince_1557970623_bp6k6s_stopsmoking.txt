What changes does your body go through when you stop smoking?

I’m on day two and I feel tired, some chest cramps, etc etc. I’m just wondering if once you stop smoking does your body go into “cleanup” mode? Like is your body working harder to expel the toxins?

And on that note, are there any supplements we should be taking to help make this process easier on our bodies?

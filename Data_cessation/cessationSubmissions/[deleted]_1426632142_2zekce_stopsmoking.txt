Small time smoker, trying to kick it. Any and all advice welcome.

I've had some health issues over the past year or so - I nearly died last year (lung problems - not smoking caused) and stupid rebellious teenage me decided that the best way to deal with this was using cigarettes as a coping mechanism. University stress led to an increase in how many I was smoking until I was on about 10 a day, not much really, but enough to get (and keep) me hooked. I've recently been told by doctors that my lungs are in -bad- shape and I -need- to stop smoking or I could get very, -very- ill again. 
You'd think that would make it easier... It hasn't made it easier. 
Just looking for some tips and a bit of support from people who have been there, done that, really... 
I feel I should also put in here that I have very little self discipline - not ideal in this situation, but it is what it is...

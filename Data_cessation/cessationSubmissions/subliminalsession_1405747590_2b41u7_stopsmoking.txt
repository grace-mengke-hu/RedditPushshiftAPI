nearly six weeks... now what?

i'm scared because although i feel great 80% of the time now, i have this nagging sensation every now and again that i'm gonna fail at some point. 

i've had loads of people tell me they quit for a prolonged period of time and then started smoking again and i'm terrified that this is going to happen to me. 

i don't really crave cigs anymore, i'm 90% grossed out by them when i smell them on other people, but i do still get 'cravings' whereby i am depressed/stressed feeling 'empty' or lacking of something. 

i've read all the allen carr shit and know all the reasons why not to smoke, believe me i don't want to smoke, i just don't want to even think about it? has anybody got any success stories on when they stopped thinking about it or how?

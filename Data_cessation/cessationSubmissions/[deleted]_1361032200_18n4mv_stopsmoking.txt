Even only after smoking 1 - 5 cigarettes daily, it feels like a hassle to quit. 

Okay, the habit started at the job I got awhile ago, and I started smoking in December. Because I turned 18 in november, I finally had access to it also.  Funny thing is, I was raised to hate smokers, hate cigarettes, and I did for the majority of my life but as soon as I had one my perspective changed drastically. Since then, the only time I really smoke is with my boyfriend. It's still everyday but we average between one and five depending on the type of day. When I feel like I shouldn't smoke, I leave my pack in his car and the cravings are at a minimal. I do have cravings sometimes, but I want perspective because I have one problem. If I have a good amount of money then I have an instant reaction to go buy a pack, like something takes control and Im on auto pilot when I do it. So how can I stop myself from buying a pack?

TLDR : Only smoking for about 2 and a half months, how can i stop myself from rationalizing everything and going to the store to buy more?

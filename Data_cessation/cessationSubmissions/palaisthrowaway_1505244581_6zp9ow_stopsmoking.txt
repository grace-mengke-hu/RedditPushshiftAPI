One Month - How do you live with yourself?

I'm one month into quitting and although I've completely rid my body of nicotine, every couple of days after work, the desire to smoke hits hard.  I've been ignoring it up until this point.  My body doesn't need it, I'm well aware of that.  But I really just miss the act of smoking and I still get that pang of excitement, the butterflies in the stomach when you know it's time for a cigarette.  I miss the ritual of waking up and lighting up on the porch with a cup of coffee.  I miss the cigarette in the car on the way home after work.

My question is, how do you live with yourself?  What do you do to fill the void?  I'm sick and tired of hearing positive coping mechanisms like "just take a deep breath" or "exercise!"  None of that helps me and I just think it's dumb.  Vaping did absolutely nothing for me when I tried.  It only made me want a cigarette more and kept my body full of nicotine, making the cravings more powerful.  My best course of action personally, is ignoring it.

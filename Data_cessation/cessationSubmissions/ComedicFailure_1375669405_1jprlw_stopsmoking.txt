I am going to have my last cigarette tonight. Starting 12AM Eastern 8/5/2013 I will be smoke-free.

I've been wanting to quit for weeks now, longest I got recently was 5 days. Longest I got today was 16 hours. I don't want to smoke anymore, and I think posting it up and recording my progress might just be the best way. Wish me luck! Those cigarette cravings are hard to ignore sometimes....

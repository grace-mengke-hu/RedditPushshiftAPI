Quitting has become contagious in my home!

I'd smoked for roughly 4-5 years, gave up on the 29th of December, down to only a couple of cravings a day! 

My giving up convinced my mother who was a smoker for 30+ years to give up. Im at day 41, she's just passed week one and I can honestly say giving up has had such a positive influence in both our lives, now just to work on my dad! 

This community has really helped both of us, I read her some of the posts on here for motivation.

Couldn't have done it without you guys, so from a long time lurker, 
Thanks a bunch and good luck!

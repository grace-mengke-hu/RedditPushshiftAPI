Hey reddit. 26 f wanting to quit. On day 1. Motivation/tips welcome please.

Hey guys,

I've smoked for nearly ten years now (god that feels weird to admit out loud), and I need to stop.
It started out as a teenage thing that gradually turned into a habit. 
I've tried a bunch of times, gotten through day 1 until night time, and then eventually cave and head over to the cornershop to buy a pack.

What's making me really want to quit this time is my boyfriend. 
He doesn't know I smoke. And yes, I've heard it said many times before "If he's a non smoker, he'll know"... I've never snuck off to smoke when with him, and will always shower etc before I see him, so he never gets that "just smoked" vibe from me. 

Still, I know it'd crush him if he knew I was hiding something from him. I don't even think it'd be the smoking he'd be most bothered with, it'd be the lie. 

So I'm going to try quit. Even now, typing this, I can feel my heart racing and that nagging little voice in my head saying "Oh just go buy a 10 pack, you can just have one or two and save the rest for when you're on a night out"

So... help please?

thirty-three hours smoke-free

A week ago, my coworker texted me saying we should make a pact--not a resolution--to quite smoking.  Started Tuesday, officially, and we finished our last cigarettes the day before yesterday.  Wednesday, about 11am PST.  I don't know that she'll keep it up because a year ago, she wanted to quit, but she didn't involve me at the time...

I haven't smoked since Wednesday and that's the longest I've gone without a cig in forever.  I want to quit, I am deadset on quitting, but it's hard and miserable and being dedicated isn't preventing me from being a hot fucking mess and crying over my laptop.  Today's my birthday, which probably makes it a little more terrible--that little lizard part of my brain keeps saying I should've waited, but the only thing I'd get from waiting is this misery a few days down the road.  I'm already breathing easier, if we ignore the mood swings from hell, so that's sort of nice.  Definitely in the 'pro' column.

Basically, what I would super love at the moment is suggestions on how to keep from going back to smoking--spite is a powerful motivator, but any advice at all is welcomed.  Contemplating vapes, but I want to get this nicotine thing over and done with ASAP.  Advice/recommendations/whatevs, it's my birthday and I can cry if I want to but I'd like to get over this crutch with as little misery as possible.

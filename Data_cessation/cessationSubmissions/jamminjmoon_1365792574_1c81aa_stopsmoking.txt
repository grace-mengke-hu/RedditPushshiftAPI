HELP! 2 days in, and an unexpected nightmare occurred

So I'm at my husbands cousins wedding and we are staying with the aunt and uncle. I am 2 days in to quitting and have not had a setback yet. But as we walked in their front door, where I'll be staying for the next 3 days, I realize that not only are they both smokers, they smoke inside their house. I'm 10 minutes in and feeling like I'm going to explode. Suggestions? Help? Anything really....You guys are great. I've done well so far, just one more night to go....wish me luck

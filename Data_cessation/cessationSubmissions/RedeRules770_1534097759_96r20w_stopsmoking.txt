Quit date is tomorrow

Probably should have picked the end of my work week versus the beginning, but the hope is that during the day I'll be able to keep myself preoccupied and any time I feel the urge for a cigarette break, I can just go and cuddle one of the dogs or go on a cleaning spree. 

I know I'll be an irritable cranky bitch. Any tips for how my boyfriend and I can survive the next few days/weeks? Lol

I will be free!

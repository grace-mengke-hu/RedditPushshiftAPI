I caved...

Let me start with some backstory. I'm 18 and I began smoking at 13 when I was 17 I stopped because my girlfriend at the time  hated that I smoked daily so I threw my pack away. That was 10 months ago. Anyways I was working today and I was having a shitty day and I was out on my last break and one of my co-workers offered me a smoke and I caved and decided to have one and now I feel really guilty about it. I let myself down hard tonight. So I'm just wondering when you guys are having a day or stressed and you really crave a smoke what do you do? Any help would be greatly appreciated.

What is a NON smoker?

I've continually had a disagreement with a coworker on what constitutes being a non-smoker. I am 38 days strong with zero nicotine, my co-worker is an avid e-smoker and claims no nicotine. His argument is e-cigs do not count since there is no tobacco or nicotine and therefore constitute a non-smoker title. I disagree. My argument is no form of smoking (Cigarettes, E-Cigarettes, Vaping Machines) is allowed to hold that title. Opinions? Agree/Disagree?

24+ Hours in again

So I quit smoking in november, and relapsed in march. My quit went very smooth and I enjoyed my new smoke free life, but I let my guard down and figured one cigarette every once in a while wouldn't hurt. Two weeks later I was back at a pack a day. 

It's time to reaffirm my commitment to not smoking, so I have also reset my badge. I know I can do this, I proved that to myself in november. Stay strong people!

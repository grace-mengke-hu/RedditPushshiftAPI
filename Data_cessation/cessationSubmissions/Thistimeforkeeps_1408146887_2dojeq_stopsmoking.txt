This week my husband was diagnosed with lung cancer

It's terminal, he has months to live.  He stopped smoking after 40 years, 9 months ago.  He was so proud of himself and I was proud of both of us.  But it was too late for him.  If this post makes one of you fence sitters make the decision to stop I will be so happy.  If someone was thinking about giving up on the quit please think again.  I don't want any of you to go through the pain we are going through right now.  He is the light of my life and we are not going to grow old together.

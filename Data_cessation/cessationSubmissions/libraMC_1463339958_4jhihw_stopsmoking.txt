150th day today and I feel great!

When I posted on here before it was always because I was missing cigarettes or because I've had a really bad craving but this time it's different. 

I can honestly say that I don't miss smoking at all anymore! It feels really great to be a non smoker, if any of you are still smoking and think about quitting, just do it! 

It's absolutely worth it, there are literally no negatives!

Stay strong guys and thanks for all of your support :)

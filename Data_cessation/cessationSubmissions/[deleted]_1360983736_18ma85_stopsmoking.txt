I turn 30 in one hour and I don't want to smoke anymore.

This will be about my 10th serious attempt since I started smoking at age 16, but I've been feeling very motivated for the past few weeks to do this. While 30 is a relatively young age, I'm getting too damn old for this disgusting habit. I'm not suicidal, yet I've been knowingly killing myself slowly for the last half of my life.

I only had three cigarettes today, and right now I don't even mind the thought of never touching another cigarette again. However, I'm afraid that come tomorrow I'll say fuck it and convince myself that just one won't make a difference... and we all know where that leads. I wish I had whatever it takes to just quit on my own, but I know from past experience that I don't. So, I'd like to ask for your help. Reddit, please help save me from killing myself with cigarettes. In time I hope to pay the favor forward. Thank you so very much.

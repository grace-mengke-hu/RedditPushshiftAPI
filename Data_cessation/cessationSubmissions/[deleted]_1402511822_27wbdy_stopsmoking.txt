Almost 60 days, cravings becoming more frequent.

I quit cold turkey, no book, no documentary. 

My girlfriend ran the London marathon, and I thought if she can dedicate all those hours to training, and completing the bloody thing, I can certainly go without cigarettes. So when she crossed the finish line I screwed up the pack and threw it in the bin. 

I have recently moved house so have been finding lots of ways to keep myself occupied. But the cravings are back, and I can't tell if they are worse, or more frequent, than the first week, or just seem to be because it's been so long.

Just a reminder that it's important to stay on top of it. 

Mind you saying that I would love to know if I'm over any sort of hump yet, in terms of getting to a point where cravings completely subside.

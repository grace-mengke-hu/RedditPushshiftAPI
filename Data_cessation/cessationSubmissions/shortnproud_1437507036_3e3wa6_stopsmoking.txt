Ways to help quit?

I've set a quit date for 7-27-15. I had recently quit for a little over a year, but this last September there was a lot of concern about losing my job(part of the company closed down). The day of the meetings i broke down and bought a pack of cigarettes. Luckily i didn't lose my job but i was already hooked again. I know its not good for me and i want to quit. I was wondering what are some good ways to get through the withdrawals. Also what are some things i could do to help me get through stressful situations in the future, since that is usually what makes me start smoking again? Thank you in advance.

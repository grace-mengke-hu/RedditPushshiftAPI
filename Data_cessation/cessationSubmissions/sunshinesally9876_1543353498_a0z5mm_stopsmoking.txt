Will I always think about it?

I am doing okay, day 11, but am concerned that I am constantly for the rest of my life, going to think about smoking. When I wake in the morning my first thought is that I can’t smoke, throughout the day I am continually thinking about and dealing with not smoking. I don’t want a smoke and I am proud of my achievements so far but am concerned that smoking is going to continue to control me even without lighting one. And although I don’t want a smoke I feel like my subconscious is trying to make me have one :(

Motivation for quitting.

I was wondering if anyone knows of a site that has pictures and stories of smokers.

I've been trying to quit for a while now, been smoking for about a year.

Once I saw pictures of people laying in their deathbeds, looking majorly ill, at that moment I ripped up my cigarettes and threw them in the trash.

So, I was wondering, does anyone know of any resources like [whyquit.com](http://whyquit.com)? They have some pretty powerful stories and pictures on there, but I'd like to bookmark some more in case I get the urge, then I can just go back and remind myself why I quit. Thanks!

I really want to quit.

I have 2 cigarettes left and I don't want to get anymore after this.

I'm 26 and have been smoking off and on since around 18. Consistently the past 3 years. I've tried quitting in the past but give up after one day. Something stressful always happens and I just say screw it I'll quit later.

I'd like to be able to say I can just quit and deal with it but that obviously hasn't worked so I'd just be lying to myself yet again.

I know no one on here can make someone quit but I could use any support I can get.

I can't afford to keep smoking. Both financially and health wise. My sons two now and I don't want him seeing me smoke and thinking its ok to do or have to deal with me getting sick later. Maybe I just need to type some of this out instead of just telling myself this in my head. I dont know.

Congrats to anyone who read this who has successfully quit. Its a serious accomplishment. Fuck cigarettes.

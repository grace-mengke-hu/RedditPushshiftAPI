One week!

I'm very proud of myself! On the quit front, I feel pretty great. I'm also a little loopy. Turns out I tore an intercostal rib muscle from bronchitis coughing. So the doc gave me a pain medicine prescription so that I can keep coughing out the crap without the discomfort. Feeling kind of swimmy from the meds almost made me think about smoking once or twice but I'm far too content laying around hacking up pretty colors from my quitter's cough in (relative) comfort to even really consider it. And my boyfriend has been so amazing, fetching me juice and soup and pretending I'm not super, super gross. Things could definitely be worse! 

It's felt really good the past few days to get a craving and just feel "meh" about it because I know now that it will pass. This sub has been so helpful and I really appreciate you guys :)

Let's not smoke today.

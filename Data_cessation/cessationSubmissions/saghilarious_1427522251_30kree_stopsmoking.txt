Didn't even last through day 1.... ADVICE PLEASE.

I had my "last cig" around 4 a.m, and managed to get through half my shift at work until my break at 6 p.m. I'm so disappointed in myself. I only lasted 14 hours. This is the first time I've ever really attempted to quit, so that's the longest I've gone without a cigarette in years. I kept thinking about how much better I would feel after I smoke, and how I would most likely cave in when I got home anyway. I was able to talk myself out of it until, like I said, my break. Bummed a cig from my manager and went home and PIECED TOGETHER THE 4 PACKS I BROKE IN HALF THE NIGHT BEFORE. Since I have no money until Monday, that's all I have. 

Anyway. Super disappointed in myself. I'm trying again tomorrow, but I guess I need advice on how to resist those intense after work, late night cravings. They're super intense from 9 p.m-2 or 3 a.m when I finally pass out. Mostly from boredom because I'm usually just on the computer or watching netflix, chain smoking. 

I felt really good actually before I caved in. Was in a great mood, even with the internal battle going on in my head and the physical anxiety.

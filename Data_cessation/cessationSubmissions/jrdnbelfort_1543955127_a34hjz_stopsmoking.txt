Quit smoking - my experience + please help!

Hi fellow redditors,

I just wanted to share what I experienced the countless times I tried to stop smoking. I am only 20 years (smoking about a pack a day since 4-5 years - started really early sadly) but I can feel how every single cigarette does affect my health in a negative way. Of course this is just my personal experience and is not for everyone, but if it helps even one of you guys, im happy. Because as many people here know, trying to stop smoking costs a lot of energy.  I tried some different methods:

*  **Electric cigarette**: It seems to help a lot of people. I think it would have been a suitable way for me too, but my lung just could not handle it. I coughed like crazy all the time, even after multiple weeks, so I just went back to smoking normal cigarettes as usual. But I know some people that could quit completely by switching and then just reducing the nicotine over the time. If you have problems concerning coughing, it seems to go away after a few days for the majority of "ex-smokers". If not, you probably have too much nicotine in your liquid or you are allergic to PG and should try a high-VG liquid (if you care about that, just google it). Or you are just like me. But it actually helped even me not to smoke regular cigarettes for about a month. Going straight to a non-nicotine liquid did not work for me either, it just made me want a normal cigarette really bad.
* **Herbal cigarette**s: I actually never tried those, but I heard they taste super awful and smell like weed, so not really suitable for me to use them for example at work. If someone has experience concerning those things, please feel free to share it with me.
* **Nicotine chewing gum**: It sucks imo. Did not help me in any way. It tastes awful and causes a weird feeling in your mouth/stomach because of the nicotine. I couldn't stay away from cigarettes for even one day using them. 
* **Nicotine spray**: Well, same as with the chewing gum. Tastes awful, leaves a weird feeling in my mouth. Concerning the craving for nicotine it definitely works better than the gum, but does not help with the psychological part.
* **Trying to reduce the amount of daily cigarettes**: No chance, it just made me want them even more in the long term as I had to deal with craving all the time.
* **Quitting cold turkey**: Well, obviously that's what most people did here. I could stop for about four days quitting cold turkey for two times, the last time was from Sunday morning until about one hour ago, when I eventually just gave in and smoked one. For me the withdrawal symptoms are really strong, I can think about nothing else all day until I just give up. Also I am in a really bad mood all day which sucks because I have to deal with a lot of (potentially annoying) customers all day, not to mention my coworkers. One thing that makes it even harder for me is not knowing when those symptoms will stop. I read it starts to get better after two weeks, but man, that's a long period of time :( If you have ANY tips concerning this method please share them with me.
* **Allen Carr's Easy way to stop smoking (and a German equivalent to this book):** This also seems to help a lot of people, some even say it made them quit without any struggle. It is definitely worth a try for you guys. For me, sadly, that is not the case. It definitely helped me change my mindset and wanting to quit even more, but not enough, kind of. The basic message of the book is that smoking is not a "bad habit", but a full blown addiction to a really bad and unhealthy drug.  It is available on audible, if you don't want to spend extra money on it or are to lazy to read it.
* **"Stop smoking"-apps:** They are a nice motivation If you already stopped, whenever I craved a cigarette in the last 4 days I eventually opened the app and read some facts about how bad smoking is and looked at the amount of money I already saved. For 99 cents or even for free its definitely worth downloading.
* **This sub:** I have mixed feelings about it. It motivates me a lot, for example the guy that posted a picture of a cup of blood he coughed up made me quit instantly for 4 days (I hope he is doing better now). Does not sound long to some of you but it is a really really long time for me. I can also read a lot of motivational texts from some ex-smokers here. But on the downside, I read a lot of things like "the first two months are like hell" which makes me think "oh my god, I'm only three days in and I want a cigarette so fucking bad, how the hell am I supposed to do it". I know what those guys say is true and the problem is my mindset, but nevertheless it makes me feel like the best option is giving up. 

One important fact is also that eating more is not an option for me, as I am really overweight and actually dealing with it by doing omad. For the guys that don't know it, it means you fast for 23 hours and then eat a huge meal in one hour. There is a whole subreddit about it. Probably sounds crazy to the most of you, but it is the first diet that seems to work for me... and what makes me sad is that even maintaining that diet (for me as a food addict) is a lot easier than to quit smoking :( 

One thing that demotivates me a lot is the fact that smoking even one cigarette immediately destroys all progress that I made. If I would fuck the diet up for example, I can just start fasting again as usual and it's not really harder than before. If I smoke a cigarette after some days of abstinence, I don't have the energy to stop again for at least a week. 

I am really thankful for any tip you guys might have to change my mindset or maybe another method to stop smoking eventually. I hate it and even after four days of not doing it I could feel that breathing was easier and the food was tastier.

Have a nice day and thanks for your opinions and tips. **Sorry for the negativity in this post.**

I will try to quit cold turkey once more when I feel ready again - hopefully forever then - and keep you updated in the comment section.

AWWWW YEAH... Monday-Monday non smoking.

Made it through the week, and then through the weekend! 

Real major for me to make it through the weekend - had a long mixing session Sat night which normally means plenty of smoke breaks and lots of beers.  Another reharsal on sunday afternoon, still smoke free, pretty pleased with myself!

I'm feeling a lot better today, I've been on edge/irritable all week but I think I'm starting to even out a bit.  Onwards!

300 days today! Statistics and a little backstory

For the statisticians, that's 300 days x 16/day = 4800 cigarettes not smoked x $1.20 per cigarette = $5760 not spent (smokes have taken yet another price hike in Australia since I quit). 4800 x 5 minutes = 4800 x 5 minutes = 400 hours more to do the things I want to do, without counting time spent buying cigarettes. With the extra time and extra money, I have bought a new mountain bike and some running gear and I now cycle and/ or run every day. 

If you think you couldn't give up because you've been smoking for too long or worse, because it's too late for it to make a difference to your life, consider this: I smoked over a pack a day for over thirty-five years. In the last couple of years I smoked just under a pack a day because I was trying to 'cut down'. (it didn't really work, the cravings were always there, I just let them be for fifteen minutes before I lit up.) I read Allen Carr's Easy Way to Stop Smoking and I was done. Just like that.

If I can do it you can do it :)

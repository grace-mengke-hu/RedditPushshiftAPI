Need Advice

Hey there, 

&amp;#x200B;

I have read through many posts wherein people describe how they quit cold turkey and how hard the journey have been. I have been smoking for the past 7-8 years and also had a chance wherein i left smoking for a period of 1 complete year in between but as my plea would suggest it recurred again. Nowadays i smoke 5-6 sticks a day. Deep down i know all the problems it is gonna create for my health and every other thing, but i am not able to leave the habit. It is as if i feel comfortable smoking, being alone in a corner, smoking thinking something random or going through my Facebook feed. I know its annoying for you to even read but find it as a fellow rant from a wannabe quitter who cant seem to find the motivation. Feel free to drop in and share some anecdote of how you would have coped with this situation.

It's been 6 months and I just had my first cigarette dream again.

I remember the dream.

Don't even know how it happened. I was at my brothers house. Managed to get a hold of a cigarette. Put it in my mouth, smoked the whole thing and I said to myself "not that bad"

It actually tasted like ass. I hated it but my brain is still playing tricks on me. Thankfully, I don't have cravings anymore so there's no need to start smoking again.

Woke up feeling incredible again that it was just a dream.

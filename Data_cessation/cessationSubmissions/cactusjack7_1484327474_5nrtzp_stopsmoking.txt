First week smoke free.

Jeepers. What a week. Have been struggling. First couple of days were the worst. Haven't had much to do which has made it worse. Start my new job know Monday which will hopefully make it easier to not think about having a ciggy. Finding watching TV extremely hard. Sitting still or just trying to do nothing and relax frustrates me. 

Does it get easier? As in it already has after the first couple of days. But will I forget about it?

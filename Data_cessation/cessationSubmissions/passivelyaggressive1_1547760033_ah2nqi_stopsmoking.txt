How did you get through the first 24 hours?

I'm ready to quit. I'm sick of it. Its terrible and expensive and disgusting and I'm over it..But that habit is so deeply ingrained that I struggle and quickly cave whenever I try to stop. 

I just want to make it through day one.. And I feel like such a failure that I haven't been able to.

What helped you most to get through your first smoke-free day?

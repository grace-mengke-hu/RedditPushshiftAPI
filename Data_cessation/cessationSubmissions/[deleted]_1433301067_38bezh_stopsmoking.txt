Alright Guys, I'm finally calling it quits.

I've been smoking since I was 16, I'm 21 now and I'm sick of it. I just want to be free from smoking and not have something controlling my life and killing me at the same damn time. I've been "trying" to quit for a while, but now i'm actually going to stop smoking. No more excuses and I feel like posting this was my first step.

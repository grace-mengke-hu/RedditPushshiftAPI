4 weeks!

Wow, can't believe I made it four weeks already.  Truth is, I actually forgot last night when the 4 weeks ticked until today, which means I'm not constantly thinking about it anymore.  Feels like I'm almost home free, though I know I still need to stay vigilant.

This was probably my 6th or so try at quitting, and honestly in the beginning it was the roughest (I had strong cravings within 15-20 minutes after my last cig an felt 99% sure I was going to fail) out of all of the attempts until that point, but I timed it during a three-day weekend.  First two days were when I had work, and then I had 3 days where if I got a craving, I could sleep it off.  This ending up being my key to quitting.  Just get past the first terrible 2 or 3 days, and set it up so you can sleep if you need to.  Of course, not everyone can do this, but it worked for me!   I quit cold turkey by the way.

I've been severely cutting down on drinking (drank once in a month) as well, and I've recently purchased a road bike and have been riding that a lot, so overall I feel 100 times better than a month ago.  I do have a question for others who made it to a month or more though:  Do any of you yawn like crazy?!  I read that is happens after quitting smoking but it's really out of control sometimes for me.  It's making everyone think I'm bored of them, and isn't exactly what my bosses want to see haha.

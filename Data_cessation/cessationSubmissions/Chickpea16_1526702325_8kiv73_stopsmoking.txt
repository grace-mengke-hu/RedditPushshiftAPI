I actually hope that I am getting sick

I am three months in to my cigarette sobriety but somehow my cravings seem to be getting worse lately. I think that it could have to do with the warmer weather. My addict brain has been telling me that summer just isn’t the same or as good without cigarettes. I went out drinking with some smoker friends last night and the cravings were so strong.. I have a vape but was honestly fiending for a cigarette standing there with them. The good news is that I think I am getting a chest cold so hopefully that will chill my cravings out for a bit and remind me of what is really important and how copd will feel if I don’t stay strong.

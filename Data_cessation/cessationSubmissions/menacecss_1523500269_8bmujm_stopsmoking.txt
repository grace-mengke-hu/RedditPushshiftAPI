Not trying to quit smoking, but get away from the devil: Nicotine.

Hello guys!

I'm glad, proud and happy for all the guys here trying or succeeding at quitting smoking. BE PROUD!

I'm here because I'm a big smoker (30 cigs a day + joints sometimes) and I really love smoking and I don't wanna stop.

Being in Central America right now, lots of the joints rolled by me are with tobacco, and not easy to share here as nobody smokes tobacco...

And I know nicotine is the devil, so I'm asking here if you have some ideas or things you were passing by to reduce smoking or nicotine before quitting.

I'm searching for a mix of herbs without tobacco, to smoke with and without cannabis. After some researchs, passionflower, lotus blue/white and damiana are the most common.

Did you try it? How was it? Some other ideas ? A perfect mix in mind?

Thank you in advance and keep going, you will achieve your goals. love you all

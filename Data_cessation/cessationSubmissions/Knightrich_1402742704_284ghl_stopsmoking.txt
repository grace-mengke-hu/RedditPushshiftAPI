12 weeks!

So it's been 84 days since I posted on this subreddit asking for help and feeling pathetic for doing so. I was so filled with anxiety over the thought of quitting and felt like if I tried and failed again then I'd feel too defeated attempt it again.When I got home from work, I gave my tobacco to my grandmother and told her "This is yours, don't ever let me smoke in this house again" and a daunting feeling passed over me. I was so full of doubt that my willpower would crumble that I felt the only way to cure my anxiety would be to have a cigarette.I told my friends not to let me smoke around them no matter how badly I wanted to and I gave them full permission to slap me as hard as they wanted if they found me with a cig in my mouth. I hate getting slapped, so that was enough incentive for me."Don't become your own disappointment." has become my motto over these past 12 weeks and every time the cravings came I forced myself to resist and told myself that it's never going to be worth giving in. Eventually I started to believe it.When I'm out with my friends and they ask me if I want a smoke, I can tell them "No thanks, I don't smoke." just like I did when I was younger and no part of me feels the urge to accept their offer, and for me, that's a massive victory.The best part of this whole thing is realising that I have the ability to give up a notoriously hard addiction and it has encouraged me to try. I've pushed past my anxieties and applied for college and quit my shitty dead end job. I received my note of acceptance in the post yesterday and I couldn't be more excited.Don't give up, because the end justifies the means and after it's done, it feels so damn good. Physically and mentally. Good luck to you all and thanks for the encouragement!

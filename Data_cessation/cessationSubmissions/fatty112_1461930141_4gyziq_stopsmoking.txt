Quitting for my health

I've been told I have excess stomach acid, most likely caused by too much drink, drugs etc (i'm a student, we drink a lot). However, to sort myself out i've been told I can't consume alcohol, fizzy drinks, spicy food, obviously drugs and tobacco. So here I am attempting to quit for my 3rd time I believe. Last time I lasted 2 months but relapsed when drinking with old friends.

P.S: I love the little badges, always nice to know how long you've gone.

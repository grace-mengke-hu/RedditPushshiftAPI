4th Day Quitting-- Some Strange Effects

I'm on my 4th day without smoking. I wore the patch for 2 days and decided I'd just go cold turkey. Ever since the first day I've been feeling quite a bit different than I thought I would. 

Along with an intense craving for nicotine, I have a number of other symptoms:

- Panic 
- I feel that I'm getting TOO hot, like I'm getting heat stroke
- Dizziness
- Increased anxiety and obsessive thoughts (I have OCD)
- A feeling of constant excitement in my chest, like when you eat too much sugar or caffeine. It's almost like I feel TOO good, like I overdosed on a drug or something.
- I feel disconnected from reality (like I'm dreaming)
- Racing heart beat

I'm really concerned. I want to quit smoking, but these don't seem like the kind of side effects people usually experience. I do take medication. Maybe it's reacting differently without nicotine?

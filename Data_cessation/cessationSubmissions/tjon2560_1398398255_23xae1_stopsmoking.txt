It is seriously time to quit smoking.

Smoking will not help you with anything.  I am craving one right now, but I know if I smoke...it will only settle me down for maybe ten minutes and then I will want another.  Just one more is never enough!  

I can't give in.  I can't give $5/day to a cigarette company who actively seeks to manipulate me, to make me addicted, and destroy my health.  

I looked at this stop smoking app on my phone today.  It said in 14 years my risk for heart coronary disease will finally be as low as a non-smokers.  14 years?!  I better damn stop smoking right now.  

Recently I read on Askreddit, "What is real freedom?"  Someone answered, "Self-actualization. Period."  That inspired me again.  Why is it so hard to self-actualize?  Just do it!  I want to be a non-smoker.  I will be a non-smoker.

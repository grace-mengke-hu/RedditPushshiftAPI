Best Alternatives/ urge fighting aids??

Any recommendations on alternatives? Or atleast what do you do when you have an urge to smoke?

I eat salty food (crackers, nuts, or chips) every time I had the urge but been trying to cut down on salty food recently as well.

Some recommend nicotine gum/patch. If that's the best you can recommend, then which brands are best and what's the best way to use them? Some recommend to proactively take gum or put patch, but some also say that take the gum only when you have an urge.

Non conventional methods of fighting the urge will also be greatly appreciated.

Peace to you all, please help me because this love (of smoking) is starting to take a toll on me

Feel like smoking again....

I feel like smoking again. It's been 9 long days and in that time it's approaching mid semester for me, so i have a bunch of tests and assignments due and I'm just so distracted. It's hard to find the motivation in me, i feel myself slipping into old habits as the stress of all this stuff is keeping me from going to sleep on time and going to the gym in the morning. I'm about to go outside and buy a pack of smokes. I've been fighting with myself for the past 5 hours about not going to get a pack of smokes, and honestly i'm getting no work done and it's just making me stress out more. It doesn't help I need good grades to apply for medical school...

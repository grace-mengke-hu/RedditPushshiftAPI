I want to quit, but it's the only thing that gets me through my job. Advice?

I started smoking when I was sixteen. I'm twenty now, and I average about 12 a day. I'm also mentally ill (depression, anxiety, and BPD), and as much as I hate myself for smoking, I use it as a crutch to keep myself calm and functional throughout the day.

I work a horrendously stressful retail job. I restrict my smoking to one at most during my shifts, but by the time I clock out, I feel like I need one **right then** or I'm just going to have a panic attack. I desperately want to quit, but I don't know how I can possibly handle the withdrawal symptoms and work at the same time. I have a history of not handling stress well. I'm in a specialty position, so taking a week off isn't really possible, and my hours aren't flexible.

On the other hand, I could put quitting off until January. I plan on leaving my job at the end of the holiday season &amp; living on the money I've saved up while going back to school, so the environment will at least be slightly less stressful. The thing is, I'm afraid I'll lose my motivation before then and end up smoking for four more years.

So, people who are more successful and well-adjusted than I am, how do you do it? How can I quit smoking without completely imploding everything else in my life? Thanks in advance, and sorry for how obnoxious this probably sounds.

I think smoking has affected my brain significantly. Is the damage permanent?

I feel that, in the years I've been smoking, between 17-24, my ability to reason and think clearly has been progressively impaired. It's getting to the point that I genuinely am worried that I'll be this way for the rest of my life because of my fucking stupid habit. My mood is bad, my temper is a lot more erratic than its ever been. It feels like my head is full of sawdust.

Has anyone else experienced this, and is this effect going to be permanent or long-term?

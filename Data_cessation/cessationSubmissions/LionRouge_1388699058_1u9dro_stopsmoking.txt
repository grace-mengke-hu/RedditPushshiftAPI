Day One and Tea Tree Oil Toothpicks

So I'm quitting (again. My longest was for 7 months a few years ago) and want to commit this time, because I don't want to be that old lady sitting on park bench smoking and looking like she knows her life took a wrong turn 30 years ago.  

Does anyone have an experience with Tea Tree Oil toothpicks? A friend who was a long time smoker and quit cold turkey swears by them, but I wanted to see if anyone had any other views. 

Remember the first three days are the worst three days. We just need to power through.

Quit smoking since august 24th! A major tip that helped me!

Hey guys, i would love to give you a tip from my personal experience. We all know that smoking is bad but in a way we all love it. The first step that helped me quit was to set my mind on that i am not doing anything hard by quitting smoking, im just going back to normal. I promise if the voice in the back of your head says its not hard to quit it wont be! Good luck to everyone and I wish you all a healthy life! Belive in yourself!

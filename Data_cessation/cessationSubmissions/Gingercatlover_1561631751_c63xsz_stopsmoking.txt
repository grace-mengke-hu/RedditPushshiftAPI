Had a slip up

On day five of my quit journey as my partner and I are wanting to start our family soon. Partner decided to quit too and has used ecigs whereas I’ve found it easier to go cold turkey. Last night partner gave up and purchased a pack, I got home from work and ended up having a few puffs and a few cigarettes throughout this morning, but every time I have any now even a small puff I feel so sick, actually nauseous and dizzy. I think it’s my body’s way of telling me not to do it, it’s had enough. Just wanted to get this off my chest, I feel like I’ve messed up, but I really don’t want to continue being a smoker anymore.

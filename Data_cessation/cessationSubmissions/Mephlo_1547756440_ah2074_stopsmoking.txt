Food anxiety advice?

Hi guys! A month ago I landed in the hospital due to a pneumothorax and since I spent one week without smoking I just decided to keep going. Now, my question is, how you people handle with the eating anxiety (or at least we call it like that in Spanish)? Mostly when I'm at home I'm finding myself making trips to the kitchen even if I'm not hungry. 
I've been thinking about making myself some smoothies or similar, that way I can fill up myself with something healthy, but the optimum would be to just stop. Any advice?

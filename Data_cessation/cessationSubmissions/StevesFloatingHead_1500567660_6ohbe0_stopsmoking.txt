Day 1

People probably post a ton of these.  I'm just dropping this in here because announcing it to *someone* makes it more real to me.  I've smoked on and off for 30 years and I've quit before for as long as nine years.  I have lots of tricks for giving them up, but to me the hard part is just staying focused on my intent.

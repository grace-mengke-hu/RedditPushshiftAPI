I wanted to post about my 1000 days smoke free. But I missed it!

So here’s to 1,001. I don’t count days anymore, or watch an app. The only reason I realized was because I’m still subscribed to this sub and will occasionally come in to give encouragement or congratulate you on your victories.

Smoking is just a distant memory now. You can be here too! I smoked a pack a day from age 17 til 30. That’s 13 years of my life! Anyway- it’s all worth it. All this struggling you’re doing... I promise, it’s all worth it!

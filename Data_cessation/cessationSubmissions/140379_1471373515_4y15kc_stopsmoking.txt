Neighbor's second hand smoke dangerous?

I've successfully quit smoking around 6 months ago. I share a terrace with my neighbour(separated by a little wooden wall). This dude smokes 24/7. He comes out for one at least once per 40 min on average. All his smoke goes directly through my open window. At first the smoke didnt help with quitting as it was quite tempting. For the last 3-4 months (after addiction fully went away) it just smells and makes me feel fucking digusting. Like, when the smoke comes in I just want to stab him in the skull with a pencil or something.

Anyway, I'm not gonna tell him how to live his life, all I want to know is this second hand smoke still dangerous to me (considering I've been a smoker in the past myself). I will be moving in a few months, but it is so fucking annoying to choose between smelling cancer all day or having the window closed at 30 degrees C.

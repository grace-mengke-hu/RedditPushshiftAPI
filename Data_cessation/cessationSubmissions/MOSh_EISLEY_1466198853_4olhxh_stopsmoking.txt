Two years, bitches!!

Can't believe it's been so long, I never thought I'd get here but I hardly think about them anymore. To anyone that's struggling, or thinking about quitting.. DO IT AND STICK WITH IT. It literally pays off. My trick: I set up a bank account transfer, and every week I transfer the amount of money I used to spend on cigarettes into savings. I've made over $3k by simply not smoking :)

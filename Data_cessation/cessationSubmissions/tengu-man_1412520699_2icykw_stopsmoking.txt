I drank last night and I didn't smoke, despite craving it badly!

I don't really drink anymore, but I had a party last night. I had those horrible drunk-smoke cravings, but I didn't give in. (I also realized I'm such a lightweight now, lol.) To me, last night was an achievement because I had not craved cigarettes that badly since 1-2 months into quitting.

Day 5

Day 5 of no smoking and I feel pretty great. Ran a 3.5k yesterday in a little under 30 minutes. It's a long way from where I want to be but miles ahead of where I was a few weeks ago. I sat there at the end of it and felt like I found the answer to what was missing from my life- that need to push myself and break out of the day-to-day routine. 

I'm glad I discovered this group and the incredible stories of people trying to overcome a considerable obstacle. Your support means a ton to me and I will keep updating as time goes along.

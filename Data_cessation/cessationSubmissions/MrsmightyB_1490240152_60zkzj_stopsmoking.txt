I just tossed all my cigg supplies again.

I smoked my last one about 10 minutes ago. I bagged up all my lighters and butts and tossed them. This is my third try. The first time I did vaping and gum and had  huge problems with depression but I quit for a year.  A few months ago I tried to quit with vaping and I hated it.  I don't want to replace smoking with vaping or chewing gum and patches.

 The first time I quit I started croche and made a blanket  and some smaller projects.  Now I'm on a different path having lost weight and doing workouts. 

Just now I opened my glove box looking for a cig. Not good. 

So, what do I do in the morning to replace my cig habit?

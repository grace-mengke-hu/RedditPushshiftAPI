Having a tough time. Any tips?

It has been a few days since I decided that I am going to quit. I got the 2nd step patches (14mg /24 hours) because I figured it'd be easier than cold turkey and I could deal with less nicotine than step 1 (21mg / 24 hours). But I feel like this patch isn't doing much for me at this point.

I don't like how the gum tastes and that scratchy mouth/throat feeling it gives me. But I'm strongly considering getting some to ease the cravings I'm having. So far I've just been trying to occupy my mind by chewing regular gum, munching on veggies, and eating sunflower seeds. 

Any advice on how I should proceed?

Being strong in the face of anxiety.

I know this belongs here but whether or not it gets any traction matters to me very little. I am in a state where my best chance of relief will come from reinforcement of the ideas I accepted 1.5 weeks ago.
Smoking is a terrible habit. It will end my life sooner than I accept. It makes me accept conditions that are unacceptable. It makes me pay less attention to the things I need to take care of because it satiates my desires. And it's a filthy, disgusting habit that weakens me rather than making me stronger. Of all the reasons to quit smoking, the one I simply cannot, will not, make excuses for is the last one. I desire to be great. To improve the world for the sake of the people around me. Destroying this habit is the key to a greater world in my eyes.

Right now I am experiencing some anxieties related to the withdrawal. It's been about 1.5 weeks and I have been strong the entire time so these came as a bit of a surprise. I found that breathing deeply, eating, and laughter at the challenge improve my feeling of well-being. I am committed. I am a non-smoker. I don't smoke. It's not my style. I want to live my life to the fullest.

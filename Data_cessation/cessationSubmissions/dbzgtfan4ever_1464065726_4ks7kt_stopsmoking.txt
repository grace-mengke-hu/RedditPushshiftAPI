Had to remove my badge. Was at 1738 days today.

Technically, I started smoking again this past January. My friend came to visit me, and he picked up a nasty chain-smoking habit. I resisted for a very a long time, and it felt so easy. But then I had a moment of weakness, I asked him for a cigarette, and it was over. I've been smoking ever since. I hope to one day become a non-smoker again.

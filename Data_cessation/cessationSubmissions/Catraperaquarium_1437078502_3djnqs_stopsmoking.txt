Going to quit and need some help.

I'm not a long time smoker, just smoked for 2-3 months. When i grab a Cig, i feel really bad and fear for my health. Not sure if 3 month smoking would make a difference for medical conditions but i don't want to take risks. I need your help on tips that can help me avoid more addiction. I really want to stop smoking and I made a promise to myself, but I know it won't be easy. How can I avoid buying another Cig?

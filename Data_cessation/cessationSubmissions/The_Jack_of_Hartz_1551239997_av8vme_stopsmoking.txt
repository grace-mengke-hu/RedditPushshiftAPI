What worked for you?

I'm 25M and I've been a smoker for 6 years. In fact, the 6 year anniversary of my very first cigarette is coming up, Feb 28th. I've gone up and down but mostly I smoke 3/4 to a pack a day. And I need to quit.

My wife is 32 weeks pregnant with our first, and she quit smoking, cold turkey, the day she found out she was pregnant. She had been smoking a pack a day for almost twelve years, and has been nicotine free (minus about 3 slip ups in the first month) since August. Pregnancy complications and possible birth defects are one hell of a motivator. 

As for me? I'm struggling. We both agreed that I needed to quit before our son was born. We decided that we wouldn't try to quit together so that the combined effect of hormones from the pregnancy and the irritability from withdrawal wouldn't cause divorce or murder/suicide. But now... it's my turn to kick the habit.

I tried cold turkey, and it lasted all of a day. The gum and lozenges give me the hiccups. The patch makes me break out into a bright red rash. I've seriously considered vaping, but I need to be able to justify spending $$$ on a kit. I need to know that it'll help me wean off cigarettes.

So my question is, what worked best for you? Am I doing something wrong? What is the best way to kick this stupid, expensive, and deadly habit?

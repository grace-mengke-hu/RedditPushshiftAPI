Shower thought: I know I really quit smoking when I can watch Mad Men without craving a smoke.

I've been binge watching Mad Men again and I've noticed I no longer crave cigs as I watch them smoke every two minutes. I remember first watching the show last year and I'd smoke every 20 minutes as seeing them smoke made me crave it. I guess I'm really smoke free now huh?

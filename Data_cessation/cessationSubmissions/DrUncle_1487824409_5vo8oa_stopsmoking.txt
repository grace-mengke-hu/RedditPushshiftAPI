500 days smoke free!

I stopped paying attention after I hit my year mark but visiting the subreddit I noticed it was day 500 for me!  Still never think about it, zero impulses or desire, have lost the 10 lbs. I gained after quitting ... in a lot of ways it's as if I never smoked.  I've also noticed I've gone over a year without catching a cold which might be a record for me.  I still subscribe to this subreddit though because I love hearing other people become successful in killing the beast.

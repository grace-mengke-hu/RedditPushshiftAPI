Hitting a bump in the road....

It's been 42 days since my last cigarette and all was going great until about a week ago. I love that I can finally taste and smell again, my wallet is full, I smell great, and I don't have to freeze my ass off just to destroy my lungs. However, I'm finding it extremely difficult to deal with stress. I've returned to college from winter break to the most intense semester yet along with a roommate dead set on making my life a living hell. I'm getting more stressed and anxious than ever before to the point where I have constant headaches and stomach aches. I've still managed to stay strong but the cravings and urges to break down and buy a pack are getting stronger and more frequent. Do any of y'all have any coping techniques that helped you deal? I know I'll be disappointed in myself for relapsing but I'm starting to feel like the constant stress isn't worth it! Please help!!

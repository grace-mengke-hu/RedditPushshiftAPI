Tomorrow is my quit day...

I've been mentally preparing for this day. I've smoked for about 12 years. I'm 29 years old with a wife and kid. I'm so ready to do this. I've dramatically cut back the last few days. There are times were I just dont know what to do because it's time that I am usually smoking. I'll find stuff to distract myself. Does anyone have any encouraging words, tips, or things to avoid for me? Thanks in advance.

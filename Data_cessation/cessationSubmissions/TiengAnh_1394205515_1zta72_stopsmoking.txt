Day 3. Nicotine fits have decreased in intensity though not in frequency.

Is that normal? I swear the craving is lasting longer. It's not as intense, but they're lasting about ten minutes each, about once an hour. So far I haven't given in, and I don't intend to.

I'm on the patch, but can't feel it; I can't tell whether it's helping or not. Has anyone else felt like that? 

Anyway, just wanted to brag. Now I'm at 72 hours free!

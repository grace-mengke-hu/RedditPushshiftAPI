Everyone here is strong enough to quit

Hey y'all, I hit this sub through the random feature, and I wanted to give everyone some encouragement. I quit February 12 2012, and it's been hard these three years.  I haven't relapsed and I work with smokers. I want everyone here to remember we, as humans, are capable of anything. ANYTHING!  Tell yourself you can quit, be positive, and know that the occasional cig isn't losing.

Need motivation

Hopefully this post isn't too long if so I apologise in advance . Ive gone through 8 days now. Never made it this long. Been smoking 30 years. Been trying off and on to stop for a while now. My problem is I have no motivation to do it. Personally I deal with anxiety and depression. Smoking puts a dent in it.  And not to sound morbid I'm not afraid of death. The whole you will live longer thing doesn't do anything for me. Not that I want that to happen but to me my thought is we all die.  I have seen people with emphysema COPD etc and that's the biggest reason I can come up with for quitting. Living like that must just be terrible and I don't want to go through that. I have the smoke free app. I exercise. Through various therapy sessions in my life I understand the deep breathing techniques but so far that's just not doing it for me. I am wearing the patch for about 14 hours a day. Can't take it when I am trying to go to sleep. Going through maybe a 1/4 of a juul pod a day. So the cravings have not been a problem. My biggest problem is mental. Inhaling that first drag I can't get out of my head. So anyway there is tons of advice out there about dealing with the physical cravings and I think maybe I'm ok with that. But how do you deal with the psychological ones?  One more thing I know they say you have to want to quit. It's more that I need to and I think that's part of my problem. Thanks in advance and you all are great motivators. Been reading this every day since I started and am inspired by all of your stories!

One cigarette a day; the final plunge to freedom.

How do I make it? 

I've been reading Allen Carr's Easy Way. I've been making healthy choices elsewhere and even getting exercise in. But making the jump from one (even a couple) to none seems the biggest jump. 

I've even gone for a couple days without any but they just pull me back in. I can tell myself there are no physical withdrawals, I think I know all the benefits, yet I go back.

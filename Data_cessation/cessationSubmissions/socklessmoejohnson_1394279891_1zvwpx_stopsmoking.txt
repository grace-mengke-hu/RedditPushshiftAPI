Just dropping by to say, keep it up guys!

I'm not at any milestone or anything (and to be honest the longer you go without the less milestones seem to mean anyway) but I just wanted to offer my support to what everyone's going through.

/r/stopsmoking and getting a badge was a big part of what helped me quit so you've come to the right place. Good luck!

Everything smells horrible, food tastes amazing [Day 2]

Two full days without tobacco, but a month of gradually cutting back before that (I was down to two cigarettes a day for the last week- one in the morning with coffee and one after dinner). I was smoking a pack a day up until August. I smoked lightly for about three years from the end of high school until I graduated college, once I was out of school my smoking went out of control. I think quitting is going to stick this time. The two biggest short-term motivators are money ($16/pack) and bad breath/clothing odour. Cutting back first rather than going completely cold-turkey I think was what has really helped. Being in university now has been a great help to quit too because funds are tight and I have lots of stuff to do and keep my brain-bucket stimulated.


That said, did anyone else notice that everything seems to smell goddamn awful once they quit smoking? I am hyper-aware of the smell of bad breath and body odour, especially coming from smokers. I can smell bad breath on people from like ten feet away. I am studying a subject that involves a lot of fieldwork and there's a couple guys in my class that are kind of grubby (they're still in the camp-life "roughing it" mentality even though they're in school), which didn't bother me at all at first, but now their body odour almost makes me sick.

Yesterday I am in a computer lab and a girl is sitting beside my usual workstation with her steel-toes and socks off. The nicotine cravings have made me feel pretty snappy recently and it took all the willpower I have not to say anything. The smell of her feet were awful and overpowering. Who the hell takes their shoes off in school? Gross.

Now on the other hand, food tastes better than it has in years, so that's a plus.

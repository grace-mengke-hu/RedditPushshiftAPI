I am drunk and I really want to join everyone else smoking outside right now. Please help me remember why I really don't want to.

I just need a little help to reinforce the don't do it. It's hard. I'm alone and pretty sure I could make friends if I went outside and bummed one. I would really appreciate help right now.

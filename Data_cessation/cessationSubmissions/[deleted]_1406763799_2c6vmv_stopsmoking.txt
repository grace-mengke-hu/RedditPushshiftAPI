Quit 18 days ago. I'm having some issues and need some guidance

Hey Guys,

I had an old account that I had posted in here before, but I deleted it so..yeah. Quick background - I've been a smoker since I was 12, I'm 24...

I quit smoking 18 days 20 hours and 20 minutes ago (Longest I have ever gone). I read Allen Carrs book for a third time and really emphasized the enjoyment and pleasure he endured after becoming a nonsmoker. I found the first 5 -10 days to be nothing but marvelous. It was so EASY! However, lately I have become irritable, mean, stressed, unfocused and just a straight up dick. I can't even find enjoyment with my dog (I live alone with him) and I just keep snapping. I'm curious as to what I should do? Obviously, I don't want to quit, but at the same time at least I wasn't a complete piece of shit when I was smoking. Anyone else have this problem?

TL;DR: I quit smoking. I loved the process. Now, I'm an asshole and I can't keep my cool or my shit together. Suggestions?

One Thousand Nine Hundred

Super Bowl Sunday and 1900 days totally free from the slavery of nicotine addiction. If you're new or if you're struggling, never give up. Just don't have a cigarette today. Then remember, it's always today.

I smoked a pack and a half a day for 40 years. Tried and failed every possible way to quit. Knew deep down in my heart, I'd die a smoker. Thanks to Allen Carr's book, I'm finally free. Never stop quitting, find what works for you.

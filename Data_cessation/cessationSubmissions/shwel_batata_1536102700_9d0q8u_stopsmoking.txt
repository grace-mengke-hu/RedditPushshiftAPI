I found yet another stashed half a pack.

I’m staring at it now. A few days ago, I found a loose ciggarette in my purse and destroyed it and now I found one cleaning out the cupboards. I know I can do it but I feel like the excuses are so convincing. I would really appreciate being talked down from the ledge. 

Can someone help me deconstruct these convoncing arguments?

- Just one and throw the pack.

- Your mom is coming in 3 weeks, are you really not going to smoke one for old times sake?

- 1 cigarette won’t do much in the grand scheme. 

-Ive earnt it after 11 days.

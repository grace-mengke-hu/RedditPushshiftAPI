Am I going to feel this way forever?

Hey guys, I quit smoking little over a month ago now. Al since then I've been extremely irritable, my thoughts are always negative, I am just an asshole...please tell me I won't be like this for the rest of my life....I began working out everyday..I just don't know what to do to curb this...it really really sucks. I'm just not me anymore, especially with my girlfriend..

Today was my first day in the gym after 6 years.

I have been down with serious anxiety/depression and god knows what else for last few years. I was scared, there is no reason why I should have been scared of stepping out of the house but I was. I kept preparing myself to go to the gym everyday for last one week but my mind kept coming up with a reason to back me out of it at the last minute. 

Today, I did not listen to my mind sabotaging me. I faced myself and got my ass to the gym. Everyone around was very helpful and motivating. I started with an empty bar but what the heck I did it and am tired AF. 

To all you guys who are thinking of taking a step in any direction but see yourself just thinking about it and not doing it. DO IT. You will thank yourself later. Trust me. I can't stop smiling lmao.  

The lifting advise is real. If one workout day can do so much, I cannot wait to see what weeks/months of lifting will do.

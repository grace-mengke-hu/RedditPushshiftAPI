What methods have you tried to quit smoking?

I’m part of a bio-tech start-up company in Southern California. My partners and I are working on a few projects that aim to tackle difficult biological issues (pain-management, hair-loss, etc.)

I have 3 close relatives that have struggled with giving up cigarettes, so that drove my interest in our newest goal: to create a topical, effective smoking cessation aid.

We’ve managed to create something that can be applied topically and has shown to be more effective than nicotine replacement therapy (nicotine gum, patches, etc.). I know quitting isn’t as simple as taking a pill or rubbing something on your skin, but I’m confident that what we have will help people achieve their goal.

 

I just want to say that we aren’t trying to sell you anything, this is just in the development stage. I know many of you have quit/are trying to quit, so I was wondering if you could help us guide our endeavor. We’re wondering what smoking cessation methods you have tried, how effective they were, and what you think about our potential solution.

 

If you could take a few minutes to fill out this survey, I would really appreciate it.

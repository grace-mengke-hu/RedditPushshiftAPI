I went 5 days without a cigarette

And I ended up buying a pack tonight because of some anxiety. I can feel how messed up my lungs are and it feels awful. This constant chain of smoking/quitting is getting tiring and discouraging, and now I have a full pack to go through before I'll try to quit again. Any advice?

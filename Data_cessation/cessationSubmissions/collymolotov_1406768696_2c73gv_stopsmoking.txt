Quit smoking, just wrapping up my third day. Been more or less tolerable so far, but what should I expect?

I finished my pack after a Nine Inch Nails concert on Sunday night and, since I didn't have any left and realized I'd been smoking more and more lately, that I should probably quit while the quitting was still possible. So far it's been three full days without a cigarette, the most I've had in years.

A little background:

-27 year old male from the Toronto area

-I work in law (paralegal/court agent/process server) so I'm on the road a lot and in stressful work environments the rest of the time

-I like me a good drink but I definitely wouldn't say I'm an alcoholic

-Went from enjoying weed in substantial amounts daily to once every 10-14 days in very small amounts a few months back.

-Started smoking cigarettes when I was 17-18, was mostly a pack-a-week smoker until about a two years ago, lately I'd been going through a pack every 3-4 days, like a weekday pack and then a pack on weekends.

-I smoke when I'm driving, after meals, when drinking, when I'm angry, when I'm lonely, when I'm sad, when I'm frustrated about my life. Unfortunately, I feel all of those things fairly often.

Anyways, I figured that if I wanted to make this a successful quitting effort, I should probably join this community and get some advice support. I've been without a smoke for 72 hours now, and aside from some trouble sleeping its been going alright. What should I expect going forward?

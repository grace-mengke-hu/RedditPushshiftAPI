12 days in - Freaking out

Hello,
I have stopped smoking and have managed the last 12 days. I am going cold turkey. My trouble my GF has stopped at the same time and is considering having one. We are both stressed right now as our dog has been ill. He is back at the vets tomorrow but was sick this morning.

Anyway should I power through and be resolute and say no to us smoking or should I just cave and start again after my dog gets better?

I just don't know what to do. My heart says power through but I am very stressed!

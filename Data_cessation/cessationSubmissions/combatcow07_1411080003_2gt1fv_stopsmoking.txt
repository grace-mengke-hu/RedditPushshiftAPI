Help with quitting at work?

I posted here a few hours back, whist I made the decision to quit whilst I was at work.  A lot of people at my work place have switched over to these E-cigs and vapor. I've tried them before and they didn't really seem to help me, so I've gone cold turkey. Just replacing the urge with chewing gum. So far, my boss has offered me some of her fags several times over and I've managed to refuse them- even whilst stating that I'm trying to quit. I've refused so far, but I still have 9 hours left here. I feel like one day or another the urge is going to get me here, at home and out I feel like I can handle it. I'm worried that I won't be able to kick the habit because of work. Any advice?

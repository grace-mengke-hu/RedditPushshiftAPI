I almost had a year...almost.

I was at a music festival and a tobacco company was giving out free  cigars.  I was drunk, and seeing all of my friends get a free cigar really kicked in the cravings.  The next day, I bought my first pack in over 300 days.  A few days later, I bought a second pack.  After I finished that pack, I told myself that I wouldn't smoke ever again, and that I had to stop now.  The longer I smoke, the harder it will get.  I'm three days in, but still disappointed in myself.  Don't ever think that you're beyond temptation regardless of how long ago you stopped.  Hopefully tomorrow will get a little better.

No smoking at concert venues/NFL/baseball field (MN)

Went to a concert with some friends this past sat. Two of my friends are smokers. The concert was held at our professional baseball field (MN Twins\~Target Center) They would not let anyone out to smoke. If you left you could not come back to the concert. My friends were livid! Then we were told by someone else we were with that our professional NFL field does the same thing. When I heard this I was instantly happy that I am no longer a smoker. It is nice to see the world starting to make venues and there property non smoking. I hate to feel that way because yes just over two years ago I was a smoker but it's the truth.

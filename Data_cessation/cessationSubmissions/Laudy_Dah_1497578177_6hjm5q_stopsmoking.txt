Take two!

In February of this year I started my first attempt of quitting after 11 years of being a smoker (26 years old) I got through the first three months, and then slipped up one night while drinking. I threw the remainder of the pack away and picked back up for another few months doing well up until last week where the same thing happened. Only this time, I made the mistake of smoking one the next morning sober. I ended up smoking and buying new packs this entire last week and thought how crazy that was after all of these months of doing relatively well. Today I've decided "no more" for the second time this year. I didn't know about this community the first time around and am very optimistic about being successful this time now that I have found this new support!

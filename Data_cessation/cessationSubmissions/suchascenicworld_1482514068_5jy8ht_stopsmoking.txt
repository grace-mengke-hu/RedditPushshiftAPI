I am back home from the holidays and its been a year since being here last. Is it wise to quit over Christmas?

Hey everyone,

before getting into things I wanted to provide some background. I successfully quit in the past and I remember how amazing it felt. For example, I felt healthier, did not feel like I was a slave to cigarettes, and it felt awesome to fly abroad and not think about cigarettes while being on a plane! But, I relapsed a few times.

So, the current situation. I currently live in UK (from US) as I am doing my PhD. My supervisors told me to take these few weeks off as I am kind of a workaholic and I sometimes burn myself out. Additionally (and I know plenty of you may feel similar), 2016 was probably the worst year in my entire life and that is without exaggerating. I literally feel like a shell of my former self. But, I am trying to change things.

1. I am going to see a therapist as soon as I get back to UK

2. I am going to begin working out (cardio)

3. I completely changed my appearance as I was so down in the dumps that I didn't care on how I looked (for some reason, a haircut felt really symbolic)

and finally..I want to quit smoking and given that my work load here will be minimal, I thought it might be best to do so while back home. However, it is the holiday season and I am not sure if its the wisest move to make. Does anyone have any insight regarding whether I should do this now?

Thank you

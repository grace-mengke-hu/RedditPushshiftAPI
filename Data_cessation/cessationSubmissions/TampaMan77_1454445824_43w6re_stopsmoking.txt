Day Two!

Sunday was my 39th birthday, I told myself that I would not turn 40 feeling as bad and be in as bad shape as I am now. I made a promise to my 2yo son and to myself to use this next year to better myself. I chose Feb. 1st ( the day after my birthday ) to begin this journey and so far it has been tough but I have gone about 40 hours without a single puff of a cigarette. Any and all advise on how to continue to get through these next few days would be greatly appreciated. BTW I am going COLD TURKEY!

Four weeks, finally throwing stuff away

I've been gradually finding my nicotine gum all over the place.  Home, office, truck, and I throw them away now instead of saving them "just in case".  I am saving the unopened NRT to donate if and when a coworker/friend wants to quit.  Can't just throw away like $50 :-P

I also pointed out to my wife that I have officially survived her entire menstrual cycle without a smoke, and that is an accomplishment on its own.  She was amused.  Sort of.  :)

Two Months Today!

 I can definitely tell my lungs are clearer. I have not had to use my asthma inhaler for two weeks and I can hike straight up a hill for an hour without having to stop and catch my breath every five minutes.

 I've discovered that the store brand nicotine patches work best for me. Don't worry, I plan on going off the patches in four weeks, as scheduled. Four more weeks, and I will be nicotine free.

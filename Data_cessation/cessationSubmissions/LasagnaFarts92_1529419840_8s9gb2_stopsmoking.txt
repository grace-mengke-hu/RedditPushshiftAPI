I just wanna say thanks

I haven’t smoked in 6 years and some change. But these past few months are testing my limits. Every time I walk into a gas station, every time I walk past the smoking section at work, i want to give in. I almost bought a pack a couple minutes ago. It’s hard. I just came across this sub and it’s givin me a little more motivation to not give in

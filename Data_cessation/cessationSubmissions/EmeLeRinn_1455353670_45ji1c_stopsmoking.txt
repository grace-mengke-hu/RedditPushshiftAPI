I came up with a plan that I think may just work for me!

I love blowing bubbles. So much in fact that I think it may be my replacement for smoking. Along with the aid of an inhaler. 

Y'all may think I'm crazy, but there is a method to my madness. As silly as it sounds.. 

After hitting the inhaler, go to my basement and blow bubbles for a few minutes. Blowing bubbles is so calming and satisfying to me. Hopefully I can just go less and less inhaler, and more and more for bubbles... I don't care where I am. I will keep a small bottle of bubbles in my purse. I will have different kinds of bubbles hanging around the house Bahahaha. xD 

I have a 5 year old daughter who can actually come with me on a bubble break!! We can bubble together. Inside!! No secondhand bubbles! Unless they pop on you. Lol. That thought makes me happy. 

I'm actually going to attempt this. Thoughts?

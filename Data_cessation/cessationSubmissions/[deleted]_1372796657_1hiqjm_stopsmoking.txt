I need to get back on track. I was doing so good...

I had quit previously for 57 days. My motivation was my girlfriend who insisted I did not smoke in order to be with her. I hid it from her and got caught several times. Now she's gone. And I'm smoking now. My mind is strong but my body is weak (I think). I need motivation from within and when I look inside, right now all I see is sadness. Have any of you been where I am? I feel weak without her. I feel weaker every time I light up. Pay no attention to the tag, I've not kept up with it due to shame... I really need some encouragement.

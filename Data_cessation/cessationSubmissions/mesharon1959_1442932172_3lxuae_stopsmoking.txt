Today's Progress Report

I've heard people say that sex is better as an ex-smoker.... is it better for women as well as men, and if so, why? Just curious.

Going through the whole constipation/gas thing right now (sorry TMI). Any suggestions?

Also - LOVING the money I save! I was spending nearly a car payment every month on cigs!!

I have now stopped smoking for 2 weeks, 3 days, 15 hours, 52 minutes, 50 seconds. That translates into 353 cigarettes NOT smoked, for a savings of $92.72! At 5 minutes per cigarette I have increased my life expectancy by 1 day, 5 hours, 26 minutes, 10 seconds.

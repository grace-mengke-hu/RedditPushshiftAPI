3,5 years clean now. Never give up! Thanks!

The first year I thought I was incurable after 20 years of heavy smoking. ( from 11 - 31, heavy tobacco, rolling paper, 30+ a day)

But it gets better. Stay strong. I think it took me 2,5 year to be really really free. 

I see it this way: quitting sucks, its hard and not fun. But it is the price we have to pay. You never get away with anything. But thankfully we have a chance to pay the price and quit. 

Do it. Be strong, dont cry. Dont overthink. Never argue with yourself, you will lose. Be persistent. 

3,5 years ago I loved this sub. I read a lot. The writing from you all speaks to the good parts of our brains. It really helps to overcome the more emotional/addicted parts. Thanks again!

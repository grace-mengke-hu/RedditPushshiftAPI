Weird pressure on upper body.

Hey guys, i couldn't find an answer anywhere so it took me here. I quit smoking 4 weeks ago and smoked one cigarette last week at my uncles funeral, so actually i kinda stopped last week. I now have a strange pressure on my torso or lungs. Its a feeling like i need to yawn to get enough oxigen into my lungs and i have to force deep breaths. I probably should visit a doctor but did anyone here experience this?

Is this normal?


I have started coughing up this disgusting mucus, loads of it!  It is grey in colour and big clumps,  I was expecting some stuff to come up but it's only just starting happening and I feel worried about the amount,   Is there anything I can take to help it?  Should I be worried or is this what normally happens?
Ive never quit for this long before so never experienced this and I feel scared my lungs are totally destroyed.
I would really appreciate some advice

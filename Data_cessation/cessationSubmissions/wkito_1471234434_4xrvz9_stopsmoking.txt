Bloody phlegm back of throat?

Ex-menthol smoker, currently 40 days off smoking, longest time I've ever had. So I'm not coughing up blood but when I brush my teeth and stick my toothbrush back some, you know that still smoking phlegm grossness still around a little. But it is red and bloody quite frequently. Is this a common thing or common to menthol smokers?

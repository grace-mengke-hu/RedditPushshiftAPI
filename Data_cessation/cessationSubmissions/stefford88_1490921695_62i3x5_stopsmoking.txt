Starting right now

This is my third (serious) attempt at quitting. In 5 hours I am boarding the plane for a 10 hour flight to Portland, Oregon. Since I'm not able to smoke on the plane, I might as well quit. I'm planning to read the book by Allen Carr on quitting and got the Smoke Free App. I am looking forward to get inspired by you. Thanks for reading!

8 days smoke free!!

Hi all. I am new here. A friend actually told me about this (Thanks brotha). I have smoked on and off for about 20 years. I quit for about 3 years and made the mistake 2 years ago to "have just one".  I was smoking in my apt 8 nights ago and realized how rude that is for my wife whom doesn't smoke. It was time to stop. The worst when trying to quit for me is when I have had some drinks and I smell the smoke. Well I got one week yesterday and tonight that exact situation happened. So it might not seem like much (8 days) but that hurdle has been overcome. Thanks for reading!

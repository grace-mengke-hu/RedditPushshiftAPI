Day 11 Down

Hi all. I am (was) a pack a day (32F) smoker and quit cold turkey with my SO 11 days ago for the first time after 15 years. 

I feel like I'm getting through the physical cravings well and the benefits are definitely showing. Breathing easier, stopped coughing, saved $260AUD already, etc

The hardest thing for me is sadness. Like something is missing. It doesn't even feel related to smoking but it started within a day of the quitting. Just wondering if this is common and how long will it take to lift because I don't want to start again.  Cheers :)

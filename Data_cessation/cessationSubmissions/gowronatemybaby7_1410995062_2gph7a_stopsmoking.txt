Why is it getting harder?

Tomorrow will be the 3 week anniversary of my last cigarette. I smoked ~3 packs a week for ~ 6 years prior. I quit cold turkey. Not a drag in 3 weeks. I feel really accomplished. But...

My cravings are getting worse.

At first, I'd have sudden, really intense cravings, at specific/ritualistic times. Now though, the cravings aren't exactly more intense, but they are virtually constant. I feel this dull persistent nagging craving basically all the time. It's like tinnitus you know? That soft, far away ringing in your ears that goes away after a minute or two. Except this is all the time. It's not going away.

Why is this happening and what can I do??

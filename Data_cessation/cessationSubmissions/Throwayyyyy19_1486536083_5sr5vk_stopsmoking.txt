Restless and hyperactive and sleepy after dropping nicotine, anyone else experience this?

I've been using an e-cigarette since late August and I just dropped down to 0mg juice a few days ago.   
  
I didn't make the connection at first, but I've been insanely "productive" in the last 48 hours. I feel like I'm having a manic episode! Running around to two dozen stores in an afternoon, starting a million projects and not finishing any of them. And then last night I went to bed at 7:30!   
  
I guess I'm not sure what I'm looking for here, maybe just solidarity. I'm not crazy, am I? When does this settle down?

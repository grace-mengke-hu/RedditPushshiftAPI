Giving this another try

Hey all, I quit smoking a few months back but unfortunately picked the habit back up after a few weeks. I've been having some shortness of breath continually since I quit. It has kind of scared me into trying to quit again. I picked up some 2mg nicorete gum and am gonna try to give this another shot. Wish me luck.

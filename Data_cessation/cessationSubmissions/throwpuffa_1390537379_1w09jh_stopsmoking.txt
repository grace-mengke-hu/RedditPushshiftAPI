Flew on a plane today for the first time since quitting and had an unexpected perk

I fly usually around 3-5 times a year.  Not that often, but often enough to notice in recent years that my feet and hands swell a fair amount in flight.  Not obvious cankles exactly, but enough that if I take my shoes off on the flight, I have a lot of trouble getting them back on.  I chalked this up to being in my 30s now, too much salty snacking on the plane, etc.  But I have to admit, it always made me a little uneasy.

But I flew today for the first time since quitting and... no swelling!  Zero.  Not in my hands, not in my feet, not on any other part of me.  Just one more reason I am so happy I'm done smoking.

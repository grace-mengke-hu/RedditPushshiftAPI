Spontaneous.

Hello.


I have been smoking cigarettes since I was 14 years old and now at the age of 21,  I decided to quit smoking. I made 2 serious attempts before, a couple of years ago and lasted 3 months without cigarettes but started due to stress and personal problems at that time.
Today 2 am in the morning I decided to quit. My decision was spontaneous, though I was drunk as well. Now it is almost 10 pm here and I manage. Hopefully I can quit for good!


However my question is, is it better to stop smoking prepared rather than spontaneous? Especially when going Cold Turkey.

What is your favorite quit smoking app?

I've been using QuitIt for iphone, the free version. It has a timer counting from the second after my last smoke, how much money I have not spent, how many cigarettes I have not smoked, how much tar I have not ingested. There are also health milestones, but after the first the milestones really slow down. 

Have any of you tried apps that you liked better than this one? What makes them appealing to you?

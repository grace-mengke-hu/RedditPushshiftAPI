A thousand voices are screaming in my head

I'm at 4 days, I've been doing okay but everything in my body is fighting against me. It hasn't been the easiest because I know what can make this stop. I've quit before will little success and I know how to make it all stop.  If I just smoke one cigarette - the anxiety, the tunnel vision, the confusion, the restlessness, the constant back and forth in my own head - it will just stop. 
It would be so satisfying and at the same time it wouldn't. As soon as I light up that cig I'll feel relief, followed by gagging and spitting and remembering why I quit in the first place. 
But I want it so bad. It would just shut up every voice telling me to smoke just one more cigarette.

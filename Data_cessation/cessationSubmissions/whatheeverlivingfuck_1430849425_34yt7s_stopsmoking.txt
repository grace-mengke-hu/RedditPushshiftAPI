Just started quitting

I'm on day 3 of no cigarettes, switched to a vape. I've smoked for about 7 years and just turned 22. I don't make New Years resolutions but I set goals for myself every birthday and my goal this year was to quit smoking. On saturday (just a day after I had set the goal for myself) I was hanging out with a guy and we were in his room. He actually had to go throw up because the smell of cigarettes bothered him so much. I know that's a little bit of an exaggerated response, but it really hit the point home. I took it as a sign.

The next day I went and bought a vape and haven't smoked a cigarette since. It's only been three days and I feel a little funky. I opted for a lower nicotine dosage in the liquid I bought and want to ween myself off the nicotine before I deal with the oral fixation (I also tend to over eat). 

It's been weird explaining to people that it's not for the guy, that was just the nail in the coffin so to speak. I'm also the only one of my friends that smokes so they don't understand the small victories of three days without one. I start a new job in a new city in a week so I'm going to need as much support as I can get. 

Stay strong fellow quitters, I hope I can post something a year from now saying I made my goal!

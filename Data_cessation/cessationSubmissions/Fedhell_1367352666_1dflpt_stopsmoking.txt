I had a cigarette today, day 4 of my quit.

I wasn't necessarily craving for one. But I couldn't stop thinking about how much I would enjoy one. All my coworkers were going out for a cigarette, so I borrowed one. It wasn't actually good. It tasted like crap and sent me into a coughing fit.

I guess I need to reset my counter, but if anything it has reaffirmed that I don't need to smoke. Has anybody else have that one smoke after quitting and realize that it didn't do anything good for them?

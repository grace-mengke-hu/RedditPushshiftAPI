Try to quit and looking for help.

I decided to make my new years resolution to be to quit smoking. I have been smoking since I was 21, around 9 years at this point. My family is smokers with no desire to quit which can make things difficult. 
I attempted to quit a few times but have not been successful and this time is no different. 2 days in and I haven't missed a chance to smoke. I have tried the gum and it didn't sit well with my stomach so I abandoned it and lit up. I do smoke weed but that is also costly and can't be done at work. I tried e-cigs and they didn't give the same feeling so I fell off the wagon.
My fiance is also quiting but she is good with being cold turkey, which I apparently am not.
I am a fidgeter and have to be doing something. What are some tips, apps, or products that have helped all of you.
What do you do during the times you used to smoke? What habit or hobby replaced smoking?
I am getting married in a little over 2 months and the stress is not helping. Currently the monetary and social aspects are what is driving me to quit and I have also noticed impacts on my health(nothing too major).
My fears are snapping and irritability as well as judgement if I fail.

Please, any help would do. My willpower has not been enough.

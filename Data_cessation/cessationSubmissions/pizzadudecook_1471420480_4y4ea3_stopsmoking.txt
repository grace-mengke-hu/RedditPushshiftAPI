Tried medicinal solutions before with no luck. Found out I just needed some real motivation. (4 month mark a week ago)

So I have tried the patch, gum, chantix and cold turkey with the thought of "I just want to be healthy" right? Well this last school year, I went with my oldest son to his track meet. It was a little crazy first thing in the morning. He had high jump and pole vault at the same time. The problem was, they were on the opposite sides of the field. Schools around here are pretty lax and let parents out on the field to help cheer on the kids and help out when the coaches need it. The boy was doing really well, but had to constantly run from one end of the field to the other. After the second pass down the field, I was really starting to lose my breath. I was able to make it just in time to watch him get his first place on high jump, but then it was time to make it down to the pole vault. He took off and I cheered him on as best I could and started making my way there. Sadly, I didn't get to see his final vault that got him first place there. He hopped off the mat as I trundled the last 30 or so yards and around a building to see him. He understood that I tried as hard as I could to get there, but I could see the disappointment on his face.



It pissed me off to no end, and that was the point that made me decide I was done. I have since taken up jogging with the boy (Well... As much as I can consider it jogging. The boy gives me some guff to work harder) and eating healthier. Here's to 20 years of beating the hell out of my lungs.

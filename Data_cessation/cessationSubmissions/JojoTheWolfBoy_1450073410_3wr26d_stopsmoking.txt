Pissed off at myself

I quit smoking from December of 2014 to March of 2015.  Today would have been a full year of not smoking, but drinking blew that out of the water.  I feel like I have to quit drinking or I'll never quit smoking.  It feels like it's damn near impossible to quit both at the same time.  Anyone else have to deal with this conundrum?

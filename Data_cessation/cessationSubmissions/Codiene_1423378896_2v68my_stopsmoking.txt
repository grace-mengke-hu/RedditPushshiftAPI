How to quit when my mom smokes in the same house as me?

Okay yall, I have been smoking 6 years and am ready. I have been on chamix and am almost done with the cigarettes.

Problem is even if I'm down to 2-5 a day from a pack, my mom smokes in the house and it's hard to quit when I am around it all the time. Any advice would be appreciated!! 

EDIT: you guys rock, I'm gonna keep at this! Thanks for ur words, I'm gunna beat this fucking addiction.

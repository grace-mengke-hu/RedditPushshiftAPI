This is hard.

Hi. So im trying to quit cold turkey. It's been 12-13 days so far since i stopped juuling, and the physical symptoms have obviously passed, but I cant stop thinking about it. I switched from cigarettes, which I am especially starting to crave. I become ravenous whenever I smell \*any\* type of smoke. I cant use patches or anything, because I am 17 (ik, ik, illegal and dumb...). Alt acc for obvious reasons. I get panicky every time somebody brings up vaping or smoking because I  want it so bad. How do I stop craving it this ravenously?

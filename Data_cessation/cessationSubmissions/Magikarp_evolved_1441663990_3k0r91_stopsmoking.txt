6 months and still going strong. Cold turkey. No e-cigs, no vaping. The secret: My best friend is my motivation and my support.

We've been together for almost 3 years and she has been my motivation to stay smoke free since I started not smoking. Dear god its been hell. The craving were evil. You could go for a few days and not a single itch for a smoke and then BOOM! Suddenly its all you can think about. Or worse., the scent of moist tobacco or someone smoking would twist your senses to the point of madness. But I've never gone back and I feel better than I have in years and its all thanks to her.

Everyone has a way to conquer it and for everyone, its different, but its very possible. Good luck!

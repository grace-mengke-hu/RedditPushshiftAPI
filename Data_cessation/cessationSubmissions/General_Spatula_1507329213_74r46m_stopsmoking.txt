Time to quit

Been smoking for 8 years. About 20 - 30 a day, time for a change. 

I really just created this as a way to keep myself on track, if I say I'll quit and update this I will at least try. I made it a day previously and then smoked normally. 
My addictive personality is amazing, but I did recently make the change from drinking coke etc to drinking only water and that was a change, plus I have been working out and need to lose weight. 

So let's go!

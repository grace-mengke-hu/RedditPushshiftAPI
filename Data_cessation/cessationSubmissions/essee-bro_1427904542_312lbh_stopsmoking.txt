Need a little bit of help/guidance/motivation

Hey all-

I quit at the start of the year and went ~90 days strong using the patch for the first 2/3rds of that time. I live a pretty social lifestyle. Drinking is common and as the sun has been out more recently my wife and I have been stepping that up a bit. Now, that started about a month or so ago and I had some wild nights where I didn't have a single cig. 

I was feeling very confident.

This past weekend, for whatever reason I let my guard down. For about two days I was in self-pity mode and continued to smoke about a fraction of what I had when I was full on. Now, two days later, I am still smoking. I'm feeling much better in my head, but still bummed as I watch myself slip back in to a more consistent habit. 

It has been four days of smoking at this point, and there is an event coming up this weekend (we will call it the Easter beer hunt) that makes me think waiting until the weekend is out for the next push might be a good idea. 

What I am looking for is feedback, suggestions, any comments you all may have as a community. 

I have considered going back to stage 2 of the patch and doing 4 more weeks. I have considered getting some gum instead to hold me over. I still think I can turn this effort in to my successful attempt, but I am slipping. Knowing that summer is right around the corner and patio bars will be common is a pretty strong deterrent. Even if I am not smoking I am going to be around it all the time. That makes me feel weak, when in reality I have proven to myself that I can handle it. 

I have also tried Chantix, David Carr and cold turkey. 

Do any of you have stories of success after falling off? Words of advice? Tactics I may not be considering? 

I bought some chewing sticks too but now I just chew those between cig breaks lol. 

What can I do to forget I ever failed in the first place? I feel like such a hypocrite for being so confident and anti-smoke then slipping back in.

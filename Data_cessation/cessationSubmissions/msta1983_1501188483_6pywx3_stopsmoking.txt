My Champion

My bestie and I went bar hopping last night. He offered to buy a drink to every smoker I encountered if they promised not to give me a cig ever! Really sweet! Really supportive! I love him so much. But something weird happened. One person did not take him up on his offer, instead took a few cigs out of their pack and started taunting me with them - you can have one more, think how good it's going to be after not smoking for a few weeks, I'll buy YOU a drink if you have a smoke. Seriously, this happened. Ordinarily that might have been tempting BUT I was so pissed that they were being such an asshole not just to me but to my friend that I took the cigs, broke them, and threw them away.

I just want to scream but I can't afford it.

Sorry for the rant. 

I get paid hourly for my day job so when I get sick I don't get paid. Between the office being closed the week of Christmas and having to take time off because I was so ill, I'm broke. On top of that I held a very stressful, time-consuming, difficult position for a show at a theater in mid December that I have still not been paid for. They just keep saying, "Oh, it'll be next week!" and then no response when payday comes and goes with nothing. And taking them to small claims court would be more expensive than the money owed to me. 

I'm so tired. The bronchitis is finally gone but my quitter's cough remains, which still hurts the torn muscle in my ribs. I'm working my hourly job again but I can't drive on medication so I spend the whole day uncomfortable. I'm still hacking up gunk and I'm more emotional than usual. I'm exhausted. And my addict is screaming at me that a cigarette will help a little.

I'm not going to smoke today. I didn't smoke yesterday, or the day before so I'm not smoking today. I *know* smoking won't help. I know it won't calm me down or put money on my pockets or get that company to pay me the money I'm owed. I'm just tired and angry and poor and my addict is mad that I'm winning. At this point I guess that I just feel so helpless and out of control of my life that what I put in my body seems to be the only thing I *can* control. So I'm exerting that control by *not* smoking. It just sucks. 

But let's not smoke today.

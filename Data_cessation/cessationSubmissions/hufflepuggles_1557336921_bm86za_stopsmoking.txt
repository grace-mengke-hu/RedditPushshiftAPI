Made it four days no smoking...

Hi all,
This is my first posting here. I’ve actually been a member a while, and I have this saved to my favorite sub lists.

I have been trying to quiet smoking for ages - and day 4 is usually when I end up buying another pack saying “I’m just going to smoke 1 a day since I can’t quite cold turkey”, then I find excuses to smoke the normal amount and promise myself “after this pack I’ll quit”. 

Really hoping today I break the cycle. I just got a gym membership, and I’m hoping this helps motivate me. I am disgusted with smoking, i wish I didn’t rely on it so much for fun/stress/anger/happiness.

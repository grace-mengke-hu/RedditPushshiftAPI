207 days

Its been 207 days since i last smoked. I tried 50+ times to quit before that i failed miserably everytime. Some time I relapsed within 1 day , some time due to alcohol , sometimes due to smoking frnds etc. I did a lot of reading about smoking, learned a lot from the experience of this Stopsmoking reddit group (TY :))  and kept on trying. some tips which you already know.
* First 3 days , take one moment at a time , dont think of days,months. Cravings will be gone in 3 minutes.    
* drink lots of water, eat fruits , have green tea.
* keep yourself busy, if you stress out do mediation.
* Do some exercise and dont sit home doing nothing.
* Read lot of about quitsmoking ,benefits , experinces, 
* Watch quitsmoking videos.
* try to read Allen carr's book , Easy way of quit smoking, best 
book. 
* try app get rich or die smoking.

Remember one day you have to quit smoking, why not today ? Never take a single puff. try to avoid triggers for 1st week like Alcohol, peers, situation, place. some benefits from my quit smoking.

30 days completed!ðŸ˜¤

I just completed one month with any form of tabacco. Be it cigarettes, juul or nicotine gums.

Cold turkey imo is the best way to stop smoking.

I had some hard times, when I was stressed or when I had a few drinks and thought about smoking but the idea that if I refrain from nicotine for some time, I can be completely free from it, kept me strong.

Looking forward to 50 days without smoking

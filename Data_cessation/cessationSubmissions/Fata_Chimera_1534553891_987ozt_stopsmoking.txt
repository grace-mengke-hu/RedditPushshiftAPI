Home alone nights, just wanna drink and smoke.

This has been the hardest aspect for me on the quit endeavor. I’ve been able to remain real solid while I’m at work and not miss nicotine much at all.

But god damn I get home at night and am so bored with all of it. I drink and smoke. And the sad thing is neither make me happy but it’s... something. 

I try to get inspired by the stories on this sub and I do deep down wanna quit. But shit am I bored when I don’t smoke. I’ve tried hobbies and distractions, bike rides and running. I love them but they only fill so much time and then I’m back to this.

I know I’m not alone in this mentality, this struggle, it’s damn real. I’ve tried the patch and other nicotine replacements and have had varied successes for finite times.

To the people who have really quit long term, what am I missing? I have been real close multiple times but have just never quite rounded that corner.

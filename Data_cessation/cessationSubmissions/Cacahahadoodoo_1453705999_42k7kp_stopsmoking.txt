Was clean of smoking for almost 3 months and ruined it tonight

Me and a friend quit together and you know we got past (what we thought) was the hardest part. For the past week we had been just randomly mentioning how great a cigarette sounded and same went for today. As it started as playful we both kept getting more and more serious about it and after a long day at work today we both finally broke. We bought a pack and smoked and I felt instant regret, the saddest part about it is I just smoked another one. I feel so shitty and even just after two cigarettes I already feel breathless(may be exaggerated) but anyways I just hope this post can help anyone out that has random cravings. It does not make you feel better to smoke again, it will only make you feel worse. May I add though that mistakes are made on such a tough journey and if it does happen we need to buckle down and just commit again. I took the rest of the pack a put it in my sick where I proceeded to soak them to a watery grain. I hope this is the last time I smoke as I try to remember how weak I feel.

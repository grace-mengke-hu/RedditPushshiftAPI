Dreams of smoking as I near 1 year smoke free

I'm 25 days away from being smoke free for 1 year, yet last night I had an extremely vivid dream that I was hanging with friends at some sort of all day event/party and decided that it was ok to smoke because I had come so far and had beaten addiction. The strange part was that my subconscious somehow knew it was a dream and it didn't bother me so I didn't feel guilty when I woke up. I smoked at least 3-4 cigarettes in this dream. It was probably the 3rd smoking dream that I've had since I quit. I think I had the dream only for the reason that I'm so close to the 1 year mark and it's just more in my thoughts lately. I'm certainly not afraid of relapsing as I've had many, many situations in the past year where I could have given in, but my will has been strong and I just don't ever want to smoke again. It's all about choice and dealing with the consequences of that choice.  Why go back when you've made it this far? I know negative life-changing events can be difficult to deal with and that causes a lot of people to light up again. But to me, that's a poor excuse and I'll use the old adage that two wrongs don't make a right. I really owe so much of my positive attitude and commitment to Allen Carr's book. I just really don't know where my mental state would be if I didn't read that book, but I'm sure glad I did.

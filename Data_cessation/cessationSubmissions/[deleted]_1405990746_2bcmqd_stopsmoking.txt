202 Days Smoke Free

Hello all. I actually found this subreddit several months after I had already begun my journey but I wanted to stop in and join the subreddit. 

After 10 years of smoking, I decided to try and quit (yet again) on New Years Eve. I had my last cigarette at 4:56 PM on Dec. 31. I have tried to quit so many times in the past I cant even count. I know how discouraging it can be and the "fuck it, im never going to be able to do this" attitude after giving in. Don't give up, because one time you decide to quit will be the last. 

Going cold turkey might not be for everyone but for me, I needed to do a drastic change all at once. I started an exercise routine, quit smoking, quit drinking (it was one of my triggers) and started eating healthy all at once. The exercise did wonders on stress and cravings, I started eating better but allowed myself sweets whenever I craved due to what I was really quitting and I gave up drinking for about a month while I adjusted to my new life without cigs.

Anyways, fast forward to 202 days later and I still smoke free. I would be lying if I said there are times that I dont think about smoking and wish I could but those thoughts are so fleeting and weak, they dont even bother me anymore. I would say my cravings are about once a week these days and it lasts about 30 seconds, if that.

there is hope for everyone. you just have to take it one day at a time. one craving at a time. and give yourself the praise you deserve when you resist those shitty cravings. it will get better over time.

cheers

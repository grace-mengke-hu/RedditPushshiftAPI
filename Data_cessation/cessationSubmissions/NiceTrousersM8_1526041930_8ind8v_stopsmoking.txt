A week for good news!

I quit smoking about seven months ago, partly because me and my partner decided to try for a baby and I wanted to do everything possible to help with that process. 

Well this week I found out that she's pregnant, so I'm going to be a Dad! I'm so excited, but I can't share the news with friends and family yet because we want to wait until the first scan, so I'm coming to you guys, my anonymous internet pals.

I'm so happy that I quit when I did, now I know that my child is going to grow up in a smoke free home which was so important to me. Now I know that I'm never going back!

Thoughts on celebration Cigars?

EDIT: **After going through comments and talking to myself [in a not crazy way] about it, I decided I'm going to have one with our friends. My fiance will dump me if I start smoking again anyways lol. We can't afford it.**

It's been over a year now since I quit cold turkey and haven't been anywhere close to a relapse [except once when I almost had a heart attack about possibly failing all my exams due to my laptop messing with me], and I just recently got engaged to my girlfriend.

We are spending a few days with some friends, drinking, socially hanging out, etc. I have no problem with drinking and not smoking [done it before], but my fiances sister just came back from the Dominican, and brought back some Cigars. We decided it might be neat to go ahead and have one with our friends for celebration purposes.

I am not weak willed in any way -- I literally dropped 10+ years of smoking after using a calculator on what I spent on smoking, but something tiny in the back of my head is nagging me, saying it's cheating. 

Just wondering what peoples thoughts on this are. I am not really concerned about getting the 'taste' back and wanting it, but I feel like I am cheating. Just wondering if maybe I am over thinking this.

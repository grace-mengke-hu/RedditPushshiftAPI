Rough today

Currently 44 hours smoke free but itâ€™s a rough day.  Woke up and immediately wanted a smoke ðŸ˜ž.  I am determined to remain smoke free but today is a tough one for sure.  Tougher than first 24 hours.  Currently using NRT cuz Iâ€™ve tried cold turkey before and it doesnâ€™t work well.  I always go back to smoking.  But I donâ€™t think I can use the patch overnight.  I read online that people have bad dreams when they wear it overnight.  Canâ€™t remember the dream but it was bad.  Woke me right up in a cold sweat about 2am.  So Iâ€™ll have to remove it before bed I guess.  Anyone else have bad dreams wearing the patch overnight or maybe it was just me and my mind

Road trip success!!!

...As most of us know our cars needed our help starting by us lighting up (ha ha) but I just wanted to say that I just completed my first road trip (8 hours each way) in 20+ years without smoking...I'm not going to lie, it was rough and there were all sorts of triggers but I made it...It's doable!!!

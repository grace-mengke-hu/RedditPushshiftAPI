If I cannot quit, then at least I can choose my fear...

As a smoker, fear is always at the back of my mind. Fear of running out of cigarettes, fear of getting sick, fear that I might drop dead in front of my little boy, fear of not having enough cash for lunch AND cigarettes, fear that people must think I am a trashy mother, fear that I cannot live without ciggies although they are killing me, fear that life will not be worth living without my expensive little crutches, fear that my boy will start smoking one day too, etc...


I've made my bed, I'm a smoker, fears come as part of the package. I will feel fear whether I decide to smoke or not.


I have grown tired of being scared of everything. I have decided to declutter my mind. I want to trim off these fears, keep the most manageable ones if I can't remove them all.


 In the end of the day, I can select which fear I want to feel:


1) not smoking : overall, the fear of withdrawal effects and boredom ;


2) smoking : the fear that I am going to choke to death sooner or later. 

I mean, when I put it like that, it became fairly easy to choose so I went ahead with fear #1 nearly 3 days ago. 


And the plot twist? it's nowhere near as scary as I thought it would be. Like, a little confusing and stressful but I have seen much worse. 


It sounds obvious now but the cigarettes created the fears. Remove the nicotine, you remove the fears. I don't even know how I managed to miss the point for nearly 20 years.

I don't even know whether this post can help anyone. I hope it makes sense at least? I haven't told anyone yet. It's such a non event. I can see clearly now, that's all. 


I'm still scared of the dark, though. The dark is scary. That's okay. I won't smoke again but the bathroom light stays on at night.

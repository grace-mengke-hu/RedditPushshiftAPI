A few hours shy of our first week without nicotine.

My wife and I completely quit nicotine a week ago (minus about 2 hours). The urges were rough at first but according to the smoke free app the nicotine is entirely out of our systems. What we notice most is that we miss the ceremony of it all. There's was a certain presence in the moment that we somehow were having trouble capturing over this past week. We'd go outside to sit on the porch and enjoy not smoking, reveling in our ability to breathe like teenagers again. Still, something seemed lacking. This is why we decided to get a zero nicotine vape. It's a complete waste of money, I know, but it's nice. I don't know about the whole slippery slope thing though. Any thoughts?

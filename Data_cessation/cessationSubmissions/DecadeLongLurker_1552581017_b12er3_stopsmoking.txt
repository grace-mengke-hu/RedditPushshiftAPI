I lost weight.

Five months since my last heart attack, four months since my last cigarette and I lost three pounds. Cannot get any exercise because of an injury, can barely walk. 

Shows what saying no to fast food, soda pop, Twinkies, and my personal favorite, Double Stuffed Oreos, can do. 

I may get a chocolate pie later and eat the entire thing, lol.

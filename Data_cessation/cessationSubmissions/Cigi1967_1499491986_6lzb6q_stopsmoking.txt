Day 💯

Woohoo 🎉 Day 💯. Not sure at Day 1 I ever thought I'd hit this milestone. And in reality, I almost missed it. Many things have happened in these days and I'm proud to say where in the past it would have been something that sent me running to the store for a carton of smokes, I've made it past those triggers. Ready for the next 100.

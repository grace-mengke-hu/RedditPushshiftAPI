1m and struggle just started

Hello there,

I have stopped smoking 1 month back. 35 days to be precise. I never smoked after my last cigarette. And during the first month, I didn't even feel anything. Although,10th day was bit rough, I was able to stay quit and motivated.

However, as soon as I touched my 30 day Mark, I am starting to feel that I think most often about having one cigarette (May be as a trophy for being quit for 1 month). 

Yesterday I asked my friend for a cigarette but thankfully he refused since he knows am quitting. 

I just want to stay quit. Any help would be appreciated. Did anyone feel the same?

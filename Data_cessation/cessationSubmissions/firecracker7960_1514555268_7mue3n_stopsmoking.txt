So close!!

I’m half way thru 10 days with out smoking, but that urge still hits me hard randomly. Been doing good at distracting myself for a few min then it goes away. Not doing the best at starting some new goals. But keeping up with the smoking and I severely cut back on my drinking. If only I could get more active as well, trying to start a few 30 day challenges at least. Well maybe I’ll just try the one first....hmmm I’m thinking squats?? Bigger butt would be a nice reward lol. Sadly it’s been so cold all my money goes towards heating oil so I haven’t been able to treat myself so to speak to doing so well with my goals so far, so hopefully this extra push helps make a difference!!! This year is dedicated to a better, healthier me!!!

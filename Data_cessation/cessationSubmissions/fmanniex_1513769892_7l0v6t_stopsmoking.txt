Using zyban to quit smoking, currently on day 3 but afraid to drink alcohol over the festive season.

Hi guys,
So I did it, I finally made the decision to quit smoking... and with the help of Zyban everything is going swimmingly. The only fear I have, is when I plan to go to a few partys/nights out over Christmas and New Year- I have no idea how well the drunk version of myself will resist smoking. Does anybody have any tips/advice in relation to this? Most of my friends smoke, but I'm lucky in that my boyfriend doesn't so I'm sure he'll be super supportive at the partys but I'm not too sure my willpower will be as great...

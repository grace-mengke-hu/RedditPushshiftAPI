Is it normal to experience dryness in the mouth soon after quitting?

It's been 1 day since I stopped and I'm starting to feel dryness in the mouth. I used to smoke for about 1.5 years, 4-5 cigarettes a day. Do any of you experience this? If so, any remedies, besides staying hydrated (I've been drinking lots of water)?

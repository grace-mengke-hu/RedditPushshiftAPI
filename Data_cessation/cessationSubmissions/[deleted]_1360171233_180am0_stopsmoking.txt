2 years. What a roller coaster it has been.

When I quit, I never thought I would ever make it this far. I came so close to breaking quite a few times. I still get cravings once every couple of months, I do not know if they will ever go away. For those of you who, like me, get intense cravings, let me tell you this: exercise is your best friend when quitting. You do not have to go to the gym or anything, you can go for a run and/or do some sit-ups and push-ups at home. Think of how great it feels to be free of cigarettes, that alone is now good enough for me to stay off the cancer sticks.

For all of you quitters young and old, keep at it. My mom always told me to never quit anything, but I am glad I quit the stoges. I am not going to quit being a quitter.

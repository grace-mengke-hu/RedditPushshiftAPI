Day 3 is really screwing with me.

First off, the first two days were a cake walk compared to today. My coping method is to look on the internet for the physiological reasons why but I can't find anything definitive. But then my attention span isn't operating at normal.

I am literally watching the clock and debating whether or not to make a store run before closing time. Then I come here and read several posts, then I check the rest of the internet, now I am back here again. It's maddening to me that something so destructive now feels like a basic need.

My better half came home and asked how I felt and I responded "I feel like I am thirsty as hell but I am not allowed to drink". That pretty much sums it up for me, I honestly have never felt this bad before. I quit once before and it was nothing like this. 

I am still reading, still listing all the reasons NOT to go to the store. Oh yea, did I mention I am now experiencing the depression portion of my withdrawal? Never expected that to happen.

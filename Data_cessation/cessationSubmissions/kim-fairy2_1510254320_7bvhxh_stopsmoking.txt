What helps with cravings?

I started a discussion on here before and I found it really interesting to read people's stories.

I also know that cravings can be tough so I thought I might make a post about it, and ask you guys what helps for you!

So.. Please let me know :)

Ps. I'm not talking about substitutes like patches etc. Just curious what you guys do/did when it gets tough.

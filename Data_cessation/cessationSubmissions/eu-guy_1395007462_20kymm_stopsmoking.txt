Some words of encouragement: It's been a year

I've been smoke free for 369 days now and I thought I should tell you guys, because it might make the whole thing seem less impossibru if more people post success stories. 

For me it's been about fighting the cravings one at a time. If you can win the first time, the next one you can win just as well. Voila, a year has passed.

I started doing fitness (alternating between gym and running outside) too. The running especially was/is essential to my 'healing' (both body and mind). Feels like I'm purging the shit out of my lungs when I run. Also, endorphins. I like it.

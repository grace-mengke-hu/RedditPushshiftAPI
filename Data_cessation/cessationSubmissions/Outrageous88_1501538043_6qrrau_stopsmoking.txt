Tomorrow is my big day - any tips?

Hello all, I found this sub a few days ago while searching the web for advice and tips about conquering my addiction. I made a plan that started two weeks ago, and set my quit day for Aug. 1st. There is a ton of stuff out on the web to help us all in this journey to better and healthier people. 

I decided to use the patch and the gum to help take the edge off while I focus on the psychological addiction the first few months. NRT is controversial but it is the method that I think will be best for me. 

The mental side of my addiction is what has hindered me in the past and I just wanted to post this to remind myself and others that we can do anything we set our mind to. 

My biggest concern is that I live with a smoker, we have agreed to keep my home office smoke free, however I can not help but think the temptation will be there even with the patch and gum. This is going to be a long journey- reprogramming my mind so my subconscious doesn't sneak up on me and talk my rational self into saying F it and going back to smoking. 

I found this article to be helpful and can hardly wait to try this in the near future- I thought maybe it would help some of you courageous cold turkey quitters out there.

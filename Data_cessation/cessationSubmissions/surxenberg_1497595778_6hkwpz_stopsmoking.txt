The biggest change (to me) as an ex-smoker

First off, a disclaimer:

I relapsed last summer after not having smoked for 5 full years. Before that, I had smoked for 7 years. We all know how stupid that is, so let's not discuss that. At least this allows me to clearly see things from both perspectives.

I just wanted to point out that, as a non smoker, it takes(took) me an hour to wake up in the morning. As a smoker, I could just smoke two cigarettes and have my body up and running. Nicotine is, after all, an extremely potent parasympathomimetic. Smoking allowed me to skip breakfast, lunch and even dinner.
Now that this has gone I need to readjust to this pharmacological reality. When I lose concentration, I need to take a 5 minutes walk and fresh air. I need to drink green tea. I need to eat breakfast. And I need to deal with low blood sugar and low blood pressure (I'm 6'6" and low blood pressure has always been an issue for me).

I'd rather have that than heart disease, emphysema, throat cancer, smelling clothes or the inability to go anywhere without carrying a lighter and cigarettes though.

Acknowledging these consequences to my body, mind and lifestyle and seeing them for what they are has tremendously helped me quit smoking before and does this time, too.

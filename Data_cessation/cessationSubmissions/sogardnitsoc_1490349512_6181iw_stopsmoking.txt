Quitters flu. What helped you and how much time it lasted?

I've quit smoking cold turkey 5 days ago. I was reading about the benefits of quitting right after your last smoke but I think that's bullshit.

I feel like shit. I don't feel the need to smoke again but my throat is killing me. It's like having sand paper in your throat. I can't sleep, my head is killing me, my nose is overworked.

I will never smoke again but quitting is much difficult than I thought

I'm so sick of this disappointment I carry for myself

I'm fucking done. I can't do this anymore. Going to bed every night after my "last" cigarette. Resetting my QuitNow App on my phone. Falling asleep thinking about how much I will get done when the new day comes...only to wake up and have a half hearted battle with myself over whether or not I'm going to light up the day's first cigarette. 

I'm tired of feeling tired all the time. Having to lay down and wanting to nap. I'm sick of getting out of breath with simple tasks. Fuck this! Fuck being weak and letting the chemical addiction win. 

It's the middle of the day. I smoked close to a half a pack already. I feel so beaten down and tired and ill. I had zero intention of quitting in my mind right now but it just hit me in the face like a Mac truck. So I am through, done, finished. There is so much more to this life and I am finally ready to live as a free man. Fuck going back. Fuck quitting quitting...it is time to finally live.

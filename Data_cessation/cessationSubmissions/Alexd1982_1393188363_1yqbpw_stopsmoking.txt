Day 6. Is keeping a box of cigarettes too much temptation?!?

Hi everyone, I'm new to this site! I'm currently on Day 6 of quitting using patches! When my quit day arrived I still had some cigarettes left which I've carried round with me since! I feel like they're a bit of a security blanket. But friends have said that by keeping them I'm preparing myself to fail! What does everyone think?

Light depression?

Dear all,
I have quit smoking more than 2 months ago, and not even chewing nicotine gum for like 2 weeks now.  I thought its pretty much useless, even if it stopped my craving completely. However also for a week or two now, i feel really depressed. I dont really have cravings, the Allen Carr book helped me a lot mentally. My work is quite stressful sometimes but I can talk to my girlfriend about it and its better after. But still some days I just feel completely lost, i feel miserable and I just want to quit my job and stuff like that. And on those days I feel it would be amazing to light up one. Anyone experienced the same?

500 hours.

I'm having a strange relationship with my cravings and urges now.  While I still do get them, I really don't have a desire to fulfill them.  I think that's a good sign.  I was buying gas today, and it triggered a craving, I even went into the store and bought myself a drink and a snack, and wasn't really tempted to buy smokes.

Day 1 complete - My motivation

My motivation may seem silly to others but I want to be able to take much fatter dabs (concentrated thc oils) with out heaving, losing my breath and coughing extremely bad. 

I've been smoking cigarettes now since 18 years old, and I turned 27 on may 19th...this is offically the first 24 hours...and I've been just chewing nicotine gum.

No one said the nicotine gum turned my throat into lava though - but I have found a technique chewing it. Chew it 15-30 times, then store it in between your jaw like chewing tobacco. Works like a charm. 

Here's to another 24 hours.

Advice / Tips on quitting vaping?

I used to smoke cigarettes regularly for a handful of years, and decided to switch to vaping(a few years ago). I felt healthier vaping, but after a year or two, I started to realize my dependency on it and how much my cravings meddled into my personal and social life. 

I quit smoking all together (cold turkey) for 4 months after reading Allen Carr's The Easy Way to Stop Smoking. It worked great, but at my 4 months mark I decided it wouldn't hurt to have 1 smoke with my soon-to-be sister in law (in order to bond with her over a bottle of wine and ex-boyfriend tears). It was all down hill from there.

I'm back to only vaping, but after a few months of it, I find myself constantly and obsessively thinking about how it's hurting my lungs and how frustratingly hard it is for me to remember how shitty and guilty I feel the moment after vaping when I'm having a craving. The thoughts are the worst because I obsessively over think about the potential damage I am doing to my lungs, and then I get stressed out and crave nicotine again.

Does anyone have any advice on how you stopped vaping (or smoking). I thought cutting down the nicotine level to almost 0 might help, but now I'm just vaping more at a time and feeling even more fatigued of oxygen. 

I'm open to any suggestions. Mind tricks, substitutes, thought processes, ANYTHING.

Thank you in advance with all of my heart!

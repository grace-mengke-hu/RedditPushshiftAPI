Time flies

can't believe it's been 838 days. I haven't really kept track. First week was hard and it's been smooth sailing since. I sometimes get a craving if I have coffee but the smell drives me insane! 

I am one of the worst people in the planet at quitting addicting habits. If I can do it, anyone can.

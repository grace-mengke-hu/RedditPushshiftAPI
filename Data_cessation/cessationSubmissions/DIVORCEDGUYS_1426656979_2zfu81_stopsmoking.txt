Sleep Problems?

29 y/o male, just quit a week ago. I had a bad chest cold and took advantage of the downtime to get the first few days out of the way. At noon tomorrow, it will be a full week. I'm doing alright, but tonight I'm having trouble sleeping. Has anyone else faced this? 

I'm going to make it stick this time. One day at a time, one breath at a time. Thanks for any advice!

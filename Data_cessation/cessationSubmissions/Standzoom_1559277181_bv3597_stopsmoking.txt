Anyone else notice this after stopping smoking?

Just to find out if I'm hopefully not the only one, is this normal? I keep having weird random pains here and there, like a sharp stabbing pain in my foot, for no reason, and later a weird muscle cramp in my leg or arm, or a pulled muscle cramp like in my stomach, or a pain on my elbow. No injury, no specific reason, and they don't last very long. I dont remember having anything like this while I was still smoking. And it is also happening occasionally that I have a cough with phlegm- is that just my lungs trying to clean out after 17 years of smoking? And still every now and then a wheeze.  I hope this weird stuff stops soon. Thanks for feedback.

Drinking and smoking

Im 18 years old and smoked for almost 4 years. I'm on my second attempt at quitting. Im pretty tipsy right now and I'm glad im not old enough to buy cigarettes, or else I would of bought some already for sure. I turn 19 in a couple months and im nervous because I will be old enough. I feel like the only thing stopping me sometimes is my anxiety of talking to people I dont know and asking them to buy me cigs.

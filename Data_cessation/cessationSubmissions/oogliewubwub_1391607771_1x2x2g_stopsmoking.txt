Day 35, battling horrible cravings the past few days

I'm not going to give in to the cravings (at least not right now..being snowed in and all) but wow.  I thought the intense ones were long gone but I guess not.  
Who else dealt with this and what did you do? Just white knuckle it and hope for the best?

Side effects

I have been smoke free for 16 days now. 
This time for good I hope!
Every time I quit, after a few weeks, I get this annoying feeling that I can clear my throat but when I try to cough anything up to clear my throat, it's dry and there is nothing to bring up. 
At points I almost feel like I'm choking on a horribly thick mucous. 
Does this ever go away? How long did it last for you?

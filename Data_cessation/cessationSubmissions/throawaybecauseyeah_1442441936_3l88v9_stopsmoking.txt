Stopped a week ago. Getting the shakes?

Hey so I stopped smoking (cold turkey) a little over a week ago, because I had a week off from work. Started work again two days ago and I notice my hands shaking a lot. This is not optimal because I work in a high stress environment where detailed work is important. Has anybody experienced this when quitting? If so any tips?

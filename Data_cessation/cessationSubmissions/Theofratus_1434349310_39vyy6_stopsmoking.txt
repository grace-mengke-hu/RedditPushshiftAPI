I need to stop smoking now!

It's only been a year since I started doing it. At first, I thought it was cool and not really that harmful because I didn't feel any potential damage in my body. Ever since a month ago, my throat is starting to swell and it amasses large amount of nasty mucus that I must spit away every morning with a shitty taste. I know it's the cigarettes that does that to me. I have smoked weed before and it's what got me started to smoke cigarettes too. I love the green, don't mind me but it has increased the chances of me ever trying. So I plan to stop but I have no way to keep my promise because I live in France and here, most of my friends smoke though I feel like I don't need cigarettes anymore but it's still going to be hard. Stay away for harmful substances for a while.

Aftrer 12 years... I have no desire for another cigarette. In fact, I can't even imagine buying a pack.

I use nicotine gum, and while many people in this sub are against that, it has saved me. I no longer want a cigarette at all. Even after a drink! It grosses me out when I smell smoke. I live in an apartment and would have to go outside of the building to smoke. That means getting dressed and putting on layers of clothing to step out into the freezing air to inhale gross smoke.

I feel better in general. Not a big difference, but I feel it. The main thing I notice is how preoccupied I used to be. Everything was a trigger. God forbid I watched Mad Men or any show where the characters smoked. I'd have to pause the show and step out.

Anyway... good luck to those in the difficult stages. I attempted to quit several times, but it feels like a switch was flipped. And I am from a family of smokers. I am finally free! You will be too!!

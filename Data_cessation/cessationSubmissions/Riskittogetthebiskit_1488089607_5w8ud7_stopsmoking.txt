2 weeks!

I don't even believe it myself. I'm a SMOKER smoker. Any time I could get a break (be it 30 seconds, 2 minutes, 30 minutes) I would be smoking/chain smoking the entire time. I love cigarettes. I've been trying since the new year to quit and it really took a few times before I could get any traction. Thanks to you guys for your help, I've been visiting here every day. I'm also 2.5 years sober so to let go of the smoking was sort of sad to me, but I realize now that it's not as scary as I thought it would be to try living life without it.

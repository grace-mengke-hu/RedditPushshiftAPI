My client lost his tongue

Ever since the first of this year, I’ve been trying to quit smoking. Some times I make it a few days, sometimes several weeks. I quit again 4 days ago (and it’s the first time I’ve felt really confident that I won’t go back.) As if sent by the quit-smoking gods, one of my clients called me last week. I hadn’t heard from him in about 9 months. Apparently, he had been in the hospital battling stage 4 cancer of the tongue due to a life of smoking. We all know smoking is bad for us, but it’s one thing to consider “it will give you cancer,” in kind of a cold, clinical way. But when he came in today, it really hit me what the reality of getting cancer from smoking looks like. 
He had to have a 14 hour surgery wherein they took skin from his arm (huge, ugly scars run up his forearm now) to patch up his neck, where they removed 14 lymph nodes, as well as part of his tongue. He hasn’t eaten solid food in 5 months, because he can’t swallow, and has to feed himself through a tube that protrudes from his stomach. He weighs 110 lbs (and he’s a middle aged man, probably around 5’9.) If I didn’t already know him, I’d think he was mentally challenged because of the way he talks now. Since he’s missing part of his tongue, and can’t swallow, he speaks very slowly, and very slurred, through a mouth gushing with saliva.
He told me that he’s been passed around different nursing homes over the last few months, and that he was one of the “lucky ones” because he got an 8 hour pass every day to go outside, where a lot of other patients in his condition, or similar, were kept in the hospital, 24/7, for months, basically like prisoners, until they could fully recover.
Obviously, he stopped smoking after the surgery, which was in January. It just made me appreciate that we have the option to quit now, while we’re all relatively healthy, instead of being forced to quit later down the road, and in such a dilapidated state.

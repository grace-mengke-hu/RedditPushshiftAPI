I keep my eyes open for experiences that feel different as a nonsmoker. Most things are the same or mildly different. Some things are way, way different, like concerts. I found a new one: the beach. The beach is much nicer as a nonsmoker. Like, much nicer. Presenting #123 Scyther. See you tomorrow.

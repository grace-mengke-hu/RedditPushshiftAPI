65 days....

And I smoked with a friend.....I now feel like crap and have a cough that I thought I had gotten over a few days ago. I guess that's my punishment. 

I am not starting the clock over I think I am doing pretty damn good considering I smoked for 16 years.
Glad it made me feel like this so now I know how much I really don't like it anymore!

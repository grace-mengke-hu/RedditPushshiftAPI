Five months today

I truly never thought I'd get this far but my willpower got stronger as my cravings got weaker and I genuinely have no interest in cigarettes anymore. I am able to go out drinking with friends without being tempted and even began to dislike the smell of them. 


What worked for me was initially the Alan Carr book and the ritual of having my last ever cigarette and switching to vaping. Starting off with a comparable nicotine level to what I was used to (around 18mg) and gradually reducing my nicotine intake (currently on 2-3 mg) , next steps will be 0mg and then stopping that eventually. 


I feel much healthier and energetic after the initial horrible feelings of quitting and to anyone just starting on this journey, whatever method you plan on using to quit, stick it out I promise you it gets easier!

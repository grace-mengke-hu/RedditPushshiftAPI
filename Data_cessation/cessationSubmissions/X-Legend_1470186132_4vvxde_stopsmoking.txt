Question about Chantix

Hi all, I've been on Chantix for about 3 weeks, and I've experienced practically none of the side effects. I've not been depressed, I've not been nauseous, my dreams haven't been that vivid (although I've actually noticed an increase in some...ahem...naughtier dreams :) The problem is that while I've noticed a slight decrease in my cravings, I still have a pretty strong pull to smoke. Is there a point where the cravings get more manageable, or by this point in my dosage will the cravings more or less stay the same? I'm not trying to be impatient with my prescription, I have a lot more to go I know, but anecdotally from friends I've heard that by week 2 they felt almost no pull to smoke and I don't think they were any less heavy a smoker than I am. Is there anything else I can look forward to as I continue with the prescription? Thanks!

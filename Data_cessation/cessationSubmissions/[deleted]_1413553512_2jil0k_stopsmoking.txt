My SO is on the verge of leaving me and I don't know what to do.

We haven't been connecting. I've been so anxious and stressed and snapping at him. We got in to a big fight this morning. He said that I'm arguing everything he says and that he would have more fun hanging out with a stranger. I tried to explain that I've been like this because I quit smoking.. he said 1. That's not his problem. He tries to be supportive but I don't get to treat him like my punching bag and 2. He thinks that this is all about a bigger issue and that I've clearly lost interest.


How do I fix this? How do I manage these ridiculous emotions and all of the anxiety I've been living? He's the love of my life and I can't lose him.

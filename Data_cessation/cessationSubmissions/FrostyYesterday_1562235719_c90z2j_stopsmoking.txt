Is The Damage Done To My Vocal Chords Irreversible?

I've been smoking for over a decade since I was going through puberty. And I must have smoked heavily because everyone else in my family is a tenor but I'm a deepass bass - I can hit a C1 (lowest note on a piano!). I've also always wanted to sing at a certain level but didn't have money for lessons until now. But I have noticed that I've basically become tone deaf during the past years. I know which notes I want to hit, but it comes out incorrectly. Furthermore, I cannot shout without my voice vibrating as if I were in a choir!

With the proper training, will this be irreversible?

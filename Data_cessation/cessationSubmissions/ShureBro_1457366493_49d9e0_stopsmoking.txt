When does the apathy get better?

Hi guys. I haven't ever had a smoking habit, but I have used the Scandinavian version of smokeless tobacco, called ["Snus".](https://www.buysnus.com/snusbrand/Odens_Extreme_Cold_Dry_White_-_Metal_Can.aspx) 

It is more addictive nicotine-wise than cigarettes, and for 8 years I used one can a day, which equals to 24 piches with about 12-15mg nicotine in each pouch.

Now, on to the issue. I stopped 6 days ago, and since then, I struggle to really take joy in anything. Watching TV, playing video games, making music..basically everything that I used to love is now not enjoyable because I cannot use nicotine. The only things I've enjoyed for the past week is sex and working out. 

I reckon this is due to the dopamine receptors being completely FUBAR due to the nicotine abuse for so many years. Have any of you had similar problems, and when does it get better? 


**TL;DR: Since stopping snus 6 days ago I struggle to take joy in activities I used to enjoy a great deal. Life is less fun now. When does it end?**

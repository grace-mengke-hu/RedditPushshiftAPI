What lies ahead

So, I've just finished the easy way to stop smoking book. I'm excited to stop but wondered if anyone already suffering from anxiety managed to stop and keep the anxiety in check. 
I totally understand the book and the fear but anxiety is not mentioned and I don't know if I need to prepare myself for more panicked feelings or of being overwhelmed. 
Thank you

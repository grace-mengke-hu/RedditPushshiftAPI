Yesterday, I threw the box away.

Since last few days, every cigarette I was smoking, it was filled with guilt. 
I am jobless, feeling lonely and depressed these days. 

I am always concerned how smoking is also impacting my physical appearance as well. It makes lips black, makes face look dull...

I was binge-watching a series and was smoking a cigarette (that's all pretty much I have been doing for last few days). Suddenly I felt a shame- it was the strongest sense of shame and guilt, I was on verge of melting down.

I knocked off the cigarette, broke all cigarettes in the pack, and threw that in the trash.

It's been around 17 hours, I am feeling lethargic (which I have been feeling since last few days) and irritated. I feel the craving, but I am not missing it.

Edit: Day three, since the smoke free.

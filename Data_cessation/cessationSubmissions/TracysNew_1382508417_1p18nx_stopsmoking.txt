Another 'one week in' post

It's getting legitimately tough. I've been craving pretty hardcore for the last day or two.

The good news is, I'm visiting my folks and they live in suburban hell. Hard/impossible justify going out to grab a pack.

The bad news is, I have a very good friend in this city and I'm dying to see her, but I'm fairly certain she still smokes and not bumming one off of her will take a LOT of resolve, especially if we're drinking, especially especially with her sense of southern hospitality.

On the flip side, an imgur photoset of a photographer's cancer-ridden wife hit my front page today. Sobering shit.

I'd write more, but it'd devolve into a depressing Russian novel of the plaguing conflicts inherent in the human condition.

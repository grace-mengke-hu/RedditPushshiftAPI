Withdrawals way worse on second try?

I tried quitting smoking a year ago. I got over a month extremely easily, and even when I started again, it wasn't because I was craving it. It was a bar night in the summer and I figured smoking for just one night wouldn't do anything anymore since I had had no nicotine withdrawal feelings from the start.

Needless to say, fell off the wagon there. It seems that because quitting felt so easy that time around, starting again was also too easy. I've been kicking myself a lot for being such a dumbass. The start of the cessation was so easy, and I threw that gift away because I was a retard for one night. Most smokers would pay a buttload of money to get as easy start as I had, and I went and wasted it on a whim.

Now I've recently been trying to quit again, and I've been struggling horribly with day 2-3. Been doing "pauses" when I get one or two days pretty effortlessly, but then it hits me. The withdrawal. And I feel ill-equipped to deal with it. In come the excuses, I'll try again soon, the timing wasn't right and so forth, bla bla bla.

I keep asking myself, what changed? A year's difference in smoking shouldn't make such a big difference for addiction, should it? Is it all in my head? What the hell is wrong with me this time? Why is it harder now?

I've always been a pretty smart guy. Stopping smoking is the smart thing to do. And the first time in my life, I'm failing at doing the smart thing.

Gritting my Teeth

Today has been really tough and I'm not sure why. I've just got that little voice poking me, trying to get me to cross the street and buy a pack.

I quit smoking because it was killing me, costing me a fortune, and ruining my social life. There is no such thing as one cigarette, or one pack. If I choose not to smoke, this feeling will go away. If I choose to smoke, I will sink back into addiction.

Starting to quit for the first time.

Well I quit smoking on saturday my last cigarette was friday at about 2pm. I started for dumb reasons but I have quit for good ones. I want to get in shape for  next summer. My first step was quitting smoking now so I have the lung capacity to run and exercise again.

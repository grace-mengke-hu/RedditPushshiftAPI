My last one was on Saturday night

I didn't even realize it was my last one at the time, I probably barely even enjoyed it anyways.

It was a week of vacation at the beach with a wedding the week before. Lots of drinking and thus lots of smoking from two Fridays ago until this last Saturday.  I came home and got strep throat and had a 102 fever and so I've had a good reason not to smoke other than the actual good reason of smoking is bad for me.  I plan on continuing the no smoking from here on out. I am sick of how crappy it makes me feel all the time, even when I am enjoying one I know in the back of my head that I really don't like it anymore.  I've been so dishonest with myself about my smoking for so long and I am terrified of getting sick, so I've decided that it is time to take my health back and quit smoking for good. I've got three packs in my car that are going into the trash when I get home and I'll be using a quitting app to track progress as well.   I know my Fiancee will be happy because she's been trying to get me to quit for 5 years and has told me she wouldn't marry me if I were still smoking. I've got 90 days until I get married, now is the time and the time is now.  

Thank you /r/stopsmoking for providing this outlet of support and a place to get this off of my chest.

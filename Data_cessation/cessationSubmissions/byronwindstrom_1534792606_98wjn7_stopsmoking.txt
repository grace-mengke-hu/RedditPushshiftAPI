My Grandfather is dying of Lung Cancer, a Tragic Warning! He quit 40 years ago.

My Grandfather, whom I call Morfar (Swedish for mother’s father) is 89 years old, he was just diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer with effusion. He is going to die. What’s really sad is that he quit smoking almost 40 years ago, just before his 50th birthday. 40 years of healthy eating, living and exercise was not enough to stop this insidious cancer from reading its ugly head as many years later. When my family found out we went to visit him and he is in very rough shape, he is 6’4 and only weighs 135 lbs, he is a skeleton. After we took him to see his oncologist we found out that he has only 3-6 months to live if he does immunotherapy as he is too old for chemo, the other option is hospice. There is a silver lining which is that this was the final kick in the ass I needed to quit smoking. I have 10 days cigarette and tobacco free. I will never be a smoker again after seeing the devastation of lung cancer first hand. I can’t promise that I won’t ever slip up but if I do I will get right back on my feet! I’m a 26 year old male 6’2 180 lbs and I will not suffer the same fate as my Morfar.

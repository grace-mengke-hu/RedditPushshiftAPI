Important decision

I finally took the decision to stop smoking for good, I've been smoking for 4.5 years now and my life has been going down since then ( of course this is not the only reason) but I think it's a good start for a change.I want to save my health and money, but above this I want to prove myself that i am a strong person. I lied myself too many times, i always said i am not dependent and I can stop anytime, but now it's time to prove. I would like to hear any tips/tricks, i saw a lot of you guys have apps, which is the best one? Do they cost/are they worth it? I would be greatful for any kind of advice. Have a nice day !

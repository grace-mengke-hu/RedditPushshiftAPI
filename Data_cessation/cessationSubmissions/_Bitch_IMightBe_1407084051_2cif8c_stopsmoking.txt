Alright. You guys convinced me.

Thank you. Today I got the patch (starting off with 21mg as I smoke(d) a pack a day).

However, I do have a question. My mother said she quit succesfully by taking the patch, and going to the doctor and requesting chantix. I feel weird about the idea of taking a pill and using a patch at the same time. What are some of ya'lls thoughts about that? Also, I've heard people tend to gain a good amount of weight when they quit... is this true and if so, how much did you guys gain?

ah! this patch is so itchy!! X( 

But, I'm excited! This is the first time I've tried to quit! I've been smoking menthols very heavily for about 7 years. It's about damn time.

edit: after first hour- okay, the patch isn't itchy anymore, but now my left arm feels heavy and sore. meehh

Edit 2: ugh, i feel nauseous. I have a strong urge to say fuck it. I guess I'm just going to try and nap through it. This sucks.

Edit 3: this is turning into my little diary, but whatever it helps for some reason to talk about it. 
I just watched that one Alex Carr video, and my perception of withdrawal has changed. Now I feel bad for using the patch, but I've already spent 52 bucks on it. Might as well see it through. The end of day 1 is coming closer, and when it does it will officially be the longest I've gone without a cigarette! Whooop!

Edit 4: I can't sleep. :/ I tried playing a little guitar, doing some sit ups, spending some time on Reddit.. I never experience insomnia... 

I think I'm really nervous about experiencing triggers tomorrow. I wish my mind would calm down.

Edit 5: I'm gonna punch a baby. 

Edit 4: okay. I didn't sleep well last night till I took off that patch. I think I'm just gonna go cold turkey.

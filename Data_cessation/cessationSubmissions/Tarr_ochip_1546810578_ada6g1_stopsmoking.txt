Day 3 of a serial quitter

Not my first quitting attempt so I’m not surprised by the immediate effects of stopping smoking... my breathing feels easier, I don’t stink of smoke, I don’t feel self-conscious of smelly breath, and the pride for going cold turkey... 

This time though, I’m older (31F)... I’m struggling a little with the influx of fearful thoughts, mostly being that I’m going to pick up weight and that’ll be worse than being a smoker. It’s almost obsessive. 

I’m realistic about it though and I know there’ll be a little transition while my body gets rid of the toxins. And I know I might be emotionally eating for a little while but I’m trying to find healthy things to fill the “void” with.

Here’s my stuff to avoid for now list:
-coffee
-alcohol
-socialising with other smokers

Here’s my stuff to increase:
-lots of sweaty workouts
-green tea &amp; water
-veggies to nibble on when I crave

Things to celebrate EVERYDAY!
-every moment I craved and breathed through it
-ooh, I smell pretty still
-skin &amp; hair looks brighter and shinier
-ciggy money gets reinvested in savings

Things I miss about smoking:
-my smoko friends
-finishing a task with a celebratory ciggy

I hope anyone reading this can relate... I’d love to hear your thoughts!

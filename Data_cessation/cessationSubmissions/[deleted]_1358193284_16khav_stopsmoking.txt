Well, I'm giving it the ole college try!

Hey, r/stopsmoking, I'm sick of smoking and am going to ~~try to~~ quit. I picked up a pack of that Zonnic stuff and using a piece now (it's pretty nifty, I suppose). I imagine it's gonna be a little difficult, being as I life in a smoker's home at the moment. In a couple of days, however, the fiancee and I are going to be moving to my mother's apartment while she's away for a while and we decided that it's a good opportunity for us to stop. 

Wish my luck, my friends!

2 moths after last cigarette, sometimes I still get the ,,damn, a cigarette would be cool". Will it last forever?

Firstly, I don't want to scare of those who are considering to quit. I don't feel extreme cravings like I did during the first week and truly I can live without cigarettes easily. It's just that sometimes I remember the vibe of smoking and how it associates with the best memories I have (like the first time going to music festival, parties and having a beer with friends). Also recently the weather got really nice after a long winter and it just hit me, because for some reason I also associate smoking with the seasons. 

These type of light cravings only last for a few minnutes and really Im not planning to start smoking again, god no. Usually when I get them I think about the "timeline of quitting smoking" and also all of the benefits of not smoking. 

So really, I just wanted to ask those who are quite long into quitting, are these light psychological cravings a part of my life now or will they completely go away someday? 

And most importantly, sorry for my bad english

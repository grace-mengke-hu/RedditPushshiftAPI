Tight chest, tense neck, feel like I'm on the verge of choking someone

I'm a 21 year old girl that has been smoking since 13. So I've spent 1/3 of my life smoking. I have quit a couple of times for ~3 months, but always fall back into when I'm on vacation or something where I feel I can "treat" myself.

I'm determined to never smoke again, and I quit cold turkey 11 days ago. I haven't really had any issues with cravings, but my body feels so tense like I'm on the verge of choking someone or having a massive panic attack. I feel like I can't breath and like I'm trapped in my own body.

I've tried meditating, running, listening to ASMR, but those things only make it go away for a little while. I've started letting myself eat whatever I want, whenever I want, but I'm scared of getting fat.

What are some tips to help myself get through these stressful feelings?

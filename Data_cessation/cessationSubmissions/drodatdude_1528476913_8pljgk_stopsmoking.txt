Can't believe I finally quit

 Being a heavy smoker for the last 10\-11 years, I've been trying to quit for the last year or so. Patches, gum and all of that just didn't work for me. Vaping appeared to be the only solution, but it isn't really my thing too. It feels more like smoking hookah than cigs. It also didn't satisfy my cravings at all. I've tried a couple vaping setups and was using it occasionally until my brother introduced me to STLTH Vape.  


I liked it from the first puff. It feels good in the hand. It draws nicely. It gives me a great throat kick I was looking for, and the most important thing \- it’s easy to use.  


Yes I know, it is so\-called "nonrefillable closed system device" that many vapers dislike. I am a lazy person, so I don’t mind spending the extra dollars for the pods and btw it's much more affordable compared with traditional cigs or similar devices like Juul for instance. Anyways, I didn’t like to deal with the hustle of building and mixing and filling up the more complex vaping systems I tried before, that's just not my thing. All I wanted is a decent cig alternative.  


I've been using STLTH for the last 4\-5 weeks now and it entirely replaced my smoking habit by week 3. Never been happier! I don't think i will go back to cigs, they started to disgust me..

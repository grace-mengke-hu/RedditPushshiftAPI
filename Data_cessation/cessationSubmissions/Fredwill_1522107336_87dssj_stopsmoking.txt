2 months! Yes this feels great

For those out there just starting out I can assure you that it gets easier as the days turn into weeks and suddenly you realize that smoking just doesn't make sense.  I'm feeling so confident this time and the reason is that I reflected deeply about what smoking was doing to me and realized how much better I could be if I didn't have to constantly in a never ending   way keep inhaling toxic smoke that gives you nothing.  The greatest benefit for me has been being able to feel good about myself  in the sense that I care about my body my mind my health.

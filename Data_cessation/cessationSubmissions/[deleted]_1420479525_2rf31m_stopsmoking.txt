Question about withdrawals and drinking

Hi all, I'm into day 5 so far and I think I'm over the worst of the withdrawal symptoms (had a particularly hellish day on day 3 where I had a few breakthroughs).

My plan from the outset was never to quit entirely, it was to cut down and only smoke when I drink. What I wanted to ask you smokers and ex smokers alike was, say I go a few weeks completely smoke free until the next time I drink, and then I smoke a few on a night out and whatnot, will the withdrawals effects be as intense as when I first quit (after a solid 2 years of smoking)? Can't find much info around the web.

I also wanted to add a bit of encouragement to those of you who are, like me, smoke free for the new year... you can do it! When you realise that every impulse, rationalisation or justification in your head to smoke is your body trying to control you, suddenly it becomes a lot easier to decide that 'you' (as in, the conscious 'you') should be in control, not at the whim of what your body needs.

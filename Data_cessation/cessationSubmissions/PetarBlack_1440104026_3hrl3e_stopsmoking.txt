Bought a pack after 12 days.

I've read "Easy Way To Stop Smoking" and the ideas really did sink in. I realize that you get nothing from smoking, that you smoke to feel like a non-smoker, when you have a cigarette it just relieves the negative effects smoking itself causes, so when you do light up it feels good just because it gets rid of a bad feeling you wouldn't even have if you don't smoke at all. 

When I'm at home I don't even think about cigarettes, I don't notice any serious withdraw pangs and I know that the slight fuzziness that might not even be from quiting will go away in a few weeks.

 But then I go out with a bunch a friends and everybody is smoking. Consciously I don't envy them that they have this filthy stick of poison up their mouth, I don't what to smoke. And then there is still this craving. Even though I don't want to smoke my mind is racing to find an excuse, to justify lighting one up. I guess tonight it was that I found it so easy to stop, I can get a pack and just enjoy a few on occasion. I know, this is the stupidest excuse,  there is nothing to enjoy, what I did will just make the next few days of not smoking harder.

 I smoked 2 and when I got home lit another one but didn't even finish it. I don't know what I'll do with the rest, I know the best thing to do is throw them away or give them to someone but I don't want to do it even though I don't plan on smoking anymore. 

This is the fucked up thing about nicotine - it messes with your head, makes you do things you don't actually want to do, it makes you lie to yourself to justify feeding that little addiction monster in you head. I don't know what the point of this post is, guess I just wanted to rant and write me thoughts out. Anyways, best of luck to everyone who is stopping and I highly recommend "Easy Way" even though I'm probably not the best example for it.

Haven't smoked since last night. Two packs a day. First day quit. Slow romanticism comes and goes.

Ik a long time lurker and ocasionaly poster. I'm 33m. Smoked for 16 years heavily. And I want to stop.  I have some nicotine tablets that I haven't opened. I'm on the fence about that. Advice? Seems like vaping or duping is still nicotine.

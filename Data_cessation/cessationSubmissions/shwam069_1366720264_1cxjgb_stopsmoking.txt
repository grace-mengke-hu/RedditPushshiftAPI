1 day and 9 hours since my last cigarette

Just randomly decided to quit smoking this past weekend. Bought the patch and slapped it on sunday night. Yes i was well aware of the vivid dreams. Nothing worse than a craving though. What i need help with is figuring out how to deal with my routines on the weekends. I LOVE relaxing at home with a cup of coffee and just go out to my balcony and enjoy the morning. Its almost like i dont care how "bored" i am at home, at least i have cigs.

Had the habit for 16 years. Today is day 3. I'm sad, grumpy, exited and motivated.

This is the 1st time that I really try to quit.


Previous attempts (many years ago) involved patches, e-cigs and gum, but then I ran out or I get drunk or any excuse was good enough to have just 1... 


I don't know if it's possible to feel sadness and excitement at the same time but here's my reasoning: 

I'm sad I'll never smoke another one ever. Cigarettes were my companions everywhere I went, everything was a good excuse to have one: To celebrate, to calm down, to wait for something, after lunch, drinking coffee, to go poop, etc... Also my empty pocket feels weird. 

I'm grumpy. Withdrawal makes you grumpy. Today a coworker was laughing and I've always thought his laughter sounds fake. Listening to him today was starting to make me angry... but he's the nicest guy! It's not his fault. Anyway I sent a message to my coworkers (in a nutshell): I quit smoking, gonna be grumpy for a little while, I apologize in advance. Of course everyone's really cool about it.

I'm exited for the future. I just have to wait a little to stop feeling sad or grumpy. My chest is already feeling a little better. I don't smell like woman repellent anymore. I'll run more. I'll gain weight (which is a good thing for me). [I wan't to feel like these veteran quitters](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/4x5vmp/wow_it_really_does_get_easier_just_logged_in_to/), read the comments from /u/mitchellb1980 and /u/DatGuy-x- . Thank you mitchell, DatGuy and everyone in /r/stopsmoking, you definitely make it easier. 

I am definitely motivated, but like I read in /r/getMotivated a long time ago: motivation is good but it fades away, however long motivation lasts use it to generate discipline, which lasts as long as you can make it last.

And a little song I want to dedicate to cigarettes and that old habit:

Stay strong and healthy everyone =)

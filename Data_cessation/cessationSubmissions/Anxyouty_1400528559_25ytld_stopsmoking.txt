Non-smoker here [26 M]. I need the thoughts/support of smokers. My BF [28 M] smokes and it is driving me mad.

I hope this is not an inappropriate post. I didn't see any rules in the sidebar saying that it would be.

Bottom line: my BF smokes and it is driving me mad. We've been dating just over a year. When we met he smoked, and was actively trying to quit with patches. I've always said I would never date a smoker. I let him slide because I guess I honestly thought he would quit. And now... a year later... he is still smoking. I try so hard to be supportive but I honestly think I am just making it worse. I think I talk about it too much. When he tries to quit and is doing well but then has a single cigarette, my heart drops. I know I shouldn't personalize it so much, but it's really difficult for me.

Blah, it's probably even more difficult for him.

It's gotten to the point where our relationship is very fragile. We are in therapy and everything and I really love him, but sometimes I feel like moving on would be best for both of us.

Any advice on how I can ACTUALLY be supportive? He says that he wants to quit, but that he also loves smoking. He has said that he thinks social smoking is OK. But then he has said that he probably just needs to realize on his own that he can't social smoke.

Thanks for letting me rant.

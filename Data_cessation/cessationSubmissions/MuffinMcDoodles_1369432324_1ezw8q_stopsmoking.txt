Quit cold turkey 5 days ago

Surprisingly, it hasn't been so bad, I have cravings but the desire to not smoke is stronger than the desire to have one. I have been getting slight headaches though. My question is..is it going to get easier as time goes on or harder? I've smoked for about 7 years and My coworker tells me that next week will be worse, I was wondering if that is typical.

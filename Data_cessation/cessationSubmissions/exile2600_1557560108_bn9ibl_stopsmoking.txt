Relapse :(

Nearly 3 days off cigarettes and I relapsed because of some tough feelings I'm trying to process. My relationship and living situation are causing me a lot of stress. Having moved to a rural area away from the town my friends live in has not been easy. I know it's a bump in the road to my goal. I'm embarrassed. After a crying jag on the floor in the middle of the night I just needed a drive and some cigarettes. I already feel like a failure in life and a relapse isn't exactly changing my perspective on my worth.

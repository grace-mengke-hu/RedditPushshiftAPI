Just bought Gum and Patches.

So I posted a few days ago about quitting because a co-worker jacked my cigarettes.  I didn't quit cold turkey, but I did spend the last few days thinking pretty hard about the choices I've been making.  Then about an hour ago I decided to go get gum and patches.  They will help me through the work day to establish a routine that doesn't involve taking a smoke break. This stops now.

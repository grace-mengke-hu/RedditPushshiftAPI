Just finished reading EASYWAY....

I am currently day 4 of being a non-smoker and just finished Allen Carr's book. It was AMAZING. Great approach, great advice, great everything! I reddit in 2 sittings, just couldn't put it down. Thanks everyone who recommended it to me. Hope everyone is is doing and feeling as great as I am :)

Quit smoking two weeks ago

I stopped smoking about 12 and a half days ago, I have an app that is keeping track of how much time it’s been, how much money I’ve saved and how many cigarettes I haven’t smoked. The first few days were really difficult and I had a lot of cravings. Since then, I’ll get one or two cravings a day, just light cravings. Then every three or four days I’ll have one absolutely huge craving where it’s almost like I have this thought well is it even worth it anymore. I was curious if anyone had any tips on how to continue to get passed those huge strong cravings? What are some things people do when those come around, do take your mind of them?

4days 15hours since my last cigarette

42 years old, started smoking when I was 7, so that's 35 years in.

20 a day minimum, I considered myself a lifelong smoker.

I've quit a couple of times before, always gone back.

I've booked a via ferrata trip in the dolomites later on in the year, and i don't want to be at the back of the trip again.

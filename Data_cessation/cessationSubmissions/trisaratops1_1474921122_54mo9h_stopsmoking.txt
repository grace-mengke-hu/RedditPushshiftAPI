How to help your partner quit

My partner of almost 5 years, J, has been smoke-free for a month after 9 years of smoking a pack a day or more! I wanted to share some tips for what worked for him and how I was able to help.

First off, if you're a non-smoker dating or married to a smoker, you probably realized quickly that it is your partner's decision and there is nothing you can do to MAKE your partner quit. If he wasn't going to quit for himself or his family, why would he quit for me? You should also understand that addiction is a disease. Most smokers buy one pack at a time even though a carton is a better value because they always think they might quit after that one pack. Smokers know all the health problems and how expensive it is but they do it anyway because their brain tells them to. The only way someone will quit is if he or she makes the decision to do so. Your partner has to WANT to do it.

I've always struggled with encouragement vs. pressure. If J felt like I was pressuring him, it made him want to smoke. We are facing a cross-country move and I basically told him I didn't want this to continue if we were to move together. It wasn't an ultimatum per se but a serious conversation about our relationship's future. I think he understood, especially after he quit, that it was out of caring for him--it hurts to see your partner do this to himself and know that you might lose the person you love earlier than you should have.

It can take a few tries to quit. If your partner slips up, don't lash out. Encourage your partner to keep going. But what I recommend is to help your partner avoid triggers and anything that would make him/her get in contact with cigarettes. Some things he did:

* timed it to where he didn't have work or school so he could just stay home as much as possible the first week and thus not be tempted to buy a pack. I know this isn't feasible for everyone, but I think it worked for J.
* avoided parties or hanging around people who smoke. He would hang out with a non-smoking friend and would have the friend drive when they went places.
* bought a new video game and spent most of the day playing that. Video games can be a great distraction to prevent you from smoking.
* didn't go to any gas stations for the first few weeks. I got gas  by myself when we needed it.
* stayed calm and relaxed. I avoided asking him to do stuff around the house. If there is any kind of non-addictive medication or drug that helps you relax, maybe alcohol if you're not prone to overdoing it/being triggered to smoke, or even something like tea, that can be a big help. Just have to get through the first week!


How I helped:

* I made him a chip like they use in AA. I used a poker chip and put paper on it starting at 12 hours, 18 hours, 1 day, etc. I think this really helped. He was excited for me to update his chip every day and he carries it with him at all times as a reminder of his progress.
* I got him a treat every day for the first week or two. Usually a milkshake or something like that. 
* Constant encouragement, obviously. Stuff like, "You smell so good!" "I'm so proud of you!" "You've made it 3 days!" etc. is great all day long. I brag to all our friends and family about his accomplishment! Their praise means a lot to him too.
* We went out to eat at a place of his choice for milestone amounts of time quit.
* We talked about it a lot! J never wanted to talk about his smoking when he smoked. Once he quit, he wanted to talk all the time about the changes he experienced, reasons for quitting, etc. 

Two resources that help as well are Allen Carr's book and the Kwit app, which tracks your milestones with achievements. Your partner might take it out on you if the cravings make him/her rage. Don't take it personally! It's just the nicotine causing it. Let your partner punch a pillow, shout, whatever helps and just maintain a calm, encouraging tone. Do your best to help your partner make the right decision (not buying cigarettes), but remember that it is his/her decision. When J had a rough day and bought a pack, he ultimately traded me the rest of the pack for his chip. 

Reasons to quit/what we discussed over and over:

* You're not giving up anything. It's like if you were a cutter. Do you lose anything by stopping cutting? No, you were hurting yourself by doing that. 
* Smoking doesn't help anything. In fact, it will make the situation worse because now you've messed up your streak and have to start over.
* If you have one cigarette, your brain will tell you to have more. If you don't have one, eventually your brain will forget about it. The craving is the RESULT of having a cigarette.
* You can ALWAYS go outside and take a break if you want to. Get on your phone outside or take a walk. You don't have to smoke to do that!
* J has been smoking for basically his whole adult life, so he was excited to see who/what he would be like without cigarettes. The aches and pains you live with could be a result of smoking, not aging!

Unexpected benefits:

* J has always been SUCH a deep sleeper. It really caused a lot of problems in our relationship because I had to wake him up and it was not easy. Now he's like a normal person!! It's truly an amazing transformation. I've only known him as a smoker so I had no clue this would change.
* He's enjoying smelling everything now! Food tastes better as well. We went to a candle store last week and just sniffed everything. This has been really cool for him. 
* He is a lot happier! The feeling of accomplishing something like this has a huge impact on your life. If you feel like things aren't going well for you (breakup, unemployed, etc.), quitting smoking could actually make your life better because you have the great feeling of accomplishing something you've wanted to do for a long time.

J actually never had headaches, stomach problems, or any other side effects, just bad cravings. If you can get through the first two weeks, that's the hardest part! Just try to stay distracted as much as possible and avoid your triggers. The cravings DO get less frequent and less strong. 

It's really tough being with a smoker. Ultimately it is up to each person to decide whether you want to stay with your partner or not, but if your partner does decide to quit, I hope my advice helps! Please let me know if you have any questions (or advice for me!).

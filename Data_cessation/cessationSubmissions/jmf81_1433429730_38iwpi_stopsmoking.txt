Hello cravings, my old friend

So was sitting watching TV having a pretty easy cravings free day when bang I got a massive craving. "Hello cravings, my old friend" popped into my head immediately. So I decided I'd try and reword "The Sound of Silence" by Simon and Garfunkel until the craving passed. I gave up after the first verse as I'm not that creative haha. It helped distract myself though :-)

Hello cravings my old friend,
Youâ€™ve come to torture me again,
You come to me when I am sleeping,
I wake up almost weeping,
And the cravings that were planted in my brain,
slowly fade,
within the sound of winning.
P.S. I'm bored!

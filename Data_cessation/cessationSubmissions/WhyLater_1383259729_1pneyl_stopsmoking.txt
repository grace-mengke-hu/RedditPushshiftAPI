How to deal with the Infinite Hunger?

Hey all, I just passed the 72-hour mark.  First, the good news: my withdrawals are becoming fewer, my cravings are sparse (and I'm having no problem resisting them - addiction logic is easy to refute once you know how), and I can even be around my smoking friends with little to no trouble.  :)

Here's the problem.  I know that increase in hunger is somewhere between very common and universal after quitting.  I just didn't realize how marked it would be!  As an example - yesterday, I ate three bowls of delicious, filling food (one of jambalaya and two of an awesome casserole) in the hour before leaving for work.  I worked for 5 hours, and by the time I left work I was absolutely starving.  I ate two more bowls when I got home.  At that point, I realized that my stomach was full, but *I still wanted to eat more*.

Now, I get the science.  Dopamine receptors, yadda yadda.  And I know that stuffing my face as often as I can is not a good solution.  So the question is, what can I do to reduce the Infinite Hunger?

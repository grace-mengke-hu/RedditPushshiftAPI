I stopped before the disgusting stop-smoking ads, have they actually helped any of you?

As a former smoker, I get it. We need to tell people about the dangers of smoking. But really? I have to scramble for the remote every time a stop-smoking ad is played. Personally I think they are way over the top. I'm waiting to see one where someone actually dies during the commercial from a smoking related disease. Am I way off here? Have these commercials helped anyone on here?

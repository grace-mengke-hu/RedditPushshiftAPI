50 days without Smoking!

I quit cold turkey 50 days back because every time I did some activity, I would run out of breath. I m in much better shape now. Switching to Vaping really helped along with nicotine gums, coffee, tea and some friends who stopped me from buying a pack or even sharing one cigarette with anyone.

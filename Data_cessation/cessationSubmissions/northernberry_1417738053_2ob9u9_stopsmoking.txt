Just quit smoking and it feels absolutely amazing!

Hey everyone! So I just quit smoking after having surgery for IC (painful bladder syndrome) along with severe acid reflux and honestly it has lifted a lot of guilt that I've lived with while being a smoker. The typical thoughts about cancer and how I was managing to dig myself into a deeper hole with my medical conditions was starting to wear me down. I hope everyone else is having a healthy and easy journey to ridding this awful habit. Also to anyone out there with medical conditions and their doctors have advised them to quit smoking, please do it now! It's not worth it to struggle in pain and discomfort for something as pointless as a cigarette.

other people make different choices

the other day i passed by someone smoking a cigarette.  walking down a back alley to get my /r/decaf coffee with the regular group of co-workers.

saw them smoking that ciggy and had an odd thought... different people make different choices that aren't mine.  There was tinges of like "oh that looks kinda nice"  but mostly it was thinking how other people make different choices than me.  they overeat while I don't.  Some people make choices to be criminals.  Some people make choices to kill other people.  Some people make choices to watch a tv show that i hate.  some people make all sorts of different choices.  and their choices aren't necessarily mine.  

made me feel a bit more rationale about my own.  he was making a choice that i wasn't, simple as that.  he's going to be in worse health than me.  There's people who make choices to be in the gym 6 days a week and they're healthier than me.  they're just choices.  and seeing someone else make a different choice than me doesn't mean anything about me.

today i walked by a where someone had just been smoking a cigarette and it was repugnant.  so glad i have left that vice behind.  making some good choices lately

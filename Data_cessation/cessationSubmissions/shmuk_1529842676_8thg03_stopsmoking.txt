[day 6] no sex drive?

im on day 6 of quitting cold turkey but since i quit ive noticed i have no sex drive, i used to masturbate twice a day and get erections just at the sight of some women but now its just nothing? i mean im sure i could masturbate if i wanted to but it just feels weird like i dont get turned on at all like i used too, has this happened to anyone else?

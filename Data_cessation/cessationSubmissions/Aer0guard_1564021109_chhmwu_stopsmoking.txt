Tips for not smoking while drinking?

Hi y’all, I was just wondering does anyone have tips/things they’ve done to not smoke while on a night out with friends/ having drinks with mates?I know “just say no” is the most obvious option but easier said than done, especially if you’ve had one too many drinks. 

Just curious to see what others have tried!

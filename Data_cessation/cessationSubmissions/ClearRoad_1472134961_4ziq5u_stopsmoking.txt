Planning my quit date

I stopped smoking cigarettes 8 years ago but then 4 years later I took up vaping. It's become as much of a dependency as cigarettes, and it's really annoying that I feel I can't function without an e-cigarette. Sure, it's better than smoking, but it's better just not to smoke at all. It affects my confidence that I constantly need to vape just to feel okay. I used a book by Gillian Riley last time I stopped, called " How to stop smoking and stay stopped for good" and it worked for me. Her approach is based on learning to accept the desire to smoke whenever you feel it, and embracing the freedom to make the choice not to, instead of trying to get away from the desire. So, I bought the book today, I'm working my way through it and building up to a quit date.

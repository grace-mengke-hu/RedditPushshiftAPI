No cigarettes for a week, but still waking up with the gross yellow tongue, what gives?

Titalt says it all really. I've been off cigarettes for 7 days now, using only patches and an inhalator but I'm still getting that yellowy build up on my tongue overnight. It's a little disheartening, seeing as the disgusting mouth was one of my main motivations to finally give up smoking, so I was wondering if anyone here can shed some light on what's going on. 

Is this normal?
Is the inhalator causing it?

Any and all answers appreciated. Thanks in advance.

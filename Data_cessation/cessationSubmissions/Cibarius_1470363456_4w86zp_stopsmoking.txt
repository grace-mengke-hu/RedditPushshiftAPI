I have mastered the work day

14 year smoker. I'm 32. 

I no longer need to smoke during the day. 

My trouble is down time. 

I also drink... (I know, don't drink either)

I have 2 bad habits that take up my evenings.

I need philosophical help. 

Or a life coach to help me grow into my budding family better. 

10 y/o step son and baby on the way.
I'm a very hard working electrical apprentice and I live in motels all week until I get to see my family for 2 days on the weekend. I have to cram selfish relaxation, father/son bonding, husband/wife bonding and health and a sense of rest and well being into 2 days.

Ok ready set go

angry

I dont know if nicotice is numbing feelings, or only anger, because when i was smoking i felt sometimes really sad, but not angry. 
Today though i was added to conversation on FB with old "friends" from the high school. It was only because the school is right now in some bad situation, because of one teacher(news and stuff). I wont go into details about that. 

The things is, i was bullied by them in the high school and their harmless conversation triggered something in me. Seems like nothing changed, they are still fake, still measuring e-penis with each other. It made me so mad so i just wrote: This conversation is pissing me off, bye.

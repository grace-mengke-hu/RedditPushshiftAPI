Set my quit date!

I have been planning to quit smoking for years now and yesterday when I was smoking a cigarette I decided to quit on August 30, 2013.  I have been smoking for 12 years.  I quit twice in the past for about 3 months each time using Allen Carr's book and once for 3 month using an e-cig.  I am not going to use the e-cig this time because I ended up ingesting more nicotine from the e-cig than just smoking because I use that e-cig at my desk at work and in my house (I don't smoke in my house).  I live with a smoker so that should be an interesting part of the process but I'm ready to quit and look forward to what the future holds.

Constant cough since I've quit

I've been smoking and vaping on and off since I was 18. I recently went about 3 years without consistently smoking, but sadly I feel back into a mixed cigarette vaping daily habit since January started due to job stress. I just quit cold turkey about a week ago and I feel pretty alright, little bit tired and cravings, but thats the worst of it. 

The only frustrating part is I have a really bad and really productive hacking cough. Tons of thick phlegm coming up, like I swear I've produced enough phlegm to fill a 2 liter bottle in the past week. I've heard this is normal because nicotine paralyzes your cilia and quiting allows you to clean the tar out of your lungs, but how much longer is this going to last?

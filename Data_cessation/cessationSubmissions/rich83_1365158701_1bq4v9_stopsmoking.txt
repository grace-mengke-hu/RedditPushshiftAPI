1 month free with niquitin lozenges

i started using the niquitin mini lozenges 4 mg 4 weeks ago today and im still smoke free, first 4 days are still a struggle but it gets easier day by day, i smoked last weekend when i had a drink but next day i picked up my lozenges and carried on from there, i wouldnt recommend tho as had a bad 4 days again but i pulled through and feel good again, im now using the 1.4 mg lozenges and still going strong, when you first take the lozenges they are nasty and make you feel sick but you soon get used to them and start to like them, maybe a bit too much but its better then inhaling burning weeds allday aint it? just find the method that works best for you and stick to it :)

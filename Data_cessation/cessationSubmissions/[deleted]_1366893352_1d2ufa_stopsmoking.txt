I'm starting today.

I just bought a pack yesterday too.. I'm considering giving it to a friend who smokes or some random stranger who smokes...I just don't want to do it anymore..It hurts and i can't even keep up with my old basketball buddies anymore...I hope this can help me regain some of my old luster.

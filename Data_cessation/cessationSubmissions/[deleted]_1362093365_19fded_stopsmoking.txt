Two months!

I've been lurking, but figured I should post on a mile marker! It hasn't been too bad lately (though, I admit the first few weeks were a living hell), smoking is just something that I miss now. A lot. And every so often have to fight myself not to stop missing. But I'm noticing less cravings.

If it weren't for this subreddit and reading other peoples' experiences, I wouldn't have been able to do it. I turned to this site entirely too often when I was trying to talk myself out of going to the gas station. 

So, thanks for saving my ass for two months!

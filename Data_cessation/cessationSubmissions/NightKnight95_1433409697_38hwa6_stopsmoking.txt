Third Day

Just stumbled upon this sub-reddit. Full of cool ex-smokers who are willing to dispense advice and what not. Awesome!

Day 3 of my quitting smoking. I've been using the [Nicorette Inhalator](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41n7u3CHTIL._SY300_.jpg) which is helping pretty well.

Quick backstory - I tried quitting this time last year, but after a month of being cigarette and nicotine free, my Irritable Bowel Syndrome flared and I was doomed with the worst anxiety and depression I've ever experienced. I've since received counselling and been on anti-depressants to take the edge of the anxiety but the only thing that ever helped was smoking. I started again and within days I was back to my old self.

I'm trying again - started my mission 3 days ago. I have never had a problem releasing myself from nicotine. It is the habit of smoking that I have become addicted to. The slow breathing in and out was like meditation for me. I will post here every few days or so because I think it will help :3 

I have a few questions if anyone would care to answer them for me:

* Has anyone found a link between quitting smoking and bowel problems flaring up? 
* Does anyone else feel 'empty' like something is 'missing'? Has anyone found something to replace their smoking? 

Thanks guys. Wish me luck <3

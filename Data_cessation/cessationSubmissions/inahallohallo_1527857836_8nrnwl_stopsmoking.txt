Hello everybody, I quitted smoking 11 days ago at 9pm. So, when I woke up the next day I could count some hours as a non\-smoker ;\) Perfect start \- Easy things help. I want to tell you about my personal experiences so far, and my thoughts. The app told me I should get in the community and I think it is a good thing to read other peoples issues and ideas.

I decided to love myself and my body, my lungs, my skin, my cells \+\+\+ I wrote this on a paper: Ich liebe mich. Something changed inside me; I´ll tell you the reasons later. My day starts now with fresh orange juice and a banana, and it just feels good and easy. And of course, I still drink my coffee in the morning. I only wanna get rid of one vicious habit ;\)

No guilty conscience regarding my family \(mother!\) and my boyfriend. He is really against smoking and we often had conversation about this topic. You can imagine my point of view … I do what I want blabla … and you can imagine his pov ;\) … you have to quit \+ it´s poison blabla … 

At the moment he is working for two month in another country. I think I would never have stopped smoking when he was around me because of the subconscious pressure. The first days I kept my secret and told nobody about it. I am not sure why I had to do it like that. I think I did not want to hear any word of admission, because it would have sound for me like a lie or like sarcasm. I am not easy.

After some days I installed the smokefree app, told my boyfriend and told my collegues that I quitted smoking. You can not imagine \- how \- happy \- my \- boyfriend \- was. His reaction on the phone was so \(…\) surprised, deep and true and I will never forget this moment I told him. 

I work as a freelancer and I am only for two projects in the company. One smoking collegue told me that he also wanted to stop smoking. He stopped smoking for 4 month, but then I came to the company and I was the reason why he started again. I did not know that, really, and I felt like a monster. But it showed me how addicted he is. How addicted we are all. And it can come out any time for very little reason. I seduced him with a question. Sweet nicotin \- I was shocked.

I am a smoker since I was 14 years old, so I smoked for 18 years. More than half of my life. My mother always tried to keep me away from drugs and alcohol, and she never smoked one cigarette in her life. And I never dare to smoke in her presence. She is really into natural body purification, and lives a very healthy self\-determined way of life. When I told her on the phone that I stopped smoking for some days she gave me some inspiration how to clean my body, of course. And this time I heard her voice and I was not angry on her because I realized that she does not want to hurt me with her shitty stuff. She loves me and this is the reason why she always wanted me to change my life. I have so many things to learn. Try to accept advice of your beloved ones. 

I smoked 20 cigarettes a day, and I never tried to stop in the last 18 years. I always told myself, that when I quit I only quit once \- This is a promise I gave myself. So this is the biggest chance I have now. Until 11 days ago I spent over €20.000,\- for cigarettes. \(it´s more\) I still love the smell of cigarettes, and I think the desire for a cigarette will never stop. I am sweating that much in the night and therefore I can not sleep. I feel like a junkie ;\) Detox! But I know why it is like this, why I feel unhappy \(metabolism, dopamine \+\+\+\) and that it will get better after some time. And of course there are some things that are already better after 11 days. For example: My blood pressure was very high \(or low?\), and I had „heavy legs“ in the evening. I realized that there is a connection … My legs look much better, too. \(if you know what I mean\) …

My trick is, that I do not avoid the places I went as a smoker. I do not change my behaviour in general. That´s out of the question. One day after I quit I walked through Berlin and went in every Späti I passed. I bought chewing gum, water, sweets \+\+\+ but no cigarettes. It helped me a lot. Yesterday I was invited in a restaurant with collegues, and we drank lots of white wine and many of them smoked. I though more than once about to smoke a cigarette while I got drunk more and more. But I did not. Well done. 

Now I want to tell you about my crucial factor. It is not a big thing and it is allowed to laugh. I saw the Netflix series „Call the midwife“ \(no joke \- I love custume series and films … hach ;\)\) and there is one scene that really impressed me. A very intelligent little boy with pollio is kidding his father \- a smoking doctor \- that he wants to start smoking. The father´s reaction is shocked and angry … how he could do this stupid thing. And he realized what he said and the next day he quits smoking. That´s it. It is showing all the dimensions of addiction, how stupid and dangerous it is. And how easy it is to do something NOT. 

„Nichts ist schwerer und nichts erfordert mehr Charakter, als sich in offenem Gegensatz zu seiner Zeit zu befinden und laut zu sagen: Nein.“ [Kurt Tucholsky](https://www.aphorismen.de/autoren/person/4254/Kurt+Tucholsky)

Und hier noch etwas, dass ich nur schwer auf englisch schreiben kann mit Gedanken zu einem Tucholsky Zitat. Ich bin wahrlich kein Denker, aber bei diesem Zitat geht es um Zivilcourage. Man kann das beim Thema rauchen auch auf sich selbst anwenden \- Nein sagen. Wenn das, was wir uns durch Kippen antun, uns jemand anderes antun würde, dann wäre es mit all seinen Folgen für Körper, Seele und Leben wirklich unverzeihlich.

Stay tuned!!! Ina

Feeling worried

My quit date is this coming Monday and I've done what I can to prepare. I've wrote down why I want to quit, started to cut down what I do smoke.

 I was wondering once it happens, does anyone have any tips for managing the irritability/anger side of things? I'm an emotionally sensitive person and I work in a bar so I'm feeling anxious about not being able to cope at work with the irritable/angry feelings and not being able to concentrate.

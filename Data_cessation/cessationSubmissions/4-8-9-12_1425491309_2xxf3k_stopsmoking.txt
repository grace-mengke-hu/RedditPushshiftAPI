Cravings

Had my last cigarette on Sunday and was well prepared for the cravings. Until today, the cravings would come in as a wave and then dissipate within a few minutes. For some reason, today, day-3 and the cravings have been present as one giant craving since I woke up for work this morning. I'm rationalizing a cigarette. I want one. I know that i'll have to start over and I know that this craving is actually me winning the battle against nicotine addiction. I'm starting to think that I don't care. I just want the feeling gone and I want to smoke. Just one.

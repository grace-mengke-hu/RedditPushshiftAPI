Day Three.

I've been putting this off I don't want to scare anyone. I just hit the 72 hour mark. Fuck, I'm miserable. The coughing only starts at night when I'm trying to go to bed. The headache is constant. I feel like I have been beaten up. Yes, I saw a doctor on Monday because I was getting sick to begin with. I missed two days of work. Missed school today. I'm falling behind. I can't afford to smoke and right now it feels like I can't afford NOT to. Yes, I have a patch on. And help is appreciated.

Relapse after 3 months

I started smoking again. But I'm here for a new quit! I smoked around 2 weeks, after 3 months of not smoking, and I hope the withdrawal will go smooth. I mean I hope I will not kill anybody. Please non smokers send me your good non smoking vibes so I can become one of you once more.

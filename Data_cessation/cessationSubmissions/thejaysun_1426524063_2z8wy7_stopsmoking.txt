50 Days!

This is the longest I have gone and years, and while I still have the habit because I'm using an e-smoke I still feel great about it. I am now just working my way down in nicotine levels with the juice, but to not have had a single puff off of one of those disgusting life suckers in 50 days feels truly amazing. That is easily over 1000 cigs that I didn't light. Happy quitting everyone!!!

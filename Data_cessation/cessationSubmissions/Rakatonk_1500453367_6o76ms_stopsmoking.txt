Just quit this morning

My gf and I wanted to quit a while ago, but we never managed to. My solution to this was changing from cigarettes to vaping and reducing the nicotine step by step, but she didn't like it. The discussion was followed by an argue which ended with something like "Well, when I'm not allowed to vape (and smoke), you quit, too."
And here we are, we had our last cigarette last evening (12 hours ago) and I'm already starting to get angry about everything and everyone. Everything my coworkers do is annoying me. Everything my customers say or do is annoying me. And I don't want to start with the deliverers and manufacturers.
To cope with that issue I wanted to take a half day off, but my teammate won't let me (whyever, there is no logical reasoning behind that) and I feel like I burst into flames later this day. I don't want to ask for cigarettes to calm my nerves, too.
Worst day ever.

Please guys, give me some advise.

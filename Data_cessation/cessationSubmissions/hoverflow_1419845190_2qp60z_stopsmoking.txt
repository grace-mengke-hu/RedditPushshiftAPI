Message to all new (and newish) quiters after 150 days

Hi Guys. I am probably similar to more than one of you- I couldn't really imagine life without cigarettes in the beginning. But after 150 days- boy, is it easier than I thought! It really does become an easy thing and non issue. Believe me. It is worth it on every level.

Stay strong and fight for a better life!

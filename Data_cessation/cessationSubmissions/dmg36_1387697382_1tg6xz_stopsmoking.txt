5 days?

Ok, im now on day 5 of not smoking a cigarette. Since then I had three nicotine chewing gums and two days ago I was stupid and bought a pack of cigarillos for social things. I "smoked" 6 in total Though I didnt inhale I feel a bit like cheating and I will now throw them away or not touch them at least. I just wanted to confess that so I hope this confession helps me keep on track. Thx!

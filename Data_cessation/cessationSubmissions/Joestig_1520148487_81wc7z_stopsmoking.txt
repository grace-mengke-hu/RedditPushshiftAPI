10 days in. 10's of thousands will follow!

I have done several attempt to quit, but now I am really done with it. I got the flu and smoking only made it worse. Even without the flu, smoking affects my lungs pretty negatively. They say that when you quit that your lung function can increase by more than 30%. That is a huge increase, and I have seen it during past attempts. Everything from running to walking stairs became much easier. Something to look forward to!

Btw, I also quit alcohol 100 days ago. Can't say that I really miss it. I like to drink tea now, and the occasional soda or juice. This proves to me that habits and taste can really change. I expect that when I have not smoked for 100 days that I will find it hard to imagine that I ever smoked.

Will go to the gym now. My lungs are not in top shape, but I want to be able to see my endurance improving while my lungs heal. Also, I want to prevent the weight gain, or even continue to lose, as I have just lost 17 kgs.

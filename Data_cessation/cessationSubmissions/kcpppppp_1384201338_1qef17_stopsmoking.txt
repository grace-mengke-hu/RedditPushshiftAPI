How I quit smoking

Backstory: I have smoked for over 20 years. I quit for a few months back in 2005 but quickly started smoking again after going to an alcohol-fueled party. I was back up to a pack a day within a week.

This year, I was lucky enough to have a baby girl. I decided to cut back on my smoking because I didn't want her to be harmed by my smoking. So I set a goal of only having a maximum 5 cigarettes a day. And, if I did have a cigarette, I vowed that I would have a shower, brush my teeth and change my clothes before I interacted with my baby. With this method and the help from nicorette gum, I was able to get my smoking down to 2 a day (1 before work, 1 after work). 

I haven't smoked since Friday. I think my body quit smoking before my brain did. Now, whenever I think about having a cigarette, it seems so foreign to me and I can't even imagine actually having a cigarette. When the cravings get a little rough, I have half a piece of nicorette gum and the craving just flies away.

I don't actually consider myself a "nonsmoker" yet. It's only been a couple of full days not smoking. But I just can't envision myself ever having a smoke again so I doubt I ever will even have a puff. Just one puff could stop the momentum I have. I also received a lot of support from the smokershelpline website, and various other stop smoking websites and I have thoroughly enjoyed going through this subreddit and reading posts that interest me. I thank you all for sharing your information which has helped me and others to finally quit the habit.

TL;DR: I accidentally quit smoking by setting a goal of 5 cigarettes a day.

Tomorrow I will hit another cool milestone. It's been challenging as fuck, but also rewarding to the same amount. I'd like to share some of my experience for the ones who are just starting, and it isn't meant to be a guide, just overall tips that have helped me during this process. Everyone knows about all the health issues produced by smoking, so I won't get into detail.

- Never set a date to start quitting. Because the only moment that matters is now. Future is uncertain where present is what builds future little by little. This is, don't fool yourself saying, I'll quit after this package, or I'll quit after this concert, because we all know this almost never happens. Instead, when you are about to light that cigarrete, STOP right on your tracks.

- Dont fool yourself. If you fail, don't give yourself permission to keep smoking since you've already done it again. Man/woman up and STOP again everytime and immediately.

- Get rid of smokers in your life. This may sound rough, but I stopped seeing all my smoker friends completely except for one who agreed to stop smoking with me. The others, either they understand your decision and stop smoking while you are present (which makes them very uncomfortable) or they simply won't care and will keep smoking. Which makes you feel terrible. When I tried to quit like 3 years ago, my friends didn't care and kept smoking. I swear my cravings were so intense that literally brought tears to my eyes and made me salivate a lot. And I ended up smoking with them.

- Throw away everything you used for smoking. But don't make this on a whim. Because you might regret it later. Make this only after convincing yourself that this is the best for you. Don't save your favorite lighter, even if it's a fancy one. Specially that one. Whenever you see it, you'll associate it with smoking.

- Split your ego. Part of my success so far is that in my mind, I always treat my cravings and that inner voice that tell you: 'Just one more! It won't make a difference!' - as another personality, as an inner demon who is trying to take control of my life. Despise him and don't you ever do as it says, because everytime you do it, you are losing the control over your own life.

- Always remember that satisfying your cravings comes with the cost of destroying your life quality and eventually your life. It's not worth it.

[Watch this short video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztp0vHSSVqM) - this may seem stupid, but this is how smokers look like. Doing even the stupidest things to keep smoking.

I'd also like to thank everyone in this subreddit. Reading to your testimonies and stories made me stronger and happier. Knowing it's doable and people are vanquishing this addiction is always reassuring. I love you guys.

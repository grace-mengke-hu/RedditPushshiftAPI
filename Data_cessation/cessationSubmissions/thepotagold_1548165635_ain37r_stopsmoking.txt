pack a day smoker at 19, had my last cigarette and need tips to keep it that way

had my first ever cigarette at 12, started smoking at 14, i am now only 19 and smoking a pack a day, all ive wanted for the past 2 years is to quit, i cant breath, to much life ive lost cause i cause i spent my money on cigarettes, to many failed relationships cause of it, if i don't do it now, my life will just be a just whole cigarette, im the worst smoker you can ever meet and im only 19, i tried a hundred time to quit and havent even made it past 24 hrs, champix, patches, vaping, nothing worked , doing it cold turkey, 

I need some tips, to many failed half asses attempts, no one in my family has ever been able to quit

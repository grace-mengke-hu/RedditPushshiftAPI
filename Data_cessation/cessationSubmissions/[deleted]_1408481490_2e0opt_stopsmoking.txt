YOU GUYS, I DID IT!

I found this sub over a year ago. I lurked for a bit, read some posts, and found a reference to the book Allen Carr's Easy Way To Stop Smoking. I bought it immediately, but put off reading it out of a fear of failure. I was scared to attempt quitting and failing. So that book sat unread in my kindle library for almost a year. Until now. I've just finished the book, and consequently, my last cigarette. AND I AM SO HAPPY! I was rejoicing while taking those last few drags, not because I was savoring the cigarette, but because I was so excited that it was my last one ever. Thank you guys for existing. I am so excited to start this new journey as a non-smoker. YIPPEE I'M FREE!

Edit: So /u/prophet999 mentioned that there was an Allen Carr documentary. I'm not sure if this is what they were talking about, but I did find a movie currently up on Youtube titled [Allen Carr's Easy Way To Stop Smoking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2KbMsJ9a4w)

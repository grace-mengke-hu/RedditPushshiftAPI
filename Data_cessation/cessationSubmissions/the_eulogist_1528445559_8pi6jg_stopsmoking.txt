What am I doing

Dads side of the fam, super Mormon, Zero smokers. 

Moms side, lots of smoking and alcohol abuse. 

I grew up in Utah, super Mormon, bounced as an almost Mormon missionary. Picked up smoking at 19 via PrimeTimes which I pretended were cigars. Jumped to Marlboro menthols because they weren’t really cigarettes. And then camel lights. 

Finally landed on Marlboro lights and now I’m 30 with two kids, married to a European, and twice a week i binge a 15ish+ cigs. 

Mention ththe European because it only kind of bothers her. 

Hate it. Tripping. Maybe I’m posting this in the wrong place. 

Booze and cigs go hand and hand.

Yesterday!

Hey guys! Just quit yesterday. This is my second time. I have big goals and reasons for quitting this time, so I think it's actually going to last. What were some of your guy's first week experiences? So far both time's Ive been really twitchy.. but not energetic. I bounce my legs and tap my hands a LOT more (I did it even when I smoked). But I just feel lethargic at times. It's like an energy rollercoaster.

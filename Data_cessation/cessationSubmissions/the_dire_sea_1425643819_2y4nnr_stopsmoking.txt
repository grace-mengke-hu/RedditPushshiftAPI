quitting smoking and anxiety

Hi!

I took a break from smoking two months ago. I'm not sure if I want to quit entirely. Right now it's only about proving myself, that I can leave it for a while. I still smoke weed (without tobacco) and occasionally cigars.

About three weeks after quitting I got strange "anxiety attacks" (I'm not sure if this is the right word). It's a state of enclosing nervousness. Everything starts to bother me, I can't be around people, real and imaginative threads seem unbearable and I start to have dreams without closing my eyes. That happened about four times now. 

This never occurred before and I consider myself to be a bright and mellow person. I don't have any stress right now. I'm not working a lot and my live is more relaxed then ever. 

I thought that it's maybe connected to smoking. Has any of you guys experienced something similar?

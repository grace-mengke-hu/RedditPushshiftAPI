Advice on preparing for a trigger-filled 3 weeks

So I've made it to day 17 and I'm happy as a clam. I'm still occasionally using nicorette gum but I'm going to run out soon and I will not buy again.  


My mother is coming for a visit in 2 weeks and I haven't seen her in 5 months. She is a chain-smoker and there is something about seeing her on the balcony smoking that is just so inviting. It feels like a bonding activity and she opens up to me when we're out smoking.  


Do you have any advice for dealing with this kind of trigger?  


 I thought about buying a pack, leaving it out, staring at it and not smoking a single one just as practice. I want to be very strong when my mother comes.

Laser treatment for quitting smoking. Does anyone know anyone who has used this method? Did it work?

I've already made the appointment, it's been almost 8 years of on again off again.  I have tried a lot of different methods some work for a little while.  I managed to quit for about a year with the patch, but fell back into the swing of things.  Any information would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks.

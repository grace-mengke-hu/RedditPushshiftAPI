Nicorette Addiction?

Hi - so I've quit smoking for about 4 years now (smoked for about 7-8 years). However, I've picked up a Nicorette Lozenge addiction during those 4 years. I'm currently weening  myself off of this stuff, but I was wondering if anybody had experience with the actual nicotine/nicorette withdrawal symptoms? what they are (if different from cigarette nicotine) and/or how to manage them? The dose I've been using are 2mg. I also have been drinking of plenty water, and using spearmint mints.

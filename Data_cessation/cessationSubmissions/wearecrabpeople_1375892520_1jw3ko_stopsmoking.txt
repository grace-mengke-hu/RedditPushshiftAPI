Quit smoking today! But feel sick to my stomach.

Ok so I'm on Chantix to quit. Today is my quit day. It's been ~20 hours since my last cigarette. I have been feeling sick in my stomach and nauseous the last few days (taking 2 pills a day) so I only took 1/2 pill this morning and I'm still feeling horrible. I had to concentrate all day at work on not throwing up. Anyone else have these symptoms with either chantix or nicotine withdrawal?

Day 3 - I'm going insane

I've quit smoking 3 days ago, day 1 and 2 were fine. But ever since waking up this morning I feel like dying. The mood swings are extreme. One minute I'm giggling and laughing about everything and the next minute I'm lying in bed crying about god knows what.
I screamed at a lot of people today for absolutely no reason and I really feel bad for being so aggressive. Is there anything I can do to make it through this day without murdering someone? Have any of you had similar experiences? Will this ever get better?

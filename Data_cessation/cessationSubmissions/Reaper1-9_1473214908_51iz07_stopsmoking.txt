Thinking about pulling the plug tomorrow.

I've been smoking for about 11 years. I'm 27.

Over the past few years I have developed quite the case of health anxiety. Anytime I feel something off, I'm convinced it's something terrible and terminal. A couple weeks ago I had some sort of tonsillitis; no pain but swelling in my tonsils and those fun little white patches. I took a course of antibiotics and the swelling went down and the white patches have gone away but I've still had this crazy amount of phlegm which makes swallowing a pain and has made my tonsils swell up a bit. Every now and then I'll have a thought pop in my head like "it's probably throat cancer or lymphoma."

The point is, smoking isn't doing anything for my physical *or* mental health. I have about 3/4 of a pack left and I'll probably be through with it by about midday tomorrow. I'm thinking after that, I'm done. But then I have a vacation coming up in a couple weeks and I'll want to smoke. Smoking "helps" with my anxiety. I keep thinking of all these reasons NOT to quit, but I know I need to.

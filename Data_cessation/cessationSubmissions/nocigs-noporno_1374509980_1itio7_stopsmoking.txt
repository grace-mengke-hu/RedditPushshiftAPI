50 days

Jezz went by so fast.  I dont even get urges anymore.  I forgot how it was to be a smoker.  I didn't spend $561.00.  I bought a day pack every other day when i was a smoker for about 5 years, smoked for 7 but not heavy up intill the second year.  It's all thanks to Allen carr.  Imp all other methods are flawed.  Try the patch, the ecig, the gum,  even try chewing tobacco.  All failed me bc i wasn't quiting what i was addicted to.  Cold turkey didn't work for me bc i would be freaking out about how long i could go without smoking.  Not really giving in to the fact that i was a nonsmoker.  Well I did it.  Its easy and everyone who is a smoker can too.  Just read Allen carr's Easy way to quite smoking.  I mean Really read it full heartedly and it will work.  Thanks for reading this if you did and thanks to /r/stopsmoking for telling me about Allen carr's book.  This book should have its own commercial,  Not that chantix shit.

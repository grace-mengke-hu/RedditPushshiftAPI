embarking on day 6 of my quitting. Feeling amazing!

Hello it will be day 6 since my quitting and day 16 since my firs quitting (had a relapse of 1 cigarette on day 10).

Feel amazing and great, very hopeful and cheerful full of pride and energy. This has motivated me to do other changes in my lifestyle. Such as diet and exercise. I am contemlating getting a card for swimming so that I can go swim more regularl. Cravings are gone, knock on wood. Yesterday even refused a cigarette offered to me by a friend. To everyone who is quitting now, stay strong it gets better!

Thanks for all the help so far!

I didn't make a post on day 14. I was contemplating not posting at all (at least for a long time) after being what I'd consider a dick to everyone whenever I last posted here lol.. I apologize. That irritability was crazy and I didn't want to accept that it was from smoking but it has since passed.

My guard is still up but the days seem to be getting easier. Still no cravings and I'm keeping my fingers crossed but I know what to do if one comes. Thanks again for all the support guys and thanks for putting up with me this far into my journey! <3

Day 9. Still difficult breathing.

Hey everyone! I'm currently on day 9 of quitting after smoking half a pack a day for 4 years. I've been feeling much better, but I'm still having episodes during the day where I feel like I can't breathe very well. Pretty much how I felt when I was smoking. Has anybody else been through this over a week of no smoking? How long until you started to feel better with your breathing?

Today is the day!

I check this sub occasionally for some inspiration, and today I’ve made the decision to give it my best shot at quitting. Today I will smoke my final cigarette. 


I’ve been a smoker for over 12 years, and I’ve quit numerous times. Usually it lasts a few months, the longest around a year. Temptation has gotten the best of me.


I feel time ticking and my body, skin, anxiety and energy are all feeling the effects of cigarettes like I never thought possible. It’s time for a big change- and a lasting one. 


Good luck to everyone! I think determination is key. One change usually brings on many unexpected positive changes, and I’m excited to see who I am a year from today.

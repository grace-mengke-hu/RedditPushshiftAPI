Vanity: how long till skin improves?

Hi all - so while health and self-respect are the biggest reasons to quit, if I'm honest a fairly huge motivation is vanity. Am a 28 (nearly 29) year old woman and worried my skin is ruined after 14 years heavy smoking. I know skin can improve after quitting - has anyone any motivational vanity tales to make my wrinkles smile?

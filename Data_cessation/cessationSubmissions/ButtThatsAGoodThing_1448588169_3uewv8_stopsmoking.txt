When to throw away the ash-tray? Discussion and your opinion.

So I haven't smoked a cigarette since 2015-11-24 15:30 PM. (exactly)

Now I'm toying with a couple of idea's...
People keep telling each other for a reason to work day by day if you stop smoking. Don't jump ahead and think about never smoking for the rest of you're life especially in the early stages! Since you're still physically and mentally into smoking....

Now i still have 3 ash-trays and more lighters than that i have money in my house... One ash-tray is even still full, and it just stands there in the corner... For some reason i find it difficult to throw it all away.

When did you guys throw all the smoking 'accessories' away? Please give me your opinion on the when and why's!

Convinced an hour ago was my last lozenge and nicotine

Hello Reddit, I've been trying to quit through different ways for a few years, trying different things, reading and posting here sometimes. Only recently did I actually start putting my own money into quitting (after all, smoking is even more expensive). I tried getting prescribed NRTs again, and just gave in and started buying them myself.

That was not working in my effort to quit nicotine all together, so I finally gave in and bought Allen Carr's book. I woke up agitated that I was well past 3 months on the lozenges and went out to buy the book, and I was determined to keep trying.

Yep, I'm a hopeless rebel after avoiding to buy it for so many years lol. It's great, though, and it persuaded me something that I could not change forever after the less than 24 hours I read the majority of it.

Anyways, yes I'm awake kind of late. My insomnia is terrible, partly because I had the lozenges a little bit ago. But, I have been pushing off trying to quit until I finished it. Almost done, I'm going to go ahead and just try at my worst trigger. Looking forward to not popping a lozenge into my cheak in public or hopelessly trying to hide it by running to the restroom. And above all else, I hope my sleep improves.

Good luck to all the people trying to quit, and good night :)

Started this year, quit recently after 20 packs, questions.

Sorry if these are common questions:

What can I do to aid my recovery? (don't need help quitting I've quit for good and I'm very determined/passed the withdrawals)

What are my chances of recovering fully? (yeah I know 20 isn't much compared to most people, still curious)

And finally, how often should I get checked for problems (not a fan of the C word) - who should I be seeing about it?

Thank you so much friends, stay strong :)

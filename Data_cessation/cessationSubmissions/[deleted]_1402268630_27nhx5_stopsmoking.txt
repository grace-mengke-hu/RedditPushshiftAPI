I'm not out of the woods just yet. Today was a sure indicator of that.

I've been feeling really down these last few weeks. I'm trying to get a teaching job and keep getting turned down. I can't even get my foot in the door for an interview. It's becoming frustrating. Today, my SO said some things that were not mean, but it upset me to hear them. I felt a whirlwind of failures and set backs just bombarding me all at once. In the past 37 days, I've never wanted a cigarette more than I did today. However, here I am. No cigarettes. Still feeling like a failure in other aspects of my life, but at least I can say that I have not failed at quitting.

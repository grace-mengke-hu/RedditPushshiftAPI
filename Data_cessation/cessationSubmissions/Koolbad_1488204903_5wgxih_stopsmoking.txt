Smoking while partying

I had a good little streak going of over 55 days without even a puff off a cigarette. Well that all came crashing down over the weekend. I got drunk for the first time since I quit and couldn't contain myself. It wasn't just a puff or a smoke, I immediately wanted to smoke every hour or so the whole night. I haven't had one since Saturday night and don't plan to start again. Feel fine today and all. Just wondering, if this is a slippery slope? Allowing myself to smoke when I'm drinking? Or how to avoid it, while still being social and going out. I would love to be that person who could just buy a pack on nights out and then put the remaining cigs in the freezer until the next night out. Not sure I'm that strong though.

At the 3 day mark and feeling depressed...

I've really been around the block with this... now I'm feeling slightly depressed... I know I know... if it persists to see a doctor... This is just so awful. Part or a large part of my problem is financial as I just cannot afford to smoke any longer... neither do I wish to... but to be forced to quit by my own financial situation to me is a real crash and burn kind of no respect way of screwing myself? Anyway... I guess it will get better.

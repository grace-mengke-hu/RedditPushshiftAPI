cold turkey four days in

Quit before for maybe two years. Then relapsed. Then been oscillating between 4mg lozenges and smoking for 2 years.... maybe 60% lozenges, 40% smoking. But I think my nicotine consumption was going up, not down. 

Had an implant on Wednesday, and the dentist said not to smoke. Smoking greatly increases implant failure rates (and really sucks for your teeth and gums overall). So I said f*ck it.... let's do this.... and now I'm 4 days into an unplanned impulse quit.

Got canker sores from the dental work, and I'm on antibiotics so I can't even drink. Triple suck! (Canker sores hurt like a motherf***, and really contribute to anxiety cravings). I know I'm grumpy, distracted and asshole-ish as hell... but people are just gonna have to deal with that. Normality will resume, apologies will be made, and people will forgive..... later.

I have a consulting interview AND a date tomorrow. LOL, let's see how they work out! If they are disasters.... then whatever. I'd rather be a single unemployed non-smoker than to use that as an excuse.

My immediate goal is simple..... just keep putting distance between me and my last nicotine intake. It gets easier as that distance increases. FWIW,  if you don't work weekends, Wednesdays are great quit days.... cos day 3 sucks. So having days 3 and 4 on the weekend really helps.

This sub really helped last time I quit..... and I'm grateful y'all are around. Thank you.

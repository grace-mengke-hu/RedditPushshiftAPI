It's almost like it's become automatic for me

I got out early today so I came home and I'm using the time my child is still at daycare to clean my house. 

A couple days ago I got it into my head that I want to quit smoking. Considering last Wednesday I was willing to quit my job because I knew I wouldn't have anything to smoke that day... it's definitely out of the blue.

So I've been devouring Allan carrs book. He makes a lot of good points.. one of which is that you aren't aware you're even smoking. And right now I keep wanting to stop in my cleaning to go out and smoke. I have some. I bought a pack this morning after going from 630pm to 430am not smoking. That's a huuuuge feat for me.

I'm posting this because I'm thinking about it obsessively but I want to resist as long as i can

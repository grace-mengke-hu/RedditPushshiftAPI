I think I need some encouragement

I've started smoking when I was 14, I'm 22 now and decided to quit yesterday. I was lurking on here for quite some time and it kinda helped me feel like I wasn't the only one battling this drug addiction. (Even though it is super obvious I'm not the only one, I think you guys know what I mean) 

I'm having quite a hard time, this is only my third attempt at quitting and this time I'll stick through. No more puff, not even once. 

Still the anxiety is killing me and I dread the coming hours.

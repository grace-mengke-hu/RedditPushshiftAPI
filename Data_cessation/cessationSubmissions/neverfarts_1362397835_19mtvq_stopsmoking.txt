Yesterday was not easy

Sunday is my day off, and to celebrate that fact I usually take it easy in my p.j.'s, playing video games and relaxing indoors (it's cold outside).

My SO is doing her internship, and she is super stressed about everything. She is also smoking. There is a pack 3 meters from me.

We don't really fight, but there is a lot of tension and irritation. She asks me to help clean around the house, and goes for a meeting. I pause the game (Borderlands 2) and go do the dishes. When the kitchen is almost done, the faucet explodes. By the time I run downstairs to turn the mains off, water is raining on me through the ceiling. took me another 2 hours to soak the water in the kitchen and downstairs and to temporarily plug the now-exploded faucet.

I was sitting on the kitchen floor, soaking wet, alone, cold and depressed. A cigarette pack is on the table next to me. 

Then I said fuck it, turned on the oven and dried myself, and went on to find more loot in my game.

Yesterday was not easy but was good.

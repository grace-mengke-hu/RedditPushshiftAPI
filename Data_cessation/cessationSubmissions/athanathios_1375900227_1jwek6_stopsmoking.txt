X-Post - How Mindfulness and Neuro Associative Conditioning Helped Me Quit a Bad habit

When I naturally started my practice, eventually incorporating Buddha's teaching, Mindfulness was a key to one of my best personal habitual victories, that is quitting smoking. I had read about neuro associative conditioning before and it seemed novel. For those not in the know NAC is a process of associating new values to old habits, for instance if you repeat a new value associated with something, eventually your brain will pick it up and attach a new value to it. Since I could see through my practice that habit tends to be self perpetuating, but reversible through a similar course, I had a novel plan, that's use mindfulness to identify any thought, emotion or physical "pang" that may come up that is rooted in my habit to smoke and assign it new values.

The process was 2 fold, #1, being mindful and being aware of anytime when a smoking related sensation hit and #2, assigning a new value. For #2, I namely went over the reasons not to smoke, they included, for me (but not limited to), not being a physical peak and health risks (heightened BP, higher risk of stroke, heart disease, impaired cardie-vascular function, cancer risk, etc), being emotionally dependent on it, having my "mind space" being taken up by preoccupation of smoking, having my time monopolized by this practice and being financially burdened by it (having to spend too much money). When I combined the two they allowed me to very quickly rewire myself, Mindfulness allowed me to identify and see the smoking related behavior, this often stopped it, but at that point I would go over the reasons again. This became second nature for me and it quickly became an unconscious habit and then a new value that was a more emotional feel than a thought feel. Not only did the craving stop all together, they seldom ever arose again due to the new values. The quick turn around was astounding.

Thanks - Thought I would share.

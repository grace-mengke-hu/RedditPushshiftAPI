Did smoking cause you depression ?

Greetings. 

I (25 m) have been smoking for a few years now, and I usually don't feel the urge to smoke but whenev I'm alone, watching a movie or working, or on a balcony, I light up either cigarette or a blunt.

I stopped once, for 9 months, but that was a long time ago.

I don't know if I want to stop or to smoke less but I don't see myself be a smoker later in my life when I know my potential and how I spent my life being a non-smoker. It was better. 

I also don't like cigarettes alone, I need to drink sodas and add something to the tobacco, like weed, damiana or CBD. It honestly disgustes me to smoke and I have had depression for a long time now. I don't think it is only mental, I feel it has to do with my body. No medical check-up has revealed something unusual.

I do have stomach problems (ulcerative colitis) and it is a known fact among us sick people that stopping smoking can increase symptoms.

But what about depression? Have you ever felt depressed, then stopped smoking and really felt a better mood? The weed is not the problem, I can spend weeks without weed but I'll always find a way to smoke tobacco and try to make it more flavourish because I don't like the taste alone. 

By depressed I mean sometimes suicidal thoughts, less self-esteem, less confidence, the need too smoke alone to process my exhausting days, loss of appetite, loss of trust, less talking, and I love and hate smoking at the same time.
Sports? I do want to build myself up but I eventually give up and smoking makes me feel too tired to keep exercising. 

Any advice? Have you felt kind of the same way?
It's becoming hell.

I’m going to stop smoking on January 1st after 12 years. What good habits can I start now?

I know it will be difficult, but I have set my date and am pretty damn determined to succeed. I’ve got a lot of activities in the next two months that involve being around smoking and drinking, so I don’t want to set myself up for failure, but if I can start doing beneficial stuff now and forming better habits.    
What helped you?

Service Industry Advice - help!!

Hey there!

Until I am able to find a FT job in my profession, I am working at a bar. This bar allows smokers, and the majority of patrons do smoke. Last night we were incredibly slow (for example, a whole three people at one point.) THAT'S when the urges hit. I was so bored I didn't know what else to do with myself! The entire cleaning (and extra cleaning) list was already completed.  So, what do you all do when you're at work, it's boring, and you have the freedom to just kill time doing anything?

Thanks!

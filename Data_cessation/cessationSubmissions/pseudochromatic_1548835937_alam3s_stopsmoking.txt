relapse in quitting has me feeling really disappointed and broken

I know this is a smoking sub but I got addicted 4 months ago to vaping when I started using my friends juul and found it helped with my worsening anxiety disorder. 3 days ago, I was refilling my suorin daily and vaping non stop. When I lost it before I went 2 days without and was lightheaded, nauseous, had trouble understanding basic concepts, and couldn’t visually focus. So I decided to quit. I’ve weened myself down to a 1 minute hit every 2 hours and was gonna make it 3 tomorrow. But I had a horrible night and it’s 2 am and I took a 2 minute hit after only an hour. I know relapses are common, but with everything else in my life going to shit from my depression and ocd, I feel so weak. like I cant do anything, not even quit something as stupid as vaping. and I’m scared I cant go on. This is mostly a rant but idk where else to put it, I’m sorry. thanks for reading

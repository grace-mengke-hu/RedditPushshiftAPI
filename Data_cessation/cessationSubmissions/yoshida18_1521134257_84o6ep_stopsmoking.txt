I decided to stop smoking december 2016, relapsed may-july 2017 and am smoke-free since. I just accidentally tobacco

  I am a 24 year old male, started smoking when I was 15. Smoked for 7 years until I decided to stop, the last time I smoked was july 2017 so 9 months free.  I am doing great despite going trought an emotional hell.

  That is the thought part, a friend of mine gave me a joint 3 days ago and today, when I went to smoke it, I realized he mixed up and gave me tobacco.

  I smoked half of the thing until I realized what I was doing and threw the thing on the ground and stomped it.  

  But the damage was done... That was 15 minutes ago, I'm going trought hell right now, the worst time possible for this to happen... and my mind just got so clear, I didn't even know what that was for a while.  It was good. Too good... even 15 minutes later I can still feel it.  I'm scared as fuck right now.

  I'm scared of relapsing again, my mental health is shit right now and I do 6 hours of therapy a week.
 
 I can't believe a stupid mistake will fuck 9 months of hard work.

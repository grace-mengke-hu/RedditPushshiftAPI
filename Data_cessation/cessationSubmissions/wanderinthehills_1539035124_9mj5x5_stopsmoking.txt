I feel I can finally do this

I’ve always read this sub whilst smoking so I know you guys will appreciate this- I never thought it would be me posting about quitting. Ever.
I’ve smoked since I was 14 (nearly 20 years) and a normal day was 10-15 cigarettes. I’m at the end of day 3 now and feel pretty good. I haven’t gone more than a day without one for about 3/4 years I reckon.
Friday night I went out and got really drunk and smoked twice as much as I normally would. I was so ill on Saturday that I couldn’t face a cigarette, then on Sunday I thought, well I’ve gone a whole day I may as well push on.
I’ve downloaded 2 free apps and one has just completely changed the way I see smoking (not sure if I’m allowed to name it). I’ve honestly got the belief in myself that this is it. 
Just wanted to share as although I’m still apprehensive, I’m pretty pleased so far.

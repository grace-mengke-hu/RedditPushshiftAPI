I've been smoking for damned near 30 years. Today is the day I quit.

If I can just get past my usual "routine" during the day, I think I've got this. I did get a vape, though. Is that considered "not smoking" here?

I've been doing it for so long that I keep wanting to reach for one while I'm typing this.

Fuck that, I'm done.

Just smoked my last cigarette ever.

About an hour ago, I finished Allen Carr's book and smoked my last cigarette. I didn't even want to finish the damn thing. 

I started smoking at about 14 and am now 21. Smoking has harmed my life in too many ways to count: worse social life, much less money, and much worse physical and mental health than my peers. I had asthma as a kid with two smoking parents, seriously hated the concept of smoking, but fell into the same trap you all did.

I will never have another cigarette again. I am so stoked for my future!

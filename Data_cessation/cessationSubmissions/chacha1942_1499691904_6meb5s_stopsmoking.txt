It's Monday and time to get after it!!

Im pumped to start the week!! 

My body feels relatively similar to the way I've felt the past few days (no noticeable changes) @ over 9 days clean from cigarettes.

In any case, I'm stoked and excited for life. 

I vow that I will not smoke a cigarette today.

Fuck smoking.

9 days.

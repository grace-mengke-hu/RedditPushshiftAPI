Dropping down from 21 mg to 14 mg on the patch - should I just stop with the patch?

Today is my sixth week of not smoking after 21 years at a pack a day (hooray!)

That means I also dropped from a 21mg patch to a 14mg patch, per the instructions.

It is pretty damn rough.  Headaches, irritability, and all the same stuff as when I first stopped (though admittedly a little easier).

I am supposed to drop to 7mg in two weeks.

I am tempted to just suffer through withdrawals and not draw this out.  Wondering if anyone else has done that.  I certainly don't want to mess what I have going up at all, but I also don't want to draw the withdrawals and pain out; I think I'd prefer a blast of discomfort.  

Any stories to share would help.

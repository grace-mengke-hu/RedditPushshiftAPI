How do you curb the oral fixation without gaining weight?

I've never been a smoker but I thought you guys might be able to help. I'm trying to lose weight but have the same oral fixation that I'm sure a lot of you have. I chew pens, pop cough drops and hard candy, etc.

I thought about sugar free hard candy but I heard fake sugar is terrible for you. I get rather bad gas from it too.

I've honestly thought about sucking on a marble all day... Why can't everlasting gob stoppers be real? Any ideas?

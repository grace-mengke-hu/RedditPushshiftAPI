A near-miss this morning.

I passed the 7-11 where I routinely bought my cigarettes. In a flash of panic at the prospect of enduring my workday without them, I made the next u-turn to buy a pack. And then I realized how twisted it was to be THAT panicked about not having something that WILL kill me and turned back around. 

Self-awareness is important, even in small doses.

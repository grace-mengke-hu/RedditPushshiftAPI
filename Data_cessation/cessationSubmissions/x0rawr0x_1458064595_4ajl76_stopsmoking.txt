Holy crap I'm so mad right now.

Not at anything in particular, just mad at everything in life. Everything is winding me up and making me angry. Quit wise, I'm fine. I'm on day seven and managing my cravings. But jeez, I'm so irritable. I just want to shout at everyone and tell them how stupid/lazy they are. Ughhh!

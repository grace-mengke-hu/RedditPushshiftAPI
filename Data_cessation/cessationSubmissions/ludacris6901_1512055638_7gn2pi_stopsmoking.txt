4 month cravings

I'm having a really hard time with the Cravings yesterday and today. For those just starting out you can look at my badge and see that it's been over 4 months for me cold turkey. I want you to understand that the Cravings I'm talking about are not the same Cravings that you go through in the first several days of withdrawal they are more of nostalgic feeling of "hey I want to go enjoy a cigarette or I could really just have one cigarette in my car right now while I'm driving". They are very easy to dismiss versus those first few days of withdrawals but on the other hand they are like every hour and it's just getting annoying to have to keep letting them pass. I really don't know what the point of this post is but I just had to get it off my chest any advice welcome.

I just finished Allen Carr's book.

I got it three days ago, and read 100 pages in the first night. This book has honestly changed my life in ways that I probably don't even realize yet, but I couldn't stop reading it because there is no denying the logic he presents. The one thing that has kept me from quitting is the fear that life will suck without cigarettes, but it won't. The pleasure I have gotten from smoking was never pleasure at all. It was an illusion that the nicotine monster gave me in order to keep me feeding its bottomless stomach. Fuck that. 

I cried while reading the final chapters, smoked my last cigarette, and I don't know if I'm just high off that book or what, but FUCK SMOKING. It's an illusion. If anyone out there hasn't read that book or even heard of it, buy it. It's like $12 on amazon. It will change your life.

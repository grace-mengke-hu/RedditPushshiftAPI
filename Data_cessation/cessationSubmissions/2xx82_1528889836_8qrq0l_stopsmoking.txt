What are you doing with all the money you're saving?

I hit 100 hours this morning! Per the recommendation of the smokefree app I've been setting aside the money I would have spent on cigarettes - $22.61 so far. I've thought of several things but can't decide:

*not setting it aside after all and just letting it melt into the rest of my budget. This would probably be the wisest but I'm a huge budget nerd so the loss of the concrete number as a motivating factor would make me sad

*using it as savings for a BIG tattoo. Sleeves are NOT cheap and I want one. 

* spending it on frivolities as I please. I basically buy nothing aside from groceries and household items because I'm a poorfag. Having a category where I'd feel okay about buying a piece of art, or a gadget, or whatever, would be really nice. 

*investing that $37 a week for nine years, which is how long I smoked. Assuming dismal returns that's about 20k when I'm 37 - a down-payment on a house. 

How are you using all this extra dough?

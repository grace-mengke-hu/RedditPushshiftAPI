Two weeks in finding the psychological addiction much worse than the physical addiction.

I am 20 years old and have been smoking for the past 6 years and so far this is the longest I have ever gone without smoking since starting. I quit cold turkey and expected the physical addiction to be the most difficult part and while those first few days were extremely hard I managed to pull through and had been doing fine until a few days ago when I was at a friends house and everyone went outside for a cigarette I managed to control myself but now i keep trying to convince myself to smoke because of things like the fact that I'm only 20 and I can quit later and because i'll be missing out on lots of things and good times i've had while smoking with other smokers and how I used to smoke tobacco with my weed etc. So does anyone have any tips on how to overcome this and if not thanks for reading I mainly just want to rant because i feel close to breaking.

Just read Allen Carr's book

Earlier today I wrote a post here, which I deleted, about quitting smoking next week. I had a lot of excuses about why I would wait until then, but I wanted to buy the book.

So I went to the store 4 hours ago, and read through the book all at once. Man man man, I was able to smoke that last cigarette at the end of the book, but I had one puff and was done with it.

Today is the day my smokefree life begins. I'm so excited haha.

I can recommend this book to everyone. What a mind changer. Impressive.

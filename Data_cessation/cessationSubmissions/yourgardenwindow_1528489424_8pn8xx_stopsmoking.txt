For people who quit using the patch, I have a question

So I’ve smoked a pack of yellow American spirits every day and have been smoking 8 years. My longest cold turkey quit was 3 months. After that I have tried a lot and could not get past the one week mark. Mostly because I get severe depression during withdrawal and I can’t see the end of the tunnel. I know it’s temporary cause it was gone at the 3 month mark. I started again because I was dealing with some unexpected life issues. But I know how to prevent that now.

ANYWAYS.

I decided to go for the patch. I skipped step 1 and went straight to step 2. It is 14mg. So far I am 6 days without smoking. I feel fine. I crave cigarettes but I feel like I have a choice and they’re not making the choice for me.

My only concern that is kind of stressing me out is going from 14mg to 7mg in 3 weeks.

My question is how bad is that drop in nicotine? I know I’m going to do it. But I don’t want the depression and irritability as it affects my relationships with friends and family a lot.

How do I help my mum quit?

So basically my mum has smoked since she was 14, she's now 54. I struggle with major anxiety and am basically stressed about everything all the time. I've just quit smoking so i'm less concerned about myself dying but can't stop thinking about what could happen to my mum. I don't know how to convince her to quit, as every time I bring it up she gets crazy angry. I know that you can't really convince anyone to quit unless 'they want to do it for themselves', but this is ruining me. I feel like i'm just living in constant fear of the day that she gets cancer. What (if anything) can i do? She's my best friend, I don't want anything to happen to her.

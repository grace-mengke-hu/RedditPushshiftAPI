Increased need to sleep?

I've been without all nicotine for two weeks now. Coffee is another thing that has gone from my life. Now I am enjoying just the progress of better health. Everyday I feel better and better. The only thing that puzzles me is that I sleep a lot more. I feel like all I do is sleep. Is this just my body adjusting to the lack of stimulants? Am I healing and therefore needing the extra rest? Anyway, I feel great, but contemplating sleep a lot (I am very tired).

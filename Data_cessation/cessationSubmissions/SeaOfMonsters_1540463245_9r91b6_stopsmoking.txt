Marijuana?

December 1st is my 5 year quit annivarsary! I'm so proud of myself! I quit cold Turkey. No vape, patch, gum or meds (no two quits are the same, if you have or are using NRT and it works for you that is awesome).

However, within the last couple of months I have started vaping marijuana to help me sleep. I live in a state that has legalized it. I have awful sleep issues my whole life and this works for me. However, I hadn't inhaled any smoke in almost 5 years. I always cough.  But I feel guilty, almost as if I were still smoking because I know that marijuana can cause lung issues. I cough all the time now, not just when I smoke. Am I doing the right thing gf for my body? Without it I can't sleep and otc and hypnotics don't work or cause me bad side effects. So it's kind of a toss up.  Any suggestions?

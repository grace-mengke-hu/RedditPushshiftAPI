Insomnia

A week in but don't feel in great shape. I can't sleep and my cycle is erratic to say the least. Herbal Tea and a run in the evening isnt helping. I was up for 4hrs last night after I lied down unable to fall asleep. Woke up feeling like a groggy mess and for the first time in a week first thought through my head was "I need a coffee and a cigarette"

I hate nicotine and cigarettes for making me this miserable.

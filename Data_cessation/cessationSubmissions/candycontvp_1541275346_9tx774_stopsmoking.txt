non-stop anxiety for five days

So, I'm on day 19 but had a minor relapse 9 days ago. 

I had been doing good, but man, the past five days have been a nightmare, it's just this agonizing anxiety for the last five days. It does not stop. Also sleeping has been nearly imposible. 

I've been with NRT and I haven't change the dose. 

I've tried drinking water, deep breathing, excercise. 

it feels like a cat that's trapped in my chest and is scratching to get out. 

Any tips?

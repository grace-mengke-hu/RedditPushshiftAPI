Had a fight with someone and stormed out for a smoke

*holy shit , I'm so lucky it was a dream , I was dreaming I had a small fight with a classmate in a supermarket and I stormed out for half a cigarette , and while  I was in the dream , I was aware it was a dream and felt like shit.*

*Woke up sweaty from distress but still smoke free*

*Damn you brain , you god damn trickster*

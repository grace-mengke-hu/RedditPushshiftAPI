Been trying for years, this time I'm not trying, I AM quitting...thanks to you!

I spent almost all of last week reading posts here at /r/stopsmoking and trying to convince myself I could attempt this one last time.

Friday of last week I had my last cigarette. 

It wasn't any one thing that really made it click, it was a lot of little things. Seeing the posts here and some of the badges people had earned made me want to be one of those people with that one year badge. The realization that I don't smoke at home and only at work made me want to stop as well. I hate the smell of cigarette smoke but I smoked every day if I wasn't at home. 

It's the little things I suppose. Today is day four and I've had maybe a single craving. This time is different, I can feel it. 

I just wanted to say thank you to all of you.

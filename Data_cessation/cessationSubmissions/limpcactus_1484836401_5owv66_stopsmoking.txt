Five days in, messed it all up. I could really use someone to talk to.

My thoughts are super scattered right now and I don't want to end up doing a wall of text on this post. I mainly just want someone to talk to over PM,  because it feels like there's too many factors to be able to explain them all here in the post. I'd be really grateful for someone to listen and maybe give advice. To help me work up the motivation to start over again. Thank you for reading.

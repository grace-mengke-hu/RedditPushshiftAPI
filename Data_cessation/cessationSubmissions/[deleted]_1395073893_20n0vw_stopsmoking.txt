Day 3 1/2 - The toughest day

Little background - Smoked for 6 six years (1/2 pack day on average). Never smoked that many cigs on weekends (have herb) and had my last smoke Thursday at 2:20 PM EST after finishing Alan Carr's book.

Friday was easy, as was the weekend since I could occupy myself other ways. Today is MUCH MUCH harder.

A. I'm at work, which always makes me want to smoke.
B. It's day 3
C. I just want to do something with my mouth. I'm used to having a lot of gum or mints after smoking, but don't want to mess around with that since I could consider it a substitute. Also have toothpicks, which I know are harmless, but Carr says don't substitute. 

Ahhhhhhhh!!!!! It was so easy, but today's testing me. Just needed to vent and write my thoughts out.

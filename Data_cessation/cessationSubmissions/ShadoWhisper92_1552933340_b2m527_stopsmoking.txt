Does vaping count as stopping?

Hello everyone, I am new here and have had this very stupid thought in my head. Maybe you guys can help me out.
 I have been all proud of myself and all for not smoking cigarettes since like November. I started off with iQOS and dropped that for vaping after a few months. Currently on week 2 of vaping.
The thing is... I can't shake the fact that maybe I didn't stop smoking at all and am just fooling myself in an excuse that I'm quitting when I'm actually not? 
I dramatically decreased my nicotine intake, have had no relapses since the switch to iQOS and then vaping. Haven't touched a cigarette since, the smell is disgusting and took a drag once just to really grosse myself out, which worked. Deffinately not going back to smokes. Ew... 
But am I just not using a crutch by vaping? That's not quitting is it?

Tl;Dr: Is vaping really quitting or am I just fooling myself into thinking so?

Made it to 4 days smoke free!

New here. Made it to 4 days without smoking at all! Feel more healthy already. Been using nicotine patches to get rid of the cravings. Got one more left before I'm going to go completely without.

Had only been a smoker for about 2 and a half to 3 years (not too sure of when I actually started) so I'm really looking for any advice that you guys/girls can give for dealing with the withdrawal symptoms that are inevitably going to come up.

Any help is much appreciated!

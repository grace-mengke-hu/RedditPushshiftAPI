Slipped up. So disappointed.

So last night was my works Christmas party. The drinks were free all night and flowing and I let my guard down. I smoked. I've decided to acknowledge it was a slip and still continue on my quit. I have felt all throughout today like crap that I smoked. I'm not going to reset my clock as I can't bear feeling like day one again. I think it would actually do me more harm to reset now as it would make me less bothered to continue to quit. I have new goals for 2015 and dreams that I want to achieve and smoking will ruin everything. The addict won this battle but not the war.

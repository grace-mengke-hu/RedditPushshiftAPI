Asking for experience: Quiting while living with smokers in the house?

I've quit several times recently, always same story. And yeah, I'm smoking again. 

I know how smart I am when I'm on a 2-day smoke-free streak. I know there are cigs in the house. It's MY house, so I know all the secret little places. I always find the cigarettes, smoke, feel bad, promise to quit again... 

Honestly, my wife said she'd quit with me this time but I'd be dumb to ignore the history. So, let's say we do eventually quit smoking. How do I stay smoke-free IF or rather when she starts smoking again?

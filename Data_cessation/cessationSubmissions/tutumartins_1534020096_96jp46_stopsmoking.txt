Almost day 14 - Memory and mood

Hey! I’m hitting the 14th day mark soon. Some context: I’m 26, smoked a pack for the last 10 years. Quit cold turkey. 2nd attempt. Last I’ve paused for 11 months, with cheats.

Lately the cravings are getting easier to fight and less frequent but:

- Short term memory is totally messed up. Yesterday I forgot my car keys at the drivers door, 

- Today Forgot my wallet at home. My partner even said “but you never forget your wallet!”. Yes, I never did.

- I just can’t sit and study. And I’ve used to be a daily learner. Don’t know what’s happening. Maybe attention span it’s messed up too lol. 

- Mood it’s getting back to normal. If you’re having mood swings, eg. fury, anger, or being agressive overall, I sugest to cut caffeine intake. I just did and it’s helping a lot. 

- Coughing a lot. Specially in the middle of the night while I’m sleeping. Some said it’s normal. It’s a really persistent and deep coughing. 


Apart from the above, I’m feeling good. It’s nice to have my energy back. One of the reasons that made me stop was the feeling of have no energy. I’m 26 but was feeling like dead. Now that’s changing!

Anyway, keep going strong! It’s getting easy!

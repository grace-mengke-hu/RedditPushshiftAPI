All The Stupid Stuff we Used to Do because of Smoking.

I'm new here.  I found this place by accident.   I'd like to see if I can help a few of you. 

Think about all the stupid things you don't do anymore because you quit smoking.   And all the stupid things you won't do anymore because you're quitting.  

You no longer:

--go out at 3 am to get cigs.

--spend your last $6 on cigs instead of lunch.  Because at that craving moment you'd rather smoke than eat. 

--go out in a blinding snowstorm to get cigs.  

--stop in shitty parts of town to buy cigs.   

--pick up cigarette butts out of your ashtrays at home to smoke them because you're out of cigs.  

--bother your friends bumming smokes off of them when you don't have any.

--get pissed off at friends who bum cigs off you at the bar, who "aren't really smokers" or are "social smokers".

--Freak out because you can't find your cig pack and you left it in the car/at the office/in your coat pocket at Aunt Lillie's house.

--try to hide your smoking because of embarrassment.

--have to leave a social gathering for 5 minutes to smoke.

--space out during an important work meeting because you're jonesing and all you can think about is when this is going to be over because you really need a smoke.

--wake up hacking up your lungs.

--wake up with pounding headaches because of oxygen deprivation.

--go home early from work to sleep off your "smoking headache".

--get sick with bronchitis 6 times a year.

--waste money on cigarettes.  (A pack a day addiction is $7 a day, $50 a week, $200 a month, $2400 a year.)

--stand outside in a blizzard or thunderstorm, huddled under an office door overhang in your overcoat in 25 degree weather or a hard rain, because you just HAVE to have your smoke RIGHT NOW.   And do that 8 times a day at work.  

Think of all that stupid stuff you won't do anymore, or don't do anymore. 

Can anyone think of any more stupid stuff you did?  Comments?

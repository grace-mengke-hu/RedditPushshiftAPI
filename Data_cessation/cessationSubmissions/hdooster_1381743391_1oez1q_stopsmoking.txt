Epilepsy meds and 1st month incoming

Almost at the first month mark.  
It's worrying as I'm starting to get cocky about it, because it hasn't been hard. I don't care that right now there's a pack and a lighter next my girlfriend's laptop, and I'm here all alone. But the second I *do* I'll be in a volatile situation. I'm 'setting the cat with the milk' as is the expression in Dutch.  
Dreams of relapse this night scared the shit out of me. The whole 'I can handle one cigarette, just for old time's sake'. Really relieved when I woke up :)  
  
I'm wondering *why* this has not been that hard for me. I've quit a month before and it was frustrating. I could see each orange filter lying on the ground from a mile away, taunting me to light one up. Not this time; I can go out and drink 'till 7AM and be okay with not smoking.   
  
The difference with last time is that I'm on epilepsy meds now. Any epileptics here who can attest to meds influencing smoking? Anyone who knows about this?

I have a 3 hour drive today, any advice on reducing how much I smoke?

I'm trying to quit now, I'm reducing the amount I smoke per day. Right now, I've managed to move from a pack a day to about 8 on average. I've been at it since Sunday and I feel I've made improvements but I haven't had to make any long drives until today! Any advice??

Edit: I'm about to hit the road, really appreciate you guys responding. I'll update you when I'm done driving!

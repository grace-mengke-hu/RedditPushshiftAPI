Over a month now and I feel normal(ish) - Thank You to this Sub - Mad Love to you all

Man, I had bad anxiety (never happened before), and I felt like complete crap for the first week like I was dying. I thought I was losing my shit, but now I am getting back to feeling normal again. Only thing is I still have a bit of phlegm in my throat, but I guess it is a small price to pay for 10 years of stupidity. Anyone else feel depressed and like crap during the first few weeks. Honestly, the time has gone so slowly. This sub helped a lot - never gone this long and hearing from all of you guys is great.

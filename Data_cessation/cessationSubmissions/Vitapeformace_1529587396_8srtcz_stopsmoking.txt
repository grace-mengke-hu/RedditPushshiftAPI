Withdrawal symptoms

I haven't smoked for few days now, but I'm little bit worried about my symptoms. I'm have some pain in legs and arms, which worry me. I had similar pain few weeks ago as well. I'm little bit worried that I might have Buerger's disease. Are these pain spikes withdrawal symptoms from smoking?

Day 97 Anyone with GERD

I tapered down to the 7mg nicotine patch but am still chewing the 2mg gum. I live in group home so my gum is administered to me. There are strict rules about and Im not allowed to have more than 8 pieces a day. Honestly I think the gum alone is enough to quit but I got a 7mg patch on. I will probably be feeling the difference from the 14mg patch to the 7mg. I will keep you guys updated as the day progresses. Side note my therapist is an ex-smoker and ran smoking cessation groups a while back. He said to imagine all the bad times you had smoking and not the good times you had smoking. For me its easy because I have GERD and would frequently vomit after smoking a cigarette. I think of that anytime I get a craving. The vomiting has lessened a lot from when I stopped smoking which is good but I am still vomiting once a week which sucks and cant drink hot coffee.

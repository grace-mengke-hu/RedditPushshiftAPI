12 days in cold turkey... How do I stop the withdrawal sweats?

It gets easier every day, but I'm still waking up in pools of my own sweat and coughing up gunk from my lungs. I can't use any cessation products like a patch, vaping, or gum because I need my urine to test negative for nicotine and any chemicals associated with it for a surgery clearance (bariatric sleeve). Does anyone have any tips? I'm sleeping with an air conditioner on and a ceiling fan over me and I still feel like I'm sitting in a rainforest with how gross I feel while I am laying down, doing day to day tasks and just waking up. I took a shower yesterday and less than two hours later I felt like I hadn't showered in a week. Can someone give me some advice or tips?

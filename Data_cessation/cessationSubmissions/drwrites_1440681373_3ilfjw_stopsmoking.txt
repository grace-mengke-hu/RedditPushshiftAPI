when to quit

So, I'm 28 years old, (about to turn 29 in October), and I have been smoking regularly since I was 15. For the past few years, I've been feeling myself become sluggish. I've been gaining weight. I get winded easily. I smell disgusting. My breath is horrendous sometimes. And I'm wasting money. And despite all of that, I am STILL smoking at least a pack a day. 

I know I need to quit. This has been a long time coming. I've tried Chantix, I've tried the patch, and I've gotten about halfway through Allen Carr's book. 

I know I need to just bite the bullet and do it. 

I moved to Washington, D.C., a few weeks ago, and I told myself prior to the move that I would do everything to become smoke-free when I arrived. 

Any advice? Any words of encouragement? What have y'all done to help in your efforts to quit smoking?

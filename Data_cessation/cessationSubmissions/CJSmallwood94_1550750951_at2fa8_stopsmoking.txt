Had a dream that I smoked last night...

It's been almost 15 days, and I had a dream last night that I smoked, and I woke up joyous that I hadn't given in.

Perhaps this was the little nictotine monster panicking that he will die and trying to persuade me to smoke through my dreams?

Let's continue not smoking everyone!

Last badge reset. I need to make sure I don't succumb to boredom!

Yeah so I relapsed about a month ago, and have reset my badge several times since in an effort to quit. A few things that I hope will help make this the last badge reset.
- One day at a time. Don't worry about tomorrow, focus on getting through today.
-It's not you that wants the cigarette, it's the drug addict. Harsh as that may be to hear, recognizing you are a recovering addict will help you immensely with a successful quit.
-Of course you want that one cigarette, but what you don't want is the inevitable cigarettes that follow it. It's not worth it! 
-Research, apps, and this subreddit are incredibly helpful. It's something to read when your mind is glorifying cigarettes that make them sound less appealing. whyquit.com is great, as well as the smoke free app.
-There's no excuses. There is never a good reason to have another cigarette which inevitably leads to relapsing. 
Good luck to anyone else in my position, and keep it up to those who are still staying strong with lots of smokefree time under their belts!

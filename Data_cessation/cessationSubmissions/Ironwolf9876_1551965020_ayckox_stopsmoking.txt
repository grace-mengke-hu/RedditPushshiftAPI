18 years smoking. Ready to quit.

This year I have lost a hundred pounds. my motivation stems from the fact that I need to join a gym to start toning and getting rid of my loose skin but I can't afford a membership and to continue smoking. 
My quit date is April 1st. I am really nervous though. My wife still smokes add this will be the third time I try to quit. I'm hoping the exercise (running 5k every other day + lifting on off days) and the continued weight loss helps me become a quitter for good this time. Any motivation and tips you guys could give me would really be beneficial at this point. 

Thanks!

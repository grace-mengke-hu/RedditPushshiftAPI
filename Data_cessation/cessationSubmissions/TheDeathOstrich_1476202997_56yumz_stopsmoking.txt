Today is the day

I've been smoking 20-40 cigarettes a day since I was about 13 and I'll be 27 in a month. I plan on celebrating not only my birthday but also 1 month free from cigarettes. I've had a million half assed attempts that only lasted a matter of hours and 1 quit that lasted for 3 days. This time is the last time. I'm so sick of spending all of my time and money on the right to feel like shit. I used to love being active and being outside. I was always skating, jogging, and riding my bike but now I can't even walk to the fucking mailbox without getting winded. I'm done with this shit. I want to be able to breathe again. I just finished Easy Way for the second time and have been spending a lot of time on both this sub and whyquit.com and I'm ready to do this. I will not smoke today.

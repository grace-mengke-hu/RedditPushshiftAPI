I fucking smoked and I was furious

I have been having a hard time with my quit lately and have been feeling very depressed. Struggling with feelings of worth and pain and if it was worth it.

I felt myself suck down a cigarette as fast and strongly as I could. Hating myself and being filled with anger the entire time.

But then I woke up from my dream, I was so happy it was a dream.
 
This has been a scary reminder at how awful the addiction is and how much I DONT want to go back to this damn cancer sticks.

I don't want to be a slave to them ever again.

Thank you to this amazing sub for all your support. I wouldn't have done it without you, or you, or you, and especially YOU. Thank you guys :)

I Kicked Some Serious Ass Today

Two months in to my Quit. Seriously, it feels like it's been forever, and it's only 2 months. New Job Stress combined with caring for my elderly father. I want SO BADLY to take a big ole deep lung full of cigarette poison. SO BADLY! i don't even know how i drove past all those nic vendors on the way home from work, but i did it.

i called my daughter for back-up when i got home and begged her for help. (backstory: she quit nic over a year ago and is my hero!) she helped put everything in perspective: NOTHING!, not my elderly dad's failing situation, nor the increasing stress of my new job... none of these things are going to be improved in any way if i decide to burn one.

i am somehow (for the time being) past the thing that made me want to take a great big breath of Bad Things.

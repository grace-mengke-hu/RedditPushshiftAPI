WALL OF TEXT WARNING!

I've been a smoker for about a year now. I started with a cigar on my birthday, and social smoking at parties, bumming a few cigarettes here and there. Then I started to buy packs "for when I went out." Bullshit excuse. I'd smoke it in a day and a half and buy another. Sunday - Saturday. I probably smoked close to a pack a day right off the bat. Over the summer I got into a bad financial situation with the amount that I smoked. I switched to rolling my own in an effort to keep costs down. It worked. But I smoked more.

I have made several concerted efforts to quit, the longest being about a month and a half. But the second I got back to school, I picked it up again. Smoked most of a pack in about 4 hours.

I'm trying to quit again because I recognize that it is affecting my health, most of my friends have quit, and my girlfriend has really pushed me to quit. I want to quit. But the headaches, and the ritual of smoking, and the fear that I'm going to lose a part of "who I am" (stupid shit, I know) keep preventing me. I need help.

I've been weaning myself off of it as quickly as I can, but I'm still smoking 4-6 cigarettes a day if I can bum that many. 

I appreciate your mentor-ship and guidance r/stopsmoking.

Not one puff, no matter what.

I have an addictive personality. On top of that, most of my friends are smokers.  Recently I've decided to quit smoking (for the 20th time..), and it's been 24 days. Beside not smoking, I have been trying to be overall more healthy, by exercising, and cooking healthier food/ not going out to eat as much. I have looked at what kind of exercising i prefer to do, and have written down realistic weekly goals (for example: yoga 3/wk, surfing 1/wk, bike ride 1/wk). I got an app called smoke free, which tracks everything from how many cigarettes you haven't smoked on average since you quit/how much money you are saving, etc...it also has a daily mission, and a recurring mantra which is "not one puff, no matter what".  I am surrounded by smokers/coffee and alcohol drinkers, and have been smoking (cigarettes and weed) on and off (mostly on) for about 8 years.  I am now 25 years old and realize i need to make a strong effort to quit smoking for good.  Every time i have my morning coffee, or go out for drinks, or finish a meal, i have a craving for a cigarette. But for me, after going 24 days, i feel sooooo much better, mentally and physically, and will continue to fight the urge to smoke.  Good luck!

I think I underestimated how hard this was going to be.

I didn’t envision quitting being anything like this. I’m mentally, emotionally, and physically drained. It feels like all of my mental energy is focused on quitting smoking, resisting cravings, negotiating exceptions, and then dismantling those exceptions and pushing through. 
Since I’ve quit, the depression and anxiety have been a great burden. 
I’m 12 days without a cigarette, 4 days without nicotine of any kind. Does/did anyone else feel absolutely exhausted from their quit?

Two weeks since last tobacco product, nine days since last nicotine fix.

No one close enough to me in my present life to show enthusiasm or care towards my progress.... Then again i'm a grown ass man, who else would care for me but myself? 

I decided if the time ever came when I had a chance to give my life more meaning, I better display the perfect image. Perhaps quitting will improve my health so I can have plenty more years of disappointment. 

It's good throwing these thoughts out there. Thanks for the stories though... Highly relatable.

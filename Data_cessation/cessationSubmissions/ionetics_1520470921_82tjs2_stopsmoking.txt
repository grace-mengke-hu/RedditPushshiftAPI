Isn't it weird how stressful smoking was?

Some of the most stressful experiences in my entire old-fart life have been when missing my next dose of poison. Agonising 12-hr flights followed by the desperate rush outside for two fetid gasps on a cancer stick, then back to just make the connecting torture flight. Rinsed and repeated over decades. Truly bizarre, when I could've just said years ago "Fuck this for a game of soldiers" and packed it in!

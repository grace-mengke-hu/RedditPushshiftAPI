Day 5, some more musings...

so day 4 ended up being a lot like day 3. Day 5 is OK so far. The worst part so far are the few hours right after work. I have no idea why. But then it just goes away.


Anyway. I've been smoking for about 18 years. Mostly about a pack a day, sometimes more, rarely less. It's getting easier every day.

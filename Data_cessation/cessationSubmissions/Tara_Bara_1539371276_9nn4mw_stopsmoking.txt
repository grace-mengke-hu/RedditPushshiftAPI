It's been a rough 2 days

Today is Day 13 of a cold-turkey quit. Everything was going swell until yesterday, when I had an emotional meltdown at work over seemingly nothing and had to go home early (my boss is very cool). Today was a repeat of yesterday. 

I was going to workout after work, but I decided to just go home, relax, make whatever I want for dinner, and take care of myself instead (not saying exercise ISN'T taking care of myself, but I really don't want to do it today). I have to work late anyways.

Not sure why I'm telling you all this, I just need to get it out there. This crying-for-no-reason business is no joke, and I hope it goes away. I just want to make it through this day without smoking, because it has been by far the hardest yet.

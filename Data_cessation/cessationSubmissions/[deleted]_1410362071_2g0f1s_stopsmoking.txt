4 Days in, 0 temptation!

Its been 4 days... My nose is clogged, my hands are shaky and many others signs that my body misses that shit. Luckily, I don't.

Yesterday I walked through our house a couple times 'cause I was doing some house chores... I walked past a pack of Marlboro 20s (mom's) like 5 times, and not even once did I think "well maybe I should have one". Not even once. I'm proud of myself!

I know if I was still a smoker it would've taken me much longer to do these house chores just because I'd smoke a cig between each.

Stay strong everyone! and healthy!!

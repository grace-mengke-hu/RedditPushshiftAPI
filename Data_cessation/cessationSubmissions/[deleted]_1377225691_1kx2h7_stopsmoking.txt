How can I help my boyfriend.

Hi guys, 

My boyfriend (M27) quit cold turkey as of yesterday and his taking it really tough, mood swings, headaches, generally being a cunt and it's only the first day! 

Now, my boyfriend has quit before, we both have but when he has quit in the past its been a result of being sick, a few months ago we copped bronchitis so that enabled us to quit without copping the horrible cravings. 

My question is, what can I do to help him deal with this constant moody-ness and just overall being a cynical asshole, we're meant to be going to the cinemas tonight...  I'm not sure if it's wise for him to be sitting down for a constant 2+ hours...  Thanks in advance! 

P.s apologies for any grammatical errors, on my phone. :)

I cheated but I am not giving up!!!

This past week I've had 1 then a couple days later I had 3 then last night I had 5. This morning I woke up, lit a cigarette, smoked it  then went and flushed a full pack DOWN THE TOILET!!! I am not going back. Champix got me 3 weeks smoke free and I am not going to throw this opportunity out the window. I am posting this to hold myself accountable. I do not want to be a smoker. I smoked for 15 years, lost a friend to cancer and will soon be loosing another one. I want to be healthy and treat myself right. 

I am not going to re-set my badge. I consider myself a non-smoker who slipped. Ready to face the cravings that I know I will have over the next couple of days. Appreciate all the support this forum gives!! Looking forward to a smoke free day! Happy Sunday everybody!

Why did alcohol make me fail?

Hey, current smoker here. I'm currently waiting for a better time in my life to try again (a time when I'm not depressed, lost and less concerned by life choices and money). In fact, I feel that I need to stop but I don't even want to

Two years ago I stopped for 2 months thanks to Carr's method (which doesn't work for me anymore, I'm not able to trust what he says after failing so many times), everything was going really really fine, but I went drinking with a friend and I was asking anyone to give me a cigarette for no reason. I could finally get one in the middle of the night, it tasted gross, but it was a relief. Next thing I know, 2 weeks later I'm back to smoking daily.

How does that happen? How someone who's happy about quitting and bragging about it to everyone for 2 months can just childishly ask for a cigarette for no reason while drunk?

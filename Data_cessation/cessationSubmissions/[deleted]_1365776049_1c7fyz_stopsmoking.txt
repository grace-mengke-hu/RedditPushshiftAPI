A permanent state of relapse?

I haven't seen anyone else discussing a quitting holding pattern.  

Basically, I decided to quit two months ago, but I repeatedly go cold turkey for about a week,  buy a pack, smoke half, destroy the rest of the pack and then reaffirm my dedication to quit.

So, over the last couple of months I've NOT smoked about 1200 cigarettes, but I HAVE smoked about 100.  The weird part is I am not tormented during the non-smoking days - I barely think about cigarettes.  I might have two or three strong urges to buy a pack, but they are easy to ignore and/or distract myself from.

While I feel good about the cigarettes I've avoided, I'm getting super frustrated by my inability to go longer than a week (my longest cold turkey stretch was ten days).  I feel like I'm stagnating and destroying a lot of the benefits of quitting by reintroducing nicotine once it's completely left my body.

I'm wondering if anyone else has (or has had) this problem.  If so, how did you get past it?

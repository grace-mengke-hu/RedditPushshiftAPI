Slipping on the patch

Hey guys. Noob here. I had quit for four months on the patch and recently slipped up at a beach retreat with some friends. Over the past two weeks I have had two packs. Used to be a pack a day. The good weather and drinking is not helping. 

Also I wanted to say the patch works really well for me, but I never finish the program. I go good for about four weeks then start forgetting then don't buy the next step. 

I have made it exactly this far three times. How do I get back on track rather than saying fuck it for the next eight months?

Started smoking again...10 years this summer

I don't know what the hell is going on but I started sneaking puffs for the first time in 10 years. Was smoking a pack a day for 15 years before that. I think with our first child who's 2.5 requires some kind of relief at the end of the day ala 9pm. I was drinking more instead but didn't want to keep that up so now I'm puffing.

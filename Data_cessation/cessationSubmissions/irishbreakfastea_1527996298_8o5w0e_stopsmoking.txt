I need to do this-it's been a wild ride so far

Well, i've been stopping, starting, stopping, and starting for 4 months now.  One day here, four days there, even a week and a half.  Throwing so many packs of cigarettes down the toilet in frustration, only to be bumming one 5 hours later from my Dad.  I'm sick of this round and round cycle.  I'm quitting today.  I have a ton of nicotine gum, which I have found helps.  But I need to use it consistently.  More important than the gum, I need to truly accept being a nonsmoker- and that means no smoking whatsoever.  No excuses.  No "one last times".  No "just this time because".   That's been my downfall.  I am sick of going 4 hours, 4 days, whatever and then going back.  I need to stop.  Here I go guys.  I'm not going to ask anyone to wish me luck.  This is on me.  I've done it before and I can do it again.  

Thanks for all the support

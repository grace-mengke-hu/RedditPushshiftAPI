Two Hundred Days of Advice

I never thought I was going to quit. Started pack a day at 16, quit that habit at 23. In the past two hundred days, not only have I quit cigarettes forever; I am soooooo much happier with life. 

If I can do it anyone can, I tried every possible avenue including chantix to quit with no relief. I decided one night at 3 a.m. when trying to buy a pack without an ID that this was it, woke up the next day a non-smoker. It's hard for three days, but that fourth morning after quitting is like a clear blue sky opened up from a lifelong thunderstorm of addiction. 

One day of hell, one week of temptation, one month of new habits, and now I'm on my way to one year. 

Those thunderstorms left me, I am relaxed now. New job starting soon, school is overloaded but great, and a healthy body.

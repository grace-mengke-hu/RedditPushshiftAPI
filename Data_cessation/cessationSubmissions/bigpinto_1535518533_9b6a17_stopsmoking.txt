Life Insurance Medial Exam

I applied for life insurance 10 months after quitting smoking. Now they want to take a medical exam (blood and urine sample). I told them I have never smoked in my life. I figure after 10 months there is no way to tell that I smoked for 25 years unless they cut open my lungs. LOL.

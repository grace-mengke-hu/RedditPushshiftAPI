Has anyone experienced a decrease in libido after quitting?

I could go on and on about how fucking fantastic I feel after quitting. My head is clearer, my breathing is less labored, I have WAY more energy... I feel great...

However, for the past few weeks, my libido has crashed and burned. It started maybe... 2 or 3 days after I quit. I chalked it up to quitting at the time, but now I'm going on 3 weeks and the desire to have sex is just not there. At all. I should add that I am 30/female, and I would say I have an above average appetite for sex. 

Is it just me? Is this normal or should I talk to my doctor? 

Thanks!

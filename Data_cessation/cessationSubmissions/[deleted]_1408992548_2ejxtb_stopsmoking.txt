The longest I have ever gone without a cigarette in five years started yesterday!!!!

So I have quit for over two weeks now and not even thinking about cigarettes any more. They smell disgusting, I hate being around cigarette smoke/smell, and I hate the smell when somebody has just had a cigarette. Slowly I am taking my friends with me down this path of quitting and two are actively trying now. I have completely disassociated myself with smoking and no longer find myself in places where I could relapse. I am still addicted to nicotine as I have just bought a new vape actually. Although two weeks ago I was at 18mg, last week was 12mg, and this week is 6-8mg. I have only quit twice and the first time I quit for two weeks exactly. This was just because I was 16 on vacation with my family and could not smoke, and was not really willful. I was just talking to my friend yesterday about all the benefits I am seeing from quitting. I can smell EVERYTHING, I can walk/run without loosing my breath, I can taste everything, I feel better, and have tons more energy. The worst to come is quitting nicotine all together, I can tell it will be hard. But I am sure not picking up another cigarette again any time soon. I will report back when I quit nicotine because that shit is going to suck and probably will be a risky time to possibly relapse.

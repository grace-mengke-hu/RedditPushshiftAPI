It started with a 10 minute head rush. Woke up and it's been 4 years, or all of my precious teenage years. Holy hell, I'm quitting yesterday.

Title explains it. Tried these shitty death traps at 17 because I wanted to see what the fuss was about. Ooooh, they're illegal to smoke, better try it out. 1/2 pack/day on average for 4 YEARS and I'm feeling like shit. I'm overweight, have high cholesterol, and can barely breathe. Missed out on much of 17-21 year old things due to smoking.

Can't live in the past, can only improve the future. One thing at a time, this month I will quit smoking.

A Different Mentality of Quitting

I recently recalled a story Jim Rome told on his radio show years back and now that I am a non smoker it resonated with me.

He was in college and smoking Marlboro Red's or "heaters" as he referred them, and his roommate at the time told him to quit that nasty stuff. When Rome declared it's tough as hell to quit, his roommate said
 
"If you can't quit smoking, you CAN'T do anything." 

I know a lot times we remove the apostrophe t's in this statement, and it may sound pompous but I also find it to be motivating because it strengthens the mentality that you are bigger, better and more bad ass than the nicotine monster. It also provides confidence through the quitting process and makes you feel weak if you fault, which is why it may help certain people.

Hope this can help anyone out there and I will say after 36 days, I feel fucking great.

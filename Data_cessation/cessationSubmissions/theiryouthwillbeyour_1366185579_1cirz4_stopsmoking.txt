I'm Done

That's it.  Smoking has done nothing good for me at all.  It's starting to really cost me a pretty penny which can go towards paying shit off and buying fancy new toys.  I've only been smoking for two years but I can see what it's done to me and what it has done to my family previously.

I saw this subreddit a couple months ago when I was clicking random and breezed right on through after reading a couple very inspiring stories.  Wish me luck guys!

Third times the charm.... hopefully

I have been smoking for about 2 years now, and I'm that time I have tried to quit cold turkey twice. They both lasted under a month before I relapsed while drunk. It wasn't trying to kick it again until my roommate said that he was tired of me sneaking away every night to smoke (he hates the smell). I have decided to try to quit by slowly lowering my daily use until i am under 3 per day, then quit. Does anyone have any advice to do this?

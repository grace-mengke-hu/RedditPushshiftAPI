Day 3 no smoking!

Third day without a cigarette! 4th time trying to quit and i know i will this time! thanks to who has mentioned in this group how helpful it is to think of it as a past tense like “i don’t do that anymore(smoke)” and “i’m not a smoker anymore” instead of just “trying to quit”. i don’t know why that’s helpful but i keep repeating that and it’s getting me through the withdrawal!!

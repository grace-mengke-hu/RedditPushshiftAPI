Day 24 - going strong

This is awesome.  Still feeling strong.  Smelling smokers on the street is giving me the dry heaves - wow I used to smell like THAT?  My stop smoking app tells me I've saved Â£223.77 so far not smoking 500 cigs.  Today I found a gorgeous cashmere coat in the sales.  Normally I'd admire it and move on - well today I treated myself by way of victory celebration.  Loving having this extra cash!

Bam! 90 Days.

Welp I made it 90 days.  Not gonna lie in those 90 days I had 4 cigarettes 2 on thanksgiving and 2 during christmas.  Its a deal with my wife.  I like smoking she hates it.  So I quit.   Gotta say its gotten a hell of a lot easier.  After smoking around a pack a day for ~4 years I no longer crave.  Wish my throat would bounce back faster but I'm doing great.  

As for smoking the cigarettes during the holidaysâ€¦ it was nice.  The next couple days I had a little bit of craving but totally manageable.  To all the people working on their new years resolution.  I don't recommend smoking after ur quit date especially within the first month.  However it gets really easy to just forget it. So thank you guys for all the support and stay awesome.

4 weeks today!


Other than a couple of irritable afternoons and groggy mornings, I'd say the quit has been pretty easy going. I haven't missed smoking outside of random cravings that pass quickly.

Some things that have helped:

1) refusing to pity myself/ excuse bad behavior "because quitting"
2) treating discomfort as a sign of healing
3) checking smoke free app and this sub when cravings come
4) lots of water
5) naps in the first week

Some benefits so far...
1) enough cash for a new-to-me phone
2) I smell amazing and clothes don't have to be over washed after a half day wear
3) I fall asleep easier
4) I'm less stressed in general (3 weeks without nail biting!)

A couple downsides/ things to manage:
1) I still haven't figured how to get past the after lunch crash
2) I'm gassy... a lot
3) acne out of nowhere 


I hope you are all having amazing, smoke free days. For the uncommitted lurkers- go for it! It may be the best thing you ever do for yourself!!

I’ve made it 14 days today. It feels so freeing! I’m still figuring out how to fill my time occasionally. Usually in the evening when I would subconsciously chain smoke until bedtime. Everything else has been super manageable! 
My smell and taste are definitely improved. I wake up with more energy in the mornings than I ever have, and I don’t have to be stressed all day wondering who can smell me, or who can see me smoking, or who saw me sneak out of work for a smoke break... and most of all, I don’t have to think of the disappointing looks on my mom and grandmothers faces. 
I lost my grandma to lung cancer 3 years ago, and I lost my mom to it in April. To be 28 years old and the oldest member of my family living is a very hard pill to swallow, and I’m still pulling myself through, but I will not leave my family that way, and I won’t live my life avoiding social situations because I can’t smoke, and pretending it makes me happy.
I am a non-smoker, and I’m so fucking excited to say that!! I can only imagine the smiles on mom and grandmas faces now!

3 Months!

Can't believe it.. it's already a quarter of a year!


Going smoke-free into next year will be the greatest Christmas-present ever! ... I don't wanna gloat, but watching my friends roll cigarettes out there in the cold with shaking hands feels kinda nice... I am a bad person sometimes, haha ;) 


In 9 days, I'll have a 100 days already :O ... Saved over 2000 cigs.. that's a SHITTON of money, holy cow...! 


Happy Holidays!

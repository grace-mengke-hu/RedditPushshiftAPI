Smoking while drinking was my last obstacle and I think I can conquer it!

Today is my 3 weeks of not smoking. Despite my extreme anxiety and many days and moments where I just wanted to throw in the towel and be like, "whatever, you can quit when you're in a better headspace" or whatever excuse I wanted to use, I have not smoked at all! 

The one thing that ALWAYS seems to ruin my quitting efforts, though, is drinking. Especially drinking in social environments (bars, barbecues, etc). This last weekend I went to a bar twice and I only had the urge to smoke one or two times, and it wasn't even that strong of an urge. I am so happy!! This was my greatest obstacle by far and I feel like, for the first time ever, I am able to control myself when I have an alcoholic beverage. 

Anyway, this subreddit has been a tremendous help to quit smoking. I didn't know what to expect when I visited here, but it has been awesome and helped me so much. Thanks everyone!

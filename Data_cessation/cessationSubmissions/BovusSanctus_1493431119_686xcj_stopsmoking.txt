Quitting tomorrow

So I'm quitting tomorrow. Finally. I don't know if my badge still shows it, but I've quit before and failed.  
I smoke way too much and I'm sick of it. But I'm also scared. Last time the cravings were really tough and I made the silly mistake of rewarding my good behaviour with, you guessed it, a smoke. None of that is going to happen now.  
I've browsed through this sub a bit tonight and I love the positive comments and tips here. I will try to clean up stuff when I get a craving, which is a great tip I read here, both for dealing with the cravings and for the state of my apartment. Tomorrow afternoon I will visit a friend who knows I am quitting and we will clean out her shed, then order food and watch a movie together. I hope I will be able to enjoy it.  
I will now put away all the smoking gear so I won't see it tomorrow morning. I have two weeks off from work, so at least I won't be triggered by my routine there. I hope I will be strong enough after those two weeks to keep going.

Lies, damn lies, and goddamn lies

My brain is lying to me. It's telling me life is so much better as a smoker. One smoke is just a little setback. You can always resume quitting right after. Do you really want to live life always in withdrawal like this? Lies. Lies. Lies. Must be day 2 of quitting. I'm good.

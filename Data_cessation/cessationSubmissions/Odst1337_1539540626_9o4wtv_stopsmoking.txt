Swishers

Hi I’m trying to ween myself off tobacco so I’ll never smoke again but I can’t do cold turkey, I have an extremely addictive personality and it only took me 2 cigarettes to get hooked and 2 months to start smoking a pack a day, I’ve decided to try only smoking one swisher a day because I heard they’re like 10 cigarettes. Is this true? If not how many cigarettes is one swisher equal to?

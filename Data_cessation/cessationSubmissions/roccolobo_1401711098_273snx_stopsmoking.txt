Day 1...

I've tried stopping ten or twelf times over the course of the last maybe 10 years. I've endured times in which I couldn't really breathe, times in which I was sick because of it, times in which it just hold me back from/while running. Sometimes I was more successful with the quitting and it was good for about 6 months or even a year. Then, one way or the other, there was a cigarette in my life again. But that's the past. My decision in the present will only determine my future. I'm done and worth more than that. It's not doing ANYTHING for me. 

I hope I will not forget about the emotional state I'm currently in. I hope I won't forget the suffering I've endured because of the combination of smoking and pollen allergy. Nights without breathe. Endlessly awake and waiting.

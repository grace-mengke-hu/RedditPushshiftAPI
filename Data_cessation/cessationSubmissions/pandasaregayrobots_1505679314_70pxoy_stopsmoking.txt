My SO ans I started this together, but now he's bought a vape.

I feel like he's found a loophole, because no matter how I feel and what i say society (and he) don't see them as the same thing. I think nicotine is nicotine and since that ans the hand to mouth addiction are what makes smoking so so addicting that they are indeed like the same thing. 


We started about 3 months ago and while there have been hiccups (cigar here and there) for us both I thought we were doing pretty well - until this. 


I don't even know what to do. I need some insight because apparently I'm a psycho girlfriend for thinking that vaping is the same (he buys juice with nicotine in it).

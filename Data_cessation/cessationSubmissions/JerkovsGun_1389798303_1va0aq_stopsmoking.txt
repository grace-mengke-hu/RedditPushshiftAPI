I did it!

I quit about three weeks ago, not through some great feat of willpower and hard work like the rest of you but because I started taking the antidepressant drug Wellbutrin, which actually used to be marketed as a stop smoking pill. 

As it started to work I noticed I went from 10 cigarettes a day to 5, to once every couple days, and then I just didn't give a shit about them. The last time I smoked was NYE, but only because my friends were going out to smoke and I wanted to be sociable. I couldn't even finish that cigarette, it was just unpleasant smoke. Now that I've got the monkey off my back, I am making an actual conscious decision to stay away from cigarettes.

Only downsides are: Drinking on this medication makes me feel like shit (maybe that's an upside?), and I have no way to break up my work routine. I can't get stuck on something and go have a smoke to clear my head. I do kind of miss that rhythm that it gave to the day. But I'll take being able to climb a flight of stairs over that any day. And yes, I already have noticed changes in my general well-being and ability to breathe. 

Again, this one's kind of a "cheat code" here, and I know a lot of you guys have gone through hell to kick the habit, so I don't mean to be smug or anything. Just thought I'd give my experience with this drug.

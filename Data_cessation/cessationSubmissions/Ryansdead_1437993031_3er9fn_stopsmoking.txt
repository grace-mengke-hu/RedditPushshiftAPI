Lets try again (and again and again)

Caved. Emotional stability is in shambles. I think i subconsciously smoke in hopes of dying. I hate cigarettes. I want to quit. Im attempting again.
This time I will continue to be proactive on this sub, use nicotine substitutes like gum/patchs and start changing my smoking behaviorisms by substituting them with something other than a cigarette

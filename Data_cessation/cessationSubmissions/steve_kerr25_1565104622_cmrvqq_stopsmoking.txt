Day 1 All Over Again

I've been an on-and-off smoker for many years, and have had several quit attempts. I've gotten to over 1 year smoke-free three times, but each time I relapsed around 1 year. I've had many more quit attempts not go that long (probably in the hundreds, with the majority being less than 3 days). I've tried the patch, the lozenge, cold turkey, the pills, and all different combinations of those. My latest relapse happened in January of this year and that was after about 7 months smoke free.

I need to quit and I'm starting (again) today. At this point, I experience heartburn on a daily basis. Nicotine lozenges (my main aid the past couple long-lasting quit attempts) make it worse, but smoking also makes it worse. So in light of that, I'm going with the patch this time around. I've got my lozenges on me, but I am going to do my best to avoid them, at least until this heartburn subsides, which usually seems to take only a couple days.

This needs to be done. I don't even enjoy it any more. When I'm smoking, all I'm thinking about is when I can have my next one, and what needs to be done to hide it from the people around me, who eventually figure it out anyway.

I'm glad I found this community. I think the additional support I can get from here will be helpful, where I can pull up an app, read about people's stories, and know that I'm not alone. So I just wanted to say thank you to all of you here, in advance, for the support you provide me. Best of luck to all of you.

Day 2 and going nuts!

Okay so I'm turning 28 this month (started smoking at 12) and have planned to ride to Mongolia in the autumn (+/- 10000 miles). I don't wanna be out of breath and unfit for my trip, as it's going to take some endurance, so I figured I'd quit after all the festivities.

Yesterday was okay, today has been hell and I can't pinpoint why. I quit a couple of times (unsuccessfully) last year, but the first days were always a bit easier than this time. Might be cos I was never convinced I'd actually quit the previous times, so always knew I'd have a ciggie in a few days / weeks / whatever. This time I've forbidden myself from smoking at parties etc. (I didn't before -.-), which makes it seem impossible!

Luckily the boyfriend just went out to buy me chocolate haha!

Anyways, just had to vent :) but I'm curious whether anyone has any tips for the first few days for someone that still smoked like a 19th century chimney a couple of days ago? I've tried nicotine gum and patches before, but they don't work for me.

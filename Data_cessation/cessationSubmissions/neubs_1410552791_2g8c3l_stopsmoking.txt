Getting drunk tonight, this will be the test.

I sprained my knee a week ago tonight walking home from the bar and had been pretty much laying around since then.  I had no cigarettes because I was staying at my parents' house and can't smoke inside.  I wasn't drinking either because the doctor told me to take a bunch of ibuprofen and I really didn't feel like making my stomach bleed.


I'm back at my house now because I can get about on my own decently enough.  The bar is only a block away from my house.  I'll go there and the people who helped me home that night will probably be there so I'll let them know I'm alright since I sort of ghosted on them.  Anyway they all smoke and we'll be on the smoking patio and I'll see if I can resist temptation.  Wish me luck.

Smoke free app missions

These missions really help.  Yesterday on day 14 I was craving really bad all day.  The mission was to imagine tearing up a pack of cigarettes and totally and completely destroying them.  It helped to get mad and imagine destroying what had been destroying me, w how bad I was craving.  Today’s is to take three deep breaths, smile,  and say to yourself “two weeks smoke free”, five time throughout the day.  It helps.  And it feels great to be able to say that.

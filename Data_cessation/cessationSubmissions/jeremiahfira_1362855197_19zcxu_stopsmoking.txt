Am I cheating at all?

So, I quit smoking over 3 months ago. I am also a regular toker. I usually use a bowl to smoke up, but the past 2 weeks, I've been fantasizing a bit about a coffee and a cigarette. Obviously, I don't want to go back on the nicotine train, so I've been rolling lots of joints and going that route. In my mind, I almost feel like this is a loophole. I know that any sort of inhalation of smoke is bad for me, I'm not trying to kid myself in that respect, but I feel like I may be rekindling an habitual thing that could bite me in the butt. Thoughts?

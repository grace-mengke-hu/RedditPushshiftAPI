I just smoked my last ever cigarette

like many of you, I've attempted to quit many times. I've been smoking for about 13 years, and even successfully quit for a year before.  
This time however I've used Allen Car's Easy way as a few threads have recommended, and I can safely say now I have quit with confidence for the first time ever. I'm actually excited that I can now say I'm a non smoker.  
Of course I'm incredibly anxious as well, I've been leaning on cigarettes for so long to 'help' with depression etc but now realise that it only made it worse.  
I just felt like I needed to share it and figured this might be the best place to do so.  
Anyway, thank you all for your help and I'll check back in down the road!

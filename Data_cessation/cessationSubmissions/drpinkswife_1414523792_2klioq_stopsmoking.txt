In Paris

Would totally want to smoke but seem to have food poisoning from lunch yesterday in London. At least this trip was practically free because if I don't get better it will be completely worthless. Paris another trigger. Food poisoning, the cure for smoking. ðŸ˜ž Don't have my laptop with me. Hope everyone is happy and smoke free. 

Dear Brain, I know what you are doing.  Smoking will not make my stomach better and NO I can't just smoke whilst in Paris! Dammit!!!

Still have hard times

Last night I had a big reality check.  Whether it's been 6 days or 6 months, sometimes it's still very hard to not smoke. I had one of those days where work was horrible, my husband and I arguing and an unexpected bill to tie it all together. Of course the FIRST thing my brain thinks.......if only I had a cigg right now.

Thankfully I was able to resist just by crying my eyes out and remembering: even when I smoked, I would have been super stressed.  The cigg would do nothing for the stress, just caused more in the end.

When people tell you that you will always have a craving, no matter how infrequent, they weren't kidding. But you can always come through the other end still a non-smoker. :)

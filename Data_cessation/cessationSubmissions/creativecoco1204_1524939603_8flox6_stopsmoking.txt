Livid, but I’m not gonna smoke

Woke up this morning to a hit and run involving my car. Some idiot rammed my car, doing enough damage that I’ll need to fix it, and left without leaving a note. The bastard! I have evidence of the car (they left behind broken pieces of their car) and am going to walk around my neighborhood looking for a car that I can match the broken pieces to. It’s a long shot as I’m in a big city, but without knowing the other vehicle, I will have to pay for the damage to my vehicle. I wasn’t even in the car! Damn insurance companies! Damn state (USA) for not making it a guideline to cover hit and run accidents. (Who else can I bitch about) grrr...

Obviously, I’m upset, but I’m still NOT gonna smoke. I’ve always been a pretty complacent person. It’s kinda nice to feel my own anger. Still a rough experience, but I’m breathing through it. And venting a bit... Don’t mind me....

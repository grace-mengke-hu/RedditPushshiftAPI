Question for those who have slipped for a day or two

I smoked like two yesterday and three or four today.  I have no excuse and I feel stupid about it.  Is it going to take another extended period of time to lose the cravings and the coughing hairballs?  (generally speaking, of course)  It seems the longer I go, the harder it is for me every time I quit.

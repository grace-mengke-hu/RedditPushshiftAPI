First day, out in Afghanistan and fed up with it.

I was on guard last night, had my last one and that was that. 


Cold Turkey. I have no access to any other way.

 I know it's gonna be a long road but one I have to travel. 

Well I got you lot for company anyways...


Thought better here as I have no access to alcohol and also the dry heat and dust just makes smoking even more abrasive and horrible than ever. I needed to stop and well this is it. So far managed to sleep most of the day away, If only I could do that for the next two weeks! 

So guys, what sort of things can I expect in the coming weeks/months? 

More importantly what health milestones? 

Also does the craving diminish?

Thanks in advance.

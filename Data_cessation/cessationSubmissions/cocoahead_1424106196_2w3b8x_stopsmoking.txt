My first smoking dream

wasn't really a smoking dream at all. I remember in previous quit attempts that I would have these dreams about smoking and feeling terrible about it. I would wake up relieved that it was just a dream but at the same time I would be craving the cigarette that dreaming me got to have. Last night's dream was a lot different...

 I was raging and bitching about something. Not sure what about or to who, but I was digging through my bag for my phone or keys or whatever and came out with a pack of smokes. I continued to rage about whatever had me so upset and then looked in my hand and said "and I don't need these fucking things, either!" and then threw them across the room. That's the last thing I remember before I woke up all giggly :)

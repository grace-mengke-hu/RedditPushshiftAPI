Woah! I got a gold star!

Everything is so tasty, and smells so good!
Othen than my dog, he smells like a roadkill.

I hardly get any cravings - about two a day tops, and they aren't that bad. I'm a nicer, happier and less anxious person. I smell nice. My skin looks amazing. I can walk and climb the stairs with no problem at all.

I admit, I sometimes miss smoking, but that's why I'm going to a booster session at alan carr's center. Thank you, guys. You have been awesome and very supportive.

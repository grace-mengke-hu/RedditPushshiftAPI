Quitting today- currently smoking my last cigarette.

So I’ve been having a lot of trouble breathing and chest pain the last few days. It’s given me so much anxiety because I’ve been a heavy smoker for over 10 years (I’m now 26) and have decided to quit for good. 

Would just like to know what to expect in the next coming days/weeks. I’ve attempted to quit many, many times but never made it more than a few days. I’m also a female if that makes any difference. 

I work a high stress job and am super worried about not having a pack for when I take my lunch today.. any tips, encouragement or first-hand experiences are much appreciated. Thanks!

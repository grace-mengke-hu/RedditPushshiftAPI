One year smoke free today!

Never thought I would get here as I smoked a pack a day for almost 30 years.  I rarely post on this sub, but you folks have been here to inspire and encourage when needed, so thanks for that. No great advice for anyone as each person needs to walk their own path to a smoke free life. Just two days ago I had the briefest thought after dinner about how good a cig would be but it only lasted a second. Still fighting after all this time. Thanks again everyone for all your help this past year and best of luck to those just taking the steps to quit smoking. You can do it!

My last one was yesterday.

I had been smoking for a few years, and quit yesterday. Everything felt fine until I went to throw away my ashtray just now, and I feel overwhelmed with sadness. Why? I feel like i'm losing a relative or something. When in reality I just won't be inhaling toxins anymore.

Why does it feel like this? Does it go away?

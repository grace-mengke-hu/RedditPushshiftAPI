Update: 60 hours grit-free

[I stopped being a lurker here at 43.5 hours](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/18xfby/435_hours_without_a_cig/). So I went home & got drunk as sin last night but abstained from the cigs with the help of my fantastic SO. Lotta trees instead. Took a sip of beer for ever grit craving. I know that I'm in the final stretch of withdrawal now and planned well for this work shift: snacks every 2 hours, including an orange to peel & eat. It's really not as big of a deal as I think it is, but it feels immense after last night. I swear I was craving a cig for 2 hours straight. I hope tonight is not as difficult.

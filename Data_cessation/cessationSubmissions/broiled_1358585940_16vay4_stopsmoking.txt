Date set, wish me luck

I've been smoking for a number years and I'm damned tired of the things. On Monday, the 21st, I plan on quitting. I've quit a few times before, the longest for almost 7 years, but have relapsed under stress.

I've already bought the Nicotine Lozenges, ( I can't use the patch due to being allergic to the glue that's used on them).

Update: 26 hours without any tobacco and haven't even opened the package of lozenges. I actually took the time to read the insert for the lozenges and discovered that they can't be used within 15 minutes of drinking anything. The only time that I don't have coffee or water, right in front of me, is when I'm sleeping.

I can't stop crying!

I quit smoking just over two weeks ago. I have cravings occasionally but I seem to be managing them alright (even with a boyfriend who smokes). I am however crying ALL THE TIME! Little things, big things, whatever it is... I'm crying. Has anyone else ran into this? Could something else be going on?

Been a couple of months and all of a sudden...

Iâ€™m getting stronger urges than before, even stronger than in the beginning. No plan to light up but curious whether others have experienced this. Oh, and sleep pattern is so bad still, hardly sleeping 4-5 hours a night. Other than that, loving everything else about not smoking.

Just reset my badge, don't give up and don't give in! Starting over is no fun :/.

After over 3 months of going cold turkey, I gave in when my uncle passed away and I was having some rough girl problems. I made it to about ~110 days and have been smoking for the last month. But today I'm stopping again, trust me people who are in my shoes you do not want to pick up another one. It's a pretty crappy feeling having done so well to then have everyone around you like "Woah you were doing so well, what happened".  Even without your friends as a constant reminder, you don't need smokes. The worst part about picking up smoking again was that as I was smoking a cigarette I would acknowledge "This is doing nothing for my anxiety/ isn't making me feel better at all"; but despite this, once you start the voice in your head tells you it doesn't matter - you would've failed anyway. And then you have to muster the energy to begin another quit again and it's exhausting some times. 

Anyway thats it, I'm going for it again. Hopefully this will actually be the last time.

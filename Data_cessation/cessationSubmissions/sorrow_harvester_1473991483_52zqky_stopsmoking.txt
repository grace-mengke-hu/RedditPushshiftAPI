Is it weird that I'm hoping I get sick?

Seriously considering going down to Walmart to lick cart handles. I just started my quit plan and I am reducing my cigarette intake by half this week. I am almost wishing to catch a cold because it always makes not smoking easier. If all goes well, October 4th will be my first day tobacco free.

Need reasons not to relapse

I stopped smoking three weeks ago . For the past 2 days I have been thinking about smoking a lot. It is weird because I almost forgot about cigarettes last week, but now my mind is creating the lamest excuses to get me to smoke. Please give me some advice, I don't want to relapse.

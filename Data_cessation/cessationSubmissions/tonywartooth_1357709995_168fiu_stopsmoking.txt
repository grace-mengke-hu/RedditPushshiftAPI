Missed posting on my one month by half an hour.

Like the title says, one month without smoking. I used nicorette for roughly 4-5 days, maybe a couple more when I got drunk at the bar. Living with roommates that smoke all the time, and my 7 year penchant for smoking a pack a bar night, along with my 3 years in car sales (12 hours a day, anything that kills time is your friend), I can honestly say there's no way I could have made it without my incredibly supportive and wonderful girlfriend. Even a support group of one can make the difference if they help you believe in yourself. Good luck gents and dames, and a toast to no more smelllikeshitwhyamicoughingwheredidallmymoneygo.

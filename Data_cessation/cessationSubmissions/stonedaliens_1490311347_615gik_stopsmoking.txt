One week in with a horrible cough :(

I officially stopped smoking 7 days ago, and since then, I've had the nastiest cough and sore throat. I switched from smoking 5-6 cigarettes a day to vaping; the e-juice I have is 12mg of nicotine. It's pretty discouraging to feel so shitty. I feel worse off now than I did before I quit smoking, which almost makes me want to give up. What should I do?

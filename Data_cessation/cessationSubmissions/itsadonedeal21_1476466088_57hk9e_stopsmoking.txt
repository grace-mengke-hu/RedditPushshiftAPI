Finally decided to quit smoking. Day one. Here we go.

Have to admit that thought of quitting is kind of scary. What if I fail? For me, it would mean that I have failed myself. Is that kind of fear common? I guess it could be used as an extra motivator. Nevertheless, here we go. I would appreciate any advice on how to avoid thoughts about going to nearest shop and buying cigs. Thank you! Wish me luck!

Day 8 off to a shitty start

It all started with a dream of my ex wife and there was a lot of stress needless to say in the dream.  For some reason she had moved into the apt that I had not fully moved out of and she had hidden all my stuff and I couldn't find it.

Needless to say I woke up feeling depressed and stressed and all I wanted to do is smoke.  Instead I jumped on FB and went through yesterdays posts and read some crazy things and made some comments on peoples posts.  

I am still here in bed with my 3 cats and still happily smoke free :)

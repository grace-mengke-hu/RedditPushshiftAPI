Quit for 45 days, Slipped up recently and had 4 cigs in the past 3 days.

My girlfriend and I have been out of sync lately. She's a bit of a stress monster and the way she talks to me sometimes makes me feel bossed around. I tried telling her this nicely, and she couldn't deal with the criticism, started crying, it turned into a two day conversation, blah blah. So I bummed a cig off a bartender. Maybe to protest, not sure. It tasted like ass, but I felt better for some reason. The empty feeling that accompanies quitting is really fucking difficult, and I think it makes me hard to be around. I got really depressed on our recent trip to DC. Felt dumb, out of place. Not really like me. Anyway, thanks for reading. I'm going to quit again, but I absolutely fucking hate being irritable and shit.

I smoked my last cigarette today.

Hello all! I've been smoking more than a pack a day for 14 years or so.  Tried to quit a few times.  The most serious lasted about a month.  Then I was on bed rest recovering from a surgery for a week, and thought that I could have a few cigarettes, just to kill the time.  I immediately went back to a pack a day.

Tried an e-cig, but didn't quite cut it (unless I was somewhere that I couldn't have an actual cigarette).  It only held me over until I could have my next cigarette.

Read some posts here and Allen Carr's 'Easy Way' book recently, and decided today was the day. 

Smoked the second to last smoke in the pack around noon, took the last outside and threw it away, along with all of my lighters and my e-cig.  I don't know that it will be easy, but I'm really excited to be a non-smoker!

I don't like the limb numbness and chest pains that I get, or smelling awful all the time.  But the main reason I'm quitting is I am tired of nicotine controlling me. I am choosing to be free of it, starting now.

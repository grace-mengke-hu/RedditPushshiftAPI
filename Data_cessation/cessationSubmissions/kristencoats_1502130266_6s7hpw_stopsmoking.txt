Blessing in disguise- day 20

Thankful that I have gotten to 21 days smoke free! I'm currently starting a new job and my boyfriends check was short a couple of weeks ago so if I were still smoking I wouldn't have been able to pay my rent and I literally wouldn't even be able to buy a pack until Friday, which sends any smoker into panic mode. Now I don't have to go through withdraw because I can't afford it and I got to make the choice to stop myself! It's getting a little easier everyday!

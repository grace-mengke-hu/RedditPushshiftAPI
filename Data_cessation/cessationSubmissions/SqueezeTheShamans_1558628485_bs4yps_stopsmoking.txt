I am finally ready to quit

I'm 21 years old and I have been smoking almost everyday for nearly 6 years. I've been thinking about quitting smoking for a long time now, but thinking about it is one thing, doing it is another. 

I had my last cigarette not too long ago and I said to myself this is it, I won't be touching another smoke again. I'm finally ready to never touch one again, and I'm determined to do it. 

Thought I'd share with this sub, a lot of the posts are inspirational and I applaud each and every one of you. I hope to be posting about my abstaining from nicotine in years to come and supporting all of you as we go through it together!

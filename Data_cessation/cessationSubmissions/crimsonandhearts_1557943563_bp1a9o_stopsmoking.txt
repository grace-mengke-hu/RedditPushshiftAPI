10 months down!

And I’ve saved $2,698. That’s a pack a day in the state of California. Packs (were) $8.75 when I quit. I was spending $60 a week on cigarettes. I feel better than I ever have, I’m down 60lbs, I can breathe walking up stairs now. I’m never ever going back and I hope all of you who are struggling know how worth it it is to just keep going!! Don’t give up on yourself. You’re so much stronger than you even know. Quitting smoking is the hardest mental battle you’ll ever have with yourself and you will feel like a damn warrior when you beat it. I promise. Feeling free is the best feeling ever. You’ve got this.

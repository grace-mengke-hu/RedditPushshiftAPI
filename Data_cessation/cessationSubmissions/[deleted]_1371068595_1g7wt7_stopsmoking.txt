Today is a hard day

I'm struggling really hard today. I feel lost, confused, and just down. I'm having a rough day and I feel so freaking low right now. I cannot bring myself to do anything today. I just want to lay down for the rest of the day. All I keep thinking about right now is how one cigarette will help ease all of this. That I'll feel slightly better with one puff and how it will only keep getting better with each additional drag I take. That's how one part of me feels. The addicted side, it's only to easy to throw away almost a months worth of effort within seconds. 

Then there's one small part of me, that's fighting for my health. That's fighting to stay smoke free. I think about all the effort I've put in. I think about how proud my friends, family, and even coworkers are of how I've been able to quit. They think, 'wow, if this guy could quit then anyone could quit.' So the thought of disappointment and shame is another preventing factor to keep myself from smoking but even with all of that said I truly want to say, FUCK IT and light one up.

Newcomer with 11 days

Hey gang, this is my first time posting here but I drop by every once in a while to read people's success stories.  This is the longest I've been without cigarettes I think since I started, over 10 years ago and I'm starting to feel pretty excited about it.  

I started smoking senior year in high school and I continued casually through college.  Since then I've been a pretty regular half pack a day smoker and I'm 29 now.  There were a lot of alcohol and drugs consumed in that time as well.  I've had pretty severe anxiety and depression for a long time and after college, I slowly started to give up on a lot of my career, relationship, and personal goals.  I became very isolated, overweight, and my depression/anxiety got worst.  I barely worked, have been single for years, and drank and smoked every day.  

I've been slowly digging myself out of that hole and this year things have really been improving.  I am 6 months clean/sober, I exercise regularly, work a full time and part time job, and now, last on the list, I've quit cigarettes!  I read the Allen Carr book about 2 months ago, but I couldn't stop for more than a couple days.  

11 days ago, I had to clean out my basement, which flooded.  I felt so gross at the end of that.  My lungs felt heavy and damp and the thought of a cigarette disgusted me.  I used those thoughts, the lessons from Carr's book, and a smoking app as motivational tools.  My health and financial savings are probably my biggest personal reasons for quitting.  I still have cravings, but nothing like the first week.  I am excited being a non-smoker, but as I write this I worry if I will really be able to stick with it.

Here goes day 1

day one beings today.  The last cig i had was last night at 10:45.  I've been enrolled in a cessation course through my work, it's nice having 4 other people in the same boat as myself.  I've been smoking since the age of 15 socially and a heavy smoker from the age of 18.  i am currently 28.  I will be using the patch and lozenges (as needed).  This is the first time i've used any aids in an attempt to quit.  i also went out last night and bought Alan Carr's book (to read over the weekend and keep me occupied) and some cinnamon sticks (whose anxious...not me lol) i also have some distractions already in place...i've got my silly putty and a bouncy ball, these active things are the only things i've been able to come up with to help distract me plus i'm kind of a kid...i looove bouncy balls and believe me i've tried, it's really hard to play with a bouncy ball with a cigarette in hand :) 

so here's to day 1, may it be fast and swift!

Two weeks and the flowers never smelled better!

I read Allen Carr's Easy Way to Stop Smoking and quit cold turkey two weeks ago as of tonight. It has been an amazing process and surprisingly uplifting knowing how strong I am and that I can destroy my enemy, the cigarette, the little monster! My fear and anxiety about quitting was way worse than actually quitting. Like many things in life, the first step is the hardest. It is nice to know that I am a non-smoker now and for the rest of my life. 

The biggest change that I am in love with and trying to experience as often as I can is the return of my smell and taste! I am smelling every flower with deeper, cleaner whiffs and enjoying the same foods in a whole new light. I can smell things from further away and feel like a hound dog tracking down whatever is entering my nose (for good or bad). I find myself savoring bites of food for longer, really appreciating the complexity of ingredients. The same freaking bubble gum brand that I've been chewing for years, tastes completely new, and I like it! I'm experiencing greater, vivid memories triggered by smell. It is beautiful! 

There are many great benefits to being a non-smoker (like health! and money!), but I have to say my favorite is the renewed gift of taste and smell. I just wanted to share this with future ex-smokers and those that already know what I'm raving about.

Anyone quit while spouse still smoked

We quit smoking november 2016 and its been amazing until (insert excuses here.) 

He started with little cigars and today bought a pack and i broke down and smoked one because i can obviously have just one!! I feel like an idiot as im well aware "just one" does not exist. 

Any advice on how to cope with living with a smoker? And what replacement therapy have you guys relied on? I've turned to food and have packed on the pounds to prove it, unfortunately. Any advice is much appreciated.

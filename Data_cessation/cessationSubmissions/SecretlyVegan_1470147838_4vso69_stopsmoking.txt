I don't know how to quit

I'm desperate, I've tried everything. Allen Carr nope, nicotine gum, nope, cold turkey nope, patches no deal there either. All the nicotine products and nothing, all the books and websites nothing. I've even tried sports and that won't help either.

I feel like a loser every time I smoke, but every time I end up smoking again. I'm afraid I'll end up dead because I smoke and I freaking hate it. Every time I'm getting ahead of the game I relapse and I'm at square one.

Help me, what can I do? Am I just not trying hard enough.

Psck a day for fifteen freaking years. Sorry for the rant, mods feel free to delete if this don't belong here.

EDIT: Plan of action for tomorrow: patch and if necessary I take a gum. I have a short day with a nonsmoking co-worker and after that I have a day off.

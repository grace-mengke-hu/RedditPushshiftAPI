passed 100 days without knowing it!

yep! I was lurking today on reddit and found out casually hitting this sub that I am at 107 days! feels great, not for the 3 digit mark but most because I do not count days anymore! I love each day more than ever because I do not smoke anymore! breath is better, exercising is better, now also drinking is easy with no cravings! My lungs started to cleanse themselves so I feel the urge to expell catharr more now then ever, this is the only drawback, but it reminds me the shit I've put into my lungs for 5+ years of smoking...
Keep on guys!

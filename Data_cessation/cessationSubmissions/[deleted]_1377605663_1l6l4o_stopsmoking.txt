Careful with Hooka.

After quitting smoking for so long and abstaining from cigarettes for a while I decided to smoke some Hooka with some friends. It was a special occasion for his Birthday and it was a foolish mistake for me to get myself involved in tobacco again.

I can see how people relapse after having tobacco products. It's the day after and I almost bought a Black and Mild leading to that shaky slope of relapse. I had to slap my brain a few times to remind it that it is the nicotine withdraw, not that I miss tobacco.

If it wasn't for past mistakes of trying to quit with Black and Milds, I might have sunk back into the cycle. Because, for me, Cloves and Black/Milds is how I got into cigs, so I understand how history has a way of repeating itself.

Holy shit... you will soon realize that it is almost too easy to fall off the bandwagon again. Fucking cigarettes, I can't believe they are still haunting me now. 

Whew, crisis avoided though. I warn anyone who messes with fire, *you will* get burned. I just hope for your sake, you can be like me and avoid the temptation.

Now to suffer the consequences of nicotine withdraw again.

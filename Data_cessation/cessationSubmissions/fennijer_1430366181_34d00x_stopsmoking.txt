The Support here is just....

Sometimes I don't have the words to tell you all how Awesome the help I've had and am still having here is. I have a few friends struggling with quitting and over and over AND OVER again I mention this site. Thanks all for the all the crazy love!! It's still hard and still sucks but Fuck does it FEEL SOOOOO GOOD!!! Breathing in? GOOD! Running with my kids? GOOOOOOOOD!!! 

So much good! So much Love!Does it get easier? Sometimes. Some days blow hard! Do we have to keep trying?? 

EVERY FUCKING DAY!
But it's worth it!

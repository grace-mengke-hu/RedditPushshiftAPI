Herbal cigs

Hey guys ! Im looking for a good brand that gives you that " throat kick ". Brands ive tried. Like Honeyrose and Deal, they seem to light for me. 

I pretty much dont have cravings anymore unless i have a few drinks.  Which case i stop  caring that im trying to quit smoking tobacco completely. 

Thanks!

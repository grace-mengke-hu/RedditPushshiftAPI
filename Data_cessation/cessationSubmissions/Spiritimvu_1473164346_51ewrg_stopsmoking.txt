I fully hate myself

Day 4of the quit, 1:15pm.  
How dare I do this to myself! Smoking? Really!!? And with asthma too, the money I have wasted the sickness I have put up with, and throughout all that never thought how fucking stupid I was for doing so.  
I hate myself! I hate that I ever smoked, I hate young me for doing it, and I hate older me for not quitting sooner, I'm a fucking idiot and I deserve all this withdrawal symptom shit, I probably deserve worse.   
This is a bad day

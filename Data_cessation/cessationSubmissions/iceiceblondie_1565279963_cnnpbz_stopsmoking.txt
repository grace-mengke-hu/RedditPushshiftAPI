Quit ecig/juul :( just need support and suggestions to help with cravings/withdrawl

Hey guys, so this is day 2 no ecig for me and its already really bad. I started with the juul when I was 16 and a junior in high school, I'm now 20 and going to be a junior in college this year (so 4 years hooked on this shit). I've owned every device under the sun from juul, to phix, to Juno, every suorin device they've come out with (literally every single one), and now back to juul. I am seriously addicted to these things. I freak out if I can't find it, I feel the need to hit every other couple minutes except for when I'm in class or asleep, go through at least a pod a day and two packs of pods or more a week-- this is why I decided it's time to quit! I'm studying to go to medical school to be a doctor, so i'm ashamed that I ever even started smoking in the 1st place and have to write this post, but now 2 days off of it i'm really finding it hard. I'm finding myself more sleepy than usual, I can't concentrate/ am super antsy as I sit here and try to study for my summer classes, and my head just feels super out of it in a way I don't really know how to describe. I know I need to quit for my health, my wallet, and to not be a hypocrite in my future career. ANY recommendations for cravings/withdrawl and support is greatly appreciated and very welcome. Thanks guys!

wanting a change

So I've smoked daily since about age 15, and turned 30 this year. That half-a-lifetime math inspired a four month cold turkey quit that went awash in April. Not to list excuses, but I had a major anxiety episode that equated to days of minimal sleep and my resolve cracked. I openly and whole heartedly returned to a pack a day habit.

Now we're three months later and I'm tired of being a smoker again. The stink, the physical drag, and the mental fog all suck, but my most pressing motivation is that I work in family services for a religious non profit part time but am transitioning to a full time position. There will be no smoke breaks, and there will be no personal tolerance for being in active withdraw while helping families through crisis.

I'm considering another cold turkey today or tomorrow. I live with two other smokers and my four children, so temptation and stress triggers are everywhere. 

Just posting my thoughts here. I've quit for various periods in the paSt and know cold turkey works best for me. I've got lists out the ass for distractions, motivations, and techniques. I just wish that those were enough on their own.

Tl;Dr playing with the notion of a new and final quit. Posting as a means to check back on myself.

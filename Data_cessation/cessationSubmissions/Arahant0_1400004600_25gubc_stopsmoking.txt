Final cigarette extinguished

Hello, everyone! I have been trying to quit on and off for the past few years. I've been smoking for five. I tried the patch, gum, and E-cigs. I've mostly tried quitting cold turkey, using Allen Carr's Easyway method, and succeeded for a month before having a fight with my girlfriend and lighting one up out of spite. I showed her, right? The petty things we humans are capable of...

I downloaded a book last night off of whyquit.com titled Freedom From Nicotine. I found it much more readable than Allen's book. Even though I read it three times, I think my hatred for his writing style got in the way of truly absorbing the message. If you've read his book, and it didn't click with you, I urge you to download and read Freedom From Nicotine. Right now, if possible. I devoured the book, and upon extinguishing my final cigarette, felt nothing but readiness and determination, instead of my usual dread and terror. I feel that this time will be different. Wish me luck, and once again, download that book from whyquit if you haven't made the jump yet.

450 days.

  When ever im boastful about not smoking.  I end up the next day with hardcore cravings for what ever reason.  Its like mental karma i've created.   I won't smoke but i have the feeling like i need one.  Not that it would help me in any way shape or form.  It would just make me a smoker again and having a non not stop feeling of this.  One of the best things about not smoking.  Not having the feeling of impending doom that if i dont smoke my head is going to explode.  Had a chat with my brother about how i quit.  One of the reason i never bring it up unless asked in irl or online.  When ever i do the craving come floating back but they arent hard to beat but it does last for acouple hours.

1st post - 1st crappy day after 2 weeks smoke-free

Hello there! This is my first post on this sub. I took many brakes from smoking, but this time it is for real. Although I am very motivated, today is my first REAL crappy day after 2 weeks free, and oh my god, I have such an intense craving right now. Does anybody has any tips for tackling the craving and the stress that it generates? Much appreciated!

Sleeping Disturbance - when will it even itself out?

Hello everyone!  I am 66 days strong today, and as of today, no danger of "falling off the wagon".  I am really proud of how far I have come and my success thus far.

My question is if anyone has experienced a disturbance in their sleeping for this long?  Day to day, I teeter on mild anxiety and depression, and don't take anything for it.  So lack of sleep and not using smoking as a coping mechanism makes the struggle very, very real...each and every day.  Advice?

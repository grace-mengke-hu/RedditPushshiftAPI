"Daddy, you'll get cancer" and now I finally want to quit for good.

I am finally ready. 16 years of heavy smoking. I want and I NEED to quit. 
The final straw came last night. I have shared custody for my 5yo son. His mom's boyfriend tries telling him for some time now that he was his dad. So I have to tell my son from time to time that people can only have one daddy but a lot of friends. 
So last night I took him to his mom's place. My SO and I had tickets for a Christmas concert in a church here in Berlin. Son's mom showed up 40 minutes later than agreed on. I was stressed out and took my son to the near christmas market where I bought him a hot chocolate and for myself a hot christmas wine. Since I was stressed out I smoked a cigarette, while standing 3 meters next to my son. 
He turned to me and said: "Daddy, if you smoke, you'll get cancer." I said, yes, you're right, that's daddy's bad habit. 
"Daddy, you know if you will get cancer and die, -mom'sboyfriend- will actually be my daddy."

That hit me right in the heart. Now is the time. 
I need to stop right now. Any recommendations on how to start? I saw some of you using an app. I'll take any help I can get. I am grateful for everything.

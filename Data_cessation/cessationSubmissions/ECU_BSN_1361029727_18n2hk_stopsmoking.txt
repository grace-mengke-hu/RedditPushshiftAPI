[Intro] a Lurkey-Loo now Joining yooooooou!

I am still a smoker. Going on (gut check) 21 years of smoking. I had quit for 18 months (used chantix) and relapsed. That was 2 years ago. I went bat $hit crazy on chantix before. I am doing a trial of 0.25 mg for week one then 0.5 mg week two. If I have the same reaction....plan B is the patch. Will update with my quit date. 
For those who are working through a rough season/fighting a relapse: as I sit here typing this I am dragging cigs through my bronchitis and sinusitis filled body. Every drag is painful and the cough is awful. It stinks. This is the nature of our addiction.....iDCare if you are 24 hrs out or 24 months out. This is not wort EVEN ONE CIG. if you have beat your battle and have started making the right choices....bravo! Take a nice deep breath in for me....I will be along shortly with my badge! 
TL;DR: 21 years and ramping up to stop this ISH!!!!
PS: and I work hospice....I will have daily reminders about the importance of stopping!!! End stage Lung cancer and COPD are AWFUL!!!

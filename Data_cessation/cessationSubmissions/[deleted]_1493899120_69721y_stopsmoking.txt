Already getting tired of convincing myself

Its been 5 days and I'm already tired of convincing myself not to smoke. The urge to smoke has become so annoying, I dont know what to do. I feel like just giving up if its going to be like this for the next months and years to come. How am I suppose to do this for so long when its so exhausting?

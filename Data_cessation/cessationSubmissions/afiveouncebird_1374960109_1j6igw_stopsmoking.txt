Friday at the bars.

I've quit at least a dozen times. At *least*. And it ranges from a day, to a week, to this one time I lasted 6 months. I usually set a time frame; I'll quit for a month or two or whatever, and this is usually a crutch when I get bad cravings. "At least I'll be able to smoke this time next month". This time that crutch is gone, and I want it to quit for good. I'm on day 14.

The hardest part for me is the bar scene. I like drinking. I like being drunk. I like the company of drunks. Cigarettes, unfortunately, go hand in hand with this lifestyle. And it seems all my favorite activities, whether bowling, pool, darts, golf, are lazy sports that go hand in hand with smoking. 

Anyway, last night I got confronted by a guy who would just not leave me alone. He was obnoxiously drunk, and kept thrusting a cigarette in my face, making me feel like an asshole for refusing one. He was being rude to me and the girl I was with. It continued for a few minutes, until I put it in my mouth, let him light it, held it until he left, and tossed it. 

I feel like I handled the situation pretty well. Ideally I would have been stubborn, made an issue of it, put my foot down in an absolutist sort of way. Instead I diffused the situation best I could and placated the drunk guy without taking the opportunity to smoke or compromise my values. 

Not the most exciting story, but one I felt compelled to share. Cheers.

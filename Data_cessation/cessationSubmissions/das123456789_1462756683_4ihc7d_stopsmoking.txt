Please help me quit, i literally crying right now cuz im addicted to this shit

Im a 23 year old, and got addicted to cigs 2 years ago. I was depressed and when you are sad, they seem like a great idea. Now my family found out, and they all look at me like a piece of shit everytime Im late from somewhere, or go for a "walk". i have lost all respect for my self. But I just cant stop, shit is eting me up inside. Cant even look at myself in the mirror, because all it does is remind me of how much of a better person I sued to be before I started smoking. How did you quit? I notice that my withdrawal goes away in 3 days, but then the mind games start, and I eventually buy more. I literally had 20 dollars left from my chequing account money until tmrw (when I get paid) and spent my last 20 on a fucking pack.

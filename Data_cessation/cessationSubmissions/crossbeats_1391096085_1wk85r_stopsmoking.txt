How else do you get out of awkward situations?

I've been wanting to quit smoking for awhile, but I already know what my biggest roadblock is going to be. I use going outside for a smoke as a reason to excuse myself from situations I'm ready to be done with. A party is starting to get overwhelming. I'm bored at a family event. A co-worker nearby is being annoying. Obviously it's not socially acceptable to say, "I don't want to be near you right now, so I'm going to walk away," so I'll say I'm going to go smoke.  
  
I realize this is a completely weak excuse for not quitting, but I want to elimination ALL my reasons for not quitting. Any advice?

Any tips for staying strong after a week or two?

I'm currently on day 4.  I've quit in the past, but when I relapse, it usually happens a couple weeks to a month in.  I find that I'm hypervigilant about my inner addict creeping into my thoughts in the first week or so, since it's happening all the time.  After the thoughts aren't near constant, it's like I let my guard down and get taken unawares when cravings strike and I don't feel ready for them.  Any advice?

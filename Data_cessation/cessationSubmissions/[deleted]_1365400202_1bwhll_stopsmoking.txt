How I quit smoking

About 50 days ago I had a seizure. I had been getting headaches for a few days, alternating between quitting smoking and chain smoking 30 a day when I broke 2-3 days later. So one day I was smoking a cigarette and I stood up, got hit with the worst pain in my life in my head, and fell down unconscious. I remember when I came to my thought was "I need to put this smoke out I'm gonna burn the house down." That's when I realized I was paralyzed. About a minute or two later I could move my arms again, and called 911. It took 4 neurologists to figure out what was wrong with me, a condition called RCVS, which is a constriction of blood vessels in your brain. It can cause seizures, strokes, or hemorrhages. All of those can kill you immediately. They told me it was most likely caused by drug use when I was younger, but that my heavy smoking definitely affected it and made it worse. I quit right there cold turkey, basically just out of fear. They have me on meds and say I should be alright in a month or two, but the last 5 weeks I have been in 4 hospitals and I don't know how many doctors. I used to lurk on here when I was smoking or trying to quit, and then go back to smoking. Just fucking quit already, I am not really young but I am not an old man either, way too young to be having seizures at least. Quit now and let your body heal some. And for all you that say "I don't give a fuck about dying..." I said the same thing, still do sometimes. What that doesn't take into account is that you could end up severely impaired and unable to speak or move normally, requiring constant care for the rest of your life. Dying doesn't scare me, but that shit does.

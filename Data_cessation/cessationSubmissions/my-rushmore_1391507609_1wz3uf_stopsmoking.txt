Anyone find that since quitting cigarettess for ecigarettes that they have 0 energy?

Usually I get up up at 7:30am to be able to leave the house at 8:15am for the hour long walk to work, but the past few weeks I can't drag myself out of bed and end up laying about until 8:30am and getting a taxi, meaning I'm spending more money than I would smoking! I'm crashing out as soon as I get home as well.

The only thing that has changed is that I switched to ecigarettes around the same time. Anyone find the same thing? If so, how long did it last, or what did you do? I'm coming up to 4 weeks off the real cigarettes tomorrow.

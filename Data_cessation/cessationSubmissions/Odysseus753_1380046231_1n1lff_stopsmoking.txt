For those who have quit using NRT and continue to use NRT, did you still have that feeling of "Wow, I feel so much better now that I'm not smoking!"?

I'm fairly new here, but I definitely get the impression that the majority here favor a cold turkey approach and are unfavourably disposed towards nicotine replacement therapy - "You're still addicted!" But everything I've read indicates that the harm from nicotine alone is miniscule compared to the harm caused by all the thousands of other chemicals in tobacco smoke. So for the time being, I would want to focus on stopping the process of killing myself by inhaling thousands of different toxins every day. Once I've got that down cold, *then* I'll assess how harmful (or not) nicotine is. Call it a harm reduction approach.

So, those of you who also used and continue to use NRT, did your body reward you for quitting smoking?

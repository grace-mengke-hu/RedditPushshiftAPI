I get to make my own choices.

Hey friends, 

I feel like I haven't posted recently but I wanted to share some advice that has helped me tremendously. When I first started this I felt anxious, was I ever going to smoke again, was I going to miss it, could I do it? 

Every time I get a craving(which is not very often anymore surpsingly). When I do have a craving or I watch people smoking I always tell myself, "You get to make your own choices. You can have a cigarette if you really want one. You can also choose not to have a cigarette. Which do you really want?"

Just by giving the power back to myself I find myself not really wanting to smoke. It's up to me. It's not up to my addiction brain or my stress or my anxiety or whatever reason I used to use for smoking, it is up to me. 


Keep it up guys!

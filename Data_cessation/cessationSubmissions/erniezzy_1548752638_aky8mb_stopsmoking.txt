Advice for those trying to Quit

I am on 18 days of being smoke free. I turn 35 this year &amp; I’ve been smoking since I was 15 years old. I was basically smoking more than half a pack a day, sometimes a whole pack. This will be my third time quitting. Both times I quit I only lasted 4 months.                           I feel the difference Between this time around &amp; the last two times is, I’m actually genuinely ready to quit, it’s not because I got sick, health issues or something happened to where I abruptly had to. You have to mentally be ready to quit, it’s all in your head. I remembered the first time I quit, it was hard, I was craving every single day for 4 months, I missed it and I wanted it &amp; I couldn’t stop thinking about it, &amp; same story with the second time, I always told myself maybe when I’m ready I can be a social smoker? Have one when I drink or go out. Or I could smoke once in awhile as long as I don’t buy my own pack. Big mistake lol.            The difference with the NOW this time around is that I am 100% in on it &amp; im physically and mentally ready. I don’t even think about it anymore at all, now I don’t, &amp; my secret is, whenever I feel even the slightest urge to smoke, I think about something negative, that nicotine has done to me, whenever I got the urge to smoke, I remember the times I felt like puking, like teary eyed puking cause I smoked too much, how my hair is thinning and how my hair smells &amp; my nails turning yellow from smoking or how my teeth is staining. Of course my health is most important but thinking about something really horrible and trying to really picture that moment helped me lose the craving instantly lol. I even try to fake imitate myself puking in my head. Whatever trauma or negative experience you’ve had With smoking keep that in mind and make those negative experiences help you make positive changes for your health. I wholeheartedly feel like this is really it, you wanna know why ? It’s only been 18 days and I’ve gone to two bars, a party with drinking involved I got drunk and never gave in just the thought of the times I puked from nicotine killed the urge to even want a smoke. The other times I quit smoking, drinking was horrible because smoking a cigg was best after you ate, you woke up or before bed or when you’re drunk. Now I can do anything &amp; don’t even want to smoke as if I trained my brain to forget cigarettes completely, because I turned all my negative experiences into positive thinking.                     Long story I know but I just wanted to help anyone out there trying to quit and is having a hard time, you can do it, prepare yourself mentally, think about all the negative experiences you’ve had With cigarettes, and last but not least make sure you’re ready and do it for you. Good luck everybody !

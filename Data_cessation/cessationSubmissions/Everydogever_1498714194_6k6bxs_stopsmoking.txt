18 days in....

And I'm doing very well. I'm starting to realize I took breathing for granted, and now I remember what it's like to not struggle to breathe. I didn't smoke for more than 10 years, but it was mostly six years. On the plus side, I've been eating way more food than I ever had in my life.

 Still, I was super addicted and used to smoke every thirty minutes. I had constant obsessive thoughts about smoking even if I was doing something I enjoyed. I'm glad that I don't have to be outside every thirty minutes and I'm working on never smoking ever again.

I've been using the EasyQuit stop smoking app for Android and it's nice to keep track of your progress this way. I hope this helps other people. Break the habit! Smoking means you're not in control of your life.

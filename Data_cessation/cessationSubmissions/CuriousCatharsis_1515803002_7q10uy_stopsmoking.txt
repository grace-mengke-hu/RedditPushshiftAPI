Organization

Sometimes I miss how cigarettes 'organized' my day:

I'll finish up this work before this smoke break, and then do that work after.


I just got hired at more of an "office job" (been in the service game since college) and am a little nervous how it will be without smoke breaks; how focused I can remain without my before/after.  But I know I need to learn this, soon and desperately, to be able to reach the goals I want in life.  I've been kind of letting the days pass and so am excited and hopeful this opportunity will bring some structure and motivation back :)

Finally back on track!

My  badge is off but I'm currently 16 days 15 hrs 16 mins into this long awaited journey (using an iphone app for a counter atm). 

It's been kind of a cop out. I'm using an e cig for these past 16 days. I don't know if that counts as actually quitting for good but I'm using this as a stepping stone for now. The longest time I was able to quit for cold turkey was for 34 days around December of last year. I do get the urge to smoke on rare occasions. Especially when I'm drunk. Lately, I've been quite unhappy for unknown reasons and things seem to keep piling up on top. Victim in a car accident, stress from school/work but fortunately none of these have pushed me to the point of needing/wanting to smoke. I'm very fortunate that my girlfriend is so kind and supportive. 

I'm not entirely sure why I'm making this post. It just feels good to type it out.

Having some real problems quitting.

I just can't shake it off of me. Its so hard to fight the cravings when its all so readily available and everything in me says I need that nicotine. I've become a pack a day smoker and I'll usually chain smoke when I'm bored. I'm getting a vape soon so maybe that will help.

Start new job, stop smoking?

Hi all!  I've been unemployed for about four months, and finally starting a new gig June 1 (yay! yay! yay!).  So, whilst i was unemployed quitting wasn't an option: with literally nothing to do all day, pretty much all I ever did was think about my next cigarette.   But with the new job, and the sudden and drastic change in my routine, I'm thinking this might be a good time to quit.  However, the little addicted person inside of me is saying "you're gonna be so stressed, and so over-worked, you're gonna need a cig." And "do you really want to put yourself through cig withdrawal when you're trying to make a good first impression on your new co-workers/bosses/etc?"

So, thoughts? I'm pretty sure I know what you guys are gonna say, but sometimes you just need to hear it.

Thanks!

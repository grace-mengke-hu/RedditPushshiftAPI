How to help my boyfriend with quitting?

Hi guys. I have a boyfriend who is a smoker. He has quit before in the past and is currently trying to quit again. He has been using nicotine gum, but on particularly stressful days or when he gets upset, he will sometimes slip up and have a few cigarettes. I have been really supportive of him quitting, and I've expressed how much I worry about his health. So when he tells me that he's slipped up, it bothers me, but I try to stay positive with him.

Last night, I found that he'd bought a pack of cigarettes the day before. Last night we were at the pub with a friend of mine, and my boyfriend said he'd be back in a minute. He came back reeking of cigarettes. When we went home, I expressed that I was upset that he'd just casually gone outside to light up, and told him I am worried that he's going to fall back into smoking a pack a day like he used to. He said he only did because "they were there", so I pushed and pushed for him to give me his pack he'd bought, that still had five cigarettes in it. Eventually he handed it over, but was reluctant.

Basically, I'm trying to walk a fine line here. I want to push him to quit, and I want to support him, but I also don't want to become just a source of nagging. I wanted to ask you guys, what do you find helpful in regards to significant others/friends/family's behaviour with helping you quit? How can I best help him?

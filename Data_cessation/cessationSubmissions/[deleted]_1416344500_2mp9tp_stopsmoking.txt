Occasional smoker working to change habits

Hi all, just wanted to say how much respect I have for all of you for quitting an staying away. 26M been smoking on and off since 14. I keep buying packs, smoking a few and then tossing the pack. I can't believe how strong the draw is with these vile things especially when drinking. I'm in the medical profession and should be fucking better than this. I have a number of vices between drinking, smoking and porn that I am constantly frustrated with myself about and I am trying to change into the person I want to be.

PS: it is cold as shit and smoking in this weather sucks.

Are there many occasional smokers in this community?
Are there lifestyle changes that accompany your quitting process?

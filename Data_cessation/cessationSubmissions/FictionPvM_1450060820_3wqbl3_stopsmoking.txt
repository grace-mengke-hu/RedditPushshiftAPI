End of my second full day, need help.

As the title states, I'm a recent quitter. However, the hard part will be the weekdays (I believe so, anyways). I work outdoors in a lumber yard, where smoking is allowed. If that isn't bad enough, 80% are smokers. I have tried quitting in the past but don't usually make it past 4 days. This is the most I can say I have ever wanted to quit, due to health reasons as well as smoking is expensive. Anyways, what tips can you give me in order to stay strong while I'm at work? Or even when not at work. I can't get on the subreddit during the work day and that's what I usually do when I'm craving. Thank you, and best of luck to all!

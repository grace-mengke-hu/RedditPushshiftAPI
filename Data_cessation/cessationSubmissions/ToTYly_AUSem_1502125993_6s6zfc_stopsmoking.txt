Going to have to take a 3 hr car ride, and go to a concert, 4 days into quitting...

Hey guys, 

Just posting this here for some support. Quit a few times before (sometimes up to two months of no smoking) and I know that I can do it officially. This past weekend I was really short with money for rent so I decided to not buy a pack of cigarettes (I was basically at one pack a day) and I have successfully made it into day 3. 

I've had plans to go to Philly with a good friend for about a month, and I just had the whim to quit smoking right before that. I feel good on the inside finally, and I know a cigarette will actually make me feel shitty even though I still want one. So I know I'm in a real place to quit.

But I must say, I am very nervous to be in a car for 3 hrs and go to a Die Antwoord concert. I'm someone that used to chain smoke at concerts (and being under the influence doesn't help, although I know I can do it). 

Oh, I quit cold turkey because I've found if I give into the nicotine withdrawal it doesn't actually get rid of my cravings, just makes them go away for a while. So I'm just training my brain just like with my exes.

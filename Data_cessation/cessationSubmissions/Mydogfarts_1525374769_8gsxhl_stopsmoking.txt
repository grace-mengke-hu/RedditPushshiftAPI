I never considered myself a smoker

I never bought a pack of cigarettes when sober and could never stand smoking one during the day, but when I get wild on weekends with alcohol my mind switches and the cravings set in. Sometimes I end up smoking half a pack in one night and the following days are always filled with regret and I feel like this habit is setting me backwards. I need to stop considering myself a nonsmoker and realize my detrimental habits need to be addressed in a serious manner.

Thanks for listening

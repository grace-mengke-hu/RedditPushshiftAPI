Weird dreams?

Hey guys,

I've heard of people having weird dreams after they quit smoking. I have always had weird dreams so I was wondering what kind if dreams people have. 

Last night I dreamt I climbed a never ending flight of stairs to take a test where one of the questions was "are you a smoker or non-smoker?"  I was so excited to put non-smoker I wanted to take a picture. There were other weird things in my dream (eating cereal with my friends in a bar wearing boxer shorts and a tee) but that was the smoking related weirdness.

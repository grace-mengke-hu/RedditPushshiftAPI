Smokers/lurkers: Calculate how long you spend each day smoking a cigarette

And then when you do stop, replace that time by doing something productive that is new to you.

I used to smoke close to a pack & a half a day (about 35 cigarettes) and an average of 4 minutes a smoke (time to get outside & smoke) So I found something to occupy about 3-4 hours of my time when i stopped (it was working out, and making meal plans).

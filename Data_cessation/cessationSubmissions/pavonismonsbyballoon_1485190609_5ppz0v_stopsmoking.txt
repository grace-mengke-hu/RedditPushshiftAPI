Need help from those who quit and started smoking again.

SOS. 

I smoked for six years or so then quit after reading Allen Carr's book for another four or five years. Then I started to smoke again after some acute work related stress. 

Now I'm finding it exponentially harder to quit again. I've read the books again and tried patches, each of which helped me stop for a few months but after a while I get back to it. 

Help! I need some tips from those who have gone through this themselves. Thanks in advance.

Dear r/stopsmoking, I'm have a bit of a rough day.

As you guys can see I quit on new years. I've been successful until now and In the past have quit successfully for a few months before going back. 

Today a lot has been on my mind. I graduated university in December and have had a rough time getting a job post college. The pressure for income is starting to really get to me (though the pressure is all coming from my own ambitions.) I do not have expenses as I'm living at home with my family but I have never been the dead weight in the family. All day ive read nothing but rejections from applications and I've wanted nothing more than to go down to the corner and pick up a pack or a loosey and just drag away on it. 

I feel like life has become so monotonous without cigarettes. One long unbroken struggle is all i feel during the day. No clear breaks inbetween days.

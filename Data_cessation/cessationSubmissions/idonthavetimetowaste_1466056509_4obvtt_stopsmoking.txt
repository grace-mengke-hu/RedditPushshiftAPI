Day 0 here we go again

It's 10:52pm, and I just had my last cigarette of my life.
Last couple weeks, I was trying to quit for awhile and today went pretty well. It was my first cigarette and I convinced myself to smoke one more "just to see how it feels". I feel depressed. I was actually feeling very motivated and fulfilled of life but now I just feel so bad. I'll keep updating to see how it goes. Wish me luck!

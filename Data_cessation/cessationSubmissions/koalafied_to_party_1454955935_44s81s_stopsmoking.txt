Mild-major trigger

I'm visiting my mom for the first time since I quit and she smokes. I get really anxious when I'm visiting her and we used to smoke together to wind down. I know now that it won't help me to wind down at all because I'm no longer withdrawing and when I think about how it would actually feel to smoke a cigarette, I am really adverse to it. But I'm getting like really dizzy, it's really weird. It's like I don't know how to escape from family visit anxiety anymore. 

It's pretty much passing now. Writing this post helped pass time and kinda talk it out with myself. *sigh* my mom's back inside from having a smoke. I really wish everyone would quit. I want to be excited about quitting and talk with her about it but I don't want to come off as all preachy preachy- I got here yesterday and didn't even tell her I'd quit until today and this is day 9 for me. My partner is here with me and she is the biggest support as well as you guys and my quitting app so I feel really strong in not smoking and really supported but I wish it was something that my mom could be really supportive of also.

Phew. I didn't smoke. Ok, back to real life. That's done. Thanks for being here, guys, and for letting me rant.

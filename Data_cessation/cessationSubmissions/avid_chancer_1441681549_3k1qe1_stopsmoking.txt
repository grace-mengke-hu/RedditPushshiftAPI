1 month now but partner just started again

I quit smoking in early August. It just felt wrong after a while. I woke up one morning after a night with little to no sleep and I just knew that I wanted to quit. This was amazing for me because the last time I quit I only did it for my partner. 

He has been smoking for almost a decade. In early march we quit together. Back then, I really quit to help him quit so it's no wonder I started up again.

 This time around I quit just for me though. It's been one month now and I feel good. The only thing is I really want a cigarette right now. My partner is having a hard time and just went out to buy a pack. I'm sitting here knowing I probably won't join him but also really worried about what it will mean to date a smoker now that I am an ex smoker. 

I'm scared and wondering if anyone else has been in this position?

Does weed count?

It’s day 4. No nicotine, no weed, and no medication. 
I’m not against weed. I’ll never feel the need to ‘quit’ weed. But I did decide to quit smoking it. I’m waiting now for edibles but they have not yet arrived. 
I’d love to have a cheeky little cone to take the edge off, but does that count as smoking?? 

Please help?

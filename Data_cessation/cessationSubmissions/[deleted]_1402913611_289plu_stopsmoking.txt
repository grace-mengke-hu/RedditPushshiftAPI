Dreaming about cigarettes every night

I still haven't gotten a full eight hours. The sleep I do get is littered with dreams of smoking, which make me wake up depressed that both I didn't smoke and that I feel guilty for smoking.

Do the dreams ever end, or at least stop happening every night? I am two days away from two weeks.

200 days and I relapsed...But Here I quit again

Hello, I quit smoking for 200 days...I didn't really relapse...I made a choice to start smoking moderately....so I started smoking 1 at night...I did this for about a week...then on a saturday night I smoked 7....after that I started smoking about 10 a day...

So...I got really sick on monday night.. i catched the flu...and I have not smoked since Monday night....

Today I feel much better...so I was thinking about enjoying a cigarette...but the problem is that I was never enjoying my cigarettes...when I only had 1 at night...I felt like another...but I forced myself not to smoke....then when I started smoking 10 a day...it was NOT enjoyable....I was just trying to ease the PAIN from the withdrawl of nicotine.

smoking cigarettes is not enjoyable guys...maybe the first cigarette you have is enjoyable....but then the addiction makes it painful...I felt dirty again, with cigarette butts all over my ashtray, smoking indoors, smelling like tobacco and feeling weak again....

So I learned my lesson....

I am back baby! But this time wiser. I don't ever want to smoke again. 

A fool man can't get fooled again LOL

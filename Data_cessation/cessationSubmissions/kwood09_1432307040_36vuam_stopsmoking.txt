Had this horrible dream last night where I decided to smoke "just one." It seemed so incredibly real, and I've never been more relieved to wake up.

I don't remember the exact circumstances that caused me to think this way in my dream, but I decided that I'd have "just one" cigarette. But the thing was, I knew exactly how horrible of an idea it would be. After all, that was how I fell off the wagon in the past. So I knew very well that having "just one" would lead to a few more, then just one every night before bed, then a few in the evenings. And sure enough, in the dream, that's exactly what happened (I guess I was on some sort of fast forward montage.) I was so disappointed with myself the whole time. I knew what a horrible idea it was, but I was just giving in. 

I didn't even remember the dream until a couple hours later. Smoking hasn't been on my conscious mind much lately, and I'm coming up on five months without a cigarette. But I guess it always is lurking back there. 

So, if you ever are falling into the trap of "just one more", just take a step back. You know, even if it's down in your subconscious, that it's a horrible idea and that there's no such thing as that bullshit. When you "wake up" and realize that you've set yourself back, you'll feel horrible. Instead, if you can power through it, you'll be so relieved that you didn't give into that moment of temporary insanity.

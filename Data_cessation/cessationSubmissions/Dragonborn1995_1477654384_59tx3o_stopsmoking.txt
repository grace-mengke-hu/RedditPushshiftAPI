I need to quit, but cannot do it alone in a house full of smokers.

I am 20 years old, and soon turn 21. I have been smoking for 3 years, and it's time to stop.

But, everyone in my house but my 16 year old baby sister smokes like a chimney, and has no plan to quit anytime soon. They make it ridiculously hard not to light a cigarette when they are smoking and telling me I shouldn't at the same time. They say I haven't been smoking long enough to be addicted. Yeah, because they know exactly how I react to nicotine from how they do. I'm not trying to bag on them, I love my family. But they think they understand when they don't. My mother makes plans to quit every other month, my dad doesn't even try, and my other sister, who is 17, chain smokes. My youngest sister resents all of us for working around her, and I hate trying over and over, only to pick it back up after a stressful moment.

What should I do?

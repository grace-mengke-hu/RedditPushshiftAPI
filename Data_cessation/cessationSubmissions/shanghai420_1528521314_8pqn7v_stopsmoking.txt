I’ve been cigarette free for two weeks and I’m loving it!

I quit two weeks ago on a Wednesday with the help of Allen Carr’s book which I read in about two days. I have been a smoker for six years. The worst part is that I never shared with anyone that I smoked cigarettes and now I wish I had somebody to tell, because I’m so happy I made it this far and I feel free!

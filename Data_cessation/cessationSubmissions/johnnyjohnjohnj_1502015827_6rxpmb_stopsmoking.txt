How to quit smoking and not gain weight

Hello all.  I am currently 11 days smoke free.  Never had a reddit account.  I have been smoking about a pack a day for 15 plus years.  I am US military and have been living in Japan for the last 8 years, going back to USA this week.  Smoking is very prevalent in Japan, you can smoke in restaurants and bars, and cigarettes are cheap, about 4 USD per pack.  I made the decision to quit because of my kids and because of going to USA.  I have not had a cigarette in 11 days plus, and I have a app that helps track it, which is good.  The thing I am worried about is gaining weight.  I am currently 6 foot 1, 195 pounds.  Since I have stopped smoking I feel like I have more urges to over eat, as in, order a pizza at the end of the night and eat it, where as before, I would just go smoke a cigarette.  My mind is asking questions, is it worse to smoke, or is it worse to gain weight and eat more.  The obvious answer is to not smoke, and not eat more.  But that seems hard for me.  So I am asking for any tips or ideas from someone who has been in a similar situation.  I am also an alcoholic if that makes and difference, but that will not change.

Thank you for all. The replies. It means a lot to me. Seems like I just need to not worry about gaining a little weight because that is way better than continuing to smoke.

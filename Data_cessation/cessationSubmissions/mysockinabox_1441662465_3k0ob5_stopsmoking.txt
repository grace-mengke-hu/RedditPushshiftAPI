One year ago, I felt like I was dying.

Today it's been a year since I lit up. Every day was better that the last. It isn't hard. What was hard was realizing that it wasn't hard. I'd quit before, but until I felt like I was in danger, I didn't have the drive to succeed. Any of you can do it.

Thanks for all the support here. Reading other success stories is extremely helpful.

What's your favorite thing about being a non-smoker?

I'm an hour away from getting my first week (again)!

I've quit for a couple months about half a year ago using Chantix and reading Allan Carr's book. But just doing it cold turkey this time around and this subreddit has been really helpful to me so thank you for your posts and the people who are active on here even with long term ex-smoker status. Emotionally speaking, yesterday and today have been seemed much better (was quite the basket case days 3-5).

Would love to find encouragement in hearing what your favorite parts of being a non-smoker are.

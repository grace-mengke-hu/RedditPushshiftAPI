I need to stop smoking... I need to quit not only for myself, but for someone I care about, and I just can't.

I started last summer when I lost a lot of my friends because of stupid high school bullshit. I quit, and then started back up last winter. Then, I quit again because a friend figured out I was smoking and I didn't want that anymore. Then I got a girlfriend, everything was going good, and she broke up with me. I picked up smoking again in March and I haven't been able to quit. I go through a lot of cigarettes a day, so many that I lose count. Sometimes it's a pack a day that I smoke, if I'm with friends who smoke too. 

Recently, I've started talking to someone and I've told her that I need to quit and of course, she agrees with me. I care about her, I'm pretty sure I like her, and I just can't bring myself to quit smoking. Every time I try quitting, I won't smoke for a day, and then I'll start feeling sad and down on myself or just feel like I *need* to have a smoke and I convince myself into buying a pack. I've tried going with a hookah pen, but it just isn't the same. 

Maybe I should just start buying gum...

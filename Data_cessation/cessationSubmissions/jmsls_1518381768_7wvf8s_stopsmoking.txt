Day 1, survived

Whole sunday with no cigarettes. Now on to the work week which will be slightly harder, but perhaps easier when I'll just browse this subreddit before work and remind myself that I'm a non-smoker who absolutely does not want to trade thousands of Euros of sticks containing health hazards which waste your time for a small sensation of inhaling smoke which as evidenced before, does not make me feel better.

Seeing my thoughts as nothing but thoughts manifesting themselves as a result of a lack of expected action or stimuli has really helped though. It's not like I actually want to smoke. On to day two. I've got this.

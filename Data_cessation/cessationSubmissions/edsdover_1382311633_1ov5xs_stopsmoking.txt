Grandiose gestures and big plans...

Never really work guys. . . it feels powerful to exclaim, "No more! This is the last one I will ever have" and flush those puppies down the loo. 

I have quit a couple of times. First time it was for 4 months. I decided that I wanted to date a girl more than quit so I started again. Second time was about a month and a half ago.

The only thing that was common about both times was I didn't plan it. I decided to quit when I wanted to.

I guess what I am trying to say. Is that trying to quit is great, really great. But it kills me to watch so many of you set yourself up to fail.

In the end, what will really get you to quit smoking is you. Decide for yourself that you are ready. Whenever you want one, challenge yourself to not smoke today. Cravings can only last three minutes. 

Good Luck!

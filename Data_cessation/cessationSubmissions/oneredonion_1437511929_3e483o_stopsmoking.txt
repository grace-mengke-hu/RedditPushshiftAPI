How did I get here?

I am interested in your smoking careers.  Why and when did you start?  Why did you continue?  How would you describe your relationship with cigarettes?  Have you tried to quit successfully or unsuccessfully and how?  Triggers?  What are your roadblocks?  I am interested in what comes to your mind when you think of smoking cigarettes.

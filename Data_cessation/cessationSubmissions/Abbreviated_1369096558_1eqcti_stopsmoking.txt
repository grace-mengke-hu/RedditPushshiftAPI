Just lost a friend. Life's too short. Today is the day I quit!

I've been slowly putting this off for stupid reasons, but a friend of mine died this past weekend, and I realized how short life truly is. Time for me to step up to the plate and stop killing myself slowly. 

This is going to be tough =/   Also, hello stopsmoking! I'm new here.

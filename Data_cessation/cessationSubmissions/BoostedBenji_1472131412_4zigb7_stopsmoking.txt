10.5 days! (And I just went for a run)

I won't preach how hard its been, how much i've eaten and how many times I have googled "What if I just have one". 

What I will preach about is how AMAZING I feel after that run. I run half marathons and tough mudders and so on throughout the year but my god I have never experienced this feeling. I can breathe...I my heart rate is much slower and I am not sweating for hours after the run.

100% worth giving up and being a moody sh*t for a few days...heres to the next 10 days, weeks, years.

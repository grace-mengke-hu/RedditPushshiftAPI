Always could think of a reason not to quit...until a trip to the ER last week. 

Last week, I had to take my boyfriend (who is only 19) up to the emergency room thanks to a very serious lung problem, more than likely caused by smoking. Spent the whole weekend with him up there and we both have quit smoking!

Thankfully, he's fine now, but we never thought that something like that would happen to one of us. Really did open ours eyes to how poorly we were treating our bodies. Now we are both cig free and feel much better!

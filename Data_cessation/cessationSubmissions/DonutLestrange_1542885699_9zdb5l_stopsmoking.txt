Patch insight?

So I’ve been wearing patches since Sunday. I’m now day 8 no smokes (yay) and looking for some insight with the patches.

I’ve been wearing them at night since starting them and since then have woken up super anxious and have had broken sleep. So after some good old Googling it seems the consensus is you can have insomnia and vivid dreams (I never dream whatsoever) and last night I decided to take the patch off and don’t want to jinx it but I fell asleep within an hour and slept until around relatively normal time. 

Could the patches be causing this and my morning anxiety? I don’t seem to be craving most mornings first thing either.

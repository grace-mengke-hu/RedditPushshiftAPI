How do you control cravings?

I've been smoking for three years, since I turned 19. Over those three years, I have cut back, but every time I tried to cut down, I ended up binging on cigarettes and started smoking more than i was before I attempted to cut down. Now, as of an hour ago, I am taking the plunge and going cold turkey. I realize it's the only way. I realize what a huge mental challenge this will be, but I know it's possible to accomplish. 

Now, my only question is how do you deal with cravings once you've quit? Sometimes I would get cravings, so I would chew on a toothpick, play with it in my mouth to satisfy the oral fixation. It helped. But I also do not want to develop a new bad habit. 

What's your favorite technique to neutralize that craving?

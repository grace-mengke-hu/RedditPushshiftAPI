Ninety Days Today

Here's to another ninety. I don't post here very often (not on Reddit much at the moment) but this group really inspired me early on.

Don't miss the biffs at all. Everything feels so much better and I hardly ever get cravings. I have the SmokeFree app on my phone and have to go to it every now and then just to remember how long it's been.

After the first couple of weeks I really just didn't think about it at all. It's very easy after the first few weeks.

Good luck everyone and thanks to everyone here for being great and supportive. This is a great group.

Thanks a lot.

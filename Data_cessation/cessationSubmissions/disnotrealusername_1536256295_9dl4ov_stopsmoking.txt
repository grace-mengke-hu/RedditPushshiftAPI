If your partner were to bring up some noticeable changes in your health while you were smoking, how would you want him/her to approach it?

I've noticed my partner is coughing and constantly clearing his throat in the mornings now. It's always been a little noticeable, but now I can hear him from downstairs while I'm still in bed (he gets up about 30 min before me each day-- partially so he has time to smoke before work). The cough sounds more phlegm-y (sorry if gross) and it lasts longer. I've also seen his spit in the sink and it's a gross yellow color.

I know a that neither a lecture nor nagging will encourage him to quit, so I don't want to mess up this conversation; my point is that I'm seriously concerned about his health because I love him. If you have suggestions on how you would want a partner to raise the issue, I'd appreciate your input. Thank you!

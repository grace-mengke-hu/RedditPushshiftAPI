Resetting, more enthusiastically and sooner this time

Quit for 5 days before a move, but got stressed out while packing. Had about 3 packs over a week since then. This time instead of waiting months, I'm right back at it.

The pattern I picked up last time is that the addiction takes advantage of my rule-based, strategic thinking. It won't let me quit until certain days, or promises me that the habit will be limited. If any thing or person had such a history of lying to me, I'd have ditched them long ago. Funny how smoking exempts itself.

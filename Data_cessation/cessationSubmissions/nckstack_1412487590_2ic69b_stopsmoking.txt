629 days and I still have a craving.

But it faded within seconds after I smelt the smoke. The cigarette unlit smells so good. Gosh do I like the smell of tobacco, its to bad its so darn bad for you. I have not had a single cigarette and I quit cold turkey using the easy way after ten years of smoking and trying to quit. Then I stopped. It was hard but then it was easy. You have to just make your mind up to quit and not let yourself down. And don't worry it was second hand smoke.

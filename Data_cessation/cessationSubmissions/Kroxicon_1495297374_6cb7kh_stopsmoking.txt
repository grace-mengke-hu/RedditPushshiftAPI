Nearly bought a boat, dodgy seller and i ended up smoking again.

Wednesday i took a long train ride to a sailboat i was going to buy, seller forgot to mention fees which wasn't paid for and i would have had a boat and a good amount of debt as well. I felt pretty cheated and was angry/stressed so i ended up smoking thursday when i found out about that stuff. I stopped again today, but i feel like poop for not sticking with the smoking stop. 
I have a shitty taste in my mouth today after drinks and a lot of smoking last night, stopping smoking then smoking again you can really taste how bad cigarettes taste /puke

Damn addiction.

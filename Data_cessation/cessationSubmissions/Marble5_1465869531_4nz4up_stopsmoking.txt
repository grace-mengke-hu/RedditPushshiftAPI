Decided to stop smoking for good.

Hello everybody. I have just got back home from vacation at a beauty beach. While I was swimming in the ocean with everybody I realize that I was the only person struggling. I have decide that I cannot keep on going like this. So to start of my lifestyle change I have made the decision to stop smoking and get in shape. With all the money I will save from not buying cigs  I plan on buying a surfboard so I can learn how to surf. Glad I founded this subreddit, I feel like this will help me along my journey to being healthier. I will be smoking my last one tonight.

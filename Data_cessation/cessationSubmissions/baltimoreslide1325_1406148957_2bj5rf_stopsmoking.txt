Uh oh, the singing readjustments have begun. Horrible rehearsal time, hours of worst craving ever, 3 gigs coming up this weekend...

Didn't smoke though.  
Came here to vent.  
This vocal thing better resolve itself right quick. I keep reminding myself that Tom Waits, Leonard Cohen, Bob Dylan (people with low and smokey voices) all gave up smokes and no one could even tell when they made the adjustment. So it can be done. Right?! Because this f---ing sucks.  
I am going to hide in my room and think of nothing for a while...

A day late, but I did it.

Yesterday was going to be my quit day, but that didn't work out.  When I woke up this morning with hurting lungs that couldn't seem to stop coughing, and an irritated throat, I knew it was time.  My last cig was yesterday at 9:30 pm.  The cravings are not that bad. I'm easily distracted.  I didn't have reddit to amuse me last time I tried quitting. 
I just hope I don't get fat. 

Thanks for the smiley face.  Silly how a little badge on reddit can be such an incentive!

What worked for me

Hey guys and gals,
I have been off cigarettes for a long while and forgot that I was a part of this subreddit until now (which is a good thing!) so I thought I would share what helped me to quit. I enjoyed smoking and for me as long as I was preoccupied I didn't crave a cigarette or the cravings would go away quickly. After many cold turkey attempts, I found myself forgetting that I wanted a cigarette after I took up crochet. With crochet my mind was focused on the project, my hands were busy and I kept forgetting about smoking. Anyways, maybe crochet will help one of you guys as well! Best of luck, you can do it :)

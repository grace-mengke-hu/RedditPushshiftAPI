stopping tomorrow - super stressed

So I have been smoking for 12 years now besides for a 3 year break where I managed to quit when I was dating a non smoker. 
this feels like the worst time to try to quit as I have tons of things going wrong in my life  at the moment and am under a horrible amount of stress. I don't even really want to stop, I just have to as I lost my income and will have no money coming to me for anything including bills until November so cutting the habit has to happen.
I am doing this cold turkey as I cant afford smoking aids like gum or patches.. any advice on how to deal with the stress when you feel like you absolutly need a smoke?  I am in such a routine when it comes to smoking like after a meal, after a match of cs:go, anytime i go for a walk etc

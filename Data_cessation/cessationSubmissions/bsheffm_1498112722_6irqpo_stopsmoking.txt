Handling overconfidence

Hi all. My first post on Reddit but lurking on this board reading all your stories has been a real motivation so thank you. 

So I've been quit now for about five days. I feel amazing, full of energy and can literally see my body repairing all the damage I've done over the years.

My question is this. In the past I've managed to quit for months at a time, but then flushed with confidence I'll have a drag to prove I'm cured, or with a drink because I'm celebrating etc etc you know the reasons.

I just wondered if people have any strategies for dealing with these longer term issues? It's like after you've won the war, how do you win the peace? 

Thanks all

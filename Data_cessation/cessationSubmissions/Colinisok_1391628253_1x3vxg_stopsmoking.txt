60 Hours and doing great: Question For the dreamers out there

I keep a dream journal and have been attempting to lucid dream for 4 years now.

I've had a couple successful lucid dreams (one was 2 years ago the other was just a few months ago).

Last night I had a dream in which I went to a gas station, purposefully bought a cheap pack of smokes so I could just smoke a few and hate it but get my nicotine fulfillment. Then after smoking I felt guilty until my dream consciousness realized I was dreaming and the Colin sleeping hadn't smoked.

I had a lucid moment and then woke up.

How many quitters who have regular memorable night dreams have had dreams where they smoke? Did it feel the same?

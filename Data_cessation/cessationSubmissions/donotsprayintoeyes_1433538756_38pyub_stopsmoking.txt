Can't remember name/term for a (Japanese?) smoking substitute

I remember when my dad quit smoking, he had this little plastic tube that had some kind of mint coating in it. He'd breathe in through it like a cigarette. It didn't have nicotine, just that minty stuff. I've been trying to recall the name of it for years. Do any of you know what I'm talking about? I think the main selling point for this little tube is that you go through the calming deep breaths and it feels like a cigarette in your hands.

Thanks!

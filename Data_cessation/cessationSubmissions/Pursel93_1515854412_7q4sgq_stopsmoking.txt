My quitting buddy caved today...

So I'm 24, been smoking for 10+ years. My best friend is 21, he's been smoking for 4 years.

He and I decided we were going to quit one day at random. We've both been going extremely strong since. Having someone to talk to and be like "Hey man, did you cave yet? No? Okay then I wont either" really helped me for the first 3 days.

He just got a new girlfriend last night and she smokes. This morning I go on Snapchat and guess who is smoking again?

I told him I'm really disappointed, and that he's going to kick himself in the ass in 6 months when he WOULD have been 6 months clean and I still am.

I can't believe my willpower is so strong, honestly. With the support from this sub, I shall keep going strong with my non-smoking brethren!

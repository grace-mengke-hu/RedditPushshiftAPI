Starting now

I've really been screwing up this week. I've smoked like 6 cigarettes just over the last 2 days. No part of me wants to start smoking again, I just seem to keep sneaking them. But I'm already seeing where that leads and I'm not going there again. So I've started my clock back over again and starting now I'm going cold turkey and I'm gonna get myself back on track again.

It's hard not to believe the lies that cigarettes tell you when you are depressed

Hello! New to the subreddit and my last cigarette was about 18 hours ago. I'm in my late twenties and I've been smoking since my early twenties. A few years ago after dozens of tries, I was able to quit smoking. I didn't smoke for about a year, but then I started again because I was having trouble at work and also with my girlfriend. Well I thought it would help coping with them easier...

It didn't. It only made me feel more depressed and sunken into despair. Also my body started reacting by getting tired easier and having 'stuff' in my nose and throat. After years, this morning I thought about what I'm doing and how I was a fool to believe that it would help me.
I am done with smoking. I am not going to let it take me deeper. I will fight with it and start taking control of my life, one step at a time.

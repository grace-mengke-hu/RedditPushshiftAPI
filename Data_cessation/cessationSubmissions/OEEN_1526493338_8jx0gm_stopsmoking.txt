500 Days Free

I stopped smoking the first of January of 2017 cold turkey and didn't smoke 1 since. 


The first 6 weeks I had a massive brain fog and a lot of anger issues in the first week but after that it went better and better and now weeks pass without thinking of smoking.
But I know from past attempts of quiting I can't just take one, I still like the smell of a fresh lit cigaret.


I gained about 30 pounds last year, I substitued snacking for smoking.
Recently started with CICO and logging my food on mfp and now 10 pounds left to go.

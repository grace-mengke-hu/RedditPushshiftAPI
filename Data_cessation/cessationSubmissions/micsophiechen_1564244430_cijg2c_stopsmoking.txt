1 month mark is near and now I have a question

Hello community,

Tomorrow I will complete 1 month without smoking a single cigarette and I have never been so proud of myself. Now today I am invited to a party. The smokers around there won't bother me I guess. Ive been around smokers and it was always OK with me. But I am thinking about having a drink and I am not sure if this will get me craving. How was it with you guys? When did you start to drink again or was this not a problem? I want to join the party and it would be no problem if I don't drink there, but I really want to do it someday again. I am interested in your experiences. (sorry f√ºr bad Englisch)

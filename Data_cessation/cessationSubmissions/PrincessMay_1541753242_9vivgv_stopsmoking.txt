3 days smoke free!

I can’t believe I’ve made it! Me! A secret pack a day smoker. I was openly smoking but lying to everyone including myself about how much I was smoking. How embarrassing. I’ve made it to 3 days, so that means most of the nicotine should be gone. 

I’ve had the worst cravings today but I’ve pushed through because I know at this stage it’s all in my head. 

Thanks for reading.

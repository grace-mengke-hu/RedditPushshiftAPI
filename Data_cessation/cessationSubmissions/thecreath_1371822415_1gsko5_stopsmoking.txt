4 days of non smoking of attempt number 15!!

I have smoked for 17 years and in that time have made many attempts to stop. 6 months has been the longest I have gone without smoking. Every attempt has failed because of one thing ..... Alcohol!!!
I would always have done really well then on a night out while drinking I would decide to just have one cigarette and that would lead to me smoking again.
I have now stopped smoking for over 4 days and I feel very good if a little bit edgy! This attempt will be a success!!!

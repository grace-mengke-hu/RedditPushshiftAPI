Didn't quit on the 1st even though you wanted to? Think it's too late now to bother? I quit one year ago today with my girlfriend. We haven't smoke once since then, except in dreams. We are non -smokers now, and you can be, too. 

I was desperate to quit a year ago when my girlfriend came to me on January 3rd and said she thought she would stop the next day. I said, "OK," and that was that. 

I smoked about a pack a day for about 17 years before that. It hasn't always been easy, and this was a trying year, to be sure, but I quit. I quit, and you can too.

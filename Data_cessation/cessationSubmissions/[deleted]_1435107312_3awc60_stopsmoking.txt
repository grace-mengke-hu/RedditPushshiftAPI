I just realized it's been 35 days! Longest ever for me!

I'm so happy. I hadn't realized how long it's been because I rarely go on Reddit on my computer (so I can't see my badge) and I rarely go on my app, except when I have an extreme craving. But I haven't been this long without a cigarette since I started smoking at 13! 

I quit cold turkey, and I haven't had any major cravings since about two weeks in. I get dull headaches when I'm stressed, but that's about it. I totally recommend this random Australian government app called My QuitBuddy, it's nice!

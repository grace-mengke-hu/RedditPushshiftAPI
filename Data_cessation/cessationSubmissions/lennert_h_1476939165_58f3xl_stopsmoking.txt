D24 and about to give up

It's hard... I haven't smoked in 24 days. I'm glad I didn't. 
But now, I really need a smoke. So much is happening right now. Having trouble getting a loan for the house. With those possible charges for cancelation of our offer on the house. 

I know a cigarette won't solve those problems, but boy, I crave it. I really hope I don't smoke today.

Looking for a sponsor

Hello r/stop smoking!

So I've been reading info on this subreddit for the past few weeks, just lurking, but I feel ready to quit. I bought an e cig, to occupy myself at break time at work, and although I haven't started reading it yet, I have Allan Carr's book downloaded onto my phone. 

Now, the next part of my post may be a bit peculiar, but please hear me out! One of the things I'm most looking forward to is getting my sense of smell back, and as a reminder of that, as well as some motivation, I was looking for a lady to sponsor me by letting me smell her feet once a week for every week I'm smoke free. 

I know it's an odd request but I'm looking for anything that might help! 

Thanks for reading, and any other advice or suggestions are welcomed and appreciated!

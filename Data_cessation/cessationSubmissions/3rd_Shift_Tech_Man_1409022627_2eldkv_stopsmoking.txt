I'm having my last smoke in a few minutes...

I've been in and out of this sub for about a year now.  Some of you guys and gals are an inspiration!

I've dabbled in quitting quite a few times.  I've gone a few months, then relapsed.  Then a couple of weeks, then relapsed.  I've learned that it is so easy for me to make excuses to get this nasty habit back and walk down that smokey path.

I feel ashamed on many levels.  The biggest level is the lie I've been telling people.  Most think I quit a long time ago, but I've been hiding it from them because of the shame.  My SO thought I quit almost a year ago, but then I started sneaking a few in at work and not smoking whenever she was around.  Now that we live together, there is definitely no way I can continue this charade.

I also got to play with my two young nieces this weekend and I realized that after about 20-30 minutes of being a human jungle gym for them, I was out of breath and exhausted.  I plan on having children of my own one day and I don't want to deny them their playtime with Daddy.  

This is it.  This is the time.  It's now or never.  I'm doing this not only for me, but for those I care about.  Each cigarette not smoked is extra time I have with friends and family.

Cigarettes, you're a cruel bitch, but I got your number.  Be prepared to be out of my life forever!

***EDIT*** - Last cigarette down.  My lighter I keep "as a spare" at work is in the big trash receptacle.  I don't have any in my car or at home.  It's show time.

I'm at the point where these things taste awful.

I've always said I could quit any time, I just didn't want to. I always believed this was true, until I decided to try to put them down. I set and failed to meet more goals than I care to tally. Slowly but surely, I've been growing further away from being a smoker. It's little things for now. I don't smoke with my kids in the car as it is, so I'm cutting out smoking in the car altogether. I'm shopping for a new car anyway, so the prospect of 'new car smell' vs the tar and ash smell should be enough to keep me true to my word. I already go outside to smoke, which is becoming a major annoyance. I feel like this has caused me to cut back a bit all on its own. I hate the smell, I hate the taste, I hate wasting my money, I hate how sick they make me feel. Yet I sit, typing this, cigarette in hand. 


How do I get my head in the game? It's like I'm working against myself.

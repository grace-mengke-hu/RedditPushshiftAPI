It felt amazing to be drunk and not have a craving.  Did not think it was possible.

I got really drunk this weekend, Friday to be exact.  I was really afraid that I'd be fighting cravings all night.  Some time during the night, I realized: Holy shit... I don't feel any cravings.  Nothing!  The only thing I felt was... well, drunk!

I didn't think it was possible.  Years and years of doing one with the other, and I never thought I could enjoy alcohol without feeling that crave monkey on my back.

Well, friends, I assure you, IT'S POSSIBLE!  Give it a month, and I promise you'll feel the same.

Good luck everyone, keep on keepin' on.

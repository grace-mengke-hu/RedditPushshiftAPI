Hi r/stopsmoking I am to the point where I am going to take up smoking to guilt another into quitting. Does this sound like the dumbest idea in the world to you?

My mother has been an avid smoker ever since I was young. Here I am 20 years old, still reminding her of the time I was 6 and she promised me she'd stop smoking...

I've heard all types of excuses, all types of "oh next month I won't be so stressed so then I can quit" sorta bullshit. 

Now her new boyfriend that she lives with is a smoker, her best friend is a smoker. And I simply don't care that shes surrounded by smokers, that makes it a thousand times harder, I know. But she needs to stop. 

I'm not posting this for the inevitable "you cant control people" comments. I don't want them here. So move on.

Its a strange feeling watching someone you love kill themselves slowly each day

Anyway, to my plan. She dreads the fact of me taking up smoking (ironic, right?) So my mission is to become fullheartedly addicted to this shit in a month. Then bam, quit after the 30th day immediately, cold turkey to prove to her it can be done without delays/excuses/"opportunities". 

The idea is that I tell her I quit as soon as she does. If she doesn't I show her it can be done. 

Questions/comments/ideas/input?

...
What I need is info on
-How often do I smoke in 30 days to become addicted
-How will this affect my health short/long term?
-Is it a bad idea based only on the possibility I won't be able to quit?

I've quit smoking and vaping cold turkey for a little over a month now!

Though I feel free and not so light headed, I am still facing some problems. I wanted to see if anyone else is suffering is has suffered through this.

Right now I still feel short of breathe when carrying out mundane tasks. Going upstairs, holding groceries, etc. Keep in my that I'm not out of shape, this being out of breathe feeling is way heavier than anything I've felt before. There's even a wheezing sound sometimes when I breathe in. I just feel like there's this heavy weight against my chest and airways sometimes. Mucus has been coughed up a lot, but it won't leave fast enough.

Has anyone felt this terrible feeling upon quitting? Should I see a doctor if it doesn't go away? Thanks and god bless this community!

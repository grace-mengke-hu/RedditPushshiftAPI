Dear ciggarettes

It's hard for me to say this, but it's time for us to move on. You came into my life when I was at my lowest point. I was suicidal, had no hopes for my life, confused, depressed, and hurt. But now 5 years later I don't need you anymore. I've grown as a man, I've learned lots of things, I conquered my depression, I found love, and myself, and I have to keep growing and developing as a person. Unfortunately ciggarettes cause me too much harm, and are not beneficial to me or my life goals. So this is my goodbye ciggarettes. Thanks for ruining my health, and holding me back in life.

I’m a non smoker now

Hi guys. Used to be a big Allen Carr fan. Would read his book many times and stop and start smoking all the time. Doing this is very draining and self destructive. So I just smoked and gave up trying.

But today I was sun baking and thought sick at the thought of the next cigarette. So I didn’t have one. Then I decided to have my final smoke. I didn’t even finish it all I got rid of it and vowed not to have another.

Truth is Allen Carr doesn’t use scare tactics but people like me who are fanatics of his technique lose their fear of smoking.... I did. I became numb to the reality that smoking was doing all these bad things to me. Like shortness of breath. Dying for air is not a nice way to live or die.

The worst part of smoking is the warping of the mind, you search for any excuse to continue smoking. - my fav Allen Carr line

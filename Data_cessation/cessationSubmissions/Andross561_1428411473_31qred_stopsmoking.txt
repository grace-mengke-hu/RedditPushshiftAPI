It's been a month!

Wow I can't believe it's been 30 days. Waiting for this day made me feel like a kid waiting impatiently for that new toy. 

I've noticed that I hardly think about cigarettes when I go on long walks anymore, which is when I used to always smoke. I've been able to drink with my smoker friends without succumbing to the almighty nicotine god. All in all its amazing what 30 days without the death sticks can do. I breathe easier, taste better and am happier. 

I used to think cigarettes helped me be happy and cope with stress, but the joy of knowing I'm not a smoker has helped me overcome stress more than smoking ever did. Cheers all! Let us not smoke today :)

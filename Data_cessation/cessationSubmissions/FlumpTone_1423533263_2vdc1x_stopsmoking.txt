Just over 2 weeks.

And I owe it to discipline, cold showers, my vape pen, and support from those close to me.  I feel much better, it's easy being a non smoker with my awesome vape pen. I bought an ipv 3 with a kanger subtank and it is always ready to go when I want it.  The trick for me will be using it when I want to, and not when my nicotine levels insist.  Whatever your method, keep on keepin on.

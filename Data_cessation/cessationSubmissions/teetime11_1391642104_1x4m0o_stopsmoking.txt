Today is my last Day 1!

I've tried several times before, made it a while, weeks sometimes, and always broken down on a real bad day or drunk out with old College friends and then was right back in it. All the past times were purely through attempted self-control. I decided to come to this sub to try and get some long term motivation and advice as well as books and other help to really quit long-term.

To 450 days and beyond

I hit the 450 days mark

I had many failures with quitting .. usually i will cave in 30 days to few days and weeks.

It feels like i quit it yesterday .., 
I do get the thought to hold them between my lips and have a puff and blow out.

.. i feel it has increased its in the past few months may be it is linked to my weird sleeping habits and depression
but i am not caving in ...

stay strong people you got this Put your head down and march towards your goal
It starts with you quitting and then weeks will become months, months will become [years](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlM4QWlvDzo)

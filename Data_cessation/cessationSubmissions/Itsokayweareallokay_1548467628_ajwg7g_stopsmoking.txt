5 months nicotine-free, how do I relearn time management?

I smoked for almost ten years from about 13-14 y.o. to 23. I quit smoking 6-17-18, and used nicotine patches for the next two months. At the end of August, I got sick and dropped the patches. Since then it's been almost 5 months without nicotine, and over 7 months without cigarettes. 

I've had many ups and downs that I know are normal. In the beginning I was  out-of-it most days, having that "just woke up" nicotine withdrawal funk, but it was manageable with willpower, a change in scenery (I moved over the summer), and keeping myself busy. I also ate more processed snack foods at first, and still do, but now I mix in more fruits and veggies, and try to always have Altoids on me but I'm sort of relying less on the mints. I still have that funk these days but it seems to have gotten less noticeable over the months.

During the middle months I dealt with fatigue, no motivation to do any schoolwork, and some brief bouts of depression, but I still haven't smoked. 

(TL;DR:) I'm at this point now where I'm nearing 5 months nicotine-free, and I am having more serious cravings than I was during the first few months. I still am having trouble finding motivation for any schoolwork and procrastinate like crazy (I procrastinated before but its never been this bad). I am just wondering if anyone else had this trouble and if they made it through to relearn how to manage their time without cigarettes as a reward system, a motivator to wake up, a motivator to do homework, etc. 

Basically, I'd like to know what has worked for you all to get you back on track with time management and motivation?

Thank you all in advance.

Need to stop before I'm hooked.

So I started smoking again a few weeks ago for various reasons, mostly stress related. I enjoy it and the release I get. However I ended up unexpectedly seeing my SO after a tough shift on Saturday and when we got into bed she dropped this on me:

"You don't smell like you. You never smell like you anymore."

Many feels were had and it's the best motivation I have to stop.

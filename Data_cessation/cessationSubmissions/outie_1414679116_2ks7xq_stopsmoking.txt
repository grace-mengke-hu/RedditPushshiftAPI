I'm terrified of going it alone.

TL;DR I feel like I'll be alienated and alone if I quit and can't get my smoking friends to quit. 

My biggest fear is that I'm afraid I won't be able to do this alone without someone to talk to who really truly understands what I'm going through. I quit a year ago for about 4 days and I don't remember in the slightest what that was like, but it must not have been pleasant. I just finished the easy way to stop smoking by Allen Carr and I had a huge confidence boost and decided to commit.

 All of my family except my dad are happy non-smokers. My dad is one of the strongest men I know and he's tried every method imaginable to quit and he still smokes!

On top of that I'm surrounded by friends/coworkers who smoke and really seem like cool, classy people who enjoy their cigarettes the way I do. They're fun to be around and I like hanging out with them and really its difficult to avoid them.

I've asked two of my coworkers I'm more close with and while they support my decision to quit they have no desire to quit themselves. I almost get the feeling they're being nice right now but may get annoyed at hearing my struggle in the weeks to come.

What can I do as far as personal support outside of my non smoking family and faraway strangers on reddit?

Update: 2 of my friends have decided to quit with me.
lets hope we all stick it out together!!!
I've smoked my last cigarette. and nailed it up on the wall to remind me that it was my last, in all its disgusting glory.

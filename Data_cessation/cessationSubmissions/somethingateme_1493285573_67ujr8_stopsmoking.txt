Le Sigh

Went on a vacation to Amsterdam.  Didn't know the pre-rolled joints were mixed with tobacco.  After 3+ years, I have had to reset my counter.  I also went out with a real one.  My wife said the tobacco in the joints counted as a reason to reset.  So after our last night out, I bummed a smoke from a fellow bar patron and smoked my last real cigeratte.  At least it wasn't a pack, and I'm pretty sure I'll be back to 1153 days in 1150 more days.  

I don't feel discouraged, just upset that I didn't ask enough questions.  Live and learn I guess.

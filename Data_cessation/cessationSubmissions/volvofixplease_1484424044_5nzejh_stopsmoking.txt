I have been quit for around two years(smoked around 200 cigarettes in that period of time, mostly whenever drunk) did anyone else notice how there are periods in your day in which you just feel relaxed?

When I was a smoker I would always feel so tense, now I do I feel tense sometimes without smoking but the fact of the matter is, I can relax, wholeheardedly relax for real. Anyone else?

30Days .. Holy man!

I made it a whole 30 days without a take, I think the best part has been the last 5 days, where I didn't hav the help of a patch at all. I'm up a few lbs, but I feel a lot better, and can actually go on the treadmill and not worry about wheezing nonstop. 

lets see if I can go 30 more!

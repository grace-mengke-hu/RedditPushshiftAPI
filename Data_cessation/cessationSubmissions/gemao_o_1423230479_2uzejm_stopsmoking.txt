I slipped up last night...

So we had an accident at home where my boyfriend accidentally stabbed himself in the thigh... After making sure he was okay, we went straight to the gas station, bought a pack of cigarettes and smoked one each.

The worst bit about having that cigarette last night wasn't anything to do with being upset that I broke my streak... It was that it tasted so disgusting that I was appalled I'd ever smoked in the first place. 
Really glad that I quit, I can't ever remember why I thought cigarettes tasted amazing!

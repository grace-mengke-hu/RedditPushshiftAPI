Third week DONE

So I'm just over three weeks now and it's getting easier and easier. I still get cravings everyday but they're nothing like the first few days, more like "I would smoke one if I had them" but it quickly turns into a "no way, not worth it, nope".

Just yesterday was the first time I had some friends over at my house since I quit. It was easy, even though I still had to fight the cravings and I think I ate more than I wanted. The thing is: when they were about to leave I noticed someone had left a pack on the coffee table. I rushed to see if it had cigarettes thinking that if there were some cigs there I should find out whose they were and give them back, under no circumstances they should've stayed there. 

There were no cigarettes but I found it kind of scary that I thought "if there are cigarettes in my house I *will* smoke them". On the other hand I was glad that my first instinct was actually: "If there are cigarettes there I need to get rid of them ASAP". 

So that's it. To all of you just starting or even just thinking about quitting let me tell you: it is definitely easier than it looks like during the first few days, the cravings after that first week are just not the same. KEEP IT UP! You can do this.

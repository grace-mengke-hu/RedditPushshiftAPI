I forgot how uncomfortable quitting can be (moaning about withdrawal)!

I have done this all before.

About 8 years ago I quit for just over 9 months, cold-turkey. I shamefully started up again, blaming every possible person, place or thing for me being weak. I did take some days off so that my students wouldn't be exposed to the raging monster that is me in withdrawal.

At some point last year, I "quit" for a *very* short time. While it didn't last long, I did *mean* to quit when I made the decision. But people, places and things can be a bitch.

So okay - 3rd time is supposed to be the charm, right? I willfully and purposely took my last puff on Sunday night, about 9:45 PM. I'm tired of feeling the tightness in my chest after a smoke. I'm tired of "the morning smoker's cough".

I bought an e-cig set and am using that - but I want to stress that **I am not using any nicotine in my e-cig whatsoever**. The sets with nicotine are *illegal* here, so all I am getting is a little puff of vapor and a pleasant taste in my mouth.

Yesterday was absolutely horrible, as I expected it would be. Today is the same, perhaps a little worse.

* I am swinging from pissed off at the world to ready to cry at the drop of a hat. I did take some days off work so that my students  right nowl.
* I'm bored. *Sooooooooo* bored and restless.
* I'm gassy and well... I'm on the toilet *a lot*.
* I have a slight headache. It is *constant*, but more irritating than painful.
* I can't focus on anything. Not only do I feel a little dizzy, my mind is full of cobwebs so that I am experiencing everything as though I am looking through a foggy room.

I'd go out on a walk, but I am terrified that I will end up walking behind someone who is having a smoke. Right now I don't feel ready for that, and haven't even gone outside since Sunday night.

I don't remember my first long-term quit, so all of these withdrawal symptoms are like new for me. 

I feel a little lonely and vulnerable right now, so I'd just like to get some positive reinforcement that these side effects are soon over.

If anyone has anything to contribute, I'd love to hear it. Thanks in advance!

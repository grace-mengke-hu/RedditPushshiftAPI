Here it goes

It's been 10 years I've been smoking. I'm going to turn 26 soon. And a few months after that it will be 11 years smoking. I've been smoking a pack-a pack and a half for the past 5 of these 10.

The past few months I look in the mirror and think to myself "huh, small crows feet are forming at my eyes, when did that happen." Or "wow 2 flights of steps and I have to breathe through my mouth I'm so winded." And "when did these lines form between my nose and mouth? I wonder if my hair would be thinning out this badly if I never smoked? I look like I'm at least 30 not 26."

I don't know if I'd look more my age if I never smoked, but I know it sure as hell isn't helping. More and more I'm gripped with the fear that I truly, *truly* am speeding my way towards the grave with all these cigarettes. I can't keep doing this to myself. I can't even afford this! $180 a month? Jesus I only have a HS diploma and a mediocre paying job. $180? That's serious cash for me. I don't want to end up like my grandma. COPD/Emphysema and she still smoked. Double bypass surgery, and she still smoked. Then she had a stroke and it killed her. And that's the path I'm on. Even if I'm lucky enough to live until my 60s it will be connected to an O2 tank and unable to be on my feet for more than an hour without having to lay down from exhaustion.

I have to this now before I am old and sick with nothing but these goddamn cigarettes and regret.

I'm so scared to lose this battle.

My journey

2 months ago I stopped speeding. With stims it's easy to get hooked but you reach rock bottom pretty fast and you know it's time to quit. 
I also started nofap and have lowered the amount of faps to almost 2-3 in those 2 months.
I have also lowered the amount of weed I smoke.
2 weeks ago I quit smoking cigs, which has been the hardest of all. Damn, maybe it is a combination of all the other things that I am quitting, but I feel depressed as shit. I constantly want to smoke. The only thing that's keeping me from smoking is that I know that 1 cigarette won't be enough. To relieve the pressure I have, I would need to smoke at least a pack in the next 10 hours. So it's either continue suffering or start smoking again. If I smoke only 1 cigarette and I manage to not smoke more, I wouldn't feel better. 1 cigarette is not enough, I need way more to feel better.

I really feel shit and need some help. Stress at work and visiting hospitals, because of family members getting very sick is not helping at all. 
Also I am very lonely, because I managed to fuck up all my social relations with other people during the time I was high on dopamine. I am trying my hardest.

I know that a comment, which states something like "don't worry, it will pass" or "you are strong, keep going" would NOT help me at all,   but I don't know what would make me feel better.

I am sorry for being such a bitch.

Also, nobody knows about all that shit, so I have to hide it from my family and also I have to appear strong and in control at work.

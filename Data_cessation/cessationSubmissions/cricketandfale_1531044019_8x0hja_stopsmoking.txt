Will I go into withdrawal again?!

Hey folks! 7 weeks smoke free here and very pleased to have put smoking behind me for good. 

Unfortunately got quite drunk yesterday (it's coming home!!!) and had two puffs on something I shouldn't have if you catch my drift. Obviously this wasn't a full cigarette but is it going to put me back in to withdrawl? I'm worried about having to go through it again... 

No real urge to smoke cigarettes or otherwise, just a drunk blip/reflex. Drunk me wasn't really thinking about what I was being passed.

Attn College students of r/stopsmoking: it can be done

It can be done  
  
February 23, 2013. Cold turkey day. The day I quit smoking all tobacco and have yet to relapse. And guess what: after all that day counting, month counting, milestone counting, **I forgot on July 23 that it was my 5 months clean day.** Totally forgot, didn't realize until today. And it feels fantastic.  
  
I was (and still am) not just a social drinker. I go to UCSB, one of the most well-known party schools in the country. This is [Halloween](http://thebottomline.as.ucsb.edu/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/322995_2578967994569_1265464458_33025195_1242136671_o1-1024x682.jpg). This is [Floatopia](http://www.philzone.org/discus/messages/816174/809206.jpg). I loved smoking cigarettes while out partying:the rush, the social aspect, meeting girls bumming cigs, stepping outside for fresh air. I was hooked on smoking while drinking.  
*It can be done.*  
  
I used to smoke mole bowls whenever I would burn, sometimes multiple times a day.  
*It can be done.*  
  
I loved hookah. My roommate last summer had a 6 foot hookah with 4 hoses. We would have hookah nights multiple times a week, with anywhere from 4-20 people over smoking bowl after citrusy bowl and blowing smoke rings.  
*It can be done.*  
  
I go to shows and have seen DJs like Hardwell, Zedd, Laidback Luke, Wolfgang Gartner, the list goes on. I would bring in an unopened pack and smoke anywhere from 3/4 to a full pack just during my activities during the show.  
*It can be done.*  
  
I probably 'quit' over a hundred times, running out of cigs and swearing I wouldn't go buy another pack only to convince myself 'hey its friday' or 'there's this party I want to go to and I don't want to be uncomfortable.' I must have bummed another hundred cigs off of random people at parties AFTER I had supposedly quit.  
*It can be done.*  
  
I studied abroad in Europe where smoking is in some parts the norm and not the exception. If I thought I found fellow smokers and non-judgmental times here at college, Europe was a whole new ballgame. There might be as many people outside on the roof of the club smoking and bumming as on the dance floor.  
*It can be done.*  
  
Point being not that I'm some God of party or a one-of-a-kind success story but that you can do this too!! Don't let yourself make excuses about it being college and it's just fun and in the now or that it can't be done because you like to drink and drinking is a trigger.  
  
Because frankly, I shouldn't be the one standing here saying I quit. You should be. And you know what? You fuckin' will be dude.  
*It can be done.*

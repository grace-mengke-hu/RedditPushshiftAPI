no smoking is good for me.

hi,

i tried to not smoke many many many times. usually, a few days is never a problem. a week as well. but somehow i end up somking in the end. my feeling is also smoking gets havier, when returning to the habbit. 

my new girlfriend does not know that i smoke. i only smoke at work, or out with friends. before i meet her, i take a shower.

this time i did not smoke for 3 days. i want it to be a serious start. on thursday i will be at a meeting with some business friends. they all smoke a lot. this will be the first big trigger.

all good luck to other quiters. we can do it!

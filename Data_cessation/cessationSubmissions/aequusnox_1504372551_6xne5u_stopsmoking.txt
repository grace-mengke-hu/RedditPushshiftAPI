I can't taste anything, I keep crying. All I want is a cigarette. I know it won't make me happy but it would at least calm me down.

I know I can't smoke anymore. In the past I didn't care but I want to live a long time for my fiance. I don't want to die at 40 and leave her alone but this is so painful. Every time I buy a new pack of cigarettes I tell myself I'm quitting after this. Well my last pack expired Thursday and now it's Saturday. I keep crying, I can't taste food (it all tastes the same to me). I started Wellbutrin XL 150mg on Monday, and like every addict, I'm trying to justify buying a pack of cigarettes by saying, "Well, the Wellbutrin needs more time to kick in. And what if I buy a shitty pack? It'll taste gross and and ward me off further from this disgusting habit."

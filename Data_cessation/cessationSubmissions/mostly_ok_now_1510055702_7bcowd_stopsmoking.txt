Just smoked my last one, for real this time.

I quit for about a week, but my anxiety was out of control, so I've been smoking again for the last two weeks. I'm seeing my psychiatrist today to see what we can do to help with my anxiety. I have no reason to smoke, and a million reasons not to. I just need to get through work today. Kind of feel like crying thinking about it, but I know that smoking is not doing a damn thing to help with my anxiety. 

I don't want to smoke, but I feel like the biggest reasons are pressure from people around me to quit. They honestly make me feel like garbage, even though their intentions are good. Any tips on bringing the focus back to quitting just for myself?

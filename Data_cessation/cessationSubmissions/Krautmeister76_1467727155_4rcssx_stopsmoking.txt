Quit on July 1, 2016 - Got to make it stick this time!

First time on reddit for anything. I heard that this is a good support group for those seeking assistance and the occasional pick-me-up on the quest to a smoke-free life, so here I am. Been quite for 5 days now, and it's mostly going ok, but part of me really wants a smoke, even though I know that I cannot have even one puff/ drag.

20 minutes ago

20 minutes ago i threw my pack of cigarettes and lighter in my works dumpster.
20 minutes ago i decided to change my life.
Im 23 and will be 24 on November 11. Ive been smoking since i was 15. Lived in a home full of smokers my entire life. Always told myself i would never smoke like my parents. Then my older brother started and i followed.
I remember on my 18th birthday at midnight i was at the gas station buying my first legal pack of cigarettes, god i was so happy.
I love everything about it. As soon as im dont with a cigarette im already thinking about when my next one will be.
Ive tried quitting many times before but this time is different. Im flooded with emotions this time. I can feel the want to stop now.
I have 2 more unopened packs at home. Id like to keep them as a reminder of the last 2 packs i ever bought.
Everytime ive tried before i never made it past 12 hours.

To all you beautiful strangers, keep fighting the good fight. 
Im Dodgenickson and this is day 1.

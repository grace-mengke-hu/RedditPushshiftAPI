Nicotine free for 4 months after 5 years smoking - happy to give advice!

I started smoking at 16 and shortly after turning 21, I decided enough was enough and after a number of unsuccessful attempts to quit, I'm finally nicotine free! If anyone would like my take on how to quit for good, feel free to drop me a message! Look forward to hearing from you!

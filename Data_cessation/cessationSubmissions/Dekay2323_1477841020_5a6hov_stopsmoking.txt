Stopping smoking tomorrow

Yeah I know -1 day in. I have quite before, up to 8 months. I have tried slowing down to 1 a day, that never worked. But I quit tomorrow. The reason tomorrow is I start a new job, and I plan to never ever smoke there, and been quitting on and off most of this year.

Here goes!

Day 1

Today is the day I make an actual effort to quit.  I am not a heavy smoker, maybe 1-2 packs a week, but I can never go more than a day or two without a cigarette.  I find myself hiding my smoking from everyone, which to say the least, is exhausting.  I have started to feel physical effects of smoking, and want to stop while a recovery from this is easier than it will be later.  Through many half-assed attempts to quit, this is my first try at deliberately putting them down, holding myself accountable, and not taking any more minutes off my life with a tube of paper filled with chemicals.  Cheers to you all, some of your stories are truly inspiring!

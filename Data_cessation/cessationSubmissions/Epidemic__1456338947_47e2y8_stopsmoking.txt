Day 1 of quitting...

I'm a 17 year old dude who's smoked for a good year. Now I get sick, and the first three colors of the rainbow, and many more come out. I'm sick of it, also if anyone knows if coughing brown phlegm is bad do tell I don't want to waste a trip to the doctors. But anyways I'm gonna quit smoking because I don't feel like dying, or COPD, or cancer, or all that other stuff. Because deep down, that's scary as hell. Thanks for reading ladies and gents, I'll document how uncomfortable the whole event is.

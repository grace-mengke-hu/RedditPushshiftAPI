Anyone else experience this?

Hey guys.

So I quit on Friday and the quit is going well. Managed to make it past my first weekend without too many problems.

Anyways, I'm having trouble sleeping. The reason I quit was because I was being kept up at night with palpitations and a sore left shoulder. Funny thing is, now it's gotten worse. It's 6am here and I have to be up for work at 8am. I think altogether I've gotten less than 10 hours sleep total in the last 4 nights.

Anyone else experience this during their quit?

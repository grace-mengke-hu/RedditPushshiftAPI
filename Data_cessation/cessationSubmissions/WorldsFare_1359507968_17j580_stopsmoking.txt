Holy Hell make it stop!

I am close to day 3 of quitting. I feel like I am almost over the hump and I have done a good job of avoiding temptation. I have been busy with school, getting paperwork ready for a new house, and school. I haven't had time to notice that my wife is still smoking, I actually forgot about it. Now today...I come home from running and she is lighting one up, I want to kick a baby I want one so badly.

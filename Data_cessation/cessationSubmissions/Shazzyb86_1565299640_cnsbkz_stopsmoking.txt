Im new to this site. So this is my second attempt giving up smoking, problem was I enjoyed it for many years &amp; now I want to try for a baby so I need to kick this is the ass before hand. Im using NRT which is helping but the craving after dinner is the worst. Any tips are most welcome. Wish me luck

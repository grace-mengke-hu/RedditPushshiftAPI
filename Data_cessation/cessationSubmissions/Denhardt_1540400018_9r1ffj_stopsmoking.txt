Day 3 without cigarettes: I will drowsy, slightly depressed even, and not in the mood of doing things I used to enjoy

Is this my life now?

I used to come home from work full of energy to play video games late into the night until 1 AM or so. I also had plenty of energy during the day.

It's all gone now that I've quit. I'm drowsy all day. Video games aren't exciting anymore. My mood is crap. I feel slightly depressed for no reason.

Has anyone experienced this before? Does it go away??

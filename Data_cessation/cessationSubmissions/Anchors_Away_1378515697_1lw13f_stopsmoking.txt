I'm 24 hours without smoking, but already close to giving up

I literally found this subreddit 2 minutes ago, thank god you guys are here! I've been smoking for 6 years and finally ready to quit. I have PCOS and am trying to regulate it, but I can't get birth control to help until my blood pressure is under control, and my smoking is making it worse. I'm self destructive though, I know my health and potentially fertility depend on it, but I'm currently standing by my front door getting ready to walk to the local convenience store to buy a pack.

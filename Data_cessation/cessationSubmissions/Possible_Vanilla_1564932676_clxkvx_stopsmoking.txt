How do I help someone who wants to quit?

Obligatory mobile formatting warning. 

My BF has wanted to quit smoking for a long time now. So, we decided together that he would quit cold turkey on August 2nd. I suggested maybe trying to taper it, but he wanted to go for it fully. He gave me his last pack of cigarettes to hide for emergencies. 

Although I know it’s only been 3 days, he has asked me for cigarettes/asked if it was ok to smoke everyday (including this morning) from his emergency pack. I told him that he should try using his hard candies, but he responded that he seriously needs them because he’s getting tremors. I have given in every time and feel bad about it, but I don’t control him. He has only asked for a couple a day so far, but I’m scared that if I continue to give in, it’ll become more than just a couple. 

What is the best way for me to help? I don’t want to be too negative, but I also don’t want to be a pushover and be taken advantage of. He asked for my help. I know that this is a long process, and I’m fully aware that my actions have the ability to make or break his success. So, I want to hear from the perspective of others wanting to quit. Any advice for me? Should I continue to give in and give him a couple cigarettes or hold my ground?

Was at a concert at the State Fair today and there were so many people smoking..

It made me crave a cigarette soo bad. I really wondered if I would fail today but I am happy to say I pushed through! Also seeing all the people smoking while pushing their babies in strollers made me more motivated not to give in because I don't want to be THAT parent (I'm pregnant with my first right now).

I'm shocked and proud at the same time 🚭😁

I do think the day's are really getting better as for as wanting to  smoke I mean I still have a thought about asking for one . I'm shocked that it goes away quickly and  Today at lunch a coworker sit beside me who just came in from smoking I almost got sick from the way it smelled I never thought of it that way until now sense I'm a nonsmoker very happy that I can say  I Am A NONSMOKER. And day 17  has come .

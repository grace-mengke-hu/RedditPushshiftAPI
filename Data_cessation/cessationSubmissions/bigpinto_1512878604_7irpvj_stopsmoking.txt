How to clean lungs after quitting smoking

Now that I am "not a single puff â„¢" smoke free for 50 days, I am wondering how I can clean lungs.

What is medically proven to clean lungs after quitting smoking? Steam inhalation?

I have been taking multi-vitamins regularly since I quit smoking, so don't want to take any other crap like honey, turmeric, green tea, etc (bar-b-que is ok).

I have also started walking and planning to start doing brisk walking jogging etc for exercise.

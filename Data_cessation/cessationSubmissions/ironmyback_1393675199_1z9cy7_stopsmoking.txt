Day 2

Feeling a bit spaced out, blood sugar levels seen a tad low but then again I did go gym last night and ate a thousand calorie meal afterwards. And I had a good 10 hour sleep lol. 

Anyway, each time a think of a cigarette, I just say no. Not really craving one but I guess it's the one thing missing from my daily routine. 

Busy day today, so doubt I'll be able to find time to smoke lol. 

Hopefully by the end of tomorrow there will be no nicotine in my system.

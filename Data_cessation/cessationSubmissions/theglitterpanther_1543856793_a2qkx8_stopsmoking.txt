Has anyone replaced smoking with exercise?

After a several attempts to quit, I have decided to do some yoga. When I lit up this morning, my chest got heavy and I started coughing non-stop. So, I re-set my app to today, and I hope it sticks this time! Every time I get a craving, I will go run around the block. Has exercise saved anyone else from smoking? 

Please wish me luck guys!

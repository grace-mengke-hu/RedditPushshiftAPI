Day 4 without cigarettes, cravings are strong.

Day 4 without a cigarette, didn’t intentionally try to quit, just ran out on my pack and haven’t smoke since, I don’t know if it’s the nicotine or whatnot but Ive been having really bad aches, cold sweats and heart beating fast,numbness in my feet and fingers, I’m just wondering if it’s normal to experience after stopping?

I'm 26, I got my wisdom teeth out yesterday (plus two others) and I haven't had a cigarette in 24 hours.

It's hard but I feel like the worst part is over. I had my last cig on the way to the dentist yesterday. I smoked 1.5+ packs a day for the past 5 years. It's part of the reason my wisdom teeth and 2 molars needed to come out. But despite my mouth being filled with blood, I woke up breathing better than I have in years. I can't wait for every day to get better. I cant wait to have the extra 70 bucks a week to live more comfortably. 

Also, getting dry sockets scares the shit out of me.

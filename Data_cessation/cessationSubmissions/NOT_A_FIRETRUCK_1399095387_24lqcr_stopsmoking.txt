Since my setback I've been smoking. It's time to stop letting smoking win. I'm doing this. Day 0 begins now.

The other day I posted about having a setback. Well... I've been smoking since. I kept coming up with excuses, "works too stressful to be back on days 1-3 with." I was planning on waiting until Monday when I have 2 days off work. But then I realized, there will ALWAYS be something that will come up. I can't make excuses anymore. I know I want to do this and I know I CAN do this. I made it 6 days previously and I can do it again. I'm moving a friend tomorrow and that's quite stressful but it's for the better. I can and will do this. 

Edit: wording and such

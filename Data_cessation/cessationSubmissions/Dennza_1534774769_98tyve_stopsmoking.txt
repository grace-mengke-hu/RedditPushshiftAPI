Heavy urges for smoking after finding out my girlfriend cheated on me.

Hello beautiful people,

I quit smoking cigarettes three days ago. This time I am really determined that I can do it once and for all. This is all because of Allen Caars book. The best thing was that I really didn't have any noticeable urges for smoking till now. Before a couple of hours I found out that my girlfriend cheated on me. Heavy urges for smoking hit me again like never before. I think I am about to smoke again. I just can't relax even for a minute and urges are becoming intolerable.Please give me some advice and support. Thank you! 
P.S - Dont look at my badge it was for my previous quit.

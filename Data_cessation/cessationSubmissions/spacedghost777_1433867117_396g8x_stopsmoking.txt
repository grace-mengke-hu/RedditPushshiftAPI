after 10 years pack a day, 6 months free of the hellish trap.

Passed 6 months without a single puff, and I could not be any fucking happier about it. I listened to the Allen Carr audiobook, thought it was stupid the whole time. When the book ended, I had no desire left to smoke. 10 years of at least a pack a day, often a pack and a half or even two. the last 2 years I hated it. The last 6 months I tried to quit every single day and couldnt, even when I got walking pneumonia. I was getting seriously depressed about how shitty I felt and my continued failure to quit. and then, by some sort of magic, I was just done. I honestly have not wanted a cigarette once since I put them down. 

I am free, and I am so, so relieved. My life is so much better...and cheaper. and yours can be, too. You can do it! 

Thanks to the support here early on, and I wish strength and hope to those newly trying to quit.

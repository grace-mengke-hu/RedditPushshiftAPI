Fail often. Fail better.

I sure hope everyone quits easily and quickly. I didn't. I failed many many times, until I didn't. 

Some folks post unusual and sometimes unproductive ways to quit, usually involving cutting down in some way. Others jump all over them. I say go ahead and try it. Fail often, fail better. You will get smarter each time you quit.

All hail you brave adventurers, scaling the climbs of addiction.

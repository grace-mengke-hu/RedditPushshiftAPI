I had "just one" and I was perfectly fine

I was out drinking with my buds and had a cigarette. Next day I didn't feel any different, and didn't want a cigarette.

What amazed me was that I could no longer smoke the cigarette. It felt almost painful, like I actually felt it damaging my lungs. It helped me realize how much my lungs have healed, and how much good I've done for myself by quitting. Overall I'm glad I had just one, because it truly helped me realize the progress I made.

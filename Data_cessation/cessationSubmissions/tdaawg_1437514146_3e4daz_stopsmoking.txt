Help me out of this danger zone

After 20 years of smoking, I've not smoked for almost 3 months now. I rarely have cravings. 

But here's the problem. At times I really miss smoking! It's not even like I feel I need one, but more just a background "miss having that in my life" feeling. 

Yeah, it's freaking ridiculous I know. 

Anyway my girlfriend is away for a week in a few days, so I get some man time,  and for some stupid reason I really want to get some smokes. 

Any tips to help me shake this one off? Been feeling like it for a few weeks.

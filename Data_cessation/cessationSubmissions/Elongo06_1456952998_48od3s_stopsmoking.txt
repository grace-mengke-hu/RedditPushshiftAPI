500 Days!!

Wow, I just can't believe it. I was a 20 year pack a day smoker and I quit using the patch and on day 2 I watched the Easy Way To Quit Smoking Video which helped a lot. 

I did the full 10 week program. The reason why I decided to go with the patch is because when I ended up in the hospital once(not related to smoking) they prescribed me a 21mg patch and it worked while I was there. I tossed around quitting but never really entertained it until I had a hard time breathing before bed times. 

I have anxiety so quitting cold turkey worried me too much. So I instead of getting a quit date, I up and quit so the anxiety wouldn't psych me out. So I got the patches and quit.

After seeing the Easy Way To Stop Smoking video I wonder what my quit would have been like cold turkey? Either way I am at day 500 nicotine free and I am loving it. 

I love the fact I don't have to rush through meals or gatherings to get outside to freeze and smoke. 

To all of you, no matter how you quit the road gets easier and easier and I wish you all luck.

I failed yesterday

Man, things went wrong at work, stressed out and pop a cigarette after being 11 days good.  FUCK, im so pissed off at myself.  This subreddit with you guys are my only journal in this quest to quit smoking.  I feel like a loser right now, even a bit ashamed.  But i feel if i write to you guys on it, it'll help me cope with quitting smoking.  Just woke up 2 hrs ago, had some coffee, feeling refreshed, now let me try this all over again..

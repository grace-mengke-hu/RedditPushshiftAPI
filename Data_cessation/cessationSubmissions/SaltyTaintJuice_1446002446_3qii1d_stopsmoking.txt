Why don't I crave cigarettes?

I've been smoking on and off since I was 16.  I got up to around a pack a day for about half a year, but just kinda stopped.  I smoke maybe a pack or two on the weekends some weekends not at all, and have done this for like 5 years. Sometimes when I drink I will binge smoke about a pack, but won't crave any the next day.  I've had a pack sitting in my car for about 2 weeks now that I bought when I was drunk.  I literally haven't even had the slightest craving to touch it.  Is there anyone else like this?

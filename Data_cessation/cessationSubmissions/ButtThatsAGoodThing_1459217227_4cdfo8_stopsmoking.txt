Tonight at 12 I will activate my badge!

It's been 4 years since I've picked up smoking. I was 18 when I started.

I've managed 3 times to stop smoking over a month. Yet still i relapsed. I would have been at 111 days now if i wouldn't have picked it up last time.... I've just now requested to remove my badge, and tonight i will re-activate it!

Now i have a girlfriend that also smokes, and that also wants to quit. She stopped yesterday and i will stop tonight!
I have total 5 cigarettes left and the last one i will smoke tonight at 12. After that it is done.

The biggest difficulty i see coming is that my GF works in a pub. So there is always alcohol and other people smoking around her. Guys please give me your advise on how i can support & motivate her to not give in! I've promised her to take her on a holiday for a week to any place where she wants to go if we can both manage to stay clean for a whole year. And i mean it. 

To all of you who just stopped smoking i say: Stay strong!
And to all who have kicked the habit i say: I salute you!

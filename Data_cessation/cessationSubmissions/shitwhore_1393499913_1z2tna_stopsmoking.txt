How do I visualize a life without smoking?

I just can't see it. Not having that smoke with my newspaper in the morning, not having one while I wait for the bus to college, not having one during the break when there's not much else to do, not having one when I'm out with my friends, not having a smoke when I visit my dad,...

I'm only 18, have smoked for 4 years so I guess that means I am not beyond saving, right?

I smoke 10-15 smokes a day. I am awake 19 hours/day too.

Help?

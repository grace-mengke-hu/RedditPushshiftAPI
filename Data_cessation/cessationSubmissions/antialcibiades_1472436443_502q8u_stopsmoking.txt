Advice on a side effect after six days cold turkey?

Briefly, I am 34, smoked since 19, have tried to quit many times, and have now completed day six of cold turkey.  I feel zero desire to smoke.  Some rough stuff (one day just in bed with fever, felt horrible), overall a positive experience.  The thing that I am most concerned about is that today and yesterday (and maybe other days, but harder to tell in the days when symptoms were more severe), around midday, I found myself becoming completely exhausted and even disoriented. To an extent where I could be afraid of falling asleep while driving, almost.  Both days, I assumed it was related to withdrawals messing with my blood sugar, and I went and had a big meal, but that made little difference.  Strangely, though, around 8pm both nights I have gotten a sudden boost of energy, sense of well-being, and normal cognitive functioning.  I have been doing well when I wake up and through the morning, as well.  So, any suggestions why I might be crashing (really hard, could definitely be a problem at work) in the middle of the day?  My first thought was diabetes (and I had a diabetes test done this week, as standard precaution when I got a physical -- doctor said I had a virus, because quitting smoking won't make you sick, LOL); though I don't have the test results back yet, I am confident it is not that, in particular because the crashes are not lining up in a way that makes sense food-wise (as far as I can tell). Outside of blood sugar, I don't know what can cause that kind of thing.

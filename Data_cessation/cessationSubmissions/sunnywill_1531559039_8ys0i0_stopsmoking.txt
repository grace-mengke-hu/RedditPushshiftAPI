Does anyone ever feel like you can't quit smoking before first changing your life in a significant way?

This is me sharing something very personal, but over several years I've been trying to 'make it' financially, but so far I haven't been successful in doing that. And throughout these years I've had quitting smoking in the back of my mind, but I've always found it really hard to do so because of my routine of smoking while thinking about my problems and objectives and going about my business throughout the day. The feeling that I get is that somehow I need to get a 'breakthrough' in my life to act as a catalyst, in order to successfully break this habit. 

I just want to know if someone else has also experienced anything like this and if so then how do they (or did they) deal with it.

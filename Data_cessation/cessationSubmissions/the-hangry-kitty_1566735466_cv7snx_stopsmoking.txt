Last night I went out drinking

And I didn’t smoke! It was the first time I’d been on a night out since I quit about 6 weeks ago, and I was really apprehensive about going, but even standing around all of the smokers didn’t make me cave in. It’s getting so much easier, I’m a non-smoker now and I’ve got this!

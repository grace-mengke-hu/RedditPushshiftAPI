24 days in

I'm twenty four days in. It has not been as impossible as I thought it would be, but the times when it is hard it is really fucking difficult. The first time I was drinking after quitting was practically impossible. All of my friends that smoke, really only smoke cigarettes when they're drinking. It was hard for me to tell myself that I was not missing out on anything by not smoking when all of my friends were and when I have such a strong association between the two.

Then today I saw someone smoking and not inhaling, which has always bothered me for some reason. It was the first time since I've quit that I imagined so vividly lighting up a cigarette and actually wanting to. There was this weird part of me that just wanted to inhale a cigarette to be like, hey, this is how you fucking smoke one. 

I don't feel like I can talk about not smoking in front of my friends that do - I remember being really annoyed by people that did that when I smoked, and it was probably just because I was jealous that they could quit and I couldn't. But nontheless, I don't feel comfortable talking about it. This community is great and is providing a lot of support. At a really basic level it's nice to have place that reminds me why I made the decision that I did, and to hear others talk about getting out of this wretched addiction. 

Cheers, good luck to everyone.

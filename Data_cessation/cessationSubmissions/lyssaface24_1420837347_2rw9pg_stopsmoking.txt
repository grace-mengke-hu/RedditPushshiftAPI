5th Day of quitting day smoking

My ultimate goal is to quit smoking all together but for now cutting out smoking during the day seems to be working. I am still smoking at night. I have tried going cold turkey and cutting down in the past and it never worked. For the first time cutting down is working for me. I went from 12 cigarettes a day to 4. I'm not looking forward to quitting smoking all together but at least i feel like i'm on the right track.

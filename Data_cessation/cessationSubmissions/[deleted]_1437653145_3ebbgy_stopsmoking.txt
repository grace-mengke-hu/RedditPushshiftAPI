Getting back on the wagon

I smoked 15 a day for 15 years.  I've had many unsuccessful quit attempts, however, this time felt good and I was ready and even got a kick out of the cravings.  I enjoyed having cravings and then beating them by not lighting up.  
After 5-6 weeks of being smoke free, I went abroad for a boozy weekend and ended up smoking.  I convinced myself it would be OK and I would just do it aboard.  But as we all know, it doesn't work like that.  
I have managed to stay off smoking during the week but have failed at weekends.  
I have a function to go to on Saturday but I'm ready to put my all back into quitting and will be requesting a new badge as of Monday.
To those who are successfully quitting; feel proud.  I felt such shame caving in and I can't wait to be smoke free, just like you.

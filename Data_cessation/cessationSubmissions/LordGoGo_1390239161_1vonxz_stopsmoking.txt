Sharing my experience.

On paper, right now I should be feeling pretty miserable.  I came down with a cold exactly one day after quitting (again, I had stopped at new years but had a couple of cigarettes a few days later), which has lingered for two weeks and I also think I have a sinus infection to boot.  Now I've got pains in my sinus cavities, I can't stop coughing, my nose is constantly producing the most profoundly disgusting discharge, and I lost my voice.  

But I honestly feel amazing!  My attitude has changed dramatically since quitting, and now I am seeing "small wins" for my self all the time.  Smoking seemed to have me under this assumption that I wasn't worth much since I couldn't even stop doing something that was killing me.  Now I see the light at the end of the tunnel, and I just can't wait to keep going until I'm back to where I used to be.  I really want to thank this community for keeping me sane (even by virtue of reading other people's posts), and to encourage everyone to stay strong, and remember you're worth saving!

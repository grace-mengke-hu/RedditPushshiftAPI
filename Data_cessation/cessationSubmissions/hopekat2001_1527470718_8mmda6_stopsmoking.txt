6 hours shy of 7 days cold turkey 😁❤😁

So I havent posted on here yet but i have been creeping the last few days reading all of your amazing posts. I am fighting the craving to go smoke a lot the past 2 days. But thanks to my supportive hubby (who has never been a smoker), this reddit, and thanks to a lot of walking/jogging (8 miles or so in 3 days) i have been able to make it to a week. 
 I am a bit concerned about a family trip we have planned next month. I know there will be drinking and my sis in law still smokes. Im trying to come up with ideas to keep from relapsing. Any suggestions? 
Thanks for all your help. ❤

My six year old son made a sign....

It says ‘No Smoking’ in black marker on dark blue construction paper. He hung it on the front door so I would see it every time I go out to the porch to smoke. He says he doesn’t want me to get black lungs and a disease and die like his grandpa (my dad) who he never met.

I want to quit. I’ve smoked for 20-ish years and I want to quit for my son. I quit when I was pregnant and breastfeeding, but then my divorce and depression gave me an excuse to start up again. I come here and read the posts on this sub and I’m so jealous of y’all and so in awe, and also so completely scared that I can’t do it.

I went and bought a vape kit (again) yesterday to help me try (again) to quit. Every time I’ve tried in the past I’ve always come back to it, and I feel like such a fucking failure. 

I know I’m rambling a bit here, but I was hoping maybe someone might share some kind words of inspiration or motivation to help me out. Thank you in advance :)

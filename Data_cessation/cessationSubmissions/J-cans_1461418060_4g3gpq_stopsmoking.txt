6 months and the numbers are staggering!

I just noticed I passed the 6 month mark. The numbers are.....eye opening to say the least. I've saved $3,320 and NOT smoked over 5,500 cigarettes! That's crazy. To think I did that consistently for 20 years, I'm lucky to be healthy now! 

So now for some inspiration;

Pre quit running distance: about 36 feet
Post quit running distance: regularly running 5ks in about a half hour 

Pre quit cycling distance: to the store for more smokes (1.5 mile round trip)
Post quit cycling distance: 12 miles in the woods on non running days. 

Pre quit hangovers: bad, everytime I drank!
Post quit hangover: what's a hangover?

My sense of smell has returned (blessing and curse) I can take a deep breath now and I can get a lot more done in a day, mostly because I don't need to pay any attention to smoking (getting smokes, going to smoke.....). 

To be honest, best thing I ever did.

To those out there considering quitting, just starting to quit and those having trouble getting through the first weeks;

You CAN do it, things DO get better, keep your ATTITUDE positive!

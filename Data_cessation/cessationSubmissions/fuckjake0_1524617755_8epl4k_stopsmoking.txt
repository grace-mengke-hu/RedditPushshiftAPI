Smoking for almost 9 years... Vaping?

I started smoking at 16 as my whole family was smokers and I'm about to be 25... I have a horrible cough and pains in my lungs/throat as I'm kind of a chain smoker. I bought a satisfying vape a while back that I'm pretty sure I could quit with. My question is, does anyone think vaping vegetable glycerin is any better than tabacco products or noticed any health changes from switching.

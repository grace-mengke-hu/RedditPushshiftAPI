How to quit when it's become a part of your work routine?

Simple question, but it's been real tough to execute. Every time I go to work in the morning, I smoke one. And another one, and another one...... Basically the only time of the day I smoke is while I'm working. In the evenings after work I don't do it and I'm smoke free during weekends or any other day I have free. Just that every time I return to work, it's the same story all over again. I want to quit, really..... Been hiding the fact that I smoke from my family for more than a year. So, any help would be highly appreciated.

Here's my next attempt.

I quit in November and went without smoking for six months. I remember feeling great and not having to stand in the cold was a plus for sure.

Soon I never even wanted to smoke. I was eating healthier, enjoying tea everyday, and getting exercise.

For some reason I started again. I ignored NOPE once and fell back in. Once again I feel like shit, more anxious and always tired.

I have decided to quit now that I have a new job. I've decided to start eating healthy again and saving my money so that I can go on vacation in February. Ultimately this is for me and my health because I can see the change a few months of smoking can cause.

Tomorrow morning is Day 1.

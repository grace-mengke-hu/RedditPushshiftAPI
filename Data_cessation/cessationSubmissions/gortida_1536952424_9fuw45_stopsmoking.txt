Where to start?

Ok. I've read through quite a bit of these posts but I'd like some feedback as well.

I've been smoking for 5 years now, a few packs a week. I've tried smoking one less a day, and that didn't work. I've decided I'm going to quit after this last box is done so no temptations. Any advice???? What can I expect? How much better did you feel physically once the addiction passed?

I'm planning to get some gum to deal with the oral fixation. My big hindrance is that smoking is my escape to take a short break or step outside for a minute during the work day or at a bar. Any first time quitting tips would be very much appreciated.

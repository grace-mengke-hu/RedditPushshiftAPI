Need some help. I am quitting cold Turkey in 6 days. 25 years of smoking, currently at 1-2packs a day. I need a plan. Mine sucks.

Hello,

As it says in the title. I am planning on quitting next friday. I picked the day as I can take the day off of work, my kids will be gone for the weekend and I can stay at my friends house for my long weekend. Hes a strong source of support. He also has apple tv and I can hide/sob in the darkness. My friends a buddhist meditator/yoga teacher. Worried that I might kill him with all his positivity. Currently, I wake up in the middle of the night to smoke.  

Not sure when I will have another opportunity. So what should I be doing? I've been mentally prepping for a few weeks. I stopped smoking in my car, cut back on caffeine. I know I should have some fruit juice on hand, i've been readin stuff on www.whyquit.com. I might keep a journal.

Any other tips? Is there a FAQ here that I am not seeing?

I'll smoke my last cig on thursday night. I have a very stressful job that I will return to on Monday as well as two small children, an ex wife, and a bunch of legal problems (IRS). Its not gonna be an easy few months. 

Sorry for the wall o text. And thanks.

I lasted 22 hours

Feeling pretty shitty. So many failed attempts to beat this bitch. I don't really know what to do. The longest I've lasted is ~100 days, but I throw it away every time and give in. Couldn't even make it a day this time. Looking for words of comfort or some shit I guess. I feel pathetic.

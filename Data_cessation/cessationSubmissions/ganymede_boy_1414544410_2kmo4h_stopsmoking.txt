1,000 days

Underrated benefit of quitting: the encouragement it can give others to follow suit. 

My only advice on this day is this: be someone elses 'quit buddy' or encouragement to beat this thing... I needed mine more than I knew at the time, and I was fortunate to be able to return the favor to others later on.

Stay strong!

Day 4 - Checking in

Just wanted to check in.
Today is my fourth day without cigarettes. This is the third time I'm trying to quit, and I have to say that so far I'm having a much easier time. I have some physical withdrawal symptoms (for example, I woke up shivering, covered in sweat this night), but they're manageable.

The cravings are definately there, but I have found a way to counter them pretty effectively. Whenever I feel the urge to bum a cigarette, I remember how I felt after I caved during my previous quits. That first cigarette in days: pure bliss. Your brain welcomes to long lost nicotine.
Any cigarettes you smoke after that taste like shit again and you spend the rest of your day/week feeling guilty and weak.
Why would I cave, knowing these facts? I won't!

Good luck to every one of you!

Nicotine Patch Question

Dear Redditors, 

I have been on the patch for two weeks. For the first week, I would steal puffs from my friends about twice a day and I smoked about 4 cigarettes on two separate occasions when I was drinking. Last Friday, I read Carr's book and (though I want to continue with the patch) find that the book has helped me manage my cravings very well. It has been a week since I've touched a cigarette. In general, I am very happy with the patch and I do not think about cigarettes much during the day at all. However, whenever the patch is off (like for an hour in the morning while I get ready), I find that my cravings for cigarettes are very very strong. Stronger than they were during the 10 days or so when I quit cold turkey last year. This worries me. I fear that when it is time to taper off the patch, I'll find it very difficult. 

Do you think the cravings are in my head? Any reason for such violent cravings? Does anyone have any experience with coming off the nicotine patch? Please help!!

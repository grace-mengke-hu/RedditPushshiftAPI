Trying for the 4'th time .

I have been trying to quit for quite a while now. I hope this time its permanent . Everytime it starts with that one 'victory smoke' and its back to the old count . 

One thing i do when i feel the craving is remind myself of the smell of cigarettes , if i cant i take a walk and in my country there are quite a few people smoking outside my house / office etc so i go there and smell the smoke and bam the cravings are gone !

Another trick i use is , the place where i used to smoke and think when i had a problem , i basically take a glass of hot water (after around 2 mins in the microwave) this helps me feel the weight in my throat that comes from smoking .


Finally i wanna end this with a question , a heavy smoker friend of mine is coming this weekend (pot not tobacco) . I read online that we can use parsley instead of tobacco as a 'filler' for the joint as i just saw someone elses post claiming tobacco in the joint gave them cravings after smoking it . 
Let me know about other alternatives (cant vape and a neat joint really blows us away)

Being broke is helping me quit

But is it sustainable? 
I keep having this nagging in the back of my head that as soon as I get paid I'm just going to go out and buy some smokes then go through a whole pack that same day. 

I've only been smoking for a year and would love to quit. I just keep making excuses for myself. My SO has been super helpful. Offering support and (mostly) gentle reminders that I don't actually need the cigarettes. But it's getting really frustrating for the both of us.

Any advice for when my paycheque comes through?

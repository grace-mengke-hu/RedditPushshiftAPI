I quit about a year ago, but have recently started getting cravings again. Not sure why. I fear that I am close to a relapse.

Is something like this common? I wasn't a very heavy smoker, so quitting wasn't that difficult.  For the past week or so I have been having very strong cravings, it's almost as bad as when I quit the first time. Any ideas why this could be? I had gone months without thinking too much about smoking.

Pretty much the only thing saving me is the fact that I am currently in the US so I can't buy loose cigarettes, and I really fear buying a pack. If I had been back home, I would certainly have bought a loose one, and went down a spiral.

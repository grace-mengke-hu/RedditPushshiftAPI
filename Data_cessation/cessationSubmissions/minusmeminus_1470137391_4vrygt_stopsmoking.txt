Half or year down :) biggest challenge though

So I did it..I think i finally quot for good this time. This is the longest ive gone in a while. I have no cravings at all.. Only issue is when I quit smoking I was 6"2 208lbs I was a big guy but not super fat. Now im still same height lol but I weigh 250lbs. Yes you heard that right I gained 42lbs after quitting smoking. I'm happy I quit smoking but I gotta say i feel terrible. Since the weight gain im always out of breath when excersizing or even just walking allot. I know its the weight gain cause ive never been this heavy. I'm kidna at a loss on how to get this weight off. Anyone gone through what im going through if so please throw some advice at me :)

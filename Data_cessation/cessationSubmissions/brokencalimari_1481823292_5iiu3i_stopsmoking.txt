Day 2 on the patch

So far the cravings are very minimal. I'm wondering if I should keep using the patch or not. It's not been all that hard for me so far but I'm wondering if the patch has something to do with that. So far I'm enjoying being smoke free but I want to be nicotine free as well. Does anyone have any experience with this? Should I stay on the patch?

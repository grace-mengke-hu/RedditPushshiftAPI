15days cold turkey

Hey guys! 

Just wanted to share some of the revelations from my quit in the event it helps even one person navigating the same stuff.

**The start point** was an impulsive crushing and breaking of my last pack (15 smokes) the night before my spontaneous quit date. Chucked them into the kitchen garbage can after dinner and didnt think much else of it - no savouring a ‚Äúlast smoke‚Äù before bed. That helped a lot. 

**Day 1** was a work day, and true to form with day 1 so many little things came up that seemed like the greatest excuse to hit the gas station. Pause. This is just like any other Wednesday so you are just Manufacturing a bad day to get out of the quit.

I then headed home for lunch, and as I was making a coffee I thought...I wonder if any of those smokes are still good. 

Hang on a second. You actually *had the impulse* to go through the trash for a smoke. There‚Äôs another sign it‚Äôs really time to break this hold they have on you. 

The remainder of the day I was able to carry myself through on this ‚Äúgreater good‚Äù mentality. 33% of the nicotine had now left my system.

**Day 2** was a half day at work, so had an excess of time on my hands in the morning before going in. Uh oh. Those are the days brisk walks for a big coffee and smokes go down.

Truthfully could not handle it so I just drank water and stayed in bed watching mindless crap on Netflix until I went in, then proceeded to do the same once I got home from work. A write off day by my ordinary standard but given the top priority at the time, an astounding victory.

**Day 3** ahh the final day of nicotine in the system...I had built this one up to be the home stretch of chemical dependence and after this it was all just a mind game. 

Cue a disagreement with the girlfriend out of nowhere that on any other quit would have been cause to give in. But nope, not this time. I‚Äôd come too far and recognized at earlier cravings how the addiction was tricking me.

**Day 4-??**

Repeat. Not today. You‚Äôve come too far. Not one more puff. 

I‚Äôve been in Thailand (the land of cheap and prolific tourist smoking) for the past 10 days and while there have been a couple of drink-induced cravings I have not given up. I will not give up.

All those people wandering the streets and beaches dont have some advantage by smoking. Their trip isnt augmented by that brief head rush and subsequent craving

For the last 10 days here i will maintain this victory - and if i can do that **here** of all places then back home in Canada it will be even easier.

You got this, reader. You and me both üëç

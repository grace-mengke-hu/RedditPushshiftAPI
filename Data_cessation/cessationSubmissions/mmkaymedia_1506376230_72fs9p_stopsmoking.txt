I'll stop one day at a time. No exceptions

I'm doing this because my addiction to smoking reflects my addiction to sloppy manners and behavior. I feel that if I can accomplish this, then I'm capable of other things as well.

It's going to be rather hard; I hang with various groups of people who are all chain smokers. It's so easy to just ask someone for one, and it's back to square one. And I also have a Vegas trip coming up this weekend...but I'll try my best.

For now, this is my one goal.

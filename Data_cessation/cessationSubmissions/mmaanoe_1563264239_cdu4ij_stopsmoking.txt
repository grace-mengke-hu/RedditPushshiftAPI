im trying to quit for real this time but i need motivation

I'm 20, i've been addicted for around 2 and a half years now and it has noticeably decreased the quality of my life. I have tried to quit multiple times but the longest I've ever made it is just under a week. I just wanna be able to breathe normal again lol. I just downloaded the stop smoking app and started my timer for what I'm hoping will be the last time. If you've taken the time to read this post please drop some motivation and advice for me as I try to stop robotically consuming poison every day!

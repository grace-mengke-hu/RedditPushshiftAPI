Stopped smoking last night

I finished smoking my last pack of cigarettes last night without realizing it, and decided it would be my last. School is starting back up in a week, along with all of my other activities and I can't keep wasting my money by spending 20 dollars a week smoking.

I've got gum, and the lozenges and they do help with the cravings even if I do feel sick after every time I take them. I'll consider it as a negative reinforcement to go with my cravings, and take one whenever I get a craving. Hopefully the nausea will help.

Anyways, I expect to post a bit more often, and I'll actually get around to reading Allen Carrs book this time, as well as use an app to keep track and remind myself why I'm stopping for good this time.

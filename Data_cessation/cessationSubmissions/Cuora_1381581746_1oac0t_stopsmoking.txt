First day smoke free in 5 years!

My smoking history is pretty ugly. I  started when I was 18 and old enough to know better. Ive smoked at least one cig every day since, and I smoke alot. I knew from the first weeks in tgat I was heavily, heavily addicted. I smoked way more than my friends and my partner. I always felt guilty about it. 

 In year 3 of the addiction morning cigs became a constant thing. Coffee without a cig was impossible. Driving without a cig, drinking, etc. The idea of going a day without was impossible. 

 It was getting in the way of all sorts of things,  socialising,  my jobs,  making new friends,  but most importantly I felt like a failure whenever I considered how I had become so addicted.  I was riddled with guilt and self doubt. It affected me in all sorts of negative ways.  

Lay week I came home,  smoked the last 3 of my gf's cigs, and drove to the shops to replace them.  I came home just after her, and tossed her the pack. She said, "Oh,  I've quit". I was so sad when she quit because i knew I never could. All week I've tried to cut back as I watched her go cold turkey. I was so jealous of her self control.

With a lot of effort, i managed to cut down from 10-15per day to just 2 per day for three days. Only then did I realise that I can do it!  Cravings are not to bad, and I feel better already.  So much self respect is back.  I feel like I am beating my demons.  I'm gaining control back.

For years ive been a slave to myself and my addictions.  Not any more.  I'm giving this up,  and you can too!

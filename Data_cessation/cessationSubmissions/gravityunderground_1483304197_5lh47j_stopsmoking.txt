Good luck all. Here's what's working for me

I used the 7mg patch for five days to overcome powerful "needs": 
- to pass smoke through my lungs
- for smoke breaks during work
- for comforting hand-to-mouth motions

I can't imagine ever getting through the first week without a patch. But that's just me. 

When I went patch-free, the cravings and depression rushed back all over again, but this time, I only needed to focus on the nicotine cravings. Keeping a cravings journal has been incredibly helpful.

It's Day 7 and I'm feeling mostly sane again.

Escaping this addiction is no joke. While it's harder than anything I've ever done in my life, I'm pretty sure it's a cakewalk compared to being told I have lung cancer and need to go through chemo. Can't imagine leaving my wife with my young kids to fend for themselves while paying my medical bills. That right there is seriously painful sh*t.

Fighting this addiction suddenly becomes a thankful task.

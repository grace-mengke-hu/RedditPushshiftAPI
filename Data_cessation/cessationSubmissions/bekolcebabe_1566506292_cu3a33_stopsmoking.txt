Banished the beast again today, feeling proud &amp; awesome

Managed to stay strong again despite the MOST horrendously stressful few days, really starting to feel like a non-smoker 🤠 I know I can’t ever let my guard down or have even one puff, but told more family today I quit as well. I think I got this! Loving the feeling &amp; freedom 😁🤠💪😀 Nearly day 19 smoke free!

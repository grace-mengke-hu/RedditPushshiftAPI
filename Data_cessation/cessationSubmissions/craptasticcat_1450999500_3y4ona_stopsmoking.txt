How long until the muscle tension eases?

I quit smoking cold turkey a week ago (yay!), and I'm around family a lot so there is little opportunity to buy another pack thankfully. 

The muscle tension in my back and shoulders and neck is unreal. Every time I've quit and caved in the past, I could feel my shoulders relax with my first cig back. :/ now it feels like the tension is building and getting worse. 

Planning on getting to the gym asap, but any advice is appreciated for coping and being pleasant over the next few days. Thanks  and happy holidays!!

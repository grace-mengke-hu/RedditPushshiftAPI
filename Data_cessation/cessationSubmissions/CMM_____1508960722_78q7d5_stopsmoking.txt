Need a quit smoking “sponsor”

Hello all,

Posted on here a couple times before, but most recently quit last Thursday and made it til just an hour and a half ago. I was and still am super proud of myself for quitting, this time *without NRT*. 

I struggle with anxiety, and smoking is the most effective coping mechanism I know to deal with it. I know it’s not healthy and it’s not even like I want to smoke or crave the cigarette itself. What I crave is for the anxiety to go away.

I’m really looking for help this time. No the past I’ve felt alone in my quit attempts - in the fact that I don’t really talk about it with anyone with any real experience that’s been through quitting before.

I’m extremely involved in AA and actually have over 2 years sober from drugs and alcohol. I’m looking for in lack of a better term a sponsor that I can message or contact when the cravings or urge gets rough. I know all the advice, I’ve read easy way, but what I need is to ask for help and receive an objective viewpoint on my dilemma.

I will be posting on here regularly to keep myself accountable and detail my progress. 

Thanks all, let me know if you can help.

Damn, I missed my 1 years anniversary.

So there you have it. Eventually, not smoking becomes so easy that you don't even realise you haven't smoked for a whole year.

For anyone just starting, just promise yourself that you won't smoke today. It might feel really tough right now but it does get so much easier.

Oh yeah, my top tip (that helped me): Acknowledge your cravings. When you crave, say to yourself "In the past, I would have had a smoke in this situation. I'd have to be a complete dick to do that now and ruin my record."

An alcoholic trying to quit

So here it is...as anyone done it being in my condition.I don't feel like quitting drinking.Sometimes I go all day without a smoke,but when the evening come and I crack a beer...a second one.... I get this strong urge.

I know I can do it,I hate smoking,hell I smoke one puff and throw the rest away,or juste smoke while I take a piss.
I don't feel like vaping or anything else really.Just want to quit cold turkey and end it for good.Been thinking this trough for a while now,but still can't get past one day.

Before I really wanted to commit was smoking half a pack a day for about 7years now,jeez time go fast when you smoke.

In a few hours I'm gonna go back to sleep,and this habbit will end,I've already put so much effort into it.
Once quitted for 6 months before relapse,that's a proof to me I can make it.And this time for ever.

Needed to get this out,thanks for reading. Help me please I'm gonna die!

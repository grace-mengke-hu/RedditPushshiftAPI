Can you guys help? Addicted to bongs...of tobacco.

I want to know first off how bad this is, been addicted to weed and cigarettes 3 years now.

I smoke about 20 bowls on average a day of just tobacco, when I don't have weed. I smoke 2-4 bongs every 30 minutes to an hour usually.

When I do have weed its a bit less bit I smoke poppers which is a piece of a cigarette cut off, about half inch of it I'd say, put in a shaft, weed stamped on top.

I haven't smoked weed without tobacco in years, yesterday after smoking a bunch of poppers in a row (weed + tobe) I got sick feeling from getting too high then when i threw up I threw up blood. Was pretty fucked.

I'm only 22 and some mornings I wake up barely able to breathe, healthy weight too. Decided I need to quit all smoking, had asthma since I was 4 n this aint helpin it.

It's so fucking hard though , I feel so weak, I just want to get baked after work n escape life, and I just want to be able to smoke at work and be able to make it through the day without hating my life. Fuck I really hate my life lol, anyone know if smoking weed + tobe in a bong, taking huge fat rips 15+ times a day will fuck you up worse than a pack a day? Kinda scared

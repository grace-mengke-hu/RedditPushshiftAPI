On my 7th day without a cigarette (longest I've gone so far) and I owe it all to vaping.

Vaping is amazing. I even prefer it to cigarettes. I can get far more of a buzz vaping than I could with cigarettes. Now obviously I don't want to vape nicotine for the rest of my life. I plan to get e-liquids with lower concentrations of nicotine over time. I'm just so happy I've gone this long without a cigarette. Never smoking another cigarette a day.

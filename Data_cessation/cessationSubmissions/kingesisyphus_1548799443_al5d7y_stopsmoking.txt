What did you do to stop smoking those cigarettes for when you're bored at home?

I've managed to quit my "habit cigarettes" (after eating, lunch break, before bed) but I can't bring myself to stop smoking when I'm bored at home doing nothing and think a cigarette will make me happy (and it does until I'm like halfway of smoking it) I'll appreciate knowing your tricks.

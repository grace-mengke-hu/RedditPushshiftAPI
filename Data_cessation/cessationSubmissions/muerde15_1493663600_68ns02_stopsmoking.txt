Cutting Back vs Cold-Turkey - Pathway to Quitting

Hi Folks, 

I just joined up today and have been reading through a lot of the posts - very inspiring stuff!  At the time of writing this, I haven't had a cigarette in just a little over 17hours and originally had the intention of starting this week with a cutting back method introduced by a co-worker (no car-smoking, only smoking after 5pm M-F and on the weekends - they said they got to the point in cutting back where they would feel nauseous if they had one, which led them to ultimately quitting).

I've quit cold turkey a few times in the past, with the longest probably being 4-5 months.  I'm 27 years old and have smoked since age ~18, now at an all-time high per-day average of about 12 cigs/day.

Please let me know your thoughts on the CT vs Cutting Back debate, and what worked for you/what didn't.  Today I keep thinking I should just try quit CT again, and try run with my current (albeit small) amount of progress, but I am interested in the Cutting Back method mentioned above (could also be the addiction chiming in).

Thank you!

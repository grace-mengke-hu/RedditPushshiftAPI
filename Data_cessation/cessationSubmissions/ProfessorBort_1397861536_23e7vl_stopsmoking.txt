Adderall makes me want to smoke. Are there better alternatives?

I have a pretty high intensity job and I have an adderall prescription to help me keep focused during the day.  On the weekends I don't use it, as it gives me a little nausea and kills my appetite.  The thing is, I only smoke when I am on Adderall and when I stop on the weekends, I don't feel the urge to smoke at all.  Have any of you encountered this and if so, did you find that using an alternative such as Vivance helped with the cravings?  I'd really like to stop smoking and I feel if Adderall is the cause of my cravings, I'd like to find a switch.

Thank you.

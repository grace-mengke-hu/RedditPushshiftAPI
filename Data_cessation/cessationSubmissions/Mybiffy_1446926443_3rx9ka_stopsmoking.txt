Day 26

Two months ago I was diagnosed with a blockage in my artery in my lower leg. Scared the shit out of me. I'm 47 and have smoked over 30 years. One month ago my sister in law got diagnosed with incurable lung cancer.. Scared me even more. The Dr. Told me stopping smoking was the number one thing I can do to prevent more blockages. In my 30 years of smoking, I never tried to quit. I was hooked, and I THOUGHT I loved it. We all think we are invincible until something happens to us or a loved one. I knew I'd need help to quit. I did two things.. I got prescription for Chantix and I downloaded a book called The Easy Way to Stop Smoking by Allen Carr. Both excellent choices for me. Chantix is a 12 week prescription. I smoked the first 5 weeks I took it. I kept thinking I can't do this. I can't stop. But I set my quit date for October 12th and I've not had one cig since. I feel great. The chantix has literally changed my life. The cravings come and go and are pretty easy to deal with. Even around smoking, I'm not bothered. In fact, it smells bad. I also downloaded an app called Smoke Free. It's so amazing to watch my health improve daily and see my progress. Do whatever you have to do to stop. Tell everyone you are quitting so you have support.. And don't give up!!! Do it for yourself!!!! Good luck everyone!!!

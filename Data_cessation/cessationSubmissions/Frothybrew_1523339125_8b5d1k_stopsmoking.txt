891 days... It's been a while.

I didn't smoke for a very long time. However for the couple of years I did smoke, I would chain smoke every day and was not in the best of shape physically and mentally.

Exercise, good diet and drinking green tea is what really helped me stop. My girlfriend also stopped around the same time as me, so we helped each other. The first run I ever went on the day after I decided to stop, was what motivated me to continue. The sound of my breath was dreadful, hearing it as I ran was my trigger I suppose. I now have a consistent workout routine, which I would have never imagined myself doing three years ago.

I will admit last year I almost started again, due to being in a terrible living situation that was bringing me down. However I managed to pull through. I honestly do not miss anything about the habit.

The smell is also atrocious, I really can't stand the smell anymore.

I used to come here quite a bit in the beginning whenever I craved a cigarette. Reading other people's stories helped me get into the mindset of disgust towards cigarettes, rather than the fetishisation of them.

Places like this are a great starting point. But at the end of the day, it's down to self-discipline and willpower.

Thank you if any of you read this, I sincerely wish you all the best with your cigarette-free lives. Your health is worth more.

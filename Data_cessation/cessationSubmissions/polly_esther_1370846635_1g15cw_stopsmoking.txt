My badge says 99!

But it's actually 100 as I'm an Aussie and we are several hours ahead.

I'm so thrilled about it and just wanted to share the best bit. 

I'm on holiday at the moment, and in the past I'd agonise about where to stay, where has a balcony that allows smoking, where can I smoke etc etc.

Some holiday, hey? Good god, what a lot of time I wasted looking for places I could smoke.

This time? I've just done whatever I liked, stayed at really great places and *I* have been choosing what to do and where to go, not my stupid dependence on cigs.

So liberating, and its been the most relaxing trip ever. Oh, and I've paid for three weeks accommodation in North America on the money I've saved on buying cigs.

Keep strong, you ex smokers, and be kind to yourselves xxx

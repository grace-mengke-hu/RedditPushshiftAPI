I'm really, really craving a cigarette. I've never smoked, ever.

Not sure if a different subreddit would be a better place for this, but this was the first one I could think of.

Let me be clear. I have never smoked a cigarette in my entire life. Not even a puff on someone else's or one at a party or anything like that. Never.

Despite that, I am craving a cigarette. I myself don't really understand how I can having never experienced it, but I am. None of my friends smoke, no family members, no one. My parents both did but quit long before they had me.

Anyone know why this might be? I read somewhere online that even if your parents stopped before you were born this could still happen. I'm 18, this hasn't really happened before. In the past month I've had it a little bit, but right now at work it's *very* strong. Any advice?

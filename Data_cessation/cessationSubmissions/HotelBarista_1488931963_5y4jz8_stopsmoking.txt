Where do I even start?

I'm sure you guys get this post a lot but I just have no idea where to begin or even how to begin. I've been smoking since I was 12 and I'm 25 now. My husband and I have been putting some serious thoughts into having kids, but obviously that's not happening until I quit. He hasn't smoked in 12 years, and he's never said anything about me smoking.

I pretty much always smoke. Cooking, gaming, driving, watching TV. I've quit smoking weed about 2 months ago so I can get a better job, but my smoking has only gotten worse since then. 

I feel crappy about it. Random strangers and friends show their disgust and I feel terrible every time I think about how much money I spend in a week just on smokes, especially when money is tight. 

Where do you start? And how do you convince yourself this is possible?

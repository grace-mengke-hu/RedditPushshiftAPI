My twentieth and final attempt..

I have been trying to quit smoking for more than three years now. I have smoked for about 18 years, initially just 2 or 3 a day to almost a pack a day now. I have tried quitting several times and I have been successful in giving up for 2 or 3 or 4 months, but then back. It was always while traveling, I feel like I can smoke while I am on holiday and I can quit again once I get back to London and every time I failed. 

I knew that it will be like this after the first time, but my brain uses some convoluted logic to convince me to smoke. I have been through the first week more times than I can remember, I have read Allen Carr's book, read hundreds of posts on this sub to learn from other people's experiences, yet it has not worked.

Now I am desperate, I have been destroying my health. I suffer from an autoimmune condition where the rate at which the disease progresses is 5x faster for smokers than non-smokers. I really really want to quit.. and this time I will.

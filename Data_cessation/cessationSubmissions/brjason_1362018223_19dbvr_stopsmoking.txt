38 days. I've been doing fine. REALLY thinking of smoking "just one."

Moving out of my place today and tomorrow. During the year and half that I've rented this room I've had all kinds of adventures on the roof outside my window, and many of those times have involved cigs. EXTREMELY tempted to smoke one last cig out there for the memories. I've had a cig in my hand and even in my mouth for the first time in weeks, but I haven't gone out there and lit it yet. It's more tempting because of how relatively easy it was for me to quit this time... it really does feel like I could just smoke this one (or even just part of it) and be done again.

Part of me knows this is stupid, but that part seems to be losing ground. ugh

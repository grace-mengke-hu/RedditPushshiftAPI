Someone experiencing similar changes in social environment?

Ever since I stopped smoking, I have the feeling I am not seeing certain people anymore. I think either consciously and unconsciously. Honestly, 65% to 75% of my (ex-)friends are smokers and it is hard to actually keep going to houses or meet ups where you are the ONLY one not smoking. Especially, when you have friends smoking inside their dorms and so on.

Additionally, when I quit smoking cigarettes, I also took a very tight grip on smoking weed. Going from smoking it on a daily 6 months ago to now very sporadically (once every 2 to 3 weeks). Building up towards not smoking it at all anymore. This resulted in, again, not seeing or meeting people I have been seeing a lot these last few years. They say it is indeed hard to spend all your time on everyone you know, so you do not talk or see everyone every day or week. But a lot of these people I have known for a long time and have been spending a lot of time with as well.

Is it a good or a bad thing that I don't see them as much as a couple of months ago? Thanks in advance. Sorry for any typos, English is not my mother tongue.

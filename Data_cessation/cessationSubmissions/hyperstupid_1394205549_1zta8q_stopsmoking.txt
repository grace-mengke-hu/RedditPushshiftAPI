Fell off wagon, hopping back on.

I had 800 days smoke-free.  I started smoking again because some misshapen synaptic wiring convinced me there'd be no harm in a single poof.

I smoked for the last two months and it all came back so quickly.  Maybe the first 2 were nice, but it's a ball and chain after a single pack.

I quit cold turkey before, I am using a vaporizing cigarette for today and tomorrow then it's 0 nicotine for me.

That's all.  I failed but I'm getting back at it.

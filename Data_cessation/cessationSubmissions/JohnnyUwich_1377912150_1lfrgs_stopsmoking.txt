Need help.. underaged, trying to stop this habit.

As I write this, I'm smoking, unfortunately. Almost all of my family is against it, except my grandmother. She bought me a pack knowing what I'm going through. I recently lost a grandfather, and I've been cheated on by my girlfriend.. who I gave my first time to. She cheated on me, but now I hear she's tried committing suicide over me.. I'll be turning 16 in October, I want to be clean by then. I'm slowing my intake. Been smoking for maybe 8 months. It's a crutch. Sad? Smoke. Mad? Smoke. Need to relax? Smoke. That's my "Me" time. That's how my brain works now. I took this up because I wanted to shorten my life, don't ask why, please, I'm young, and obviously very dumb.. I don't want to end up a middle aged dead man. I've tried quitting before, longest I've stood clean was two months, then she cheated... bleh. I don't know how this subreddit responds to underage smokers, but I hope you all realize I am a victim too, whether it be from my own doing or not. Alone, depressed, just tell me what I can do to stop.

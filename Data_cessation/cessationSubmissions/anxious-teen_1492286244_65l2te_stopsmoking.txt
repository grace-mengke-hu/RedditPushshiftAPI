Anyone quit with patches?

I quit smoking 16 hours ago and am trying to quit smoking using nicotine patches. But, I am having constant cravings to smoke, does this mean the patch isn't working? I can't tell if the craving is habitual or some sort of withdrawal meaning the patch isn't supplying enough nicotine. 

Has anyone had success using the patches or has any advice?

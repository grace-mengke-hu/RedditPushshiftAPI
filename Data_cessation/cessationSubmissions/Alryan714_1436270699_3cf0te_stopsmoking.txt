Week 3

Made it to week 3 still not smoking, made it through fighting with my in laws, partying with my family, my baby teething, and many many other triggers. I still have not got drunk but I think I am ready for that this friday. My mom is taking the baby so my husband and I can have a night off.  I got this but this week so far the cravings have been so bad but I am taking one minute at a time. I will be strong. I will get through all of this.

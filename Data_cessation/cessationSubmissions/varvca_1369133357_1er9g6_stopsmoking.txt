Hey Guys..any advice?

Hey guys. I have been on and off the whole quit smoking thing for awhile now. Everytime I try to quit i can go a few days to a couple weeks then i have just one and im back on them.

I just have no fucking clue what I would do if I quit smoking. I would be so happy if i did but its REALLY hard.

Like, I love going outside and just sitting and relaxing for a while having a couple. If i dont smoke when im sitting outside or hanging with friends I just feel weird. Its like my brain tells my body to feel weird if I dont have one you know?

My main point is I dont know what i would do with spare time and such if i didnt smoke and I need tips on STOPPING THIS GROSS HABBIT. Thanks alot for taking time to read this.

what is this pain in my right armpit?

Started about a week after quitting smoking, seemed a bit unusually lumpy in there.  Really awful pain that I just woke up with one morning.  
A friend suggested that it's from lymphnodes but there seems to be a minimal amount of information that I can find online about this.
I found a suggestion to walk, which I do a lot of, I've also been running and trying to massage that pain away.  It seems deep in there and only in my right armpit. It has subsided a little but kind of came back nearly as strong again today.

Anyone else have this problem? Any suggestions or references?

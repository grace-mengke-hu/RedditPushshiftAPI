Here's a trick that's good for me!

I haven't quit but I'm successfully cutting back. Making one pack last 5 days rather than one... Never-matter, what I do is what fights against the hardest part of quitting, routine. 

At work I walk outside with a tea and check my phone and listen to music and I go back inside with a part of me satisfied.

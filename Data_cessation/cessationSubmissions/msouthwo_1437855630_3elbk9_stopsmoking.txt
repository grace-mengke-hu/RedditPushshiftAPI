Really want to quit

Hey everyone, 
I've been smoking for a couple years now and I want to quit so bad, but I haven't been able to. I'm sick of so many things about it, and I am fearful for my long term health if I don't quit. I just don't know how to do it. I have tried many times before; I even tried a vape, but I am allergic to the juice and got severe liver inflammation. I really just want to quit cold turkey, so does anyone have any tips?

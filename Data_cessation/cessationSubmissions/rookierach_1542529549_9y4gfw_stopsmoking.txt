Nobody told me about the ulcers!

I'm 11 days smoke-free, I have tried to quit a few times and I always forget about the damn ulcers! My mouth is full of them and it makes it so hard to eat. It's so painful!

This post doesn't really have a point, I just needed to rant. I'm also excessively eating sugary treats, drinking energy drinks etc despite eating super healthy while I was a smoker. 

Just hoping I can get through this! The dreams havent started yet but I'm sure they're definitely coming in a few weeks.

Smoking alternatives?

After 2 years I am 9 days smoke free. I swore I wouldn't use NRT, vape pens, or e cigarettes but the worst cravings have been hitting the past few days and I have almost relapsed. 

I thought I couldn't say I've quit if I used some kind of alternative, but I'm starting to think that anything is better than picking up a real cigarette. 

Any suggestions of what I could use that's not particularly bad for my health?

Need a Pep Talk

Long story short, I've been avoiding this sub, even unsubscribed because I was sick of seeing posts while I continued to smoke.  I was a fraud.  See my badge for current progress.  Tonight I'll be going to a Christmas party, tomorrow night out at bars.  Already feeling the now familiar symptoms of quitting cold turkey.  For anyone out there thinking about a relapse, don't.  It just gets harder to commit to quitting once you know how shitty it is.  I've done this a couple times, and it does not get easier.  Anyway, I'd really appreciate it if anyone who feels charitable could send me some words of encouragement as ammunition for my coming test.  I really don't want to start over again.  Thank you.  I missed you guys.

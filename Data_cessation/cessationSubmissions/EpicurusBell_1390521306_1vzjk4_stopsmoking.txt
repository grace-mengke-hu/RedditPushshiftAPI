Question before quitting...

So I've tried to quite several times before, however I can never seem to make it past a day. When I go a full day, I just desperately crave the inhaling action of the smoke. Because of this, I was thinking of trying an eCig, but not sure if that defeats the point...Any thoughts suggestions tips would be greatly appreciated!

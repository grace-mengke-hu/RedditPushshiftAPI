At what point do the cravings get "tolerable"?

I had my last cigarette and pipe on Sunday the 15th (had that date planned for two weeks knowing full well that would be my final smoke). As of right now, the cravings are insane. I have an app that gives me goals to reach and a "craving timer" that I'm supposed to turn on when I'm getting a bad one (it's supposed to assure me that it's only temporary, I guess), and I have an e-cig with a VERY low nicotine content to help with the first month or two, but these cravings are getting out of control. They are lasting up to 15-20 minutes and during that time I can't focus on anything other than the gas station right across the street and how easy it would be to pick up a pack. If these cravings hit while I'm in class it's nearly unbearable because I can't hit the e-cig and I can't focus on anything the prof is saying. 

Now that my bitching is over, and I'm sure many of you had it MUCH worse than me (I was "only" addicted for three years), my question goes out to those of you who were successful with your quit. When will these cravings slow down to a manageable level? I know (hope) I have the willpower to push through this, but I really just need a mental timeframe so that I have something to look forward to. 

I really appreciate any help at all in this manner.

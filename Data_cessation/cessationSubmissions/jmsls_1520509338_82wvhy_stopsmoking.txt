Keep reminding yourself, that you're doing something really great!

I just wanted to remind everyone how great they are for quitting tobacco:

You're great because you're choosing to be healthy.

You're great because you're accepting your situation and taking responsibility.

You're great because you're making your friends and family happy by becoming a better person.

You're great because you're helping to destroy the evil tobacco industry.

You're great because you're not annoying people with your smoke, not showing children bad examples, and you aren't smelling really bad.

You're great because you're choosing to become confident and happy.

You're great because even though quitting is difficult, you made it through the first hour, day, week or month. Some people never get as far as you do.

You're great because without you guys on this subreddit I would have found quitting much more difficult!

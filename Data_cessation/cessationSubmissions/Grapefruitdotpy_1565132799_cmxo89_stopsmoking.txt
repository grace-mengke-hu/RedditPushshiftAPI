Need an explanation

So I read and hear very often that people go back to smoking, even if they have been clean for months or even years.
This thought is making me feel very uncomfortable. If I am having hard cravings even after a few months without smoking, I would accept my fate as a smoker. 
So could you explain how people relapse after, letâ€™s say, 1 month being smoke free?

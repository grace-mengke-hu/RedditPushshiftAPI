Kickin' The Habit.

As of typing this post I've had my last cigarette. No more. I'm not only doing this for myself, but for my family & so I'm not wasting $100+ a week on crap when I could be buying new shiny things.

Has anyone got any tips/help on what the first week will be like?

My fianc√© is quitting too. We decided this afternoon that enough is enough. We've each set a goal of 2 weeks without smoking = we get to treat ourselves to something nice.

Is 2 weeks too optimistic?

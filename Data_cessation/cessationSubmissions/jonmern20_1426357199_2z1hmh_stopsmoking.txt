I could use some advice.

I'm rolling up my last 30-40 cigarettes and I am getting anxious. I used a Christmas Amazon gift card to buy rolling papers and a roller in January. All the stuff I needed to learn to roll my own. For two years, I've donated plasma to pay for smoking ($55 a week, $45 gone to cigarettes) and I've had some serious health issues because of it. When I started rolling, the amount I was spending per week dropped from $45 to about $10, so I donated a couple more times and stocked up on enough tobacco to last for months; I stopped donating altogether early February.


Well, my stash is almost at an end and there is no way in hell I'm going to donate plasma again and deal with the fatigue, lightheadedness and all that jazz. Ive gone through withdrawals before, I even quit for a year entirely at one point, and it never gets easier to give it up.


I'm glad I found this subreddit. Alot of posts I read are comforting, especially the 'over-a-year-now' posts. My question is this: What is your best way to distract yourself from the urge? I know gum, raw carrots, and exercise help, but I've never found anything to distract me completely. I'm not looking forward to the raging, especially since I'm living with family who have never smoked and just think Im an asshole when I don't smoke. I'm outright ignored when I'm out of cigarettes, but I can't blame them because if they talked to me I'd likely snarl or shout. Please and thank you, /r/stopsmoking.

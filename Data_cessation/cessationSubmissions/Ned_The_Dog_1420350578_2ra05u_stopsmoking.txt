Stressful day, didn't smoke!

I am so fucking proud of me!  Today is 90 days sober for me.  I've been feeling pretty down in the dumps this week about not drinking, and at my AA meeting tonight I was crying uncontrollably.  Usually when I cry or have a terrible day, I'll chain smoke a few cigarettes to 'feel better.'

I was craving a smoke soooooo bad after the meeting.  BUT I DIDN'T DO IT!  I reminded myself that whether I smoked or didn't smoke, my emotions and feelings would still be there.  Smoking wouldn't make me feel better, it would only make me crave more nicotine.  It would undo the 48 hours worth of detox I've done.  

I gotta say today was a good day.

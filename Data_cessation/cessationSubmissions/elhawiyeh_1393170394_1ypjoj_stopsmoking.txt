Currently wrestling with the desire to go buy a pack. Need advice.

I have a fairly addictive personality. Typically, in the past, I've replaced one vice for another. I rationalize by saying that I have a stressful job (military), and that I work hard and play hard. 

But right now, I'm going cold turkey, and I want a smoke so bad my hands are shaking. My motivation has gone down the shitter, and the inability to distract myself from my issues combined with my withdrawal is leaving me a bit of a wreck.

I smelled flowers today.

I don't mean I stopped to smell them. I knew they were there before I saw then because I could actually smell something from a distance. I can't remember the last I smelled something light clearly.

Food is tasting better too, and that's always a plus.

Edit: Just realized I'm over 40 days as well! Yay!

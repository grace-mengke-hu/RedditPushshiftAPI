I came to Singapore for my dad's surgery and haven't smoked for 11 days. But seeing people smoking in the streets makes so tempted!

When ever I see people smoking, I immediately start to fantasize about smoking when I go back home. 

I will say this though. There was a day prior to the 11 days I caved and had 3 cigs in an hour after 4 days of not smoking. I immediately got acne and found it hard to breathe for the rest of the day. Goes to show how fucked my lungs are usually when I'm constantly smoking pot and cigs all day every day.

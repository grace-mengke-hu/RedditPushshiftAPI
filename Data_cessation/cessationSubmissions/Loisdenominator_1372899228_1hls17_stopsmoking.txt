What words have stayed with you?

A few days in and I find myself thinking of some words that stuck with me.

I think it may have been me who said to a friend "no good can come of it (smoking)". True words. 

My doctor told me at my last checkup "studies show the more you attempt to quit, the greater the chances you will quit". I have my next checkup at the end of August and I can't wait to tell her that I've quit. 

Any words that have stayed with you?

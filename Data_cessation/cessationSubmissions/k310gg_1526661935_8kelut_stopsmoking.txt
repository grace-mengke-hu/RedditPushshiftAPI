One Week...This Time it Feels Real!

This Sub is the absolute bee's knees Y'all. I am super grateful. I discovered it last week when I decided in the moment to quit again. I was an off and on again smoker for about ten years, alternating between a pack a day to a pack a week to vaping to smoking black 'n milds when I thought it would be okay. They are fucking gross. It all stinks, and vaping increases your douchiness bt a full degree of magnitude. 

I come here sometimes to ride out a craving. Also, been doing sets of 12-20 pushups or jumping jacks to help with dopamine. Today I actually feel productive at work and able to focus. 

I am not a smoker, and you all helped me reach that. Thank you!!!

Need help to quit whilst drinking.

Hi, so I've lurked on this sub reddit for a while and I have to say the advice you give each other is awesome, however finally I need some of my own.

About 2 months ago I "quit" and I say it like that as I never even attempted to quit whilst out drinking. The giving up smoking during the day/at work wasn't incredibly difficult (it wasn't easy either) but whilst out it wasnt even an option. Now I have started a new job and let myself start again!

As of tomorrow I will "quit" again however I was wondering if you guys/girls had any tips on how to get over that last hurdle and not give in whilst having a drink? I think if I can get through 1 weekend without a smoke I think i can finally regard myself as an ex smoker, something I haven't done yet!

I appreciate your help in advance.

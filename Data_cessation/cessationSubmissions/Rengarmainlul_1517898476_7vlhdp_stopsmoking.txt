Wanna stop smoking and start vaping but not sure about something.

Recently, I've been smoking alot, cigarettes and a tabaco named dokha everyday. Because of this, I've been feeling tired everytime I get back home, even if I sleep for 2 hours and then wake up I'm still tired and sometimes I can't even wake up. I searched up why and it was because of nicotine and the chemicals in cigarettes. I've already planned that I'm going to stop smoking but I want to start vaping. I have a vape with e-juice that doesn't contain any nicotine, my question is, if I stop smoking dokha/cigarettes and start vaping with no nicotine am I still going to feel tired and sleepy everyday or will it not affect me ?

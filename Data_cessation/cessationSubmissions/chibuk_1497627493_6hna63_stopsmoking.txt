Want to reduce smoking using your smartwatch! Receive points towards Starbucks or Amazon $ as you quit.

We developed a smartwatch app which helps people quit smoking, on Android Wear 2.0 (atm), here is how it works:


-> we automatically detect when a person smokes (motion recognition)

-> from here you are suggested a best time to smoke next (we slowly increase their time to their next cigarette)

-> when you wait until after the suggested time you receive points which can be converted into Starbucks or Amazon credits

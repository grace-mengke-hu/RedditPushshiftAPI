Anyone else experiencing "quitter's flu?"

My body has felt progressively better everyday, until about day 6 and my sinuses are just draining fluid constantly. I've read this can be called "quitter's flu," and is just part of the body re-regulating itself. 

It seems mileage varies between people, so I was curious if anyone else experienced these cold-like symptoms and about how long it took to push through for you.

I will say that it has strengthened my resolve further for quitting. Going through this once is obnoxious. Putting myself through it a second time would be just plain dumb.

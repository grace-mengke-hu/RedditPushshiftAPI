Vent

I went to visit a friend out of town today. Two hour train journey each way. All was great except for one thing. She's still smoking, when she told me she quit. None of my business except I would have like to have known before going. She smoked six cigarettes in five hours. And she's pregnant and she smoked with her other kid in the car. I said nothing. She knows how I feel about the pregnant smoking thing. So having not said anything all day, I needed to say something now. And my hair stinks now and I just washed it this morning and my clothes stink.

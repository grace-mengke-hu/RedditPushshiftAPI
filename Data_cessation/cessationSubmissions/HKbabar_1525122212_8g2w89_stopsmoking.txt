Struggling, how do I not smoke for 24 hours?

Need to quit, but struggling to get through the first 24 hours. 

I've quit cold turkey many times, but will come back to it very easily. If I can get through a day then I can get through life without another puff. 

I already smoked today, but I'm determined to have today be my last. 

How do I get through tomorrow? 

Work with smokers and living with a smoker, cigarettes are always near me, my SO is hiding his cigarettes, and I've stopped buying them, but I keep getting them. Need help to stop!

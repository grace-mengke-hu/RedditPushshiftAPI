Had a lot of people passing away last time I quit, it was too much for me to handle. But now I'll be at two weeks tomorrow.

I tried quitting the last quarter of this deployment but we lost two people in a SVBIED, and my aunt passed away with her struggle to breast cancer. 

But now that things have settled down, It's become much easier to quit. Things are wrapping up and within the next month I should have a drink in my hands instead of my rifle. 

Thank you everyone!

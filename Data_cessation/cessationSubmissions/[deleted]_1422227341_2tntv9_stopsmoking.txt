18 years old, been smoking for 1,5 years or so. Never been able to quit for longer than 1-2 weeks, let's quit for good now!

I've tried so often to quit smoking only to buy a new pack after about 1 week. Longest streak of not smoking I've ever achieved is 2 weeks. Last friday night was the last time I've smoked. I smoked an entire pack in one day and felt like absolute shit the day after. Let's keep that the last time I've smoked so everytime I crave a cigarette I can think about how crappy I felt.

Today was day 1

I've recently been trying to quit smoking, but have only been playing with the idea up until today. Today was the first day that I didn't smoke ONE cigarette, and it feels good. I'm starting a new job this week so hopefully that will help me get through the toughest few weeks.

Wish me luck!

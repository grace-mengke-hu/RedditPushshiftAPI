So I was hanging out with some mates...

...and one of them rolled up a joint and passed it around. I don't smoke (pot) a lot but like to indulge occasionally, oh and here we roll joints with tobacco. I knew I shouldn't but I had had a beer and really fancied a toke, so I took it. I felt bad, was thinking about having to reset my badge just when I was about to hit 1 month - I even said out loud "I am so gonna regret this", but still went ahead and put that sucker in my mouth and took a long deep drag. Felt good to get a buzz but it was at the high price of feeling like a complete failure on my quit attempt. I knew exactly what I was doing, nicotine is nicotine and this was me back to square one. By the end of the night, the small gathering had turned into a bit of a party, and I remember sitting on a bench outside with my best friend, smoking a cigarette. This is how it goes, you think one sneaky toke doesn't count, but by the end of the night you've somehow worked your way through half a pack. Someone else's pack too, just to add to your shame. I was looking at the lit cigarette in my hand and telling him "damn I was doing so well, I nearly had a star, I'm gonna have to start all over again". When all of a sudden...

I woke up! My first smoking dream this time around, and man that shame and sense of failure was so real, you cannot imagine the RELIEF I felt when I realised it was 3am and I was in bed and none of it happened!! Woohooooo!!! And for it to happen today of all days, one month officially done baby, BOOM! Helloooo pretty star :)

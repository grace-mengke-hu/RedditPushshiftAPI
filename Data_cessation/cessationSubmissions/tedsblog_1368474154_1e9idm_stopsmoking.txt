Two years ago today I quit smoking for the last time.

I'd quit smoking a million times before. Hell, I used to joke that I quit every night before I went to bed, but just picked it up again in the morning.

That is the past. On 5/13/11, I had my and am a better person for having done so.

For those of you who are in the first month or two of quitting: IT. GETS. BETTER. I promise.

Those first few months, where your scumbag brain is telling you that just one cigarette, just one puff, isn't that bad and it's not really cheating (it's just gonna help get through this tough patch) is exactly that; a scumbag. Don't listen to the scumbag brain. Think of the new smells you're experiencing, the new tastes that you're having, the fact that you can walk 100 fucking yards without being out of breath. Those are what you should be considering when your cravings get too intense.

If I could quit after a 22-year, pack-a-day habit, you can. I know you can do it. I **KNOW** you're stronger than a fucking tube of paper, plant, and cotton. I believe in you and the fact that you're doing the right thing for yourself and your family.

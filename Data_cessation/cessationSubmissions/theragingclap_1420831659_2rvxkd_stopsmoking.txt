24 hours free, having quit twice in the last 20 years for 6 months and failed, I am doing it the Allen Carr way.

First time I quit was 2003 and I used alcohol replacement for when the smoking cravings hit, I won but only for 6 or 7 months till I let myself fall back in to the world of smoking.

Second attempt was August 2013 and I quit using a vape which I threw away after about four weeks of use and lasted until February 2014.

I just read Allen Carr's book and have to say although I am only 24 hours in, I know I am a non smoker now. I am in a totally different place psychologically than before. I embrace these cravings as the withering of my chronic addiction, I am riding the wave and urging it on. The book is beautifully concise, I chose not to smoke from about page 30 onwards and felt more confident that it was my need to think about my relationship with smoking more deeply as the book progressed and sincerely now as I approach 40 years old I know I have finally won.

If you are struggling to quit and haven't read Allen Carr, do it today, and good luck!

Nicotine Replacement Therapy can be Dangerous

Disclaimer: If you recently quit smoking and need NRT to get through the first few weeks, that is completely reasonable. My post here is about how NRT can lead to being even more addicted to nicotine and make it easier for you to relapse back to smoking. 

I've quit smoking several times over the past six years and each time I would go back to nicotine gum, hoping I will never smoke again. The problem is that I've been addicted to nicotine gum for almost 2 years now. As you can see my badge says "27 days" for my last cigarette. I think you can sense the problem. 

I've gone through this many times. Quit smoking, chew nicotine gum, bum a cigarette, start smoking, quit smoking, chew gum, etc etc. Using NRT is not a way out of nicotine addiction and for me, it aggravates my nicotine addiction.  A cigarette is always a more powerful hit of nicotine than the gum, so if I get frustrated and the gum isn't doing its job, I'll bum a cigarette. 

Would I be bumming a cigarette if I didn't chew the gum? It's unlikely. There were periods when I quit the gum and went to the gym instead. During those moments, I never felt the need for a cigarette until of course, I picked up the gum again.

Overall, be careful with NRT. The gum, lozenges, patches are not supposed to be used past 12 weeks. I've been chewing nicotine gum for 2 years. The only way to quit smoking/nicotine is to say goodbye forever. Replace an unhealthy habit with an abundance of healthy options such as exercise and healthy foods. 

Thanks for listening.

Going pretty good so far.

Hello /r/stopsmoking. 

If you haven't seen any of my posts yet, I recently quit smoking again. I quit for almost six months with the help of this forum, and then I got confident and stopped posting. Within a few months, I was back to smoking a pack a day again.

The last smoke I had was Sunday night. I had the last two days off with boyfriend, and those days were pretty easy. Now it's Wednesday and I am back at work. Obviously this place is one of my triggers and I can't help but have cravings. I have only been on shift for an hour, so I have seven more to go.

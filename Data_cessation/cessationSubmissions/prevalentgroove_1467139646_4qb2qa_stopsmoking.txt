First day free, thanks for the help getting here

Hey all - fair warning this is likely to be a bit big. I've done this sort of thing in journals before, listing pros and cons and self motivating and affirmations and all that, but in the end they're all just words on pages somewhere. This is a little more alive, and even if nobody else is involved I feel a little more...invested and accountable in all this.

So, today is my day 1. Last cigarette was some time yesterday afternoon. Picked up smoking in college, and since then I've averaged 2 or 3 packs a week, excepting when I was really depressed about my job and later kind of everything, bumped up to almost a pack a day recently. My ex-wife gives me little jabs if they come too frequently or too many, and for a while now I've really hated that it's a thing I do. Hate the taste, the smell, the stigma, the cost, the feeling in my mouth/throat/chest after one, or in my head after too many.

I kind of hated myself for being weak enough to give in, but I also kind of always make things harder for myself. Cigarettes made me feel like I had some struggle, that things weren't all fine and that on some level I was a shitty person for not having myself under control. I'd think about this and get pissed off, and then go have a smoke...

With good enough reasons I've been able to stop before, a weekend, a vacation, once even a whole month, but this time isn't a stop, this is the quit. This isn't because folks will judge me or I'll be camping or whatever, this is because it is time to end it.

So enough is enough. The die is cast, the Rubicon crossed and there is no turning back. Even though I've just been lurking on here the past few weeks, checking in as a tool and you all as a sounding board - if even a silent one - will be enough to get me through.

I'm sure I'll be around, checking in, needing and lending support. Thanks in advance, and also for getting me this far along.

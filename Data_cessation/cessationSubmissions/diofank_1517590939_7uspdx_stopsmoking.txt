Shitty day but I resisted

Today, everything went south. The computers at work were messed up, buses were late, trains were late, someone f***ed up my coffee, I didn't have time to have lunch, all the small thing building up to me being a nervous mess.

Anyway, I didn't cave. It crossed my mind to buy a pack "to relieve the stress and take a break" but I didn't. And you know what: I would've been even more stressed out had I smoked. If I had gone to the shops and bought a pack and a lighter, found a spot to smoke and smoked, 10-15 minutes of my time when I was already rushing through my day.

It's really not worth it. This has been one more day as a non-smoker and I'm loving it!

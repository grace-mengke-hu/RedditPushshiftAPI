It's easy to quit smoking, but...

I'm not trying to insult anybody. The quitting is so damn easy for me because I'm so damn good at it. Unfortunally, I'm very good at starting as well.

I first got addicted when I was 17, quit "sucessfully" first time when I was 20 (lasted a year). After that, it got even easier to quit. Guess it's about all the experience I made quitting so much.

It's nice to be good at quitting, but it makes it even harder to not begin smoking again. Because it's not really a big deal anymore. I can just quit when I get issues with it. The first two days can be a bit crappy, but after that, everything is back to normalish. I can smoke to days, weeks, months, but when I realize the addiction eat to much of the nicotine effects, I quit. For months or years, but always end up smoking again.

Guess everything become easier with experience. So I'm going to get better at not starting again.

So, how do you not start smoking?

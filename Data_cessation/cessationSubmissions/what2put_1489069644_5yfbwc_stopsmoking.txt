114 days without nicotine. 94 days without soda. I've gained 30 lbs and I am now a day walker.

My husband and I don't understand the weight gain. I'm pretty active and eat healthy. A friend of mine told me, "It gets better". When she quit, she was pregnant. So she doesn't quite know how much of this is normal. I know 80% of people gain weight when they quit. I'm just wondering if it drops back off? I'm also 6'1 so 30 lbs is carried well. My gut just feels so bloated so often. 

Guys, does this get better? Does it go away? 

Thanks for any feedback!

Working on it!

I always fail with gum cold turkey patch ect. I decided id try vaping to see if that would help, and so far it has!

Im a 40-45 cigarette smoker a day. On a bad day I can hit 3 packs of Newport. Its fricken gross. Ive been doing this for like 15 years now!

Anyways I started vaping Tuesday morning and I had 8 cigarettes on Tuesday and 8 on Wednesday. So far today ive had 3!

Im hoping by the end of the month ill be around 0! 

Anyone else quit this way? Happy thanksgiving!

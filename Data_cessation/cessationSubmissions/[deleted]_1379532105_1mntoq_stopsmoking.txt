I've switched to a vaporiser, I think these things are more addictive than cigarettes..

I've been without a cigarette for 6-7 days now, I'm quite proud of this fact and I'm telling myself "good job for quitting" but I haven't really achieved anything. I'm still as addicted to nicotine as before, and now that I can use my vaporiser in work, on the train, and whilst sat at home I must be having the equivalent of 30 cigs a day now.

It's like swapping one addiction for another, albeit slightly less harmful.

I can honestly now say that the thought of lighting a cigarette turns my stomach a bit, the smell alone would put me off, but other than the smell the other side effects will remain: mood swings, attention span, stamina, irritability, increased blood pressure, etc.

Has anyone else become hooked on vaping going from cigarettes?

38 days not a single puff, but the dreams.. lol

i was smoking two packs a day easy, im 28 and have been smoking since i was 13, quit cold turkey, not a single puff or vape or any form of nicotine (im very proud of that lol), but MAN, the dreams are insane, and by insane i mean they seem SO real, i never used to remember my dreams or anything, but now it seems like every time i wake up (or at least the last week) i have this feeling that i relapsed and have been smoking a few cigs here and there, and its because i do it in my dreams, i always find a half cig in an ash tray and light it up, or by the time i realize whats going on i have a pack with like 10 cigs missing and im like "WOW did i smoke all of these!?" and i get so disappointed in myself and then i just.. wake up and realize im still nicotine free lmao, it only controls me in my sleep as of right now, anyways, just thought id share, my friends dont seem to get how crazy it is, but i figured some people on here would know what im talking about, thanks for reading, love the community here, keep it up people, stay strong

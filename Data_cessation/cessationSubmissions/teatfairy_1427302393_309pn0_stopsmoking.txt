Well I caved after a day and learned something...

I smoked and realized the desire to not confront feelings was stronger than the desire to smoke. I haven't felt those feelings since I was 13 (when I started smoking) I missed two classes and couldn't get off the couch. This is much deeper than I thought...

I'll be talking with my therapist about all this. I don't think I can do this without therapy. I'll be putting a new patch on today and calling my therapist. There is some really dark stuff I need to work out.

I just hate having to change my badge and quit date on my app. I'm pretty upset right now.

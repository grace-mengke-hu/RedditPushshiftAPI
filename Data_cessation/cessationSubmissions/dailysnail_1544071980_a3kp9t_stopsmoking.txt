Does weed count?

I’m three days into quitting weed (and I guess the tobacco that I smoke with it as well). Im used to smoking about an eighth a day, and just recently admitted to myself how dangerously unrealistic of a habit that is to keep up. Smoking has had measurable effects on my school work, relationships with people, and even my personality (I think). I finally realized I’m BAD at moderation, something I truly want to work on. After trying to limit my smoking to smaller quantities or certain times, nothing was changing. I would make excuses for myself in the moment and smoke, and then feel shitty about myself an hour later (causing me to smoke again). It’s a cycle I need to break if I want to graduate college this year and join the working world. I finally feel ready to do this and gain some control over my life. 

So far I’ve been combatting every negative and repressed emotion that Ive always avoided by smoking. It’s  hard not to just spiral downwards into a sadness hole (especially at nighttime) but if I’m being honest with myself, it feels relieving to experience these negative emotions. I haven’t been treating my life the way it deserves, and I think my brain just needed to catch up to that fact. Experiencing the sadness and anxiety that comes with identifying my problems has really helped me begin to assess my goals. Even after just a few days I feel more motivated and can already see some positive results. I hope that the more I experience these positive changes, the less desire I have to smoke again.

I am determined to be successful in quitting, and would love to support others in this group who feel the same.

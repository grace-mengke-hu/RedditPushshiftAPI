I have been smoke free for 5 months and my cravings are getting worse...

I used the patch for a few weeks, and I'm on Wellbutrin (for other reasons, but definitely helped with quitting). After the first month it seemed to get easier over time, but the last few weeks have been rough. I've been thinking about it daily and I feel closer to giving up than I have since quitting...

It's clear to me that it's stress related. It feels like a cigarette would just make all my problems so much more manageable, and my stress so much less overwhelming.

I really really don't want to start smoking again. I hated being addicted, I hated smelling, I hated having to time my life around cigarettes, I hated how my skin looked, I hated imagining myself at 70 dying of lung cancer because of some idiotic decision I made at 18. My boyfriend quit at the same time and we have both been totally smoke free and supportive of each other.

I don't want to be a smoker... I just want a cigarette! Am I going to feel like this every time I get stressed out for the rest of my life? :/

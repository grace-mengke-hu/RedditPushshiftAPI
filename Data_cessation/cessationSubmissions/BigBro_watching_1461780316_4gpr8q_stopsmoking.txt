Can't stop my 4-5 cigarettes a day habit.

I know, a lot of you are or have been "pack a day" smokers. I'm addicted to my 4-5 cigs a day and can't stop.

1. Beginning of the day

2. Before work

3. During work

4. After work

Sometimes a 5th one thrown in on a stressful day.

I have AWFUL post nasal drip every day and I know quitting will help that too. It's hard in the restaurant industry though.

Sounds easy because it's 1/4 of a pack, but it's not...I want to start running again, could that help?

Question about my chest

This is probably the wrong sub, but i couldn't really find the right place to post this so yeah, sorry. Moving on, I started smoking about a month ago, and im not exactly a heavy smoker, some days i might have 5, some days one or even none. Anyways, I notice that everytime I lie down and beath fairly heavily I get a kinda pain in my upper chest in the centre around where my collar bone is. I was wondering if anyone knew if this could be related to the smoking or not, and if so what I would need to do to make it go away. Any comments and advice would be much appreciated.

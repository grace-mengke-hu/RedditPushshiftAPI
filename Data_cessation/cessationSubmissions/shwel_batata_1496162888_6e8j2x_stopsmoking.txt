This is too easy, am I missing something?

I just got married 2 weeks ago. On our honeymoon, I smoked 5 cigarettes in 10 days. Before that I used to smoke 1 pack per day. I thought it's because it's a vacation I'm not really suffering too much without it, but I also thought the cravings would come back after I get back to normal life. 

Vacation is over now and I haven't touched a cigarette in 3 days now and I threw out the "Spare" pack I was keeping. Throwing that out made things a lot easier because now I don't even need to make a decision to smoke a "you-deserve-this" cigarette.

This is all seeming too easy, I thought quitting would be harder, my other attempts were so unsuccessful. Is it because I'm in a happy place in my life?  Don't get me wrong, I'd love to light one up right now, but it's not the first thing I think about in the morning as it has been for the last 5 years.

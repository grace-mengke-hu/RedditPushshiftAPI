Quiting cold turkey

I've been smoking any a pack a day for a month before then I wasnt smoking at all except for a brief time ten years ago.  I plan on going cold turkey tomorrow and have to work possibly Thursday definitely Friday this week. How do you feel quitting I work in healthcare and presentation is important, though smoking like this hasn't been doing much favors in that department.

3 weeks! Thanks everyone and Merry Christmas!

I mostly lurked here while I was still smoking.  I found it helped that this subreddit constantly showed up on my front page with all your stories and comments.  Reading all of your helpful suggestions sure has made it easier on me to stop smoking!  I found it was easier to quit after being sick for a few days and when I felt better just deciding to quit cold turkey.  Thank you all!

Can't stop... eating!!

I'm on my fifth day and, as the title says, I've clearly replaced my smoking habit with food. That's okay for a little while, as I can afford to gain *a little bit* of weight, but DAMN!! I haven't had an appetite like this since high school. 

Anyone else feel like this when they quit? Does is last forever? I really don't want to get fat. :(

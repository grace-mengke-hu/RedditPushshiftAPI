Convinced I smoked last night

I woke up thinking I smoked last night. The memory was so vivid that it took most of the morning to realize I had dreamed about a post I read earlier on this sub from a user who stated they took a couple puffs and threw the smoke out when overcome by shame. The /u had been quit for months and I felt bad because of how much work had been wasted by that lapse in discipline. I hadn't realized how much I internalized the post. I don't even remember the dream. I had to step back through my day and reassure myself that at no point in the day did I have or ask for a smoke. I'm so proud  of my progress. I can only infer that I must be disappointed about something else in my life, but maybe it is just a withdrawal symptom. Anyone experience vivid smoke dreams?

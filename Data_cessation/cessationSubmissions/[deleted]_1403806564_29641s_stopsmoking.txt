6 Packs a Day...

I never smoked. I have asthma and it's very literally an instant attack if I take a single puff. A friend said "What about this? Try it. There's no smoke." 

That's how I started dipping.

I dipped the nicotine equivalent of approximately six packs (or 120 cigarettes) per day, every day, for 8 years. At 26, last year, I was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation. 

As of yesterday I have foregone the equivalent of 2956 cigarettes by becoming nicotine free for an entire month. My heart no longer pounds at rest. I don't sweat for no reason. My blood pressure is perfect and my doctor is beginning to wean me off of my heart medication. 

I still crave nicotine. I was told that around week 3 things would get much easier. For me, this 31st day isn't any easier than the first one. Luckily, I still want to quit just as bad.    

Thank you all.

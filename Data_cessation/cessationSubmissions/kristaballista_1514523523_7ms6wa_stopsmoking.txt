1m24d while all heck breaks loose (venting)

The past two months of my life have been an absolutely wretched, unbelievably painful cluster of days. First, my mother was checked into a 24-hr in-patient therapy center. I was excited for her to get help but also feeling incredibly  guilty I was on the other side of the country. Not now, exactly but more that I have been for so long. 
My father confided in me that he believes his second marriage is on the rocks. He’s scared of being alone. Of dying alone. I have no idea what to tell him, simply that “I’m here.”
I told my boyfriend of 3 years/best friend of 14 that I would be leaning on him for a bit of emotional support, as my own mental health issues (clinical depression, anxiety disorder) had been flaring up as well. Apparently, this was the straw that broke the camel’s back because he broke up with me days later. No warning. No discussion. No trying to work it out. Just done. And I hate to sound braggy about a couple that doesn’t even exist anymore but EVERYONE (except him) was sure we were getting married, having kids, dogs, building a beautiful Craftsman home together, all of it, which made it all the more bewildering. But then again he also screamed at me that my love is worthless, so...yeah...
Things got so bad, I was going to kill myself. I got as far as buying the bottle of Tylenol PM. I’m so, so glad one of my roommates came home and even more glad she’s a compassionate, wonderful human. 
The very next day, my father tells me my little sister tried to kill herself. She “can’t know (I) know” so I can’t talk with her about it. This reeeeeally breaks my heart.
Next day, my ex/boss (sorta) asks me to come in to  work. With him. Three days after he dumped me. I come in because 1) I’m stupid, 2) a masochist, and 3) I like/need money. I’m a freelancer, so I could have turned the work down but I didn’t because I’m saving up for a tattoo and I hate myself. Later that day, I get a call. Family friend/honorary aunt has passed away.
There’s been a lot of crying. Like vast ocean planets of tears, y’all. And it was all extra-ugly crying. There’s been binge-watching and feelings-eating, screaming at the wall and staring at the wall, both ordering and staying in, both take out and going out. But you know what there hasn’t been?

Fucking cigarettes. 😎

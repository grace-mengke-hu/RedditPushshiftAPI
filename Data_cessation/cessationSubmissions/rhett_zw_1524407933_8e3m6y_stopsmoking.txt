I've cut the chord.

I've had enough of this addiction. I've logged my quit time and I'm very excited to get down this path. I have no idea how it's going to feel or how long it will be until the cravings dissipate. But, I do know there is zero reason to smoke and I'll take the rest as it comes. 

Thanks for setting up this sub, great to have others out there! Here's to a new leaf after 12 years of stupidity.

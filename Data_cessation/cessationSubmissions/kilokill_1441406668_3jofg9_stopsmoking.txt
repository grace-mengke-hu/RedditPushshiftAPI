Checking Back In...

So, I felt like I should write this.. I quit for a while after I moved away from NYC.. then.. I recently caved in again [Fucking caved in : stopsmoking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/35e4lk/fucking_caved_in/) and I won't lie, shit has been tumultuous in my life.. and following that post, I kept smoking... 

I fucking hated myself everytime.. to the point, that I would buy a whole pack, smoke a few and throw the rest out.. sometimes, I would only smoke 1 and throw the rest of the pack out. Yes, actions of an addict more or less and it cost me a lot, both financially and otherwise.

Anyway, I recently picked up a proper vaping device and it has more or less changed my current situation. I'm still going through a bunch of shit in my life.. I still feel like "smoking"... but after I picked up this device, I can't bring myself to smoke another cigarette. The other day, I even bought a pack.. I started smoking my first cig and goddamn did it taste disgusting.. I threw the whole pack out.. that is when I knew, I am never buying another pack again. 

Now, whenever I feel the urge, I hit my vaping device up that has 11mg of nicotine in the juice.. It doesn't taste like shit, and I don't hate myself after using it. When my personal situation is better, I want to cease the vaping as well..but its lesser of the 2 evils for me right now.. if it is an evil at all.

Anyway.. you guys have been my support structure that had always reminded me to stop smoking before and after I relapsed. I felt like I should drop a line to update and thank you all.

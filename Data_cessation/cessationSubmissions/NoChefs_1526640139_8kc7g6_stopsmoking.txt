What now

So the past couple of days I've gradually cut down from more then a half pack a day habbit to just one ciggaret a day and I don't think I can quit just yet its so hard I smoke my cig before I go to sleep cause I cannot sleep without it. I've been smoking for about 2 years now and I want to stop but can't. So I'm open to suggestions.

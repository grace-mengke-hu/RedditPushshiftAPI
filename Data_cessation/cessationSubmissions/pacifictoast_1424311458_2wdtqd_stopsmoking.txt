212 Days free

212 days smoke free. The cravings are long gone.

I'm going to be able to keep this up (and you can too) because we know that we can never have one drag again, one cigar, one pipe smoke, one anything. Some rare people can, we know we're not them and won't try, it's too great being a non-smoker.

Thanks for everything /r/stopsmoking! /u/pacifictoast out!

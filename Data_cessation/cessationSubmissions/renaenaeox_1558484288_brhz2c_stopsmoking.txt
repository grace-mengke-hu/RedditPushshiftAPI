This is so asinine.. but I worry I won’t be as “cool” as I used to be if I don’t smoke.

It’s been 4 days. I’m still marginally dying. This sucks so much but I’m determined to make this time my last time. I had the thought today that maybe I won’t be as cool as I was as a smoker, whatever that means. Is it the addiction playing tricks on me? This stinks!

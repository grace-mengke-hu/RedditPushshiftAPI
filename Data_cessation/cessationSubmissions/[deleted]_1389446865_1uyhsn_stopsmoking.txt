day 5! Still going strong

Hello /r/stopsmoking! 

I'm just dropping by to say that I went out drinking yesterday without smoking a singe cigarette!! I got about blackout drunk but still managed to tell my self that "if I can't go out drinking without smoking, i simply cannot go out drinking at all". And it worked, even though I had the worst cravings. 

That's it. Keep on the good work, people and have a nice weekend! 
See you

Some Brotherly Advice

Some advice my brother gave me today about quitting: 

"The way I looked at it when I 'quit' is not that I quit smoking for good it's just that I don't smoke. If someone asks you if you want to smoke it's much better to say I don't smoke rather than I'm quitting." 

I had never considered this, but it's definitely true for me. Saying you're quitting seems to open up the dialogue that you could have "just one more" or "well if you change your mind I'll bum you one", whereas saying you don't smoke shuts down the topic completely. It's a great way to avoid unnecessary temptation especially when drinking. Hopefully some of you find this useful!

Quitting for dental health reasons

I'm disgusted with how little I've been looking after myself. Inconsistent teeth brushing plus 5 years smoking has put some wear on my gums and teeth. Quite sad really since I have pretty a pretty good set of teeth. They don't look eroded but I worry at the difference from before smoking and hope that they'll be able to make a bit of a comeback. I'm 24 so they aren't too badly damaged but I have slight fangs which will only look worse if I continue smoking.
This is probably a somewhat superficial reason but only recently I've began realizing how out of breath I am and I'm more aware of the damage as time goes on. Thankfully my ecigarette is doing wonders, it hasn't been difficult refraining from them the last couple of days and I don't plan on counting as it messes with my OCD.

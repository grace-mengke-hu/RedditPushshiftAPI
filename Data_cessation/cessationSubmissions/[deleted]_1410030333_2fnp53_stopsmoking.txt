Husband is unbearably crabby while not smoking. What can I do to help?

This is the first time I've visited this sub and I'm on mobile so sorry if this is a topic that's discussed frequently, but...

Oh my GOD my husband can be such a crabby jerk when he tries to quit smoking! This is his third attempt with the patch, second attempt with help from a vaporizer. I am so very proud of him but how do I deal with his cranky mood?!

I don't smoke cigarettes. I get that it's extremely difficult to quit. I am a recovering alcoholic and I quit drinking cold turkey for him (and myself). Addiction is fucking hard, I know this. And I want to be there for him but so far the only thing I know to do is to just keep my mouth shut whenever he's pissed off at the littlest thing so that I don't upset him further. Is this best? Should I just listen to him rant and rave over the tiniest issues (like the laptop being a little slow) and let him be? It makes me cringe hearing him be so angry but I don't want to say anything in case I make it worse. 

I'm glad he's not smoking but goddamn man, I hate that he's so irritable all the time now. 

What do you prefer your SO to do while you quit?

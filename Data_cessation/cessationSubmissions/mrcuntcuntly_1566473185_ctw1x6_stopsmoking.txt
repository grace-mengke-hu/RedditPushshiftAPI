Fighting mental addiction to cigarettes.

I have been a smoker for now close to 12 years, tried to quit twice, and both times I relented after 3 months, I don't care about the nicotine or the so called buzz factor, but I am strongly addicted to them mentally, when ever I try to quit, I dream of the bastards ffs, nothing I do can stop me from thinking about them. I smoke at minimum 2 packs a day, and when the money is not tight 3 packs is average. I want to quit because my health is getting worse, but the moment I put the cigarettes down, my brain goes haywire.
The reason I am writing this is, if anyone has any real advice on how to not succumb after months of not smoking, I would gladly appreciate it, because I also quit drinking a year ago, and I did not struggle with quitting booze even remotely as I do with smoking, and I never get as an intense urge to drink again as I do with cigarettes. 
Thank you! :)

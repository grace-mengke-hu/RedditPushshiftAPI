Just checking in, almost at 9 months!

Dang, it's almost been 9 months since my last smoke.  It's still tough sometimes, but I feel like I've won some major battles in this war.  

Things i've noticed:

Pros:
I'm way less depressed.
I have a job. 
Moving around isn't difficult. 
I didn't get my usual 4 month long chronic winter cough.
I've stopped smoking pot without really thinking about it.

Cons (in the interest of full disclosure):
I'm slightly less social because I've taken away that social crutch. I've put on a couple pounds (nothing crazy). Work is more stressful without smoke breaks and nothing really does the trick like a smoke. 

The pros heavily outweigh the cons, and I'm so happy that I've quit.  It's gotten way easier and I'm only craving a couple times a week now, and the cravings are brief and fleeting. 

What worked for me: bragging to all my friends about how many days I'd gone without a smoke.  This did 2 things.  It allowed me to basically fish for positive reinforcement, and also made my mission public, so that it would be way more embarrassing if I failed.  That being said, by the 3 month mark, my friends were pretty tired of it. 

Thanks r/stopsmoking! Couldn'ta dunnit withoutcha. The biggest lesson I learned here was 

**You have to learn to be okay with wanting something but not having it. Don't be a baby.**

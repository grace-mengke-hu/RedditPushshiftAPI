7 days and I'm feeling weak. Help, Reddit!


I quit last Monday after a failing tons of times. But I somehow know this is it. That I'm not failing this time. All these seven (Six?) days, I haven't had a bad pang. But something happened at work today and I'm fully fucking tensed. This is my weak moment, dear Reddit. Even before I go smoke one up, I know i'm going to regret it. I really dont wanna do it. Help!    
    
EDIT: I lived through the day. Thank you all. You people are amazing. I might be a stranger to you, but you all touched my life in a way. Sorry I couldn't respond earlier.

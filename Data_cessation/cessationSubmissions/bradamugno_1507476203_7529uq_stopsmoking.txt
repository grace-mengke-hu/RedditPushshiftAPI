Here's a tidy tip to help with cravings...

So I was out at a concert last night and after the show everyone piled out and lit up, I was surrounded my all the demon smokes everywhere I looked. I mean everywhere.... I even thought at one point my girlfriend had turned into a giant sized smoke! Then I had a craving as I'd had a few beers into the bargain. Instead of focusing on all the smokers though I picked out someone who wasn't smoking and told myself 'if they don't need to smoke then neither do I!' I maintained that mindset until the craving passed which was like 2 minutes and that was it, craving beaten. I was so chuffed with myself I treated myself to a chicken wrap! I knew it tasted extra nice as well as my mouth wasn't honking of smoke. Hope this helps someone struggling with cravings on nights out.

Day 10 with Champix - doing really well then M-i-L arrived who is a smoker ...

Hello,
I've been lurking here (my quitting app sent me!) but not contributing because I've been doing really well on the Champix. This is day 10 and last week I was super proud of myself.

My Mother-in-Law arrived to stay with us yesterday and I'm really struggling. She smokes and has basically taken up my old ritual (popping outside to the garage for a smoke). Seeing her do this is making me crave and mourn the smoking so much and because of this, I can't seem to think any of the ever-so happy thoughts I had last week. Is this a day 9/10 thing? Is it her? How on earth am I going to cope with this for the next six days without cracking. :-(

Moral support would be appreciated. Thank you.

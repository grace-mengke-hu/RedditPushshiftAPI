[X-Post from CMV] Smoking isn't THAT bad, right?

No, it's bad. It fucking sucks. But I'm starting to miss it. I've posted here before but am a little shy sticking with a conversation with scary strangers... but I'm trying again. 

I've grown up with smoking. I've lost my grandfather to cancer. Both sets of my parents smoke and told me now to, while holding cigarettes between their lips.
Long story short, I have smoked, quit and smoked and quit again. But JFC, I crave hard still. I enjoy being around smokers, I enjoy the smell (but I get that's brainwashing).
I want to start seeing this as a vile habit. I'm on r/stopsmoking but it hasn't helped to much. I want to stay off smoking, but I understand that I am not seeing the full harms, or comprehending them anyways. Please, scare the shit out of me.

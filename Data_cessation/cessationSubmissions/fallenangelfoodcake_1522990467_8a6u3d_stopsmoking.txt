One week Vape free.

I know this is a bit different from quitting cigarettes, but I am a week into not vaping and I feel horrible. My mood is anyone's guess, I am stressed beyond belief, and I hate it. Nicotene is nasty stuff to try and quit. Wish me luck, I'm at the end of my senior year in college and have a lot going on. I picked now to quit because if I can make it through this stressful of a time without caving I can do anything.

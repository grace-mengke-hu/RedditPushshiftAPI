Day one was easier than expected.

Yesterday was my first smoke-free day in three years. Sunday, I bought a nice vape for myself to use and ween myself off the nicotine and yesterday was my first day working, the real test of my resolve. It went well. I still went outside for smoke breaks with my lovely coworkers and didn't feel like I was missing anything with my pen. This morning I woke up, had my coffee, played with the pup, and also enjoyed my vanilla custard vapor.

The hardest part for me so far has been driving home, wanting to stop for "one last pack" on my way home and waking up from a dream where I know I bought cigarettes and nothing else. 

I look forward to the end of the day where my hair doesn't smell like smoke, my tongue isn't a funny color, and my hands smell like eJuice instead of american spirits. 

Today will be a good day.

Good luck to you all.

Quit smoking support buddy?

I am new to r/stopsmoking, trying to quit. I was wondering, does anyone think that maybe it would be a great idea to talk to the mods to set this up, but maybe we could get a buddy system started up. Someone you can either message on Reddit, text, or maybe use Kik messenger so we can have an accountability buddy. This has worked well in my life for certain things, when trying to accomplish a difficult task. Ideas?

Here I go again...any help appreciated !

After quitting for almost half a year in 2013, I picked it up again due to various reasons. The last 3-4 months have been the worst - I have been smoking like a chimney, and drinking as well. I threw away my last pack and am starting my streak here. Please help me stay on track. Thanks a lot !

EDIT: well that lasted for exactly 1 day. Then bought another pack and smoked about 7 cigs, threw it away and now trying again :)

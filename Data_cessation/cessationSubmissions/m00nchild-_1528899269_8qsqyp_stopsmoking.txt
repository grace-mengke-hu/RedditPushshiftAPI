I'M QUITTING RIGHT NOW. Who else is quitting today/this week?

I've smoked since I was 14, that's 6 years. I've done well with quitting before but always fall back into it. 

This time I want to focus on being a "gym bunny". How can I smoke if I'm into fitness? I've tried both before and it's just painful on my chest.

Let's fucking go. I don't want to be a smoker, I never have done.

What's your situation?

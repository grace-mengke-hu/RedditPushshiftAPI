What I won and lost because of smoking!! I quit in 2009 and made a goal to run a 1/2 marathon with my sister the following year. I did it and 3 more after that, I was so proud of myself, then I caved in and have been smoking since. Hard reminder of what I lost when it pops up in your memories on FB

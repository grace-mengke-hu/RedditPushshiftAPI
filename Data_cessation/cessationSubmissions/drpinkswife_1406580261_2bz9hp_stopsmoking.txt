37 Days Wooooo

I task myself with writing something everyday, so there is no significance in the 37 days. It just is.

So I saw my therapist today. Just before I left she asked me how the smoking was going...and I realised that it doesn't factor in anymore. I think I surprised her, because she said she was impressed that I stopped during such a stressful time. I started therapy again after 15 years because I hit a stress wall I could not get passed. I became unable to do anything productive. After a month I had a 'I think I'm having a heart attack' panic attack that sent me to the hospital and I never smoked another cigarette. I've had panic attacks, this was a whole new genre of panic attack and scary as hell.

So, I come here and I try to be really supportive. I can't really relate to NRT because I don't understand it. And if you have a lame excuse for not quitting like you have a party coming up, I'm probably not going to back you up on that decision. But anyone who honestly wants to quit and is ready to commit, I'm here, everyday before or after work and I will let you know what has worked for me. 

I have seen great benefits since quitting. It has also been a huge emotional roller coaster. So hang in there. If I can do this, at a time so stressful it stopped me in my tracks, you can do this. 

I love this place and thank you everyone who has been here on this ride with me! :))

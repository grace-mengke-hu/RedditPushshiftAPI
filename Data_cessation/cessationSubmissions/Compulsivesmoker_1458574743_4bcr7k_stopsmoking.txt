I seriously need help with smoking (50 cigarettes day)

Hi i need your help reddit... Im 21 year old male andI smoke over 50 cigarettes a day.
I really want to quit because i have constant cough. My lungs and throat hurt all the time. And i fear that with this pace i will get throat or lung cancer before im 25.
 I dont want to smoke anymore.
I tried campix. Didnt work. I tried nicotine patches, gums, inhalators you name it. But i cant stop smoking. 
Edit: I know this sounds stupid. But im trying to quit again. And 2-3 hours w/o cig.
Could someone please give me advice.
And AmA if you have questions.

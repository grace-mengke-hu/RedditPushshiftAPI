Any help would be appreciated

I'm 19 and have been smoking for around five years. I smoke about a pack and a half a per day. i want to quit may 26th. I'm weak, I've tried quitting cold turkey before and also with vaporizer e cigs. Nothing seems to work for me and I'm so tired of smoking. The smell, the taste, the feeling that I'm being judged by everyone, I want nothing to do with it anymore. I'm ready to quit, May 26th is hopefully my last day smoking.

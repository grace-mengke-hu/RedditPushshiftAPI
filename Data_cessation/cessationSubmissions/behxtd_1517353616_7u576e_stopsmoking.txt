So many failed attempts... I am lost.

I have been a pack a day smoker for 15 years.   3 years ago I quit cold turkey, and after the initial difficult phase I felt amazing.

For two years, I was so grateful that I quit and was the healthiest, happiest, and strongest I had ever been in my life.  My sports performance, work life, and social life all improved immensely.  For the first time as an adult I felt like the real me.

A cigar at a wedding started a downward spiral and I have been at a pack a day for a year.  My health and work are suffering majorly.   I failed again at quitting today, it has been about the 7th failure this past year.

I know I will be so much more content and strong if I can just quit again.  I donâ€™t know what is wrong with me.  Allen Carr, Wellbutrin, cold turkey, vaping, therapy... so many failures.  I am struggling and just needed to vent.

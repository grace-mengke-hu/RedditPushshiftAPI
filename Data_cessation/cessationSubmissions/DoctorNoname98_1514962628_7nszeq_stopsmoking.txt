Trying to have a relatively smoke free year

I smoked up until about 1 AM of the 1st.  If all goes well hopefully that's it, but the second day has been rough.  Part of me wants to switch from Cold Turkey to phasing out(I was at about 6-10 a day), but for now I think I'm going to try and stick with it.

Edit: since starting to use the quit now app, this is the first time I've reached 2 days!

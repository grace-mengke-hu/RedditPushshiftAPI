Feeling like a Champ !

Hey Guys, so I've smoked for around 4 years and in the last months almost a pack a day. 

Around 22 Days ago - i've quit, and all I can say is; I feel like a Champ. I've already saved so much money, that I could buy me a new pair of Sneakers and I am rocking them. I feel that the cravings get less and less and my mood gets boosted everyday. And even my Friends wonder why I am so upbeat since I quit! Btw - My Food tastes so good, it's Insane :)

Don't hesitate - just do it!

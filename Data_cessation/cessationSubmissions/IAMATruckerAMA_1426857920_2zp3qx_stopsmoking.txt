I've never been here before, but I quit a month ago. Sorry if I say something clich√©d.

I got a good vaporizer and that immediately replaced cigarettes for me. Now I can take hits whenever I want (rather than being committed to a whole cigarette) and there's all sorts of interesting flavors. I figure this is a pretty common thing to say, but I thought it would be a good idea to add to the movement for vaporizers.

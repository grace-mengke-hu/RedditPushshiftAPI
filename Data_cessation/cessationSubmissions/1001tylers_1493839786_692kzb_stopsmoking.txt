Here We Go Again

Back to day 1.
I'm so disappointed and frustrated.
However I am just going to try to learn from my mistakes and keep going.
I think I'm going to make sure I stick to a daily routine as that seemed to help. I think I'm also going to start working out in the evenings so that I can sleep.
I'm also going to make sure to work on my sleep hygiene as I think lack of sleep really contributes to losing my resolve.

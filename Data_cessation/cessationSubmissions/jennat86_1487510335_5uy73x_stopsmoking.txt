Easy way and wild mood swings

I know there's a large subset here that have been successful with Alan Carr's method. 

I too have had two long term (3 & 4 months) relatively enjoyable quits after reading the book.

Last week I spot read it again and made it to day 3 with little discomfort. I was enjoying the benefits (increased sense of taste and smell, more energy, less baseline anxiety, lower heart rate). The night of day 3 I was hit with severe depressive symptoms, worse than I've felt in a very long time. I cracked a smoked and have been smoking at my usual rate since. 

Anyone have tips for getting through those times? My thoughts in that moment weren't the "woe is me, I'll never be happy without cigarettes", they were around career and relationships- big existential stuff. Still, I slept like a log once I got my nic fix. 

I want free of this, but I fear the hold is deeper than I can push through.

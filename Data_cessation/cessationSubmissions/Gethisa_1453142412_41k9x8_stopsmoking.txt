I'm 18yo and I feel like I'm becoming addicted

Hi,

I'm a 18 years old boy and I started smoking 4 months ago, at a party. It ended up being a reflex, lighting one before going to school, one at the end of the day, and two in the evening. It went to 5 cigs a day to 10-15. I'm scared about it as I know it's not good for me and because I was born 4 months before terms, so I don't have well developed lungs (it's better than it used to be, but still). I'm a really lazy boy and I become easily addict to everything (gaming, food, drinking, smoking). I've managed to reduce my gaming time by 3, stopped eating when I didn't need it and I only drink during parties. However, I feel like it's way more difficult with the cigarettes. 
I used to have a girlfriend to support me about everything, tho she dumped me 7 months ago. Anxiety and loneliness, I think, led to this error of me starting smoking. I need help, and somehow advices to get rid of this bad habit that is starting to get serious.

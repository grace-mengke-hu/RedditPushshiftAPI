6 Months Today!

Had my last cigarette at 07:00 on 19th December, 2016.

6 months on, I can't describe how amazing I feel. Whether it's taking a deep lungful of fresh air in the morning, the smell of cut grass, or the taste of just really good home-cooked food...

Wherever you are on your journey, keep going! It's worth it!

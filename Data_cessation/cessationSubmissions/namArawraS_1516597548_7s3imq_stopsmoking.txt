I met with my smoker friends after a month. Gone well.

They offered me a cigarette but i refused by saying "I'm done with it". They were like haha really. And next two hours they smoked like a chimney. Cravings hit me several times but i simply imagined the after effect and starting over again. I quoted some logics from Ellen carr's book gave them reasons to quit but they didn't take it seriously. They're still in trap and gave so called smoker logics. Well it was a time good spent. Here i am on 4th day.

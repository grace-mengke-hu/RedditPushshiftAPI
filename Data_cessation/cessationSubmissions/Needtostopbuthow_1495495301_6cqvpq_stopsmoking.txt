Day 2

Hey , I just need to let myself vent !!! I decided to stop smoking because someone I was with didn't like it and I knew it was about time for me to stop. The smell irritates people and I have been in situations which were unpleasant. However , I want to stop smoking for myself . I've gotten all the NRT, but does it really take two months till your completely not interested in smoking . Can someone help me get through the next couple of days !

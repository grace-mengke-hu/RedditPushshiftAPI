Hi guys!

I smoked half a pack a day (10 cigs) for approximately two years and stopped smoking three days ago.

Its not as bad as I thought it would be.

I always tried to convince myself that half a pack is not so bad and therefore I wasn't motivated to stop. Three days I just stopped after reading this subreddit.

Now I need a little bit of motivation, because my brain tries to tell me things like "maybe if I just smoke one a day..."

Greetings!

Edit: thank you all for Your words, i made it and today it is easier again!

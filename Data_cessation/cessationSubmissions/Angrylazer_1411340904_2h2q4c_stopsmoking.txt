Today is the day

I don't really know what to write as this is my first time posting on Reddit. I've been subscribed for a couple of weeks and I've really enjoyed reading the stories and advice that's been posted. As the title says today is the day I quit smoking for good. I've been smoking since I was 16, I turn 20 in 3 or so weeks. I've tried quitting before and I really have no idea why I keep coming back to it, I guess I just missed it as silly as it sounds. My family have a history of cancer and heart problems (Dad was a heavy smoker and is on a lot of medication, Granddad was also a smoker and passed away when I was 12). I have one cigarette left and I'm halfway through the Allen Carr video, I'm feeling good at the moment, a little nervous when I think about going without smokes. I definitely won't miss the coughing fits I've had in the mornings.

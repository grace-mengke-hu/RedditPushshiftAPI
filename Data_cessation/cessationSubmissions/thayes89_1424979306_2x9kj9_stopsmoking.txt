General timeline question... Coughing crap up and congestion

Hello all, first post in this sub. I quit smoking around 2 years ago (There have been one or two instances in between where I would have one, by one or two I mean just one or two, however) and I'm wondering from your experience what the timeline is on when I can expect to stop feeling so congested. I play hockey, and find myself coughing crap up and my nose always seems to be stuffed up. In terms of endurance, stamina, and breathing - it's all good. Any thoughts?

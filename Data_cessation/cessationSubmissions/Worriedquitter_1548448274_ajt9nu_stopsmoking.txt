Anybody have issues of Lung/Chest Pain while quitting?

Hi there,

Im 28 and Ive smoked for 3 years (maybe a half pack to a pack a day) finally got my courage up to consider quitting. Last week I made sure to dramatically cut down on my smoking before taking the final plunge a couple days ago. Starting last week I get a periodic dull ache in my chest occasionally. Not sure if it is related to all the coughing Im doing, stress at work (I got a lot), or something more worrying. Feels like I have the flu as well. Planning on a doctors appointment in the next couple weeks just want to see if I should go in immediately as its kinda freaking me out.

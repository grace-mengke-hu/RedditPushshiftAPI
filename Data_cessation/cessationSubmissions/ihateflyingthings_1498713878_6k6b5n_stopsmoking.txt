I haven't set a date yet, advice please?

I recently quit drinking after 15 years, 41 days ago to be exact. I really want to quit smoking too but have been warned that taking on both at the same time can set you up for failure. I saw my doctor today and he said the same thing basically. I did get a prescription for Bupropion (Zyban) and nicotine gum. I was waiting until I was sure I'm not struggling with quitting drinking anymore, and I feel ready now. 
For others here that have been in my situation, how long did you wait before quitting smoking after quitting drinking?
Anyone else with knowledge about this care to chime in with any information or advice?

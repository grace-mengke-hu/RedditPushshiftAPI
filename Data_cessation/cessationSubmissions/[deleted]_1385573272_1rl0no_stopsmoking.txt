How long were you smoking before you were addicted?

Ive been smoking for about 8 months now. I havent gotten to the point where i feel a physical need for a smoke. However, i know if i dont stop soon, ill end up regretting it. I smoke about a pack a day currently, and am wondering how long it usually takes before the physical addiction starts to really become apparent. Any and all responses are greatly appreciated. 

edit: thanks for the responses so far. Also, ive been trying to read up on whether or not going from reds to lights helps you quit or not. Does anyone know if it makes any real differences. I originally started with marb reds, and then got converted to newps, but bought a pack of marb lights for the first time today to see if i felt any different.

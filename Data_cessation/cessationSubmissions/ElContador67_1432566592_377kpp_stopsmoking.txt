What's your opinion on e-cigs as quitting aids?

So here's my deal: I used to smoke 1/4-1/2 pack a day, quit cold turkey about a year ago, had a brief, less-severe relapse for recent final exams; just decided to quit again. 

During the smoke-free year between those events, I would prevent relapses by hitting a vapor pen when I was jonesing for nicotine. Now I've transitioned to a light e-cig habit as part of this latest quitting attempt. 

My question is, do you think vaporized nicotine is a viable substitute on the road to quitting completely? Or am I shooting myself in the foot by reminding myself of the nicotine buzz?

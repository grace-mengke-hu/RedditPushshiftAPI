Something a little weird

So I realized I haven't really been coming to this sub. It's just not something I think about as much as I used to, which I think is a good thing!

But lately I've been having...I don't want to call them cravings. With cravings it was like I could feel how it would be to smoke a cigarette. These are much less intense than that. It's like a flash of intensely wanting to smoke and then being over it. I went for about two weeks without even thinking about it (not even once!), even after my chimney of a roommate came back from vacation, then I saw someone on the side of the road smoking and my brain was like, "Yeeeahh, remember walking home and smoking in the raaaainn??" Actually, yes, brain, I do remember that and it sucked. 

I thought this was weird and was wondering if anyone else could relate?

I hope you're all having a great week!

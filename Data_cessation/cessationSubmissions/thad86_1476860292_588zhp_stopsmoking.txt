This time it feels different.

It's only been two days, but I'm just now beginning my third!

I quit once before, about two years and a few months ago, and it lasted some 9 months. Before that, I had tried over and over unsuccessfully. But that time it felt different. I can't really explain it. It was almost an easy, stress free feeling. Almost like it was easy and fun to not be smoking. But that time, I did it for someone else. I did it in order to have someone in my life that I enjoyed and cared about. But when she left, I didn't have a reason not to smoke anymore and quickly fell back into it.

I think it's been two years since I picked it up again. It makes the 9 months seem so insignificant. I guess it is though, because I started back up.

But it's the end of day two now, and the beginning of day three. I've tried every day for the last two years. I've even had a few times where I made it a week or even a week and a half. But this feels different. It feels like it's easy. Feels like it's fun again. It feels real again. It's only the beginning of day three and I already know that it is different this time. It's inexplicable; it's even different than the first time I quit, because I'm not doing it for anyone this time. This time, I'm doing it for me.

So here's to the beginning of day three. And counting.

The journey starts now

Hi. I'm in my mid-twenties and I've been smoking & vaping for about 2 years now, and recent events in my life have made me try and attempt to be healthier. I've tried quitting before, but usually I've relapsed fairly quickly and returned to the same old habit. I know that I haven't been doing it as long as some / most people have, but it doesn't seem to make it any easier to give up. 

I recently picked up a copy of "Allen Carr's Easy Way To Stop Smoking" which has been said to work wonders. I'd say my biggest problem lies within lack of self-control, as soon as I step out of my apartment my thoughts start going towards lighting up a cigarette, and this "mind demon" is the reason why I've always relapsed in the past. 

This time I seriously want to quit this nasty shit, and perhaps actually use all the saved-up money and health to do something I actually enjoy. Any hints and tips for distracting myself from the cravings are welcome :)

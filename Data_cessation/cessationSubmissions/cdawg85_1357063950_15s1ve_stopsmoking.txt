4 Weeks in and the anxiety and insomnia are getting the best of me.

So 4 full weeks in 4 days, but for the last couple of weeks I have noticed serious anxiety, and insomnia. I cannot get to sleep, once I am asleep I will wake up for hours in the middle of the night, and be unbearably tired the next day. Then, if I have a cuppa joe to wake me up, I will experience a full-blown anxiety attack. When I smoked, caffeine did not do this to me. I've been doing everything I have read: exercise (always have) eat healthy snacks (always have). I'm getting to the point where I think I may need anxiety medication. Have any of you suffered from this? I have quit, and will not start again, but I'm freaking out with a racing heart and mind.

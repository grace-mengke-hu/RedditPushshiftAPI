Cue induced cravings......

I feel, the most common undoing of most quitters are the cue induced cravings. The single most important thing, for quitters, is to plan ahead for such cues. The cigarettes which were constant for a particular time or event of the day.....for years.......are the ones which generate the strongest of cues. The one after lunch, the one after dinner, the one after being pissed off by somebody, the one for the loo in the morning, the one with a drink.....those are the real problematic areas.

One must have a plan to counter these smokes. Something.....anything to do to alter the cues. Helps more than anything else in the initial phase of quitting. 

I suggest, creating a log of situations in which one usually smokes/smoked and then preparing a list of alternative activities to engage in......gainfully.....in such situations. 

Even the strongest of cravings don't last for more than a few minutes.....so a wee bit of preparation is in order for those few minutes.....

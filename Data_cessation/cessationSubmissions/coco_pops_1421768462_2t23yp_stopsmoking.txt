List of Health Risks associated with long-term smoking.

Hey all, I've decided to compile a list of health risks associated with the act of smoking to strengthen your quit decisions, willpower and hopefully inspiring lurkers to this subreddit to quit as well. 

I've used a bunch of different resources to compile them so it's probably likely that I haven't even listed them all and this list is already huge! 

What you'll see is that smoking can damage every part of the body, not just your lungs and mouth. Here they are in no particular order:

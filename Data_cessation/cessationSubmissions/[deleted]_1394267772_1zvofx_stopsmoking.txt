Finally feel like I did before smoking

It's really an amazing moment to finally not feel that heavy monkey on your back. I read plenty of anecdotal stories about how it feels to get this far and a year plus into a quit, but only when you get there you understand it.

The way I feel about smoking now is I have no physical or emotional response to it, it's just something that is out there. I can't remember quite remember how it felt to be a 2PAD smoker but I know my quality of life has improved. There was no magic moment where I felt the change, just know I was feeling like I'll always miss cigarettes then suddenly stopped thinking about them less and less.

I even appreciate all the fails as it made me realize there's no point trying it again. Thankfully the desire isn't there. I'm glad my addiction was only 2 years, can't imagine a decade of hardwiring. It's all chemicals and behavior really, the romanticism I had about cigarettes is dead.

Cold Turkey Worked For Me

I started smoking at 15, smoked for 45 years (for the last 30 of those years 30 to 40 cigs a day), only quit one time, cold turkey, a year and a half ago. No vape, patch, gum, nothing. Just will power which I never thought I had. I've conquered smoking one craving at a time. You can do it too. Be the master of your own destiny!ï»¿

Not knocking any other method to quit.  Just sharing my experience of being a total complete devotee to tobacco and just one day saying bye.

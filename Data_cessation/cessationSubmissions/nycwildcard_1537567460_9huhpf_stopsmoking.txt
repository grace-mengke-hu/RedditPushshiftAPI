Today marks 5 weeks!

That’s all, just psyched I made it this far and wanted to post some shameless self promotion. Haven’t breathed this well in years. Everyday cravings are gone completely, and cravings during stress are easier to smash back down. 

Good luck to everyone! It gets so much easier after week 3.

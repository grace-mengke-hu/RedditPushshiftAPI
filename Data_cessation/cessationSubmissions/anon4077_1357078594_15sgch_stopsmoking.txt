Round 2

I am 3 days in my 2nd serious attempt to quit.  Let me just say that today is rough, every thought is a rationalization of why I should have a smoke. 

I have a really hard time letting go of the rage.  Argued with my SO over nothing important and the worst part is I don't think he realized that I was pissed because of the not smoking.  When I said it was my 3rd day without smoking he was surprised that was why I was mad. 

I went for a walk and that helped with the rage a little, but it could not be a very long since its about 25 degrees outside. 

What kind of support do you guys look for in your SO and how do you control the rage?  How long did you have rage after quitting?

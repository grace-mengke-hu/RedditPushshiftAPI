Had a close call, roommate saved the day.

We are moving house at the moment, and I was working hard last night and was stressed out!  I was sitting on the balcony with my roommate and I asked him for a puff.... This would have been my first time even touching a cigarette since February 16th.  He said no and that I had been doing too well.  I owe him one.

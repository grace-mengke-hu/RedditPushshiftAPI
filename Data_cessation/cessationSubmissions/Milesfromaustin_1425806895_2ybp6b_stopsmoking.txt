messed up

so i started smoking at 17.. pack a day until 28.. i quit with patches (still nicotine so i'm not counting it)... then this new years i quit cold turkey... it was good, didn't crave it, except when drinking with my smoker friends... i'd take a drag, didn't go off and buy a pack. shit was manageable .. bought a can of dip... this is march 8th after quitting jan 1st. not looking for any obvious slamming from the non smokers.. just saying i didn't want nicotine in the least and found myself with a jar of tobaccy tonight, slightly drunk.. anyone know how to fight the drunken tobacco use.. i'm trying to figure out if i want to be totally healthy and be miserable or just do the occasional tobacco use and not go insane... if i get colon or lung cancer at 70 yrs old im alright with that.. i'm also ok with terribly long run on sentences.

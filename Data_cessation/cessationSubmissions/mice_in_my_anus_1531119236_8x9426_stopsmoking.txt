Two months and then not.

I was on two months up until last Friday. I knew a slip up was coming, I’d been thinking about cigarettes all week. Resisted and resisted until the conditions were perfect. 

I went to a houseparty got drunk and someone offered it to me. I hadn’t found it hard to say no until then. So I didn’t. I didn’t say no. I put it in my mouth and dipped its tail in fire. 

It felt weird. It didn’t feel like it used to. Was it smaller? I checked the pack: Winfield Blue. An Australian classic. 

I took a few puffs. 

It felt...

...boring. I didn’t get that dopamine hit I was craving. I didn’t flow into pure ecstasy like I thought I would. 


I’m not proud of myself but I’m also not mad either. 

I smoked about half and threw it out, realised I didn’t really even like it that much at all and haven’t thought about smoking since.

I feel like I kinda needed that to get my head back into shape. To remind me that it isn’t even what my head has made it out to be. 

It actually kinda fucking sucks. 

I’m going to stay quit. I don’t see the point in touching a cigarette for a long time.

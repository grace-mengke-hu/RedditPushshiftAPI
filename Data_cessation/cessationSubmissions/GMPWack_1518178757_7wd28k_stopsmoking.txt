Missing my anniversaries

I keep missing my posts for my anniversaries, like my 3 month, my 100 days, my 1,000th cigarette not smoked.....I think it’s because I’m not focused on not smoking.......I’m focused on getting the other aspects of my life in order. I’m doing well at my new job, I’m getting ready for my trip to Peru in mid-March , and I’m trying to get my fiancee into the U.S.  The fact that I’m not smoking and I’m saving money is just a happy side effect! Stay strong fellow quitters! It does get better!

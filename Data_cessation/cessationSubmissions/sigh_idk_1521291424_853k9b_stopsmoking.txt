Nearly went for a smoke

I work as a waitress which is a stressful job as anyone who's been one will tell you. Today I had enough of everything so I walked out early. 

I was so mad I went to a corner store to get a cigarettes. Out of habit! Usually I have a cigarette by default whenever I leave because fuck that place lol 

As I was standing in the queue I decided I wasn't gonna let that horrible job fuck up my non smoking streak so I'm currently waiting on a pizza which I brought instead. 

Still mad but hey at least I'm not smoking :D 

SN: I really hate that job.

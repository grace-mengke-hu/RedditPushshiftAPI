Feel no need

Currently drinking as much as one would want to drink on a Friday night. About to enjoy some live music and just want to express my freedom. Everyone else smells like smoke and to me that is the smell of victory. Always was afraid that drinking would be a trigger but I am feeling strong. This post confirms that I will not smoke tonight! Happy quitting everyone :]

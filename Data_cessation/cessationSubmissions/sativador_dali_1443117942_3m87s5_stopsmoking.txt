Day four no smoking: Discovered this fantastic sub!

Hello /r/stop smokingI'm a 26 year old, father of 2. I've been smoking since I was 11 and it dawned on me a couple of weeks ago that I've been smoking for over half of my life. I needed to change this!I visited a cessation clinic and they gave me some patches. Up until today I was feeling pretty pleased with myself. Then I did some googling. So most of the links said going cold turkey is the only _real_ way to kick the habit, and that taking patches etc just prolongs the inevitable, dreaded 3 day detox. Surely this can't be the case? I can still feel pleased with my progress this far? Or do I rip off the band aid and go cold turkey?Tl;dr Quit smoking 4 days ago, found sub, currently on patches, do I continue?

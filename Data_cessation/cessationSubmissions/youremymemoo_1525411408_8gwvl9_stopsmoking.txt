The Allen Carr video on youtube has been taken down. While I can appreciate the "legality" of copyright I feel like it was such a great tool! We need to help one another!

Like I said I can understand that as a business they don't want everything to be given away for free, but I feel like have access to that video helped so many of us! Any leads on other sources? Feel free to PM me if you know another source for sharing, and maybe we can find a work around? What do we think?

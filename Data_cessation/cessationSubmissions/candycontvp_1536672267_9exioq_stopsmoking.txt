When does it get easier?

I've been smoking pack-a-day, for 16 years. I had to quit because I was diagnose with chronic bronquitis, I'm only 33 years old, so such a diagnosis also came as a shock to the doctor. 

I haven't smoke in 35 hours. I'm wearing a 21mg patch of 24H release. I had horrible lucid dreams, and kept waking uo during the night wanting tosmoke. 

I've failed so many times at quitting that I don't know what would make this any different, execpt that before I didnt have chronic bronquitis. 

Help!!! I don't know how to make it through today. I'm just craving a cigarette all the fucking time. The craves don't go after 5 minutes like many sources claim, the linger on for the entire day.

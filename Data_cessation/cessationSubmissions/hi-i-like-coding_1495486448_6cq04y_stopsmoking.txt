Alright, this is it. Can I go a whole week without smoking?

I just flushed my pack, and I'm setting a goal for myself. One whole week without cigarettes. Can I do it? I think so.

You guys have been so incredibly supportive it just, really motivates me to quit this stupid crap.

I want this more than anything, I want to quit, I must quit!

I'll be checking in. Hopefully with your support, I can do this! :)

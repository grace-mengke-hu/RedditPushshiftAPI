Wheezing? I'm worried.

Hey everyone. For the last 2 years I've been smoking weed, but 6 months of that time was spent smoking by mixing weed and tobacco in a bong. I smoked pretty heavily and a few nights ago I noticed that I wheeze when I take deep breaths while lying down. I have no other breathing problems, but the wheezing scares me a lot. I havent smoked for 5 days and it has become much less noticable though. I guess this post is just to ask if anyone else has experienced anything similar? Asthma runs in my family, I have a cat allergy and my new roommate has a cat, I have eczema, and I was a smoker. I feel like it could just be a mild asthma symptom as the internet has told me these are all things that can trigger asthma, but my anxiety tells me I could have done permanent damage. What do you guys think? Thanks for the help and good luck to all of you who are trying to quit. I know you can do it.

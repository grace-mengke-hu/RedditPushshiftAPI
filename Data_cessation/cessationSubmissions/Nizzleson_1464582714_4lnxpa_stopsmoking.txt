I'm right in the middle of the biggest craving since I quit about 10 days ago.

Hi team.  

I've been a non-smoker for over a week now, and I thought that (this time!) I was on top of it. 

I Quit for the right reasons.  Kids.  Health.  Money (so expensive to smoke in New Zealand!).  I wasn't enjoying cigarettes at the time I quit.  It was a clean, quick cessation.  Got some nicotine lozenges to take the edge off the cravings.  I stopped wanting the lozenges a couple of days ago, so I was off them too.

Then, all of a sudden, out of the blue, this afternoon, I got struck by the ABSOLUTE NEED to smoke.  To go down to the service station and by a pack.  To get one off a co-worker.  To smoke it, then try to hide the smell from my wife, who isn't a sucker or an idiot, would know exactly what I'd done, and not judge me for it at all.

But I didn't cave.  I sucked a lozenge.  And I actively searched Reddit for this sub.  I found it.  Here I am.

It's fading now.  That was a rough hour.

Help me, Reddit :(

I quit smoking on January 1st, 2015. The first few days were tough, but then around the one week mark I started thinking to myself "Hey, you can really and truly do this! Go, you good thing!". This attitude lasted 3 months. I was so proud of myself. I had quit smoking! I was a non-smoker! Yes! I had beaten the monster!

That feeling has totally gone. I unraveled. I had been having a stressful week and bought a 20 pack of smokes. I was only going to have one, just to make the horrible feeling of wanting a smoke go away. 4 days later, I've smoked all 20 of the damn things.


I'm not going to buy another pack. I think I just need encouragement. Has anyone else gone through this? Please, Reddit, I need someone to chat to about this :(

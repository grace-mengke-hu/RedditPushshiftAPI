Has anyone tried this: Munching on Licorice root to stop smoking?

I was looking for Champix in a pharmacy and they told me they were out, instead they sold me licorice root (tiny wooden sticks, they taste kinda minty, they're not for eating just for chewing), although people should be aware of the side effects of [excessive liquorice consumption](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquorice#Toxicity). 
I gave it a go and it does seem to help with the cravings.
Thought some people would find this tip helpful.

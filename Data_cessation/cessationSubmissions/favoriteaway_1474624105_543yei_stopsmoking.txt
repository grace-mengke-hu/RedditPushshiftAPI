Scared out of my wits of cancer; going through the first 24 hours of stopsmoking

I had some sort of argument with a close friend yesterday, it got heated up, was the evening time, and I went for a smoke.

Even before, I have been feeling very shit scared of cancer the past 4-5 days. But nicotine keeps me coming back -- it just does, and my resolve isn't what it used to be. I used to smoke cigs but switched to minted ones, and now I can hardly stand the normal cigs. I even was smoke free for 4 to 5 months in between, but it's been an on and off matter for over 2 years now. I want to quit, but even a single smoke throws me off balance for months!

But these are all bullshit excuses. I don't have to smoke when I get into a fight with someone or because nicotine feels nice. Bullshit.

Yesterday's smoke left me feeling weird in the throat. I'm scared of esophagus cancer. I was already extremely scared of skin cancer. I'm going to quit now. This is it. I can't do this to myself, or the people I know. It's not worth it. I have spent $83 dollars pocket money on 430 cigs. But that's not it. The consequences could be FAR more devastating than the financial "penalty" so far.

Just waiting for the "roughness" or whatever it is to stop. Extremely anxious since last night. :(

One year down! Making every day my bitch!

Oh shit, y'all. It's been a whole year (and some days, I missed the actual anniversary) and I feel fucking great! Since I've quit I've lost close to 50 pounds, become far more active, changed my diet completely and live an all around healthier life. And it all started with putting that mother fucking pack down. Thanks to everyone that helped me along the way and thank you r/stopsmoking just for being here. 

Seriously, if you're thinking about quitting, fucking quit! You have nothing to lose and everything to gain. If you've quit and going through hell, keep on going. And if you've quit successfully and put your addiction behind you, give yourself a pat on the back, a slap on the ass and get some oral action because you fucking deserve it! 

Cigarettes are the biggest pieces of shit on the planet. Put them down, and keep them down. Fuck smoking.

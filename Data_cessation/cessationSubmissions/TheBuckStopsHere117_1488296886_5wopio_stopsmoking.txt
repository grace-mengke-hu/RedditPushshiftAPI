How to get your lungs to stop burning

A little background on the scenario is I starting using a 24 mg patch four weeks ago to the day. I dropped from a pack/pack and a half to two or three a day just to make it not unbearable. After two weeks I stopped using the patch and decided not to use anyNPR. I now smoke one cigarette a day (and only one) about halfway through the day just to get the burn to stop. Any recommendations for when I stop with the band-aid cigarette?

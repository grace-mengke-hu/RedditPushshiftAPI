Just had my last cigarette.

So I've gone and done it. I've poured the last of my pouch (RYO cigarettes) out on the ground. I had my last ever smoke just 5 minutes ago. I hate the taste, the smell, the cravings, everything about them. It's Wednesday the 19th of October, 10:32 am. Today marks the day I finally go about quitting this horrible habit. I've downloaded an app to keep me motivated and show me progress along my journey. I want to breathe again. I want to run and play sports again. I don't want to have a clouded mind every hour of the day.

Today marks the first of many without smoking. Wish me luck.

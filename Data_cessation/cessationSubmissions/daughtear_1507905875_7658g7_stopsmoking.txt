My husband relapsed after 2 and a half months

My husband relapsed on this shitty day after 2.5 months. He had a really bad day and tells me that it keeps him sane, so i should give him a break. 

But i feel like he is never gonna quit again. I am so upset that i cannot stop crying. 

What should i do? What can i do?

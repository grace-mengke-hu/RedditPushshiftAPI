HELP i did it for 1m10d5h but now...

Now i'm thinking that tabacoo was like self medication since i got addicted to it. Why? So, until my fifhteen It was dificult to be with me in a classroom and did a lot of things out of control besides i couldn't do anything wich need concentration and effort during long periods.

Now I AM a 28 y.o i am living in my parents home and I really want to leave as soon as possible. Just have to finish my Master thesis to get a Job in a spacetime of 1-2 months. I know that smoking Will make everything worse but i am kind of sure that smoking i'll stop this blockade :/ 

I can't be even more than half an hour sitting on my desk. It os like a nonstoping craving bothering me and blocking me to study on my thesis. Even If It try to read some text well rated on r/seldescipline it suddenlly happens a craving beacause reading books is still not a habbit for me, It needs concentration and without a cigarret each hour i feel so agitated.

I started with Allen Carr BTW.

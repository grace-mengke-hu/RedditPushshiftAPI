Almost 2 weeks in. Yeah!

So, I no longer get the urges to go out and buy a pack at 2 am in the morning. Breathing feels much better. Still get some degree of cough when I wake up early in the morning. Had a happy hour yesterday, where a bunch of my friends were smoking. Now normally I would cave in a start smoking (drunk me) but I did not yesterday and it feels great!

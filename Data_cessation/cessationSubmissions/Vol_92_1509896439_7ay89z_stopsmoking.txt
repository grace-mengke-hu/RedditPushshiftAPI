Nicotine Patches &amp; Auditory Noises While falling asleep

Hey folks,

I am on day 5 of patches in my attempt to quit tobacco and I have been experiencing some mild side effects, all auditory noises as I drift off to sleep. I take the patch off right as I goto sleep. 

When they do occur, it's only as I fall asleep initially, not when I wake up in the middle of the night and then go back to sleep. 

Other sleep disorders and other disorders have been ruled out and I have read that this can be a common side effect of the patch, especially since nicotine is still absorbed through the skin 2-3 hours after the patch is removed. 

The occurrence is generally infrequent. I actually sleep very well for the most part and feel very well rested the next day, but when they do occur they are a little rattling, but I do understand they are harmless. 

 If I should take the patch off earlier in this evening, that should be fine. Nicotine consumption has generally always affected my sleep -- as this is one of the reasons I am quitting, along with my own personal health. I sleep a lot better now that I am on the patches, likely considering there is much less nicotine circulating. 

Can anyone shed any light on this?

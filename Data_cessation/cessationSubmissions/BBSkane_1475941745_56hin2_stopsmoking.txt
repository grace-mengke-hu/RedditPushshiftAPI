My feeble attempt

I need, but don't want to stop smoking. However unless I am to follow my late father into his health ordeals and eventual passing, I need to stop. 

Been trying to vape, but it cannot replace the taste/feel of a handcrafted cigarette. 

Yesterday I made the decision, spent all day without a ciggie, had lunch, dinner, no bother. As soon as I relaxed for the night to watch TV and IM my friends, cravings had me running to the store to buy a pouch of tobacco. 

How do you do it?

(any advice, discussion welcome)

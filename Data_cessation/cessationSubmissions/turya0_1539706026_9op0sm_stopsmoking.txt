Headache And Laughter

I used to smoke grass with my friend who used to mix tobacco in it. And I didn't used to smoke tobacco as a cigarette or as a habit. There was a time when i decided to stop smoking grass, because of my exams and during that time I had migraine for 3 months on and off, and I used to watch comedy shows sometimes and now i remember that during that time, I didn't used to feel the pain temporarily. I remember because a day before at a party i again smoked grass with nicotine and now i'm having headache again.

AM i just fooling my mind Or IS there anyone else who has the same experience?(Of that Laughter and pain part)

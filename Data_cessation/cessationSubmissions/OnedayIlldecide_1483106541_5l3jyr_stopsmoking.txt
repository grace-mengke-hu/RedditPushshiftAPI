Checking in

Hey everybody! It's been a while since I posted in here. Holidays were tough but I've gotten through them so far. 

How have they been for everybody else?

Every once in a while, I lead a day camp at my work. This week is the first since I quit. I used to mark time in day camps by sneaking away for a smoke break. Now this week has felt like 2 weeks with nothing to break it up. Just needed to tell somebody before I went insane. Today's the last day, so I'll make it through. Besides, I'm too broke to buy a pack HAHA

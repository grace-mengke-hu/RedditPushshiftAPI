Three days down

I've been smoking since September 2012 and I've had enough of never having any money amongst other things. So I quit (for about the 50th time) and I have a few questions.

1. Is cold turkey really a good idea or should I invest in some patches to make sure I can quit for good?

2. Is anyone else experiencing weird pains in their chest/ heart area 

3. What are some good ways to beat a craving? I've been struggling with the physical side of smoking, like actually inhaling something. I miss that ( E-Cigs are just a terrible idea and I won't go there again)

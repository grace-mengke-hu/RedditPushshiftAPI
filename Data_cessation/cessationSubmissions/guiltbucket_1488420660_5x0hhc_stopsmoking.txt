I was on a role but I slipped up :(

I quit smoking 9 days ago and was doing well with no cravings and feeling good about myself. 

Well today I screwed up and smoked not just one but three cigarettes. It's very tempting to just say fuck it and start smoking all over again.

How do you guys deal with setbacks?

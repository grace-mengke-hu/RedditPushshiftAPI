Struggling to give up the last cigarette...

I've been trying to quit for the last week and am doing well, I'm down from 20 a day to 1 but for some reason I'm struggling to give up that 1 a day... I know it's stupid and there's not much point to just smoking 1 but no matter how many times I tell myself I won't have it I still do! I haven't bought any cigarettes for over a week, am smoking one of my husbands each day.  I've tried vaping in the past but found myself just as addicted to that as I was to cigarettes so don't want to go back there... any advice would be appreciated,  thanks

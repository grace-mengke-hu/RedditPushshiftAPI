What can I expect the next few days/weeks to be like?

For reference, I've been smoking for 7 years now, averaging around 10-15 cigarettes a day (unless I'm out drinking, then it's easily over a pack in a night). Over the past few years I've been starting to feel the toll it's taking. The usual suspects - morning cough, shortness of breath, chest pains, crappy sense of taste and smell... I've been telling myself for a while that I need to find a time when it's right to quit, but that time never seems to come. There's always an excuse, whether it's a night out, a stressful day, hanging out with friends who smoke, or whatever I manage to tell myself. I've realised that there will never be a "right time", I need to just fucking stop, and deal with whatever comes next.

So that's the plan. Tonight the cigarettes are going in the bin, and tomorrow I'm waking up a non-smoker. But I feel I need to know what I'm getting into here. How bad is it going to get, and how can I prepare? How long before I start to feel like myself again?

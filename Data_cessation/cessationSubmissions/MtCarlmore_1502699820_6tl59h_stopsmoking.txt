Coming off NRT

Hello all. I'm on day 8 since my last cigarette, I used patches to help break habits and it's worked well for me. Yesterday when I was away from home, my patch fell off without me noticing. That was around 4.30pm so I went without a patch for the rest of the day. Today, I figured I should try to go without. 

I guess I'm wondering if anyone has any anecdotal info about quitting this way around. Will I find today horrible, compared to the willpower that I spent on top of the nic patch on day 1? Do I have anything worth being anxious about? 

EDIT: I feel horrendous. Any advice would be gratefully welcomed.

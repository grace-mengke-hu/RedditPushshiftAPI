I forgot my quittaversary!

Wow, so I quit nicotine on the 13th of December 2016. I just realized that I didn't even remember the significance of that date when it went past me last week.

This is insane as when I quit I counted every hour and every second. I had awful withdrawals, just awful, but I'm an example that it gets better and soo much easier! I thought that I was one of those people who would have to have a medical intervention to quit but it turns out that quitting cold turkey works just fine. 

If anyone's wondering whether they're strong enough to quit, I can promise that you are. I mostly used snus (although I did smoke too), and I had a pouch in my mouth constantly. I used the strongest snus (Odens) available to me and I was so heavily addicted, both mentally and physically. Still made it through. Glad I did.

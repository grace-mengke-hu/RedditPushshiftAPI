I will never smoke again

Hi!
I need a little support and I need to make myself accountable. I have never posted in this sub and I hope the first time is going to make me excited and will help me to quit.

So, tomorrow is the first day without cigarettes again.
Already requested my badge reset.

Please wish me good luck.
I'll check in after 5 and 20 days. And with a good luck after a year then.

I will never smoke again.

Head cleared/brain fog cleared while quitting? (one week now)

I always hear about people having brain fog during quitting and withdrawal and finding it hard to focus, etc, but i found that my head actually cleared during quitting and while i did feel a bit "off" mood wise due to the nicotine withdrawal, i felt much more mentally focused with very little anxiety! :) Anyone felt the same re anxiety of re clear and focused mind?

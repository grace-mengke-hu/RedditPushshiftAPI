Day 5 complete

I'm glad to say that there were no major cravings in the last 24 hours. I had a couple of cravings when I was close to completing day 4. Those cravings were so bad that I almost wanted to smoke. I survived and now I am happy that I didn't smoke. Within 48 hours, I will have my first smoke free week. However, it's important to stay in the present, not be cocky and be on guard against those damn cravings. Thanks for reading.

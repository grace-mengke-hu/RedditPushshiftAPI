20 year smoker, quit 10 days ago, question about raw honey.

After about 20 years of smoking about half a pack a day (unless partying, then 2-3 packs a night) I finally quit cold turkey about 10 days ago, started doing a lot more cardio than before (even though I was smoking I never quit playing sports) and everything is manageable except for the sand paper my lungs have turned into.     
I see that this is not uncommon as the little hairs start unsticking, but holy mother of crap, it literally feels like sand paper. In spite of smoking I'm in decent shape but now after high intensity exercises that I'm more than used to, I cough until it feels like my lungs are bleeding.   
I did my research and found that some people swear by raw honey and how it helped them soothe the lung sand paper so I just wanted to ask if anyone here has had any experience with it.   
And if not honey, is there anything else you guys would recommend?

Edit: Thank you guys, looks like I'll be picking up a bucket of raw honey and tea leaves!

Thinking about trying the patches as a smoking cessation aid, any experiences/thoughts?

I've had meh success with quitting. About 2 years? ago I quit cold turkey for 2 weeks after reading 'The Easy Way', and somehow that time it seemed genuinely easy. But picked them up again with a false sense of security because of how easy it seemed, and haven't been able to go longer than a day cold turkey since then. I typically smoke 1 1/2 packs a day, sometimes 2 if I'm particularly stressed.

I've been checking out "Habitrol" patches and am considering doing the step 1&gt;2&gt;3 6 week "program". Anyone have any luck/experience/advice regarding this consideration?

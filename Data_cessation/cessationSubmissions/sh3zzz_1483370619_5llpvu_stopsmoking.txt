Day 4 and feeling amazing

Just checking in, 10-15 cigs a day for 18 years. Days 1 & 2 were HELL but today I have more energy, food tastes better (less salt needed), my skin looks great and I feel ridiculously happy - almost giddy. No strong cravings since New Year's Eve. I re-read Allen Carr and also watched the Carr video someone posted here yesterday and I think it's really stuck - I have no desire to become a smoker again. Why the hell didn't I do this sooner?! I really hope this feeling lasts.
Keep going guys, there's so much to gain and absolutely nothing to lose.

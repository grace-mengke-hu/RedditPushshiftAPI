Struggling with not liking who I am right now

I'm irritable and deeply sad and feeling isolated from my work friends.  I've lived with depression since I was a teen (i.e. about 25 years), and have done some really hard work to become someone who is generally positive, empathetic, and patient.  I'm determined to be done with smoking for good this time, but I'm finding the cost worrisome :(  Would love to hear from others who have been there.

Day 1

I have always loved  smoking cigarettes. I really wamt to stop though. That being said, the whole "oral fixation" doesn't describe me.  I am a very tactile (hands on) person. Any advice for feeding my hands when I  craving? I really need some help in this regard. I've just started two new jobs in less than two weeks, so... plenty of stressors. A u advice is helpful here...

Going to give up. Need tips.

Hello, I have finally decided to give up smoking after 10 years and was wondering if any of you could give me advice and or stories of your experiences quitting.

Particularly if you could answer any of these questions would be great. 

Was there any method really worked for you? What made you decide to quit? How did you get through the roughest of cravings? How long did it take you to start feeling healthy again? 

Any comments are welcomed. 

Good luck to the rest of you.

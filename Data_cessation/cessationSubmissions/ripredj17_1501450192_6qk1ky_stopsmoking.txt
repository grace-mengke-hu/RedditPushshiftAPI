18 Days+ Since I've Quit Smoking

I've been using an app to quit smoking. It encourages that I share my progress. It sounds silly, but what helps me most is a mantra: "Not one puff. Not now, not ever." I say that to myself every time I even think about a cigarette. Additionally, I have been drinking a ton of water. This helps kill cravings as well as curb my appetite, which is a killer bonus.

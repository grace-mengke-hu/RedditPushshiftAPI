6 days combustion free (until last night)

I’ve smoked off and on for about 18 years now, and the big 30 is coming up in a few months, and I’d like to be inhalant/nic-free for a bit by then. Since my grandmother was a heavy smoker and is still kicking at 87 (she quit around 70), I always told myself, it’s ok, I could be a lifer.

I’m pretty active and was up to a pack a day, but what motivated me most was my average heart rate while working out. Heart attack range for me is 191 bpm, and there were some days where I’d be at 187/189 during a spin class. This past week I went back to vaping, and my active average heart rate has dropped to 155-168 bpm max. My resting rate is already 55-65, so it feels good to know the active rate is starting to feel the same.

I had quit all inhalants for a year after vaping for about 6 months, 5 years ago, but I wasn’t drinking at the time. I miss that feeling, and the difference this time is I have to drink and not smoke, and it’s like REAL hard...I broke and had a puff last night (friend literally held it to my lips and told me how horrible it was during the whole 10 secs), and it was as gross as I expected it to be, but dammit, I loved cigarettes and I’m happy to know it’s already just not the same. I even found a pack of old cigs today that I contemplated...then I smelled them, got nauseous and threw them away.

Ultimate goal is to be vape free by the end of the month, especially after finding this sub, and reading your stories makes it all feel so much more attainable.

I have to put this in writing, so thanks for reading and posting and just keeping up the good work in general!

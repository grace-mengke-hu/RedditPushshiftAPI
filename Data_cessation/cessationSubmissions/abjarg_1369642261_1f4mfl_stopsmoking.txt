8 days, thoughts on "easy way" and questions

Hey guys so I've been completely smoke-free for 8 days now which means if I don't count my relapse a week ago (smoked 2 cigarettes), I've been off for 17 days :) 

I started to read the easy way to quit smoking because I randomly found it in my mother's storage area when I was helping her clean it out (she is a smoker). It's an Icelandic translation from 1997 so maybe that's the problem but I'm not really liking it as much as I thought I would be a few chapters in. I will finish reading it though. 

I have some questions about appetite and cravings 
1) Those of you who are far in and have experienced a greater appetite, when did this start happening? 
2) To all of you, how do you combat the occasional cravings? (They are SO rare now for me but I'd still like to hear how you do it) 
3) To anybody who has experienced a greater appetite after quitting, what do you do so you don't get fat? Haha. My mom quit for over a year a few years back and gained like 10 kilos. I don't want that happening!!!!

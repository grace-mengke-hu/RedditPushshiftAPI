Ready to make the change.

I got out of the hospital with pneumonia and after 3 days I was able to smoke again. Realized it was disgusting after two weeks of not smoking. Now that my lungs healed back up I have intense urges to smoke, so I bought camel snus to kill cravings. But I want to live longer with my wife who also smokes. Thanks for the support guys. Day 1 let's do it.

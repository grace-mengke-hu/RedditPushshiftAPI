3 months and feeling stupid

3 months in and feeling stupid. I've been using exercise to treat cravings. Going from little exercise to exercise nearly everyday for the last 3 months has me feeling good. Combine that exercise with no smoking and I'm feeling too good. I'm cocky, quick, ready to fucking fight whatever I can just because I can. I'm emotional. I'm an asshole. People at work are starting to ask questions. Fuck people at work, what do they even know? I need to find a better way to deal with this emptiness, or anger, or whatever it is... 

Smoking sedated me and made me put off dealing with the asshole inside of me. At least I'm not smoking so I got that going for me. 

Can anyone relate?

22 years old and smoking is making me sick.

My immature red blood cell markers, reticulocytes, are almost double a healthy persons. My Hemoglobin is high, I'm short of breath, I'm exhausted. No wonder, smoking has given me molasses for blood.

Time to stop. I stopped drinking using reddit, time to conquer cigs before they take me out.

Day 1 is tomorrow. No vaping, no smoking, nothing. Time to kill the nicotine monster. Laugh in his face.

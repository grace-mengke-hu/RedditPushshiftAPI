Day 110 without smoking

I have taken off the 7mg patches and stopped chewing the nicotine gum. I'm officially nicotine free as of 2pm eastern time yesterday its a little after 9am and im feeling pretty stressed and anxious but Im not going back to nicotine. I am done with nicotine. Might go for a long walk today and take a hot bath to take my mind off things. 

The nicotine withdrawal comes in waves. At first I dont feel anything then I suddenly feel like I am about to have a panic attack. It really sucks. Hoping I make it through the day without going back  to nicotine gum. If I make it through the day without the nicotine gum I think I quit for good. Cheers

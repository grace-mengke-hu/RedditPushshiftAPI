2 weeks since I had my last cig. This is the longest I have ever gone in my attempt to quit, I hope this'll finally be it!

So...ya.

Usually I've gone a week and just caved due to whatever event is happening...using cigs as a way to escape stress and stuff.

But I honestly feel so much better about myself than I used to. I'm not constantly worrying about my health and I've found myself being a lot more active than I ever used to be.

Also. Chocolate. Omigosh. AND TEA AND OMG. Just everything man. 

Tonight I'll be drinking with a few friends. This'll be a challenge as I haven't touched a drink in fear of relapsing due to stupid drunken based choices. So, wish me luck please reddit! :D

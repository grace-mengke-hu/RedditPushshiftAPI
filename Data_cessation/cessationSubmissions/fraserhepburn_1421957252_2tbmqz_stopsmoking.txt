18 days down - almost three weeks yay!

coming up on three weeks now - things are going well. starting to think about it a bit less. still not getting much in the way of a decent sleep but hoping that'll change soon. 
have found the app to be very useful. and the jar of money is getting larger so that seems to be keeping me motivated. 
i think the biggest issue arises at work as most of the people at work smoke.In saying that it smells bad so i tend to move away from it.
 I dont even think about smoking when i wake up now which is good. i used to be on my 3rd or 4th by the time i got to work.
fingers crossed i may have cracked it this time. big test will be a night out but not got any of those planned for a while so should be sweet.

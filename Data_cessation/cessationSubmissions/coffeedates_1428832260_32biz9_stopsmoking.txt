First craving.

I've been trying to post as often as I can, but quitting has been too easy. This is my sixth time quitting. Cold turkey, Carr method.

If you read some of my older posts you'll see that I've been having a super easy time quitting. I had cravings for the nicotine withdrawal period and after day four they stopped completely. I've made myself completely done with cigarettes over the past two years. I just keep trying and every attempt gets easier. After a while you know what to expect when quitting.

Im going on to day 19. I had my first real craving last night and I think it was triggered by friends, alcohol and the weather. My friends and roommates are super supportive of my quit. They'd probably smack a dart out of my mouth if they saw me trying to smoke. They smoke themselves but I know they want out too, so they want to see me succeed. Best thing I can do is show them that it's easy.

I try to join them outside a lot of the time when they smoke. Just for the fresh air and the weather. Being grossly intoxicated and doing this is a little tough. At points my brain was making me feel like I was being 'left out', but I know that isn't true. 

I never once tried to act on relapsing. It just was on my mind for hours, which actually scared me a little.

It's past me now. I know smoking would do zero for me and I'd end up feeling gross and tired all the time.

Here's to quitting forever.

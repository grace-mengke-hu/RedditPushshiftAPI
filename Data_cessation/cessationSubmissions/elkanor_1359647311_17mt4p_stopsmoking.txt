Tomorrow = One Year Later

Things I had either never done without a cigarette or hadn't done without a cigarette for a decade, until the last year:

* Been in a relationship
* Had an alcoholic drink
* Been through a break-up (not easy!)
* Gone to the gym consistently (without lighting up before and after)
* Survived holidays with my family
* Enjoyed the post-sex glow

The last year has not always been easy. The break-up made me have cravings. I still sometimes have dreams that I accidentally start smoking again and then, in the dream, I remember I quit. 

But last night, a friend who has been away for a while and just moved back said to me "I know you don't smoke but..." and I just sat there going "YUP!! I DON'T SMOKE!! YAY!!"

For the resolutioners and folks who may be having trouble, I swear to God this is possible. I smoked a pack a day for at least five years. I would advise you not to drink for the first month you are quitting and to not be afraid of nicotine replacement therapy. I used lozenges. 

I am totally eating cake or something tonight :D

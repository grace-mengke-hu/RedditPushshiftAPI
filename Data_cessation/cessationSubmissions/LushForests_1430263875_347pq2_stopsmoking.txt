I guess i'll try this.

I have been smoking for around seven years. Lately I have been having pain in my lungs and sometimes I think taste blood. I figure it would be a good idea if I quit. Mainly for the health benefits... I would hate to get cancer if I already haven't. 

I have four cigarettes left in in my pack and I am seriously contemplating if I should even smoke them. I think I will, that should get me to the end of today then tomorrow will be day one. 

I have quit before (cold turkey) but I only made it two weeks, then I went out drinking and bought a cigar. It's going to be a rough while if I go through with this. I'm stressed at the moment but I figure if I can get through it in a rough time I can get through it any time.  

I'm going to miss the social aspect of it, or the fact it gives me something to do when there is nothing to do. Things i'm not going to miss are the taste/breath, smell on clothes and body.

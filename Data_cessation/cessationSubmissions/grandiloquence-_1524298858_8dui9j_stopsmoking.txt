Hard day at work

I had a high stress day today, and an altercation with a coworker. I work in a stressful, fast paced industry. One where a lot of people smoke. And I was already worried about today, as it was only day three for me.

But even with how crazy it was, it somehow didn't seem as stressful as normal. And though I did catch myself wishing for a cigarette more than once, I didn't smoke. I didn't even have to talk myself out of smoking, because it simply felt natural not to smoke. I am a non smoker!

Day 3/Forever complete.

Big test: The first concert

11 days strong thus far. But tonight. Oh man tonight will be the first time at a show since the quit. You know the routine. Set ends, go for a smoke, get another beer. Repeat throughout. Will be the first smoke I truly miss. It's great socializing between sets and nerding out over what you just saw. Ahh well, here we go! Not too nervous I'll cave and go for a smoke, but just venting. Seeing Joyce Manor if your curious!

16 days under my belt, working on 17th - some reflections

Hello, everyone,

The title says it all, really, it has been pretty much smooth sailing, the fact that is still of some fascination to me. 

After being a committed, unapologetic, rebellious smoker for 32 years - 32 years! - the farthest thought from my mind has been that I might escape this habit without any major trouble, yet this is precisely what has been happening. Had I read this post of mine say 2 years ago, I´d be super annoyed and hopeful in equal measure, because until you prepare your right frame of mind and lay down the plan, it is much more challenging. This is why I´m writing this, to hopefully encourage someone like my old smoker self, and if I annoy someone in the process, well... Cost of doing business, heh.

In my experience, smoking cessation  has been mythologized so much that many people who would otherwise simply and easily be quitting, don´t even dare try. Certainly it is an addiction that has its claws into us, and as such must be dealt with cleverly and seriously - but the overwhelmingly large part of that addiction is your own mental game. That part is both possible to learn and under your own control. Step one is readiness; while there are schools of thought that say you can´t do anything about your addiction until this desire, this readiness, falls into your lap, at some time, from somewhere... You can certainly educate yourself ready. 

The key for me has been dismantling, one by one, all the arguments I had that were arguing in favor of smoking ADDING VALUE to my life. One by one, I examined the argument, then searched for the counterargument. Believe me when I tell you, that didn´t take long, and the reason why is that smoking is objectively a terrible thing to be doing compared to err...not smoking. It´s really really complicated until a certain point, at which it becomes very clear and simple - and then it can never seem that complicated again.

I want to quit so bad, but I always fail. Advice?

I'm starting my 4th attempt at quitting, and I want it to be the time I finally do it. I'm constantly around smokers and social smoking rings(unavoidable with my work/family/friends) so any coping methods would be amazing. I'm tired of smelling like smoke and being chained to an addiction I'm aware does nothing for me. I've just finished Allen Carrs Easy Way To Quit Smoking, and I'm feeling a tad bit more confident. I have 19 cigarettes in my pack, and I'd like to keep those around to overcome temptation(I'm very bad about it). Help me save money and my life! Emphasima runs in my family, so the sooner I rid myself of tobacco the better.

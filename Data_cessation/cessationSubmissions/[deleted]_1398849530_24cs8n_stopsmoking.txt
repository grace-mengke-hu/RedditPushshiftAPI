I never thought this subreddit is a place I'd be posting in

I'm an athletic, 23 year old guy. Lift weights and run around 20 miles a week. About 5 months ago I was going through a very tough period of time, to the point where no amount of exercise made me feel better. My grandfather has smoked for over 50 years, and my dad for over 25 years. They're still in good health, but their smoking habits revolted me, so I was convinced that I'd never follow in their footsteps. But I caved in because I saw no other way to alleviate the stress, and smoked at least half a pack a day. I had no idea just how addictive (and relaxing) it could be.

It was an ugly routine. I'd continue to run 3x/week, lift 3x/week, and smoke 1/2 pack each day. Miraculously my fitness continued to improve, and despite smoking for the past 5 months I've never been a faster runner than right *now*.

I'm paranoid and blow shit out of proportion a lot, so I started reading countless articles and stories about lung cancer, heart disease, all that stuff. I really psyched myself out. Got scared shitless. I don't want to end up dying early from some disease. I couldn't put my family through that, and there are still so many things I want to achieve in life.

I read that it takes many years of heavy smoking to develop a cancer, but there are cases of young folks catching it too. So maybe I'm being too paranoid, but I hope the past 5 months haven't done severe enough damage. I want to quit for good and never worry about this sort of thing again.

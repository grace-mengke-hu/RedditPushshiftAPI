Red 5 Checking In

Perusing the sub I didn't see enough old timers so I'm checking in to remind all the awesome new quitters, it can be done.

I had my first field trip with my daughter last week and after it was all done I realized that it may not have happened if I was still smoking. I used to dread long stretches (2 hours or more for me) without being able to smoke. It's really sad to think about, but I'd have definitely considered not going because of that. I just about want to cry, actually, just thinking about the ridiculous effect smoking had on my life.

Man, even if I had gone, it would have been torturous to go 5 hours without smoking while chasing 6-year-olds around.

Instead, I shared a once in a lifetime experience with my daughter and her friends. I saw a side of her that I don't normally and I got a million awesome photos to help remember it forever. I shared photos with moms and dads which enabled them to be a part of it too. I never knew how far my habit could reach.

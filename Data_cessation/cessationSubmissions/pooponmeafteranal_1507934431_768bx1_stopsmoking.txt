Finished my last cigarette an hour ago

I stopped for a cup of coffee because it's about to be a long ish night. Walking out of the coffee shop, I patted myself down to make sure I had everything. Keys - check. Phone - check. Wallet - check. Smokes - pocket empty. A split second of panic ensued. Then I remembered that I'm a non-smoker now.

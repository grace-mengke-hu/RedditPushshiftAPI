Day 1 - Again

A little over two years ago I quit, and I stayed clean for a little over a year. The story of relapsing is familiar for some, first with other people's cigarettes, then with the occasional pack, and now I'm back in the rhythm of smoking 3 or 4 packs a week.

The experience is familiar. I no longer enjoy my cigarettes. I feel worse physically after each smoke, the only relief is the feeling of relieved tension. But I want to get rid of the tension for good. Again.

I'm quitting tonight. I smoked my last cigarette a few hours ago. It's all in the trash now. I'm starting a tough week. I just need to make that promise known to others. I know that in a few days I will be fighting myself.

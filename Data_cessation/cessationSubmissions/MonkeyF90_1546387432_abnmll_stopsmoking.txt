Incomer from r/ADHD. Stopped vaping today.

Hi. Smoked on and off since  11. Moved to vaping this time last year to stop bumming cigs off people when drinking. 

Getting less impulsive due to Concerta. Decided stop vaping.

The amazing supportive people at r/ADHD said this subreddit was really cool so Iâ€™ve joined.

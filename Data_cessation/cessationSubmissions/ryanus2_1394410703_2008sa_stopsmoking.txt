First time drinking without a smoke

I'm a little over seven days without smoking. This is the first time I've had a drink without smoking, and it's also the first time being around people who are smoking. This is a terrible combination, and no one knows what I'm going through. I'm not going to smoke, I just needed to vent. I feel like I need to hit a punching bag or something to get through this hour long craving. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Sorting my life out big time- Going cold turkey after 17 years ...

So after a pretty shitty break up I am going to sort my life out and give up these overpriced death sticks for good.
I smoke between 20-30 a day and its time for this to stop. 
I am constantly making excuses not to quit and tricking myself into thinking I can do it next week. I have been looking at this group for a few days now and half expected a bunch of dicks trying to make people relapse and stuff , how wrong I was.
I am amazed at all the support you give each other and hope to be apart of that.
So as of tomorrow the 29th of august I am gonna give up everything in my life that's bad for me (except beer) and hopefully make myself into a more healthier and attractive and confident person.
Wish me luck here goes nothing :)

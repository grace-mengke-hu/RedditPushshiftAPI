Something to clear out the lungs / throat?

I'm quit for a week now and have been disappointed by the lack of mucus I'm coughing up. During previous quit attempts I usually spent the first 3-5 days coughing a ton and getting a lot of mucus out of my system. This time I'm not experiencing that but I can feel a lot of mucus building up in my system.

Is there something I can take to encourage my body to reject the mucus?

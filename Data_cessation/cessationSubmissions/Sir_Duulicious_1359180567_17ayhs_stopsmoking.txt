Damnit... damnit... DAMNIT! Fuck this addiction...

So for the past five days I've done well at quitting... Didn't smoke a cig, didn't crave a cig, it was as perfect as quitting gets.

Well then my girlfriend came back in town from college which is great... but she had what was left of my pack. Well we get invite to a hookah bar and being stupid I thought I was ready...

As soon as that nicotine from the hookah passed my lips I told my girlfriend to hand me the cigs... She smokes with me but isn't "addicted" per say. So me and my buddy and her, both of who both rarely light up. 

Well my buddies girl lights up so he puts the smoke out in the ash tray, well I finish mine and light his back up. Well as soon as I got done with his I felt the instant ting of regret! I promptly snapped every cig I had left in mine and my girlfriend's possession. 

Well fuck... the regret... feels shitty, hopefully I'll look back on how I feel now next time I think about smoking.

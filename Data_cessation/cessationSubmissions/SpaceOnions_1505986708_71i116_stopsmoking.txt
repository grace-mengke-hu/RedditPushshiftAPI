I think I'm ready

Let me start off by offering some background information of myself:
Currently, I am 23 years old and have been smoking since I was 14. I am up to almost a pack a day right now. 
Lately, I found a new love and she does not smoke. Although she is okay with me smoking, it has opened my eyes. I would never stop for any one else, yet I feel this might be the extra encouragement I have been looking for. I have been thinking about quitting for about half a year now but I never made the final step. Today I have decided that I will finish this pack (11 cigarettes left) and will (hopefully) never buy a new one.
One issue that I think may cause problems is that my roommate will still be smoking (in the house). I can go to my room to escape the smoke but I will still inhale toxins (&amp; nicotine) every now and then. How should I deal with this?

I am looking for some kind words since I am scared and anxious about this step. Also, any advice would be welcomed open-heartedly.

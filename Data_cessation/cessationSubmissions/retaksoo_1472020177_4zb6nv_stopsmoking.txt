hi guys, new to this sub

so technically this is day 2 for me...my buddy gave me a serious vape he had yesterday. i only smoked 4 cigs throughout the day. this is now day 2 for me...i don't have any smokes left and am reliant on the vape alone. i'm not sure what else to include here. i'm looking for any type of support/insight about it all.
thank you!

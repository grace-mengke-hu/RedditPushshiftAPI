72 hours!

For the first time in about 6 years I've hit 72 hours without smoking and so far I feel great.

I have more energy and motivation, and holy shit my appetite has been insane the past two days I have not been able to get full no matter how much I eat.

I've had a toothpick in my mouth all the time and that has helped with cravings so far

Big thanks to everyone on here its been a huge help seeing how supportive everyone on here is!

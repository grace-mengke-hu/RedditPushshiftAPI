I realized when I crave something else, my brain is still trying to trick me into thinking it's a cigarette.

I have that "craving" feeling right now. It's day 63 and I get these every now and then but I STILL revert back to thinking it's nicotine. I honestly don't know what it could be. I've had plenty of caffeine today, can't be that. Am I an alcoholic too? Hahaha, I don't think so. At least not the type to be craving a drink in the middle of the day. I can't put my finger on it. It's like a phantom craving. Anyone else get these? Can anyone explain what's going on?

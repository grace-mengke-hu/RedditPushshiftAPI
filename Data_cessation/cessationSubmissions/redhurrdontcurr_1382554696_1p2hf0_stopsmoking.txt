30 hours without a cigarette... I want to cry right now

I smoked my last cigarette just before going into work at 8:00 yesterday morning, and I'm currently in the throes of one of the most intense cravings of my life. Luckily, I'm sitting at my desk at work right now and I have no cigarettes in my car, so I couldn't give in at the moment even if I wanted to. I didn't know it would be this hard. It is so frustrating, knowing that I picked up a habit that has such a hold on me that I want to break down in tears right now because I can't indulge in it.

I can't give in. I'm tired of stinking and coughing. I'm tired of trying to kill the smell so nobody at my office knows I smoke, even though deep down I know they can smell it. I'm tired of feeling unhealthy. I'm tired of having a disgusting habit that people judge me for. I'm tired of secretly knowing they're right for judging me.

How do I get through these intense cravings? How do you keep going? I'm miserable right now. How did you guys resist the urge to break down? How do you endure the misery when you know what the cure is and how to get it?

I know I can fight it off. I just needed to vent. I knew it would be hard, but I didn't know it would be as intense as it has been.

**EDIT:** Just wanted to say thank you to everybody for the advice and encouragement. I am now at 49.5 hours and counting. There were ultimately some tears yesterday, and I may or may not have snapped at my boyfriend for leaving a coke can on the end table, but I made it to today! **I CAN DO THIS!!!**

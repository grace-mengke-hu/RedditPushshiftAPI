Over months and holding strong

Proud to say that yesterday I resisted buying a pack. I’m home visiting my parents for the holidays and I walked by my old favorite shop where I used to buy a particular brand of cigarettes. For a moment I considered buying them “for old time’s sake” or “just for the holidays” but then I thought a little longer and I made the decision not to. Really proud of myself for resisting because that store has broken quit streaks before. 

Do other folks have that issue with the “just this one time” or “temporary” picking back up of smoking that turns into longer? I’m getting better at ignoring that mentality but it’s probably one of my biggest weaknesses.

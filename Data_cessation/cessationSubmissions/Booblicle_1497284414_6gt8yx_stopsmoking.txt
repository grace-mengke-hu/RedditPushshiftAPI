Nostalgia spiral.

Today has been a overwelming spiral of nostalgia of my youth of before I ever picked up cigarettes.  Usually it's from smelling something, but today it was emotions, and more specifically cold weather. And they were all wonderfull comforting feelings. And of belonging. What triggered it was an unusual cold front, ( despite it being 60 degrees ) mixed with not really experiencing an actual winter in years.

I just wanted to share this with you to give you guys hope. There is light on this side of the tunnel and we'll be waiting for you.

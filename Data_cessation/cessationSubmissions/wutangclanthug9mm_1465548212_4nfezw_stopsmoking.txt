Doing this without a plan is stupid. Right?

At the moment, it's day five.  In two days, it'll be day seven.  All I can think about is this familiar fall back on going outside and setting my lungs on fire.  It's bizarre how many things in my life I associate with smoking.  Meal? Smoke.  Drink? Smoke.  Downtime? Smoke.

This habit has been ruining my body for 17 years and it's starting to show.  I'm trying not to flinch in the face of my health and future, but it's pretty fucking hard.

Anyway, I need a plan, right?  Doing this willy nilly seems silly.  What are the tricks of the unprepared?  How do I harness the momentum of a 5 day head start?

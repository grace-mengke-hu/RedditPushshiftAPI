I can't seem to commit to quitting

I am a current medical student and know how bad smoking is for me. For some reason whenever I decide to quit I change my mind and just start smoking again. It's probably due to the stress of medical school. Where I live it's only $2 a pack so the price of cigarettes is not an issue. I always just convince myself I am young and I can quit later. I've been smoking for about 5 years now. Does anyone have any advice on how to stay motivated and not fall back into thinking that I don't need to quit yet?

10 Days

Quit smoking on 3/31 and couldn't feel better. I'd smoked half a pack a day for 5 years and after lurking on this sub for a few weeks, I told myself it was the day, bought a vape, and smoked my last cigarette. It's a liberating feeling. I vape maybe once a day and only carry the vape around in case I get a craving. I hope to quit vaping by the end of the month. 

I forgot what I looked and felt like before I became a slave to smoking. My skin color is now a healthy pink-ish, not a grayish-green. I no longer have bags under my eyes, my clothes no longer reek of smoke, and I can taste and smell so much more. I no longer leave a party to go smoke outside in isolation or get irritated because I hadn't had a cigarette in over 2 hours. I had dreams where I smoked cigarettes for the first two days since quitting but they went away. I feel different, good different, no longer beating myself up over being an addict and destroying my health. 

I feel free and in control of my choices and I see it translating to other areas of my life. I've established goals for my future and I am finally finding courage to get back to exercising. If I knew how much smoking had affected me mentally and how much it contributed to my depression, I would have quit a long time ago. 


If you are reading this and debating whether you should quit smoking - do it and stick with it. Be prepared for withdrawal symptoms but also remember to look forward to the life where you, not cigarettes, are in control. It's a liberating feeling.

Decided to finally quit smoking.

After 13 long years as a smoker I have decided to quit for good. This isn't new and is apart of me trying quitting for years Essentially within the last two years i have quit for about a 6 month stretch and dozens of times for weeks with cold turkey. Anyways I finally had enough. I picked up a pack tonight and it was stale as fuck...which is more than enough to set me on a quitting spree. Anyways all wish me luck

Quitting today.

I was going to quit New Years but I have a driving test on the 4th of January and didn’t know how stopping smoking would affect me 

So I just turned 24, I started smoking maybe about 18 years old? Probably for about 2 years and then vaped 70% and smoked the rest

Then I had my tonsils out and stopped all together for maybe 2 years but I would like to smoke when I drank alcohol, and then it would be I would be stressed out about something so smoke in the evening, then it turned into a couple a night, then 6pm, then 4pm then 2pm and it’s been like that for about 2 months but I’m stopping today. I smoked my last one last night and it’s 12pm and I don’t feel the need to smoke at all, but I know the cravings will come soon 

So with a 2 month habit, I guess I’ll have it easier than most smokers trying to quit, but just how easier? I was forced not to smoke before when I had my tonsils out and didn’t crave them
At all because of the pain I was in 

Any tips for cold turkey? Any info regarding a short smoking habit?

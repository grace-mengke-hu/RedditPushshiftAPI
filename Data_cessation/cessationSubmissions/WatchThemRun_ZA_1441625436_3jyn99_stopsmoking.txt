Insight from an old ex-smoker

So, was chatting to my father in law yesterday. He stopped smoking 25 yrs ago, and made an interesting comment. He said that stopping is simple, not easy, but simple. Just don't smoke again. Also, and more worrying, is that he still gets a craving for a smoke after all that time. Maybe once a year, but still. Guess are brains are reprogrammed now, and it's something we gotta live with. 

Keep strong everyone.

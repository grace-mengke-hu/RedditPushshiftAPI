Any tips to successfully quitting?

I'm new to this thread but I plan on quitting smoking once I'm done with my current packet. I have around 20 smokes left so I will be quitting in 2 days time. 

I have tried to quit before and I just don't have the self control to stop for longer than 12-24 hours. This time, I'm truly sick of smoking, the coughing, the smell etc. thinking about quitting makes me anxious and nervous so I have to try to deal with that aswell.

Do you have any tips for me to get through those first few days of quitting? How to get through the cravings? How to not stuff my face with food instead of smoking? What was it that helped you keep going with not caving into having a smoke? I'm a stay at home mum so most of the time I smoke out of boredom or to get 5 minutes to myself without the kids. 

I have downloaded an app which I plan to use too. 

Any help is much appreciated! Thanks!

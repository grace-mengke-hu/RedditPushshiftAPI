crosspost from xxfitness - the patch and exercise

you're supposed to take it off 2 hours before working out. hello unhelpful? is that for real? do people really do this? 

i'm doing patch + lozenges - lozenges alone will not get me through 2 hrs. 

for *when* to use the patch around exercise, have read: put the new patch on after your workout. this is evenings for me, that means i'm getting more nicotine at night when i don't need it, also screws up my shower routine. 

i am def using the patch, it was so helpful to me last time. (only reason i restarted was there was a HUGEEEEEE family argument one christmas, i was doing well before that even with a ton of other stress.) 

so i want to use the patch - how do i use it around workouts? i have been just using 2 patches. 

or maybe if i put medical tape over it? nice sticky mess to deal with there, boo

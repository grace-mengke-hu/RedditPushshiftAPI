Having trouble quitting

TL;DR: I'd like to quit and have the benefits of being a non smoker, but I really *dont want* to quit.  Obviously, major brick wall...  Help?

---------------------------------------------------------------------


So I have tried a couple of times to quit now and I keep running into the same brick wall...  I really don't want to...

For instance, I want to be able to wake up in the morning without the first breath of air feeling like I'm inhaling a brick.  I want to be able to drive around, and be with friends, without needing to make sure I have a pack of cigarettes.  But... I REALLY enjoy smoking.  It's not any of the "stress relief" crap, as I know that's not how it works,  I just really enjoy the activity.

Basically, I just can't seem to get the initial motivation to quit.  I keep saying "Alright, enough is enough, this is my last pack".  Then I run out half way through the next day, and really don't want to finish the day without a smoke when I've already been smoking that day... On the flip side I don't want to quit with half a pack because I smoke REALLY expensive cigarettes and I can't bare to waste things in life...

I know it's just a bunch of excuses, but this is proving to be a MAJOR roadblock.  Did anybody else run into this issue?  I had come so close to quitting last year using lobelia (say what you will about safety, the side effects are all the exact same as tobacco and it worked wonders for me until I ran out and ran into the situation following), but the gas station I always went to tossed the pack onto the counter not knowing I quit, and the situation was so familiar I didn't even realize I bought them...  Then a coworker asked me for one, I opened the pack and gave him one...  Went downstairs to chat with him and ended up lighting one up... I'm sure you all know the story from there...

today will be day 11

I've broken some barriers down.. strolling the little one to daycare, I'd have my first one after drop off during the walk home. Later I would take a break every 2 hours from work and go on a walk, then I'd sit in the bar after work for 1 - 3 beers and have one or two for each beer and always another for the walk home.

After dropping off the little one I don't even think about smoking. But here I sit typing this and I'm having a rare craving enough I'm not around smoke or alcohol right now. I know when I'm done typing this the craving will go away.

I have been to the bar three times since, all around smokers and smoke. I can smell it on someone's breath from 8 bar stools down when they walk in from outside. It doesn't bother me. Just another motivation to not be that guy that smells like that.

Looking forward to hit 2 weeks and my badge icon changes. I'm still learning to ignore the habits and barriers.. my next fear is when I travel. I loved nothing more than having a smoke before I go into the airport and especially immediately after I get off the airplane. Or travelling in an exotic place in Europe or South America. But that comes later, for now all I need to focus on is not smoking today.

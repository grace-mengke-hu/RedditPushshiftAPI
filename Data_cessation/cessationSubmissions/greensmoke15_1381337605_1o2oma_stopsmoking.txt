I Feel Sick

So tomorrow will be two weeks, and I have a crazy head cold.  This has happened before when I have quit, but not always.  What is really crazy is that the little minion dancing around my neurons is telling me that if I just smoke I will feel better.  How ridiculous.

Has anyone else felt like this?

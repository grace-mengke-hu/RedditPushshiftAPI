Small victory

Coming up on a week with no smokes. Today I got thrown a little curve ball. I went out to the mailbox, and low and behold, I had received some coupons from my brand of choice. I get these on a semi-regular basis, and I've used them in the past to put off quitting (I'm sure most of you can relate the perpetual state of "quitting eventually"). But not today! Even though one of the coupons was for 1 pack for $1 (seriously?!), I tore them into pieces before the nicotine addict voice in my head started getting too loud. Sort of felt some regret and remorse about passing up an opportunity to smoke again, but that's not the right way to approach these things. I need to view it as a positive decision, regardless of coupons. A smoke is a smoke, no matter how cheap, and I've made a commitment to stop doing  that.

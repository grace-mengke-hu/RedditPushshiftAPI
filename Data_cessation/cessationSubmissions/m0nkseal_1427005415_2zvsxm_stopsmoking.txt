Has anyone tried quitting by gradually reducing their nicotine intake?

I used to smoke Marlboro Reds (Ni 0.8), I switched to Marlboro Gold (Ni 0.5), then switched to Davidoff Blue (Ni 0.3) and I'm currently on Dunhill Blonde Blend (Ni 0.1). This has definitely helped me reduce my cravings and I do not crave for a smoke the first thing after waking up. 

I read a research article stating that the risks associated with lower nicotine cigs are as high as risks associated with the heavy ones. It also states that the Ni dependency of people smoking light cigs is lower for obvious reasons. 

I needed to know if anyone here has successfully quit by tapering down their nicotine intake and then finally cutting it off? If so, how exactly did you go about it?

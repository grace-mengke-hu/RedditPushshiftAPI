Day 11...

Today is day 11. It's Monday and I'm sitting here at work feeling completely unproductive. I just can't get going and I've been here all day. I don't know why I feel this way. I just want to go home and sit in bed. I'm depressed I guess... and I hope it passes. That said, I'm still nicotine free.

2 Months! Oh crap

Hey all,

Just opened up Stop smoking this morning and noticed I have a new icon!

2 months, never thought I could get there. But here I am, I can't even remember the last time I had a craving. It was probably recently but was so slight I didn't even notice.

Some of you may remember I stopped drinking as well. That is currently at 18 days. It has been much more difficult than quitting smoking. I think its because Alcohol is so widely accepted, we even have 2 kegerators in our kitchen at work. I have powered through taking it one day at a time, telling myself, "No matter what happens today, I will not drink"

This sub-reddit has been amazing with its support and I can't even express how much of a help it has been. You guys all rock!

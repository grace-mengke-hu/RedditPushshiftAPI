Day 6....getting easier and harder at the same time

This is my 8th time trying to quit...so I know most of the sneaky little tricks my mind is trying to play on me. Like right now....after 4 days and the withdrawal symptoms are starting to get further apart, which is great...so my mind goes ''well, if it's this easy, why not just have one''. I know your tricks!...but knowing the lie doesn't make it any less appealing.

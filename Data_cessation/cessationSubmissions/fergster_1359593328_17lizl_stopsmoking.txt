Day 29: I feel like Richard III

Today has been the worst day in about two weeks. I'm having major freaking cravings, my method no longer works (fists with toes and count down from 300). A cigarette a cigarette, my kingdom for a cigarette.

My wife has asked me to go and get gas in the car, I'm scared to go cos the gas station is where I always got my cigarettes. I want to go to the gym but scared I'll pop into the Walgreens beside it and buy cigarettes..

I'm on the brink of tears and my heart is beating a mile a minute!

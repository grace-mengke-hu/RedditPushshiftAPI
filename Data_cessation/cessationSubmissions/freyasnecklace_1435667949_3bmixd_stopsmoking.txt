Symptoms of Quitting

Anyone else have a sore throat and drainage AFTER you quit smoking? 
I'm still feeling pretty agitated all the time, but I do not think of smoking nearly as often. My anxiety is also high, as I think of how much I never want to be a smoker again. Allen Carr's book is helping-but I get pissed every time he writes it is easy.

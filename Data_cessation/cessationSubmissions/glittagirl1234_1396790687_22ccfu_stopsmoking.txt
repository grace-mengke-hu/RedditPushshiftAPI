Came back to say, Thanks!

Hi you sexy people. It has been 474 days since my last cigarette/nicotine of any kind. This subreddit really helped me out the first few months by giving me resources and support. In the first few weeks I would see someone with a :) in their star, signifying over a year w/o cigs, and it would seem near impossible that I would ever have that :). 

But now, I am over a year and I wanted to come back to reddit and show my support for the next gen of non-smokers. You can do it! Once you get over the physical addiction it is simply a matter of perseverance, which I know you are all capable of... A year may seem a long way away in your first few weeks or months, but everything really is a lot better without cigs and that year will go by so fast. It is literally like you stop killing yourself when you quit smoking. So once again, you can do it! You are better than that nicotine monster, and remember the acronym NOPE (not one puff ever).

*edit: Stats: quit when I was 23 y/o, smoked since I was 13, 1/2 pack a day since I was 16.

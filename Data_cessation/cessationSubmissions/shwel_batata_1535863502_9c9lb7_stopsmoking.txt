Hardest part is having to face all the feelings you’ve manage to avoid by stepping out for a smoke

Day 8 here. The last time I tried to quit I gave up around day 8 after going on downward spiral where I eventually decided I’d rather smoke than have to deal with all these emotions. 

I’ve moved away from family and I’m so homesick, but usually when I feel homesick I step outside and distract myself with a cigarette or 2. It works, I may not feel better but at least smoking disrupts my thoughts and I don’t have to deal with the loss of my social network right that moment. 

Today I cried like baby, literally gasping for air.. I’ve been avoiding this for so long but I guess I need to cry. Maybe it’s for the best that I deal with my emotions as hard as that it.

Smoking distracts us from dealing with emotions, I believe that’s a not a healthy thing. 

I do not to smoke to deal with my emotions any more because I am a non-smoker and so are you.

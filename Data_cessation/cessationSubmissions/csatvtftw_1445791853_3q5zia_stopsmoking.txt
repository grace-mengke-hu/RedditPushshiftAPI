6 weeks smoke-free. What changes did you notice around this time in your quitting journey?

I did some article reading relating to what happens in your body around the 1-2 month range, but it focused mainly on the biological stuff, which is great! But I want to know what changes you have noticed after a month or two of being smoke-free, once the cravings are gone and your body is working on repairing itself.

For me, my sleep habits have changed. I'm now tired earlier in the evening and that results in me going to bed earlier and then waking up earlier, allowing me to be well rested and productive in the morning. I'm also not tired throughout the day like I used to be. This might be a result of not having that late night, before bed cigarette.

Another thing is that exercise doesn't make me want to roll over and die. I went for a light run this morning, the first one since I quit, and I went a longer distance and time than I ever did while being a smoker. I also didn't feel like dying the whole time, or spend 30 minutes coughing up a lung when it was over; I felt awesome and energized, and could breathe easy.

On the flip side, I have gained about five pounds, which I read is fairly typical. But with running being so much easier now, it'll be simple to combat the weight gain!

Three weeks in and I'm just now hitting the non-smoking woes

I need something to remind me of why I am quitting - I ,iss the feeling so much. I'm three weeks in, down from a pack a day to one every few days, now to 5 days without sir ciggy. I need positive motivation that's not cheesy as he'll (a la LiveStrong quit app). 

I'm overweight and have already noticed my breathing improving tenfold, and I'm hitting up the gym starting tomorrow in hopes that is a motivator - but any help is appreciated.

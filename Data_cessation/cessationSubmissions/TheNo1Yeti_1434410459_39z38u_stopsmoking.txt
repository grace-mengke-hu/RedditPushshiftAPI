Feels like I'm going insane, is this normal?

So yesterday I quit smoking.  I have been a pack a day smoker for almost 25 years and have quit once before cold turkey for about 6 months before I fell back into it.

I stopped yesterday and ended up having a false start, ended up smoking 3 cigarettes.  Today haven't smoked any.  Let me just say, I have quit hard drugs cold turkey multiple times and never once was the detox from them as bad as this is. 

Time seems to be slowing down so that an hour feels like several.  I feel like I'm hallucinating and high.  I feel twitchy and keep breaking out in cold sweats. 

Last time I quit I don't remember feeling anything except restless and slightly more angry than normal.  This time I literally feel like I'm going to go nuts at any second.  Is this normal?  Did I just get off light last time?  Could it be because this time I'm taking Wellbutrin to help me not be so irritable and high strung and last time I wasn't?

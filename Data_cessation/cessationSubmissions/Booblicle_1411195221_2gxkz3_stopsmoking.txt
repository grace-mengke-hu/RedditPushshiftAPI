The Fremont Street Nausea Experience

Fremont Street Experience used to be kind of fun walking around, seeing what's new or different, checking out the girls, maybe even a drink or 2. During the night there was what I thought was a weak aroma of cigarettes usually within the casinos but not distracting. maybe just slightly noticeable. During the morning hours it was undetected. I've stayed clear from Fremont Street probably for 2 years or better. Well , that was until today. 

I went downtown to take care of some business, and since I was early I decided to walk down Fremont Street. This was 6 am in the morning when there is very little activity. As I got there, I found myself totally overwhelmed with cigarette smoke to the point of  almost gagging. and near the casinos it was amplified by 100. It was gross and disgusting, and was not enjoyable in any way. I walked into a casino intending to buy a coffee and noped myself right back out, and away from Fremont street.

I imagined myself cracking jokes about it to people: " Damn, do those people downtown get enough fresh air? " But then I recall that I was one of those among them.

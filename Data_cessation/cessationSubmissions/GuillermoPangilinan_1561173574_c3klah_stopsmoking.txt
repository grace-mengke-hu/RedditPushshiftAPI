I've gone 1.5 weeks without smoking and I'm feeling bouts of random melancholy sadness

I was a smoker for 5 years (a pack a day), started at the age of 25. The exact day I turned 30, I decided to quit as soon as I coughed up a little bit of blood one morning (only time). That was enough to scare the living hell out of me. After a few failed attempts, this is now the longest I've gone without a cigarette.

It has been a real weird ride since then. The first 3 days were absolutely the worst, but past that it got a little bit easier to manage. Around 5-11 days I was feeling pretty good. Was able to actually see results in physical demeanor, and had a little more energy, and wasn't feeling as anxious. 

And then today happened, and for some reason I've been feeling restless, anxious, even really very low at times. It's been like this for almost several hours. I've read articles online and its obvious I'm still not over the withdrawals. In a way I guess I'm asking the community here for a little bit of encouragement and more proof, I guess that feelings of depression are normal even 1.5 weeks in. If you say 3 months is the max, I'll feel pretty good about that too.

I've been treating this quitting thing like a video game, an extremely long grind. I'm usually eager to find out if the prize is worth it in the end. Will my feeling better even just 6 days in feel even better than that when I'm fully recovered 3 months in? I want to paint a mental portrait of how good it will feel when I get there. 

Otherwise I'm better off without ciggs. I know this now, and I'm sticking with it. I guess I'm just feeling a little worried with the possibility that I may have also had a depressive disorder I wasn't aware of, and was using cigarettes to mask it. Now that I'm off of it, I don't remember if this is how I've always felt like before the ciggs. I'm leaning more towards no because I feel like absolute shit right now haha.

Keeping on through a breakup

Dear fellow redditors, 
I have quit smoking for over three months, and felt no major difficulty. I hated every cigarette I smoked in the last five years, tried quitting twice every year (at new year and my birthday), felt guilty and was quite the hypochondriac. So quitting was actually a relief. Until...
Five days ago, the person I love and I broke up. The reasons are not bad ones, but I am very sad. And I want to smoke. So much. As I am typing this, I realize that I am seeking for permission to smoke.
Does anyone have a word of support for me? Please, I feel even lonelier in this...

Edit: I feel that I need to to thank you, because your answers/response have brought me something good that helped. The guitar is a black used Les Paul studio, with which I'll compose a few songs to "document my pain". Again: thank you. I am holding on and not smoking. It is a great gift I made to myself and I will not throw it away.

How bad is Champix (Chantix) really?

I bought Champix the other day and took my first pill this morning. After that I had the brilliant idea to search on reddit or opinions about this product and almost all of them were horror stories. After reading more and more, i felt worse and worse. Really sick. Now I don't know if it's from my first pill or if its placebo. I know that there are some serious side effects but I thought they weren't all that common. Reading all those horror posts makes me want to stop taking it and waste 130â‚¬. I'm 23 and smoke aroudn 10-13 cigarettes a day. I've been smoking since I was 16 and always smoked the same amount.

Should I go on and finish this 4 week pack. Should I finish it and don't increase the dose over 0,5 mg?

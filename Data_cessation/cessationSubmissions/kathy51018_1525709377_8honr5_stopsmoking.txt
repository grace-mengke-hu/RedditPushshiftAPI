Iâ€™m so terrified. I have panic attacks just thinking about it

I am quitting smoking on Thursday night at 10 PM . I have been a heavy smoker for 30 years. I have only quit two times in the past 30 years. the last time I quit was 18 years ago.  I smoke 30 to 40 a day and I am terrified but I have to stop wish me luck....

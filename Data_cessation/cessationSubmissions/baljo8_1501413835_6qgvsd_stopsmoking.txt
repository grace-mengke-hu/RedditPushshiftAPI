starting tomorrow

hello fellow quitter and soon to be quitters, 
So i made a deal with my SO that starting tomorrow July 31st I will quit smoking for good. I tried several times before last time being 2 months ago where i went 12 days without smoking then i took a puff which turned into a pack a day. 
if you guys have any tips or words of encouragement please throw them my way. 
god bless you all

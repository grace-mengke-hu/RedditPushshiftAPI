Found out I'm going to be a dad. I'm done with this.

After months upon months of trying, my wife and I found out last week that she's pregnant with our first child. We're in our mid-thirties, with no previous children, so needless to say we're excited.

I don't want to cause any harm to my unborn child. I want to be there for him or her for a long time.

To that end, I am giving up my pack-a-day habit. I smoked my last cigarette Saturday night.

This is difficult. I'm chewing the 4mg nicotine gum like a mad man, and constantly shoving a cinnamon stick in my mouth.

I can do this! If not for me, for my wife and future child.

I got the star

​
¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Seems so far away in time, when I thought about getting here, at 1 MONTH. 

So far, it's OK.

I still feel like recovering. My energy levels are getting normal. I can awake early morning like I did before quitting. Still problems in the STOMACH section. I started running on a tread mill since yesterday, and I hope that will solve the problem. 

And yes, I still come here to read posts people write. I enjoy those from quitters who are far or much farther than me in their quit and give detailed descriptions of their life as a non smoker. 

Thanks.

I think I can do it because:
1. I understood I'm an addict to something that does absolutely nothing to me, except hijacking my brain.  
2.  I understood I'm an addict for life. My brain is set-up to change easily to that of a smoker, if I just give it some smoke. So no cigar, never ever for me.

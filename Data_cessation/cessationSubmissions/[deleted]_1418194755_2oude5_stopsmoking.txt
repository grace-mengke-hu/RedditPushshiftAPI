Please convince my dad to stop smoking

My dad has quit about 4 times now but he keeps on smoking. All he ever does is smoke and he developed a very bad smokers cough. I do not like to hear the sound of this cough every five seconds so I lock myself in my room. I don't know my dad anymore because I don't even talk to him. I cannot stand the sound of a cough, and my dad coughs several times per minute. This has been going on for a year and now it is effecting me in a lot of bad ways. Please help me convince him to quit so I can be with my family again.

19 days down the toilet

I nearly beat my last record of 21 days nicotine free, but after some bad news I went back to my old friend. I crushed the rest of the packet this morning and am back at it. Withdrawals are there but no where near as severe as the first, second, third time. 

Does anyone have any tips for pushing through heartbreak without a cigarette?

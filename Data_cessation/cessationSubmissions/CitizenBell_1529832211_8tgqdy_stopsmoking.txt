Alternatives to Smoke Breaks at Work

Hi everyone,

I have quite a stressful job, and part of the way I manage it is by taking 10 mins outside here and there throughout the day as an alternative to a longer lunch break.

Does anybody have any alternatives I could use instead of going for a cigarette break but still be able to go outside? There's no seating areas outside at work so I can't just go out for a sit. But I feel like if I go out there I need something to replace the cigarettes, or it's all too tempting to walk 2 mins to the shop and buy a pack.

I've got an e-cig but I'm not crazy about using them either.

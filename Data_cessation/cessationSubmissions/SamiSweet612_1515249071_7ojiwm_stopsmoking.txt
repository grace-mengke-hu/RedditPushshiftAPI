Sore throat on Day 3

So my partner has bronchitis and some kind of cold and has been hone sick all week, dying coughing and super congested. 

All the sudden two nights ago I felt my throat getting sore and sure enough it's not gone away. I have a little congestion too but mostly my throat is killing me. 

Did I catch my partner's cold or is this related to stopping smoking? It's annoying because I want to work out to stay distracted but I dont want to go anywhere if I am contagious.

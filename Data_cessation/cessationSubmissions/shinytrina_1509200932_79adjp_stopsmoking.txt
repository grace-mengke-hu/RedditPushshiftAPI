All I can think of since waking up is having a cigarette

This is the worst that my cravings have been in quite some time.  Usually I want to smoke when I wake up, but it goes away after a small bit, yet for some reason today I have been up for almost 2.5 hours and I still want to go buy a pack.  Going to take a nap and hope that I feel better when I wake up.

Day Two - No Sleep

Any recommendations for sleeping?  I've had horrible sleep issues when withdrawing from drug/alcohol addiction and the cigarette always seemed like my one vice that relaxed me enough to fall asleep.  Now that I'm attempting to quit my "crutch" that got me through other addictions, I'm finding it much more difficult to relax enough to fall asleep.  Good thing is I have decided to be a non-smoker during a period of unemployment (job hunting after finishing grad school/internship) so I have a few weeks to allow for a crazy schedule.  Still, I have to sleep.....

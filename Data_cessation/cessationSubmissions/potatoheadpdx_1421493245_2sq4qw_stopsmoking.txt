Anybody want to be my quitting buddy?

Just an idea I had. I haven't quit yet, but I'm thinking about it more and more. I have a hard time staying accountable to myself, though. I'm also pretty competitive. So I'm thinking, if someone else has been lurking here, and hasn't quit yet, but is thinking about it, maybe we could quit at the same time? And we could pm each other encouragement, vent to each other when we're having cravings, etc. I feel like it would be good for me to have a specific person I can talk to who's at the same stage of quitting. Also, I think I'd be less likely to give up and smoke if I can say, "Well, so-and-so hasn't smoked yet, so I won't either." Anybody else think this sounds like a good idea and want to be my quitting buddy?

If it matters, I'm on the west coast of the US. It's about 3 am now. (Yeah, I sleep like shit.)

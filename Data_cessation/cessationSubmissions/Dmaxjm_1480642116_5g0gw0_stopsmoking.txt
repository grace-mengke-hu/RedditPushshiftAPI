So the struggle begins.

I just recently decided to stop smoking and it's absolutely killing me. I've been a pack a day smoker since my first out of four deployments within the military. Years and years of stress and multiple excuses kept me smoking day to day. Well I tried quitting cold turkey about 3 weeks ago and made it 5 days before a relapse. The worst part... I was doing good but my wife continued to smoke around me and probably didn't help much on my attempt. Now it's been 3 days since my 2nd attempt at cold turkey and yet my wife is still smoking around me.  For some reason I'm able to make it through multiple days cold turkey but I do have the option to try Chantix if needed.  I just don't want to rely on a drug to make me quit.  I also feel if I went to get the drug since it's not an instant stop smoking drug and instead increasingly works, I feel as if that would just give me a reason to relapse and let the drug work slowly to quit.  I need some tips, tricks, advice, because I don't want to fall back into my first failed attempt.  Thanks ahead of time!

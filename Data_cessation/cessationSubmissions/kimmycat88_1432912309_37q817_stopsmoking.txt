A little trick that is really helping.

So I've mentioned it a few times in comments on this sub but its working so well for me that I thought I'd share. Its basically carrying a bottle of water around with you everywhere you go (I have one with a built in straw. I feel like that's relevant because of the sucking) and every time you would usually hit a cigarette, take a drag of water. Smoke while driving? Drink while driving. Have a lunch time bench you like to sit at and smoke? Take your water there. Eventually you go through this smoke=drink sickness where you're so full of water you don't want to intake anything, not even smoke. Continue with that method for a few days and your brain kind of does this Pavlov's dog thing where thinking of smoking equals thinking of that gross sloshy too full of water feeling and you just want none of that. For people just starting out like me I seriously recommend trying this. Just be prepared for frequent bathroom trips.

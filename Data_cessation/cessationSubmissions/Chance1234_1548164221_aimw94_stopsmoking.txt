Time management out the window ...

Ok, so on day 31 smoke-free and this is driving me nuts. Before giving up, I pretty much planned my day around cigarettes. ie. I would do a task , have a cigarette, plan what I was going to do between now and the next whilst smoking that cig. 

I have to say, it was a pretty foolproof way of working as that time between was really sleeves rolled up and uber focus. I am struggling to find my focus and my productivity has nose dived. 

Anyone experience anything similiar ?

Hello fellow quitters, I have some questions and would appreciate the support

So I’m at day 13 and my 1st week wasn’t really that bad. It was actually kind of enjoyable but this second one has been much more difficult. I’ve had more cravings and mood swings recently. I’m having some crazy low blood sugar type of things happening. Feeling faint, weak and out of it. I try to eat often and Im otherwise healthy and have been trying to exercise when I can. Would love to hear from those ahead of me if any of this sounds normal. The anxiety has kinda gotten the best of me thinking my blood sugar is permanently screwed up or this is my new normal.

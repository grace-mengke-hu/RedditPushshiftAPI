Is it still life damaging to smoke one or two a day?

I have been off cigarettes for about a week now, managed to cut down from a packet to three a day and then cold turkey. I can exercise easily and generally enjoy sitting outside with my partner, it is tempting to have one with her but I do have control, just wondering if anyone knows the effect from not a habit but just a casual now and then.

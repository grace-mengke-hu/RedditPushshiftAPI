I dream about smoking almost every night. When I wake up I feel so dejected and ashamed that I started smoking again. Woke up crying once. What will I tell my wife? All those days of torture for nothing! I can't believe I... wait... I dreamt that. Nevermind. Presenting #026 Raichu. See you tomorrow.

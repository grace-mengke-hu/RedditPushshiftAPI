Day 1; the best day I have had in the last five years

In my 5 years as a smoker (m/21) i have crushed many packs of smokes. Out of anger, out of frustration, sadness, sickness, etc. everytime resulted in buying another pack within the next few hours or days. Yesterday I finished reading Allen Carr's "The Easy Way to Stop Smoking". I have been carrying my last partial pack of smokes around in my pocket all day, and laughing whenever the thought occurs to me to light up. I am happy, I feel no anger or tension. I have broken free of a very simple cage and I am not worried about ever getting stuck again. I would greatly appreciate any questions about how Allen Carrs book and about my experience. Any smoker should read this book. After all, what do you have to lose

Tips on quitting smoking on a college budget?

Hi all, I am a college student and I really really want to stop smoking. I am currently at around a pack every two days or so (during finals it gets worse). All of my roommates smoke and its hard to say no when i'm offered it. I seriously want to quit and i've tried several times to go cold turkey but i tend to get really anxious and can't concentrate well in class so I usually relapse. I am broke and don't have the money to buy a vape and all the cartridges for the kit. How can I start on my process to quitting and at the same time retain my focus and keep anxiety down?

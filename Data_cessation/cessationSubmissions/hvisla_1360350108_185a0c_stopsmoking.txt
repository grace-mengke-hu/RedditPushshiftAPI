Boyfriend and I are both quitting!

Mostly for money reasons, as we find that half of what we have goes to smokes and we decided after my card was declined a few days ago it was time to stop.

I've only been smoking a year or so, so it's been a lot easier for me. My boyfriend, however, has been smoking on and off for almost 10 years. He's weaning himself off (he's down to 2 a day!) while I've gone cold turkey.

Cravings are pretty intense at times, but I'm able to distract myself better now. I'm just really excited to have money for important things again!

Day 21

So I'm 31, over the last 10 years I have been unhappy with my weight and the impact smoking is having on my life and up until recently  all I had been doing about it was whinging about it. I woke up on the 1st of Jan and decided being an overweight smoker was no longer for me. 
I threw my cigarettes in the bin and didn't look back. I threw myself into a weight loss programme online which made me start cooking fresh food and trying new recipes. Touch wood it's going ok, no smoking and a 7lb loss so far !!  Admittedly I haven't touched an alcoholic drink as I am worried it will have a negative impact on both smoking and weight loss, any ideas on how to beat this ? I know I will not be able to never have a glass of 🍷 again 😄😄

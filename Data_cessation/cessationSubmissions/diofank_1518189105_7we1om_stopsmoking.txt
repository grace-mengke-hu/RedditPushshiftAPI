I thought these are cravings

So far, I have mistaken the following feelings for cravings:

- hunger

- thirst

- being tired

- happiness

- being anxious 

- a normal headache

...and the list goes on.


What I was meaning to say with this post is that all of the above are normal things people feel. While a smoker, I used to "cure" all of them with a cigarette (needless to say they don't really help). Dammit, non-smokers feel the same stuff and they don't get the urge to go outside for a cancer roll and label everything they feel "cravings".

After this realisation I haven't had any cravings whatsoever, just normal stuff people feel.

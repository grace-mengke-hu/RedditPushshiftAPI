Got drunk last night, didn't smoke!

I didn't set out to get drunk, but I ended up getting pretty toasted. I was around other smokers all night long, even while they were smoking, and I didn't smoke. I even had someone ask if I had a cigarette and I got to say "No, I don't smoke".  
  
Here's to small victories and a killer hangover.

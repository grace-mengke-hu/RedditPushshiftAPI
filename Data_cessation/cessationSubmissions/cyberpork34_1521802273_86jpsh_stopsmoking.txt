Trying a different approach

I haven't bought a pack of cigarettes in a few months. Instead, I've been hand rolling cigarettes. My (likely flawed) logic behind this is that I want to get used to the idea of not seeing every gas station, corner store, and pharmacy as a place to buy tobacco. The few stores in my area that sell half decent rolling tobacco are few and far between. And out of the way of my regular commute. It also helps that I have to take time to create every cigarette that I smoke. I do feel as though these mental roadblocks that I've set for myself have started to curb my tobacco consumption and save me a good bit of money compared to buying box after box after box. Any input on this strategy and helpful next steps would be appreciated.

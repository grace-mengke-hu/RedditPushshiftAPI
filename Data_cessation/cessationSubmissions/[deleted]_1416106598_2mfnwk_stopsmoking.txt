Help me please!

I'm on day 17 and its been a solid week since I've had any real problems outside of a few 5 minute long cravings here and there. 

But today we found out one of my brother's highschool/childhood friends killed himself. I'm really worried that when I get off work and go see him, he'll start smoking and I'll light one up with him. I want to right now just thinking about it. all I want to do right now is go give my brother a hug, crack open a beer, and smoke one on the balcony with him. 

Why all of a sudden do i have this nagging urge with no confidence that I'll resist?

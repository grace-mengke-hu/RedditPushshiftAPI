Fuck, I somehow made it to day 2. #TheJourneyContinues

What a weird day yesterday. I've never felt so sick. The cravings were surreal, my mood was riding the biggest rollercoaster ever, and my head wanted to implode. I don't know what to say. But I determined, let's get to day 4!  Chewing gum helped a lot, even tho I hate it so much. Lol

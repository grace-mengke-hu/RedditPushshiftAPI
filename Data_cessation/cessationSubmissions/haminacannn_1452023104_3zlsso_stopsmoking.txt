There are just some days that it's much harder than others

Does anyone ever get really sad when they stop smoking cigarettes? I feel stressed out and kinda depressed but my silly brain keeps hinting at how if I smoke or vape it's going to make me happier and relaxed. I know it's not true but for some reason I keep coming back to this. Just one will make everything better in the meantime but then it spirals out and becomes a pack...ahhh!

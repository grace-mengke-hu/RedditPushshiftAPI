I just quit smoking

Last Wed. I think the most important part to remember is no matter what, don't buy another pack. I'm chewing the gum right now, but as long as I can get some leverage on the physiological response, I think the behavioral response will change, and then the psychological response too. The gum costs about the same as a pack. Buy the gum. Flush out the toxins with water. Get the life. Etc.

Yay ME!

Over two weeks without a smoke!  I've had my very trying times but I feel such a sense of pride when I make it through those times. I kept asking myself "When will it get easier?"
Well, so far I can say, it doesn't get easier. But my resolve and techniques have gotten better. Soooooo...YAY ME!

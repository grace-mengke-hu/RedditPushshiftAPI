I have doing so terribly

I feel like I'm not even trying anymore, I keep wasting money on cigarettes.  It's so bad and I'm not taking care of myself.  Things have been a mess for me so I use life problems as an excuse.  I need to get in shape but i dont know how to start caring enough..  i already smoked today so i must not be that serious.. I'm going to regret it when I'm on my death bed. I'm 41 is there still hope for me?

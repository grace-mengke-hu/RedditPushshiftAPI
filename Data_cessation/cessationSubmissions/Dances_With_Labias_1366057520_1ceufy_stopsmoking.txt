On my sixth day now. Really think I may succeed this time. Just need some encouragement.

Most of the time, I can curtail the cravings.  But once in a while it hits like the devil himself.  I know my brothers and sisters are going through the same, and we're all in this together.  I just need some encouraging words to look back to when it gets bad.

Good luck to all of you

Vaping?

Hi everyone, 
After several failed attempts to stop smoking, I decided to go for a lesser evil and tried vaping. It’s only been a week but it seems to be working great. No need to smoke at all. I’m curious to hear other people’s experiences with vaping as an NRT option and how lasting that switch can be. 

Thanks!

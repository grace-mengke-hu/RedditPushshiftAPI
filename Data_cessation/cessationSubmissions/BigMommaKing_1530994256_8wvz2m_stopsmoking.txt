Tried and failed multiple times,what am I doing wrong? (Other than smoking still)

I’ve been smoking for about 3.5 years. Quit for a brief period while I was pregnant with my daughter. Started smoking again when she got colic at 3m and haven’t been able to break the habit again. 

My first quit I gradually cut down the amount I smoked and I wouldn’t smoke more than half a cigarette at a time. 

I tried that this time and just keep going back for more now. I also tried patches and the blu ecig to no avail. I feel like I’m not getting anywhere cause I’m still getting nicotine and still dependent on it so I have the same issues. 

My husband also smokes and wants to quit together but after failed attempts and being so moody towards one another we thought it best to quit separately. 

I’m a stay at home mom and am going to school but want to try to quit before classes start again in August. I always get so mean towards my daughter who is 15m and I hate that. I tell myself it’s just temporary but I always come running back to nicotine. 

Any advice or help would be much appreciated!

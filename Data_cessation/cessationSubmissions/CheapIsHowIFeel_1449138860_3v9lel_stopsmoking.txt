quit in August, but this past week has been tough

thank god this sub is here... typed in "quit smoking" in the search field and there you are, and I need you.  I DID quit.  In August.  But I am having such a hard time this past week... especially the past 5 days... and the past 2 days in particular I've had to DRAG MYSELF away from stores so I won't buy cigarettes.  I have actually driven, sat in the parking in lot and then forced myself to leave.  I just want to give in.  I need some support.

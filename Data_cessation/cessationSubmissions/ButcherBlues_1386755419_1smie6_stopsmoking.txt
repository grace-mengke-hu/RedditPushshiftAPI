Knew this subreddit for a long time, I think it's time I subscribe. How effective is e-cigs/gum/patches? Am I better off cold turkey?

I have no money to be buying cigarettes but I think it's time I quit. I notice my lung capacity is terrible and it's an awful habit. 

I smoke a lot though (12.5g pouch of tobacco every two days) and everyone in my country smokes tobacco in joints. I've been trying to quit over the past week, relapsed 3 times, last time being last night but I'm ready to start again.

I'm getting a bit of cash in tomorrow so I will be able to start buying tobacco again but I really don't want to do it. Are patches and other nicotine related products a good alternative? OR is the nicotine still keeping me hooked?

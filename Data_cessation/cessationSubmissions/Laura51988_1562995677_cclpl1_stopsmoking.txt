Nervous about being around old high school friends who chain smoke for the first time since quitting

I have plans to spend time with a few friends from high school . I haven’t seen them in a few years and it’s the first time I’ll be around them as a non-smoker. This will also be the first time drinking since I’ve quit (I’ve been quit for 2 months now) 

For the most part I’m pretty strong in my resolve to stay quit but I hear a good majority of relapses happens whilst drinking , so that makes me nervous. On top of that I’ll be celebrating my friends wedding with a bunch of chain smokers . I’m nervous I won’t enjoy my time as much , or feel like I’m missing out by not smoking since I’ll be drinking and probably won’t be in a rational state of mind. 

Any words of advice on how to keep my shit together while drinking and around chain smokers for the first time ?

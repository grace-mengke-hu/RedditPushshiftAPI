Same old question.

I have been pretty heavily smoking for 4 years (about a pack a day at my worst) and after countless attempts to quit, I finally managed to stay off cigarettes for about 8 months. A week ago I was feeling down and after roaming around convenience store for good 2 hours I went and bought a pack. So I relapsed, but today decided to jump back on the quitting train. 

What I\`m really worried about that even after 8 months I had a craving so strong that I was walking around in the cold for 2 hours fighting a mental war in my head. Is this what my life is going to be forever? Do the cravings ever go away? 

Feeling desperate.

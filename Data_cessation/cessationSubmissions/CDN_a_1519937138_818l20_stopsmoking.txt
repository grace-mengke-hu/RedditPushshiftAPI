Tried... failed... trying again...

This is not easy... ! And on top of everything I have a psycho ex who won't stop harassing me... my partner died... LIFE... in other words I guess....?? But I'd like to remain alive thank you very much! So I stopped for a day... panicked...  thought I'd never be happy again... watched Allen Carr... and am trying again.... until I panic next???? What is up with the moment when you break down... and make that decision to do something stupid? Thank for any help.

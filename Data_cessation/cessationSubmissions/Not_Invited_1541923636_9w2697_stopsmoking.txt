Surrounded in the smoking area.

I was at a show last night and popped out to the smoking area with my partner as he vapes. 

It was really small, they'd barriered us in to a two person width, meaning I had to navigate around people blowing smoke in my face. I was very close to beginning to ask around for a cigarette.

I went to leave in a huff, thinking how dare my partner could put me in this position. However I bumped into an acquaintance on the way out and had a little chat. I could have asked her for a cigarette easy and not even have felt guilty. 

But I didn't!! Over a week conquered now! I never thought I would be able to do this cold turkey but here I am!

Even if I still smoked, that smoking area was way too small for anything.

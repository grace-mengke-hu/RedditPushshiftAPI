Almost 2 years!!

I am coming up on 2 years and I feel amazing! I used nicotine patches to help me quit for anyone interested and the mobile app Cessation Nation really helped me too!

As for some benefits off the top of my head, I no longer cough all the time and I do not have that nasty mucus at the back of my throat when I wake up. I can take deep breaths without coughing, my hands and feet don't feel as cold in the winter because of improved circulation. I am not as short of breath when I work out and I have saved so much money! And there is so many other benefits I've noticed as well. It was so worth it!

For those who are just quitting, keep it up and don't give up! I cheated a few times during the first couple weeks but I didn't let it break me, I kept going. I rarely ever get urges anymore and the smell of cigarette smoke makes me feel sick now. I am 30 now and smoked since I was about 16ish. And I feel very proud of myself for making it this far. Happy Holidays to everyone!

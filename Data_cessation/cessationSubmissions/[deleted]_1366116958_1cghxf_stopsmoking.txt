[T-4 days] let's get ready to rumble!

Going with the patch; worked for me before. My daughter (in sarcastic humor that she gets from me) helped me pick my "drop date" of 4/20! 

Edit: brain chimed in. DAE increase the # of smokes prior to quit date? Since I set my date & got patches: it's been a smoking train! Not good!

Thank you for the encouragement: I read the posts/replies & find this support to be fantastic!

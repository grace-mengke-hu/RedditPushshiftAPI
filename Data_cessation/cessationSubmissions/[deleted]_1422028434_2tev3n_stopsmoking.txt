One year today!

Hi /r/stopsmoking - long time no see! The truth is, I haven't needed this thread for a very long time now, but it was invaluable to me the first few weeks of quitting. I had a place to vent and an outlet where everyone else was going through a similar struggle. 

But after a few weeks, the struggle became non-existent and I stopped wanting cigarettes even on the rare instances I thought about them. They are no longer a part of my life. When I'm around a smoker, I'm much more disgusted than tempted, and my body has also responded much more favorably (if only I exercised!). 

My advice to anyone serious about quitting is to read the Alan Carr book, hang out on this thread whenever you want a cigarette and upvote everyone on the board, and remember that your so-called cravings are actually withdrawal symptoms. You can totally do this. It's easier than you think.

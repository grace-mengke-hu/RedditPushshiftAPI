2 years down, you can do it too.

Being a smoker seems like a distant and unpleasant memory. I'm in the best shape I've been since 2001 and the only real effect nicotine has in my life at this point is that I'm aware I'm addicted and need to stay away.

You all have the strength to quit and this place definitely helps. I stay subscribed as a reminder so I don't go back.

Help me deal with the mood swings?

I've recently quit smoking on the first (yeah I know new years resolution so clich√©). I've smoked for about 7 years and this is the first time I've made a legitimate effort to stop. Its been almost a week since I've decided to stop and not smoking isn't that bad but the mood swings are really really getting to me. I'm getting quite depressed, feeling down and I'm feeling jittery. Sometimes I'll stand around, or pace around my house debating to just buy a pack to feel better. I'm on the brink of tears sometimes. 

Why do I feel this way, what can I do to help with my mood swings. My depression is getting worse, I don't even feel good about quitting I just know its something I have to do.

Edit: Thankyou guys for your responses. It's helped alot! Here it is 7am in the morning here and I can't sleep. I really want a cigarette, but I don't need one! I think I can finally sleep. Thank you guys for your moving responses.

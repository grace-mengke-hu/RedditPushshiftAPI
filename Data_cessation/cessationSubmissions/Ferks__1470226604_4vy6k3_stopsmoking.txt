Second time quitting, hopefully the last. Don't know if I should chew nicorette or not.

I'm 23 and been smoking for 7 years, I don't want to do this anymore. I've quit once before for two weeks, then got drunk and bought a pack. It felt so good smoking my first cigarette after "quitting" last time, but by the time I finished the pack I felt like shit again. 
I only smoke about 10 a day, but still I can feel the effects on my body. I wish I never smoked in the first place. 
So I'm having my last cigarette right after I send this, then trying to stick to it this time. I'm considering getting some nicorette gum for when the cravings get bad in a few days, but I don't want to get addicted to gum. Anyone with experience with nicorette? Did it help? Was it easy to quit the gum? 

Wish me luck, and good luck to everyone.

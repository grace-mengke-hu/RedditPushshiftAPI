Day 3, having a real hard time falling asleep!

So i quit 3 days ago and for the past 2 nights I had the hardest time falling asleep ever... it takes me 3-4 hours to fall asleep! At least i don't have carvings that much so I have that going for me which is nice. Anyone encountered this  problem, and any solutions?

Here's some unsolicited advice: Replace the bad habit with a good one.

I still miss smoking all the time. I am still tempted. I still want to smoke and it's been well over a year since I quit.

But I quit for a reason. I wanted to run. I wanted to run and run and run. I wanted to see what my body could do if I took care of it and worked as hard as I could.

I ran two different 5k races this summer. I ran and I ran so fast that I started flying. 

Learning to run was much harder than quitting smoking but running makes me feel incredible. It makes my body feel so good and sore and I have so much energy and I'm just genuinely happier. 

Every time I thought about smoking and every time I think about smoking now, I find myself thinking "oh how awesome would a cigarette be right now? Oh right... not as awesome as a run and I guess I can't have both!"

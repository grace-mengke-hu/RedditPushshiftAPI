Quit smoking, It's going well but im worried

Hi guys.

Just a little back story, I quit roughly november last year but still smoked when I went out for some drinks (most weekends) until June this year when I went back to full time smoking after a holiday.

Now I've decided to quit again (started Monday) and it's going great. However im trying to do it this time without smoking while going out.

Any tips on this guys?

Day 1 of quitting

Hi there, I'm a 24 year old female that has been smoking on and off since I was 16. I smoke about 3 packs a week, but I am very dependent on them. I bought an e cig to help me quit, but it's honestly more harsh than smoking. Any suggestions on vape brands or tips? It's been 3 years since I last tried quitting. Any help is appreciated!!

What do you guys do when you have a stress related problem ?

I’m on day 6 on my quit journey and i’ve been a smoker for the past 8 years with a pack a day. 

I just had an argument with my partner and i stormed out of the apartment really frustrated and upset. I tried walking around the block and heavy breathing and i could manage the craving but man, it was the hardest thing ever. The whole time all i wanted to do was to smoke a cigarette. What do you guys do when you face situations like this ? Any suggestions?

Weirdness at day 10

Ok. I'm not sure if this is normal, but I feel like a fraud. I feel like I'm just a pretend non smoker. I don't know if this makes any sense, but it's like I've just infiltrated the non smoker world with my smoker self.

It's weird. Maybe it's because people have started to notice me not smoking and have been giving me compliments and encouragement for that, but I still feel like a smoker.

Can anyone relate to this or should I check myself in somewhere? :D

Anyway, I could still go for a smoke, but those kind of cravings are easily dismissed at this point. It's just a passing thought that comes and goes and doesn't really bother me anymore. I should probably quit the patch at this point. Maybe I won't put one on tomorrow when it's time to change.

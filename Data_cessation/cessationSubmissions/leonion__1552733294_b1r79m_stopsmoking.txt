When should I start counting the days ?

I've been cigarette free for two weeks, and I don't miss them at all, but all of this is thanks to a e-cigarette I acquired which helped a lot (I never went that far when I previously tried to stop smoking). I plan on cutting the nicotine (I use 3mg, which is the lowest dose) when I'm done with this years exams. I was wondering if I should consider having quit smoking when I stop nicotine, when I stop vaping (It will be the next objective), or simply that I have already. I know it is not that important but knowing where I am in the process is very encouraging, so what do you think ?

3 weeks in

Haven't smoked in just over 3 weeks and feeling good about it. I've tried to quit in the past countless times, threw away so many full packs of cigarettes it was ridiculous. Before the 3 weeks of being smoke free I was going through another quit attempt which lasted 5 days. After a stressful situation I bought a pack and chainsmoked, I felt terrible for doing that. I realized the cigarettes did not solve any problems and that they are pointless. I did not want to feel that way again and tossed out another pack, here I am 3 weeks in which is my most successful attempt yet. The cravings are pretty much gone and I don't think of smoking as much anymore. It does get easier as time goes on. Cigarettes are designed to keep people addicted for life, I didn't want to be one of those people who fell for it. Good luck everyone, if you fail just keep trying. Don't give up. Smoking isn't worth it.

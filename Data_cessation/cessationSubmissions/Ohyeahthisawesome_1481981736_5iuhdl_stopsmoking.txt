Rough week and struggling

I need to vent somewhere... today is day 13 and it's only 6 am and I'm fighting craving after craving. I've had a bad week, with going to the hospital with horrible chest pain (no cause found), got the flu, am getting some medical test results today that I'm not expecting to be good, though not smoking related. I am a single parent and have been dealing with illness and stress and kids and work alone while doing my best to care for other people. I am having peak anxiety right now, and I feel so overwhelmed and unsupported. I want to go back to the crutch that is smoking.  I am not planning on doing so, but this is so hard right now. Encouragement would be very appreciated.

Meant to check in at 90 days. I forgot, so it's 92 :)

Again, just another check-in. I've passed various benchmarks such as a few nights out, a high school reunion, and a work crisis. When I wanted to smoke, I told my boyfriend and other friends, "I want a cigarette so badly. I mean, I definitely don't, but I physically do." That helped me get through.

Again, the best way to fight the craving that was to see it for what it was: I was feeling uncomfy, and in the moment, a cigarette seemed like it would get rid of that feeling. In truth, a cigarette would make me feel jittery, smelly, and, at this point in the process, extremely disappointed in myself.

So, yay. I think the biggest challenge now is the idea that I could handle a drag or two. Whenever I feel that way, I ask myself, "What would be the point of that?" When all else fails, I treat myself to a chocolate or something. 

Good luck to everyone!

As of this hour it has been 3 weeks since I quit. I have never felt so anxious and sad in so long.

For the physical side, I feel better and healthy and such. I can see the positives and I treat myself for when I don't have a cigarette.

But I just can't help but feel sad and miserable all the time. I'm constantly anxious about what people think and the past is creeping up on me big style. It's difficult to cope with bad memories and such but it's just effecting my mood everywhere. I can't escape the sadness, I know it's just a mental effect from quitting but I just can't seem to cheer the fuck up.

I can hardly concentrate on any of my assignments for University either and the deadlines are cropping up...I just have bad feelings and bad thoughts floating around in my head constantly that I just can't focus on anything else.

Redditers, what do? :(

Be Strong this holiday season!

Just wanted to give a shout out for a happy (and successful) holiday for you and your family. For those of you with < 3 months smoke free, be strong. This time of year we see family members that smoke, maybe the person we started smoking with. There will be pressures to smoke from family, friends, or co-workers as you head to each holiday party. Be strong, stay convicted to your new smoke free life! You can do this, you were a non smoker before, earlier in your life, be that strong non-smoker this holiday season! 

Have a happy holiday season!

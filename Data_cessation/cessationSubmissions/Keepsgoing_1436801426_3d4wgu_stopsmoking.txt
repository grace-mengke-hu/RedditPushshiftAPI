I'm at the very beginning stages. Can I ask if you have these smoking-related issues? (tmi)

I'm currently about a pack a day smoker. I'm starting the journey to eventually quit. I'm not sure how, but you people help to motivate me. I have many current health issues; I'm curious to know who has suffered any of these and have discovered that they are related to smoking.         

As embarrassing as it is, I'm unable to have controlled and effective bowel movements. I am unable to 'push' or bear-down. I think that it may be tied in with my breathing troubles, and perhaps with the diaphragm. I can't exhale/inhale properly. My lungs feel okay, it's concentrated in the abdomen. Has anyone had a similar observation?    

Has anyone had changes in blood levels or hormone levels due to smoking?       

Thanks for taking the time to read this.

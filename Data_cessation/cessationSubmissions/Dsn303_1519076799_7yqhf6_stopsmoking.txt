On how miserably I failed

7 months smoke free and I made exactly the same mistake when I started. I started smoking socially. This time at work, even though, I got the job as a non smoker. My smoke free time was a precious time and I’ll quit again soon. I’ve learned a lot about myself and the addiction. How it works, what helps me when I struggle with cravings. I made a promise to myself that I’ll give up smoking before or on my 30th birthday which is quite soon. To people who try to quit: quit and don’t start again. It’s a big deal but it’s possible. Good luck! I’ll be back as a non smoker in few months :)

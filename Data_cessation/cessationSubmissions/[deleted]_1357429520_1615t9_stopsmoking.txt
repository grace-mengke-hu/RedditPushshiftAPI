Instead of going out

It's Saturday night, I'm on day 5 and the cravings are pretty intense. I've barely left the house all week because basically everything makes me want a cigarette, especially drinking. I'm sitting here watching football, listening to music, cooking, flossing, doing jumping jacks, whatever to keep my mind off of smoking. The thing is, I live in New Orleans and Mardi Gras starts in 2 weeks, so I think I'm just going to have to be a hermit until the physical cravings are totally gone. Then maybe I can catch a parade or two!

Anyone else find they have to shun the outside world for a few weeks to be successful at quitting long-term?

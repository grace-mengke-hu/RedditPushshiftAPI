Suddenly Stopping

It was Sunday evening and I’m relaxing until I finally decide I’m going to smoke one last cigarette and head to bed... as I’m laying in bed I just think to myself “I’m quitting tomorrow, cold turkey, I’m going to do it”. After 2 years of smoking a pack a day, i just decided to quit, out of nowhere... weird and unlike me. I hadn’t thought about quitting at all, let alone if I was going to smoke before or after breakfast in the morning. But here I am, at the end of day 2 smoke free. Maybe there’s an underlying reason that I’m not consciously aware of as to why I’m quitting? Can anyone relate?

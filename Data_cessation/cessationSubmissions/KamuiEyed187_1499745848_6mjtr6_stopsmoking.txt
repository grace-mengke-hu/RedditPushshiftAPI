Is my risk of cancer high ?

Hey, I am actually 17 years old (turning 18 soon.) and quitted smoking about a week ago. I usually smoked up to 10 cigs per day and that for roughly 2 years, since I am a pretty paranoid person I wanted to ask you guys how high my risk of cancer caused by that is.

I actually never have to cough if it isn't caused by a cold, and my lungs/breath are perfect according to what my doctor said in the recent check.

What are some ways you deal with anxiety?

Smoking for me is not just the nicotine - its also having something to do, something to fidget with. A habit - the case for most people, I guess. Now of course I know it does not really calm me down/support me etc etc but still, I just don't know what to do with myself/my hands when I'm not holding a cigarette. 

What have you done so far? Chewing gum? Bought a fidget spinner :')?

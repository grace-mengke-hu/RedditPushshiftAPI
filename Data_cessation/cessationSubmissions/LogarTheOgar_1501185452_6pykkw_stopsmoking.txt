Cigarettes don't add anything to life... except looking really cool.

Im 28 years old and Im hung up on to the fact that I STILL think smoking is cool as fuck. It just does something for me. I like hot girls who smoke. I like a night of beer and cigarettes. I like stepping out of a building and lighting a cigarette.

Ive heard tons of people tell me that "80% (or whatever) of people will turn you down romantically just because you smoke." Yeah, that's not true. Maybe it's my choice of general company or the crowd I hang around.

I get a few days into quitting and just, I dont know, romanticize the idea of smoking. I see certain pictures of characters that smoke and I get this like "fuckin, yeah dude, that dudes cool, he dont give a fuck. I dont give a fuck."

Its this weird juvenile idea that cigarettes are cool and I cant seem to get rid of it. And it's also objectively hilarious to me when I actually take a long view of the situation. Sometimes I pull money out of my savings just to smoke cigarettes. It's like this character trait I picked and have to keep up.

I DONT KNOW MAN.

Edit: After some thought and reading all the comments, I realize a lot of this is me running away from the fact that I actually AM going to be 35 one day, and then 50, and I dont want too.

Last night was my first time drinking since I quit...

And even though the cravings were terrible, for the first time in 9 years I didn't smoke :)

I'm 24 and have been smoking since I was 15, some years a pack a day, some years a pack a week. I quit-ish too many times to count. This time I decided I was just sick of it. 9 years flew by way too fast and I'm over being a smoker! The only really bad day was day 3 when I thought I was going to have a full-blown panic attack, but I did some stretching and reading and I was finally able to sleep.

I kind of wish I was having noticeable changes already :/ but it's getting easier! Day seven cold turkey!

I smoke and want to quit. Please help.

So, long story short I am married and we both smoke. I successfully quit about 3 years ago when we attempted to quit together. My wife has a very stressful job and of course she asked me to purchase cigarettes after we both have not smoked for almost a month. I was doing great until then. Having the pack in my hand was a temptation I could not overcome. I lasted over a month but failed. I want to quit... but I do not think my wife wants to. How can I do this? This was like three years ago and I am desperate. I want to quit. I love my wife, but I am not sure how we can do this and make it work.

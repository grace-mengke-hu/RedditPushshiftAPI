Attempt 2, here we go!

Quit for about a month with Chantix over the summer. Stopped taking it and started back again.
Finished Medical Assistant schooling and now have no choice but to quit if I want to find a good career. Smoked my last cigarette on Friday morning after starting Chantix again the Friday before.

So far I haven't killed anyone-- but these cravings are getting a bit irritating.

Does this craving for cigarettes/nicotine ever go away?

Serious question. Im trying hard to quit and the cravings are killing me psychologically. My mood and concentration are also affected but that should go away. The thing is that I have very strong cravings for cigarettes and just wanted to ask anyone who has stopped for more than 100 days if it goes away. The way I see it, if Im gonna feel like this forever I would rather smoke and die soon but live a more relaxed life

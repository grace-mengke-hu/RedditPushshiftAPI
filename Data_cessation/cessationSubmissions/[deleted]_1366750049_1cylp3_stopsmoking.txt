question re: health impacts as a "light smoker"

I've recently decided to quit after having been a light smoker on and off for about 8 years. By "light smoker", I mean that when I was smoking regularly I was having between 1-3 cigarettes per day, and some days not at all. 

I have also quit for months at a time during the course of these 8 years. To provide some perspective, I started smoking occasionally when I was about 18, and I'm 26 now. I'm an otherwise healthy individual - not overweight, and I've kept in good shape by weight lifting, running, and bicycling. 

I wanted to see if anyone else (who wouldn't categorize themselves as a heavy smoker) had a similar experience regarding impacts to their health , but all opinions/perspectives are welcome. 

Like almost everybody, I turned to smoking as a means of coping with stress. I enjoyed the act of smoking, despite the fact that it made me feel pretty crappy immediately after a cigarette. 

Over the past year or so, my smoking became more regular, but still no more than 3 a day at most. But something changed. Whereas in the past I would feel kind of lousy immediately after, it used to basically go away after a brief period of time. 

But recently, my smoking has appeared to cause health problems in more lasting/noticeable ways. I'll try to summarize below:

- It seems to have triggered allergies as I started having horrible sneezing fits in the morning. This goes away when I stay away from cigarettes for a few days. 

- It's also been causing sinus/nasal congestion issues - difficulty breathing out of my nose, for example. This also goes away when I stop smoking for a couple days. 

- Grogginess/tiredness in the mornings - I've never been a morning person, but smoking seems to make it harder to get up in the morning. My head feels just plain lousy: groggy, congested, and I can't help but think that it shows in my appearance as I don't feel awake or rested. 

- Random periods of shortness of breath. This is probably the most alarming and what made me decide to quit once and for all. It struck me as strange because it didn't even occur immediately after smoking. Sometimes in bed at night I would have trouble breathing, like I wasn't taking in enough oxygen. This would also sometimes happen during the day when I wasn't even engaged in physical activity - sitting at my computer, for example.  


To give you a brief overview of where I'm at with my smoking now: I stopped cold turkey and didn't have a single cigarette for about 4 days. The past two days have been very stressful and I caved and had one cigarette each day. But the impact on my health and general sense of physical well-being is REALLY noticeable. The sinus/allergy problems, and shortness of breath, which had basically subsided, came back almost immediately.   No cigarettes so far today, and it's almost 5pm here on the east coast. 

Just looking for general perspective/thoughts, but I'd be especially interested to hear if anyone out there had a similar experience, and/or what people who would consider themselves "light smokers" have to say on the subject.

Checking in at 500 days

I'm now 500 days without a cigarette and feeling good. No real cravings any more and I can comfortably sit in a beer garden surrounded by smokers and not feel I'm missing out on anything. 
 
 Good Luck to all beginning their journey, you can do it and the good feelings outweigh the initial horrible withdrawal symptoms in the long run.

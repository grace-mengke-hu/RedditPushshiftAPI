I’m trying to quit cigarettes for good

I’ve been smoking for 17 years. I tend to not smoke very much during the week, but on the weekends I’ll smoke a pack a day while I drink. I’ve decided I need the money I spend on those things for food and I want to be healthy. 

I was thinking about getting an e-cig. Does anyone know if this is a good alternative to smoking real cigarettes? It’s pretty expensive up front but after you make that initial investment, it’s really pretty cheap to sustain. My question is if it’s healthier. Does it have the insane adverse effects tobacco has? Should I just try to go cold turkey? 

I’m also thinking of downloading a quit app. If anyone has experience with those or some kind of plan suggestion, I’m completely open. I’m sick of being sick. 

Thanks in advance.

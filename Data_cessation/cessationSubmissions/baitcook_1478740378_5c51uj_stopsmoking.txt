Scared of whats to come.

So this is my 4th day without a cigarette. All 4 days have been relatively easy. I have definitely from time to time felt like smoking, however haven't really noticed any withdrawal symptoms or serious need to smoke. I have been smoking for about 8 years now; almost a pack a day. Am I honestly past the hard part or is it just taking longer for all the nicotine to exit my system? I should add I am pretty heavy 230 at 5'5.

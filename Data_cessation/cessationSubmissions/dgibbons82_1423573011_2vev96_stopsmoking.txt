Join Me in Not Smoking Today

I just wanted to say that I love this recurring theme in the comments and the posts.  It just feels good to know that I'm surrounded by other people who aren't smoking with me today.

It's more than a mantra.  It's a true support system.  

You are all awesome.  I welcome you to join me in not smoking today.  :)

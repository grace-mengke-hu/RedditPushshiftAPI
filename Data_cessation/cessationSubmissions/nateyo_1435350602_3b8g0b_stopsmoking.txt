electronic cigarettes can be helpful!

I was addicted to cigarettes. Both for the buzz, and the ability to sit and watch youtube/play games/think in my room and smoke.  The action of smoking was nice.  I smoked for about a year and never smoked more than a half-pack a day over that period, so it's not like I was super hooked.  I got Lyme disease and decided I needed to quit smoking, my body was already going through enough.  It was hard, so I picked up a cheap electronic cigarette setup.  It didn't feel quite right, and I relapsed some.  I finally decided to invest some money into a good electronic cigarette and some 12mg juice.  It doesn't feel the same as smoking, but it helped, and it was nice to replace the action of smoking.  The cheapos you get at gas stations or head shops just aren't worth it.  I worked my nicotine all the way down to 3mg juice, and will eventually be done with smoking and vaping.  I like vaping, but I just don't want to spend the money on it, and it's not as pleasurable as smoking, although it does taste better...  Just wanted to let those of you who are struggling or not being helped by the cheap electronic cigarettes know that spending a bit more money on a good setup helps immensely with cravings and just general pleasure.

Yes, electronic cigarettes are more harmful than stopping altogether, but for those that find cold turkey difficult, electronic cigarettes were a way for me to transition more easily and enjoyably.  You'll find that you are not obsessing over not smoking when you enjoy something else.  Haven't had a craving for a cigarette in a long time, though I still think about them from time to time.  Stay strong and try whatever you need to in order to kick the cigarettes!

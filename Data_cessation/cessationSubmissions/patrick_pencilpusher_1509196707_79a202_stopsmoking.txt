if i want to get ahead i cant smoke anymore

im in for a tough life, i fucked up my schooling but never liked that shit so dont care. i want to make it with music but cant make shit when im depressed/lethargic which is exactly what smoking does to me. i need to have self discipline and sacrifice some shit.

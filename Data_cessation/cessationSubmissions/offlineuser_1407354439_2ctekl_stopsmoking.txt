Just smoked my last cigarette and I'm scared

Been smoking for about 10 years now.  I'm a firm believer in people figuring things out on their own, and as a result it is very rare for me to ask advice of anyone.  I'm not making any big announcements on social media about quitting and I'm not really telling anyone either.  It works for some people to have those close to you keep you motivated, but not me.  People telling me to quit for some reason make me want to do the exact opposite.  Alas, this is real life.

THIS, however, is r/stopsmoking, a subreddit populated by faceless androids who seem to have this whole quitting thing down to a science.  As such, I feel I am more inclined to listen to you guys (er, robots) than anyone in the real world.  

I'm scared about getting stressed at work.  I'm scared about performing (I'm a violinist) with no cigarette to calm me down beforehand.  I'm scared that I'll avoid my friends who still smoke.  I'm frightened at the idea of becoming a recluse, for the temptation will be all around me when I leave home.  But most of all, I'm scared that I'll fold like an umbrella and start smoking again.

I've tried quitting in the past to no avail, but this time I feel like I'm in a different frame of mind.  So, dear non-smokers, how do I stay strong?  What sort of hurdles can I expect to encounter?

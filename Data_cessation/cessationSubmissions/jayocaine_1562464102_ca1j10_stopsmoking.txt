5 days quit, will never smoke again (however)

I read Allan Carrs book, and it definitely resonated with me, I can confirm and say with absolute 100% certainty that I will never smoke another cigarette ever again. However, I find now that instead of smoking say for instance, while taking a break from school work, or after watch an episode of something. I just pace around and eat, I go do more homework , get up, pace around and eat, go for a run/work out, get home, sit down and watch some TV, get bored, get up pace around and eat.

Two months and some

So I decided to make the switch to electronic cigarettes on the first of the year and I've been going steady. A couple slip ups along the way but now I'm pretty offended by the smell of tobacco smoke and couldn't see myself going back (but that's how it gets you I suppose). I'm gonna slowly wean off to low-to-no nicotine over the course of the next couple months and hopefully quit for good once life settles down some more. 

In the meantime, I've been going to the gym regularly 3+ times a week, and running is now less of an effort. As soon as I quit I could only run a half a mile or less without being winded, and now I'm able to run 2+ miles on the treadmill. Slowly but surely the lungs are repairing! Signed up for my 5K coming up next week, excited to see how far I can push my healthier self. 

So maybe e-cigs work for me. I'm afraid of slipping if I don't have it with me and still get cravings, which I hope to take headon soon. However,  its a vice I can live with for now. Keep on pushing towards good things!

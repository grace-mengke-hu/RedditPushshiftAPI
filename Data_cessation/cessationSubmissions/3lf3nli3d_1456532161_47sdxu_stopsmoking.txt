2/3 withdrawal symptoms dealt with now, for the third one.

Hello, I typically notice three withdrawal symptoms when quitting nicotine. These being: 1) intense cravings up until the third to fifth'd day 2) intense headaches 3) severe deppresion

I figured out that the cravings typically means that you're hungry so during the first couple of days I eat all I can get. I also figured out how to make the headaches go away; by breathing into a plastic bag.

Now i just have to face the deppresion, which feels like puberty on acid, I would love any tips on how to make this go away which is not "think like this"

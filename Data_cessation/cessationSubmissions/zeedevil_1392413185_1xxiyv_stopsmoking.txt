Had a troubling dream that I can't get out of my head.

Three or four days ago I had a dream/nightmare that I started smoking again. At first one per day, then back to the full blown addiction. Ever since then my cravings have been...different. They're much stronger, but also make me sad somehow. I also find it strange that this dream is still bothering me. It's not normal for me to recall a dream for so long.

I'm still committed to being finished smoking, but I'm not liking these intrusive thoughts at all.

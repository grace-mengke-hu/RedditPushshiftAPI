Is their any help app that can help me to track my medical data?

I'm determine to stop myself from smoking and i'm willing to do everything. Its difficult for me since my friends are still smoking, but i'm changing myself for better and aside from that I want to start a new life. As far as I know there is some helpful app that can help me, your suggestions will be a great help.

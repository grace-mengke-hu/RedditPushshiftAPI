Resetting my badge today

After 40 days clean, I have failed my biggest challenge : spending 3 weeks of vacation with seven smoking friends...

Parties and alcool have been stronger than my non-smoking will, but I am back on track. I came back yesterday, and immediately stopped smoking.

So I'm resetting my badge today, hoping this will be the real one this time !

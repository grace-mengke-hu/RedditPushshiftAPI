Smoking as a form of procrastination

So now that I’m three weeks in, I’m not getting too many cravings, but the ones I’m still getting are right before a task I want to put off. I used to just smoke before doing something, saying that it “helped me concentrate.” I’m recognizing now, I was just using smoking as a way to procrastinate. However, a cigarette did have a definite beginning and end. So, I would have something to do, have a cigarette to put it off, but once the cigarette was done I usually got down to business. Now that I’m a non-smoker, I find it harder not to procrastinate indefinitely. Has anybody else experienced this and if so how did you deal with this? Specifically, are there any five to seven minute replacement activities I can throw in before starting a task? To be clear, I’m not worried I’m going to give into cravings or anything, just want something to help me get back to being productive.

Slipped up, but still going strong.

I stopped smoking just about a week ago.  Yesterday, I had to attend a buddy's birthday bbq.  It was a pool party, so everyone was outside and smoking.  After a few beers and shots, I asked my buddy if I could take a hit off of his E-cig/vaporizer, whatever it's called.  There is nicotine in it, but I only took a couple hits.  Then another friend asked if I wanted a cig and I couldn't turn him down.  After I finished it, I even asked for another one.

A couple hours later, I left to go home and fought the urge to buy a pack of cigs.  Didn't have an urge at all today.  

There were times where I relapsed like this in the past and used it as an excuse to just go back to my old habits, but something felt different this time.  I could hear like a voice in the back of my head saying, "You slipped up, but it's okay.  Just don't count the days and just act like you're not a smoker."

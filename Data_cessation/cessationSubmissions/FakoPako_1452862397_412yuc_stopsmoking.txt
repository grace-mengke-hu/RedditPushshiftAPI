It's Official! New Years quitters...we are in Week #3!

Week 3! Stay strong this weekend my peeps! Don't fold! We have been doing really good so far. Half a way through the month already. We are in week #3! Two full weeks without inhaling those things! We are not smokers! Someone asks you for a light? "Sorry, I don't smoke!" Feels great to be able to say that!

Stay focused this weekend. Watch out for those triggers trying to creep up. Don't be a freaking hero, ok? If alcohol is your weak spot, then don't drink this weekend. I know I am not. No sense to risk it now! We are still in that danger zone, so remember that.

I am planning on buttoning up some projects I have at the house. Need to install some wallpaper on the accent wall in my bedroom, finish installing baseboards, paint and clean up. Keeping my self busy. My gf is going to spend the weekend here this time, so we will just lay low and relax. Get the fireplace going, watch some movies. Easy peasy...

I have to say, I am really starting to notice the money difference. I have a gas station card, which I use for gas purchases (get 5 cents off a gallon). I would also use it for smokes and redbull purchases and beer. I would get my bill and pay it off. Usually, it would be $500-$600. I just paid it and it was $380! Happy about that!

I smoked 3 days ago for the first time in a month. I'm having another one now

I don't even know why. When I had the one 3 days ago it was disgusting and I couldn't even finish it...I've got a capestick and I just asked to bum a cig and I'm out in the cold by myself now... Hopefully it's just a drunken impulse

Genuine question..

Why do people start smoking cigarettes? Especially young people nowadays? 

I can understand recreational marijuana use, but cigarettes are more dangerous and can actually kill you. so many people die from the habit every year. 

If young people know this information, why do they do it still? Like if youre one of these people, im curious to hear your reason for doing it. Im not judging anyone, im just genuinely curious.

I just found out my roommate smokes and im worried about him thats all.

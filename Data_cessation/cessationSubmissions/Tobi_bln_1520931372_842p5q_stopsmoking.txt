22 days - why? how? what changed?

Hi guys! 

I‘m sharing my thoughts here cause I found reading those posts very helpful during the last days.

I quit smoking 22 ago. My dad smokes a lot and with just 52 years he looks quite old. One of my friends dad who used to smoke for quite long got cancer, another one got a heart attack. 

I am 28 now and what I know for sure, I won’t end up like these three guys. I want to stay healthy, dynamic and enjoy fresh clean air, everyday, everywhere. Of course not smoking does guarantee nothing but it’s the basis. The basis for a good life.

Since I quit a lot changed. First I felt bit isolated cause all my friends smoke. Then I started being happy and proud with my decision and also started with learning new habits like sports and way longer walks with my dog. Now just 22 days without smoking I feel way better and I am kind of used to not smoking. Even my friends smoke less and that’s another big plus.

To summarize I can just say: be strong and stop smoking immediately, it’s the best decision you can make.

Best wishes 
Tobi

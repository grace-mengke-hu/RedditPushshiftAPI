Worried about forgetting why I want(ed) to quit

The first time I quit was amazing. The day after my high school grad, I woke up and literally did not have a craving for a cigarette. I was boxing at the time, so I had something to keep me occupied. I was able to carry that out for a solid 8 months, no cravings.

One night I went out drinking and bought a pack, which didn't really matter, because again, next day no cravings. I didn't finish the pack, and then did something fucking stupid. I put it on my dresser, I told myself, as a reminder of what I beat. Again, no cravings no problem.

Then I played Mass Effect 2 on Insanity difficulty. After spending a solid 3 hours trying to beat that last Collector rush, I gave in and had a smoke; beat it on the next try.

Fast-forward like... 7 years? and I've 'quit' 6 times. Massive cravings every single time for weeks on end. I feel like I shouldn't be struggling to do this. I know some of the various triggers that make me want to smoke, I know that it is slowly killing me, and I also know that if my dad had not quit smoking, he would've died from lung complications. (Got the surgery, started back up).

I feel like despite knowing all this, I still don't have what it takes to do it on my own. Are there any really good resources out there, to impart upon me some understanding of my condition?

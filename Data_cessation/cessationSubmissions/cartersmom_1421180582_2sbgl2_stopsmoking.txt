15 years of 40 a day, day 13 of my quit and not a single craving/thought of smoking!! feeling amazing and proud

Seriously never thought it was possible that I would feel ok after quitting after being a smoker for so long and such a heavy addiction at 40+ a day
so if I can do it you can too!! I know I know it's only day 13 but today I woke up and not a single thought about a ciggie (which was my favourite of the day) 
ive not had a single craving or even thought about it at all which I also thought I would never feel this way either and yet finally it happens, I can't go back to smoking not now not ever my smoke free app tells me ive not smoked 573 ciggies since I quit!! How amazing I feel about that is ridiculous, I feel less stressed, more energetic, im sleeping easier and getting to sleep easier too, I feel proud of myself and seriously im saving a fortune!! I look at my friends (who all smoke) and think.... Glad it's no longer me!! But I don't judge or preach im just waiting for their time and I'll support them on their journey
For those just starting seriously guys I didn't think I'd ever get this far and I have so you can do this you are not alone we are here to support you stay strong and keep going xx

Almost three weeks in & attitude gone to shit - tips?

I don't know what my counter even says. I quit previously for a few years, started again, quit at the beginning of this month.

What worked last time was not drinking at first and occasionally using nicotine lozenges, so that's where I'm at again. What's changed is the level of stress in my job and the rest of my life - it's gone up.

I have been in a terrible mood for at least a week. I don't like a lot of my friends and I have very little patience for social niceties. I am controlling myself at work for the most part, but it's exhausting and then I have to be control in the rest of my life and I'm... I kind of hate people right now.

Anyone been through this? Remember this? Have tips?

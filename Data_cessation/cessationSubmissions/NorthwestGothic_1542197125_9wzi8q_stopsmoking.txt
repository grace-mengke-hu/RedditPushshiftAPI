Anyone else having really bad indigestion?

So, I’m at two weeks (woo!) and my cravings are more or less gone. But since the day I quit I’ve had complete and all consuming indigestion. I constantly feel like my guts are just about to burst, and I have this terrible lump at the bottom of my oesophagus. I wondered if anyone else had had this experience, or if this was a common trope, or if this could be unrelated?

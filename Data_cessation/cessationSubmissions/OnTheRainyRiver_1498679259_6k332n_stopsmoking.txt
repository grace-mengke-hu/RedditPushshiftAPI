Just had my last cigarette.

I just walked back into work after having my last two cigarettes. I think I realized this needed to end when when I forgot my lighter and just chained one into another.

My grandma died of lung cancer from smoking. My great uncle died of lung cancer from smoking. I saw the pain that put on my family and I don't want to hurt my children like that one day.

I've noticed that when I get ill, it's harder to shake a cough. My teeth are yellowing and my gums are whitening and receding. My tongue tastes ashen and water isn't helping much anymore. Additionally, I think the recent boom in my cigarette habit is hampering my sexual performance, which is frustrating and embarrassing in it's own way.

I'm visiting my girlfriend and her family across the country for a precious few days--thankfully, far away from the triggers I've developed here. I've got one pack of nicorette as a hedge against nausea and headaches so I don't end up vomiting in her parents' toilet.

I'm only 20 and I can't let this become a lifelong habit. I've tried to quit before, but not with a plan or a community like this. I'm dedicated now and I WILL be disciplined.

Wish me luck, everyone.

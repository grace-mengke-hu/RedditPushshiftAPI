Quitting before it's too late?

Hello everyone! 
I had my first cigarette my freshman year of college. It started out with some of my peers offering me a cig after partying with them. I stopped for a while my sophomore year of college. I'm currently now a junior and I started smoking again. I find myself craving a quick cigarette when I come back from classes and honestly it's really making me sad. Do you have any advice on how I should prevent myself from smoking any further? Thank you so much for the support!

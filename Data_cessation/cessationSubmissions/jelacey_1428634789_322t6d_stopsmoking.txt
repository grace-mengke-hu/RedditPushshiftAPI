Went cold turkey, quit weed too. Girlfriend and I split. I honestly don't even want to tackle another day but by some miracle I havnt smoked a single one.

EDIT: 

Thank you, everyone! On to the next day! I couldn't of done it without ya'll...

Edit 2: I want to gild everyone and probably will honestly have the money now that I've quit both !

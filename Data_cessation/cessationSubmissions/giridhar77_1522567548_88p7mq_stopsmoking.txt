After 9 years of being a heavy smoker, I always smoked more than my smoker friends. And always had the reputation of being worst among them. Now I fight the occasional pangs and even fight them off even in my dreams and doesnâ€™t smoke. But had come a long long way. Nobody believed that I can do it.

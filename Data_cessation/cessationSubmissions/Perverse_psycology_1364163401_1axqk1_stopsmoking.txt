Here we go. Day 1, I have had it with smoking.

I want to live to see the world in 60 years. I want to see where Science takes Medicines and watch as humanity develops space travel and tourism. I want to see Humans set foot on another planet. I feel that I will not witness these things if I continue with this habit. So here we go. No more Cigarettes.

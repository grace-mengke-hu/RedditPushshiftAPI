I was going to stop on new years, now I actually have a reason to stop.

I've got letters of recommendation for a boob job, and insurance will cover it. All I need is to be tobacco free.

Ive been on a pack a week for a while. I ran out last night, fingers crossed. Getting home from work will be the hardest. I'm so used to smoking spliffs because straight green makes me cough up a storm, but I'll manage. Doubt I can handle a green joint, but I've got pipes and a dry herb vape in my shopping cart

Finally, some real incentive!

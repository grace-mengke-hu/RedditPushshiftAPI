Smoking as part of self harm?

Hey, one of my first posts on here.

I'm a pretty anxious and depressive person. What a surprise. I used to self harm, never anything too bad but I felt like it got rid of some of the anxiety, like I was punishing away some of the anxiety I felt, and there was something good about controlling the process of injuring myself and healing. 

I've been smoking 3 years, heavily for 2, though I went from a pack a day last year to about pack every two days this year, three or so for the past month. 

I'm getting really stressed about finals, and when I want to hurt myself I go out for a smoke, but I'm starting to see the long term crap that's affecting me from smoking, my teeth and my skin etc, and I'm not even keeping weight off anymore.

Does anyone else have experiences like this? Where you use smoking to kind of keep you from doing something worse? I guess... I guess I'm just checking I'm not crazy. And I'm working up to quitting when I go home after graduation and I guess I wonder if anyone else has strategies to help with that crutch.

Thanks in advance.

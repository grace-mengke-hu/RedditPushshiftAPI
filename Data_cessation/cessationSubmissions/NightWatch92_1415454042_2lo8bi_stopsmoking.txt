Wasn't ready to go out

Went out for a friends birthday even though I had stopped drinking and smoking despite saying to myself I wasn't going to go the day before but I felt I should. Had 2 beers and was on my 3rd cigarette, when one of my friends came to take it off me. I went home shortly after to think about what I'd done. Back on Day One but it shook me a bit after being so resolute on quitting.

Common withdrawal symptoms?

My sinuses have been killing me for about 3 days now. The top of my brow right above my nose has so much pressure that it makes me dizzy. I breathe fine and I don't have a stuffy or drippy nose. I smoked for 10 years at about 5/6 per day average. I'm using the patch but I stopped 2 days ago because I got one that was too high in mg. Has anyone else gotten sinus pain right after quitting?

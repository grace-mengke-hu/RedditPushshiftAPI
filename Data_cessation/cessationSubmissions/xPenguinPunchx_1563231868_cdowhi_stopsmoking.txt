2 month weakness. Terrible depression

Iâ€™m at 2 months now and I came very close to buying a pack . I have depression that I know wonâ€™t be solved by smoking but I know quitting is what worsened it. I used to be able to control my emotions . Id have a cigarette when I felt low and for whatever reason it picked me up and strengthened me . Now I canâ€™t get ahold of myself and I donâ€™t know how to cope anymore . 

Before quitting Iâ€™d feel low moods briefly and move on. These last two months I feel a negative thought and Iâ€™m stuck in it for hours and days . My mind is rationalizing cigarettes in a self harm kind of way. â€œYouâ€™re sad as hell all the time, why are you trying to prolong your life anyways , you might as well smoke and be miserable than not smoke and be miserable for longer â€œ 

Has anyone felt this for as long as me? did you ever get out of that slump? I know the happy me is still inside me and I know I donâ€™t want to be a smoker . A week ago I had no cravings for days at a time and felt really good. Now I feel like I did when I first quit. I guess Iâ€™m just looking for some words of encouragement. This group is the only thing thatâ€™s kept me away from slipping and Iâ€™m really grateful for it ðŸ’•

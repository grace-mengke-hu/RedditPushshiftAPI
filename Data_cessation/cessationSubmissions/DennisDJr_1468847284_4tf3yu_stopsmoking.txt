Day Number #1 of quitting

Smoked my last cigarette last night around 11:00pm and put my first patch on first thing this morning. I am ready to quit, but I am nervous because of how much of a hold these buggers have on me! 

Any tips on what to do when you are used to taking multiple smoke breaks at work?

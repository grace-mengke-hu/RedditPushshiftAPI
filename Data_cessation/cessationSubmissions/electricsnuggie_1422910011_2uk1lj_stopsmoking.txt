Try this one weird trick!

5 days! This is the easiest time I've ever had in 8 years of smoking. Funny story: I bought a pack on my last day. Disgusted with myself, I went to the roof to ceremoniously throw it away, all dramatic like. But then I had an idea: I threw it onto my neighbor's roof, a place that I can access, but not without getting grimy and cut up. Throwing a pack away is a symbolic barrier, because I can always go buy another one. Would I climb across a disgusting roof and injure myself to smoke a cigarette? No! How demeaning! Is paying a company $7 to ruin my life and kill me any less demeaning? Well, hadn't thought of it that way before. It's working so far!

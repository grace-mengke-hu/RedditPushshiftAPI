Nicotine lozenges

Yo!  Been using nicotine lozenges for quite a few years now. I’m down to about 12 1mg lozenges a day. I think it’s time to quit. Has anyone else gone through this?  Any tips?  I’m a runner so I don’t want to vape or anything (I’ve done it in the past and felt it affected my runs). 

Thanks!

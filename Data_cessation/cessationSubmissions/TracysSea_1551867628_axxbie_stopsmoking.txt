Yeehaw! Twenty-four smokefree hours behind me, and I'm already breathing better.

I really do already feel better, but I was to the point that I was starting to wheeze. I'm 58, so I got a lot butts behind me. :D

It's deadly serious because I watched my mom die of COPD and my dad of lung cancer.

I'm using patches, and even slept in my patch because I hate waking up in withdrawal. I'm also letting myself eat whatever sounds good, for now anyway.

So right now my protocol is: Stay up half the night eating junk food, and Just don't smoke.

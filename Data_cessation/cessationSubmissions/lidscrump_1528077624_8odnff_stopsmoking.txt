When did you feel like you were really a non-smoker?

I’m at almost a year (June 27th!). I was smoking for 15 years, a pack a day for the last 5. I still miss cigarettes most days. I appreciate that I’ve saved money and that I don’t smell bad, but it still feels like I miss the best friend I’ve ever had. It’s... pathetic, I know! 

So I’m asking: do you remember the moment you finally felt like you weren’t a smoker anymore?

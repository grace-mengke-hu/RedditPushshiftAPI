How have you tricked yourself into relapsing? What was the "excuse"?

A post I just read got me thinking about the mind games we play on ourselves to justify putting off our quit, having one cigarette, being near cigarettes when we're not ready, etc ...
I'd love to hear some of these thought processes so I can look out for them.. It just amazes me how contrived they can get, and how sneaky these mind games are at times.

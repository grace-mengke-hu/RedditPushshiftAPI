On which side of the fence you are?

Hello, IÂ´m here to remember a post that changed the way I used to treat my addict. 

"Believe me, it's much much better wishing you could have a smoke while being on this side of the fence than wishing you could free yourself from the slavery while enjoying a cigarette. So if you're early in your quit and things seem pretty rough right now, just trust me and power through it, things get better and you finally get to be your true normal self again. It's a beautiful feeling."

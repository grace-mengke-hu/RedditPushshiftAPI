Trying to quit tomorrow. No if's and's or butts.

I'm a 23 year old female, I started smoking cigarettes when I was the ripe age of 16. I went from one bad habit to another, from self harm (cutting) to smoking. Which is better, right? 

Wrong.

It's a habit. It's doing more worse than good. It hurts me in many ways my past habit did, without the blood or scars.

But after trying to deal with my bf of 4 years being a stoner and a dealer of pot, who is trying to quit cigarettes but not pot; I want to show him that I want him to quit smoking pot by example. By showing him that I can quit smoking cigarettes. 

I smoke easily a pack or more each and every day. Both of my parents (whom I live with still) smoke constantly. I can't move out just yet, I don't have the funds. 

But after going on reddit and looking at both this subreddit, and the one for those quitting pot, I've decided that this is for the best possible person I can become.

I have a vape/e-cig too. But the juice I have for it is a very small amount of nicotine. (6mg) My best friend (who didn't smoke for half as long as I have) quit smoking cigarettes with it. And that's how my bf is doing it. I hope to be at 0mg by the end of the year.

tl;dr I'm quitting tomorrow. Done. Nope. Vape -in-hand, I hope that tomorrow will be the last day of me smoking. I can always come here for support, right? 

Thanks. -Tentai

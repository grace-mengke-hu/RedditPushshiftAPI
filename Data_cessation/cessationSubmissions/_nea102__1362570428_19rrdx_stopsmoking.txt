I stopped smoking and haven't been healthy since!

Let me preface this by saying that I'm well aware that despite having felt ill for over 2 months, my body will repairing the damage caused by smoking. I just want to see if anyone else has suffered the same as I have!

I started smoking at 14 and my consumption varied from 5 smokes a day to two packs a day. When I quit I was on about 8 a day, 15 years after I originally started.

In the first week I had to go to hospital as I had my first asthma attack in over 2 years. I was diagnosed with a chest infection and given a course of erythromycin. It didn't clear up at all so I was given another course of them and some steroids (prednisolone).

That still hasn't cleared it up and I've also had 3 colds on the bounce. Chest xrays have shown nothing and I'm on yet *another* course of erythromycin.

Anyone else had anything like this? My doctor says sometimes people go through this when they quit.

Beginning of the Kanji-lady

After a month long relapse i am ready to quit smoking again. I have tried Alan Car, vaping, gum and cold turkey before but nothing has stuck. I can go many days and feel like i am free, but then start again as soon as a reach a preset goal like a month, tree months or a week. This time i will take some inspiration from the Pok√©mon guy and do something not smoking related that will show me my progress. I have always wanted to learn Japanese, and therefore i am going to write one kanji every day i stay smoke free.  Since there are 2,136 Kanji to learn so i don't fear i will still be an addict when i am done. 


I will post an update every week to keep myself accountable. To work on my english aswell as Japanese. To get back my self-esteem and to hopefully become an inspiration in the far future.

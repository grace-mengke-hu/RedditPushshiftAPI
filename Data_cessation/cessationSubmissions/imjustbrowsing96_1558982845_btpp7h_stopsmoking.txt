Starting all over again 4 years later.

I quit when I found I was pregnancy with my almost 5 year old, after nursing for a year I started smoking again. So I'm quitting all over again. 

I've smoked 2 cigarettes since yesterday, it's mainly the almost anger feelings I get when I go way too long without a cigarette. I slowly cut myself down, being slightly more mindful of smoking the past week (not smoking back to back or mindlessly doing it just because) to hopefully curb the cravings. Which I feel have worked. It's just the antsy, frustrated, I'm going to pull my hair out feeling I get after so long of pushing the cravings down that keep getting me to get just half of another one. 

Has anyone had this happen? I havent read anyone being so angry feeling while quitting?

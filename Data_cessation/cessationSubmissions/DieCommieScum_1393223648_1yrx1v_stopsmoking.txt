saw this sub mentioned on askreddit, here's how I quit. Over a year without

I quit by not smoking pieces at a time, just cutting it out at times of my day/life. Each step made the next easier. The hardest was after coffee, the longest was during drinking (basically until I discovered eCigs... smoking and drinking is heaven on earth... until the next morning. With lowered inhibitions, it's a bitch)

I haven't had a real tobacco product in over a year, I have a drag of a v2 ecig maybe 3 times every few months when i'm really hammered.

Basic order of cut-downs:

1) no smoking in the car

2) no smoking after coffee

3) no smoke break at x:xx am

4) no smoke break at x:xx pm

5) no bringing smokes out of the house, unless going drinking at party etc.

6) only smoke when drinking, period.

7) ecigs only

8) occasional ecig drag rather than committing to whole regular cig

9) desire eventually leaves as ecigs are less addictive and drags vs having whole cigs

As an intermediary step, I quit buying commercial cigs and rolled my own for a few years for costs savings and to make it more work. Works out to under $2 a pack, while being much tastier and cleaner from a chemical perspective.

IMO, it's more realistic to accept moments of weakness and work on them one at a time than cold-turkey or expensive medical methods not tailored to you specifically.

This worked for me as someone who genuinely enjoyed it, YMMV but I think it addresses a lot of common issues. I'm happy to answer Q's.

1 week update

So things have been going as expected, what with this being my nth time quitting. But I'm going strong this time.

Initially I substituted with tic tacs (not a good idea to substitute, I know) but those only lasted 2 days and I didn't buy another after. It's going well. I'm still at the stage where I'm constantly having to put it away from my mind. 

Last night the first smoking dream hit me. I felt so guilty for giving in to it again. When I woke up I was so relieved to know it was just a dream and I hadn't broken my streak.

Stay alert, everyone! Nicotine will do anything and everything to trick you back into the habit! I'll update again next week.

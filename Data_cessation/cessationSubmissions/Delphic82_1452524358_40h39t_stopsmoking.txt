First year down!

Hi guys, I was a new year's quitter last year, slipped within the first week, but kept with it, now I'm past the one year mark!  If you slip, don't give up, it will get hard at times, but it will pass.  Even 2 days before my 1 year mark, I had a dream I smoked, and I remember thinking 'Ugh, I was so close to making it a whole year...'  It was really relieving when I woke up and realized it was a dream!  Stick with it, you can do it!

One Year!

As a "happy smoker" (or so I thought) for over 30 years, I finally quit cold turkey after reading Alan Carr's Easy Way, and just deciding enough was enough.  I rarely think about it anymore.  But realized that Father's Day is coming up, and I stopped the Monday after Father's Day last year.  I looked today, and I am on 365 days!  Believe me, if I can do it, so can you.

Struggling with depression and smoking is my only way to deal with it..

I started smoking 18 months ago when I really started feeling the pressure of my studies and I got hooked.. I have tried multiple times to stop, throwing away all the tobacco I had, but ended up buying some more. 
But the past year has been very difficult and I have been depressed for so long, avoiding human contact, avoiding my girlfriend, skipping god knows how many classes, which has made trying to quit incredibly hard. 
I just tried going to sleep without smoking, but my heart was beating very fast, and I succumbed to the pressure. Smoking is my only way to cope with the pain, but I know it's only hurting me and I really want to quit.
I just discovered this sub, and it's nice to see positive people who have now stopped smoking for years, or even for a few days. I hope you hear my plea and any advice or even the smallest encouragements are appreciated.

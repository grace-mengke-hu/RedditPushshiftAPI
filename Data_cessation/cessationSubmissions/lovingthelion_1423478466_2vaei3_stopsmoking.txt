First day quitting (ever!), first craving (beat!)

So hey all, joining you here for the first time. 22, been smoking for around four years and earlier this afternoon I smoked the last cigarette in the package and decided it was going to be my last ever.

Most of the day went pretty okay, most difficult part was after dinner - post meal cigarettes were always my weakness - part of the reason I was previously wary about quitting actually was that without a cig after dinner or lunch or breakfast, I tend to just keep eating until I'm stuffed

But tonight I sat through maybe a minute of craving, and then (please don't laugh at me), put on Taylor Swift and danced like a demon for twenty minutes. Finished, craving vanished. Apparently nicotine doesn't like Shake It Off.

Hopefully I'll stick round.

100 days ago today...

I smoked my last cigarette atop a rocky cliff at Unawatuna beach in Sri Lanka.  I remember the exact moment.  I was anxious and nervous, but it has been an incredible journey so far.  I honestly don't think I could have done it without reading Allen Carr's Easy Way to Quit Smoking.  I was a pack a day smoker or more.  So, if you are still trying to quit, and if you haven't read the book, please do! Thanks for all the support here.  Here's to another 100!

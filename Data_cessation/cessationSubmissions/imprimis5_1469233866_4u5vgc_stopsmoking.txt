The anniversary I almost forgot

Apparently it's been a month since I quit smoking. I wouldn't even have realised it if my personal trainer hadn't asked what day I was on.

I still feel like I could literally fuck this up at any moment. But it's dull and in the background now, not sharp and the main thought on my mind. Historically, this is when I get overconfident, let my guard down, and start all over again. Not this time!

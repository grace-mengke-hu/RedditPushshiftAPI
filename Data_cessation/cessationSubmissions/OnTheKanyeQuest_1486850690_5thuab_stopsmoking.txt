Day 1.... Any Suggestions?

Today is the first day I am quitting smoking. I went to the club last night and smoked two packs of ciggarettes with my friends. Woke-up today hung over and smoked a spare i had in the ash tray and it was disguisting. My lungs were already wheezy from all the smoking last night, but that cigarette did a number on me. They. are. nasty. 

I've been using nicotine for 3 years now and started smoking ciggarettes on the regular a little more than a year and a half ago. I've tried quitting multiple times but i always find myself buying another pack or a black and mild. 

Any suggestions to help get me through this first month? When can I expect this to get better? Will i ever be able to just drink again without smoking? Should i start vaping again or just quit nicotine all together cold turkey?

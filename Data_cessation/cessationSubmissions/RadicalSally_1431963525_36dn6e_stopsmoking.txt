Things I've noticed over the past 15 days

I quit 16 days ago, deciding after my last cigarette at a party that I wouldn't buy another pack. I still vape sometimes, but that's it. And even the vaping is tapering down. I reinstalled the Quit Now app (which I already had purchased the pro version of last time I tried to quit) mostly to keep track of how many cigarettes I *haven't* smoked and how much money I've saved.

There have been some things I've noticed that I didn't expect or didn't realize were such huge issues while I was smoking.

- I can smell *everything*. Dear god, it's terrible. I never realized how bad my house had gotten. I never smoked inside, but I have roommates and the stale smell of our house is horrid. We have animals too, they smell worse than I realized. I can't believe I invited people into my home. It's mortifying. On the plus side, when I'm outside I can smell all the flowers blooming, which is really rather nice. And I personally smell better, of course.
- Over this weekend I realized how long it had been since I was able to laugh from a relaxed position. For the past year whenever I would laugh while laying down or leaned back on a sofa I'd start coughing. That doesn't happen any more. Laughing doesn't hurt. It had become so normal I forgot that laughing isn't supposed to hurt or make you cough.
- Spicy food is actually becoming spicy again. I can tell if something is going to give me heart burn before I overeat whatever it is. I'm excited to start getting more of my sense of taste back. I love food and it feels like I'm getting to try old beloved favorites all over again. 

I've never been so content while trying to quit before. This is the first time I've really felt like quitting is going to stick, that I'm absolutely not going to start again. It helps that most of my friends have either completely quit or totally switched to vaping, so even if I desire a smoke there isn't anyone to bum from. I've had to avoid going to the bar for trivia for the past couple weeks, but I think next week I'll be ready to try it. See if I can really resist. There's that one guy in my friend group who actively tries to get other people to smoke with him, hopefully he will take the hint and lay off.

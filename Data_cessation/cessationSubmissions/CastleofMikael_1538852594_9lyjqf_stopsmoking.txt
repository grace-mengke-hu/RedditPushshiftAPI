Tips for stop smoking?

A couple of weeks ago I stopped receiving help with my economy, which meant I couldn't afford paying for cigarettes. I stopped for four days, and it wasn't that hard at all. I did what my brother told me to when he stopped, focusing intensively with something that you love. For me, it's castles, their history, architectures, everything. But, my parents bought me cigarettes, because they thought it was hard for me. I couldn't say no, because I'm very bad at saying that, which made me smoke again, and now they are buying cigarettes for me, which I hate. Will tell them to stop next time.

But now, when I threw the cigaretts away, it felt very hard. I cannot afford buying chewing gum, spray or anything, which makes it harder for me. What I'm asking is if anyone can give me some inexpensive tips for stopping?

My taste is finally back to normal! And improved! :D

So, I had been having troubles for a long time, with taste of some foods. Specifically my spaghetti bolognese that I have a couple of times a week. For the first few weeks I couldn't enjoy it at all, it really tasted rotten.

But slowly it improved and now today finally I realised it tastes completely normal, and even more delicious than when I smoked!

So yay for that!

Keep up the good fight folks, you can do it! And things will taste SO much better when they do.

Today is the Day

I'm quiting today. I said my good byes to cigarettes last night. I've discarded all of my "goods" and things that may trigger me. I'm ready to regain control of my life and my health. Just wanted to have this message as a time stamp for the future. I look forward to joining the ranks of people who are strong enough to quit. Check back with you all in a month! 

24/M ( probably won't be changing that within a month haha ) 

Exercise: haven't gone to the gym 3 weeks 

Stress levels: moderately high, part of the reason I smoked so much was school and work, which are currently causing some stress. 

Random note: I have a lump near my right lymph node, it gets irritated when I smoke. ( Hope it's nothing too serious.. ) 

Bank account: pretty much non-existent haha

Edit: I wanted to give a status on my life so we can all see what changes about it.

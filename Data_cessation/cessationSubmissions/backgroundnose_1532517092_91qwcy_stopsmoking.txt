Any support and advice welcome!

Quit drinking ( again) on June 8th but I let myself smoke up til last night). Typical "last hurrah " mentality meant I smoked about 7/8 cigarettes yesterday. I wasn't even enjoying the last ones. Just wanted to finish the pack. Today my lungs felt super messed up, my throat and tongue felt burnt and my lips were super dry. Bonus : I had a nightmare that my teeth were all messed up from smoking.

So far, today has been ok. I had one or two cravings earlier but I replaced them with the thought of a healthy non-alcoholic drink. For me drinking and smoking has always gone hand in hand, and the irony is that I'm not even  physically addicted to cigarettes!

Anyway, my appointment with the dentist fell through because I was too busy ( crazy moving mission today) and so I've scheduled another appointment for next Wednesday. I'm determined to quit though before I go home again as I shows on my lips (I've got dark skin so it stains my lips) and I'm anticipating a stressful visit and don't want to be craving a cigarette when I'm there.

I stopped for 3.5 months earlier this year(along with drinking) and it was going so well until I had a breakdown over an assignment deadline. So I do know I can do it... it's just a matter of drumming up the willpower again.

Wish me luck everyone! I feel a supportive community is what has been missing on my last few attempts to stop.

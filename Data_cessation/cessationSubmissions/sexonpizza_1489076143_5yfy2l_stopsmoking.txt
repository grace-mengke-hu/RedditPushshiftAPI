Quitting nicotine has been amazing

It was tough at first... I felt like a psycho crazy chick. But now its amazing. I only get cravings every once in a while at weird random times.  I can acknowledge it and move on. I don't have to excuse myself from discussion to go stink myself up. Or feel embarrassed to chance asking if I can vape somewhere or just assuming to go outside. Along with quitting nicotine I mostly quit drinking (I've had one or two here and there but not like...  complete night out) and I'm enjoying the not wasting money. To think I've been literally setting all this money on fire really embarrasses me. My moods are better cause I'm not constantly 'jonsing' or whatever or worried when the next time I'm going to get my fix is. Overall, I'm proud of myself and cannot believe the quality of life I've been missing all these years. Gawd I feel like an idiot for not doing this sooner..  And starting in the first place. I finally feel... free.. as stupid as that sounds.

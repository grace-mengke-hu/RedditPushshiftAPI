Quit smoking and started chewing Nic gum. I highly recommend it.

This stuff is awesome. Doesnt give me a buzz just relieves the nagging ,but that's not the best part. It makes me gag, choke, and on 1 occasion throw  up . It's honestly the worst. It's only been like 2 weeks but I'm already chewing only 1 every other day just because the nagging is so not worth the sensations the gum does to my mouth. When I walk by and see someone smoking a cigarette the abstract thought of a cigarette is still very appleaing but the smell itself is starting to make me nauseous. It's like the pavlov did with those dogs but the opposite. I might start putting hot sauce or pepper on my gum just to really drive the point home.

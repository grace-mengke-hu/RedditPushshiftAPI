A lurker checking in to humble brag-107 days nicotine-free!!!

52 year old 30 pack/year EX smoker here. Not any lightweight filtered nonsense either. Camel straights, Luckies, Drum rollies. 
Reading your posts was very helpful. 
I absolutely could not have done it without my wife quitting alongside me. I'm here to tell all of you that You Can Do It! 
The first two weeks are tough, but if you think of it like an act of omission rather than commission it might seem easier? 
Cravings last no more than two minutes! Anybody can get through that!  
What is astounding is that I'm still coughing up nasty looking stuff every morning. Is that normal?

Expelling muck after 7 months

Hi guys, I wanted to know if someone ever had the experience of having crazy cough and expelling muck after stopping for 6+ months? I know that the body goes through some cleaning stuff, but it seemed to me a bit interesting. Thanks for any advice or comment. Stay strong!

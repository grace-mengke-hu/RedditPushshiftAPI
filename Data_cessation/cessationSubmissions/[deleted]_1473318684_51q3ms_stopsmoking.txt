Any tips for staying quit?

Hey gang...

As the title says, any tips for staying quit? Thanks in advance.

Been trying to quit, but I keep going back to the shop to buy more. I quit, feel better, but then just can't keep quit. I tried EasyWay, with some success. It certainly has helped break down some of the mental barriers. I feel good quit, then I start imagining people smoking, then I start to give in, and finally make the trek to buy more. I really want to quit for good, it just seems so difficult right now. 

I've been smoking on and off for 10 years. Mainly on. My first quit I lasted a year and a half. Said to myself I'd never smoke again unless something really bad happened...Well it did and I smoked. Used EasyWay, was mainly off them. Then this past year I've been smoking all the time. Can't believe it's been a year. Ugh!

Day 5 here, a little confused, with a few questions for the double digit people here!

So, i was a pack a day smoker for almost 12 years, im a 33 yr old male, on the 5th day of a cold turkey quit! 

So far, i feel great. By the morning of day 2 i was super proud of NOT SMOKING FOR A WHOLE DAY. By day 3 i woke up feeling fresh and breathing better, and what's that smell? Oh it's the soap on my skin after my shower, did not know i could smell that. 

So all is going well, however, on the mornings of day 4 and day 5 (today), I've woken up feeling super groggy, blocked up and with a bit of a headache. Super dry throat and i feel  almost like I'm getting a cold.

Is this normal? The quit app i use doesn't really mention any of this.


Any advice/comments on how long i could expect this, any tips (I'm not drinking, being diet concerned, and starting to walk/run in the evening) wiuld be great! 
Well done to everyone here, I'm SO glad you guys and this sub are out there!!! 


EDIT: ignore my badge, the bot doesn't seem to be adjusting it for me yet. I'm on day 5.

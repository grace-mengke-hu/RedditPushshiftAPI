Despite my cravings...

I am so happy with the way that my apartment smells.  It has been warmer weather and I have been able to keep the windows open during the day and I am so happy with the way both my apartment and  smell, no longer like stale cigarettes. Just thought I would share some of my random thoughts as I sit here ready to head out to run some errands.

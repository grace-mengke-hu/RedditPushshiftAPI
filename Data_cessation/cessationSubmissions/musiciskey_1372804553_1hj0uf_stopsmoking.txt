Hit a rough patch....

Seriously,  I think about having a smoke too often. I get stressed or argue with my girlfriend and I want a fucking cigarette.  I feel like I don't know how to manage my stress and anger without cigarettes.  Its absolutely maddening.  I don't want to smoke but hell if I know what else to do. I could use some insight.  A piece of wisdom to improve this mindstate.

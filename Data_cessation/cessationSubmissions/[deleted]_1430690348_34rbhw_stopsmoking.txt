Please someone I need HELP!

I have been smoking for 10 years now, I recently got married and my wife HATES me smoking and won't allow it. Every time I get drunk I seem to always smoke. Can someone please offer me some helpful advice as to how I could stop. I love my girl so much and don't want to lose her thank you so much.

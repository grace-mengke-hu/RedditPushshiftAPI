WOO HOO 2 Weeks Today!!!!

Never thought I would be able to say that!!! Made it 2 weeks no smokes, and that was through a 2 hour dentist visit, and a tooth extraction that will happen today, no excuses this time about nerves or anxious NO MORE SMOKES, that is the only thing I keep telling myself!! 

Did have another dream last night, my subconscious telling me I could reward myself with a smoke, I have been doing so good, what will one smoke do to me!!! My brain is an evil thing right now!!!

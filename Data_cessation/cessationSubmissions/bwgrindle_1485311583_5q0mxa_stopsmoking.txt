1 year today

Today I officially have gone 1 year without a cigarette.  In fact, I have not had any nicotine or smoking cessation product.  

I cannot say how relieved I am. To all those who are trying to start the whole journey to being a nonsmoker I have a few things to say.

The good stuff first:
My life is better in so many ways. I have recovered my senses of smell and taste. I don't smell bad anymore.  I don't feel set apart at work and with family and friends.  I have more money.  I feel healthier. My relationship with my family has improved tremendously.  I don't feel that I have to isolate myself. I don't have to lie anymore to smoke. There are no more excuses to smoke. I'm calmer and more controlled.  I can manage stress better.  

The bad: Quitting sucks. I was miserable for the first few months.  It did get better but in all honesty I still miss it in a small way.  It was a part of my life for so long I can't help but to notice that it's gone.  That's the insidiousness of addiction. It may always be a tiny part of my psyche but I know I can overcome it. 

Bottom line, there are so many benefits of quitting. If you don't quit you are truly missing out on life (and hopefully have more of it).  

Please, if anyone on this sub needs to talk send me a message.  Talking helps without a doubt.  

Be strong.  You have it in you to do it.

Roughly three weeks in

Haven't been keeping track of the number of days. I know am getting close to a month. I have a history of smoking with "long breaks." I don't want to pick up another smoke ever again, I still feel dizzy when I work out, which always seems to be the tipping point that makes me want to quit. 

I know different things work for different people. I see a lot of people posting X days / months without a smoke. Does it help to have a mindset like that? I feel like thinking of it that way could lead me to obsess over it even more. What are your thoughts?

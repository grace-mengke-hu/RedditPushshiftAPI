my turn! I'M DOING IT!

basically pack/day smoker since i was 21. decided this year for my birthday my gift to myself would be to quit smoking. 10 years is a good even number to have smoked and i'm done. 

woke up the day after my bday and was ready to say fuck it already. couldn't resist my morning cig. smoked maybe 2 puffs, was hungover and gross feeling, put it right out and said "i really don't want this."

i'm on day 3 now and anytime i think about a cig i think of how TRULY i really don't want this and how gross cigs are. my skin is already clearer, can breathe deeper, and i know that this is the time it's going to stick. 

tbh, kinda just vegged out in front of netflix for the first day. still sitting outside here and there. blowing bubbles for my puppy to chase, eating frozen veggies, holding and sucking a non-lit cig. 

i'm using the app and reading this sub frequently, so thanks for all your posts! can't wait for my life to start FRESH! if you're considering quitting, try it for only two days just to smell the morning. man, it's incredible.

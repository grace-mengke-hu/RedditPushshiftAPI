Been a smoker of tobacco and tobacco/cannabis joints since I was 14, I'm now 43. My wife, also a smoker has had to give up as we discovered she was smoking for two. This is my first attempt at giving up.

 I'm joining her in solidarity.  My wife is now nearly four months pregnant and has been off them since we found out she was pregnant.  I said I would always give up if she became pregnant, I put it off for a while but bit the bullet 4 days ago.

I'm the lucky one as my wife decided to go cold turkey, I'm on the nicotine patches and inhaler.  I having a few beers tonight and am finding it particularly difficult, but I think I might be ok.

The patches are a great help.  I'm finding that they are managing to help keep the cravings at bay.  Any time I do feel the urge a puff of the Nicorette inhaler seems to give me a bit of instance relief.

What are the biggest issues you face when quitting smoking?

I recently posted this: http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/2cyvv5/does_seeing_how_much_smoking_cost_you_motivate/

I wanted to know if cost was a motivating factor to quit smoking, its seems it might be but not enough to be a sole driver. 

For those of you who haven't read the other page, I am a designer who is trying to build an app to assist smokers who wish to stop smoking.

My new question is: What are the biggest issues you face when quitting smoking? (and if you use any apps currently and have found them helpful, any info would be appreciated)

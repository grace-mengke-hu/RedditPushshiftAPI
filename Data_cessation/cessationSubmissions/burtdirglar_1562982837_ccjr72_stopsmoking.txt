Day by day

I have been an on and off smoker for years and never a heavy one, maybe 5 cigarettes a day. I want to quit for good. I promised a family member with a smoking related health issue that I would quit for good with him. This time around kinda sucks. When I was smoking, I only did it at home and that meant I went ALL day at work without smoking and for some reason the work day has brought some of my worst cravings. Iâ€™ve started taking 5 minute walks, playing games, NRT and using gummy candy. I will win!

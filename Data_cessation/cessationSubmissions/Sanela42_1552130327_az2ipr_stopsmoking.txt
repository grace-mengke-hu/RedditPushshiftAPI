Day 13

Hiya,
I use to smoke around 50-55 cigarettes a day for more then 20 years and very happy to say today is day 13 since I have stopped without any help ... 
decided to go cold turkey as I am very addictive by nature and didn’t want to get hooked on anything else ...
Fist 3/4 days wore really hard and nights wore very long but it’s getting better I could feel it ... and am sure I have a long way to go but I believe I can do it !

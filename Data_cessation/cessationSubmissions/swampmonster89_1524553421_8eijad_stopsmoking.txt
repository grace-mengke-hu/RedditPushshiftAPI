Does anyone else have anxiety?

Hey guys, just recently have been trying to quit smoking but my anxiety SKY ROCKETS. The first 24 hours im fine, but 2 days in (the last 3 times I tried to quit) my whole body feels like, tingly???? And my head feels weird and foggy and the anxiety is unbearable. If anyone else has experienced this, how long does it last? I'm thinking maybe quitting on a Thursday so the worst anxiety will hit me over the weekend. I can't go to work (very physical job) feeling like this. I know I'm gonna have to tough it out eventually but roughly how long :( thanks for this sub, you are all inspirations!!!

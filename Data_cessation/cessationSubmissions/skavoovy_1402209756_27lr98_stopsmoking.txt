Former analog smoker years ago, recently picked up e cigarettes habit. Can anyone compare the difficulty of quitting analog to quitting electronics?

I haven't been doing it too long, but I regret picking back up just from the standpoint of having a dependency.  Anyone who has kicked the e-smoke habit:  Is it as hard to do as regulars?

Need some advice, hoping someone on here has been in a similar situation.

First off, ignore my badge if it's still there, from the last time I seriously tried to quit. So i've spent the last year basically hating every minute I'm smoking, there are a million reasons why I don't want to do it anymore. The biggest issue though, is my job. I work in a customer service role, basically my job is to be nice to people who are pissed off at me all day, and quitting smoking has made this an incredibly difficult thing to deal with. Money is incredibly tight so i can't really afford to take time off work to quit right now, even though it would save me money in the long run, so i'm wondering if anyone else dealt with something similar to this when you quit, and what got you through it. Any and all help would be really appreciated.

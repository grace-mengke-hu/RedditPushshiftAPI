Saying goodbye

Quit once before, lasted about 3 months. Had my last cigarette a couple of hours ago. Lit it knowing it would be the one. I've been slowing down over the past week or so after having started smoking again as a "social smoker". God knows how many I've smoked since. Right now I'm really feeling the effects of smoking. Cigarettes took my dad away from me 6 years ago, and I was ready to let them take me to. 5 years of smoking on and off and I'm starting see cigs like I see an ex lover; it's easy to remember all the good times when you're not with them, but I need to stop myself from going back, knowing all the harm they've caused. I'm better than cigarettes, and you are too. We'll be better off without them.

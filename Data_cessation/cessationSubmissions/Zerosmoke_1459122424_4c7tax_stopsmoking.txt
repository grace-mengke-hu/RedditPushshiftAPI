My anxiety...

Try not to let's your thoughts control you, I have a friend that I care for a lot and is on my mind a lot(kind of a love interest of sorts) and she said to me a few days ago.."why are you freaking out on me so much" it took me a while throughout the day to realize that I was taking the anxiety out on her since she is on my mind a lot, she smokes but hasnt made the step to quit yet so doesn't quite understand where I'm at in my quit progress.  Eventually she will quit and I will be there for her. But until then I am really concentrating on keep going my anxiety under wraps with deep breathing and I take a drive by myself for an hour or so ever hotbed day to let melt mind clear...how do you deal with your anxiety?

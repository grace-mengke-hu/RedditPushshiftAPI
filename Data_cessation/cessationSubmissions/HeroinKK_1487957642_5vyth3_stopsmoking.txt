The feeling of emptiness

Damn, this is my 6th day and most likley the worst one. It all went great until I left the job today. The combination of friday and that we are having a party at our house has woken up my baddest craving atm. I am just sitting at the party with such an empty feeling inside, that everything seems so dull and boring without cigrettes. There is nothing comming up. Damn it is hard. I am writting this so I could keep my thoughts from just walking out and buying a pack and then regret it at the same moment.

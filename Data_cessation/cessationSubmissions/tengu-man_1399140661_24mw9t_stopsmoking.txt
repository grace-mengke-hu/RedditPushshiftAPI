My arms hurt frequently. Is this a normal quitting pain, or something worse?

(Background: I quit smoking about a month ago, woo! I typically smoked 5 cigarettes per day. I smoked for 5 years. My heaviest smoking point was almost a pack a day, but that was 3 years ago.)

I have had a lot of aches and pains after quitting, but they are primarily in my upper body and arms. The pain is a dull ache that is mostly around my biceps. My neck, back and head have felt fine this month. I have not had severe headaches or anything (I feel very lucky), so I'm confused as to why this pain is just isolated to my arms.

I started doing Zumba shortly before quitting. A few weeks ago I had thought I was having post-workout pains in my arms, but my arms hurt regardless if I worked out that day or not. 

Has anyone else dealt with this? Is this simply workout pain, or something else? The arm pain doesn't come on as strongly as it did a few days after I quit; however, it's still here after a month, and that's a cause for concern.  I know my best bet right now is to see a doctor, and I need to do that anyway.

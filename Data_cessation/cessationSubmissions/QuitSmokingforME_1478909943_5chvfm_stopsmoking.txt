Freshman in College with Cystic Fibrosis who is trying to quit.

Hi everyone,

I am a freshman in college (18) with cystic fibrosis and smoking is affecting my health. My friends started vaping in high school and I stupidly picked one up myself. I used it for 1 1/2 years but recently threw it out my car window so I would stop. I couldn't take the craving so for the past two months I have been using the Mark-10 E cigarettes that you see at gas stations. 

I am not really addicted to the act of smoking, I don't have an oral fixation (I once quit vaping for a month during high school so I kind of know what it's like) but I am super addicted to the nicotine. I use it to sleep at night and it calms when I'm stressed. I work 25 hrs a week at a real estate agency and do school full-time so I am very busy. "Smoking" actually is affecting my lungs even though it's not cigarettes. I've noticed a decline in my health and I really want to quit I just feel like I can't. I'm too embarrassed to go to my family and doctors, who actually are supportive, but how could someone with a lung disease be so stupid to pick up this habit? 

I'm going to try and quit cold turkey and I know it will be hard, any support is appreciated. I'm very happy that I found this sub because I feel like I can at least talk about it. 

To put some minds at ease I don't have a serious form of Cystic Fibrosis in my lungs but I do in the rest of my body. While CF does affect my lungs, I don't have to be hospitalized for it, I can go on runs, and participate in sports. Since "smoking" I have a much harder time doing this and have a cough 24/7. I now cough up mucus on a daily basis which is completely new to me. 

I am not depressed or have an mental health issues, which is common with people that have CF. I smoke because it calms me and helps me get through the day when I'm stressed. Any support and/or advice is appreciated.

An Unexpected Test of Willpower

This past weekend I went to a concert with my brother who I have enjoyed many of smokes with over the years. I knew I was going to be tested but went in with a high level of confidence that I wouldn't falter. I also knew I would be drinking plenty of beers to make things  more interesting. 

Then something unexpected happened...

I ended up taking molly (AKA ecstasy) during the show and as a quick side bar I used to partake in such activities in my early twenties, especially during festivals and concerts  but now as a 28 year old, I may have a puff of weed every couple months but that is it.  

Well I got really high and it was a great time and I went through numerous attempts of talking myself into smoking including telling my brother that I was going to just have one because I mean I am rolling and having a grand ole time! But even in my altered state of mind I was consciously able to choose not to smoke. I mean I had the urge and all but never once even had one in my hand or really even truly thought I was going to cave.

The next morning my brother said he was proud of me and summed up the experience pretty well "Dude, if you can stay up all night on molly, being hammered, and hanging with me and still not smoke, then I can't think of a better testament to your urge to quit."

I know I will have hard days ahead but that experience brought my three weeks of being smoke free to a new level. Hell yes.

TL;DR Unexpectedly took Ecstasy and partied all night and consciously choose to not smoke and feeling fucking great about it.

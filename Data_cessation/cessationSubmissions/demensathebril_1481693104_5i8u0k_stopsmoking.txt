Using the gum, but at least I'm not smoking.

I'm 5 days since my last cigarette. I've been using the NRT gum to help me get through the beginning stages. I keep starting to feel like I need to quit the gum, but I'm trying to be patient with myself. 

It's been 5 days, which is longer than I've gone without a cigarette in at least 4 years.

Anyone else using the gum? Any tricks for tapering down an NRT?

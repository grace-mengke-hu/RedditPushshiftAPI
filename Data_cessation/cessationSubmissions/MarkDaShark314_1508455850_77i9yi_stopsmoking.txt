Has anyone attempted CBD extract to curb cravings?

I read it significantly reduces nicotine cravings in most people. Yesterday I bought 15ml of 100mg pure cbd oil. Even though I've had trouble putting the leaves down for good, but since I decided to quit. I as drag this Newport. I have noticed a reduced urge. I dose sublingually. I wonder if I should've invested in the vape, or the pills, or the candy. Has anyone else tried CBD or Kratom to quit smoking tobacco.

P.s. For the MJ tokers..I'll eventually remove myself from combustion altogether. Any suggestions?

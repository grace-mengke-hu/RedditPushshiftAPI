Smoked for 38 years. Day 14 tomorrow!

Tomorrow at 9 am it will be two weeks since I put out my last smoke. I started smoking at 13 years of age and at one stage was smoking 50 odd a day. Was down to 12 to 15 a day for the last year or so. Doing good and feeling good. Still craving but more the habit than the actual smokes. Am also avoiding all social situations for the next few months till I have this under control. Wish me luck as this is only the beginning of the journey!

Just wanted to add thank you to everyone who has offered support! Am now at 14 days and 5 hours Aussie east coast time. But who's counting??!!

3 months. Tabex is bloody brilliant.

It's been three months since I tried the Tabex 21 day Cytisine treatment and I've gotta say the stuff bloody worked. You definitely need to be in the right mindset to quit, but it sure as hell got me through the withdrawal phase like it was a cakewalk.

There have definitely been days that have tested me, and I still do spark up in my dreams now and then, but waking up and realising it was a dream is actually a relief that I didn't smoke rather than "Man even my dreams are teasing me" like I'd feared.

I've started doing 24/7 on call work for my tech support role which has really tested my stress levels over the last month (stuck at home, in my room with a phone and a laptop on weekends). There have also been a few stressful moments in my relationship. Some days have definitely felt like "Is something just throwing bullshit at me because it knows I've quit?", but I then think "Putting an unnecessary hole in your bank account is only going to make you stress more". Once the stressful day passes, I feel even more confident that I'll never go back.

If you haven't yet, I'd recommend checking tabex.net out and reading up on Cytisine smoking cessation.

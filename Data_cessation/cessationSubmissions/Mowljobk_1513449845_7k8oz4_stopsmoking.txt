Stopping again, hopefully

Since I stopped already once three days and then two weeks and my only weaknes was drinking, im pretty confident that I can do it this time. Now the new problem is, how can I overcome the strong urge to procristonate with stopping in the morning? My morning smokes are so routinly and it doesnt help that momentarly I dont have anything todo in my life. It would just be nice to hear some tips and a couple of encouraging things. 
Thank you!

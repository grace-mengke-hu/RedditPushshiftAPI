I got to stop smoking now or I'm gonna die

I'm 41 been smoking for 20 yrs..my son is 13 he looks up to me..I just played soccer with him and his 3 other buddies at the field..I was able to play..I played well, they were in awe of my skills even as a 41 yr old..I thought I can make an impact on my son for the rest of my life if I get rid of the one monkey on my back..I did it before for a year, but this was 15 yrs ago..I gotta do it now before I wish I did..suggestions ?! Best apps or sites or free patches or other sensation sites..thanks so much!!

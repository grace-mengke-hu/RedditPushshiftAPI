Getting over the "after I finish this pack..." mentality

I stopped for a week in Febuary of this year. Been trying to get back to non-smoker status since then without any headway (haven't gone more than about a day since then). Other than that and one other stretch of stopping - earlier in my career, I was 18 and hadn't been smoking long, so it was a lot easier - I notice myself falling into this dumbass loop.


Half a pack is left.

Option A. Finish pack and quit afterwards - does not ever work, normally just makes me smoke even more to 'get rid' of remaining cigs that day.

Option B. Throw pack away before I finish it, to prove how serious I am to myself. Inevitably end up feeling as though I wasted money, and turn into bum/buy another pack/take it out of trash...this is where I think the problem is.

Anyways. Been about 5 years of regular smoking, and it's a real detriment to excercise now. Help, advice, comments, experience would be cool. Thanks

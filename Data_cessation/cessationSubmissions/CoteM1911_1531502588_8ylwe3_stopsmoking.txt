How do people relapse after a year?

I guess this might be a dumb question but I keep seeing people post 'I havn't smoked for a year and I slipped up.' HOW?! I'm coming up on a year next month and I'm still all set with smoking. I still enjoy the smell of one and sometimes I think for a fleeting second, 'a smoke would be cool' But I def don't want one or ever feel like following through with that thought. All I can think about is how shitty it would taste. Ive had people offer me cigs when I'm hammered, smoke near me, I've even bought packs for others. My Grandmother has been quit for over 40 years and just told me the other day that she still would love a ciggarette. Not that she would, but she just remembered genuinly enjoying one from time to time. I think i feel that same way. That part of my life is totally over but I do rememebr the times I enjoyed them. I appreciate them, but I appreciate the things I enjoy now even more. I can't even fathom slipping up so I'm just wondering what the hell happens? Why did you relapse? What do I need to look out for? I really feel like I'm 100&amp;#37; over it.

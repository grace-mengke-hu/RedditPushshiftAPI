Every day since last Friday, I've had intense dreams where I was smoking.

No, seriously. The craziest, most intense dreams where I am say "Fuck it, let's light up." and I smoke an entire pack. In one of the dreams I bought a pack but all the cigarettes were rotted like they'd been wet and left to dry, and I went to take them back to the gas station and the cashier wouldn't replace them.

Bitch. 

And every time I wake up thinking "WHY THE FUCK DID I-- OH OKAY COOL YES SWEET."

Anyone else have dreams like this consistently when they quit?

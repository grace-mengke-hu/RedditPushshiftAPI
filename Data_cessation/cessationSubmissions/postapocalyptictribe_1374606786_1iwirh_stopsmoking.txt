First day with no cigarettes and I'm pretty sure I'm going to become a murderer soon.

Seriously my emotions are all over the place. I want to simultaneously cry and stab someone in the neck. I also keep feeling a little light headed and like all my muscles all over my body are tense. 

Is this normal? Can I do anything about it? If I murder someone is there a way to claim cigarette psychosis? 

Edit: I didn't make it through my first day. :( I went the the convenience store while hiccup crying and made the cashier very uncomfortable.

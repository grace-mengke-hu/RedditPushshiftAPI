Quit the chemicals that could have killed me tomorrow, having trouble with quitting the one that will kill me by 60

Alright, what's up guys. So I'm a young guy in recovery from drug abuse and alcoholism. I've got a little over a year clean off that shit. Cool.

Now I'm starting to think about quitting smoking. I don't like the grind, and it reminds me of being a fucking fiend. Especially when I'm strapped for cash and searching my couch for money to buy a pack.

With that in mind, I'm conflicted about quitting. With the drugs and alcohol I had a definite bottom. I realized it wasn't working and did what I needed to do to quit. So I went to a rehab, and did all that good stuff. Because I had a selfish reason that was right in front of my eyes to quit. 
I was going to die, tomorrow, if not sooner from that shit. But with the cigarettes I just can't seem to muster any desire to stop even though I know it's the rational thing to do. 

Additionally, I don't know if you guys have ever been to an AA/NA meeting but holy fucking shit balls it's like the 1940s there. I want to know if you guys find yourself having to avoid smokers.

I don't really need a list of all the negatives of smoking, I know them, but what I would like are some suggestions of how you stopped. Whether it was gum, or and e-cig, or some medication, or whatever. Just help me wrap my mind around a way to quit and maybe I'll get there

Thanks for your time everybody

TL;DR
Do I have to avoid smokers?

What methods work for quitting?

Do I need to hit a bottom? (I'm not really sick and tired of being sick and tired with the smokes)

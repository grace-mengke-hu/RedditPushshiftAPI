Smoking and Varicose Veins?

I recall in Allen Carr's book he mentioned his varicose veins going away after he quit smoking. I can't really find any research that links the two. I started getting some real nasty ones on the back of my knee about a year ago that bother me a lot (no pain, they just look disgusting). I've only ever seen them on either overweight, older, more fair-skinned people, and they tend to be females (usually a combination of the 4). I'm none of those. I'm a 26yr old male, in pretty good shape, and exercise daily. 

So, anyone have any experience with these, or seen hem improve or go away after quitting?

2 weeks, Almost. First night of drinks , need some strength.

Hi guys. Quit last Sunday and haven't smoked since.  Been feeling better and better day by day and the cravings have been less and less intrusive.  

However today is my first night having a few drinks and I must say that the cravings are strong.  I skipped last weekend because u knew this would be tough. 

It's not that I physically crave the cigarettes like I used to, but rather I am so used to smoking while drinking that I'm getting the worst psychological cravings I've had so far. 

For the past two weeks I've been living well in the mindset that I am now a non smoker. However tonight im feeling like a smoker who hasn't smoked for 11 days. 

Sorry for the wall of text. It's therapeutic  in its own way to write my feelings down like this.  But please, those who have overcome this hurdle in your journey to freedom, give me some support and words of wisdom!

Thanks on advance, this sub has been a godsend for me, come here all the time to read successes and motivation

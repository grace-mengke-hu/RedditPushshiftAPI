I need some guidance, please.

I haven't smoked for about 5 months now. The problem is, every time I drink alcohol alone, I get really bad cravings. It's weird, because at parties I can do without smoking. It's actually not that big of a problem that I crave when alone, because then I can just be too lazy to go to the store, but I'm afraid, that these cravings can transfer to parties. Any ideas? Suggestions? I don't really know what I'm asking, actually.

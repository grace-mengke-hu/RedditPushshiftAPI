72 hours in after a decade of smoking

Hey after a decade of smoking I have quit cold turkey. I just got to my breaking point and can't keep being a slave to this addiction.   


Anyone with experience quitting for a long time know will the cravings ease up a bit? Will I be able to have days where I'm not thinking about smoking/not smoking all day.   


Thanks and good luck to everyone. This has been a really hard three days but I think it is starting to feel like its easing up

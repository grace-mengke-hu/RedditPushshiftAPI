week two, lots of irritability and bouts of sadness, advice welcome

hi all, day 11 here. To be honest, first week was pretty uneventful and low-key, but now that I'm in week 2 I feel like shit has hit the fan. Physical symptoms are nonexistent but I'm really struggling with irritability, mood swings, and mild bouts of depression.  
  
i know I'm doing the right thing, but I've been so ill tempered and emotionally flustered the past two days, which makes me feel like a failure/baby, which is probably why the depression kicks in. I feel like it definitely doesn't help that I don't have smoker friends who have gone through this to talk to. I definitely don't feel like I can talk to my non-smoker friends because they would probably feel some mixture between annoyance or confusion from my venting.  
  
Any advice or words of encouragement would be greatly appreciated. Thanks everyone.

Vivid dreams and restless sleep from going cold turkey - is this normal?

For most of my life, I've slept so deeply that I've never remembered my dreams. For the past few months, I've been having really vivid HD quality dreams/nightmares and they're actually making me tired when I wake up. I just realized that this coincides with me quitting. I quit cold turkey, so I never thought it could be related but has this happened to anyone else? :)
